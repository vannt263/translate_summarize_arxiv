    "one of the foremost goals in the study of cosmological reionization is determining the sources of the ionizing photons .",
    "quasars ( qsos ) , while able to maintain an ionized universe from @xmath13 @xcite , rapidly fall in number density at redshifts greater than @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the faint - end slope of the qso luminosity function indicate that while the qso contribution to the overall ionizing budget at @xmath15 may not be negligible , qsos alone are still unable to sufficiently account for all of the ionizing radiation during the epoch of reionization @xcite . it is generally assumed that star - forming galaxies fill in the remainder of the gap in the ionizing budget .",
    "therefore , studying the ionizing lyman - continuum ( lyc ) properties of high - redshift star - forming galaxies can provide vital information about the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . because the igm at @xmath16 is opaque to lyc photons",
    ", we can not directly observe the ionizing radiation at the redshifts corresponding to reionization . in order to directly measure the ionizing radiation escaping galaxies and study the galactic properties that give rise to significant lyc escape fractions",
    ", we must locate and study lower - redshift analogs to the star - forming galaxies that reionized the universe .",
    "there have been several recent studies of lyc emission at both low and intermediate redshifts . to probe @xmath17 , space - based far - uv observing facilities such as @xmath18/stis , @xmath19 , and",
    "@xmath20 have searched for lyc radiation from star - forming galaxies @xcite only to obtain null results ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath21",
    ", ground - based optical studies have shown that roughly 10% of star - forming galaxies have a moderately high escape fraction of ionizing radiation ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at even higher redshift ( @xmath23 ) , @xcite find only one lyc - emitter out of 102 lbgs , although this small number of lyc detections might reasonably be attributed to the rapidly increasing igm opacity rather than to processes internal to galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigate the conspicuous lack of lyc - emitting galaxies at low redshift , where lyc transmission through the igm is high .",
    "given the similar stellar populations for uv - luminous galaxies at @xmath24 and @xmath21 , @xcite infer that lyc production does not change with redshift but the mechanism governing lyc escape must vary .",
    "one key observational method used to measure lyc flux is deep imaging through a narrowband filter tuned to wavelengths just bluewards of the lyman limit .",
    "narrowband imaging provides a very effective way to simultaneously probe the lyc of large samples of galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "we have designed a narrowband imaging program to study the lyc properties of galaxies in the hs1549 + 1919 field .",
    "this field was observed as part of a larger survey of uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath25 @xcite and contains a galaxy protocluster with a redshift - space overdensity of @xmath26 at @xmath27 ( figure [ fig_zhist ] ) .",
    "the  spike \" redshift coincides with that of a hyperluminous qso @xcite .",
    "more than 350 uv - selected galaxies have been identified in the hs1549 field , @xmath28 of which have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , narrowband imaging with a 4670  filter tuned to the wavelength of ly@xmath2  at the redshift spike has revealed @xmath30300 potential ly@xmath2  emitters ( laes ) and several ly@xmath2   blobs \" @xcite .",
    "such a large sample of star - forming galaxies at approximately the same redshift greatly facilitates the systematic narrowband imaging search for leaking lyc emission .    our work in the hs1549 field parallels that of @xcite and @xcite , who investigated another high - redshift protocluster ( ssa22a ; @xmath31 ) .",
    "several questions emerged from these initial narrowband lyc studies , including the nature of galaxies with large offsets ( occasionally reaching several kpc ) between the centroids of their non - ionizing uv - continuum and lyc emission . while significant offsets have been predicted in some simulations modeling the escape of ionizing photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in practice it is difficult to determine whether the observed offsets provide information about the interstellar medium of a lyc - leaking galaxy , or are simply the result of a foreground contaminant @xcite .",
    "another key result presented in the ssa22a studies is the high apparent ratio of escaping ionizing to non - ionizing uv radiation measured for several laes .",
    "for some objects , this ratio exceeded unity @xcite .",
    "if such measurements are free of foreground contamination , they are at odds with standard models for the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of star - forming galaxies @xcite . consequently , as discussed by @xcite , the most critical goal for lyc studies is to minimize the possibility that candidate lyc - leaking galaxies are contaminated by low - redshift interlopers . while previous @xmath32 lyc studies have been plagued by small samples and lack of spectroscopic redshifts , in this work we present a sample of 131 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies ( 49 lbgs and 91 laes , 9 of which are constituents of both samples ) .",
    "while our seeing - limited , ground - based imaging makes it difficult to distinguish individual cases of foreground contamination , we have performed simulations to model the amount of expected contamination in our samples as a whole ( as in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we build upon previous high - redshift lyc studies by considering a large spectroscopic sample of galaxies in an independent field from the ssa22a observations .",
    "we present imaging for 12 new @xmath0 galaxies with putative lyc detections and correct for foreground contamination and igm absorption . for our lbg and lae samples ,",
    "we calculate the escape fraction of ionizing photons both in an absolute sense and relative to the escape fraction of non - ionizing uv photons .",
    "we also explore the differential multiwavelength properties of objects with and without leaking lyc radiation with regard to their ly@xmath2  equivalent widths , rest - frame near - infrared photometry , and stellar populations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec_obsred ] , we describe our observations , data reduction , and galaxy sample . in section [ sec_ana ]",

    "for observations of lyc emission , we used a custom narrowband filter manufactured by barr associates with central wavelength 3420  and fwhm 105 . this filter",
    "( hereafter referred to as nb3420 ) is designed to probe the lyc region blueward of 912  for galaxies at @xmath38 such that no contaminating flux ( @xmath39 ) from the galaxy s non - ionizing uv continuum is transmitted .",
    "the filter lies well within one lyc mean free path for galaxies at @xmath37 , minimizing the effect of intervening lyman limit systems and allowing for a more direct probe of the lyc absorption properties internal to galaxies . at a redshift of 2.85 , current estimates place the lyc mean free path at @xmath30 100 proper mpc @xcite which corresponds to a rest - frame wavelength interval of @xmath40 . at @xmath37 , the range of rest - frame wavelengths probed by the nb3420 filter is @xmath41 .",

    "our imaging was centered on the hs1549 field , at ( @xmath2 , @xmath43 ) = ( 15:51:53.7 , + 19:10:42.3 ) .",

    "because these models support the possibility that the spatial distribution of lyc emission may be offset from @xmath60band emission or have different morphology ( e.g. , compact vs. diffuse ) , we must choose photometric methods that can account for such scenarios .    while @xcite suggest that flux - density ratios should be measured using both lyc and non - ionizing uv emission _ only _ from regions of escaping lyc emission , we argue here that the entire non - ionizing and ionizing uv flux should be measured . measuring the flux - density ratio within an individual lyc - emitting region ( defined by the isophote of the lyc emission ) may provide useful information about the stellar populations of that region ,",
    "but it does not provide information about the average lyc escape fraction among star - forming galaxies or the global lyc emissivity produced by these galaxies .",
    "the average escape fraction must be computed from the non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratio of an ensemble of @xmath21 galaxies , including both galaxies without observed lyc emission and the non - lyc - emitting regions from galaxies with lyc emission .",
    "the calculation of the ionizing emissivity , moreover , relies entirely on the @xmath21 uv luminosity function constructed by measuring non - ionizing uv light from _ entire _ galaxies , not from their constituent clumps .",
    "alternatively , we find that a method in which lyc is measured solely within an isophote defined by the galaxy s non - ionizing uv also does not accomplish our photometric goals . as this",
    " isophotoal \" method does not allow for lyc emission to have a different spatial distribution from that of the non - ionizing uv , it will result in the systematic loss of lyc flux . a differential analysis of lae magnitudes using this isophotal photometric method versus the  kron - like \" apertures to measure @xmath60band and nb3420 magnitudes separately ( i.e. , the method presented here ) corroborates the idea that lyc emission is systematically missed in the isophotal method ; the average lae non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratio using the isophotal method is a factor of @xmath105 larger than the methods we use . while a factor of 1.3 is well within the 1@xmath106 uncertaintyband detections .",
    "] , it is an unnecessary loss of nb3420 flux .",
    "therefore , we maintain that using the large  kron - like \" apertures to measure the full @xmath60band and nb3420 magnitudes is the correct photometric method for the measurement of the global lyc escape fraction and emissivity .",
    "we characterized both the statistical and systematic photometric uncertainties by running monte carlo simulations designed to reproduce our photometric measurement procedures . in the simulations",
    ", we added to each image fake galaxies of known magnitude and a range of radial profiles representative of the observed galaxies . in each iteration",
    ", one hundred fake galaxies were placed in random , empty positions chosen to avoid image edges and photometric blending with existing objects or previously placed fake galaxies .",
    "we ran sextractor on each filter ( @xmath52 , @xmath3 , nb3420 ) using the same parameters as for the actual photometry .",
    "the process of adding fake galaxies was repeated until we recovered 50,000 in each simulation , enough to populate all magnitude bins of interest with a statistically significant number of objects .",
    "the bins of recovered magnitude are 0.5 magnitudes wide and span a range of @xmath107 in each band to encompass the magnitude range of the observed lbgs and laes .",
    "table [ tab_sim ] lists the systematic bias and photometric uncertainty associated with each magnitude bin , as derived from the results of the simulations . in each bin",
    ", the systematic bias is defined to be the average difference between input and recovered fluxes of fake galaxies , while the photometric uncertainty is defined to be the standard deviation of the distribution of differences between input and recovered fluxes .",
    "the uncertainty associated with an object of a given flux is a local quadratic interpolation between the uncertainties of neighboring bins . because the errors in flux are gaussian , all errors quoted in magnitudes are double - sided . using the uncertainties estimated by our simulations ,",
    "we define a 2@xmath106 photometric limit that corresponds to a magnitude limit of 27.33 in @xmath52 , 27.58 in @xmath3 , and 27.30 in nb3420 . in all filters ,",
    "the simulations show that sextractor misses a higher percentage of flux from fainter objects , resulting in a systematic offset in magnitude that is larger for fainter objects . in order to correct for this bias",
    ", we added the systematic offset determined from the simulation analysis to the flux of an object if the offset was greater than one third of the object s associated uncertainty .",
    "this threshold was chosen in order to avoid the unnecessary addition of noise into our measurements by adding systematic offsets much smaller than the 1@xmath106 error . in practice , this correction only affected a few of the fainter bins ( see table [ tab_sim ] ) .",
    "as we have two broadband filters ( @xmath3 and @xmath52 ) that probe the non - ionizing rest - frame uv ( @xmath301500 ) for galaxies at @xmath37 , it is necessary to choose one to represent the non - ionizing uv flux .",
    "the spatial distributions of the @xmath3 and @xmath52 detections are well matched and their centroids agree within 02 .",
    "the deeper @xmath60band image has 10 seeing , while the @xmath52 image has 13 seeing , larger photometric errors ( see table [ tab_sim ] ) , and an elongated psf .",
    "although the @xmath108band image was originally used to identify lbgs , we adopt the @xmath60band image for our non - ionizing uv photometry based on its superior quality and the fact that more laes are detected in @xmath3 than in @xmath52 .",
    "we note that all but one of the lbgs with lyc detections is detected in @xmath3 ; m4 does not have a @xmath3 detection because it falls off the edge of the @xmath3-band image .",
    "for this object , we calculate a @xmath3 magnitude by linearly interpolating between its measured @xmath52 magnitude and a @xmath51 magnitude computed from its @xmath109 color obtained from the parent lbg survey @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of lbgs are defined by @xmath60band centroids , while the coordinates of laes are defined by nb4670 centroids . in order to find non - ionizing rest - frame uv counterparts for laes ,",
    "we compiled the positions and photometric measurements for any sextractor detection in the @xmath60band image within a 5 pixel ( 11 = 8.6 kpc at @xmath37 ) offset from the nb4670 coordinates of the target and successfully found counterparts for 77 out of 91 laes . given that the largest galaxies reach sizes of @xmath110 kpc at @xmath111 @xcite and that we may be looking for lyc emission in the outskirts of these galaxies , we used a similar matching technique with a larger radius ( 9 pixel = 19 = 14.8 kpc at @xmath37 ) to find sextractor detections in the nb3420 image near our lbgs and laes .",
    "this generous matching radius guarantees the inclusion of all nb3420 detections potentially associated with the galaxies in the sample .",
    "our candidate with the largest offset between the galaxy centroid and the associated nb3420 detection ( m16 ) has @xmath112 kpc , but the majority of our nb3420 detections ( especially around laes ) are at much smaller offset ( @xmath113  kpc ) .    in order to remove any obvious false matches corresponding to neighboring sources",
    ", we visually inspected each nb3420 source matched with a known lbg or lae in the @xmath52 , @xmath3 , and @xmath51 images ( probing rest - frame non - ionizing uv ) , and the @xmath56 image ( probing rest - frame optical ) , if available .",
    "we also inspected laes with nb3420 matches in the continuum - subtracted nb4670@xmath4 image , which probes the spatial distribution of ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "nb3420 matches were removed if they corresponded spatially to a visible counterpart in another image .",
    "we also removed matches where the lyc emission was further than 19 away from the non - ionizing uv - continuum emission , which occasionally occurred because the lae matching radius was centered around the ly@xmath2  emission , not the non - ionizing uv .",
    "altogether , we retained matches to 4 lbgs and 7 laes , labeling the nb3420 detections corresponding to 4 lbgs and 16 laes as invalid .",
    "we report nb3420 detections in 4 out of 48 lbgs and 7 out of 90 laes .",
    "md12/_lae3540 _ also has an nb3420 detection and is discussed in section [ ssec_nbmorph ] .",
    "although they are not the focus of our study , we note that 2 of the 4 agns in the field at @xmath38 have nb3420 detections .",
    "tables [ tab_lbg ] and [ tab_lae ] display photometric information for the nb3420-detected lbgs and laes .",
    "postage - stamp images of targets with nb3420 detections are shown in figures [ fig_lbg ] and [ fig_lae ] , indicating the nb3420 ( lyc ) , nb4670@xmath4 ( ly@xmath2 ) , and @xmath3 ( non - ionizing uv continuum ) morphologies .",

    "however , while it is a good rule of thumb to assume that objects with @xmath163  are likely contaminants , @xcite demonstrated with high - resolution spectroscopy in the ssa22a field individual cases where putative lyc detections at large offset ( for example , @xmath16410 ) were found to be associated with the high - redshift galaxy , and detections at small offset ( for example , @xmath16403 ) were found to be contaminants .",

    "stacked image photometry was performed using the iraf phot routine using a 19 aperture , corresponding to the matching radius used to find detections .",
    "although the postage stamps for individual galaxies were previously background subtracted as part of the data reduction process , we found that a second pass of background subtraction on the stacked image was necessary to remove remaining sky subtraction systematics .",

    "these limits reflect only photometric errors .",
    "we note that for the nb3420 stacks of all lbgs and all laes , the addition of noise from a large number of galaxies undetected in nb3420 overpowered the signal from the few detected galaxies .",
    "as the resulting signal in the stack was detected at less than 3@xmath106 , we quote a lower limit in magnitude in table [ tab_stacks ] .",
    "in narrowband imaging studies of @xmath21 lyc emission , it is critical to determine whether the detection in the narrowband filter is actually high - redshift lyc emission or contaminating radiation from a lower - redshift object . in this section ,",

    "while it is not possible to determine in the @xmath3-band image whether the uv - continuum light associated with the lae belongs to multiple objects or whether it is merely extended , there are two distinct galaxies visible in the @xmath57 image . since the northeastern galaxy is associated with the nb3420 detection while the southwestern galaxy is associated with the ly@xmath2  emission , we classify this system as a case of contamination .",
    "we also highlight one object whose complex morphology led us to remove it from our analysis completely .",
    "this object ( shown in figure [ fig_md12 ] , with multiple clumps indicated ) was originally identified in our catalogs as both an lbg ( md12 ) and an lae ( _ lae3540 _ ) , with both the lbg and lae centroids coincident with the bright @xmath60band detection ( indicated by region a ) . analysis of the ly@xmath2  morphology in both the nb4670@xmath4 and nb4670@xmath62 images reveals extended emission in both ly@xmath2  images .",
    "although both ly@xmath2  images show nearly identical morphology for all other laes with nb3420 detections , the extended ly@xmath2  emission around md12 appears clumpy in the nb4670@xmath4 image ( associated with regions b , c , and d ) and more diffuse in the nb4670@xmath62 image .",
    "also , while the ly@xmath2  emission appears to extend down to region c where the nb3420 detection is located ( 10 to the south of the lbg centroid ) , this location is also coincident with detections in the @xmath57 and @xmath56 images that are not visibly connected to the lbg centroid in region a. unfortunately , due to the slit position of @xmath167 , the lris spectrum of this object only provides us with information about region a ( where we observe double - peaked ly@xmath2  emission in the spectrum ) and misses the region associated with the nb3420 detection .",
    "we note that region e likely indicates a lower - redshift interloper along the line of sight , as its position does not coincide with ly@xmath2  emission and it is located at the large offset of 21 from region a ( the centroid of md12 ) .    the interpretation of the suite of imaging for md12 is not straightforward , and it is impossible to fully understand the nature of these clumps with the current data .",
    "the clumps may comprise an extended , perhaps interacting , system , with all clumps at the same redshift .",
    "alternatively , as region a has ly@xmath2  emission in its spectrum and regions b , c , and d are all associated with fairly compact ly@xmath2  emission in the nb4670@xmath4 image , these four clumps may simply be several protocluster members along the line of sight located at slightly different redshifts ; in this case , they should be treated as separate laes .",
    "a final possibility ( supported by the fact that the ly@xmath2  emission appears diffuse in the nb4670@xmath62 image ) is that the extended ly@xmath2  emission actually originates in the central part of the md12 system and is being projected over a large area ; in this case , the clump with the nb3420 emission in region c may be an interloper along the line of sight . because of the ambiguity regarding the nature of md12 as a either single , complex system or the superposition of multiple galaxies , we exclude both md12 and _ lae3540 _ from our lbg and lae analysis",
    "nevertheless , this object represents another possible lyc - emitter .    determining conclusively whether the nb3420 detections are contamination or true lyc emission requires imaging of each candidate galaxy with high enough resolution to discern the individual clumps and spectroscopy at high enough resolution that distinct spectra are obtained ( and redshifts calculated ) for each emitting region .",
    "this method has been recently implemented in the ssa22a field using @xmath18/wfc3/@xmath168 to acquire high - resolution imaging below the lyman limit for three @xmath169 lbgs .",
    "additionally , near - infrared spectroscopy of rest - frame optical [ oiii ] nebular emission was obtained using nirspec on keck ii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* siana et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the seeing of @xmath3005 for these near - infrared observations enabled the spatial separation of clumps .",
    "one of three lbgs was confirmed to have escaping lyc radiation , and two others showed evidence of low - redshift contamination .",
    "unfortunately , a similar study for the hs1549 field is not possible using ground - based or current space - based instrumentation .",
    "there is no appropriate imaging filter on @xmath18 that probes the region just below the lyman limit at @xmath37 without some contamination redwards of the limit .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopy from the ground is unfeasible because the rest - frame optical features do not fall within windows of atmospheric transmission at @xmath37 .",
    "the next best option is to estimate photometric redshifts of each clump by acquiring high - resolution multi - band imaging .",
    "such a technique has been successfully employed by @xcite for a sample of 19 lbgs with potential lyc emission at @xmath170 using multi - band hst imaging from the goods and candels surveys .",
    "although we currently do not have the high - resolution imaging or spectroscopic data required to prove the validity of each individual lyc detection , we can characterize the probability of foreground contamination statistically .",
    "with the assumption that all of our targets have been correctly identified as high - redshift galaxies , the nb3420 flux we measured can either be associated with lyc emission from the high - redshift galaxy itself or with contaminating radiation from a spatially coincident lower - redshift interloper . in order to statistically characterize the fraction of contaminated nb3420 detections in a given sample , we performed a simulation to calculate the expected number of uncontaminated lyc detections and the contamination - corrected average nb3420 magnitude for that sample .",
    "we summarize the simulation below , and further details are described in section 5.1 of @xcite .",
    "the contamination simulation was run separately for the lbgs and laes . within the simulation",
    ", we considered as possible lyc detections all nb3420 sextractor detections within 35 of our targets that fall within 1@xmath106 of the magnitude range of our reported lyc detections , corresponding to @xmath171 for lbgs and @xmath172 for laes .",
    "these sextractor detections included both the detections considered to be candidates for lyc emission and detections previously identified by eye as belonging to interlopers visible in other wavelength bands .",
    "we computed the probability of each nb3420 detection being an interloper , which depends on both the global surface density of objects in the nb3420 image and the local surface density at the offset of the nb3420 detection from each lbg and lae .",
    "in each iteration of the simulation , we used these probabilities to randomly determine whether or not each nb3420 detection was flagged as an interloper .",
    "detections at large radial offset @xmath44 where the local surface density approaches the global surface density @xmath44 are more likely to be flagged as interlopers , as demonstrated in figure [ fig_contam_hist ] .",
    "we removed the nb3420 magnitudes of objects flagged as interlopers before the average nb3420 magnitude was calculated , resulting in the contamination - corrected average nb3420 magnitude .",
    "the simulation was repeated 1000 times , and we recorded the average number of uncontaminated nb3420 detections and the average contamination - corrected nb3420 magnitude for both samples .",
    "uncertainties in these average values were computed from the distribution of simulation results .    in figure",
    "[ fig_contam_hist ] , we present histograms of the radial surface density of nb3420 detections around galaxies in the lbg and lae samples , compared to the global surface density .",
    "the surface density of nb3420 detections is plotted using nb3420 offsets computed relative to @xmath60band ( non - ionizing uv continuum ) for lbgs . for laes ,",
    "offsets were computed relative to both @xmath60band and nb4670 ( a combination of ly@xmath2  and continuum emission in the vicinity of the ly@xmath2  wavelength ) . as discussed in section [ ssec_det ] ,",
    "lyc emission is spatially more closely associated with the uv - continuum than with ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath3-band coordinates to represent the lae centroids , except in cases where the lae is undetected in @xmath3 and we must use nb4670 coordinates .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) of figure [ fig_contam_hist ] , displaying @xmath60band and nb4670 offsets , respectively , confirm that lyc emission is on average more closely associated with @xmath60band emission than with nb4670 , as the average offset in panel ( b ) is less than that in panel ( c ) .",
    "all panels show an excess surface density at small offsets ( although this excess is only statistically significant for the laes ) , suggesting that a large number of the nb3420 detections are physically associated with the lbg and lae targets ; the contamination simulation statistically quantifies this number .",
    "for the 4 lbgs detected in nb3420 , the simulations predict on average 1.5 @xmath114 1.0 uncontaminated detections .",
    "for the 7 nb3420-detected laes , the simulations predict 4.3 @xmath114 1.3 uncontaminated detections . for both samples , the simulation yields the contamination - corrected average magnitude of the nb3420 detections .",
    "these values are used to compute the sample - averaged nb3420@xmath4 colors and flux - density ratios presented in table [ tab_final_avg_flux_ratios ] and discussed in section [ sec_res ] .",
    "we note that the removal of contaminants must increase the non - ionizing uv to lyc flux - density ratio for the ensembles containing the full sample of lbgs ( or laes ) , as the total amount of lyc flux is decreased when a contaminant is removed while the total amount of non - ionizing uv flux stays the same . for ensembles that contain only objects with nb3420 detections , however , the flux - density ratio may not necessarily increase with the removal of the contaminants . in these cases ,",
    "when an nb3420 detection is identified as a contaminant , both its lyc and non - ionizing uv emission are omitted from the sample when calculating the flux - density ratio as the object is no longer considered to have a true lyc detection .",
    "in addition to correcting for contamination by low - redshift galaxies , we must also correct the nb3420 photometry for the absorption of lyc photons by neutral hydrogen in the igm . in order to account for such attenuation , we ran a second set of simulations to determine the mean igm correction factor and its associated uncertainty .",
    "we note that , as discussed in @xcite , our simulations do not take into account the possible environmental effects due to the presence of the @xmath0 protocluster and the proximity to the hyperluminous qso ( q1549 ) , and it is not clear whether such effects would culminate in an increase or decrease of neutral hydrogen absorbers .",
    "we summarize the methods employed below , and further details are described in @xcite and @xcite , the latter of which describes the current version of the methodology .",
    "first , we constructed 500 model sightlines simulating the distribution of hi absorbers in the igm . for each model sightline",
    ", absorbers were drawn randomly from their redshift and column density distributions @xcite , spanning redshifts from @xmath173 to the redshift of each object of interest .",
    "the model sightlines for the laes were created at the mean redshift of the laes ( @xmath37 ) since the narrow width of the nb4670 filter implies that the lae targets lie within a small redshift range .",
    "given that the lbgs span a wider range in redshift ( @xmath174 ) , we created a set of 500 model sightlines at the redshift of each lbg .",
    "we then calculated the mean transmission of each model sightline in the lyc region .",
    "for the purposes of these simulations , the lyc region consists of the fixed observed - frame bandpass of the nb3420 filter , taking into account the filter transmission profile .",
    "figure [ fig_igm ] shows the probability distributions of the lyc transmission factor for model sightlines at @xmath37 ( representing typical lae redshifts ) and @xmath175 ( corresponding to our highest - redshift lbg with the most extreme case of attenuation ) .",
    "the sample average transmission through the igm ( @xmath176 ) is equal to the mean transmission of the 500 @xmath37 sightlines for the laes and the mean transmission of all model sightlines for the lbgs at different redshifts .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath176 is estimated by first assuming an exponential distribution of unattenuated lyc flux ( the parameters of this exponential function are fit to our data via a maximum likelihood method , see * ? ? ? * ) and then creating 1000 realizations of our sample by randomly choosing for each galaxy an unattenuated lyc flux from our exponential distribution and an attentuation factor from one of the simulated model sightlines at the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "we set the uncertainty in @xmath176 equal to the standard deviation of the 1000 simulated @xmath176 values .",
    "we find that @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "for both the lbg and lae samples , we multiply the contamination - corrected non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratios by the transmission factor to obtain the igm - and - contamination - corrected values presented in table [ tab_final_avg_flux_ratios ] . unlike the contamination correction discussed in section [ sssec_foreground_contam ] , which decreases the average nb3420 flux",
    ", the igm attenuation correction acts to increase it .",
    "in order to study the amount of ionizing radiation escaping star - forming galaxies at high redshift , we have imaged a large sample of @xmath88 galaxies in a narrowband filter designed to probe lyc emission .",
    "as described in section [ ssec_det ] , we have detected 4 out of 48 lbgs and 7 out of 90 laes in our nb3420 filter .",
    "after application of the contamination and igm corrections discussed in sections [ sssec_foreground_contam ] and [ sssec_igm_corr ] , the average nb3420@xmath4 properties of the galaxies in our sample provide information about the ratio of non - ionizing to ionizing uv flux density and , with some assumptions , the lyc escape fraction .      in figure [ fig_cmd ] ,",
    "we plot nb3420@xmath4 color versus @xmath3 magnitude for lbgs and laes with nb3420 detections . the colors of the lbg and lae stacks are also plotted .",
    "all of the data presented in figure [ fig_cmd ] represent observed values , uncorrected for foreground galaxy contamination and igm absorption .",
    "qualitatively , the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for objects in the hs1549 field agrees with the cmd for objects in the ssa22a field @xcite ; both samples of galaxies exhibit narrowband minus continuum colors across a wide range of continuum magnitudes that are extremely blue with respect to expectations from standard stellar population models .",
    "for example , @xcite models with solar metallicity and a constant star - formation rate predict the intrinsic ratio of non - ionizing to ionizing radiation for laes to be roughly 3 @xmath44 6 , which corresponds to an nb3420@xmath4 color of 1.2 @xmath44 2 . out of the 7 laes with nb3420 detections ,",
    "only one lae ( _ lae6662 _ ) has a color redder than 1.2 .",
    "even more surprising , especially given the small offsets ( @xmath179 kpc ) of all laes except _ lae6662 _ , 4 of the 6 remaining laes have nb3420@xmath180 , implying a complete absence of a lyman break ( i.e. , a flat spectrum ) . for typical lbg stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the intrinsic ratio is predicted to be @xmath636 ( corresponding to an nb3420@xmath4 color @xmath632 ) ; however , two out of the four nb3420-detected lbgs have nb3420@xmath181 .",
    "thus , the hs1549 field provides the first confirmation that the blue non - ionizing to ionizing uv colors observed in the ssa22a field are common among @xmath21 galaxies , and not simply an unusual property of the ssa22a field itself .",
    "tables [ tab_lbg ] and [ tab_lae ] display the raw non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratios ( @xmath182 ) for individual lbgs and laes with nb3420 detections , and table [ tab_stacks ] shows the same values for the stacks .    the average corrected and uncorrected nb3420@xmath4 colors and flux - density ratios for the samples of lbgs and laes are presented in table [ tab_final_avg_flux_ratios ] . because photometry of the stacks of lbgs and laes without nb3420 detections does not yield any nb3420 signal ,",
    "we determine average nb3420 and @xmath3 magnitudes by calculating the mean flux of all the galaxies in each sample and assuming zero flux for undetected objects .",
    "these average magnitudes agree with stacked photometry within the errors . as our @xmath3 and nb3420 filters probe rest - frame wavelengths of 1430  and 888 , respectively , we can convert our observed nb3420@xmath4 colors directly into non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratios ( i.e. , @xmath182 ) .",
    "we find uncorrected flux - density ratios of @xmath183 for lbgs and @xmath184 for laes .",
    "considering only objects with nb3420 detections in each sample , we find @xmath185 for lbgs and @xmath186 for laes . in order to correct these colors and flux - density ratios for foreground contamination ,",
    "we use adjusted nb3420 and @xmath3 magnitudes derived from the contamination simulation described in section [ sssec_foreground_contam ] . correcting for igm attenuation , however , only affects nb3420 magnitudes because rest - frame @xmath301500  flux is not affected by hi absportion in the igm . thus , for the igm correction we simply multiply the contamination - corrected flux - density ratio by the igm transmission factor . with the application of these two corrections to the colors and flux - density ratios , we find @xmath187 for lbgs and @xmath188 for laes . for objects with nb3420 detections ,",

    "many of the values in table [ tab_final_avg_flux_ratios ] @xmath44 and especially those that consider only the nb3420-detected galaxies @xmath44 do not fall within the theoretical range .",

    "@xcite examined a wider range of theoretical @xmath216 values using stellar population synthesis models from @xcite and the bpass models from @xcite , which include a more detailed treatment of massive stellar binaries ( specifically , wolf - rayet stars ) and nebular emission .",
    "the models were used to describe galaxies with an array of ages and metallicities , assuming a constant star - formation rate .",
    "the largest source of variation in @xmath216 is due to the age of the galaxy , as @xmath216 increases quickly as the stellar population evolves .",
    "the choice of model is also important , as the bpass models predict ratios of @xmath216 a factor of @xmath301.5 lower than the @xcite models for a given age and metallicity .",
    "changes in stellar metallicity cause smaller variations in @xmath216 on the order of a few percent , but the magnitude of these changes increases with the age of the stellar population .",
    "it is important to note that , if the models are correct , the predicted value for @xmath216 should serve as a lower limit to the observed non - ionizing to ionizing flux - density ratio of the galaxy .",
    "the observed flux - density ratio will likely be higher than this limit , as ionizing radiation may be absorbed by neutral hydrogen in both the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy and the igm .",
    "thus , for any given galaxy , the observed value of @xmath182 should be greater than or equal to @xmath216 .",
    "we note that the two sets of stellar population synthesis models used in this analysis , as with all such models , are limited by the absence of direct observations in the lyc region of the o- and b - type stars that produce most of the ionizing radiation @xcite . without direct observations to verify that the models are accurate , the fact that our lyc observations disagree with the models may indicate that there is something systematically incorrect with the model spectra at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , the tension between the models and our observations may be due to the uncertainties involved in removing contaminants .",
    "any low - redshift contaminants left in our sample ( e.g. , an [ oii]-emitter or foreground galaxy ) would also produce colors different from those predicted for models of @xmath88 galaxies .    here , we consider our inferred values of @xmath217 with respect to the model predictions of @xmath216 .",
    "we first discuss the interpretation of @xmath217 for samples of lbgs and laes with nb3420 detections because these are the samples for which lyc emission is actually measured .",

    "young ages for laes have been previously determined by sed fits of stacked photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that , once again , the correction for igm absorption may constitute an overcorrection , which would place the true value of @xmath217 for laes between 0.7 ( corrected for contamination and igm absorption ) and 1.6 ( corrected for contamination only ) .",

    "* ) limited to objects with near- or mid - infrared detections .",

    "these two values are consistent with the results of the survival analysis : laes with lyc detections are characterized by a smaller average ly@xmath2  ew than those without lyc detections .",
    "one explanation of the observed anticorrelation between ly@xmath2  ew and lyc emission strength consists of the fact that ly@xmath2  photons are simply reprocessed lyc photons .",
    "as a lyc photon propagates through the ism of a galaxy , one possibility is that the photon escapes without being absorbed by a neutral hydrogen atom , and lyc emission is observed from the galaxy .",
    "a second possibility is that the photon encounters a neutral hydrogen atom and is absorbed , ionizing the atom .",
    "when the free electron recombines with the hydrogen ion , the emission cascade spectrum will often culminate in the release of a ly@xmath2  photon .",
    "thus , for a fixed production rate of lyc photons , galaxies with larger ly@xmath2  ews should tend to exhibit less lyc emission .",
    "the fact that the stellar populations of galaxies with and without lyc detections do not appear to differ significantly ( see section [ ssec_ir ] ) suggests that detecting lyc in a given galaxy depends on the orientation of the galaxy with respect to the observer .",
    "if the hypothesis that lyc detectability depends on observer orientation is correct , then the anticorrelation between observed lyc and ly@xmath2  emission implies that ly@xmath2  ew must also depend on orientation , and in such a way to support the anticorrelation .",
    "results from several recent galaxy simulations ( of both isolated galaxies and those set in cosmological context ) suggest that the observed ly@xmath2  ew is strongly dependent on the orientation of the observer @xcite .",
    "specifically , these simulations predict orientation effects for disk galaxies : a disk galaxy , when viewed face - on , will have a much greater observed ly@xmath2  ew than the same galaxy viewed edge - on .",
    "this orientation effect stems from the fact that ly@xmath2  photons are resonantly scattered ; for a ly@xmath2  photon , the direction of final escape from the galaxy is nearly independent of its original trajectory . as trajectories perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy present the paths of least opacity",
    ", more ly@xmath2photons will escape perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "it is still unclear how the spatial redistribution of ly@xmath2photons relates to that of lyc photons , and how these distributions are affected by the clumpy morphologies of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "if , for example , ly@xmath2  and lyc photons are both more likely to escape along lines of sight with lower hydrogen column densities , a positive correlation between observed ly@xmath2  and lyc emission might be expected @xmath44 contrary to the anticorrelation observed in the lae populations of the hs1549 and ssa22a fields . in any case",
    ", it would be extremely useful for simulations to examine the effect that galaxy orientation produces on the relationship between observed ly@xmath2  and lyc emission .",
    "it would also be useful for such simulations to consider morphologies that more closely represent those of high - redshift galaxies ( i.e. , clumpy and irregular morphologies ; * ? ? ?",
    "if orientation effects _ can not _ explain the observed trend that smaller observed ly@xmath2  ews in laes coincide with more lyc emission , then the difference in ly@xmath2  ews must indicate some intrinsic difference between galaxies exhibiting strong or weak lyc emission that can be traced by ly@xmath2  emission . along these lines , we note that the mean rest - frame ly@xmath2  ew for laes without nb3420 detections ( 80   ) is close to that expected by the  case b \" assumption for 100% absorption of lyc photons in a dust - free environment ( @xmath30100   ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the presence of dust , the resonant scattering of ly@xmath2  photons would tend to decrease the expected  case b \" ly@xmath2  ew . if ly@xmath2orientation effects do not correlate with lyc in the manner described above , then the larger ly@xmath2  ews in our sample of laes without nb3420 detections indicates a higher rate of lyc absorption within the ism of these objects .    also relevant for understanding the connection between ly@xmath2  and lyc emission , we find a lower average non - ionizing to ionizing uv flux - density ratio among laes ( which have a median ly@xmath2  ew of 46  ) than among lbgs ( which have a much lower median ly@xmath2  ew of 5  ) .",
    "considering laes in the same magnitude range as lbgs ( @xmath323 ) , we derive @xmath324 which is significantly lower than the value for lbgs , @xmath325 .",
    "the relative values of @xmath217 for laes and lbgs apparently suggest a _ positive _ correlation between ly@xmath2  ew and lyc emission , in the opposite sense of the trend traced by the lyc vs. ly@xmath2  emission properties of laes .",
    "however , lbgs have been shown to differ from laes in several galactic properties , including dust content and gas / dust covering fraction .",
    "as dust destroys uv photons , and ly@xmath2  photons travel particularly long path lengths before they escape their galaxy due to resonant scattering , ly@xmath2  photons suffer greater dust attenuation than other uv photons .",
    "thus , while the amount of dust in a galaxy will not affect the creation of ly@xmath2  photons from lyc photons , it will affect the observed ly@xmath2  ew .",
    "observational studies have confirmed that lbgs with larger ly@xmath2  ews have smaller values of @xmath247 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulations have reproduced the same result ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , lbgs with larger ly@xmath2  ews have weaker interstellar absorption lines , indicating lower gas covering fraction @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the low median ly@xmath2  ew observed in lbgs compared to laes is due to increased dust attenuation ( lbgs have median values of @xmath247 that are typically higher than those of laes ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and larger gas covering fraction . in summary ,",
    "the observed strengths of ly@xmath2  and lyc emission may be anti - correlated ( as seen in the lae sample ) except in the cases of higher interstellar extinction where ly@xmath2  photons are systematically destroyed ( as in the case of the lbgs ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the @xmath21 lyc properties of the hs1549 field .",
    "multiple lyc studies of star - forming galaxies have been conducted in the ssa22a field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hs1549 therefore provides an important independent set of @xmath21 lyc measurements .",
    "the hs1549 field contains a galaxy protocluster at @xmath37 , and our narrowband ( nb3420 ) imaging has targeted the lyc spectral region of 131 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath38 ( 49 lbgs and 91 laes , 9 of which are constituents of both samples ) .",
    "we have detected 12 galaxies in nb3420 and implemented simulations to correct the average nb3420 magnitudes of subsamples of these galaxies for both foreground galaxy contamination and absorption from neutral hydrogren in the igm .",
    "in addition to more than 19 hours of imaging in the nb3420 filter , we have analyzed ancillary narrowband ly@xmath2  imaging and broadband imaging in the rest - frame non - ionizing uv , optical , and near - infrared in order to determine non - ionizing to ionizing uv flux - density ratios and place limits on other galactic properties .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "we find 4 lbgs and 7 laes with nb3420 detections , along with one additional object ( md12/_lae3540 _ ) that we have removed from both samples .",
    "the nb3420 detections of the lbgs range in magnitude from @xmath326 and those of the laes range from @xmath327 .",
    "our contamination simulations predict that 1.5 @xmath114 1.0 lbg nb3420 detections and 4.3 @xmath114 1.3 lae nb3420 detections are uncontaminated by foreground galaxies",
    "the ratio of non - ionizing to ionizing uv radiation of the lbgs and laes is traced by the observed nb3420@xmath4 color .",
    "the colors of our targets vary widely , with nb3420-detected galaxies at a given @xmath3 magnitude having nb3420 magnitudes up to a factor of ten brighter than the nb3420 limits of undetected galaxies ; i.e. , a small percentage of galaxies are detected strongly in nb3420 and the rest remain undetected .",
    "these results confirm those presented in @xcite for galaxies in the ssa22a field , and lend further support to the hypothesis that lyc radiation escapes galaxies through cleared holes in the ism and can only be viewed by the observer with fortuitous orientation .",
    "the large variation in individual galaxy nb3420 properties makes it necessary to consider properties of the full ensemble of lbgs and laes in order to determine the average lyc properties of @xmath32 galaxies .",
    "one of the principal difficulties in performing accurate lyc photometry is the presence of low - redshift foreground galaxies that introduce contaminating light into the nb3420 filter . at the spatial resolution of @xmath18 ,",
    "galaxies at @xmath21 tend to exhibit clumpy morphology . separating a @xmath21 clump from a foreground contaminant is impossible unless the individual redshifts of each clump are known .",
    "while simulations of the amount of foreground contamination can help correct the observed non - ionizing to ionizing uv flux - density ratios , it is very difficult to study the properties of lyc - emitting galaxies when the simulations predict that roughly half of the nb3420-detected sample may be contaminated . to obtain spectroscopic or photometric redshifts at the high spatial resolution necessary to distinguish each clump requires imaging from a high - resolution , space - based observing facility such as @xmath18 coupled with deep , high - resolution spectroscopy from the ground .",
    "reconciling the low observed non - ionizing to ionizing uv flux - density ratios ( @xmath182 ) with intrinsic values predicted by stellar population synthesis models has been a challenge in all @xmath32 lyc studies . as in the ssa22a field ,",
    "the observed flux - density ratios of many of the lbgs and laes with putative lyc detections are too low to be reasonably explained by current models .",
    "there are possible ways of solving the problem ; for example , one could make the assumption of no igm absorption along the line of sight for galaxies with observed lyc detections .",
    "however , this condition is unlikely to hold for all galaxies with putative lyc detections . as of now",
    ", the discrepancy between the lyc observations and models remains unresolved .",
    "5 .   using estimates of the uv escape fraction from observational studies of @xmath32 galaxies and a range of estimated values for the theoretical ratio of intrinsic uv to lyc luminosities given by the @xcite and bpass @xcite models , we derive relative lyc escape fractions of @xmath8% and @xmath9% , and absolute escape fractions of @xmath10% and @xmath11% .",
    "the uncertainties on the escape fractions we calculate are on the order of 50% .",
    "we also determine a comoving specific ionizing emissivity of lyc photons ( @xmath269 ) in the range of 8.8 @xmath44 15.0 @xmath328 ergs s@xmath36 hz@xmath36 mpc@xmath283 .",
    "this range of emissivity values was determined by using two different models to combine the lbg and lae samples ( as discussed in section [ ssec_lyc_emissivity ] ) ; the luminosity - dependent model yields @xmath282 ergs s@xmath36 hz@xmath36 mpc@xmath283 and the lae - dependent model yields @xmath284 ergs s@xmath36 hz@xmath36 mpc@xmath283 .",
    "these values of @xmath269 for star - forming galaxies are consistent with the total ionizing emissivity inferred from the ly@xmath2-forest studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rough agreement between the total ionizing emissivity and the ionizing emissivity from star - forming galaxies leaves little room for the contribution to the emissivity from qsos or from fainter star - forming galaxies not probed by our observations . while the lyc emissivity we measure from star - forming galaxies may still be an overestimation , it is in better agreement with the total lyc emissivity determined from ly@xmath2-forest studies than the higher values determined in past work .",
    "6 .   examining the rest - frame near - infrared properties of galaxies in our sample based on irac _",
    "ch2 _ imaging",
    ", we find no significant difference in the _ ch2 _ or @xmath60__ch2 _ _ properties of objects with and without nb3420 detections .",
    "this agreement indicates that objects with and without lyc detections are drawn from a populations of star - forming galaxies with similar distributions of stellar mass , age , @xmath247 , and star - formation rate .",
    "we caution , however , that our interpretation is limited by the fact that only one galaxy ( md34 ) with an nb3420 detection is detected in _ ch2_.",
    "while the @xmath60__ch2 _ _ vs. @xmath3 properties of this object do not distinguish it from lbgs without nb3420 detections , in the sed modeling , it has been assigned the lowest possible age allowed and the second largest sfr of the 33 modeled lbgs . a much larger sample of lbgs with both lyc detections and irac photometry is needed to test whether lbgs with lyc detections are preferentially young , or whether lbgs with and without lyc detections come from similar populations . 7 .",
    "while we do not find significant differences in the stellar populations of objects with and without lyc detection , we do find that laes with lyc detections have smaller ly@xmath2  equivalent widths on average than those without .",
    "a comparison of @xmath217 for laes in two bins of equivalent width yields @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "these results imply an inverse relationship between the amount of ly@xmath2  and lyc emission observed from laes .",
    "one possibility is that this relationship stems from the fact that ly@xmath2  photons are reprocessed lyc photons , so an overall increase in ly@xmath2  photons must correlate with a decrease in lyc photons .",
    "the details of lyc and ly@xmath2  radiative transfer through the ism of clumpy , high - redshift galaxies , however , are still unclear , as are the effects of varying the observer s orientation while observing ly@xmath2and lyc emission .",
    "we also note that despite this apparent anti - correlation between the strength of ly@xmath2  and lyc emission , lbgs ( which have lower median ly@xmath2  equivalent widths than laes ) display much weaker lyc emission than laes in the same magnitude range .",
    "this trend may be explained by the higher dust content in lbgs systematically destroying both lyc photons and resonantly - scattered ly@xmath2  photons .",
    "future progress in this field is contingent upon amassing a large and well - defined sample of lyc - emitting star - forming galaxies and eradicating the possibility that lyc measurements are contaminated by foreground interlopers .",
    "a detailed , multi - wavelength analysis of such a sample would reveal definitively whether lyc - emitting objects possess specific properties that facilitate lyc escape or whether lyc emission escapes from all galaxies through randomly - oriented paths cleared through the ism . with the goals of removing contamination and obtaining multiwavelength photometry",
    ", we are currently pursuing follow - up observations of our nb3420-detected galaxies in the hs1549 field with @xmath18/wfc3 .",

    "<S> we present results from a survey for @xmath0 lyman - continuum ( lyc ) emission in the hs1549 + 1933 field and place constraints on the amount of ionizing radiation escaping from star - forming galaxies . using a custom narrowband filter ( nb3420 ) </S>",
    "<S> tuned to wavelengths just below the lyman limit at @xmath1 , we probe the lyc spectral region of 49 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and 91 ly@xmath2-emitters ( laes ) spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> four lbgs and seven laes are detected in nb3420 . using @xmath3-band data probing the rest - frame non - ionizing uv , we observe that many nb3420-detected galaxies exhibit spatial offsets between their lyc and non - ionizing uv emission and are characterized by extremely blue nb3420@xmath4 colors , corresponding to low ratios of non - ionizing to ionizing radiation @xmath5 that are in tension with current stellar population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> we measure average values of @xmath5 for our lbg and lae samples , correcting for foreground galaxy contamination and hi absorption in the igm . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these flux - density ratios correspond respectively to relative lyc escape fractions of @xmath8% and @xmath9% , absolute lyc escape fractions of @xmath10% and @xmath11% , and a comoving lyc emissivity from star - forming galaxies of @xmath12 . in order to study the differential properties of galaxies with and without lyc detections , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze narrowband ly@xmath2  imaging and rest - frame near - infrared imaging , finding that while laes with lyc detections have lower ly@xmath2  equivalent widths on average , there is no substantial difference in the rest - frame near - infrared colors of lbgs or laes with and without lyc detections . </S>",
    "<S> these preliminary results are consistent with an orientation - dependent model where lyc emission escapes through cleared paths in a patchy ism . </S>"
