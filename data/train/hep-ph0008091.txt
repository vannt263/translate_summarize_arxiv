    "the nrqcd factorization formalism provides a systematic framework for analyzing the inclusive production of heavy quarkonium @xcite .",
    "long - distance effects involving the binding of a heavy quark - antiquark pair into quarkonium are factored into parameters called nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "these nonperturbative parameters are universal , so values extracted from one high energy physics experiment can be used to predict the production rate in others .",
    "the nrqcd matrix elements scale as definite powers of @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the typical relative velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the nrqcd factorization approach becomes phenomenologically useful upon truncating the expansion in @xmath11 so as to reduce the independent nrqcd matrix elements to a manageable number .",
    "the truncation is most reliable for the heaviest quarkonium states , namely the @xmath12 system for which @xmath13 is roughly 1/10 .",
    "the most abundant source of data on bottomonium production is the tevatron @xmath0 collider . in run",
    "ia of the tevatron , the cdf collaboration was able to resolve the individual s - wave bottomonium states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and measure their production cross sections @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the cdf data within the nrqcd factorization formalism was carried out by cho and leibovich @xcite .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the production of p - wave bottomonium states that subsequently make transitions to s - wave states .",
    "cho and leibovich found that the cdf data was insufficient to determine all the important nrqcd matrix elements and they had to make educated guesses for some of them .",
    "the cdf collaboration has recently analyzed the data on bottomonium production from run ib at the tevatron .",
    "in addition to much higher statistics on the cross sections for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xcite , they also have results on the production of the p - wave states @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the high quality of the new cdf data justifies an updated theoretical analysis , with careful attention to the experimental and theoretical errors .    in this paper",
    ", we present a quantitative analysis of the new cdf data on bottomonium production within the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "the color - singlet nrqcd matrix elements for s - wave states are determined from their electromagnetic decays , while those for p - wave states are estimated from potential models .",
    "the color - octet nrqcd matrix elements are determined by fitting the cdf data , taking full account of the feeddown from transitions between bottomonium states .",
    "the resulting values of the matrix elements are used to predict the cross sections for the spin - triplet and spin - singlet bottomonium states in run ii of the tevatron .",

    "the @xmath12 cross sections , which are independent of the bottomonium state @xmath14 , can be calculated using perturbative qcd .",
    "all dependence on the state @xmath14 is factored into parameters @xmath17 called _ nrqcd matrix elements_. these phenomenological parameters can be expressed as matrix elements in an effective field theory called nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) .",
    "a nonperturbative analysis of nrqcd reveals how the various matrix elements scale with the typical relative velocity @xmath11 of the heavy quark in quarkonium .",
    "spin symmetry , which is an approximate symmetry of qcd , also gives relations between various matrix elements .",
    "the relative importance of the terms in the factorization formula ( [ sig - nrqcd ] ) depends on the size of the @xmath12 cross sections and on the size of the matrix elements . according to the velocity - scaling rules ,",

    "the measured inclusive @xmath1 cross section at central rapidity integrated over all @xmath4 up to 20 gev satisfies @xmath49 pb , where @xmath50 is the branching fraction of @xmath1 into @xmath51 . the cross section integrated only over @xmath52 gev satisfies @xmath53 pb . the ratio of these cross sections is @xmath54 . multiplying the inclusive @xmath1 cross section @xmath55 nb by the factor of 6.5 to take into account the small @xmath4 region and by the ratio 4.3 from table  [ tab : rincl ] , we find that the cross section for @xmath9 integrated over all @xmath4 should be approximately @xmath56 nb .",
    "the cross section for @xmath9 indicates that this state must have been produced in abundance in run i of the tevatron .",
    "however the @xmath9 can be observed only if it has a large enough branching fraction into a decay mode that can be triggered upon .",
    "one possibility is the double-@xmath57 decay @xmath58 , followed by the decays @xmath59 .",
    "the decay @xmath58 has essentially the same kinematics as the decay @xmath60 , except that all masses are scaled up by a factor of 3 .",
    "thus the branching fraction for @xmath58 could be as large as that for @xmath60 , which is approximately @xmath61 .",
    "we can obtain a lower bound on the branching fraction by using the fact that in the limit @xmath62 with @xmath63 fixed , the branching fraction for @xmath58 scales like @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath63 and @xmath65 were both in this scaling region , then the branching fraction into light @xmath66 mesons would be smaller for @xmath9 than for @xmath67 by a factor of @xmath68 , which is about @xmath69 . since we are not deep into this scaling region , the suppression should be smaller than this .",
    "thus the branching fraction for @xmath58 should be in the range between @xmath70 and @xmath61 . multiplying by the branching fractions of 6% for each of the decays",
    "@xmath59 , our estimate for the branching fraction for @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "the cross section for producing this particular decay mode of @xmath9 is therefore @xmath73 pb , give or take a factor of 10 .",
    "multiplying by the rapidity interval 0.8 and by the integrated luminosity of about 100 pb@xmath74 in run i of the tevatron , we obtain between 16 and 1600 produced events .",
    "we must also take into account the acceptances and efficiencies for observing the decays @xmath59 .",
    "these can be estimated using the cdf data on the production of prompt @xmath57 in run ia of the tevatron @xcite .",
    "based on the observation of about 22,000 @xmath59 candidates with @xmath75 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath76 in a 15 pb@xmath74 data sample , they measured the cross section in that region of @xmath4 and @xmath77 to be @xmath78 nb .",
    "we infer that the product of the acceptance and the efficiency is roughly @xmath79 . multiplying the number of events that are produced by @xmath80",
    ", we get between 0.13 and 13 observed events . thus this cross section may be large enough to be observed in run i of the tevatron . in run",
    "ii , the integrated luminosity will be larger by a factor of 20 and there will be significant improvements in the acceptances and efficiencies for observing muons in both the cdf and d0 detectors .",
    "thus the @xmath9 should certainly be observed in run ii through the decay @xmath10 .",
    "we have carried out an updated nrqcd analysis of the cdf data on the production of spin - triplet bottomonium states from run i of the tevatron . in spite of using only the data from @xmath52 gev",
    ", we were able to extract all the relevant color - octet matrix elements directly from the data .",
    "only one of the 8 color - octet matrix elements comes out with a negative central value , but several others are also consistent with zero to within errors . in our analysis",
    ", we distinguished between the inclusive color - octet matrix elements that can be used to compute inclusive @xmath22 cross sections and the direct color - octet matrix elements required to compute direct @xmath22 cross sections and , by spin symmetry , direct @xmath7 cross sections .",
    "the most serious deficiency in our analysis was our failure to take into account the effects of soft - gluon radiation that are needed to give a smooth @xmath4 distribution at small @xmath4 .",
    "this forced us to use only the small fraction of the data from @xmath52 gev to fit the color - octet matrix elements , which led to large errors in these matrix elements .",
    "if these matrix elements are used to predict bottomonium cross sections in other high energy processes , the predictions will probably have large error bars .",
    "our theoretical cross sections also diverge from the cdf data below @xmath81 gev , which gives us another reason to be cautious in applying our matrix elements to other high energy processes .",
    "an analysis that deals properly with the small @xmath4 region could take full advantage of the cdf data and therefore determine the color - octet matrix elements more accurately .",
    "such an analysis requires a prescription for combining the leading - order cross sections for @xmath82 with the next - to - leading order cross sections for @xmath83 recently calculated by petrelli et al .",
    "@xcite to get a smooth @xmath4 distribution near @xmath84 .",
    "the matrix elements extracted from such an analysis should give reliable predictions for observables at the tevatron that are dominated by low @xmath4 .",
    "they should also give reliable predictions for bottomonium production in other high energy processes .",
    "our analysis should give reliable predictions for the cross sections of the spin - singlet states @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the tevatron .",
    "we find that the direct cross section for @xmath9 at @xmath52 gev should be greater than the inclusive cross section for @xmath1 by a factor of about 4.3 .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath4 distributions have the same shapes at smaller @xmath4 , we can estimate the cross section for @xmath9 integrated over all @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting cross section is large enough that it should be possible to discover the @xmath9 at the tevatron if there is a decay mode with a large enough branching fraction that can be used as a trigger .",
    "we argued that the decay @xmath10 should allow the discovery of the @xmath9 , if not in the data from run i , then certainly in run ii of the tevatron .",
