    "luminous blue variables are the most massive stars at one of the final stages of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "a small number of massive stars in the galaxies and a very short scale of the lbv phase ( @xmath10 years ) makes these objects unique .",
    "the study of lbv - type stars is essential for understanding the evolution of stars on the upper part of the main sequence , the formation of wr stars , supernovae , relativistic stars ( black holes ) , for the comprehension of the mechanisms of mass loss , and heavy - element enrichment in galaxies .",
    "it is believed that the stars with more than 40m@xmath6 undergo the lbv phase @xcite .",
    "however , the relationship between the lbv stars and other types of massive stars at the final stages of evolution ( red supergiants rsg , yellow supergiants ysg , blue supergiants bsg , b[e]-supergiants , wr stars ) , and evolutionary transitions between these types of stars are still unclear @xcite .",
    "lbv stars are closely linked with the late wr stars of the nitrogen sequence with hydrogen in their atmospheres ( wnlh ) .",
    "two cases of transition are known from observations : lbv @xmath11 wnlh ( star v532 in m33 , @xcite ) and wn3 @xmath11 wn11(lbv ) @xmath11 wn4/5 ( star hd5980 in the smc galaxy , @xcite ) .",
    "observational manifestations of lbv stars are very diverse @xcite , and the number of known objects of this type is little .",
    "it is hence not clear whether the lbv class of objects is homogeneous .",
    "for example , why have the sdor variables @xcite not revealed giant eruptions , similar to the @xmath12 car and pcyg stars .",
    "it is also difficult to draw specific conclusions about the place of the lbv phase in the evolution of massive stars , and even more so about the effects of binarity and rapid rotation at this stage of evolution .",
    "it is obvious that the above problems can only be solved when a sufficiently large number of objects is thoroughly studied",
    ". observations of more lbv - like stars increases our chances to witness the rare transitions .",
    "this will allow testing the modern evolutionary sequences and the dependence of various stages of massive star evolution on galactic metallicity ( z ) .",
    "apparently , most of the lbv stars without notable interstellar extinction in our galaxy are already discovered .",
    "however , it is probably still possible to discover a few dozen more such objects in the galaxy using modern infrared in the m33 galaxy almost all the lbv - like objects may be detected , as its fortunate orientation ( its inclination to the line of sight is 56 ) , and a relatively close distance allow detailed spectroscopy of its bright stars .",
    "the review @xcite attributes five and 15 stars to the confirmed members of the lbv class in our galaxy and in the galaxies of the local group , respectively .",
    "in particular , in the m33 galaxy the authors identified four lbv stars .",
    "clark et al .",
    "@xcite mention 12 lbv stars and 23 lbv candidates in our galaxy , while in the m33 galaxy 37 lbv candidates are known    according to the catalog @xcite , m33 contains 2304 stellar objects with v<185 .",
    "if we assume that the mean interstellar extinction of the brightest stars in the galaxy is a@xmath1310 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , where this value is estimated as a@xmath13095@xmath14005 ) , then with the distance modulus to m33 of the stars with v<185 and @xmath15<035 will have the luminosity m@xmath1674 and color in @xcite we made photometry in the  @xmath0   images of all the stars from the catalog @xcite with the above restrictions on color and luminosity , and made a list of stars with an excess in @xmath0 .",
    "these are bright supergiants of the iab luminosity class and brighter , and the hottest ib supergiants ( with b0 spectra and earlier ) @xcite .",
    "we expected that all the potential lbv candidates will make it into our list .",
    "we hence isolated in @xcite 185 blue emission objects ( v<185 and candidates for massive stars at the final stages of evolution .",
    "evidently , lbvs and similar objects may well have the extinction a@xmath17 > 10 , for which reason an _ additional list _ of stars with v<185 and with emission in @xmath0   was made in @xcite , containing 25 candidates .",
    "we currently make spectroscopic observations of objects from both our lists @xcite . in the first list we discovered an lbv - type star n93351 , which is located in the nuclear region of m33 @xcite .",
    "two objects from our supplementary list ( presumably with a notable own reddening ) were earlier as hot lbv candidates : n6862 with @xmath18 052 and n141751 with @xmath18 077 .",
    "we have recently obtained spectra of 15 candidate stars from the supplementary list , among them we discovered two new lbv candidates . in this paper",
    "we present the results of study of these two objects .",
    "the spectra of two new lbv candidates , n45901 and n125093 were obtained on the 6-m bta telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) with the scorpio focal reducer .",
    "table [ table : obs ] presents the log of observations . during the observations we used the slit width of 1 , its orientation is shown in fig .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    the data processing was performed in a standard way .",
    "after the spectra were cleaned for traces of cosmic particles , the following reduction procedures were completed : correction for the level of the electronic zero ( bias ) , for flat field , wavelength calibration based on the spectrum of a near lamp , correction for spectral sensitivity of the ccd , and reduction to fluxes in energy units .",

    "before refining the temperatures and luminosities of these stars in their energy distributions , we estimate their interstellar reddening .",
    "it follows from the spectra that the temperatures of the photospheres of these stars are above 10000k . for the supergiants",
    "this temperature corresponds to at the bolometric correction the observed colors of the stars are equal to for n45901 and for n125093 .",
    "therefore , their values of interstellar reddening are not below and 2.6 , respectively . at the distance modulus to m33 we adopted as equal to , we find the lower limit of n45901 luminosity as and for n125093",
    ".    to construct the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , we used the data of optical and infrared photometry from table[table : lbvphot ] .",
    "we applied a blackbody approximation for individual components : a hot star and one or two components of dust emission .",
    "the upper limit of the temperature of the warm dust component was set at 1500  k , since above this temperature the dust begins to evaporate .    without the a priori information on temperature and reddening",
    "it is not possible to determine these two parameters independently . for the object n125093",
    ", we have both a preliminary estimate of the stellar temperature , and the reddening ( ) . for n45901",
    ", we only have an evaluation of the stellar photosphere temperature . indeed , the spectra of both our stars are very similar ( fig.[figure : spectra ] ) , hence , their temperatures should not differ greatly either .",
    "the seds are demonstrated in fig.[figure : seds ] . the radiation intensity drop in the u - band",
    "is associated with the presence of the balmer jump in these stars .",
    "the magnitude of fading in the u - band is about the same for both stars .",
    "this independently confirms our conclusion that the temperatures of both stars are almost identical .",
    "we have not used the measurements obtained in the u - band at the fits .",
    "we assume that the photometric measurements in the r , i ( and , possibly , j - bands ) may be distorted by an additional contribution of the free - free wind radiation @xcite .",
    "however , the result of approximations shows that the contribution of this emission in the two stars is negligible .",
    "the luminosity of each sed component was calculated as the area under the corresponding blackbody spectrum , and the bolometric luminosity of the object was deduced as the sum of luminosities of the components .",
    "the best solutions for these stars are listed in table [ table : lbvparam ] .",
    "the photometric data ( not corrected for reddening ) are marked with crosses in fig .",

    "the solid lines represent individual blackbody components ( three for n125093 , and two for n45901 ) , as well as the sum of all components .    for n125093",
    "we find the optimal value of the interstellar extinction as it is close to the assessment we obtained from the spectra of the surrounding hii emission ( a@xmath19 ) .",
    "the stellar parameters obtained for the limiting values of a@xmath17=2.6 and a@xmath17=2.9 are listed in table[table : lbvparam ] .",
    "the temperature of the stellar photosphere is which is consistent with our estimate from the spectrum .",
    "the corresponding bolometric luminosity of n125093 amounts to @xmath5(l / l@xmath6 ) = 6.3  6.6 .",
    "we find two thermal components in the spectrum , a warm component with and a cold component with the infrared excess in n125093 is 56% of the bolometric luminosity .    in the case of n45901 we deduced the optimal estimate of interstellar extinction at a@xmath3 .",
    "accordingly , the temperature of the photosphere of n45901 is estimated as and its bolometric luminosity amounts to infrared excess in n45901 corresponds to the warm dust radiation with the temperature of and amounts to 0.1% of the bolometric luminosity .     and",

    "we show there our two new candidates n45901 and n125093 , and the evolutional tracks @xcite , computed for the stars with metallicity 0.007 , corresponding to m33 . the temperatures and luminosities of these stars were deduced by a unified method of approximation of the seds engaging additional data on the temperatures of stars and interstellar extinction values , obtained from the spectra . for the majority of stars the boundary values of temperature are shown , which have met the approximation of spectral energy distributions . in the case of stars var83 , vara , and n93351 , the parameters of the two boundary values of interstellar extinction are indicated , hence the range of valid parameters ( l , t ) forms a closed region .    from this diagram , we find the mass estimates for the stars on the zams .",
    "the masses of n45901 and n125093 are estimated as approximately and respectively .",
    "luminous blue variables are characterized by a strong and diverse brightness a large amplitude variability ( over 1@xmath21 ) is rare in the classical lbvs , such events may take place on the time scales of dozens of years .",
    "for example , an lbv prototype pcyg , having demonstrated a giant eruption , possesses a relatively stable brightness over the past three centuries .",
    "in fact , any new object candidate for the lbv will remain only an `` lbv candidate '' until its brightness variability reaches a large amplitude ( presumably not less than 0.30.5 magnitude , as the amplitudes of 0.10.2 magnitude is common for massive supergiants ) .",
    "tens and hundreds of years may pass while we wait for a strong manifestation of brightness variability .",
    "regardless of the spectrum , temperature , or luminosity , irrespective of which `` typical lbv '' features are found in one or another lbv candidate , such an object will remain only a candidate .",

    "there will be found more reliable criteria and classifications of the lbv class and this stage of massive star evolution in general .",
    "the chemical composition of the atmosphere , i.e. the relative hydrogen and helium abundance is likely to be such a reliable criterion .",

    "see the introduction ) , which reveal a low abundance of hydrogen in the wind is well - known .",
    "it is obvious that the understanding of physics and evolutionary status of the lbv objects requires detecting large numbers of objects bearing properties similar to lbv .",
