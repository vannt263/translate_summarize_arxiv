    "because of their chemical structure , when one adds amphiphilic molecules in an aqueous substance they spontaneously form membrane structures known as micelles of various geometrical shapes ( spherical or cylindrical in particular ) .",
    "the relevance of these structures , in part , is that they can be regarded as simplified models of biological molecules and , that they can actually be created artificially in the laboratory for its use in cosmetics and detergents @xcite . despite the diversity of these amphiphilic membranes",
    ", they can be modeled by a single geometric hamiltonian that captures their relevant physical properties as the surface tension @xmath3 and rigidity @xmath4 . for the last ,",
    "a term that penalizes the energetic cost of giving curvature to the membrane has been suggested @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , geometric hamiltonians of this sort of surfaces appear in several areas of physics ranging from string theory and cosmology to condensed matter @xcite .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the membrane configurations satisfy the euler - lagrange equations which are obtained by extremizing the hamiltonian respect to the membrane orthogonal deformations .",
    "these equations are essentially geometric in its own nature .",
    "the evaluation of the second variation of the hamiltonian is necessary to study the stability of equilibrium solutions and to understand the effect of fluctuations on the shape of the membrane .",
    "if one wishes to understand , for instance , the transitions between different shapes that the membrane can have , one has to study the effect of small fluctuations on the membrane shape .",
    "a problem in statistical physics , in this context , is to study the membrane elasticity under thermal fluctuations ; i.e. to investigate the effect of such fluctuations on the bending constants ; the membrane rigidity in particular @xcite .",
    "this problem has already been considered by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the conclusion they reach is that thermal fluctuations soften the membrane . for a quasi - two - dimensional membrane",
    "there exists a non - trivial fixed point @xmath5 : a membrane with temperature lower than @xmath6 is very rigid at long length scales , but one with temperature greater than @xmath6 has very low rigidity ( becoming zero for length scales beyond a characteristic length called the persistence length ) . for exactly two - dimensional membranes , which is the critical dimension of the model",
    ", it can be interpreted that the membrane disappears as a consequence of fluctuations .",
    "this is similar to what occurs in the @xmath7 non - linear sigma model where , in two dimensions , fluctuations destroy any attempt of ordering .",
    "recently , however , it has been suggested that thermal fluctuations rather stiffen the membrane @xcite instead of softening it .",
    "the interpretation of this result is not clear yet .",
    "so , because of this , we have consider it useful to investigate the subject using an alternative approach .    in principle , there are two different approaches which allow one to study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the membrane .",
    "one of them ; the one we use here , consists of a perturbative expansion for finite @xmath8 codimension with the inverse of the rigidity @xmath9 ( @xmath10 the temperature ) being the perturbative parameter .",
    "our results indicate that thermal fluctuations lower the value of the rigidity , so the model falls into the two - dimensional membrane scenario described above .",
    "the other approach consists of a non - perturbative approximation in @xmath8 within the @xmath11 limit @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by analogy with the @xmath7 nonlinear sigma model , the non - perturbative @xmath11 limit approximation must somehow regain the properties of a two - dimensional membrane in a three - dimensional euclidean space within the one - loop approximation .",
    "in particular , the one - loop result for the membrane rigidity of codimension @xmath8 is exact within the @xmath11 limit @xcite .",
    "this rises the question whether this is still valid to order two - loops .",
    "the approach we propose in this article may , amongst other things , give an answer to this question or it can help to understand , for instance , the effect of quantum fluctuations in geometric models from string theory as those proposing the rigidity term as fundamental for their description @xcite .    to be explicit , the work in this article consists in obtaining , in the one - loop order , the elastic bendings for a @xmath0-dimensional membrane embedded into a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "though it is possible to generalize for higher dimensional membranes , we consider this the most relevant case .",
    "the calculation of the elastic bendings , to this order , starts by determining the operator of fluctuations associated with small deformations in the shape of the membrane .",
    "a common approach for that is to consider the monge representation where the hamiltonian is expanded in terms of the membrane height , @xmath12 . beyond the gaussian model , perturbation theory yields autointeraction terms extremely difficult to deal with .",
    "it is important to realise , however , that carrying out a perturbative expansion can be advantageous indeed as it accounts for the crumpling transition @xcite .",
    "there is the disadvantage , though , of loosing covariance in the expressions appearing at intermediate calculations .",
    "for this investigation we use an alternative formalism , capable of dealing with geometric models such as the helfrich model for fluid membranes , which does preserve covariance in all expressions .",
    "this formalism has been extensively used before by capovilla and guven @xcite , and is found particularly powerful in simplifying long calculations . as an example , within this formalism the euler - lagrange equations can be obtained in a few lines from a geometric hamiltonian . moreover ,",
    "this fully covariant approach allows one to solve several technically difficult problems such as the description of lipid membranes with an edge and to tackle the problem of membrane adhesion @xcite .",
    "in addition to those , it has recently been used to investigate thermal fluctuations of fluid membranes in higher dimensions . as a result ,",
    "the operator of fluctuations @xmath13 for a @xmath14-dimensional membrane embedded into an euclidean space of dimension @xmath15 has been found in a systematic manner @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian associated with the model under study is written as a sum of three terms : the first one is quadratic in the mean extrinsic curvature , @xmath16 .",
    "the second one is proportional to the scalar curvature of the membrane @xmath17 , and the last one proportional to its area @xmath18 , @xmath19 given that @xmath20=l^{-1}$ ] , any other terms of higher order in the curvature are irrelevant for two - dimensional membranes in the long - length regime .",
    "this @xmath21 above is a generalized model of a lipid membrane with non - zero rigidity and surface tension which has also been studied in the string theory context @xcite .",
    "the model is invariant under translations and rotations in space .",
    "the partition function @xmath22 is constructed as a functional integral over all possible surface configurations , @xmath23 , of the form @xmath24 where @xmath10 is the temperature parameter . in the one - loop order",
    ", we expand up to second order the exponent in equation ( [ partition ] ) around a configuration extremizing @xmath21 .",
    "notice that , as discussed in reference @xcite , even in the one - loop order the integral measure contributes with a non - linear factor ( a sort of liouville term ) that has to be taken into account . leaving this for later consideration and after computing a gaussian integral , the one - loop effective hamiltonian may be formally written as @xmath25 with @xmath13 the operator for small fluctuations and tr representing the functional trace .",
    "subsequently , we obtain the one - loop effective bending coefficients of the model and present the results below . as it will be shown , they are in agreement with those obtained for the case of a two - dimensional membrane embedded into a three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "as the fundamental tool used throughout this work is essentially geometry , we describe in section [ goes ] the geometry of embedded surfaces . in section [ ditg ]",
    "we study deformations in the quantities present in the hamiltonian .",
    "further , the euler - lagrange equations of the problem are also written here . in section [ sod ]",
    "we present the operator of fluctuations for the hamiltonian and in section [ ker ] we obtain the one - loop effective parameters .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section [ s ] .",
    "an orientable @xmath14-dimensional surface @xmath26 , embedded into the @xmath15-dimensional euclidean space @xmath27 , is locally specified by the embedding functions , @xmath28 where @xmath29 are @xmath15 functions of @xmath14 variables each .",
    "the metric @xmath30 , induced on @xmath26 , is defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and we are using the inner product in @xmath27 .",
    "this metric @xmath30 determines the intrinsic geometry of @xmath26 .    the riemann curvature @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the covariant derivative associated to @xmath30 .",
    "the ricci tensor is defined by @xmath37 and the scalar curvature given by @xmath38 .",
    "let us now examine the extrinsic geometry of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath8 unit vectors @xmath39 , normal to @xmath26 in @xmath27 , are defined implicitly by @xmath40 which , after normalization , satisfy @xmath41 notice that these equations determine the normals @xmath42 up to an arbitrary rotation .",
    "therefore , the definition is invariant under local rotations , @xmath43 the set of vectors @xmath44 is precisely an adapted base on the surface .",
    "their gradients along the surface are written in terms of this base as the gauss - weingarten equations @xmath45 the extrinsic curvatures of @xmath26 are given by the @xmath8 symmetric rank - two surface tensors , @xmath46 .",
    "we also define the trace with respect to the induced metric , @xmath47 both the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of @xmath26 , which are determined by @xmath30 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , can no longer be specified independently .",
    "they are related by integrability conditions that correspond to generalized gauss - codazzi and codazzi - mainardi equations , and also by equations that fix the curvature @xmath50 associated with the @xmath51 connection @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 : @xmath54 in these expressions @xmath55 is the @xmath51 covariant derivative defined as @xmath56",
    "we proceed as in the hypersurface case and project the deformation onto its normal and tangent components in the form @xcite @xmath57 by now we will assume that the surface has no boundary so that the tangent deformation can be associated to a reparametrization . the only physical deformations are those normal to the surface .",
    "let us then examine the deformation in the adapted base @xmath58 under these normal deformations .",
    "therefore , the relationships @xmath59 hold . in those we have used the covariant derivative @xmath60 defined in equation ( [ gcd ] ) . by using equation ( [ a ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the deformation in the induced metric is given by @xmath61 from this , we get the first order deformation of the infinitesimal area element @xmath62 let us now turn to the first order deformation of the extrinsic curvature along the @xmath63 normal vector . for that we find @xmath64 as a result , the deformation in the mean extrinsic curvature is @xmath65 from these expressions it is straightforward to find the corresponding euler - lagrange equations of the model ( @xmath66 ) , which are given by @xcite @xmath67      to second order we express the result in terms of the deformations already in hand .",
    "therefore , given the hamiltonian in equation ( [ elfrich ] ) , we find that the operator of fluctuations can be written in the compact form @xmath68 with the coefficient of the laplacian term given by @xmath69 @xmath70 where the definitions @xmath71 have been used . both coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 contain @xmath74 and @xmath75 terms respectively @xcite ; which will modify , in any case , terms of higher order in the membrane curvature .",
    "these , however , have not been taken into account in the hamiltonian because they are irrelevant for long - length scales for two - dimensional membranes .",
    "the heat kernel provides a covariant method for calculating the short distance behaviour of the effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "one examines the heat equation associated with the laplacian on the surface .",
    "its kernel satisfies @xmath76 subject to the initial condition @xmath77 the solution to this equation can be written in the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the world function ( equal to half the squared geodesic distance between the points @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 the van vleck - morette determinant . in the @xmath83 limit",
    ", the exponential normalized by @xmath84 reduces to the delta function .",
    "we thus have that @xmath85 is a regular function of its arguments which may be expanded in power series as @xmath86 in the coincidence limit , @xmath87 , the first three coefficients @xmath88 are given by @xmath89 henceforth we will absorb the determinant @xmath90 into the definition of the @xmath91 . despite the undifferentiated coincidence limits are the same , one may need to be careful with coincidence limits of derivatives . the corresponding green function associated with the laplacian",
    "can then be expanded as @xmath92 notice that the trace over fluctuations in the range @xmath93 is implemented by integrating @xmath94 over the range , @xmath95 .",
    "the heat kernel can be exploited to regularize the trace in the problem .",
    "for instance , it can be written in the coincidence limit @xmath96 and the following expression of great use below : @xmath97 all this allows us to calculate the second term in equation ( [ hef ] ) .",
    "so , taking the logarithm of equation ( [ ele ] ) and expanding we find @xmath98 as mentioned in section [ i ] , the contribution of the measure is still to be taken into account . to order one loop , that is given by minus the first term in equation ( [ cuatro ] )",
    ", so its contribution cancels out the first term @xcite .    by using the expression for the operator of fluctuations in equation ( [ aij ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to show that the last two terms are at least of the order @xmath75 , and therefore can just be dropped out .",
    "therefore , the only contribution for the renormalization comes from the second term . by taking two derivatives of equation ( [ d2 ] )",
    ", we get that in the coincidence limit , @xmath87 , @xmath99 the second line follows because , in the coincidence limit , only the term appearing from differentiating @xmath100 twice survives : @xmath101 from equations ( [ traab ] ) and ( [ aij ] ) we obtain the one loop effective bendings for the helfrich membrane for arbitrary codimension . for @xmath102 ( i.e. for a two - dimensional membrane ) only the terms with @xmath103 must be taken into account to renormalize any ultraviolet singularity , @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , the van vleck - morette determinant does not contribute at all .",
    "in addition , from equation ( [ aij ] ) we see that @xmath104[aajj ] for a two - dimensional membrane embedded into a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space . using this result into equation ( [ traab ] )",
    "we find the effective bending coupling which describes the crumpling transition , see e.g. reference @xcite .",
    "for the rigidity we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the linear size of the membrane and @xmath107 is a microscopic cutoff .",
    "if the codimension is set to @xmath108 , this equation reproduces precisely the result already found in references @xcite . in the string theory context , and using a different approach , this result was found in references @xcite .",
    "for the surface tension we obtain @xmath109 a result which coincides with that found in reference @xcite ( also for arbitrary codimension ) and with that from reference @xcite ( obtained for @xmath108 ) .",
    "this method provides a way to identify the @xmath110 parameter also for arbitrary @xmath8 . for a two - dimensional membrane",
    "we get @xmath111 which is also in agreement with the result found in reference @xcite for @xmath108 and , as expected , the renormalization of this @xmath112 coefficient does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "notice that if the contribution of the measure is not taken into account , the term @xmath113 gives a spurious one - loop contribution to the renormalization of both @xmath114 and @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , for a two - dimensional membrane the gaussian term does not give a contribution as it should because in this case the term is a topological invariant .",
    "in this paper we have used an extended covariant geometric approach recently developed to obtain the one loop effective bending couplings of a geometric hamiltonian associated with a @xmath0-dimensional membrane embedded into a @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "our result is in agreement with that appearing in the literature for a two - dimensional membrane embedded into a three - dimensional euclidean space .",
