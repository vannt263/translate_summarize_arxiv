    "the @xmath0 decay can be described  @xcite in terms of the lorentz invariant kinematic variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 defined as @xmath8 @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the charged pion mass , @xmath11 is the charged kaon mass , @xmath12 are the pion four - momenta , the indices @xmath13 correspond to the two pions of the same electric charge ( `` even '' pions ) , and the index @xmath14 to the other ( `` odd '' ) pion .",
    "the experimental dalitz plot distribution of the @xmath0 decay has been up to now experimentally analyzed  @xcite in terms of a polynomial expansion in powers of @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the linear and quadratic slope parameters ( terms proportional to odd powers of @xmath7 are forbidden by bose symmetry , and the variable @xmath7 is defined only up to a sign ) , and @xmath19 is the coulomb factor  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the pion charges , @xmath22 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath23 is the relative velocity of the pions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , expressed via the squared invariant mass of the pion pair @xmath26 as @xmath27    among the measurements of the slope parameters performed in the past , the most precise are reported in  @xcite based on @xmath28 @xmath29 decays , and in  @xcite based on @xmath30 @xmath31 decays .",
    "the primary goal of the na48/2 experiment at cern sps is the search for direct cp - violating charge asymmetries of dalitz plot linear slopes in @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath32  @xcite decays .",
    "however , the large data sample collected also allows a study of the dalitz plot distributions to be performed at a new level of precision , estimating the detector acceptance with a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the parameterization ( [ slopes ] ) of the @xmath0 decay distribution takes into account electromagnetic interactions only in the first approximation  @xcite and totally neglects pion rescattering effects  @xcite@xcite , which were recently shown by na48/2 to contribute significantly to the distribution of @xmath32 decays  @xcite .",
    "the current study aims to measure the dalitz plot slopes within the conventional framework ( [ slopes ] ) , and represents a first step towards a more complete description of the decay distribution .",
    "in particular , the presence of radiative effects and strong final state interactions , both ignored in the current work , imply that the slope parameters obtained , while fully comparable to those defined in the particle data group compilation  @xcite , should not be attributed any precise physical significance as far as the parameterization of the weak decay in terms of more fundamental parameters is concerned ; this would require an improved theoretical framework which is just being developed  @xcite , and its implementation is postponed for a forthcoming analysis .",
    "na48/2 collected data during two runs in 2003 and 2004 , with about 50 days of efficient data - taking in each run .",
    "this analysis is based on @xmath1 fully reconstructed @xmath0 events , corresponding to 55% of the data sample collected during the na48/2 run of 2003 .",
    "a beam line providing two simultaneous charged beams of opposite signs overlapping in space all along the decay volume was designed and built in the high intensity hall ( ecn3 ) at the cern sps .",
    "the beam line is a key element of the experiment , as it allows decays of @xmath31 and @xmath33 to be recorded at the same time , and therefore leads to cancellation of several systematic uncertainties for the charge asymmetry measurement .",
    "regular alternation of magnetic fields in all the beam line elements was adopted .",
    "the layout of the beams and detectors is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "the setup is described in a right - handed orthogonal coordinate system with the @xmath34 axis directed downstream along the beam , and the @xmath35 axis directed vertically up .",
    "the beams are produced by 400 gev/@xmath36 protons impinging at zero incidence angle on a beryllium target of 40 cm length and 2 mm diameter . charged particles with momentum",
    "@xmath37 gev/@xmath36 are selected in a charge - symmetric way by an achromatic system of four dipole magnets with zero total deflection ( ` achromat ' ) , which splits the two beams in the vertical plane and then recombines them on a common axis .",
    "then the beams pass through a defining collimator and a series of four quadrupoles designed to produce focusing of the beams towards the detector .",
    "finally the two beams are again split in the vertical plane and recombined in a second achromat , where three stations of a micromega - type  @xcite detector form a kaon beam spectrometer  @xcite ( not used in the present analysis ) .    after passing the cleaning and the final collimators ,",
    "the beams enter the decay volume housed in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank with a diameter of 1.92 m for the first 65 m , and 2.4 m for the rest .",
    "both beams follow the same path in the decay volume : their axes coincide within 1  mm , while the transverse size of the beams is about 1  cm . with @xmath38 protons incident on the target per burst of @xmath39 s duration , the positive ( negative ) beam flux at the entrance of the decay volume is @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) particles per pulse ,",
    "of which @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are @xmath31 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the @xmath44 flux ratio is about @xmath45 .",
    "the fraction of beam kaons decaying in the decay volume at nominal momentum is @xmath46 .",
    "the decay volume is followed by a magnetic spectrometer used for reconstructing @xmath0 decays .",
    "the spectrometer is housed in a tank filled with helium at nearly atmospheric pressure , separated from the vacuum tank by a thin ( @xmath47 ) kevlar composite window . a thin - walled aluminium beam pipe of 16 cm outer diameter traversing the centre of the spectrometer ( and all the following detectors )",
    "allows the undecayed beam particles and the muon halo from decays of beam pions to continue their path in vacuum .",
    "the spectrometer consists of four drift chambers ( dch ) : dch1 , dch2 located upstream , and dch3 , dch4 downstream of a dipole magnet .",
    "the magnet has a field integral @xmath48  tm , thus providing a horizontal transverse momentum kick @xmath49 for charged particles .",
    "the dchs have the shape of a regular octagon with a transverse size of about 2.8 m and a fiducial area of about 4.5 m@xmath50 .",
    "each chamber is composed of eight planes of sense wires arranged in four pairs of staggered planes oriented horizontally , vertically , and along each of the two orthogonal @xmath51 directions .",
    "the spatial resolution of each dch is @xmath52 m .",
    "the nominal momentum resolution of the magnetic spectrometer is parameterized as @xmath53 ( @xmath54 expressed in gev/@xmath36 ) .",
    "the measured resolution on the reconstructed @xmath55 invariant mass varied during the running period corresponding to the considered data sample in the range of @xmath56  mev/@xmath57 , depending on dch performance .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer is followed by a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( hod ) used to produce fast trigger signals and to provide precise time measurements of charged particles .",
    "the hodoscope has a regular octagonal shape with a transverse size of about 2.4 m. it consists of a plane of horizontal and a plane of vertical strip - shaped counters .",
    "each plane consists of 64 counters arranged in four quadrants .",
    "each quadrant is subdivided into 4 segments taking part in the trigger logic .",
    "counter widths ( lengths ) vary from 6.5 cm ( 121 cm ) for central counters to 9.9 cm ( 60 cm ) for peripheral ones .",
    "the hodoscope is followed by a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr ) , a hadronic calorimeter ( hac ) and a muon detector ( muv ) , all of which are not used in the present analysis .",
    "a detailed description of the components of the na48 detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 events are triggered with a two - level system . at the first level ( l1 ) ,",
    "the rate of @xmath58 khz is reduced to @xmath59 khz by requiring coincidences of hits in the two planes of the hod in at least two of the 16 non - overlapping segments . the second level ( l2 )",
    "is based on a hardware system computing coordinates of hits from dch drift times , and a farm of asynchronous microprocessors performing fast reconstruction of tracks and running a selection algorithm , which requires at least two tracks to originate in the decay volume with the closest distance of approach less than 5 cm .",
    "l1 triggers not satisfying this condition are examined further and accepted nevertheless if there is a reconstructed track which is not kinematically compatible with a @xmath60 decay of a @xmath29 having momentum of 60 gev/@xmath36 directed along the beam axis .",
    "the resulting trigger rate is about 10 khz .",
    "* reconstruction and selection *    event reconstruction is based entirely on the magnetic spectrometer information .",
    "tracks are reconstructed from hits in dchs using the measured magnetic field map rescaled according to the recorded value of electric current in the spectrometer analyzing magnet .",
    "three - track vertices , compatible with a @xmath0 decay , are reconstructed by extrapolation of track segments from the upstream part of the spectrometer back into the decay volume , taking into account the stray magnetic fields due to the earth s field and parasitic magnetization of the vacuum tank , and multiple scattering in the kevlar window .",
    "the stray field correction is based on a three - dimensional field map measured in the entire vacuum tank , and reduces the amplitude of the observed sinusoidal variation of the reconstructed @xmath61 invariant mass on the azimuthal orientation of the odd pion by more than an order of magnitude to a level below 0.05 mev/@xmath57 .",
    "the event kinematics is calculated using measured momenta and track directions extrapolated to the decay vertex .",
    "the principal selection criteria applied to the reconstructed variables are the following :    * total charge of the three pion candidates : @xmath62 ; * transverse momentum : @xmath63  gev/@xmath36 ; * longitudinal vertex position within the decay volume : @xmath64 ; * transverse vertex radius within the beam area : @xmath65  cm ; * kaon momentum within the nominal range : @xmath66 .    to improve the resolution on the kinematic variables , and to reduce the impact of differences between data and mc resolutions , the events were passed through a kinematic fitting procedure with three constraints ( constraining the initial kaon direction to by along the @xmath34 axis , and the @xmath61 invariant mass to the kaon mass ) .",
    "events with the quality of the kinematic fit corresponding to probability @xmath67 were rejected .",
    "the fraction of these rejected events increases as a function of deviation of the reconstructed @xmath61 mass from the pdg kaon mass @xmath68 ; in particular , all the events with @xmath69  mev/@xmath57 are outside the signal region , i.e. rejected by the above condition .    the geometric acceptance for the @xmath0 decays is mainly determined by the beam pipe traversing the centres of the dchs , and the material in the central region of each dch where central dch wires terminate .",
    "this material defines a region of high dch inefficiency - value of the @xmath0 decay : @xmath70 mev . ] .",
    "this inefficiency together with beam optics performance and variations influences the acceptance , and is difficult to reproduce accurately with a mc simulation . to minimize the effects of this problem",
    ", it is required that the transverse positions of each pion in dch1 and dch4 planes @xmath71 ( @xmath72 )",
    "satisfy the condition @xmath73  cm , where @xmath74 is the position of the momentum - weighted average of the three pions impact points : latexmath:[$\\vec r_{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^3 ( \\vec r_{\\pi i}|\\vec p_{\\pi i}|)/\\sum_{i=1}^3    extrapolated from dch1 and dch2 planes ) .",
    "@xmath74 corresponds to the transverse position of the line of flight of the initial kaon .",
    "the value of 18 cm was chosen to exclude safely the inefficient central region taking into account the beam sizes and variations of their average transverse positions .",
    "the described selection criterion costs about @xmath76 of the statistics ; however an appropriate mc description of the experimental conditions is more important than the sample size for the present analysis . as will be shown below in the discussion leading to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : datamc ] , the mc simulation of the experimental conditions reproduces the data distributions to a level of a few parts per mille .",
    "the selection leaves a sample of @xmath1 events , which is practically background free , as @xmath0 is by far the dominant decay mode of the charged kaon with more than one charged particle in the final state .",
    "the fact that backgrounds due to other decays of beam kaons and pions are negligible was also checked with a mc simulation .",
    "the distribution of the reconstructed @xmath55 invariant mass of data events ( before the kinematic fitting ) and its comparison with mc are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmass]a .",
    "the non - gaussian tails of the mass distribution are primarily due to @xmath77 decays in flight , and are well understood in terms of mc simulation .",
    "the ratio of mc to data mass spectra is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmass]b .",
    "it demonstrates the imperfection of resolution description in mc , and a deficit of mc events in the low mass region , which however contains a small fraction of the events , and is mostly outside the signal region .",

    "the l1 trigger condition requiring a coincidence of hits in two of the 16 non - overlapping hod segments is loose , as there are three charged particles in a fully reconstructed event , providing a rather low ( and stable in time ) inefficiency of @xmath83 for the selected event sample .",
    "however , the l1 inefficiency depends rather strongly on the kinematic variables .",
