    "further exact statements involving the applied work are rare , even though it has been demonstrated in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite that the aforementioned relations as well as different ones for other thermodynamic quantities  @xcite , namely entropy production and dissipated heat , can be derived from a broader perspective  @xcite .    experimental tests of non - equilibrium work relations have been carried out for a variety of different systems : for single colloidal particles in time - dependent harmonic  @xcite and non - harmonic potentials  @xcite , biomolecules in folding - unfolding assays  @xcite , mechanical torsion pendulums coupled to a heat bath  @xcite , and charge transitions in electronic devices  @xcite .",
    "common to all experimental systems studied so far is that they only consist of a small number of degrees of freedom , whose internal interactions are irrelevant . from an experimental point of view",
    "the reason for this is straightforward : controlling all external forces acting on a system of many coupled degrees of freedom during a non - equilibrium process in a well - defined way , i.  e. , measuring the applied work , is a huge challenge  @xcite .    on the other hand , a non - equilibrium phenomenon where the concept of work plays a prominent role",
    "is friction . for atomically flat surfaces sliding against each other , friction results from the interplay between",
    "externally applied forces and the nonlinear interaction of a large number of degrees of freedom making up extended contacts at the interface .",
    "inspired by simplistic models @xcite , a 2d system which has attracted much attention in recent years in the field of tribology in order to investigate in a controlled manner the spatiotemporal dynamics of crystalline surfaces under friction consists of a monolayer of interacting particles suspended in a fluid and mechanically driven through a periodic potential . since experimental realizations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite of this system have successfully shed light on the mechanisms behind friction , it represents also an appropriate model to investigate the statistical properties of the non - equilibrium work done by a well - controlled external force on a system composed of many interacting degrees of freedom .",

    ". the dynamics of this system mimics the transition from static to sliding friction , where a solid surface ( the colloidal monolayer ) is driven across a corrugated substrate ( the periodic light potential ) by an external force .",
    "we investigate the role of several parameters which can influence the shape of the work distribution , e.g. the number of particles used to locally probe the properties of the system and the integration time to measure the work .",
    "we find that , when tuning the control parameters to induce particle depinning from the substrate , there is an abrupt change of the shape of the work distribution . while in the completely static and sliding friction regime ,",

    "note that , even when immobile in average , the position of each individual particle fluctuates due to the collision of the solvent molecules .",

    "[ fig : fig3](a ) the results for the case of a pinned colloidal monolayer , where in average no mechanical work is done .",
    "here we plot the probability density function of the work @xmath95 done on @xmath119 particles by a force @xmath5  fn against a light potential of depth @xmath146 over different integration times , @xmath147 .",
    "we observe that , for all the values of @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath118 is gaussian and centered around @xmath148 , whose width increases with increasing @xmath88 .",
    "however , for @xmath149  s , the width of the distribution levels off and all curves collapse onto a master curve regarless of @xmath88 .",
    "this is further verified in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , where we plot as a dashed line the dependence of the standard deviation @xmath150 of the work on @xmath88 , observing a saturation to a constant value at sufficiently large @xmath88 .",

    "( [ eq : case1 ] ) , the variance of the gaussian work distribution levels off exponentially for integration times larger than the viscous relaxation time of the particles in the potential wells , @xmath151  s. this behavior of @xmath95 can be actually understood at the single - particle level . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the particle motion is strongly auto - correlated in time due to the energy stored by the confining light potential , which translates into a very narrow distribution @xmath118 .",
    "the motion becomes less and less correlated when @xmath88 approaches @xmath153 , and therefore each particle is able to perform larger brownian displacements within the potential wells both with and against the applied force , thus resulting in a broadening of @xmath118",
    ". nevertheless , the fluctuations of @xmath95 can not grow indefinitely with increasing @xmath88 because the single - particle motion is always bounded to the potential wells , giving rise to a saturation of @xmath150 for @xmath154 .",
    "although qualitatively similar as a function of @xmath88 , we observe a quantitative difference at @xmath155 between the standard deviation of @xmath95 for interacting particles with respect to that in the non - interacting case , as shown in the inset fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "this difference is due to the strong coupling between the particles , which gives rise to a complex non - linear particle dynamics within the potential wells .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) we illustrate the dependence of the work distribution @xmath156 on the integration time @xmath88 for the sliding friction regime of @xmath119 particles driven at @xmath4  fn and @xmath157 .",
    "we find that @xmath156 is gaussian and the location of the maximum increases linearly with increasing @xmath88 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanwork ] ) .",
    "once more , inspired by the comparison with non - interacting particles , where the width of the distribution scales as @xmath158 ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq : rescaling ] ) @xmath159 interestingly , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) we show that the work distributions , rescaled according to eq .",

    "this essentially means that in this frictional regime the variance of the work scales as @xmath160 even in presence of particle interactions .",
    "note that in this case , the particles are not confined to move in the potential wells , and consequently there is no intrinsic relaxation time in the dynamics , which explains the very fast convergence of @xmath144 to the master curve .",
    "quantitative differences are observed between the experimental @xmath144 and the case without interactions ( solid line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) ) , though .",
    "this occurs due to the narrowing of the work distribution due to the effective stiffening of the monolayer .",
    "we now show how the shape of the work distribution changes between the two very distinct cases previously studied , i.e. when changing the experimental parameters to induce a transition from the regime where all the particles are pinned on the substrate , to the depinning of the colloidal monolayer and subsequent free sliding .",
    "we recall that in the two extreme regimes of static and sliding friction , the work distribution is gaussian , even though the mean and variance behave differently as a function of @xmath99 and @xmath88 . while in static friction these quantities also depend strongly on both the elastic stiffness @xmath161 exerted by the substrate potential and the repulsive pair - interactions , they are only affected by the strength of the interactions for sliding friction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) we illustrate the effect on the shape of the work distribution for @xmath119 particles , computed over @xmath162  s , when increasing the value of the applied force @xmath3 at constant potential depth @xmath31 in order to induce particle depinning .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the work distribution becomes asymmetric with respect to the maximum with increasing @xmath3 , as can be observed for @xmath163  fn and @xmath164  fn . in particular ,",
    "non - gaussian tails appear at positive values of @xmath95 , as highlighted in the semilog plot of the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) . for these values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the spatio - temporal dynamics of the monolayer becomes heterogeneous , as can be observed from the particle trajectories of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) . for example",
    ", for @xmath163  fn there are regions where the particles are still confined by the potential wells , because the external force is still smaller than the maximum conservative force exerted by the light field : @xmath165 .",
    "however , the combination of thermal fluctuations and non - linear repulsive interactions can promote hops to the neighboring potential wells , thus creating collective motion of clusters of particles .",
    "the collective motion is in turn facilitated by the symmetry beaking induced by the external force .",
    "while the stagnant particles do not contribute to the mean value of the work but only to the fluctuations around @xmath166 , the non - gaussian tails originate from the work done on the sliding particles .",
    "this regime persists even when the complete monolayer can slide across the periodic substrate , as observed at @xmath164  fn and @xmath31 , where the particles undergo stick - slip motion . in this case , the spatial heterogeneity is induced by the corrugation potential , creating zones around the potential minima where the particles slow down , whereas they move faster when overcoming the potential barriers , as illustrated by the trajectories in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "note that this heterogeneity results also in a mean particle velocity @xmath167 much smaller than the maximum velocity that could be achieved in presence of a completely flat substrate ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "gaussianity of @xmath95 is recovered at sufficiently large @xmath105 , though , with a respective narrowing of @xmath118 .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",

    "a reduction of only @xmath168 in the potential depth @xmath6 , from @xmath169 to @xmath9 , is enough to observe a prominant change of the shape of the work distribution , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) . for this values of @xmath6 , the mean particle velocity changes from @xmath170 to @xmath171 , whereas the maximum velocity that could be achieved for this value of @xmath3 on a completely flat surface is @xmath172 .",
    "this dramatic change in the shape of @xmath118 reveals that not only the average tribological properties of the monolayer  @xcite but also the properties of the fluctuations of the work done on it become very sensitive when tuning the experimental parameters close to the depinning transition .",

    "the insets are semi - logarithmic representations of the same plots in the main figures.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : fig4 ]    finally , we investigate the work distribution @xmath118 within the context of non - equilibrium work relations .",
    "more specifically , we focus on the evaluation of quantity @xmath175 , which quantifies the asymmetry of the probability of observing positive work fluctuations , where the monolayer moves in the direction of the applied force , with respect to the probability of observing rare negative fluctuations , where the monolayer moves against the force .",

    "( [ eq : ft ] ) for the asymmetry function , @xmath176 , is not expected to hold generally for the ness system we study .",
    "indeed , for this kind of frictional processes , such a linear asymmetry relation is strictly valid only for the work done by an external force on a collection of non - interacting particles freely sliding on a perfectly flat substrate .",
    "in such a case , eq .  ( [ eq : ft ] ) is a direct consequence of the detailed fluctuation theorem , which only applies to the total entropy production of the system , and which in that specific case equals the work done by an external force . on the other hand , since the work defined by eq .",

    "this implies that in this case the second term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "it should be noted that the direct computation of the asymmetry function from @xmath118 is restricted to rather small values of @xmath99 and @xmath88 , because negative work fluctuations are difficult to sample with increasing values of such parameters .",

    "( [ eq : detailedft ] ) .",
    "this unconventional behavior of the asymmetry function can be traced back to the strong coupling between the particles forming the crystalline monolayer . indeed , with increasing strength of repulsive interactions , which is fixed in our experiment by the magnetic field @xmath191 , the width of the work distribution decreases because of the increasing stiffness of the colloidal crystal .",
    "note that in the limit of a perfectly stiff colloidal crystal , i.e. created by infinitely large repulsive interactions , the fluctuations of @xmath95 are completely suppressed . in this case",
    "the work distribution becomes a delta function , @xmath192 , which gives rise to @xmath193 .",
    "hence , for sliding friction @xmath182 must be an increasing function of the pair interaction strength , bounded by the values @xmath194 ( no interactions ) and @xmath195 ( infinitely large repulsions ) .",

    "the asymmetry function is approximately linear for small values of @xmath180 , with slope @xmath198 due to large negative work fluctuations on the stagnant particles .",
