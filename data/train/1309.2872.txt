    "these two configurations correspond to local minima of the mean field free energy @xmath19 $ ] at fixed mass , where @xmath20 is the density field .",
    "since the phase transition is second order , these two minima are at the same hight . on the other hand",

    "the system switches back and forth between the two metastable states ( bistability ) and the particles accumulate successively at the center or at the boundary of the domain .",
    "the difference with the kramers problem is that our stochastic variable is a density field @xmath29 instead of the position @xmath6 of a particle .",
    "furthermore , in our problem , the @xmath0 particles interact collectively and create their own free energy landscape while in the usual kramers problem a unique particle ( or a set of non - interacting particles ) moves in an externally imposed potential @xmath5 .",

    "random transitions between metastable states can be seen only close to the critical point , for moderate values of @xmath0 , and for sufficiently long times .",
    "this result also implies that the limits @xmath12 and @xmath38 do not commute .",
