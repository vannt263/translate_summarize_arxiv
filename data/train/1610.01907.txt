    "we first provide an overview of the dejmps protocol @xcite and then extend the description incrementally to our proposed setting ( including l and eve ) .",
    "the dejmps protocol is a recurrence - type entanglement distillation protocol which combines several noisy copies of a mixed state @xmath5 to distill a state arbitrarily close to the maximally entangled state @xmath99 , where @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , provided that the fidelity @xmath103 satisfies @xmath104 for the noiseless case .",
    "if the apparatus is noisy , then the minimal required fidelity @xmath9 needs to satisfy @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 depends on the noise level of the apparatus ) to achieve distillation . for more details on recurrence - type distillation protocols in general",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite . a basic step of the dejmps protocol is as follows :    input state of alice and bob : @xmath107 [ enu.oxford.step1 ] alice and bob apply the local basis change @xmath108 : @xmath109 [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] alice and bob apply a bilateral cnot ( bcnot ) : @xmath110 [ enu.oxford.meas ] alice and bob apply a @xmath111 and a @xmath112 measurement [ enu.oxford.steplast ] alice and bob communicate their measurement outcomes , @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , over a classical authentic channel alice and bob keep the subsystems @xmath115 and @xmath116 of step [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] alice and bob discard the measured subsystems @xmath117 and @xmath118 alice and bob discard both pairs    hence , we can write one basic distillation step of the dejmps protocol as the linear map @xmath119 where    @xmath120    modulo a normalization factor and where @xmath121 denotes the respective outcome of step [ enu.oxford.meas ] of protocol [ protocol.rd ] .",
    "the basic step is applied to all initial pairs , which comprises one distillation round .",
    "this distillation round is iterated where output states of the previous round are used as inputs for the next round .",
    "so we summarize the dejmps protocol as follows :    input state of alice and bob : @xmath122 where @xmath123 for all @xmath124 apply protocol [ protocol.rd ] to all pairs use the outputs of the previous step as input for the next distillation round    we remind the reader that the recurrence relations of the protocol ( i.e. update functions of the coefficients of an ensemble ) are central for the convergence analysis of the dejmps protocol . for bell - diagonal states , i.e. states of the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 , a straightforward computation yields the recurrence relations for the dejmps protocol to be @xmath127 where @xmath128 , see e.g. @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it has been shown analytically that the recurrence relations ( [ eqn.recurrencedejmps ] ) converge towards a unique and attracting fixed point provided the initial fidelity with @xmath10 , @xmath129 , is above @xmath130 .",
    "the recurrence relations of the dejmps protocol taking independent single qubit white noise , i.e. noise of the form @xmath131 acting on each qubit of alice into account , read far more complex . in the presence of noise",
    "we have strong numerical evidence that the dejmps protocol converges towards a unique and attracting fixed point depending on the noise level @xmath21 only .",
    "@xmath2    from figure [ fig : dejmps ] we suggest a linear relationship between @xmath132 ( where @xmath133 and @xmath134 denote the fixed point and the state after successfully completing @xmath2 distillation rounds respectively ) and the number of successful distillation rounds @xmath2 .",
    "we immediately observe that the slope only depends on the noise parameter @xmath21 , i.e. we have that    @xmath135    using @xmath136 , where @xmath46 denotes the number of input pairs , this implies @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath138 scales as @xmath139 as mentioned in the main text .",
    "furthermore we numerically find that the function @xmath140 monotonically grows for @xmath141 .",
    "we outline the remainder of this section as follows : first we derive the recurrence relations of the dejmps protocol in the most general setting , taking the noise applied by l into account as well as assuming that eve receives the leaked noise transcripts of l. we use those recurrence relations in the next subsection to provide analytical results regarding the fixed point of the recurrence relations , where the inputs are binary pairs and l only applies either @xmath142 or @xmath143 operators .",
    "we close the section with numerical results for general i.i.d .",
    "bell - diagonal pairs and the most general noise maps of l.    for i.i.d .",
    "input states the state of each system subject to distillation at an intermediate distillation round of the dejmps protocol is of the form @xmath144 , where @xmath145 are probability amplitudes , if we assume the noise is leaked to eve after every distillation round .",
    "the system @xmath28 models the pair of alice and bob , @xmath0 the system of l ( where the content of the register corresponds to the effective noise introduced to @xmath28 ) and @xmath40 the system of eve .",
    "l applies the noise processes before a basic protocol step to the systems of alice .",
    "moreover , l keeps track of the effective noise introduced using its system in a sense we clarify later .    in the following we use the notation    @xmath146    for the four pauli - operators .",
    "furthermore we denote by superscripts in brackets particle labels and by superscripts without brackets the power of an operator .",
    "l introduces the noise maps @xmath147 where @xmath148 .",
    "we observe that applying the noise map @xmath149 might flip the contents of the registers @xmath150 and @xmath151 depending on the values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this enables l to keep track of the noise introduced to a pair .",
    "there are two approaches how l can apply the noise maps @xmath149 : stochastically in terms of cptp maps , or coherently in terms of unitaries acting on an enlarged hilbert space . here",
    "we assume the latter approach , but provide the analysis of the noisy dejmps protocol in terms of cptp maps and purifications .    to show that these are equivalent",
    ", first suppose that l owns a register @xmath154 set to the state @xmath155 where @xmath156 are the probabilities of applying the respective noise map @xmath149 .",
    "l uses the register @xmath154 to apply the noise maps @xmath149 coherently controlled to the input state @xmath157 .",
    "we observe that tracing out @xmath154 after applying all the noise maps @xmath149 in a controlled fashion yields @xmath158 on the other hand , assume that l applies the noise process in terms of a cptp map @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath159 we observe that @xmath160 will be , in general , a mixed state , thus there exists a purification on a larger hilbert space . as all purifications are unitarily equivalent ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , we choose the purification @xmath161 hence @xmath162 } = n \\rho$ ] .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the pure state @xmath163 can be generated by applying the unitaries @xmath149 , coherently controlled by the register @xmath154 , to @xmath164 .",
    "this equivalence allows us to assume that l introduces the noise as a cptp map , applying @xmath149 with respective probabilities @xmath165 and purifying the state after the basic step is executed by alice and bob .",
    "since the noise of l is applied before the basic distillation step is executed by alice and bob , the result of one noisy distillation step reads as @xmath166 which needs finally to be purified .    in order to evaluate ( [ eqn.overall ] ) , we proceed as follows :    * step 1 : we first compute @xmath167 which corresponds to the state after the noise map @xmath168 is applied by l and the basic step of the distillation protocol is executed by alice and bob . *",
    "step 2 : we apply the unitary @xmath169 , which acts only on l s systems and whose purpose we clarify later , to the previous equality .",
    "* step 3 : we have to determine the purification held by eve if the noise is leaked to her . in doing so",
    ", we trace out eve and then provide her with the purification of the resulting state ( which corresponds to leaking the noise transcripts to eve ) .",
    "we observe that applying the noise map @xmath170 to @xmath171 yields @xmath172 this observation suggests the following notational simplifications : @xmath173 using this notation we rewrite ( [ eqn.proofrec1 ] ) as @xmath174 .",
    "this is the state of alice , bob , l , and eve after the noise map @xmath170 is applied by l to the first pair . in order to compute ( [ eqn.overall ] )",
    "we define @xmath175 which corresponds to the state after the noise map @xmath168 is applied and @xmath176 which is the state after the noise map @xmath168 , one basic distillation step and the update of l s noise register by @xmath169",
    ". thus we rewrite ( [ eqn.overall ] ) as @xmath177 according to ( [ eqn.proofrec00 ] ) alice and bob apply one basic step of the dejmps protocol to the state @xmath178 .",
    "recall that step [ enu.oxford.step1 ] of protocol [ protocol.rd ] maps @xmath179 to @xmath180 and that step [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] maps @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",
    "thus we conclude that after step [ enu.oxford.step1 ] and [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] of protocol [ protocol.rd ] the state of alice , bob , l , and eve is @xmath183 following protocol [ protocol.rd ] , a @xmath184-measurement of the target pair of the bcnot , i.e. the subsystem @xmath185 , is applied to ( [ eqn.proofrec2 ] ) .",
    "next alice and bob communicate their respective measurement outcomes over a classic authentic channel . if the measurement outcomes coincide , alice and bob keep the source pair , i.e. subsystem @xmath186 of step [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] , else they discard both subsystems @xmath186 and @xmath185 .",
    "we assume that both measurements yield the outcome @xmath187 .",
    "if both measurement outcomes yield @xmath188 , no phase factor @xmath189 would be required in the expression ( [ eqn.proofrec3 ] ) .",
    "the coinciding measurement outcomes imply @xmath190 . to summarize , the state post - selected on the measurement outcomes @xmath187 of alice and bob is @xmath191 recall that l stores in its register attached to the pair of alice and bob the effective noise introduced .",
    "for that purpose we introduce the unitary @xmath169 as well as an ancilla system @xmath192 set to the state @xmath193 . applying @xmath169 to all three registers of l yields @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the so called flag update function defined in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath195 returns the effective noise introduced on the source pair of step [ enu.oxford.bcnot ] of protocol [ protocol.rd ] .",
    "applying @xmath169 to ( [ eqn.proofrec3 ] ) gives @xmath196 we remind the reader that @xmath197 is the state after the application of i ) the noise map @xmath168 , ii ) a basic distillation step , and iii ) the update of l s noise register by @xmath169 .",

    "hence this step is crucial in order to guarantee successful distillation .",
    "for that purpose , we measure @xmath543 of @xmath370 pairs by applying two - qubit measurements . to be more precise , we apply a @xmath544 to the first and @xmath545 measurement to the second pair .",
    "we refer to this measurements by @xmath546 and @xmath547 respectively .",
    "we observe that the state @xmath99 is a common eigenstate of @xmath546 and @xmath547 with eigenvalue @xmath187 .",
    "we define to each pair of pairs a random variable @xmath548 for @xmath549 with @xmath550 whenever both measurements @xmath546 and @xmath547 yield outcome @xmath187 and @xmath551 else .",
    "furthermore we assume for the expected value @xmath552 of the fidelity with @xmath10 that @xmath553 , where @xmath554 will be fixed below .",
    "the protocol will be aborted if the estimate is below @xmath555 .    from ( [ eqn.robust.qchannel ] )",

    "this implies for the quantum channel @xmath536 that , if @xmath557 the parameter estimation step will abort , independent of the input provided by eve .",
    "thus we assume for the subsequent analysis that @xmath558 .",
    "moreover we define @xmath559 .",
    "hence we get by the hoeffdings inequality for the probability of an error larger than @xmath560 in our measured estimate @xmath561 for the fidelity the following expression : @xmath562 thus the probability of aborting the protocol due to an error in the parameter estimation is exponentially small in number of necessary input pairs . in order to fix @xmath563 we recognize that alice and bob abort the protocol whenever @xmath564 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath565 . inserting the definition of @xmath560 yields @xmath566 and thus @xmath567 .",
    "what remains to be shown is that the probability of aborting the protocol in the distillation phase is also exponentially small in the number of input pairs .",
    "for that purpose , we assume that the noise level @xmath12 of the apparatus is such that distillation is feasible . in the following",
    "we show that we can force the probability of abort due to entanglement distillation to be exponentially small in terms of requested input pairs .",
    "we assume that alice and bob are left with @xmath568 pairs after parameter estimation .",
    "recall that the chernoff inequality for a sequence of independent bernoulli random variables @xmath569 where @xmath570 and @xmath571 $ ] reads as @xmath572 moreover , we observe that a basic distillation step can be modelled by a bernoulli random variable @xmath548 where @xmath570 is the probability of succeeding ( measurement outcomes coincide ) .",

    "thus we may safely assume that @xmath579 .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath580 . eliminating the recurrence relation yields",

    "eve after the distillation protocol is @xmath595 close to the output of the ideal protocol .",
    "the latter , since the register of l is not accessible to any of the parties and thus is traced out , yields the state of the form ( provided the protocol was not aborted ) the teleportation of any state @xmath5 from alice to bob will yield the state thus the only information eve can obtain is what noise operator was applied on the teleported state , and nothing more ",

    "<S> furthermore we provide an analysis if the final state of the entanglement distillation protocol is quantum one - time padded as this immediately decouples eve , i.e. the state after quantum one - time padding is separable with respect to alice / bob and eve . to complete the security characterization of the proposed protocols , we introduce the robustness of entanglement distillation protocols . </S>",
