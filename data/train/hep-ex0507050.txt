    "deviations of the triple gauge boson couplings ( tgcs ) from their values predicted by the standard model ( sm ) are a possible indication for new physics ( np ) beyond the sm .",
    "if no light higgs boson exists the mechanism responsible for the restoring the unitarity could well be the strong electroweak symmetry breaking ( sewsb ) mechanism @xcite . as a consequence , at energies below np cut - off scale @xmath5 the effects of np",
    "are reflected in the tgc s values leading to their deviations @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the sm predictions .",
    "since these deviations decrease as @xmath8 increases , their observation requires a very precise measurements , more precise than those at lep and tevatron . with a high event statistics at a @xmath3 collider option at the international linear collider ( ilc ) it is possible to reach a high precision of the tgc measurements .",
    "anomalous tgcs affect both the total production cross - section and the shape of the differential cross - section as a function of the w production angle . as a consequence , distributions of w decay products",
    "are changed also .",
    "thus , the information about tgcs can be extracted from the angular distributions of the reconstructed w boson . in @xmath3 collisions",
    "the tgcs contribute through _ t_-channel w - exchange .",
    "in this study the expected sensitivity for a measurement of the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath9jets at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is investigated .",
    "there are two possible initial @xmath3 helicity states depending on the photon handedness , denoted as @xmath12 ( if two photons have the same helicities ) and @xmath13 ( if two photons have the opposite helicities ) .",
    "total and differential cross - sections distributions as a function of the anomalous tgcs ( @xmath14 ) , simulated with the tree - level monte carlo ( mc ) generator whizard @xcite , for all possible initial and final state helicity combinations are shown in figures  [ fig : total_gg ] and [ fig : differ_gg ] .",

    "it includes a tracking and calorimeter simulation and a reconstruction of energy - flow - objects ( efo ) .",
    "only the efos with a polar angle above @xmath16 are taken for the w boson reconstruction , simulating the acceptance of the photon collider detector as the only difference to the @xmath15-detector @xcite .",
    "the signal and background events are studied on a sample of events generated with whizard and overlayed with low energy @xmath17 events ( _ pileup _ ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding number of added pileup events per bunch crossing is 1.8 @xcite .",
    "the informations about the neutral particles ( _ neutrals _ ) from calorimeter and charged tracks ( _ tracks _ ) from tracking detector are used to reconstruct the signal and background events . the potential background for both initial @xmath18 states",
    "are @xmath19 events that can mimic the signal with four jets when gluons are radiated in the final state .",
    "the qcd corrections to the @xmath20-pair born level production cross - section are different for the two @xmath18 states : in the @xmath13 state the corrected cross - section is @xmath21 with @xmath22 being of @xmath23(1 ) , resulting in a born cross - section correction of 4 - 5@xmath24 . in this study",
    "this correction is not taken into account . in the @xmath12 state",
    ", the suppression factor @xmath25 @xcite leads to a born level cross - section close to zero but the qcd corrections lead to an enhancement by double - logarithmic terms @xmath26 @xcite . to estimate the corrected cross - section for the @xmath12 state the @xmath27 diagrams are taken into account i.e. the diagrams contributing to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 cut parameter ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) for a variable centre - of - mass energy @xmath33 is defined by generating only events with the invariant masses of each parton pair above 30 gev resulting in an emission of hard gluons .",
    "the signal events for both @xmath18 states and background events for the @xmath13 state are generated with omega matrix element generator @xcite taking into account only the lowest order feynman diagrams .",
    "the qcd correction for the @xmath20 pair production in the @xmath12 state is estimated generating the background events with madgraph @xcite .      in order to minimise the pileup contribution to the high energy signal tracks ,",
    "the information on the track impact parameters is used in the same way as in the case of @xmath34-collisions @xcite allowing the rejection of @xmath35 of pileup tracks and @xmath36 of signal tracks .",
    "the remaining tracks are combined into four jets and the events with a number of efo greater than 40 and number of charged tracks greater than 20 are accepted only .",
    "the two reconstructed w bosons are denoted as forward ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and backward ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) where @xmath41 is a w boson production angle in the centre - of - mass system ( cms ) .",
    "the angle between the two jets belonging to the same w boson , boosted to the cms , is used as a next selection criteria - if the angle is within a given range of @xmath42 , the event is accepted .",
    "further , events with a total mass above 125 gev and the individual w boson mass of @xmath43 are accepted .",
    "that results in efficiencies of approximately 53% for signal and less than 2% for background events i.e. in a purity of 81% in both @xmath18 states .",
    "the top pair production is estimated to be negligible .",
    "the final angular distributions for the @xmath13 state state . ] used for the tgcs error estimation are shown in figure  [ fig : final ] .",

    "a sample of @xmath44 sm signal events is generated with whizard and passed trough the detector simulation . each event is described reconstructing five kinematical variables - the w production angle with respect to the @xmath45 beam direction @xmath41 , the w s polar decay angles @xmath46 ( angle of the fermion with respect to the w flight direction measured in the w rest frame ) and the azimuthal decay angles @xmath47 of the fermion with respect to a plane defined by w and the beam axis . in hadronic w",
