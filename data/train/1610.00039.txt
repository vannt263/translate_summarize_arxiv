    "infectious processes spread through specific contact ties between individuals . for any fixed time , these transmission routes constitute a network@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . for a deleterious infection ,",
    "a treatment aims to reduce the probability of transmission from one node to another .",
    "for example , in the context of hiv , one strategy to reduce the overall rate of transmission is to test and treat all infected individuals , which is the goal of several ongoing clinical trials@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "other spreading processes propagate through specific ties between individuals , such as diffusive processes of ideas or practices@xcite , and can also be modeled as an infectious process .    to determine",
    "if a treatment is effective , one might randomly assign some individuals to receive the treatment , and others to receive standard care or a placebo , which randomization ensures balance on average in the predictors between the two arms .",
    "this type of experiment is called a _ randomized controlled trial _ ( rct ) . when this is not possible",
    ", a population of individuals may be available for observation in which two or more groups have different exposures related to the outcome , which can be made to resemble an rct if all confounders are correctly adjusted for@xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition , _ interference _ occurs when an individual s outcome depends on the outcomes of other individuals in addition to exposure @xcite .",
    "this can be avoided by assuming that clusters of individuals are independent , and adjusting for the correlation of outcomes within clusters@xcite @xcite as well as the probability of exposure@xcite .",
    "dependent outcomes within clusters generally results in a decrease in statistical _ power _ , or the probability of detecting an exposure effect if one exists , and this decrease can depend on epidemic dynamics as well as within - cluster network structure@xcite .    generalized estimating equations ( gees)@xcite are a semi - parametric approach for estimating a treatment effect in randomized trials when outcome data are correlated within clusters@xcite .",
    "this approach produces unbiased estimates of the average marginal treatment effect across all clusters , whereas mixed effect models provide an estimated intervention effect conditional on adjustment covariates@xcite . accounting for the correlation between baseline covariates and the outcome can improve the efficiency of treatment effect estimates , using either the augmented gee@xcite or other semiparametric approaches , such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation ( tmle)@xcite . when the exposure is not randomized , estimating the effect of exposure without bias requires that the propensity that each cluster is exposed to treatment be correctly estimated .",
    "few studies of infectious processes so far use contact network information to improve statistical efficiency using these approaches@xcite .",
    "this paper investigates the degree to which exposure effect estimates in simulated and empirical observational studies of epidemic processes are improved by adjusting for features of the contact networks and infections at baseline .",

    "the second half of the likelihood contains factors of one half to account for the fact that _ self - edges _ ( edges from one node to itself )",
