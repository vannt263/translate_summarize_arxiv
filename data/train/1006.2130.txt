    "from the appearance of the quantum mechanics many attempts have been made to recover the laws of the classic mechanics through some classic limit .",
    "the more common scheme of this type includes the _ _ quantum decoherence__. this process is in charge to erase the terms of interference of the density matrix , that are classically inadmissible , since they prevent the use of a classical ( boolean ) logic .",
    "in addition , decoherence leads to the rule that selects the candidates for classic states .",
    "as it is pointed out in the brief historical summary of paper @xcite , three periods can be schematically identified in the development of the general program of decoherence @xcite . a first period , when the arrival to the equilibrium of irreversible systems was studied .",
    "during this period , authors as van kampen , van hove , daneri , et al__. _ _ developed a formalism for explaining the decoherence phenomenon that was not successful at the time but it established the bases of this study .",
    "the main problem of this period was that too long decoherence times were found , if compared with the experimental ones . in a second period",
    "the decoherence in open systems was studied , the main characters of this period were zeh and zurek . in their works ,",
    "the decoherence is an interaction process between an open quantum system and its environment .",
    "this process , called _ environment - induced decoherence _ ( eid ) , determines , case by case , which is the privileged basis , usually called _ moving preferred basis _ where decoherence takes place in a _ decoherence time _ @xmath0 and it defines the observables that acquire classic characteristics and they could be interpreted in some particular cases as properties that obey a boolean logic .",
    "this is the orthodox position in the subject @xcite .",
    "the decoherence times in this period were much smaller , solving the problem of the first period . recently , in a third period it becomes evident that dissipation was not a necessary condition for decoherence @xcite and the study of the arrival to equilibrium of closed systems was also considered .",
    "we will not discuss closed systems in this paper but for the sake of completeness we will make only some comments .",
    "closed system will be discussed at large elsewhere .    in this work",
    "we focus the attention on eid , which is a well known theory , with well established experimental verifications , which makes unnecessary any further explanation . on the contrary other formalisms",
    "are not so well established , but they must be taken into account for the sake of completeness ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we will introduce a tentative definition ( for eid and other formalisms ) of moving preferred basis where the state decoheres in a very short time @xmath0 , so the main problem of the first period is solved in a convenient and general way .",
    "our main aim is to present a new conceptual perspective that will clarify some points that still remain rather obscure in the literature on the subject , e. g. the definition of the moving preferred basis .      in previous works",
    "we have resumed the common characteristics of the different approaches of decoherence , which suggest the existence of a general framework for decoherence within which these approaches can all be framed ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . according to this general framework , that was developed in @xcite and",
    "will be completed in future papers , decoherence is just a particular case of the general problem of irreversibility in quantum mechanics .",
    "since the quantum state @xmath1 follows a unitary evolution , it can not reach a final equilibrium state for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , if the non - unitary evolution towards equilibrium is to be accounted for , a further element has to be added to this unitary evolution .",
    "the way to introduce this non - unitary evolution must include the splitting of the whole space of observables @xmath3 into the relevant subspace @xmath4 and the irrelevant subspace .",
    "once the essential role played by the selection of the relevant observables is clearly understood , the phenomenon of decoherence can be explained in four general steps :    1 .",
    "* first step : * the space @xmath5 of relevant observables is defined .",
    "* second step : * the expectation value @xmath6 , for any @xmath7 , is obtained .",
    "this step can be formulated in two different but equivalent ways : * a coarse - grained state @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 for any @xmath10 , and its non - unitary evolution ( governed by a master equation ) is computed ( this step is typical in eid ) . *",
    "@xmath11 is computed and studied as the expectation value of @xmath12 in the state @xmath1 .",
    "this is the generic case for other formalisms .",
    "* third step : * it is proved that @xmath13 reaches a final equilibrium value @xmath14 , then @xmath15 + this also means that the coarse - grained state @xmath8 evolves towards a final equilibrium state:@xmath16 + the characteristic time for these limits is the @xmath17 , the _ relaxation time .",
    "* fourth step : * also a _ moving preferred basis",
    "_ @xmath18 must be defined as we will see in section i.b .",
    "this basis is the eigen basis of certain state @xmath19 such that@xmath20 the characteristic time for this limit is the @xmath0 , the _ decoherence time . _",
    "the final equilibrium state @xmath21 is obviously diagonal in its own eigenbasis , which turns out to be the final preferred basis .",
    "but , from eqs .",
    "( [ int-01 ] ) or ( [ int-02 ] ) we can not say that @xmath22 or @xmath23 then , the mathematicians say that the unitarily evolving quantum state @xmath1 of the whole system _ only has a _ _ weak limit , _ symbolized as : @xmath24 equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ int-01 ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the coarse - grained state @xmath8 also has a weak limit , as follows from eq.([int-02 ] ) : @xmath25 equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ int-02 ] ) . also@xmath26 these weak limits mean that , although the off - diagonal terms of @xmath1 never vanish through the unitary evolution , the system decoheres _ from an observational point of view _ , that is , from the viewpoint given by any relevant observable @xmath7 .    from this general perspective , the phenomenon of destructive interference , that produced the decoherence phenomenon , is relative because the off - diagonal terms of @xmath1 and @xmath8 vanish only from the viewpoint of the relevant observables * * @xmath7 , and the superselection rule that precludes superpositions only retains the states defined by the corresponding decoherence bases as we will see .",
    "the only difference between eid and other formalisms for decoherence is the selection of the relevant observables ( see @xcite for details ) :    .",
    ": :    in eid the relevant observables are those having the following    form:@xmath27    where @xmath28 are the observables of the system and    @xmath29 is the identity operator of the environment",
    ". then    eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] )    reads@xmath30 .",
    ": :    in the other formalisms other restriction in the set of observables    are introduced      the moving preferred basis was introduced , case by case in several papers ( see @xcite ) in a non systematic way . on the other hand in references @xcite and @xcite roland omns introduces a rigorous and almost general definition of the moving preferred basis based in a reasonable choice of the relevant observables , and other physical considerations .    in this paper",
    "we will introduce an alternative general definition to define this basis : as it is well known the eigen values of the hamiltonian are the inverse of the characteristic frequencies of the unitary evolution of an oscillatory system .",
    "analogously , for non - unitary evolutions , the poles of the complex extension of the hamiltonian are the _ catalogue _ of the decaying modes of these non - unitary evolutions towards equilibrium ( see @xcite )",
    ". this will be the main idea to implement the definition of our moving preferred basis .",
    "i. e. we will use these poles .",
    "we will compare and try to unify these two methods in the future .",
    "really we already began this approach with omns in section iii .      in section",
    "i we have introduced a general framework for decoherence . a general candidate for moving decoherence basis is introduced in section [ gendefmovdecbas ] , which is implemented in three toy models and the time of decoherence and the relaxation time in these approaches are defined . in principle",
    "these definitions can be used in eid and probably for generic formalisms . in section iii",
    "we will present the paradigmatic eid : omns ( or lee - friedrich ) model . and show that the pole method yields the same results .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we will draw our conclusions .",
    "one appendix completes this paper .",
    "in this section we will try to introduce a very general theory for the moving preferred basis for _ any relevant observable space _ @xmath31",
    "then it is necessary to endow the coordinates of observables and states in the hamiltonian basis @xmath32 ( i.e. the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 with extra analytical properties in order to find the definition of a moving preferred basis in the most , general , convincing , and simplest way",
    ". it is well known that this move is usual in many chapters of physic e. g. in the scattering theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well known that evolution towards equilibrium has two phases .",
    "i.- a exponential dumping phase that can be described studying the analytical continuation of the hamiltonian into the complex plane of the energy ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , a fact which is also well known in the scattering theory .",
    "ii.- a final polynomial decaying in @xmath35 known as the long time of khalfin effect ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , which is very weak and difficult to detect experimentally ( see @xcite )",
    ".    these two phases will play an important role in the definition of the moving preferred basis .",
    "they can be identified by the theory of analytical continuation of vectors , observables and states . to introduce the main equation we will make a short abstract of papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we begin reviewing the analytical continuation for pure states .",
    "let the hamiltonian be @xmath36 where the free hamiltonian @xmath37 satisfies ( see @xcite .",
    "( 8) or @xcite ) @xmath38 and ( see @xcite .",
    "( 9))@xmath39 then ( see @xcite .",

    "the eigen vectors of @xmath43 are given by the lippmann - schwinger equations ( see @xcite .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13))@xmath44 let us now endow the function of @xmath45 with adequate analytical properties ( see @xcite ) . e.g.",
    "let us consider that the state @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 is such that it does not create poles in @xmath48 ( resp . in @xmath49 and therefore this function is analytic in the whole complex plane .",
    "this is a simplification that we will be forced to abandon in realistic cases as we will see .",
    "moreover we will consider that the function @xmath50 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 is analytic but with just one simple pole at @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 in the lower halfplane ( resp .",
    "another pole @xmath55 on the upper halfplane@xmath56 ( see @xcite for details of figure 1 . ] ) .",
    "there can be many of such poles but , by now , we will just consider one pole for simplicity , being the generalization straightforward",
    ". then we make an analytic continuation of the positive @xmath45 axis to the curve @xmath57 of the lower half - plane as in figure 1 .",
    "then ( see @xcite .",
    "( 29 ) ) we can define@xmath58 and ( see @xcite .",
    "( 31))@xmath59 where @xmath60 means analytic continuation .",
    "finally it can be proved that ( see @xcite ) @xmath61 a simple extension of the eigen - decomposition of @xmath43 to the complex plane      we could repeat what we have said about the pure states and the hamiltonian with the states , observables , and the liouvillian operator @xmath62 ( see a review in @xcite ) .",
    "but we prefer to follow the line of @xcite and keep the hamiltonian framework and discuss the analytical continuation of  @xmath63 that we will also symbolize as @xmath64 .",
    "in fact from section i.a we know that this scalar is the main character so we will study its analytical properties ad nauseam .",
    "so let us call ( see @xcite .",
    "( 42 ) ) @xmath65 then a generic relevant observable is @xmath7 ( see @xcite eq .",

    "this is why we can find the moving preferred basis in a general case containing eid as particular case .",

    "let us observe that    i- .",
    "the vanishing of the second , third , and fourth therms of eq .",
    "( [ 70 ] ) are _ exponential decaying_. this will also be the case in more complicated models with many poles .",
    "ii.- the @xmath96 means that the evolution of the last term of this equation corresponds to a polynomial decaying in @xmath35 ,  i. e. to the _ khalfin evolution_. this is a very weak effect detected in 2006 @xcite .",

    "( [ tc ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) are essentially equivalent . ] .",
    "let us diagonalize @xmath8 as or the initial conditions may just choose a discrete basis ( see below).]@xmath107 where @xmath108 is the moving eigenbasis of @xmath8 .",

    "the eigen states of the @xmath19 are those that we will choose for the moving decoherence basis .",

    "the relaxation time @xmath17 is the corresponding to the khalfin term , i.e. an extremely long time so@xmath127",
    "the khalfin term is so small ( see @xcite ) that can be neglected in most of the experimental cases .",
    "so let us consider the case of two poles @xmath52 and @xmath128 ( and no relevant khalfin term ) where eq .",

    "( [ 700 ] ) to ( [ asterisco-c ] ) we can see that , diagonalizing this last equation , we obtain the moving preferred basis .",
    "then in this case we see that the  relaxation is obtained by an exponential dumping ( not a khalfin term ) and @xmath139 again , in this case when @xmath120 @xmath105 we have that @xmath140 so once more we reach eq .",
    "( [ asterisco-c ] ) .",
    "namely @xmath1 becomes diagonal in the moving preferred basis in a time @xmath0 .      before considering the many poles case",
    "let us make some general remarks .",
    "i.- let us observe that some @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 and @xmath144 may be zero , depending in the observable @xmath145 so , in the case of many poles , may be some poles can be detected by @xmath12 and others may not be detected and disappear from the formulae ( see appendix ) .",
    "this also is the cases for the initial conditions : @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 may be zero .",
    "but also the @xmath12 or the @xmath150 may create some poles .",
    "so some poles may be eliminated or created by the observables or the initial conditions while others may be retained .",
    "but in general we will choose @xmath12 and @xmath150 in such a way that they would neither create or eliminate poles .",
    "ii.- from what we have learned in both models ( see eqs .",
    "( [ nuevo-0 ] ) and ( [ nuevo ] ) ) we always have@xmath151      let us now sketch the case of a system with @xmath76 poles located at @xmath152 these poles are the ones that remain after @xmath12 and @xmath150 have eliminated ( or created ) some poles ( see remark i ) .",
    "in this case it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ 70 ] ) ( with no khalfin term ) becomes:@xmath153 where @xmath154 is the final equilibrium value of @xmath155 in the most general case the @xmath156 will be placed either at random or not . anyhow in both cases they can be ordered as@xmath157 so in the case of @xmath158 poles , we can plot @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 in figure 3",
    ".    then if @xmath162 it is quite clear that the relaxation time is @xmath163 so the relaxation time is defined with no ambiguity .",
    "this is not the case for the decoherence time .",
    "really each pole @xmath156 defines a decaying mode with characteristic time@xmath164 these poles contain the essence of the decaying phenomenon and the definition of the decoherence time depends on their distribution and other data like the initial condition .",
    "precisely    i.- for a completely random distribution clearly the best choice is@xmath165 then @xmath166 and the moving preferred basis is @xmath167 i.e. the basis that diagonalizes @xmath168    ii.- but for other kinds of distributions , if the distribution of poles obey certain law or have some patterns , we may chose something like@xmath169 as we will see in the example in the next section .",
    "the choice of @xmath170 is based on the _ initial conditions _ and usually also introduces the concept of _ _ macroscopicity _ _ ) and variable @xmath171 .",
    "example of this choice are the omns model and the toy models in the final remake i of the next section .    once the decoherence time @xmath172is chosen the definition ( [ def ] ) changes to@xmath173 where the sum contains all the terms such that @xmath174 then the poles in evolution ( [ ev ] ) are those that produces the slowest decaying modes that we will call the _",
    "p - relevant poles , _",
    "i. e. those that have influence in the period @xmath175 _ _ the remaining poles such that @xmath176 that we will can the _ p - irrelevant poles _ , and have no influence in the period @xmath177    once the decoherence time is chosen the moving preferred basis is univocally defined .",
    "it is @xmath125 , the basis that diagonalize @xmath19 , a state that evolves only influenced by the p - relevant poles , and such that @xmath178 when @xmath179    @xmath125 is our candidate for a general definition of moving preferred basis .",
    "our more complete and simplest example of decoherence in open systems is the omns pendulum  ( i. e. oscillator ) in a bath of oscillators , that we will compare with the poles theory in the following subsections .",
    "in fact the omns model could be considered a poles model if we retain the poles and neglect the khalfin term .",
    "moreover in the omns philosophy the moving preferred basis must be related to some collective variables  in such a way that they would be experimentally accessible . in this case",
    "this variable is the center of mass of the pendulum , i. e. the mean value of the position of a coherent state . in @xcite page 285 a one dimensional `` pendulum '' ( the system ) in a bath of oscillators ( the environment ) is considered .",

    "in fact , in some stages of the treatment omns is forced go to the continuos spectrum .",
    "a complete treatment of this continuous model can be found in @xcite.]@xmath180 where @xmath181 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the system , @xmath182 are the creation ( annihilation ) operator for each mode of the environment , @xmath45 and @xmath183 are the energies of the system and each mode of the environment and @xmath184 are the interaction coefficients .",
