    "the classic _ isoperimetric problem _ is to find the largest amount of area that can be enclosed using a simple closed curve of fixed length .",
    "the answer is of course a circle , although the proof is more difficult than some may realize . the ancient greeks knew the problem and the solution .",
    "in fact , pappus records that zenodorus found the solution first @xcite . the first mathematical proof , however , is credited to steiner @xcite in the 19th century .",
    "he proved that if a solution exists , then it must be a circle .",
    "caratheodory completed the proof by showing that a solution does exist .",
    "we refer to the excellent prefaces in plya and szeg @xcite and in bandle @xcite for more historical details .",
    "the solution to the classic isoperimetric problem is stated by the isoperimetric inequality @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the length of any simple closed curve in the plane and @xmath5 is the enclosed area .",
    "equality holds if and only if the simple closed curve is a circle .",
    "a related problem is to find the simple closed curve with least perimeter that encloses a given area . for a single area in @xmath6 or a single volume in @xmath1",
    "the problem is equivalent to the classic isoperimetric problem .",
    "what if we wanted , however , to enclose and separate two different prescribed areas in the plane ?",
    "the solution is not two disjoint circles as we can use less perimeter by letting the two different areas share some of their perimeter .",
    "the solution @xcite is a _ standard double bubble _ consisting of two chambers enclosed by three arcs of circles all meeting at angles of @xmath7 .",
    "( see figure  [ double ] . )    the problem that seeks the least perimeter closed curve , surface , or hypersurface that encloses and separates @xmath0 given volumes in @xmath1 is called the _",
    "generalized soap bubble problem_. the name comes from the fact that soap bubbles minimize surface tension for the fixed volumes of air enclosed .",
    "another related problem is to separate or tile @xmath1 into equal volume pieces as efficiently as possible . in @xmath6 , the _ honeycomb conjecture",
    "_ states that a regular hexagonal tiling is the least perimeter tiling that separates the plane into unit area pieces , although it is not immediately clear what is meant by least perimeter in this infinite region context .",
    "one interpretation is to consider this problem as the limit of the @xmath0 soap bubble problem in @xmath6 as @xmath8 .",
    "only recently has progress been made on even the smallest cases of the generalized soap bubble problem . in 1976 , almgren @xcite proved the existence and regularity of a solution to the generalized soap bubble problem in dimensions bigger than 2 .",
    "taylor@xcite improved this result for dimension 3 in the same year . in 1992 ,",
    "morgan @xcite proved existence and regularity of a solution in dimension 2 .",
    "the double bubble problem in @xmath6 ( the least perimeter embedded planar graph that encloses and separates two given areas in the plane ) was solved in 1994 by a group of undergraduates led by frank morgan @xcite .",

    "we examine some additional restrictions imposed on bubble complexes with equal pressure regions .",
    "we show that the number of edges that bound a portion of a region is limited to three , four , five or six edges .",
    "then we show how a few parameters control the shapes of 3-gons , 4-gons and 5-gons .",
    "in addition , we examine the way in which these @xmath0-gons can meet in a perimeter minimizing complex .",
    "for example , when a 3-gon shares an edge with another 3-gon , they are both adjacent to another 3-gon , thus creating a standard triple bubble component .    in chapter 5",
