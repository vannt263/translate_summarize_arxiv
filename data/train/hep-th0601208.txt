    "rolling tachyons  @xcite have been studied in the various contexts including boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) , dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) type effective field theory ( eft ) , noncommutative field theory ( ncft ) , boundary string field theory ( bsft or background - independent string field theory ) , cubic string field theory ( sft ) , and matrix models .",
    "various meaningful results were achieved in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous rolling tachyon configurations and have been contributed to understand real - time evolution of an unstable d - brane even in terms of closed string degrees through the bridge of duality  @xcite .",
    "a cornerstone knowledge about the homogeneous rolling tachyons is on their species , i.e. , they are classified by three . in terms of bcft , they are hyperbolic cosine and sine type rolling tachyon configurations  @xcite called as full s - branes  @xcite , and exponential type rolling tachyon  @xcite called as half s - brane  @xcite .",
    "all of them share the same late - time behavior of vanishing pressure  @xcite so that classification is made by their different initial - time behaviors .",
    "this classification was also confirmed in dbi type eft and ncft even in a form of exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "though the late - time behavior of the rolling tachyon represented by vanishing pressure is reproduced in bsft  @xcite , the simple observation on the three species of rolling tachyons was not made in bsft  @xcite which is appropriate to describe the open string tachyon physics  @xcite , a representative off - shell dynamics in string theory .",
    "this may be related with complicated form of the tachyon kinetic term in bsft .    in this paper",

    "the rolling tachyons with dbi type electromagnetic coupling are also taken into account .",
    "we show that the gauge field equation forces its homogeneous field strength to be constant , and thus species of the homogeneous rolling tachyons are the same as those without electromagnetic coupling .    in section 2",
    "we write down equations of motion from the bsft tachyon action , describing dynamics of an unstable d@xmath0-brane .",
