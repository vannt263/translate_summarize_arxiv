    "ferroelectric ( fe ) tunnel junctions ( ftjs ) that are composed of fe thin films of a few unit cells sandwiched between two electrodes ( in most cases the top and bottom electrodes are different ) have attracted much more attention during the last decade .",
    "@xcite it is generally believed that the interplay between ferroelectricity and quantum - mechanical tunneling plays a key role in determining tunnel electroresistance ( ter ) or tunneling current and ter effect usually takes place upon polarization reversal . due to the strong coupling of fe polarization and the applied field , the electric - field control of ter or tunneling current ,  @xcite spin polarization ,  @xcite and electrocaloric effect  @xcite can be achieved , which makes fes promising candidates for nondestructive fe storage ,  @xcite fe memristor ,  @xcite spintronics ( magnetization ) ,  @xcite or electrocaloric  @xcite devices . meanwhile ,",
    "another mechanically ( including strain or strain gradient ) induced ter is found recently , which also shows their potential applications in mechanical sensors , transducers and low - energy archive data storage decices .",
    "@xcite note that having different electrodes for the ftjs ( some experiments use conductive atomic force microscope tips instead of the top electrodes ) is usually required for a large effect at low bias voltage though the ftjs with same electrodes may also display interesting performances .",
    "@xcite also note that all the functionalities in these devices are strongly related to the thermodynamic stability and switching ability of ftjs .",
    "@xcite therefore , a fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity of ftjs , especially their size effects , is crucial at the current stage of research .",
    "unfortunately , no consensus has been achieved on whether there exists a critical thickness @xmath0 below which the ferroelectricity disappears in ftjs , especially for those with different top / bottom electrodes .",
    "it is believed that an electrostatic depolarizing field caused by dipoles at the fe - metal interfaces is responsible for the size effect .",
    "@xcite however , recent theoretical studies suggest that the choice of electrode material may lead to smearing of size effect or even vanishing of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite for example , it was reported that choosing pt as electrodes would induce a strong interfacial enhancement of the ferroelectricity in pt / batio@xmath1(bto)/pt ftjs , where @xmath0 is only 0.08 bto unit cell .",
    "@xcite in addition , the results of a modified thermodynamic model  @xcite and first - principles calculations  @xcite both indicate that bto barrier with dissimilar electrodes , i.e. pt and srruo@xmath1 ( sro ) electrodes , might be free of deleterious size effects .",
    "in contrast , it has been reported that asymmetric combination of the electrodes ( including the same electrodes with different terminations ) will result in the destabilization of one polarization state making the asymmetric ftjs non - fe .",
    "@xcite and the up - to - date studies reported that the fixed interface dipoles near the fe / electrode interface is considered the main reason for that detrimental effect .",
    "@xcite considering the importance of the physics in ftjs with dissimilar top and bottom electrodes , we are strongly motivated to investigate the size effect in such asymmetric ftjs .",
    "it was pointed out as early as 1963 that the contribution of different electronic and chemical environments of the asymmetric electrode / fe interfaces would induce a large long - range electrostatic built - in electric field @xmath2 in fe thin films .",
    "@xcite @xmath2 becomes more significant in asymmetric ftjs and should be taken in to account .",
    "@xcite in this study , we use a multiscale thermodynamic model  @xcite to investigate the effect of such built - in electric field on the phase transition of asymmetric ftjs by neglecting the short - range interface dipoles . as a result",
    ", we discover an unusual fe - polar non - fephase transition in asymmetric ftjs .",
    "then , we make detailed analysis of the contribution of the built - in electric field to fe phase transition , i.e. @xmath0 , what happens below @xmath0 , transition temperature @xmath3 , and temperature dependence of dielectric response of the asymmetric ftjs .",

    "the fe films are fully strained and grown on thick ( 001 ) substrate with the polar axis lying normal to the fe - electrode interfaces .",
    "@xcite we denote the two interfaces as 1 and 2 , with surface normals @xmath6 and @xmath7 pointing into the electrodes .",

    "[ fig1 ] . the exact value and direction of @xmath2 can be determined as  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 which is the work function steps for fe - electrode @xmath10 interface at zero polarization is simply defined as the potential difference between the fe and the electrode @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite with the help of first - principles calculations , one could easily obtain @xmath9 through the analysis of the electrostatic potential of ftjs where fe films are in the paraelectric ( pe ) state .  @xcite    then , the free energy per unit surface of the fe layer is presented as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are landau coefficients .",
    "@xcite @xmath13 is the epitaxial strain and @xmath14 are the elastic compliances coefficients . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the first order and second order coefficients of the surface energy @xmath17 expansion for the two fe - electrode interfaces .",
    "@xcite @xmath18 is the applied electric field along the polar axis .",
    "@xmath19 is the depolarizing field which can be determined from the short - circuit condition such that :  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the permittivity of vacuum space , and @xmath22 indicates the background ( i.e. without contribution of the spontaneous polarization ) dielectric constant .",
    "@xmath23 are the effective screening lengths of the two interfaces and are dependent on the polarization direction if the electronic and chemical environments of fe / electrode interfaces are different .",
    "@xcite for the two opposite polarization orientations , the direction dependence of @xmath23 will induce the asymmetry in potential energy and hence will produce the ter effect , besides the depolarizing field effect due to the polarization difference between two opposite orientations .",
    "@xcite however , we ignore such an effect due to the lack of information about the direction dependence of @xmath23 and we mainly focus on the role of the built - in field in this study .",

    "@xcite in asymmetric ftjs , such asymmetry parameters @xmath24 and @xmath26 can introduce a potential energy profile difference and therefore induce the ter effect .  @xcite    the equilibrium polarization can be derived from the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium : @xmath27 the dielectric constant @xmath28 under an applied field @xmath29 whose direction is along the polar axis can be determined as :  @xcite @xmath30 the multiscale thermodynamic model used in this study combines first - principles calculations and phenomenological theory and its detailed description can be found elsewhere .",
    "@xcite in the previous study , it is reported that @xmath2 could result in a smearing of the phase transition and an internal - bias - induced piezoelectric response above @xmath3 in asymmetric ftjs .",
    "@xcite however , adding to the forgoing controversy on the size effects , further analysis of the effect of built - in field on the fe transition in asymmetric ftjs is still absent . inserting eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) into eq . ( [ 2 ] ) results in a term that encompasses an odd power of the polarization : @xmath31 , which leads to asymmetric thermodynamic potentials .",
    "we shall show that this term which behaves mathematically as identically as the phenomenological term suggested by bratkovsky and levanyuk  @xcite will result in an unusual fe - polar non - fephase transition in asymmetric ftjs .",
    "for a quantitative analysis , we consider a fully strained bto film sandwiched between pt ( electrode 2 ) and sro ( electrode 1 ) epitaxially grown on ( 001 ) srtio@xmath1 substrates .",
    "we neglect the energy difference of the asymmetric surfaces , i.e. by setting @xmath32 , @xmath33 , to insure that the effect of @xmath2 is clearly observable from the calculations since it is reported that surface effects are generally much smaller than that of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite all the parameters we used are listed in ref . 65 .",
    "we first examine the effect of @xmath2 on the ferroelectricity of asymmetric ftjs .",
    "previous studies indicate that the direction of @xmath2 in asymmetric pt / bto / sro ftjs points to pt electrode with higher work function .",
    "@xcite all recent results show indeed that a strong preference for one polarization state namely @xmath34 while @xmath4 disappears at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite according to the definition of ferroelectricity , the spontaneous polarization of the fe materials is switchable under an ac electric field .",
    "@xcite however , knowing that the spontaneous polarization of fe materials is switchable under an ac electric field ,  @xcite recent reports  @xcite are rather confusing and remain incomplete on this point .",
    "indeed , in addition to the forementioned divergence in the size effects , two different transition temperatures at which the two polarization states reach zero are obtained ( see ref .",
    "37 ) , which may be confusing since there should be only one finite phase transition temperature for disappearance of ferroelectricity . in order to avoid such confusions",
    ", we used the classical definition of ferroelectricicity  @xcite in the following parts .",
    "we make further analysis of the physical formulation of @xmath0 in asymmetric ftjs .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) is a nonlinear equation and yields at mostthree solutions @xmath35 , two of them corresponding to minima and the other one to a saddle point ( unstable state ) . whether the solution is a minimum",
    ", a maximum or a saddle point can be revealed through inspecting the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of the total free energy @xmath36 . because the asymmetric ftj is internally biased , i.e.",
    ", the energy degeneracy between positive @xmath34 and negative @xmath4 is lifted , one of the minima corresponds to the equilibrium state ( the global minimum ) of the system ( the direction of which is along @xmath2 ) and the other minima corresponds to a metastable state ( a local minimum ) of the system .",
    "it means that the presence of two different electrodes in asymmetric ftjs results in a preferred polarization orientation of the fe plate .",
    "having found all @xmath35 solutions as a function of @xmath5 , one can clearly see that metastable state and unstable state solutions become closer to each other and coincide at finite @xmath5 , henceforth the number of solutions @xmath35 drops from three to one . according to the bistable property of fe materials ,",
    "this finite @xmath5 is just @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite as long as there are three @xmath35 solutions : two of these three solutions correspond to stable / metastable polarizations so that two orientations of polarization are possible in the bto layer and thus it is fe . switching the asymmetric ftj into its unfavoured high energy polarization may be difficult .",
    "if there is the only @xmath35 solution corresponding to the unstable state , although it attains a finite value , it is not fe anymore and may be called pe .",
    "indeed it would be more appropriate to consider it as polar non - fesince @xmath35 has a unique finite value .",
    "@xcite ftjs with no built - in field @xmath37 will exhibit two energetically equivalent stable polarization states ( @xmath34 and @xmath4 ) along with an unstable polarization state at @xmath38 below @xmath0 .",
    "all the forgoing discussions can be clearly and easily understood in the schematic representation of @xmath39 curves with different bto thicknesses as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which is quite similar with the results of fe thin films with / without consideration of the fixed interface dipoles near the asymmetric fe / electrode interface  @xcite or fe superlattices with / without interfacial space charges .",
    "@xcite together with previous results ,  @xcite we conclude that no matter the @xmath2 is considered as a long - range field or a short - range surface one , it can not induce the vanishing of @xmath0 in asymmetric ftjs , which is in contrast with other works .  @xcite    note that polar non - fephase is actually a pyroelectric phase because there is a non - switchable polarization in this phase",
    "this kind of phase transition has once been reported in fe thin films with asymmetric electrodes  @xcite or fe superlattices with interfacial space charge .",
    "@xcite as we discussed in the formation of @xmath0 , polar non - fephase indeed always corresponds to the unstable state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and this kind of non - switchable polarization may not be stable at all .",
    "however , breaking up the system into 180@xmath40 domain stripes is unambiguously ruled out due to the long - range pinned field @xmath2 . in plane vortex formation",
    "@xcite is also inhibited because the large compressive strain favors more 180@xmath40 domain stripes .",
    "@xcite the ferromagneticlike closure domains are predicted to form in ultrathin fe films or fe capacitors even below @xmath0  @xcite and are experimentally confirmed well above @xmath0 recently .",
    "@xcite however , typical fe closure domains  @xcite are also not expected in polar non - fephase where 180@xmath40 domains in the closure domain structure should be suppressed . but local rotations of non - switchable polarization ( @xmath4190@xmath40 ) are still likely to occur and result in a closure - like domain structure since the local change of the direction of the non - switchable polarization especially near the fe / electrode interface is helpful to minimize the system energy .",
    "@xcite although such closure - like domains can be favored below @xmath0 ( @xmath413 nm at least ) , it is clear that the fe barrier as a whole is not fe according to our forgoing analysis that shows the polarization is not switchable under external electric fields .",
    "while a detailed analysis of the built - in field effect on domain formation is beyond the scope of this study , we suggest that more rigorous simulations should be made in the future .",
    "it can be seen that the asymmetric ftjs below @xmath0 can not be used for fe memory applications in which two thermodynamic stable polarization states are needed to encode 0and 1 in boolean algebra .",
    "@xcite however based on our calculation , one should expect a resistance change below @xmath0 between the non - switchable polarization state and the other one being ferroelectrically dead .",
    "this result agrees well with recent works on pt / bto / pt ftjs that even below @xmath0 , the resistance of the ftj would change by a factor of three due to the interface bonding and barrier decay rate effects .",
    "@xcite we argue that the ter effect below @xmath0 suggested in our work may be essentially attributed to the asymmetric modification of the potential barrier by the nonzero barrier height ( @xmath42 ) ( see eqs .",

    "as expected , the curves of @xmath34 and @xmath4 are symmetric with respect to @xmath38 at @xmath37 where @xmath0 is about 1 nm which is smaller than that of sro / bto / sro , i.e. 1.6 nm .  @xcite when @xmath43 , the supposed degeneracy between @xmath34 and @xmath4 occurs , i.e. @xmath34 is enhanced while @xmath4 is reduced so the coordinate of the center of the hysteresis loop along the polarization axis [ 1/2(@xmath34 + @xmath4 ) ] is shifted along the direction of @xmath34 .",
    "it is shown that such a displacement of the hysteresis loop along the polarization axis becomes more significant as the strength of @xmath2 increases .",
    "it may be attributed to the imprint caused by @xmath2 such that the whole shape of the hysteresis loop will shift along the direction of the field axis which is antiparallel to the direction of @xmath2 .",

    "furthermore , it is found that though the transition temperatures for two directions are different , they both decrease as the built - in field increases which is consistent with the results without any external field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , which indicates that the built - in field forces the transition to take place at a reduced temperature .",
    "we make further comments on the built - in field effect in asymmetric ftjs .",
    "the main assumption in this study is that @xmath24 does not change during the polarization reversal .",
    "@xcite the presence of @xmath24 which results in an asymmetric potential energy and barrier height differences by switching the polarization will induce the ter effect .",
    "@xcite note that the switching of the polarization in the asymmetric ftjs may change the value of @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite however , according to our analysis , the variation in @xmath24 ( even changing its sign occurs during the polarization reversal ) does not alter the main results of this study due to its induced broken spatial inversion symmetry of ftjs .",
    "in addition to the built - in field , if the surface term @xmath25 is nonzero , the main conclusions of this paper will not change as well .",
    "in summary , on the basis of a multiscale thermodynamic model , a detailed analysis of the changes brought by the built - in electric field in asymmetric ftjs is made .",
    "it is demonstrated that the critical thickness does exist in asymmetric ftjs . below the critical thickness , it is found that there is a recovery of polar non - fe polarization due to strong cancelling of the depolarizing field by the built - in field , and closure - like domains are proposed to form to minimize the system energy . it is found that the built - in electric field could not only induce imprint and a behavior of smearing of the fe phase transition but also forces the phase transition to take place at a reduced temperature . a fundamental limit of transition temperature dependence of the barrier layer thickness on the work temperature of ftj - type or fe capacitor - type devices is proposed and should be simultaneously taken into account in the further experiments .",
    "hopefully , our results will be helpful to the fundamental understandings of phase transitions in asymmetric ftjs .",
