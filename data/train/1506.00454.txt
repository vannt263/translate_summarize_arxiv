    "this is the adsorption of n@xmath0 on w(110 ) , where measured sticking curves eluded a simple interpretation on the basis of the aforementioned experimental trends @xcite .",
    "in fact , seemingly contradictory evidence from molecular beam measurements could only be reconciled through explicit dynamical simulations , which revealed a complex interplay between a direct and indirect adsorption mechanism depending on initial conditions @xcite .",

    "the uncertainties introduced by current semi - local dft functionals thus prohibit a clear identification of the dominant adsorption mechanism .",
    "they also do not allow to fully disentangle whether the approximate treatment of substrate mobility or the deficiencies in the underlying dft energetics are the primary reason for remaining small differences to the experimental data .",
    "all these intricacies nevertheless point already at this stage at the limitations of trying to directly deduce insight on the character of the adsorption process from measured sticking curves alone .",

    "the favorable agreement of experimental and theoretical sticking extends over the entire range of incidence energies shown in fig .",
    "1 . nevertheless , there is a disturbing difference in trend with @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the measured slight rise of sticking with @xmath4 , the calculated fs sticking curve shows a continuous decline .",
    "this decline is in fact even more pronounced when calculating the sticking curve on the basis of the dft - rpbe pes , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . repeating the above static analysis also for this pes we find its topology to be qualitatively very similar to that of the dft - pbe pes .",
    "important quantitative differences are therefore nicely summarized in terms of the two dynamically relevant quantities , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in line with the general construction idea of the rpbe functional @xcite ,",
    "the molecular well is much more shallow in the dft - rpbe pes ( @xmath55ev ) , while reflecting the concomitant weaker bond activation the dissociation barrier is with @xmath56mev about twice as high as at the dft - pbe level .",
    "even though the ratio of these two quantities is thus much less favorable , on purely energetic grounds dissociative adsorption would nevertheless still be classified as non - activated even at the dft - rpbe level , i.e. the molecules gain much more energy upon adsorption than is needed to overcome the dissociation barrier .",
    "the decline of the sticking curve with @xmath4 obtained with both functionals is thus a purely dynamical effect . aiming to extract its origin we analyze the trajectories in more detail .",
    "first of all , this trajectory analysis largely confirms the dynamical relevance of the minimum energy path depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "independent of the incidence energy and for both functionals ( as well as all later surface mobility treatments ) , essentially all trajectories leading to adsorption show the molecules accumulating first around the hollow molecular chemisorption well .",

    "we note that summing up the red and gray bars yields the initial sticking probabilities @xmath57 of the respective functional at the particular incidence energies @xmath4 and surface temperatures @xmath3 shown in figs  [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "]    after arrival at the molecular chemisorption state , the fate of the molecules is almost instantaneously decided at low @xmath4 at the dft - pbe level .",
    "this is demonstrated by the time distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a , which indicates after which time a trajectory has been classified as dissociated , reflected or trapped .",
    "recall that trapping is assigned to all molecules that have neither dissociated nor reflected after 10ps simulation time , which is why the corresponding fraction is shown at this time bin in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a , essentially all trajectories dissociate in a rather direct fashion , i.e. within several picoseconds and thus after a minimal number of surface rebounds ( typically @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is completely different at the dft - rpbe level , where almost all trajectories instead end up being trapped , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b .",
    "the different reactivity of the two dft pess ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) thus does have a significant effect in terms of entirely changing the dominant adsorption mechanism from direct ( dft - pbe ) to indirect ( dft - rpbe ) . at low incidence energies",
    "this does not show up in the sticking coefficient though , as already a small amount of energy transfer to internal vibrational , rotational or lateral translational degrees of freedom is sufficient to prevent immediate desorption , and since molecules correspondingly trapped in the surface potential are being counted as contributing towards sticking .",
    "we note that in the absence of any other dissipation mechanism within the fs approximation , such trapped molecules would in fact eventually be able to desorb .",
    "notwithstanding , the time scale for a corresponding transfer of energy back into the perpendicular translational motion would be rather long .",
    "in reality other dissipation channels would have set in during this time , which is why it is reasonable to count these trajectories as contributing to the sticking coefficient .",
    "also the rather arbitrarily set maximum integration time of 10ps should in this respect not matter , as we have verified by applying the trapping classification already after 8ps .    while the pes differences thus do not show up at low @xmath4 , they do increasingly at larger incidence energies .",
    "corresponding fast molecules are less efficiently steered to direct dissociation .",
    "neither is the energy transfer to internal degrees of freedom efficient enough anymore to quickly remove the large excess kinetic energy and trap them in the surface potential . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c and d for the largest @xmath59mev we thus find for both pes descriptions a large number of molecules that are reflected very quickly from the surface . without efficient trapping ,",
    "only the decreasing fraction of molecules that already starts from configurations favorable for a more or less direct dissociation mechanism can contribute to the decreasing sticking seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "such a mechanism is generally disfavored by a smaller acceleration into a more shallow adsorption well and a higher barrier to surmount , which is why the concomitant decline of @xmath52 with @xmath4 is also much more pronounced at the dft - rpbe level .    from a bulk of work on o@xmath0 adsorption on late transition",
    "metals @xcite , the pbe and rpbe functionals can be seen as popular representatives for opposite ends within the range of current gradient - corrected functionals , with the prior likely more on the overbinding side and the latter possibly slightly underbinding . within the understanding of the just presented dynamical analysis concomitant uncertainties in the energetic description of the molecular chemisorption well ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) at the semi - local dft level",
    "are nevertheless unlikely to cause the wrong trend of the sticking curve with @xmath4 as compared to the experimental data .",
    "rather than the overall attractiveness of the pes , the major reason for the decline of the calculated sticking curves lies in an insufficient ability to trap the molecules in the chemisorption well .",
    "this thus points more to a weakness of the fs approximation , in which such a trapping can only result from energy transfer into molecular rovibrational degrees of freedom . in reality",

    "the resulting essentially constant @xmath62 is furthermore only weakly dependent on @xmath34 and thus in seemingly improved agreement with experiment .    the mechanistic analysis of the pbe - based adsorptive trajectories reveals the relevance of the same reaction pathway above hollow as found in the fs dynamics and depicted in fig .",

    "the differences in reactivity compared to the fs case do therefore not originate from the activation of different reaction pathways or adsorption mechanisms .",
    "we instead rationalize the increased so sticking at high @xmath4 with the improved efficiency of direct dissociation above hollow due to an enhanced steering of impinging fast molecules in the now `` elastic '' surface potential .",
    "the energy transfer to the surface possible within the so model simply dampens the perpendicular translational motion of highly accelerated o@xmath0 already upon first impact .",
    "this increases the probability that they will be effectively captured by the attractive potential and subsequently led to dissociation .",
    "this picture arises from the analysis of the significant amount of trajectories that start from the exact same initial conditions and yet are reflected within the fs but dissociated within the so model .",
    "the corresponding energy profiles reveal the simultaneous onset of the o@xmath0-pd(100 ) interaction and the so kinetic energy , and therewith underline the decisive role of the so energy uptake in ultimately determining the trajectory outcome .    quantifying this so energy uptake in fact",
    "reveals that considerable amounts of energy are transferred back and forth between the o@xmath0 molecule and the so even on the short time scales until dissociation .",
    "at the moment when the trajectories fulfill the dissociation criterion an average of 350mev ( considering the sum of kinetic and potential energy of the oscillator ) is stored in the so for @xmath40k and a low incidence energy of 25mev .",
    "for the fast molecules with @xmath59mev this value even increases up to 510mev . in the absence of any further dissipation channel ,",
    "the so is thus severely overheated . as a result",
    ", one may expect that the promotion of direct dissociation over `` proper '' molecular trapping is to some degree artificial and that the agreement with the experimental sticking curve on the dft - pbe so level is thereby merely fortuitous .",
    "this view is indeed supported by the results obtained with the dft - rpbe pes , where , as already indicated , dissociation is generally less favored due to the limited accessibility of the corresponding transition state . here",
    ", the partial damping on account of the surface mobility also succeeds in trapping the molecules , but only for a slightly extended period of time compared to the fs situation .",

    "[ fig : fig3]d . the ongoing strong energy exchange between trapped molecules and hot",
    "so thus promotes in this case rather a delayed reflection than ( equally artificially ) facilitating dissociation .",

    "analysis of the underlying glo trajectories nevertheless reveals again substantial changes that are fully consistent with the expectations from the so analysis . also at the dft - pbe level there is now a contribution of molecular trapping to the total sticking , i.e. the glo succeeds at least to some extent in removing the artificially enhanced direct dissociation seen at the so level .",
    "the average amount of energy stored in the so itself at the moment when trajectories fulfill the dissociation criterion is now reduced to 210mev ( 260mev ) at @xmath46mev ( 425mev ) and @xmath40k , as compared to the 350mev ( 510mev ) found before within the so model . owing to the non - equilibrium nature of o@xmath0 dissociation on pd(100 ) @xcite , this is still far away from the thermal equilibrium value of a surface atom @xmath63 25mev even within the limitations of the glo model , but still suggests more efficient surface equilibration . the latter is also reflected in the dependence of the trapping contribution to the overall sticking on the @xmath43 conditions summarized in fig .",

    "this is , in fact , a rather intriguing , if not disturbing result . at the glo level both dft - pbe and dft - rpbe descriptions yield rather similar sticking curves , and this despite predicting completely different adsorption mechanisms : predominantly direct dissociation with a small contribution of molecular trapping at low substrate temperatures within dft - pbe versus completely indirect dissociation within dft - rpbe .",
    "compared to the experimental data both functional levels reach indeed the same achievements and exhibit the same shortcomings .",
    "they correctly predict a near - unity sticking over the range of studied incidence energies with if at all only a weak dependence on substrate temperature . yet , both fail to reproduce the measured slight increase in sticking with @xmath4 , or more precisely they overestimate the experimental sticking at low @xmath4 .",
    "dissipation seems to affect much more the high incidence energy part of the sticking curves .",
    "this view is also supported by the robustness of the obtained sticking results when varying the parameters entering the glo model as described in section ii .",
    "all in all , these variations lead only to insignificant variations of @xmath66 within a few percent . in turn , the uncertainties in the semi - local dft description of the actual chemisorption well ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) do critically affect the actual adsorption mechanism , yet again do not seem to propagate to the total sticking curve . in light of the dynamical analyses performed for the fs , so and glo models , we suggest that a slightly incorrect description of the entrance channel part of the pes can be one reason for the remaining small discrepancy  within these effective treatments of dissipation .",
    "presently unaccounted small activation barriers in this channel for some molecular configurations are likely to specifically affect the total sticking at low incidence energies and could therewith constitute the `` missing ingredient '' to a fully quantitative agreement with experiment .    unless there is a problem in the experimental data ,",
    "the obvious and systematic limitation of these models is an equally likely cause : reducing the phononic fine structure of the pd surface into computationally convenient augmentations of the frozen - surface within the o@xmath0-pd(100 ) interaction can not , by construction , account for the energy exchange with an entire layer of moving surface atoms .",
    "only detailed future studies including all these degrees of freedom will allow to completely capture the influence of surface mobility on the calculated sticking curves .",
    "we presented a detailed calculation of the initial sticking coefficient of o@xmath0 at pd(100 ) based on classical trajectory calculations on first - principles 6d potential energy surfaces .",
    "the specific motivation was to elucidate the role of energy dissipation during the exothermic surface reaction by augmenting the 6d dynamics with various effective accounts of surface mobility , as well as to assess in how much classical trends in the sticking data reveal the underlying adsorption mechanism .",
    "to our knowledge for the first time , we observe that an account of energy dissipation leads to qualitative changes of the calculated sticking curve as compared to the prevalent frozen - surface approximation . compared to the much more frequently studied adsorption of h@xmath0 ( also at pd surfaces @xcite ) this might not come as altogether surprising in view of the much smaller mass mismatch of oxygen with palladium .",
    "it is , however , remarkable with respect to the rather similar n@xmath0 on w(110 ) system @xcite ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "intermediate in its mass ratio compared to h@xmath0/pd ( @xmath68 ) and o@xmath0/pd ( @xmath69 ) , it exhibits pes characteristics intriguingly similar to that of o@xmath0/pd(100 ) , i.e. non - activated paths to dissociation alongside a precursor molecular well . yet , the n@xmath0/w(110 ) sticking curve showed no change when applying effective treatments beyond the frozen - surface approach .    the hierarchical application of fs ,",
    "so and glo models reveals how the calculated sticking curves sensitively respond to details of energy exchange with the substrate .",
    "already some degree of energy exchange as provided by the so model enhances the steering of highly accelerated impinging o@xmath0 , while `` proper '' molecular trapping necessitates an account of further bulk dissipation channels as in the glo .",
    "the large amount of energy released in the exothermic reaction otherwise simply leads to an overheating of the so degree of freedom .",
    "compared to the n@xmath0/w(110 ) system , one important difference to note is the considerably deeper molecular well in the corresponding fs - pes description ( @xmath70ev @xcite and @xmath71ev respectively within dft - rpbe ) which leads to a significantly increased acceleration of impinging molecules and requires more than twice as much energy to be dissipated upon reaching the molecular state .",
    "the latter may also hint towards a different response of the real phonons  potentially mitigated by the different phononic properties of the bare surfaces alone .",
    "it might thus comprise a key discriminating characteristic , which could be further elucidated by more conceptually and computationally demanding studies including a more realistic phonon heat bath @xcite .",
    "for two different pes representations based on the dft - pbe and dft - rpbe functionals we correspondingly obtain at the glo level a rather satisfying agreement with experimental sticking data @xcite .",
    "this in principle appealing robustness of the simulation results with respect to the uncertainties of semi - local dft energetics does not extend to the level of the underlying adsorption mechanism though .",
    "the more attractive dft - pbe energetics predicts a predominantly direct dissociation mechanism with some amount of molecular trapping at low substrate temperatures .",
    "the less attractive dft - prbe energetics instead predicts adsorption almost exclusively via the molecular precursor state .",
    "completely different adsorption mechanisms therewith lead to rather similar sticking curves that agree equally well with the experimental data .",
    "independent of the small quantitative discrepancies that remain in either case with respect to experiment , this clearly demonstrates that an unambiguous deduction of the adsorption mechanism from the sticking data alone is not feasible for this system . such fingerprinting may work for simpler adsorption systems with smoother potential energy surfaces . at the latest for reactions with high degree of exothermicity dedicated calculations explicitly accounting for high - dimensional potential energy surfaces including substrate mobility at best in the form of moving surface atoms",
    "are required to establish the mechanistic details .",
    "these details can still be very important not only in light of fundamental understanding but also for coarse - grained micro - kinetic models @xcite .",
