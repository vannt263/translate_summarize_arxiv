    "the knowledge of distances to galaxies is important to deduce intrinsic galaxy properties ( absolute magnitude , size , etc . ) from the observed properties ( colours , sizes , angles , flux , apparent size , etc . ) .",
    "+ since pioneering works measuring redshift of bright galaxies ( e.g. , ( @xcite , @xcite ) , many efforts have been invested in mapping the light and matter in the universe .",
    "statistical analysis of galaxy properties and systems can be invaluable tools to study large - scale structure and evolution in the universe .",
    "+ in recent years , multi - band photometry has been performed for several millions of galaxies , whereas spectroscopic redshifts have been measured only for a small fraction of the photometric data .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey has obtained multi - band images for approximately one hundred billion galaxies ( and the next surveys foresee increasing the number of objects up to billions ) , while spectroscopic measurements have been obtained for nearly one million galaxies . a solution to",
    "the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts relies on the use of photometric redshift techniques .",
    "although the redshifts calculated through these techniques are far less accurate than the spectroscopic measurements , these approximate distance estimates allow for useful analysis in fields such as extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology .    two basic family of methods",
    "are commonly employed to calculate photometric redshifts . in the template",
    "matching approach , a set of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates is fitted to the observations ( e.g. , colours ) . in the empirical approach , on the other side , photometric redshifts are obtained from a large and representative training set of galaxies with both photometry and precise redshift estimations .",
    "the advantage of the first method is that it can also provide additional information , like the spectral type , k - corrections and absolute magnitudes .",
    "the accuracy of these estimations is limited by the sed models .",
    "the empirical model overcomes this limitation through the use of a training set which , however , should be large and representative enough to provide accurate redshift estimations",
    ". + the observed spectral energy distribution of distant galaxies is redshifted with respect to that in the galaxy rest frame .",
    "the k - correction term @xcite applied to the apparent magnitude measured in a given photometric band takes into account this effect , allowing to compare photometric properties of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "the estimation of k - corrections , then , is a requirement for many studies of distant galaxies .",
    "it is possible to model k - corrections as a function of redshift and galaxy morphological type @xcite . @xcite and @xcite use anns to obtain morphological classification of galaxies .",
    "however , these techniques employ as training sets , objects that had been classified by human eye subject to some degree of ambiguity and uncertainty , particularly at large redshifts .    a more direct way to obtain k - corrections",
    "is by modelling galaxy seds as a function of wavelength . usually template fitting of observed galaxy fluxes is employed to reconstruct the sed of the galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the feasibility and accuracy of this method relies in the quality of the models .    for objects with spectral data , k - corrections",
    "can also be obtained directly .",
    "@xcite used this technique to calculate k - corrections for early - type galaxies from the sdss - dr6 , providing individual estimates for each galaxy .",
    "however , this technique is restricted to a limited number of galaxies with spectroscopy .",
    "recent works ( @xcite , @xcite ) have approximated k - corrections with analytical functions of redshift , parametrized with some property characterizing galaxy type .",
    "@xcite used different observed colour indices to approximate k - corrections for nine filters ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite used spectra from the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey to obtain direct measurements of k - corrections by parametrization with the ratio of the average flux red and bluewards of the 4000 break ( @xmath10 ) . these kinds of parametrization simplify the computation of k - corrections and improve their accuracy .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a galaxy photometric redshift ( @xmath11 ) catalogue and a method for calculating k - corrections , for the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging catalogue ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to compute photometric redshifts we used the annz software package ( @xcite ) , which have been shown to be a reliable tool .",
    "there are also two sets of photometric redshifts in the sdss database : @xcite employ empirical , template - based and hybrid - techniques approaches to photometric redshift estimation , whereas @xcite adopt a neural network method and provide two different estimations , d1 and cc2 . here",
    "we also compare our redshift estimations with those in the cc2 catalogue from @xcite , which uses colours and concentration indices to infer redshifts . for the computation of k - corrections",
    "we propose a joint parametrization in terms of redshift and the @xmath6 colour in a certain reference frame for all sdss bands , as well as an algorithm to determine them from the photometric data .",
    "we compare our results with those found in literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data used in our analysis .",
    "section 3 presents our approach to calculate photometric redshifts in sdss - dr7 , analysing their advantages and limitations .",
    "our estimation of k - corrections is presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes the results obtained in this work .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmological model characterized by the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to compute k - corrections using the model described in the previous section , it is necessary to obtain reference - frames @xmath6 colours for each galaxy , which in turn depends on k - corrections .    to avoid this problem",
    "we have adopted an iterative procedure as follows : the iteration starts with an initial value for @xmath15 and @xmath16 according to the value of the concentration index of the galaxy in the r band ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this quantity does not depend on k - correction and is a suitable indicator of galaxy morphological type bimodality : early - type galaxies have higher @xmath17 than later types ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    according to @xcite ,",
    "@xmath18 values correspond to early - type galaxies , and late - type galaxies have @xmath19 .",
    "this bimodality can also be seen in the colour distribution of galaxies . in particular , the distribution of @xmath6 colours has two well - defined peaks : one at @xmath20 and other at @xmath21 , corresponding to the late and early - type components , respectively . taken these properties into account , we assign @xmath22 if @xmath19 and @xmath23",
    "if @xmath24 so that the initial @xmath15 and @xmath16 values are : @xmath25z+[a_{bl}(g - r)_{initial}+b_{bl}],\\ ] ] where @xmath26 refers to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ( see the dotted lines figure [ f4 ] )    once these initial values are fixed , we iterate in equation [ eq1 ] to obtain @xmath15 and @xmath16 for each galaxy . after each iteration , we check that the colours are within an acceptable range , @xmath27 in order to avoid either too red or too blue colours . in these cases",
    "the iteration starts again with a new @xmath28 value selected at random from a gaussian distribution ( within @xmath29 ) that fits either the blue or the red peak of the reference frame colour distribution .",
    "the iterations stop when the difference in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 between two consecutive steps is less than @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure converges in less than 15 iterations .    from the finally obtained @xmath15 and @xmath16 values we calculate the reference frame @xmath6 colours , which allows to compute k - corrections in the other bands using equation [ eq1 ] .",
    "we notice that there is a small percentage ( less than @xmath31 ) of galaxies for which our algorithm does not converge .",
    "howerver , the main sources for this lack of convergence are large magnitude uncertainties and unreliable observed colours(@xmath32 ) .",
    "the last colours constraints are helpful on removing stars with unusual colours , without discarding real galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite point out that the stellar contamination may still be present .",

    "we compute the k - corrections in all bands at extreme red and blue colours , finding that these estimates are within our range of calibrated values .",
    "we notice a difference in the @xmath38 for blue galaxies at higher redshift with respect to @xcite . we argue that this can be originated in the fact that these authors calibrate @xmath38 with the @xmath39 colour and that the @xmath40 filter has a natural red leak that cases abnormal @xmath39 colours .",

    "our estimates are shown as solid lines , and the dashed histogram is ` k - correct_v4.2 ` code @xcite results . for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath41 , both distributions are similar .",
    "as redshift increases , our distributions remain always unimodal , with a well defined mean . on the other hand , blanton s k - correction distribution shows 3 different maxima , one centered approximately in our distribution , and the others in the extremes .",
    "this behavior is probably indicative of template mismatch . at redshifts @xmath42 , both @xmath16",

    "[ f8 ] , we show the distribution of k - corrected absolute magnitudes in four different increasing redshift intervals ( key in figure ) .",
    "the shape of these distributions is very similar in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 sdss bands : a bell - shaped distribution skewed to fainter magnitudes .",

    "our best schechter fit corresponds to @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath0 band , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath1 band . where the errors had been obtained through bootstrapping .",
    "we notice that the luminosity functions at @xmath61 from our work and that of @xcite are consistent taking into account the @xmath62 values of typical sbc galaxies at this redshift @xcite .    in figure [ f10 ]",
    "we compare the @xmath6 colour distribution of galaxies brighter than @xmath63 in four redshift intervals .",
    "the dashed histogram corresponds to ` k - correct_v4.2 ` code results , and in solid lines we show our estimates . for galaxies with @xmath64 both distributions are similar , exhibiting a prominent red peak corresponding to early - type galaxies . as redshift increases , the distributions are shifted bluewards , and we notice in the redshift range @xmath65 an excess of red galaxies in @xcite results in comparison to ours .",
    "this trend can also be seen in the full redshift range ( figure [ f10 ] bottom right panel ) , where the galaxy bimodality can also be appreciated .    in figures [ f11 ] and [ f12 ]",

    "the shaded region represents the corresponding colour - colour diagram for @xmath71 of mgs , which have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the left upper panel ( @xmath72 ) shows that contours calculated for the photometric sample matches the shaded region . as the redshift increases , the contours in the colour - colour diagrams expand with respect to the spectroscopic sample , but both have approximately the same center .",
    "the expansion of the contours for the photometric results could be due to uncertainties in the determination of photometric redshifts and k - corrections , as well as they may reflect galaxy evolution .",
    "the colours show a decreasing trend for the red population as well as a constant shift to bluer colours ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly important for the redshift range @xmath65 .",

    "these additional inputs improve @xmath11 estimations because the concentration index provides information regarding the slope of the galaxy brightness profile , helping us to break the degeneracies in the redshift - colour relation due to morphology .",
    "the petrossian radius is a robust measure of how shallow the brightness profile is and contain information about the angular size , that is related to the distance .",
    "+ 2 ) the choice of different galaxy samples for the training set ( mgs , lrg and agn sample ) provides a wide sampling of different galaxy types at various redshifts , allowing to improve @xmath11 estimates .",
    "our @xmath11 estimates have a @xmath73 , and the resulting galaxy distribution shows a good agreement with the theoretical distribution derived from the sdss galaxy luminosity functions .    we have used the ` k - correct_v4.2 ` code ( @xcite ) for the mgs and we have performed a linear fit between reference frame @xmath6 colour and redshift , extrapolating this relation at high redshifts .",
    "we propose an iterative procedure to estimate k - corrections from the observed photometry in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "using initial values that depend on the concentration index and the observed colour , we obtain the k - correction for the other bands .",
    "our results show that the use of this simple linear relation between the reference frame @xmath6 colour and redshift is as accurate as those obtained in previous work .",
    "a clear plus of our approach is the low computational time .",
    "our k - correction estimations do not use templates , avoiding statistical errors in the lack of homogeneity in spectral features , and minimizing systematical errors caused by an assumed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this can be noticed in the smooth behavior of the distribution of k - corrections , even for intermediate redshifts .",
    "the analysis of the distribution of k - corrected absolute magnitudes show that the shape of these distributions has a bell - shaped skewed to fainter magnitudes and the mean of the distributions move towards fainter magnitudes as the redshift range decreases .",

    "this trend leads to the emergence of bimodality in the full redshift range . from the colour - colour diagrams",
    ", we can conclude that the behavior of colours at low redshift is in good agreement with the trends of the spectroscopic sample .",
