    "the abundance of cluster of galaxies is now well - established as a standard cosmological probe ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1991 ; jing & fang 1994 ; barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ) . in particular , several available x - ray catalogues of clusters have played an important role in placing fairly robust constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the spatial two - point correlation function of clusters is another important target for cosmological researches ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; klypin & kopylov 1983 ; bahcall 1988 ; bahcall & cen 1993 ; ueda , itoh & suto 1993 ; jing et al .",
    "1993 ; watanabe , matsubara & suto 1994 ; borgani , plionis , & kolokotronis 1999 ) .",
    "in fact the idea of biased galaxy formation by kaiser ( 1984 ) was proposed originally to reconcile the stronger spatial correlation of clusters with those of galaxies .",
    "the previous studies in this context , however , have been mainly based on the optically selected samples , which are likely to be contaminated by the projection effect and thus the selection function of which is difficult to evaluate precisely .",
    "the x - ray flux - limited catalogues of clusters are now becoming available with rosat ( e.g. ebeling et al . 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) and are expected to increase in their sample volume in near future with the x - ray satellites including astro - e , chandra , and xmm .",
    "such well - controlled catalogues are ideal to revisit the cluster correlation functions with unprecedented precision .",
    "the proper comparison with such data , however , requires better theoretical predictions which take account of the selection function of x - ray clusters ( kitayama , sasaki & suto 1998 ) , the luminosity and time dependent bias ( mo & white 1996 ; jing 1998 ; moscardini et al . 1998 ) , the light - cone effect ( matarrese et al .",
    "1997 ; matsubara , suto & szapudi 1997 ; nakamura , matsubara & suto 1998 ; yamamoto & suto 1999 ; moscardini et al .",
    "1999a ) and the redshift - space distortion ( hamilton 1998 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ; suto et al .",
    "1999 ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 ; yamamoto , nishioka & suto 1999 ; magira , jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "the theoretical prescriptions for those effects have been developed and become available recently .",
    "this motivates us to present detailed predictions for the two - point correlation functions for x - ray flux - limited samples of clusters of galaxies combining the cluster abundances in a fully consistent fashion .",
    "moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) recently performed a similar work , and our present paper differs from theirs in several aspects .",
    "first , we take account of the linear and nonlinear redshift - space distortion due to the peculiar velocity field .",
    "second we adopt a formula for the light - cone effect derived by yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) which is the one - dimensional integration over the redshift in the cluster sample . finally , we are mainly interested in future surveys which probe a higher redshift ( @xmath0 ) universe , and therefore focus on a range of the x - ray flux limit a few magnitudes fainter than they considered .",
    "koyama , soda & taruya ( 1999 ) suggested a presence of primordial non - gaussianity from the combined analysis of the cosmic microwave background , the abundance of x - ray clusters at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the correlation length of optical cluster samples . while this interpretation is interesting , the definite conclusion requires the proper account of the selection effect as well as the theoretical modeling and the statistical limitation of the available sample . in this sense , optically selected cluster samples currently available are still far from satisfactory , and the analysis of the upcoming x - ray selected catalogues is essential .",
    "the observable two - point correlation functions are inevitably distorted due to the presence of the peculiar velocity field .",
    "we take into account this redshift - space distortion following cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , magira et al.(2000 ) and yamamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "our key assumption is that the bias of the cluster density field relative to the mass density field is linear and scale - independent : @xmath3 in this case , the power spectrum of the corresponding cluster samples in redshift space is well approximated as @xmath4 ^ 2   \\left[b_{\\rm cl}(z)\\right]^2~ p^{\\rm r}_{\\rm mass}(k , z ) , \\label{eq : pkcl2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 the direction cosine of the wavenumber vector and the line - of - sight of the fiducial observer , and @xmath6 is the mass power spectrum in real space .",
    "the numerator in equation ( [ eq : pkcl2d ] ) expresses the linear redshift - space distortion ( kaiser 1987 ) , where @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the linear growth factor normalized to be unity at present .",
    "the denominator in equation ( [ eq : pkcl2d ] ) takes account of the nonlinear redshift - space distortion ( _ finger - of - god _ ) assuming that the one - point distribution function of the peculiar velocity is exponential with the velocity dispersion of @xmath10 .    averaging equation ( [ eq : pkcl2d ] ) over the angle with respect to the line - of - sight of the observer yields @xmath11    \\left[b_{\\rm cl}(z)\\right]^2~ p^{\\rm r}_{\\rm mass}(k , z )   \\\\",
    "a(\\kappa ) & = & { { \\rm arctan}(\\kappa/\\sqrt{2})\\over \\sqrt{2}\\kappa}+    { 1\\over 2+\\kappa^2 } , \\\\",
    "b(\\kappa ) & = & { 6\\over\\kappa^2}\\biggl(a(\\kappa)-{2\\over 2+\\kappa^2}\\biggr ) , \\\\",
    "c(\\kappa ) & = & { -10\\over\\kappa^2}\\biggl(b(\\kappa)-{2\\over 2+\\kappa^2}\\biggr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 . finally the corresponding two - point correlation function of clusters in redshift space is computed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spherical bessel function . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt nonlinear evolution of the mass fluctuations using the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ; pd ) fitting formula for @xmath6 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function of galaxy clusters at @xmath15 is determined to a good precision from existing observational catalogues ( burns et al .",
    "1996 ; ebeling et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , the press - schechter theory applied to the cdm models reproduces quite well the x - ray luminosity function , as well as the x - ray temperature function , provided that the amplitude of the mass fluctuation at @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is related to the density parameter @xmath18 and the cosmological constant @xmath19 as follows ( kitayama & suto 1997 ; see also viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) : @xmath20 in this paper , we follow the prescription of kitayama & suto ( 1997 ) to relate the mass @xmath21 of the `` press - schechter objects '' to the x - ray luminosity @xmath22 ( bolometric or band - limited ) of the real clusters of galaxies .",
    "although the one - to - one correspondence of those two species is a non - trivial assumption , it is regarded as a fairly successful approximation , at least empirically .",
    "we first relate the total mass @xmath21 of the dark halo of a cluster to the temperature of hot gas , @xmath23 , assuming the virial equilibrium : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 is the gravitational constant , @xmath27 is the proton mass , @xmath5 is the mean molecular weight ( we adopt @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is a fudge factor of order unity ( we adopt @xmath30 ) . in the above , @xmath31 is the redshift of the cluster which we assume is equal to the cluster formation epoch for simplicity ( see kitayama & suto 1996 for more discussion on this point ) .",
    "while the cluster temperature may not be isothermal , it is not important in our analysis .",
    "in fact , the above temperature should be interpreted as an average temperature of the cluster .",
    "in fact , our latest hydrodynamical simulations ( yoshikawa , jing & suto 1999 ) show that the mass- and emission - weighted temperatures of simulated clusters satisfy the above relation with @xmath30 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "further details of the temperature - mass relation and its non - isothermal effect are discussed in makino , sasaki & suto ( 1998 ) , yoshikawa , itoh , & suto ( 1998 ) , suto , sasaki & makino ( 1999 ) and yoshikawa & suto ( 1999 ) .",
    "we compute @xmath33 , the ratio of the mean cluster density to the mean density of the universe at that epoch using the formulae for the spherical collapse model presented in kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) .",
    "next we transform the temperature to the luminosity of clusters using the _ observed _ luminosity  temperature relation : @xmath34 while a simple theory on the basis of the self - similar cluster evolution predicts the slope @xmath35 , we adopt @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the basis of recent observational indications ( e.g. , david et al . 1993 ; ebeling et al . 1996 ; ponman et al . 1996 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) . then we translate @xmath39 into the band - limited luminosity @xmath40 $ ] as @xmath41 = l_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle bol}}(t_{{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle gas}}})\\times    f[t_{{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle gas}}},e_a(1+z),e_b(1+z ) ] , \\label{eq : band}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] is the band correction factor which takes account of metal line emissions ( masai 1984 ) in addition to the thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "finally the source luminosity @xmath43 at @xmath31 is converted to the observed flux @xmath44 in an x - ray energy band [ @xmath45,@xmath46 : @xmath47 = { l_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle band}}[e_a(1+z),e_b(1+z ) ] \\over 4 \\pi d_{{\\scriptscriptstyle l}}^2(z ) } \\label{eq : ls}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the luminosity distance . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we use the @xmath49kev band for the flux assuming the abundance of intracluster gas as 0.3 times the solar value .",
    "the luminosity distance is related to the comoving distance @xmath50 and the angular diameter distance @xmath51 as @xmath52 ; @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the radial distance : @xmath55 and @xmath56 the hubble parameter at redshift",
    "@xmath31 : @xmath57    in what follows , we mainly consider three representative models ; scdm ( standard cdm ) with @xmath58 @xmath59 , lcdm ( lambda cdm ) with @xmath60 , and ocdm ( open cdm ) with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the hubble constant @xmath63 in units of @xmath64km / s / mpc .",
    "it should be noted that equation ( [ eq : s8o0 ] ) is valid for @xmath65 , strictly speaking .",
    "for that reason , we adopt @xmath66 , instead of @xmath67 , to match the cluster abundance for scdm with @xmath68 .",
    "the relations among mass , temperature , luminosity and flux of x - ray clusters which we describe in the above do not depend on the power spectrum .",
    "for definiteness , however , we choose the same cosmological parameters as the above three models , and plot the results .",
    "figure [ fig : tlm ] shows the temperature @xmath69 and the bolometric luminosity @xmath70 , as a function of cluster mass @xmath21 at @xmath71 ( dashed lines ) , 0.5 ( dotted lines ) and 1.0 ( solid lines ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tmsx ] plots @xmath69 and @xmath21 as a function of x - ray flux @xmath72 for clusters at @xmath71 ( dashed lines ) , 0.5 ( dotted lines ) and 1.0 ( solid lines ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tlmz ] shows @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath21 of clusters at @xmath31 with the observed x - ray flux @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75erg / s/@xmath76 in solid , dotted and dashed curves , respectively .      in order to complete a model for @xmath77 , the two - point correlation function of x - ray clusters on a constant - time hypersurface at @xmath31 , one has to specify a model for bias . here we adopt a fitting formula for bias of jing ( 1998 ) , which improves an original proposal by mo & white ( 1996 ) on the basis of high - resolution n - body simulations : @xmath78^{0.06 - 0.02n_{\\rm eff } }   \\left[1 - { 1\\over\\delta_c } + { \\delta_c\\over\\delta^2(m , z)}\\right ] .\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath79 is the density fluctuation smoothed over a ( top - hat ) mass scale of @xmath21 at the redshift @xmath31 , @xmath80 is the effective slope of the linear density power spectrum at the mass scale @xmath21 ( see jing 1998 ) , @xmath81 is the critical density contrast for the spherical collapse . to be specific , jing ( 1998 )",
    "carried out several simulations in four scale - free models and three representative cdm models employing @xmath82 particles .",
    "each model is simulated with three or four different realizations .",
    "the dark matter halos are identified using the friends - of - friends algorithm using the linking length of 0.2 times the mean particle separation .",
    "thus the above formula ( [ eq : biasjing ] ) applies for the virialized dark halo defined according to the press ",
    "schechter theory , and is appropriate for the clusters of galaxies .    combining the results in the previous subsection",
    ", we translate the above bias factor into a function of x - ray flux limit according to @xmath83 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the press ",
    "schechter mass function . given the flux limit @xmath85 , the corresponding luminosity @xmath86 for a cluster located at @xmath31",
    "is computed from equation ( [ eq : ls ] ) with the luminosity distance @xmath87",
    ". then we solve equations ( [ eq : lt ] ) and ( [ eq : band ] ) for @xmath88 , and finally obtain @xmath89 using equation ( [ eq : tm ] ) .    figure [ fig : biasmsx ] plots the evolution of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for our model of x - ray clusters . as noted in figure 3 of jing ( 1998 ) , the fitting formula is accurate within 10 percent for @xmath94 on linear scales .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the fit using the more recent numerical simulations , and made sure that the fit is accurate better than 20 percent even at @xmath95 . in any case , the fraction of such massive clusters is significantly smaller according to equation ( [ eq : psmass ] ) , and the difference of the fit and simulations to that level hardly changes our results in reality .",
    "we should note here , however , that the bias factor becomes scale - dependent for scales below @xmath96 , and then our assumption of linear and scale - independent bias breaks down .",
    "thus while our predictions on linear scales @xmath97 , which we are mostly interested in , are reliable , those on smaller scales should be interpreted simply to show the various effects qualitatively .",
    "the two - point correlation function on the light - cone is properly formulated by yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) . in the present context ,",
    "their formula yields the following expression for the two - point correlation functions of clusters brighter than the x - ray flux - limit @xmath85 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the comoving separation of a pair of clusters , @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the redshift range of the survey , and @xmath102 is the corresponding two - point correlation function on a constant - time hypersurface at @xmath31 in redshift space ( eq.[[eq : xiscl ] ] ) .",
    "the comoving number density of clusters in the flux - limited survey , @xmath103 , is computed by integrating the press ",
    "schechter mass function as @xmath104 finally the comoving volume element per unit solid angle is @xmath105 while equation ( [ eq : lcxir1 ] ) was originally derived for the cosmological models with flat spatial geometry ( yamamoto & suto 1999 ) , we assume that the formula is valid for the cosmological models with open geometry . note also that this expression for the light - cone effect looks rather different from that adopted by mataresse et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , but that both lead to fairly similar results quantitatively ; see yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) for detailed comparison and discussion .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : lcxir1 ] ) is useful in making theoretical predictions , but @xmath106 itself is not directly observable ( unless the cosmological parameters are specified ) .",
    "instead it can be rewritten in terms of the redshift distribution of clusters per unit solid angle with an x - ray flux @xmath107 : @xmath108 and @xmath109 which is related to @xmath106 as @xmath110    figure [ fig : dndz ] plots the redshift distribution function for x - ray flux - limited clusters with @xmath111 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 erg / s/@xmath76 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath89 corresponding to a fixed @xmath85 _ decreases _ for @xmath112 .",
    "in fact this behavior is understood from equations ( [ eq : tm ] ) to ( [ eq : ls ] ) ; @xmath113 .",
    "while our predictions based on the modeling described in the previous section include various important effects , it would be instructive to discuss them separately first . for that purpose ,",
    "we plot in figure [ fig : xicl_diff ] several different predictions for two - point correlation functions in which some of the effects are artificially turned off ; linear and nonlinear mass correlations in real space at @xmath1 using the bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ; bbks ) and pd formulae for mass power spectra , cluster correlations with linear redshift - space distortion ( kaiser 1987 ) and with full redshift - space distortion , at @xmath1 using the fitting formula of mo , jing & brner ( 1997 ) to compute @xmath114 . these should be compared with our final predictions on the light - cone in redshift space ( eq.[[eq : xiscl ] ] ) .",
    "the qualitative features illustrated in figure [ fig : xicl_diff ] can be understood as the combination of the following effects ; the nonlinear gravitational evolution increases the correlation on small scales , while redshift - space distortion decreases ( enhances ) the amplitudes on small ( large ) scales . the correlation length defined by eq.[[eq : rc0 ] ] below , for inscance , is enhanced in redshift space by 50 percent for scdm and 20 percent for lcdm and ocdm in comparison with those in real space .",
    "the light - cone effect averages the amplitude over a range of redshift which is generally expected to decrease the correlation _ if _ the clustering amplitude at higher @xmath31 decreases according to linear theory . in reality , however , @xmath115 increases more rapidly than the linear growth rate @xmath9 at higher @xmath31 , and therefore the clustering amplitude evaluated on the light cone for a given @xmath85 increases as @xmath31 ( see fig.[fig : rc0_zmax ] below ) .",
    "nevertheless this is not what we observe in a flux - limited survey .",
    "if the survey flux - limit @xmath85 becomes smaller , the sample includes both less luminous clusters at low @xmath31 and more luminous clusters at high @xmath31 .",
    "while the latter shows stronger bias , the former should exhibit weaker bias . thus averaging over the light - cone volume , their effect on the overall clustering amplitude",
    "is fairly compensated .",
    "this explains why the overall results are not so sensitive to @xmath85 as shown in left panels of figure [ fig : xicl_sxtl ] .",
    "if the temperature of an individual cluster in an x - ray flux - limited sample is determined observationally , one can construct a temperature - limited subsample .",
    "similarly one can construct a luminosity - limited subsample from the flux - limited sample with the redshift information of each cluster . if the underlying luminosity  temperature relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : lt ] ] ) had no dispersion , these two subsamples would be essentially the same . in reality , however , the finite amount of the dispersions would lead to different predictions for those subsamples , which will provide further and independent information on the cluster models .",
    "this is particularly the case here since the bias is highly sensitive to the mass , and therefore to the temperature and luminosity , of a cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : xicl_sxtl ] shows our predictions for @xmath116 for cluster samples selected with different flux - limit @xmath117 ( _ left panels _ ) , and with temperature and absolute bolometric luminosity limits , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( _ middle and right panels _ ) . for the latter two cases , @xmath120erg / s/@xmath76 is assumed for definiteness .",
    "as explained in the previous subsection , the results are insensitive to @xmath117 , but very sensitive to @xmath118 and @xmath119 , reflecting the strong dependence of the bias on the latter quantities .    to see this in a somewhat different manner , we plot in figure [ fig : rc0_sxtl ] the correlation length @xmath121 defined through @xmath122 as a function of @xmath85 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for the latter two cases ,",
    "@xmath123erg / s/@xmath76 is assumed as in figure [ fig : xicl_sxtl ] .",
    "again it is clear that the results are fairly insensitive to @xmath85 , but are sensitive to the bias factor , which results in the strong dependence of @xmath124 on @xmath125 and @xmath119 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 also depends on the depth of the survey via the light - cone effect and the evolution of bias and mass fluctuations ( fig.[fig : rc0_zmax ] ) . as a result of the several competing effects , @xmath121 increases , albeit very weakly , as @xmath126 becomes larger .      for a cosmological application of the present result",
    ", it is interesting to examine how the @xmath127 depends on @xmath18 .",
    "this is summarized in figure [ fig : rc0_omega0 ] , where we fix the value of the fluctuation amplitude @xmath17 adopting the cluster abundance constraint ( eq.[[eq : s8o0 ] ] ) , and consider both @xmath128 ( thick lines ) and @xmath129 ( thin lines ) .",
    "we set the shape parameter of the spectrum @xmath130 as @xmath131 $ ] with @xmath132 and @xmath65 .",
    "if we adopt such spectra , the correlation length in @xmath128 model is generally larger than that in @xmath129 model , largely reflecting the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath19 ( eq.[[eq : s8o0 ] ] ) .",
    "again the results are not sensitive to the flux limit @xmath85 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath18 is rather strong , and these predictions combined with the future observational results will be able to break the degeneracy of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we have presented a detailed methodology to predict the two - point correlation functions for x - ray flux - limited samples of clusters of galaxies , fully taking into account the redshift - space distortion , nonlinear gravitational evolution of mass fluctuations , evolution of bias , the light - cone effect and the observational selection function . while our method is similar to the recent model of moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) in many respects , the most important difference is that we incorporated both linear and nonlinear redshift - space distortion following the prescription of suto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , yamamoto , nishioka & suto ( 1999 ) and magira , jing & suto ( 2000 ) .",
    "the predictions for correlations of clusters are most sensitive to the model of bias among others .",
    "fortunately , the press  schechter theory provides a quite reliable bias model for clusters ( mo & white 1996 ; jing 1998 ) , which is in marked contrast with a model for galaxy and quasar bias .",
    "thus one can make quantitative and detailed model predictions once a set of the cosmological parameters are specified .",
    "these predictions can be checked against the flux - limited samples of clusters from the future x - ray satellites including astro - e , chandra , and xmm .",
    "it is particularly interesting to probe the value of @xmath18 and the degree of non - gaussianity by combining this comparison and the cluster abundance ( kitayama , sasaki , & suto 1998 ; koyama , soda , & taruya 1999 ) .",
    "we should note , however , that the current methodology is reliable only for linear scales ; on small scales ( @xmath133 ) , the approximation of the linear and scale - independent bias breaks down .",
    "in addition , the projection effect becomes inevitably important below a few scales even for the x - ray selected samples , and the observational data analysis itself becomes non - trivial .",
    "while the selection function for the future survey would not exactly match those in our examples , it is straightforward to make suitable predictions on the basis of the present formalism at least on linear scales , and we hope that we have already presented all the basic and qualitative features of the clustering statistics .    after submitting this paper , moscardini et al .",
    "( 1999b ) posted a quite similar paper on the clustering of x - ray selected galaxy clusters .",
    "they predicted the correlation lengths at @xmath134erg / s/@xmath76 of 7 and 12 in scdm and lcdm models , respectively ( their fig.7 ) , which should be compared with our predictions of 9 and 17 ( fig.[fig : rc0_sxtl ] ) .",
    "while our models adopt slightly different values for the shape parameter @xmath130 , and the normalization of fluctuations , @xmath17 , it is clear that our correlation lengths are systematically larger by @xmath135 percent level .",
    "this should be ascribed to be the redshift - distortion effect which they neglect in their analysis .",
    "in fact , this difference is comparable to the cosmological model dependence which they showed in their figure 7 , clearly suggesting the importance of the effect to this level . apart from this difference ,",
    "however , our results are consistent with each other .",

    "<S> we have developed a model to describe two - point correlation functions of clusters of galaxies in x - ray flux - limited surveys . </S>",
    "<S> our model properly takes account of nonlinear gravitational evolution of mass fluctuations , redshift - space distortion due to linear peculiar velocity field and to finger - of - god , cluster abundance and bias evolution on the basis of the press  schechter theory , the light - cone effect , and the selection function due to the x - ray flux , temperature and luminosity limits . applying this model in representative cosmological models , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented quantitative predictions for x - ray selected samples feasible from the future surveys with the x - ray satellites including astro - e , chandra , and xmm . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of these predictions and the observed cluster clustering will place important cosmological constraints which are complementary to the cluster abundance and the cosmic microwave background .    </S>",
