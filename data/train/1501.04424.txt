    "many extensions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite assume that dark matter ( dm ) is made up of new particles charged under some new interaction mediated by a new gauge vector boson called @xmath4 ( also referred to as dark photon or a ) .",
    "the @xmath4 boson can kinetically mix with the ordinary photon through high - order diagrams , providing therefore a small coupling with sm particles  @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength can be expressed by a single factor , @xmath11 , equal to the ratio of dark and standard model electromagnetic couplings  @xcite . a @xmath4 boson with mass of @xmath12(1gev ) and @xmath11 in the range 10 - 2;10 - 7 ; could explain all puzzling effects observed in recent astrophysics experiments  @xcite . by using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 239  pb-1 ; , kloe investigated the the radiative @xmath4 production with @xmath13 .",
