    "the aim of this work is to develop the framework for the description of low - energy positron annihilation on molecules , and to analyse its two main mechanisms : direct and resonant annihilation .",
    "there are a number of remarkable phenomena associated with this process : very large annihilation rates @xcite , high sensitivity of the rates to small changes in the molecular structure @xcite , large ionization - fragmentation cross sections for organic molecules at sub - ps - threshold positron energies @xcite , and rapid increase of the fragmentation and annihilation rates towards small positron energies @xcite . in spite of decades of study",
    ", there is no consistent physical picture or even general understanding of these processes , and there have been very few calculations @xcite , which leaves too much room for speculations @xcite .",
    "my main objective is to consider real mechanisms of positron annihilation on molecules , describe their characteristic features , make estimates of the corresponding annihilation rates , and formulate the terms in which positron - molecule annihilation should be described and analysed .",
    "in recent work @xcite , iwata _",
    "_ describe new experiments to study positron annihilation on molecules .",
    "some of these experiments test specific features of the annihilation processes described in the present paper .",
    "though some aspects of the experimental work are discussed here , futher details and comparison with theory and various models of positron annihilation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the annihilation rate @xmath5 for positrons in a molecular or atomic gas is usually expressed in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath0 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the classical radius of the electron , @xmath8 is the non - relativistic spin - averaged rate of electron - positron annihilation into two @xmath9 quanta , and @xmath10 is the number density of molecules @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : zeff ] ) implies that @xmath0 is the effective number of target electrons contributing to the annihilation process . in terms of the annihilation cross section @xmath11",
    "the rate is @xmath12 , so by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeff ] ) , we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the positron velocity . accordingly , the spin - averaged cross section of annihilation of a non - relativistic positron on a single electron corresponds to @xmath15 , see e.g. @xcite . if the annihilation occurs during binary positron - molecule collisions , as in the experiments of the san diego group @xcite who use a positron trap and work at low gas densities , the parameter @xmath0 is independent of the density .",
    "it characterizes the annihilation of a positron on a single molecule .",
    "one could expect that @xmath0 is comparable to the number of electrons @xmath16 in an atom or molecule .",
    "moreover , low - energy positrons do not penetrate deep into the atom , and annihilate most probably with the valence electrons only .",
    "however , even for hydrogen @xmath17 at low energies @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of correlation effects .",
    "the most important of them is polarization of the atom by the positron and , as a result , an attractive @xmath18 positron - atom potential , @xmath19 being the atomic dipole polarizability .",
    "an additional short - range contribution to the positron - atom attraction comes from virtual ps formation , i.e. , hopping , or rather , tunneling of an electron between the atomic ion and the positron . the electron density on the positron is also enhanced due to the coulomb attraction between them .",
    "these effects make atomic @xmath0 large , e.g. , @xmath20 for room temperature positrons on xe @xcite .",
    "even compared with this large number , annihilation rates for low - energy ( room temperature ) positrons on polyatomic molecules are huge .",
    "they increase very rapidly with the molecular size , and depend strongly on the chemical composition of the molecules , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zeffmol ] .",
    "this has been known for quite a while , after early measurements for ccl@xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite , butane , @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath0 ranging between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for large alkanes c@xmath26h@xmath27 , @xmath28416 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the largest @xmath0 values measured so far are @xmath29 for antracene c@xmath30h@xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 for sebacic acid dimethyl ester c@xmath33h@xmath34o@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus , while @xmath0 up to five orders of magnitude greater than @xmath16 have been observed , the physical processes responsible for these anomalously large annihilation rates have not been really understood . in other words , if the observed @xmath0 are parametrically large , compared to the number of available electrons , then what are the parameters that determine large annihilation rates for positrons on molecules ?    in this work",
    "i consider two basic mechanisms of positron - molecule annihilation .",
    "the first mechanism is _ direct annihilation _ of the incoming positron with one of the molecular electrons .",
    "the contribution of this mechanism to the annihilation rate is proportional to the number of valence electrons available for annihilation .",
    "it can be enhanced by the positron - molecule interaction which distorts the positron wave .",
    "in particular , the positron density in the vicinity of the molecule increases greatly if a low - lying virtual state ( @xmath35 ) or a weakly bound level ( @xmath36 ) exists for the @xmath37-wave positron . in this case",
    "@xmath38 for small positron energies @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this type of enhancement is responsible for large @xmath0 values observed in heavier noble gas atoms , where successively lower virtual levels exist for the positron ( @xmath40 , 90.1 and 401 for ar , kr and xe , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "this understanding is confirmed by the temperature dependences of the annihilation rates measured for the noble gases in @xcite .",
    "note that for room - temperature positrons , @xmath41 , even for @xmath42 the size of the enhancement due to virtual / weakly bound states is limited .",
    "the second mechanism is _ resonant annihilation_. by this i mean a two - stage process .",
    "the positron is first captured into a feshbach - type resonance , where positron attachment is accompanied by excitation of some molecular degrees of freedom .",
    "such process is well known for electrons @xcite .",
    "the positron in the quasi bound state then annihilates with a molecular electron .",
    "enhancement of annihilation due to a single resonance was considered theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of forming such resonances by excitation of the vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules was proposed by surko _",
    "@xcite to explain high annihilation rates and their strong dependence on the molecular size observed for alkanes .",
    "it was also considered in relation to the problem of fragmentation of molecules by positron annihilation @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution to the annihilation have never been properly evaluated . to make this mechanism work for low - energy positrons",
    "one must assumed that positrons can form bound states with large neutral molecules , i.e. , the positron affinity of the molecule is positive , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the capture is then possible if the energy of the incoming positron is in resonance with the vibrationally excited state of the positron - molecule complex @xcite .",
    "the density of the vibrational excitation spectrum of this complex can be high , even if the excitation energy supplied by positron binding , @xmath44 , is only few tenths of an ev ( it is reasonable to assume that the presence of the positron does not change the vibrational spectrum of the molecule by too much ) . for positrons with thermal maxwellian energy distribution",
    "the contribution of the resonant annihilation mechanism averaged over a number of resonances @xmath45 is observed .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath45 is determined by three parameters of the positron - molecule resonant states : their annihilation width @xmath46 , the autodetachment width @xmath47 , which also determines the probability of positron capture , and the level density @xmath48 of the positron - molecule resonant states populated in positron capture .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath46 for positron - molecule bound states is comparable to the spin - averaged annihilation width of the ps atom ( @xmath49  s ) .",
    "note that @xmath46 does not increase with the size of the molecule , because the increase in the number of electrons is accompanied by thinning of the positron density in the ( quasi)bound positron - molecule state .",
    "it turns out ( see sec . [",
    "sec : anmech ] ) that for @xmath50 the magnitude of @xmath45 is simply proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "this density increases rapidly with the size of the molecule , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of vibrational modes , @xmath53 is the effective number of vibrational quanta excited in positron capture , and @xmath54 is a typical molecular vibrational frequency .",
    "thus , the resonant annihilation mechanism can explain the rapid increase of @xmath0 with the size of the molecule shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeffmol ] .",
    "moreover , my estimates show that for thermal positrons @xmath45 up to @xmath55 could be observed .",
    "a necessary condition for the resonant annihilation to occur is the existence of positron - molecule bound states . until recently there was almost no positive information about the possibility of positron binding to neutral atomic species .",
    "the experimental results and their interpretation by surko _",
    "@xcite could be viewed as the strongest , albeit indirect , evidence of positron binding to large molecules .",
    "this situation has changed now .",
    "many - body theory calculations of dzuba _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicated strongly that positrons can be bound by mg , zn , cd , and hg and , possibly , many other atoms .",
    "recently the variational calculations of ryzhikh and mitroy proved rigorously that positrons form bound states with li atoms , and demonstrated that bound states also exist for na , be , mg , zn , cu and ag @xcite .",
    "molecules are much larger potential wells for the positron , and it seems natural that many of them should be capable of binding positrons .",
    "ideas about different mechanisms in positron - molecule annihilation have been discussed earlier in a number of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works . however , there is a need to re - examine this question using a unified approach to the annihilation mechanisms , and define clearly the physical variables which determine the observed annihilation rates .",
    "the latter is especially important for the present work which aims to provide understanding of a whole variety of phenomena , including the origins of the high values of @xmath0 for molecules and their dependence on the chemical composition and positron energy .",
    "in this section a derivation of the positron annihilation rate within a standard scattering theory formalism is presented .",
    "i show how to estimate the contributions of the direct and resonant mechanisms , and examine specific features of these mechanisms .",
    "the effective number of electrons @xmath0 related to the annihilation rate through eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeff ] ) is determined by the positron density on the electrons @xmath56 where @xmath16 is the number of target electrons , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the coordinates of the electrons and positron , respectively , and @xmath59 is the total wave function of the system .",
    "it describes scattering of the positron with initial momentum @xmath60 from the atomic or molecular target in the ground state @xmath61 , and is normalized as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radius of the target ( atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "note that for molecular targets @xmath64 and @xmath61 should , strictly speaking , depend on the nuclear coordinates as well .",
    "let us first assume that the electron - positron degrees of freedom are completely decoupled from the nuclear motion .",
    "the scattering wave function is then determined by the positron interaction with the charge distribution of the ground - state target and electron - positron correlation interaction ( polarization of the target , virtual ps formation , etc . ) .",
    "let us denote the corresponding wave function @xmath65 . at positron energies of a few electron volts",
    "the molecule can be excited electronically , and the positron may find itself trapped in electronically excited feshbach resonance states .",
    "this may result in rapid resonant energy dependence of the @xmath65 wave function .",
    "however , at small sub - ev or room - temperature positron energies electron excitations can not be produced , and @xmath65 behaves smoothly .",
    "on the other hand , if the positron affinity of a molecule is positive , the system ` molecule@xmath66positron ' is capable of forming a stable `` positronic ion '' , whose lifetime is only limited by positron annihilation .",
    "this system will also have a number of excited bound states @xmath67 corresponding to vibrational excitations of the positron - molecule complex .",
    "their typical energies are of the order of 0.1 ev and smaller , as determined by the vibrational spectrum of the molecule .",
    "if we now turn on the coupling @xmath68 between the electron - positron and nuclear degrees of freedom the total scattering wave function will be given by @xmath69 the first term on the right - hand side describes direct , or _",
    "@xcite , scattering of the positron by the ground - state molecule .",
    "the second term describes positron capture into bound positron - molecule states .",
    "equation ( [ eq : totpsi ] ) has the appearance of a standard perturbation - theory formula .",
    "the energy of the system is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the target ground state energy .",
    "the energies of the positron - molecule ( quasi)bound states @xmath67 in the denominator are complex , @xmath72 , because these states are , in fact , unstable against positron annihilation with one of the target electrons , and against positron emission , a process inverse to positron capture .",
    "therefore , the total width of state @xmath73 is the sum of the annihilation and emission ( or capture ) widths : @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "these states manifest as resonances in positron - molecule scattering",
    ". they may not give a sizeable contribution to the scattering cross section , but , as i show below , they can contribute a lot to the positron - molecule annihilation rate .",
    "the contribution of a particular resonant state @xmath73 to the wave function is proportional to the corresponding capture amplitude @xmath75 , which also determines the capture width @xmath76 where the latter formula is valid for the positron @xmath37 wave which dominates at low positron energies ( see below ) . if the positron interaction with vibrations can not be described by perturbations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : totpsi ] ) and ( [ eq : gamc ] ) remain valid , provided we replace the first - order capture amplitudes @xmath75 with their non - perturbative values .",
    "the annihilation width of the positron - molecule state @xmath67 is a product of the spin - averaged electron - positron annihilation cross section @xmath77 , the positron velocity @xmath14 , and the density factor , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the average positron density on the target electrons in the @xmath80th bound state . for the ground state positronium @xmath81 .",
    "one can use this value to estimate the annihilation width of the positron - molecule complex .",
    "the presence of many electrons in a large molecule does not lead to an increase of the width , because the positron is spread over a larger volume due to the normalization condition @xmath82 therefore , using the ps estimate of the density one obtains @xmath83 a.u .",

    "due to positron repulsion from the atomic nuclei the low - energy positron does not penetrate deep inside the atomic system .",

    "this takes place `` on the surface '' of the atomic system , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : out ] ) essentially determines the amplitude of finding the positron there . of course ,",
    "due to short - range electron - positron correlations the true wave function at small distances can not be factorized similarly to eq .",

    "the coulomb interaction between the positron and electron increases the probability of finding both at the same point in space , as required by the @xmath95-function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeffpsi ] ) .",
    "this effect enhances the annihilation rate @xcite .",
    "however , since small distances and relatively large interactions are involved , these correlations do not depend on the momentum of the incoming positron at low energies . on the other hand , to participate in the annihilation event the positron must first approach the target , and this is described by eq .",

    "the latter is simply equal to the @xmath37-wave scattering amplitude .",

    "however , even in the form ( [ eq : zdir1 ] ) the electron density @xmath103 and the overlap @xmath99 are effective parameters , and the accurate value of the pre - factor can only be found by comparison with numerical calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : illdir ] ) . nevertheless , eq . ( [ eq : zdir1 ] ) is very useful for the analysis of direct annihilation .",

    "averaging is then reduced to the integral over the breit - wigner resonant profiles .",
    "the number of resonances within @xmath129 is @xmath132 .",

    "it is easy to see that the resonant contribution could also be derived from standard resonant scattering theory developed originally to describe neutron scattering via compound nucleus resonances ( @xcite , ch .",
    "the maximal @xmath37-wave capture cross section is given by @xmath136 .",
    "the true capture cross section is smaller than @xmath137 , because the capture takes place only when the positron energy matches the energy of the resonance . for positrons with finite energy spread ( e.g. , thermal ones ) , the capture cross section is then @xmath138 , where @xmath126 is the mean energy spacing between the resonances .",
    "more accurately , @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "if we are concerned with the annihilation process , the capture cross section must be multiplied by the probability of annihilation , @xmath140 , which gives the energy - averaged resonance annihilation cross section @xmath141 where averaging over resonances similar to that in eq .",

    "the resonance mechanism shows that such large cross sections can be achieved for the annihilation process , in spite of the fact that it is suppressed by the relativistic factor @xmath161 , in atomic units [ see eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq : resres ] ) predicts unusual low - energy threshold behaviour @xmath162 ( the latter for thermal positrons ) . in a standard situation",
    "the cross section of an inelastic process involving a slow projectile in the initial state behaves as @xmath163 .",
    "this dependence is characteristic of the @xmath37 wave scattering , which dominates at low projectile energies , and is valid in the absence of long - range forces between the target and the projectile .",
    "it is known as the `` @xmath164 '' law , and its examples are numerous : from the @xmath165 nuclear reaction to dissociative electron attachment to molecules , where it is observed below 1 mev @xcite .",

    "this mechanism shows high sensitivity to the chemical composition of the target , and the size of the molecule .",
