    "high experimental precision attained in the laser spectroscopic measurement of the ground - state hfs in hydrogen - like @xmath4bi@xmath5 @xcite stimulates considerable theoretical activity in this field ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . @xmath6    the first quantum mechanical calculation of the hfs",
    "was made by fermi in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "he treated the hfs with a non - relativistic formalism in studies of alkali atoms , where he derived approximate generalizations from the hydrogenic case . in the case of @xmath4bi@xmath5",
    "the formulae obtained by fermi give a value about @xmath8 ev , which is @xmath9 smaller than the experimental value ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "relativity can be taken into account by multiplying non - relativistic value with a relativistic correction factor @xmath10 @xcite . in bismuth case @xmath11 and factor @xmath12 .",
    "the relativistic generalization of the fermi formulae holds for point - like nucleus and gives a hfs for @xmath4bi@xmath5 of about @xmath13 ev , which is @xmath14 larger than the experimental value ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "the effect of spatial distribution of the nuclear charge was analyzed in pioneering works by rosenthal , breit @xcite and others @xcite and it is sometimes called `` breit - rosenthal effect '' . the correction factor for the nuclear charge distribution can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a small number which depends mainly on the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the nuclear charge distribution , @xmath17 . by assuming a uniform spherical symmetric charge distribution and using the experimental value @xmath18 fm @xcite for the nuclear charge distribution",
    ", @xmath16 can be calculated to be @xmath19 in the case of @xmath4bi@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the relativistic hfs energy splitting in @xmath4bi@xmath5 for a uniformly charged nucleus becomes than about @xmath20 ev , which is @xmath21 larger than the experimental value ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "there are two principal corrections to the fermi - breit formulae that is necessary to take into account : the magnetic moment distribution within the nucleus @xcite and radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "both of these corrections are of comparable magnitude .",
    "the correction for an extended nuclear magnetization was first studied in an innovative work by a. bohr and v. weisskopf @xcite and is also called `` bohr - weisskopf effect '' .",
    "recently , three approaches for theoretical determination of the bohr - weisskopf effect have been used .",
    "the simplest of these approaches is based on a solution of the schrdinger equation for a nucleon in a mean - field potential , the solution gives the distribution for the unpaired nucleon in the nucleus and the distribution is used to determine hyperfine splitting .",
    "this approach has been used by shabaev _",
    "_ @xcite and by gustavsson _",
    ". a slightly more sophisticated approach , giving equivalent results for the hfs in leading order , is the `` dynamical proton model '' ( dpm ) , where the odd proton of the bismuth nucleus is treated as a dirac particle bound in a mean - field potential .",
    "the first order hfs in hydrogen - like bi is then given by a photon exchange between the electron and the proton .",
    "dpm was introduced by labzowsky _",
    "the third and more complete approach is a many - body calculation with the use of `` dynamical correlation model '' ( dcm ) .",
    "this approach is the only calculation of the bohr - weisskopf effect which includes many - body contributions and tomaselli _ et al . _",
    "have used it for studies of several systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dominant electrostatic and hyperfine interactions with nucleus , the electron also interacts with radiation field , an interaction described by qed .",
    "the leading qed corrections originate from the one - loop self - energy and vacuum - polarization effects .",
    "the one - loop qed effects for hfs have been calculated by different groups and the results are consistent @xcite .    in this work we consider a contribution of the magnetic moment distribution within the nucleus to the hydrogen - like ion hfs .",
    "our approach is close to the one used in @xcite .",
    "this microscopic approach is based mainly on the migdal s theory of finite fermi system ( ffst ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . essentially , this approach is equivalent to calculation of the core polarization effects with the use of an effective interaction .",
    "the first calculation of the core polarization goes back to fifties @xcite and this early development was summarized in @xcite .",
    "modern calculations , however , differ significantly in the size of the single - particle space included into sum over intermediate particle - hole states .",
    "for spherical nuclei all single - particle space , including continuum is included into calculation .",
    "this is one difference between our approach and the dcm where one has to use the restricted single - particle space .",
    "another difference between our work and @xcite is that rpa accounts for ground state correlations represented graphically by backward going loops . and , finally , we use explicitly the correction to nuclear electromagnetic current due to velocity dependent interaction",
    "this correction was absent in @xcite since they use velocity independent forces .",
    "previously , this correction was discussed in @xcite in connection to the bohr - weisskopf effect in bismuth muonic atom .",
    "it was shown that this correction is not negligible . here",
    "we extend this analysis to the hydrogen - like ions around @xmath2pb nucleus .",
    "in ffst the effect of the core polarization is described by introducing an effective single - particle operator ( vertex ) @xmath22 satisfying the equation @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is in our case the bare single - particle @xmath25 operator , @xmath26 the polarization operator of a particle - hole pair , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the single - particle green function . @xmath29 is the amplitude of quasi - particle interaction .",
    "equation ( [ main ] ) is written in the re - normalized form , i.e. after elimination of a regular part in the green function @xmath28 .",
    "the regular part of the @xmath30-function corresponding to admixture of three- or more particle states produces the effective charges @xmath31 , and re - normalizes the interaction amplitude @xmath32 in ( [ main ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we choose @xmath31 as a constant independent of the particular state @xmath33 , but different for the spin and orbital parts of the operator @xmath24 : @xmath34 the constants @xmath35 in ( [ zetas ] ) and ( [ zetal ] ) were taken as equal for both protons and neutrons since the main deviation of the magnetic moments from single - particle values is in the isovector part of the @xmath25 operator .",

    "the values of the @xmath25 moments can be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the vertex ( [ vertex ] ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the set of nucleon quantum numbers , and @xmath45 is the reduced matrix element of the tensor operators ( [ operators ] ) .    reducing the angular and spin variables in equation ( [ main ] ) we obtain in coordinate representation the system of integrals equations @xmath46 where we have introduce @xmath47 .",
    "the kernel of the integrals equations ( [ main2 ] ) is the sum of two terms @xmath48 for the spin - spin interaction ( [ ssint ] ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the sun over isospin variables is assumed .",

    "the green function can be calculated using two linear independent solution of the radial schrdinger equation .",
    "this method allows one to use all of the single - particle spectrum @xcite,@xcite . for the spin - orbit interaction ( [ lsint ] )",
    "expression @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 is more complicated ( see @xcite ) .",
