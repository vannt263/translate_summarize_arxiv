    "the central issue in the study of evolution of open systems is the observed _ irreversibility _ of both classical as well as quantum dynamics .",
    "open systems interacting with an environment gradually loose their information content and decohere , which means that after some time their states are to some extent determined by the initial parameters of the environment .",
    "such behavior can not be described by unitary transformations and has led to an introduction of a phenomenological dynamical postulate for open systems @xcite - the _ semigroup property _ of the time evolution @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a transformation acting on the set of all possible states @xmath3 of a given quantum system corresponding to the hilbert space @xmath4 . in this case",
    "it is possible that pure quantum states evolve into mixtures , and vice versa .",
    "the irreversibility is related to the non - existence of the inverse evolution @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", the inverse map can exist in the mathematical sense , but the resulting map does not describe a valid quantum evolution .",
    "the physical maps @xmath0 must satisfy several constraints @xcite : they have to be linear , trace - preserving and they have to be completely positive for all @xmath6",
    ".    the state of the system @xmath7 is obtained by the application of the map on the initial state @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "equations of motion that describe this type of dynamics has the so - called _ lindblad form _ @xcite : @xmath10=-i[h,\\varrho_t ] + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}c_{\\alpha\\beta } \\left ( [ \\lambda_\\alpha,\\varrho_t\\lambda_\\beta]+ [ \\lambda_\\alpha\\varrho_t,\\lambda_\\beta ] \\right)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 for @xmath14 and the coefficients @xmath15 form a positive matrix .",

    ", however , if these maps possess the semigroup property , then the generator is independent of time .",
    "the derivation of the particular master equation , which drives the evolution of open system , is usually based on the idea that the open system is a part of the larger closed system with the underlying unitary dynamics described by schrdinger equation . however , after tracing out the environment , the induced set of maps @xmath0 essentially never fulfills the semigroup property . in order to obtain this feature of dynamics various approximations",
    "have to be applied @xcite , for instance the born - markov approximation , the weak - coupling limit , the mean - field limit , etc .",
    "master equations of the lindblad form are valid only under specific physical conditions , but still provide us with a very reasonable approximative picture of the exact dynamics of open quantum systems .    in this paper we will present a novel method how to derive master equations .",
    "we will consider that the interaction between the system and its environment consists of bipartite collisions .",
    "for this we assume that the environment consists of @xmath21 particles ( quantum systems ) of the same physical origin as the system under consideration .",
    "in our model we assume that the environment is initially `` prepared '' in a factorized state @xmath22 and the system interacts with each particle from the environment at most once .",
    "each collision is described by a unitary transformation @xmath23 , which induces a map @xmath24 ( see fig.[col_model ] ) . as a result",
    "this _ collision - like _ model determines a discrete evolution described by powers of the map @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 with @xmath27 corresponding to the @xmath28th collision .",
    "the set of maps @xmath29 with @xmath30 obviously fulfills the semigroup property , i.e. @xmath31 in other words the maps @xmath32 form a _",
    "one - parametric discrete semigroup_.    the question is whether we may replace the discrete dynamics @xmath32 with a continuous one @xmath0 such that @xmath33 for times @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is some fixed time interval between subsequent collisions ) , and the maps @xmath0 satisfy the semigroup property . in other words the task is to interpolate a discrete set of points with a line in the abstract space of quantum maps .",
    "obviously , on the time scale less than @xmath35 the continuous evolution is different from the discrete one .",
    "however , our interest is to describe the overall evolution rather than a sequence of isolated collision . in this sense ,",
    "the continuous dynamics is a good approximation of the discrete one .",
    "our aim is to describe the intrinsically discrete collision model in the language of quantum dynamical semigroups , i.e. continuous master equations .",
    "we derive the master equation in the following way .",
    "firstly , we will express the powers of the map @xmath24 in a specific form .",
    "the discrete parameter @xmath28 numbering the order of interaction of the system with environment particles will be replaced by a continuous parameter @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "correspondingly , we have a continuous set of maps @xmath0 .",
    "the question is , whether these maps are completely positive , and whether they form a semigroup . if , moreover , the inverse maps @xmath5 exist , then we can derive the master equation by using the expression for the generator in eq .",

    "we will present two specific examples , for which the derived master equations correspond to an exponential decay , and to a decoherence process .",
    "it is important to understand which bipartite interactions underly these type of processes .",
    "we will be interested only in two - dimensional systems , i.e. qubits .",
    "in what follows we will use the so - called _ left - right formalism _ , or real matrix representation of quantum maps , and real vector representation of quantum states of a qubit .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the general rule is that before deriving of the master equation itself one has to check that the maps are valid quantum maps and that they fulfills the semigroup property .",
    "however , here we will directly derive the generator , and from its properties the character of transformation will become obvious . using the method described in previous sections",
    "we find out that the derived generator is time independent and it takes the form @xmath98 consequently , the master equation is of the lindblad form with _ time - independent _ coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath53 . in particular , the non - vanishing parameters do read @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 and the matrix of @xmath54 is positive whenever @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",

    "@xcite ) , according to which the decay is maximally two times faster than the decoherence , i.e. @xmath105 , or equivalently @xmath106 .",
    "its validity in the case of homogenization can be checked by direct calculation .",
    "the positivity of the matrix @xmath54 guarantees the complete positivity of the whole evolution .",
    "the master equation of the homogenization process reads @xmath107 + \\frac{\\gamma_1}{4}(s_1\\varrho s_1+s_2\\varrho s_2 - 2\\varrho ) + \\frac{2\\gamma_2-\\gamma_1}{4}(s_3\\varrho s_3-\\varrho)\\\\ \\hspace*{2cm}-iw\\gamma_1(s_1\\varrho s_2-s_2\\varrho s_1 + i\\varrho s_3+is_3\\varrho)\\ ; , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath66 are given by eq.(10 ) .",
    "let us note that the parameter @xmath108 describes only the hamiltonian part of evolution , which is in accordance with our expectations .",
    "the hamiltonian part causes the rotation , whereas the other part of the generator induces a contraction into the fixed point @xmath61 . only in the case when the homogenization is completed the map can not be inverted , but strictly speaking this happens in the limit of time goes to infinity .",
    "let us make the following choice of parameters : @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "in this case the master equation takes a simple form @xmath111 + \\gamma[2 s_- \\varrho s_+ - s_- s_+ \\varrho - \\varrho s_-s_+]\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath112 .",
    "this is the well known equation describing the process of exponential decay with the hamiltonian @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "in this section we will analyze a collision - like dynamics which models a decoherence of a qubit .",
    "a more general treatment of decoherence will be presented elsewhere @xcite , while here we will concentrate to the derivation of the master equation .",
    "the task will be the same as before , except that instead of the partial - swap operation we will consider a _ partial cnot _",
    "( controlled - not operation ) , i.e. @xmath114 . the @xmath115 gate performs the @xmath116 rotation on the _ target qubit _",
    ", when the _ control qubit _ is in the state @xmath117 . if the control is in the state @xmath96 , then the state of the target qubit is not changed .",
    "unlike the swap operation , the controlled not is asymmetric under the exchange of qubits .",
    "therefore , we have two different evolutions determined by the role of the system qubit : it can be either the target qubit , or the control qubit .",
    "let us assume the system qubit acts as the target . in this case",
    "the interaction induces the map on the target qubit that reads @xmath118 where we used again the notation @xmath119 and @xmath120 stands for @xmath121 , i.e. it is the parameter that characterizes the initial state of reservoir qubits . for the calculation of the powers of this map we will use the same approach as before , because again we need to calculate the powers of 2x2 matrix @xmath84 of the specific form @xmath122 in the last equality we exploited the identity @xmath123 and we set @xmath124 to obtain the form suitable for evaluating the powers .",
    "note that @xmath125 . in our particular case @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "that is , @xmath128 following the same methods as in the previous section we can derive the generator of the process @xmath42 in a very simple form @xmath129 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(\\sigma_x\\varrho_t\\sigma_x-\\varrho_t)\\ ; .\\ ] ] as seen from its structure this generator describes a `` pure '' decoherence , i.e. a process of diagonalization of the state in the basis associated with the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath116 .",
    "the parameters of the dynamics are defined in a similar way as before , i.e. @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "if we consider the system qubit to play the role of the control , then the dynamical map @xmath74 is very similar to the previous case , i.e. @xmath132 where @xmath133 . defining the parameters @xmath134 , @xmath135 we can directly write down the master equation @xmath136 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(\\sigma_z\\varrho_t\\sigma_z-\\varrho_t)\\ ; .\\ ] ] likewise in the previous case we obtain the dynamics describing the decoherence",
    "nevertheless , there is a difference , if the system qubit plays the role of the control , then the decoherence is observed in the basis associated with the eigenvectors of the @xmath137 operator , rather then in the basis of eigenvectors @xmath116 that was the case when the system qubit plays the role of the target .",
    "we see that irrespective on the fact whether the system qubit is a controle or a target the sequence of partial cnot collisions leads to decoherence processes .",
    "there are two differences though .",
    "the first one is the basis in which the decoherence takes place and the second is the decoherence time . in particular , the decoherence rates depend on the initial state of the reservoir @xmath61 in different ways .",
    "we have shown that using a simple collision - like model one can derive master equations for a qubit interacting with an environment . in our approach",
    "the discrete dynamics is described by a sequence of unitary transformations representing bi - partite interactions ( `` collisions '' ) . as a result of the collision - like evolution",
    "the induced one - qubit dynamics is discrete , too .",
    "however , we have shown that in specific cases ( the partial swap operation and the partial cnot operation ) this essentially discrete evolution can be substituted by a continuous dynamics .",
    "the resulting time evolution fulfills the semigroup property . using the state - space description of the dynamics of a qubit",
    "we can say that the evolution of a qubit state that undergoes a sequence of collisions can be illustrated as a ordered sequence of points in the bloch sphere .",
    "we have shown how to connect these points with a smooth line representing the continuous time evolution driven by a lindblad master equation .",
    "the presented approach can be generalized to higher - dimensional quantum systems ( qudits ) , as well as to collisions described by more general bi - partite unitary transformations @xmath23 .",
    "the method essentially works for any interaction which induce an _ invertible _ map @xmath25",
    "( i.e. @xmath138 ) .",
    "it turns out that semigroups @xmath139 always contain only invertible maps , because for the ( usually unphysical ) map @xmath140 the following identity holds @xmath141 .",
    "another ( open ) problem concerning the derivation of the master equation from a discrete collision - like dynamics is whether for all invertible mappings @xmath25 , the semigroup generated by its powers can be always interpolated with a continuous semigroup of completely positive maps .",
    "this problem leads to the question about the structure of the set of quantum semigroups .",
    "it is worth to study which bi - partite interactions in the collision - like models could stand behind the known quantum processes described approximatively by quantum master equations .",
    "we believe that this approach of derivation of the master equations provides us with a new insight into the dynamics of open systems .",
