    "let @xmath0 be a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath2 , and consider the deformation space of convex @xmath3 structures @xmath1 on @xmath0 .",
    "topologically , we know that @xmath1 is a cell of dimension @xmath4 by goldman @xcite . moreover , in @xcite , goldman proved that , just as in the case of hyperbolic structures on @xmath0 , convex @xmath3 structures on @xmath0 are given by specifying convex @xmath3 structures on the pairs of pants in a pants decomposition of @xmath0 and then assembling them together .",
    "this allowed him to parameterize @xmath1 in a way similar to the fenchel - nielsen parameterization of teichmller space @xmath5 .    to define the goldman parameterization of @xmath1 , we first need to choose a pants decomposition @xmath6 for @xmath0 .",
    "there are then three kinds of parameters in the goldman parameterization ; the twist - bulge parameters , the boundary invariants and the internal parameters .",
    "the twist - bulge parameters describe how to glue pairs of pants together , and are the analog of the fenchel - nielsen twist coordinates .",
    "the boundary invariants contain the eigenvalue information of the holonomy about each simple closed curve in @xmath6 , and correspond to the fenchel - nielsen length coordinates .",
    "however , unlike the hyperbolic case , specifying only the boundary invariants and the twist - bulge parameters is insufficient to nail down a point in @xmath1 .",
    "the internal parameters are thus designed to describe this  residual deformation \" . for every pair of pants in the pants decomposition of @xmath0",
    ", we have two internal parameters , which take values in a @xmath7-cell @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "choose a goldman parameterization of @xmath1 , and consider a sequence in @xmath1 so that all the boundary invariants vary within a compact set , but every pair of internal parameters eventually leave every compact set in @xmath8 .",
    "we call such a sequence a _ goldman sequence_. one should think of a goldman sequence as a deformation of the convex @xmath3 structure on @xmath0  away \" from the image of the natural embedding @xmath10 , also known as the _ fuchsian locus_. the following is the main theorem of this paper .",
    "let @xmath6 be a pants decomposition on @xmath0 and choose a goldman parameterization of @xmath1 that is compatible with @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a goldman sequence in @xmath1 . then the following hold :    1 .",
    "the length of the shortest ( in the hilbert metric ) homotopically non - trivial closed curve in @xmath12 that is not homotopic to a multiple of a curve in @xmath6 grows arbitrarily large as @xmath13 approaches @xmath14 .",
    "the topological entropy of @xmath12 converges to @xmath15 as @xmath13 approaches @xmath14 .    here , the _",
    "hilbert metric _ is a canonical finsler metric that one can define on any convex @xmath3 surface , and the _ topological entropy _ is a quantification of the  complexity \" of the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of the convex @xmath3 surface .",
    "these are discussed more carefully in section [ thehilbertmetric ] and section [ entropygeodesicflow ] respectively . a slightly more general version of the above theorem ( allowing for surfaces with boundary ) is stated as theorem [ mainthm1 ] .",
    "this theorem has several interesting implications , which we list here .",
    "the general theme of these corollaries is to highlight the differences between @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "there is a natural action of the mapping class group of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath16 , on any deformation space of @xmath17-structures on @xmath0 by pre - composition with the marking . in the case when this deformation space is @xmath5 , there are two well - known results . the first is known as _ mumford compactness _",
    "@xcite , which states that for any @xmath18 , the quotient of @xmath19 by @xmath16 is compact .",
    "a corollary of ( 1 ) of the main theorem ( via an easy diagonalization argument ) is that there exists a sequence @xmath11 in @xmath1 such that the length of the shortest closed curve in @xmath12 grows arbitrarily large .",
    "since the length of the shortest closed curve is a continuous function on @xmath1 that is invariant under the action of @xmath16 , this implies that in contrast to the case of @xmath5 , mumford compactness fails when the deformation space is @xmath1 .    for any @xmath18 ,",
    "the quotient of @xmath20 by @xmath16 is not compact .",
    "this corollary can also be obtained by applying proposition 3.4 of benoist - hulin @xcite to loftin s work in @xcite .",
    "the second is a result by abikoff @xcite , who proved that the action of @xmath16 on @xmath5 extends continuously to the augmented teichmller space @xmath21 , and the quotient @xmath22 is a compactification of @xmath23 . by considering an algebraic construction of @xmath21",
    ", one can define a natural analog of this augmentation for @xmath1 , on which the natural action of @xmath16 on @xmath1 extends continuously .",
    "( canary - storm @xcite constructed such an analog for the deformation space of kleinian surface groups , which can also be done in the convex @xmath3 structures setting . ) a consequence of ( 1 ) of our theorem is that the quotient of this analogous augmentation by @xmath16 is not compact .",
    "also , crampon @xcite proved that the topological entropy of the convex @xmath3 structures in @xmath1 are bounded above by @xmath24 , and that the value @xmath24 is achieved if and only if the structure lies in the fuchsian locus .",
    "later , nie @xcite showed that one can find a sequence in @xmath1 so that the topological entropy converges to @xmath15 .",
    "( in fact , their results hold for convex real projective structures on some manifolds of higher dimensions as well . )",
    "the next corollary of our theorem is then the natural next step in this progression of questions , and gives a positive answer to a question asked by crampon and marquis .",
    "( questions 13 of @xcite . )    for any @xmath25 $ ] , there is a diverging sequence of convex projective structures so that the topological entropy of the structures along this sequence converges to @xmath26 .",
    "finally , our theorem also implies how several other geometric properties , such as the area of the convex @xmath3 surface , degenerate along goldman sequences .",
    "let @xmath11 be a goldman sequence in @xmath1 , then the area of @xmath12 grows to @xmath14 as @xmath13 approaches @xmath14 .",
    "now , we will give a brief description of the strategy to prove the main theorem .",
    "let @xmath27 be any convex @xmath3 structure in @xmath1 , i.e. a marked convex @xmath3 surface .",
    "the key behind the proof is the observation that we can write the hilbert distance between certain pairs of points in @xmath27 in terms of the goldman parameters for @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the formulas for these distances are relatively simple , so we can understand how they change as we vary the goldman parameters . with this in mind , we find a way to decompose each closed curve in @xmath27 into geodesic segments whose lengths we can bound from below by the distances between these special pairs of points . fortuitously ,",
    "the lower bound that we obtain this way goes to infinity as we deform the convex projective structure along goldman sequences .",
    "this gives us ( 1 ) .    to obtain ( 2 )",
    ", we use the fact that the geodesic flow corresponding to the convex @xmath3 structures on @xmath0 is anosov , and that the non - wandering set for this flow is all of @xmath28 .",
    "the work of bowen @xcite then allows us to compute the topological entropy of the geodesic flow by the asymptotic exponential growth rate of orbits .",
    "it turns out that the lower bound in ( 1 ) is strong enough to yield an upper bound on the topological entropy , which vanishes as we deform along goldman sequences .",
    "the rest of this paper is divided into two sections . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    ", we give a brief introduction to the main objects of study in this paper and explain the tools used to prove the main theorem . in section [ maincontent ] , we will give the proof of the main theorem , as well as state and prove a couple of corollaries .",
    "this work has benefitted from conversations with gye - seon lee while he and the author were at the center for quantum geometry of moduli spaces during august of 2013 .",
    "the author also especially wishes to thank richard canary for introducing him to this subject , and the many fruitful discussions they have had in the course of writing this paper .",
    "finally , the author is very grateful for the referee s careful reading of this paper and his / her many helpful comments .",
    "in this subsection , we will define the main objects of study in this paper , and introduce some of their well - known properties . before we do so",
    ", we will make some comments on terminology and notation .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we will only consider orientable surfaces that admit a pants decomposition .",
    "hence , we will use the word  surface \" to mean  compact smooth orientable surface with negative euler characteristic \" .",
    "also , we will always use @xmath0 to denote a surface ( without any projective structure ) and @xmath29 to denote a smooth pair of pants . by an oriented curve in @xmath0 ,",
