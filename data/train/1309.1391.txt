    "a quantum version of _ brachistochrone problem _ that how fast a quantum system can evolve between two distinguishable states is of paramount importance in quantum information processing , for a transition from a state to its orthogonal one is regarded as the elementary step of a computational process @xcite . during the past decades , the study on the minimum time a quantum state required for reaching its orthogonal one , i.e. , the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) time , has been mainly focused on closed quantum systems with unitary evolution , and a unified lower bound of qsl was obtained @xcite : @xmath0 , where the first quantity in braces is known as mandelstam - tamm ( mt ) type bound with @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the quantum system @xcite while the second one is referred to as margolus - levitin ( ml ) type bound with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these bounds , providing a fundamental limit of the operation rate , are applicable to considerable quantum tasks such as quantum state transfer @xcite , quantum optimal control @xcite , and quantum metrology metrology and have been extended to nonorthogonal state cases fz1,fz2,fz3,fz4,fz5 and derived from geometric aspects @xcite .",
    "in realistic physical processes , however , the quantum systems are open , and the environmental influence must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "recently , the qsl time has been extended to nonunitary evolution of open systems @xcite .",
    "two mt type bounds of qsl , based on the variance of the generator of the dynamics , were derived and applied to several typical noisy channels @xcite and estimate the speed limits for quantum metrology under noise @xcite .",
    "importantly , a unified qsl bound including both mt and ml types for non - markovian processes has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ml bound is also proven to be sharper than the mt bound .",
    "interestingly , it is discovered that the non - markovian effect can speed up the quantum evolution with a damped jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model op3 .",
    "all - optical system has been regarded as an excellent test bed to explore the foundations of quantum physics as well as quantum information processing @xcite . in this paper , with a photon in a simulated non - markovian environment , we show that non - markovian effect can slow down the quantum evolution which is contrary to former situation that non - markovianity will lead to smaller qsl time for jc model op3 .",
    "in addition , we illustrate that the qsl time of a photon can be well controlled by adjusting the environment parameter .",
    "the above phenomena can be immediately tested with the experimental setups in refs .",

    "the open system we consider in this paper is the polarization degree of a photon with its frequency functioning as the environment . to simulate the non - markovian dynamics of the photon",
    ", we employ an experimental setup containing a rotatable fabry - prot ( fp ) cavity followed by an interference filter and a quartz plate @xcite ( see in fig .",
    "a frequency comb of the photon is generated by a fp cavity and then two peaks are filtered out through the interference filter .",
    "the filtered frequency distribution @xmath4 , representing the probability density of finding photon in a mode with frequency @xmath5 in this letter , is set to be a two - peaked gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath6 @xmath7which are centered at @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the same width @xmath10 and is normalized as @xmath11 .",

    "( [ fw ] ) controls the relative weight of the two peaks , which can be adjusted by changing the tilted angle of the fp cavity @xcite .",
    "then the non - markovian dephasing process of the polarization degree of the photon can occur in the interaction with its frequency degree in a quartz plate with the following hamiltonian hamiltonian @xmath13where @xmath14 is the refraction index of photon in the quartz plate , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denotes the polarization state serving as the open system , and @xmath18 is the environmental state with @xmath19 . the photon polarization state at time @xmath20 reads @xmath21with @xmath22 the quantum map and @xmath23.$ ] the density matrix of the polarization degree is then explicitly given by @xmath24where @xmath25 is the dephasing rate with @xmath26 . by the frequency distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fw ] ) , it takes the form @xmath27",
    "a unified lower bound including both mt and ml types for the minimal evolution time between an initial open system state @xmath28 and its target state @xmath29 , governed by the master equation @xmath30 with @xmath31 the positive generator of the dynamical semigroup @xmath32 has been derived @xcite : @xmath33with @xmath34 , \\text { } ( p=1,2,\\infty ) \\]]where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37-norm of operator @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the singular values of operator @xmath40 .",

    "with above model , for instance , we will evaluate the minimal evolution time between states @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath47 and @xmath49 denote the states of photon entering and leaving the quartz plate respectively with @xmath50 the actual driving time when the photon under non - markovian dephasing . for simplicity",

    "in order to study the non - markovian effect on the qsl time [ eq .",
    "( [ qsl1 ] ) ] , we will employ two popular measures for non - markovianity : the divisibility of quantum maps @xcite and the information flow @xcite based methods .    a quantum map @xmath57}$ ] is divisible if @xmath58 for all @xmath59 with @xmath60 completely positive . in ref .",

    "note that @xmath71 with @xmath72 after simple calculations , we find that for small @xmath73 , the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath74 are @xmath75we then get @xmath76according to eq .",
    "( [ rhp ] ) , we have @xmath77    the second measure for the non - markovianity is based on the total amount of information , characterized by trace distance @xmath78 of a pair of evolved quantum states @xmath79 , flowing back from the environment . the direction of information flow is in dependence of the gradient @xmath80 , with positive gradient indicating information flowing back to the system .",
    "the non - markovianity is then defined as @xcite @xmath81where the maximization is over all initial state pairs@xmath82 for single qubit , the optimal problem is easy to solve @xcite and the optimal trace distance of the evolved states is found to be @xmath83 liu .",
