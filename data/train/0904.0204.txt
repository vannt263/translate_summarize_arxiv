    "understanding interference has been seminal in optics .",
    "more than two centuries ago , young presented his bakerian lecture which contained an experimental demonstration of the general law of interference of light@xcite .",
    "fifteen years later , fresnel and arago studied the effect of the polarization state of light beams in the phenomena of interference@xcite .",
    "thus , through interference , evidence of the transverse wave nature of light was brought forward .    in the second half of the twentieth century",
    "there were many studies on the interference of polarized light for the undergraduate laboratory .",
    "various interferometric methods were proposed to carry out such experiments using ( i ) a young double slit experiment , covering both slits with different polarizing filters@xcite ; ( ii ) the polarizing properties of the ordinary and extraordinary axis in a double refracting crystal of calcite @xcite or a nematic liquid crystal@xcite ; ( iii ) a ronchi grating as beam splitter placing polarizing filters afterwards the grating and analyzing at the conjugate plane of the grating through a focusing element @xcite ; ( iv ) a mach - zehnder interferometer with polarizing filters at each arm @xcite .",
    "just to list a few schemes .",
    "in the same period of time , a sound mathematical description for the young double slit experiment with polarized light was presented characterizing the resulting field by the stokes parameters@xcite . also , an alternate mathematical formulation and a proposal for using this scheme in image processing involving wollaston prisms was discussed@xcite .",
    "recently , this was used to understand the concept of a quantum eraser , where the polarization of two macroscopic fields is manipulated to loose or restore interference fringes @xcite .    in all of the aforementioned studies , discussions focused on understanding the resulting intensity pattern , which is directly related to the fresnel - arago laws .",
    "to our knowledge , little has been said about the polarization state of the resulting field ; it is possible to obtain a @xmath0-linearly polarized field from the superposition of two collinear fields with right and left circular polarization , with the given angle @xmath1 $ ] degrees defined by the phase difference between the superposing fields@xcite .",
    "we believe the analysis of the superposition of two light fields could go beyond the study of fresnel - arago laws .",
    "our motivation comes from the fact that a rich spatially dependent polarization structure , known as a polarization grating , arises from the superposition of two non - collinear polarized light beams with different polarizations .",
    "this polarization grating can be used to simplify the fabrication of three dimensional periodic microstructres eliminating complicated procedures to optimize contrast and polarization@xcite .",
    "it can be recorded in polarization sensitive materials , like bacteriorhodopsin , to perform phase shifting shearing interferometry without neither mechanical moving parts nor mounted gratings@xcite .",
    "it can also be used to simultaneously rotate or control the orientation of multiple microscopic birefringent particles , which might be useful for biomedical applications@xcite .",
    "these are just a few examples involving polarization gratings in modern research .",
    "our experimental proposal uses a slightly modified mach - zehnder interferometer to produce light with spatially varying polarization .",
    "our theoretical description of the experiment is based on jones calculus@xcite and stokes parameters@xcite for polarized monochromatic light .",
    "the analysis is complemented with three specific examples involving the superposition of combinations of linearly and circularly polarized light showing some specific polarization gratings that can be produced with the proposed scheme .",
    "the presence of such polarization structures is experimentally confirmed through qualitative analysis of the resulting light field with a linear polarizer .",
    "we encourage the reader to reproduce the experiment and calculate the values for the stokes parameters of the resulting field@xcite .    for readers who may not be familiar with jones calculus and",
    "stokes parameters we suggest the textbooks by simmons and guttmann@xcite or by born and wolf@xcite in addition to the articles mentioned above@xcite . for those interested in an advanced treatment ,",
    "we recommend as a starting point the articles by tervo _ et .",
    "al_@xcite and roychowdhury and wolf@xcite , as well as the introductory book by wolf@xcite .",
    "their analyses deal with polarization and coherence degree of superposed arbitrary electromagnetic fields in three dimensional space .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] illustrates a simplified version of the superposition scheme .",
    "we focus on the plane of incidence defined by the @xmath2-plane so the @xmath3-coordinate will be obviated .",
    "two polarized monochromatic plane waves of light intersect with a small angle @xmath0 , such that @xmath4 in radians , at some point @xmath5 on the detection line @xmath6 .",
    "such light fields are described by the equations @xmath7 where the distances @xmath8 are the distances from the @xmath9-th beam source to the point @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath11 .",

    "the source for both beams is the same laser so the initial phase difference is null , @xmath33 .",
    "the experimental setup uses small angles , @xmath34 radians , that for practical purposes , @xmath35 and @xmath4 .",
    "these experimentally feasible restrictions allow us to consider the polarization state of the second field beam @xmath36 in its own reference frame and in the general reference frame almost equal ; i.  e. the jones vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 are almost parallel , @xmath39 these approximations simplify the theoretical treatment , thus the real parts involved in the last term of eq .",
    "are given by @xmath40 as usual , the stokes parameter @xmath41 is useful for discussing the intensity profile at the detection line such as discussed by pescetti@xcite or collet@xcite , while the latter three parameters , @xmath42 to @xmath43 , relate to the polarization state of the field .    our purpose is to understand the polarization properties of the total field . in order to do so ,",
    "let us consider the interfering beams carrying orthogonal polarizations , that is @xmath44 .",
    "notice that two orthogonal polarization vectors can be written as @xmath45 and @xmath46 if we relax the restrictions on the domain of @xmath47 .",
    "the stokes parameters for orthogonal polarization vectors fulfill the condition @xmath48 for @xmath49 ; the points on the polarization sphere that represent these vectors being antipodes .",
    "it is also possible to parametrize the amplitudes of the fields as @xmath50 in a range @xmath51 $ ] , such that the corresponding normalized stokes parameters for the total electromagnetic field on the detection line are @xmath52 it is possible to write the latter three normalized stokes parameters , @xmath53 to @xmath54 , as the vector , @xmath55 with the vector @xmath56 defining a great circle on the @xmath57-plane of the polarization sphere , @xmath58 and the rotation matrices given in the traditional way @xmath59    equation [ eq : orthogonaleq ] implies that the parameter @xmath47 generates a counterclockwise rotation around the @xmath60-axis , the parameter @xmath61 acts as a scaling factor and a @xmath62-translation on the great circle @xmath56 , and the parameter @xmath63 as a counterclockwise rotation around the @xmath64-axis .",
    "+ the counterclockwise rotations were expected .",
