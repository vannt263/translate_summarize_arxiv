    "in many - body quantum theory , the presence of two - particle interactions , renders the wavefunctions prohibitly complicated objects , that can only be obtained in simple models or for systems containing very few particles .",
    "the coulomb interaction represents a prominent example in electronic structure problems and a large part of the research in chemical and solid state physics is devoted to developing and applying approximate treatments of this interaction . if one is interested in the energy spectrum of a particular system , the simplest approach is to diagonalize the non - interacting hamiltonian and correct for the coulomb interactions perturbatively .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction is by no means weak and the convergence of such a perturbative approach is questionable . in particular , the non - interacting wavefunctions are slater determinants composed of single particle orbitals and if the true many - body wavefunctions are poorly approximated by such an approximation , one would expect standard perturbation theory to fail .",
    "another approach to the problem is to apply a mean - field approach like hartree - fock ( hf ) or kohn - sham density functional theory ( ks - dft ) , where the coulomb interaction is replaced by an average value , which acts as an external potential . as a consequence ,",
    "the many - body wavefunction becomes a slater determinant composed of single - particle orbitals that are easily obtained as eigenfunctions of the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "again , one faces the problem that if the true many - body wavefunction is poorly approximated by a slater determinant , the mean field approach is bound to yield a bad approximation for the wavefunctions .",
    "nevertheless , in ks - dft the mean field hamiltonian does not have to approximate the interacting system , but it is still possible to calculate the correct ground state energy provided one knows the exact exchange - correlation functional .",
    "however , in practice the exchange - correlation functional has to be approximated and will typically perform poorly if the mean field hamiltonian does not describe the same physics as the interacting hamiltonian.@xcite    systems whose ground states are poorly described by a slater determinant are referred to as static correlated .",
    "the generic example of static correlation is the hydrogen molecule in the dissociation limit , which is well described by the heitler - london wavefunction@xcite @xmath1/2\\notag,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes a @xmath3 orbital of atom @xmath4 .",
    "this state correctly captures the correlated effect that if one electron is found on one atom , the other electron will be on the other atom .",

    "the probability of finding both electrons on the same atom is always @xmath8 independent of the interatomic distance .",
    "hf theory then predicts a ground state energy in the dissociation limit , which is @xmath9 7 ev too high and ks - dft with standard semi - local functionals , predicts the energy to be @xmath9 2 ev too high.@xcite the true many - body wavefunction will resemble at equilibrium binding distance and approach in the dissociation limit . which of the two wavefunction provide the better description",
    "is determined by the relative magnitudes of the hybridization integrals and the coulomb repulsion between two electrons occupying the same spatial orbital .",
    "the dissociation limit , where the wavefunction is described by can be thought of as non - perturbative , since the coulomb interaction is much larger than the hybridization , which gives rise to the delocalized @xmath7-orbitals .",
    "the hf and ks - dft results are far from the desired accuracy in such approaches and it has proven a highly non - trivial task to construct exchange - correlation functionals , that can describe the strong static correlation in this system .",
    "one exception is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which was demonstrated to produce the correct dissociation limit of the n@xmath0 molecule by furche.@xcite subsequently , the rpa has been shown to dissociate several diatomic molecules ( including h@xmath0 ) correctly.@xcite in these approaches , the calculations are performed non - self - consistently and the method is then equivalent to perturbation theory to infinite order using a subset of terms in the perturbative expansion . at intermediate distances",
    ", however , rpa shows qualitative deviation from the exact dissociation energy curve .",
    "in particular , a spurious maximum appears and the rpa energy decays too slowly towards the dissociation limit , whereas the exact result rises monotonically to the dissociation limit as the distance is increased .",
    "attempts to improve upon this within time - dependent dft@xcite ( tddft ) , have only resulted in an improvement in the absolute correlation energies , but not eliminated the spurious maximum . on the other hand , from a perturbative point of view",
    "it is natural to augment rpa with antisymmetrized terms at each order in the perturbation expansion , which eliminates self - interaction terms in rpa .",
    "this correction is referred to as second order screened exchange ( sosex ) @xcite and has been shown to completely deteriorate the good description of static correlation within rpa.@xcite recently , it has been demonstrated that total energies obtained from the gw approximation , can not dissociate the hydrogen molecule correctly.@xcite this is highly surprising , since the perturbative expansions involved in rpa and gw are topologically identical and illustrates the subtle nature of the approximations , which are able to capture the static correlation correctly .",
    "even for such a simple system , first principles calculations can quickly become rather involved . in order to better understand the physical content of the different approximations",
    ", we will therefore employ a hubbard hamiltonian as a model for a dimer system with on - site coulomb interactions .",
    "this model was previously applied to analyze the excitation spectrum within rpa , time - dependent hf , and tddft@xcite and it was shown that these approximations provide a poor description of the spectrum in the non - perturbative limit .",
    "the hubbard dimer has also been applied as a toy model to examine models for the electronic self - energy beyond the gw approximation@xcite and it was shown that the gw approximation fails to describe the correlated electronic structure in the non - perturbative limit .",
    "the failure of the gw approximation to describe quasi - particle excitations in general hubbard models with large static correlation has also been demonstrated recently.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the performance of the bethe - salpeter equation was investigated for a hydrogen molecule and was found to yield unphysical ( imaginary ) excitation spectrum in the dissociation limit .",

    "we analyze the hubbard hamiltonian for a dimer and show how correlation energies are obtained within the framework of the adiabatic connection and fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the model .",
    "we also state the exact eigenstates and ground state energy for the model .",
    "various approximations to the correlation energy within the model is then investigated and compared with _ ab initio _ results .",
    "we start by calculating the exact response function and verify that it yields the correct ground state energy when the correlation energy is evaluated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we then proceed by examining the rpa , which yields a correct dissociation in the strict atomic limit and show that the sosex correction deteriorates this result as expected from first principles calculations.@xcite hedin s equations are then used to obtain approximations for the response function beyond rpa and we calculate correlation energies within the tdhf , bse and tdgw approximations .",

    "correctly.@xcite however , at intermediate distances the dissociation curves usually display a spurious maximum , which can differ by more than 1.0 ev from the exact dissociation curve .",
    "this has been reported both for the dissociation of h@xmath0@xcite as well as the dissociation of n@xmath0.@xcite time - dependent density functional theory calculations with an exact exchange kernel has also been shown to yield such a maximum , but reproduces the correct result in the strict atomic limit .",
    "in contrast , the hf and sosex corrected rpa calculations overestimate the energy in the dissociation limit by @xmath10 ev and @xmath11 ev respectively.@xcite    in the context of dft , we can define total energies as the sum of the exchange energy ( non - interacting plus hartree - fock ) and a correlation energy , which can be obtained from the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem ( acdft ) .",

    "theory ] we will go through the theory leading to the different approximations for @xmath15 in more detail .    the most famous approximation for @xmath15 is the rpa where one assumes a non - interacting polarization function .",
    "the theory and implementation has already been discussed in detail @xcite and the rpa dissociation curve of h@xmath0 is well known . however ,",
    "very limited work have been dedicated to going beyond rpa in the context of total energies and many - body perturbation theory . in contrast , for optical excitations in semiconductors , the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) provides a natural `` beyond rpa '' method that incorporated electron - hole interactions .",
    "the bse is implemented in several existing electronic structure codes , but it is usually applied to analyze the influence of electron - hole interactions on excited states and will typically just return the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function , which is calculated from the eigenvalues and eigenstates of an excitonic hamiltonian .",
    "it is , however straightforward to calculate the full response function from the eigenstates and eigenvalues and the bse correlation energy can then be obtained by performing a coupling constant integration .",

    "this is not a very accurate procedure and we can not claim that our bse calculations are completely converged .",

    "below we will calculate the interacting response function and correlation energies within various approximations .",
    "note , that the correlation energy always acquires a finite contribution from the non - interacting response function , which is composed of an electronic transition between a delocalized doubly occupied @xmath7-orbital ( @xmath68 ) and the @xmath69 state . in the atomic limit",
    ", finite order perturbation theory can never produce a term that exactly cancels the @xmath70 originating from first order perturbation theory .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this framework , the ground state energy can be decomposed into contributions originating from transitions to excited many - body eigenstates integrated along the adiabatic connection .",
    "the derivation of the response function shows that only the transition from @xmath71 to @xmath69 where both electrons are always located on the same site , contributes to the ground state energy . in the atomic limit",
    "the electrons are never localized on the same site in the ground state and the transition can be regarded as a pure charge transfer excitation .",
    "this implies that the transition matrix elements of the density operator should vanish in the atomic limit , which can be verified from the numerator of after having decomposed the expression into two terms with simple poles . in general , any good approximation of an interacting response function",
    ", should have the property that the amplitude of the charge transfer excitation vanishes in the atomic limit .",
    "this will show up as a vanishing numerator in the response function and translate into a correct correlation energy in the atomic limit .",
    "in contrast , the numerator of the non - interacting response function does not vanish since the non - interacting ground state always gives a probability of @xmath8 for finding both electrons at the same site .",
    "from the response function , we also calculate the exact polarizability which becomes @xmath72 the most important thing to note , is the fact that it is non - diagonal in spin . as we will see later , a rather advanced approximation ( tdgw ) is needed in order to introduce non - vanishing off - diagonal spin elements in the polarization function .",
    "it is also interesting to note that only the singlet pole corresponding to a transition to @xmath69 , becomes renormalized with respect to the poles of the response function .",

    "this is due to the lack of second order exchange in the rpa approximation . on the other hand , for @xmath51",
    "the expression nicely cancels the @xmath70 contribution from first order perturbation theory and total energy reduces to the non - interacting one in exact atomization limit .",
    "the rpa response function has a structure very similar to the exact response function .",
    "it consists of two terms representing transitions to @xmath66 and @xmath69 , which are a triplet and singlet respectively .",
    "the triplet excitation energy does not become renormalized with respect to the non - interacting transition energy , but does not contribute to the correlation energy .",
    "the singlet excitation contains all the correlation energy and its frequency integral vanishes for @xmath51 , which ensures the correct dissociation limit .",
    "it is instructive to represent the rpa response function in terms of electron - hole transitions . in the atomic limit",
    "the eigenstates of the electron - hole hamiltonian becomes @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a single - particle state at site @xmath79 ( see appendix [ app_hamilton ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the electronic transition contributing to the correlation energy becomes a pure charge transfer excitation in the atomic limit and the interacting response function thus vanishes .",
    "although the rpa can reproduce the exact atomic limit , the asymptotic behavior is very different from the exact result .",
    "the total rpa ground state energy approaches zero as @xmath80 , whereas the exact result vanishes much faster as @xmath81 ( see eq . ) .",
    "in fact , the exact ground state energy approaches zero monotonically with decreasing @xmath46 , whereas the rpa ground state energy has a maximum at @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83 scaling of the correlation energy in the atomic limit can already be recognized from the response function .",
    "decomposing the second term into two terms with single poles , we see that the numerators become proportional to @xmath83 , which indicates that the rpa transition matrix elements scales as @xmath84 .",
    "the sosex correction to rpa is inspired by the expansion of the rpa energy in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "the rpa can then be written as an infinite sum of direct ring diagrams which can be re - summed to yield a screened direct second order term .",
    "it is natural to add the associated exchange terms at each order in the perturbative expansion . in particular",
    ", this will ensure that the correlation energy of a single electron vanishes .",
    "such a contribution is called second order screened exchange ( sosex ) and the correction to the rpa correlation energy is    @xmath85    where @xmath86 and the screened interaction is @xmath87 here we have also written @xmath88 for short . for later reference",
    "we perform the integrations , which yield the expression @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 .",
    "however , the sosex correction to the correlation energy is obtained much easier by comparing with the rpa correlation energy , which can be written @xmath91 here a factor of four originates from the spin summations . rewriting the sosex correction",
    "a bit gives @xmath92    where the last equality was obtained by the substitutions @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath93 .",
    "comparing with the rpa expression then yields @xmath95 it is straightforward to verify that this is also obtained by explicit integration of eq . .",
    "the factor of two originates from the fact that the sosex contribution is diagonal in spin whereas the rpa contribution is independent of spin .",
    "the total correlation energy is then @xmath96 the sosex corrected correlation energy is exact within second order perturbation theory as expected from its construction .",
    "however , the expression does not cancel the first order contribution of @xmath70 in the non - perturbative limit and therefore predicts a wrong dissociation energy of @xmath97 for @xmath51 .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the sosex corrected correlation energy can not be written as an integral over a _",
    "reducible _ response function .",
    "as will be shown below , the sosex correction corresponds to an _ irreducible _ polarization function and therefore fits oddly into the present scheme of calculating correlation energies from the adiabatic connection .",
    "whereas the sosex correction seems like a natural extension of rpa from the point of view of many - body perturbation theory , we will now try to go beyond the rpa starting from hedin s equations eq . - .",
    "the rpa for the polarizability can be obtained by taking @xmath98 .",

    "iterating @xmath102 one time then yields @xmath103 where @xmath104 we recognize that this is exactly the sosex function appearing in eq .",
    ", however , since this is now part of an irreducible polarizability , we should evaluate the correlation energy from the dyson equation with @xmath105 .",

    "however , the resulting expression for the reducible response function is rather complicated so we will start by calculating the correlation energy resulting from a single bare coulomb interaction ( @xmath110 ) in the polarization .",
    "the spin - summed response with this approximation becomes @xmath111 with @xmath112 the trace of the response function evaluated at real frequencies can then be written @xmath113 with @xmath114 we see that the response function acquires complex poles even though the polarization function has real poles .",
    "this indicates that the approximation fails dramatically .",
    "however , we may still define the correlation energy in terms of the imaginary part of the response function even though this has complex poles corresponding to a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "the physical interpretation of the poles becomes obscure , but the correlation energy is real and well defined . in this particular case",
    "the poles constitute two complex conjugate pairs , which renders the response function real and the correlation energy defined from the dissipation fluctuation theorem vanishes .",
    "the exact same situation applies if we replace the bare interaction with a screened interaction and calculate the response function from @xmath115 , with @xmath107 given by eq . .",
    "one may naively think that a second order expansion ( in @xmath47 ) of this correlation energy should reproduce the second order rpa+sosex energy since only the rpa+sosex energy contributes to a second order expansion of eq . .",
    "however , a finite taylor expansion of eq . in @xmath47 is not well defined for all frequencies due to the poles in @xmath54 .",
    "we find it puzzling though , that the resummation yields complex poles at all values of @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that a simple iteration of the equation is not sufficient if we want a good approximation for @xmath54 and the situation seems to be similar to the dyson equation for @xmath15 , where a complete resummation of the dyson equation is needed in order to obtain a good approximation .          instead of simply including the first order correction in @xmath16 when calculating @xmath54 , it is possible to explicitly calculate the infinite series of diagrams that generate @xmath54 when we iterate @xmath102 an infinite number of times .",
    "in fact , one can show that the polarization function satisfies the four - point dyson equation @xmath116 where @xmath117 to proceed we will make a static approximation for @xmath118 and use @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , if we neglect the @xmath101-dependence in @xmath16 we obtain the bethe - salper approximation for p where @xmath120 the last delta function comes from the static approximation .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize that the bse polarization is diagonal in spin .",

    "it is very interesting that the poles become imaginary exactly at the degeneracy point .",
    "this indicates that below this point the lowest singlet and triplet states cross and the response function becomes ill - defined since the reference state is no longer the ground state .",
    "however , it should be noted that the poles themselves do not enter the expression for the correlation energy .",
    "rather it is the , matrix elements of the density operator corresponding to the transition associated with a certain pole .",
    "it is still interesting though , to compare the transition energies calculated within the different approximations and one would typically expect that the transition matrix elements are well approximated if the poles are accurate .",
    "we show the singlet and triplet poles calculated within various approximations in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] .",
    "these results are in good agreement with ab initio bse calculations for the hydrogen molecule.@xcite    again the triplet excitation does not contribute to the correlation energy since it is eliminated in the spin summation .",
    "the frequency integral of the response function ( evaluated at real frequencies ) becomes real for a purely imaginary pole and does not contribute to the correlation energy for @xmath128 .",
    "the appearance of imaginary poles signals a breakdown of the bse response function in the non - perturbative limit .",
    "however , from the point of view of the fluctuation dissipation theorem , the contribution to the correlation energy from the interacting response function , can be associated with the matrix elements @xmath129 .",
    "the imaginary poles simple means that @xmath130 for @xmath131 , whereas the exact condition is @xmath132 for @xmath133 . due to the coupling constant integration",
    "the correlation energy vanishes smoothly and provides an accurate description of the non - perturbative regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "traditionally , the @xmath16 function is interpreted as a screened coulomb potential . however , in molecular systems the interpretation of @xmath16 is not so clear and should be regarded as a auxiliary function , which should be calculated along with @xmath134 , @xmath54 , @xmath135 , and @xmath102 in order to solve the full many - body problem .",
    "for example , the exact @xmath16 for a one - electron system is @xmath136@xcite , which clearly differs from the exact coulomb interaction although there is no additional electrons to mediate the screening .",
    "since the physical interpretation of @xmath16 is not completely clear , we may try to simply replace it by the bare coulomb interaction @xmath137 in the expression for @xmath135 .",
    "this lead to the hartree - fock self - energy @xmath138 and the kernel becomes equal to ( four - point ) @xmath137 .",
    "the response function derived from this procedure is then called time - dependent hartree - fock .",
    "the polarization function , which is an infinite series of @xmath137-ladder diagrams can be re - summed to yield @xmath139 and the response function becomes @xmath140.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again the structure is very similar to both rpa and bse .",
    "the expression is in fact very similar to the rpa response function , the only difference being that the square of the two poles has been shifted by @xmath141 .",
    "this means that the tdhf approximation provides a renormalization of both the singlet and triplet excitations and not just the singlet excitation as was the case for rpa .",
    "furthermore the singlet pole is much closer to the exact value than that of rpa as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of the singlet pole seems to be better than that of bse , and never becomes imaginary . on the other hand",

    "the state does , however , not contribute to the correlation energy , which becomes @xmath143 note that a taylor expansion in @xmath47 gives the correct second order term @xmath144 as it should since tdhf is exact to second order .",
    "this was also the case for the sosex corrected rpa , but in contrast to tdhf , that approximation did not reproduce the correct dissociation limit",
    ". however , like rpa the asymptotic behavior in the non - perturbative limit is incorrect and the correlation energy goes as @xmath145 .",
    "thus it vanishes even slower than rpa and as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] it also has a spurious maximum which is situated even higher than in the case of rpa .",
    "this is perhaps surprising since the tdhf poles are much more accurate than the rpa poles .",
    "apparently , the rpa provides a better approximation for the transition matrix elements than tdhf although tdhf gives much more accurate poles .",
    "the bse polarization was derived by taking the @xmath146 approximation for the self - energy and approximating its @xmath134-functional derivative by @xmath16 . however , using a non - interacting polarization function , @xmath16 has a rather simple dependence on @xmath134 and we may carry out the functional derivative of @xmath16 .",
    "this gives ( integrations suppressed ) @xmath147 the functional derivative of the non - interacting polarization gives two terms and the the final results becomes @xmath148 the resulting polarization function is exact within the @xmath146 approximation and is referred to as time - dependent @xmath146 ( tdgw ) .",
    "again we will make a static approximation for the kernel , in order to solve a single frequency four - point dyson equation .",
    "an intriguing property of this approximation is that it does not yield a spin - diagonal polarization function .",
    "we know that the exact polarization is not diagonal in spin , but neither rpa , @xmath149 , bse of tdhf can yield off - diagonal spin blocks for the polarization .",
    "the spin summed response function is very similar to the bse case except that the poles are a bit more complicated .",
    "here we just give the spin summed response function which is @xmath150 where @xmath151\\big[4h^2t^2(h+t)^2 + 2h^2tu(h+t)^2\\\\ & + 2(h+t)^2(h^2 + 2t^2)u^2 - 4h^2tu^3\\big]/h^4(h+t)^2\\notag.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again the pole becomes imaginary when @xmath125 and the results of the approximation are very similar to bse .",
    "in fact , figs . [",
    "fig : poles ] and [ fig : model ] indicates that the tdgw results are slightly worse than the bse results .",
    "this could be related to the fact that the static approximation in tdgw is somewhat more drastic than the static approximation in bse .",
    "the bse four - point kernel only depends on a single frequency , whereas the fourier transform of the tdgw kernel depends on three independent frequencies , which are all set to zero in the static approximation .    .",
    "only hf and sosex do not give the correct dissociation limit of @xmath152 , but yields @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "rpa and tdhf yields large spurious maxima and decays very slowly towards dissociation , whereas bse and tdgw gives a rapid monotonous rise to dissociation in accordance with the exact results.,width=7 ]        here we will state the exact eigenvalues and and eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the fock space is spanned by the hilbert spaces corresponding to @xmath157 electrons .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of two electrons in the following .",
    "the hilbert space is then spanned by the six slater determinants : @xmath158 it is straightforward to diagonalize the hamiltonian in this basis and the eigenstates are @xmath159 when @xmath51 , we obtain the heitler - london solution where the second term of @xmath160 vanishes and the two electrons are never localized at the same site . in the non - interacting limit where @xmath161 , all the coefficients in @xmath160 become equal and the state can easily be rewritten as a doubly occupied bonding @xmath7-orbital , where the two electrons have a probability of @xmath8 for being localized on the same atom .",
    "in fact , any mean - field hamiltonian without two - particle operators will yield such a ground state and it is a non - trivial task to produce the correct ground state energy in the dissociation limit using the non - interacting state as a reference for perturbation theory .",
    "the associated eigenvalues are @xmath162 in the present work we are interested in the ground state energy , which can be written as @xmath163 from these expressions it is clear that it will be very challenging to derive an approximation for the ground state energy , which works well _ across coupling regimes_. starting from the non - interacting system and calculating perturbative corrections in @xmath47 will systematically generate the perturbation series eq . , but it is hard to see how such an approach would reproduce the atomic limit eq . .",
    "in particular , higher order terms in the perturbation series would have to cancel the @xmath164 terms , which are not present in eq . .",
    "in the present paper we calculate the ground state energy of the hubbard dimer within various approximations .",
    "the calculations are based on the non - interacting reference state , but involve non - perturbative contributions to the energy .",

    "the ground state of this hamiltonian is written @xmath168 and becomes the true interacting ground state for @xmath169 and the non - interacting ground state for @xmath170 .",

    "it is a convenient property of the model , which allow us to calculate total energies directly from the response function . in eq .",
    "we used that @xmath177 and the fact that @xmath15 is analytic in the upper right quarter of the complex plane in order to change the integration to the positive imaginary axis .",
    "we note that the retarded and time - ordered response functions coincide on the positive imaginary axis and we will not distinguish between these as long as we consider imaginary frequencies . in the following",
    "it will often be convenient to write the response function in terms of imaginary frequencies , since then it is not necessary to keep track of the positive infinitesimals , which shift the poles away from the real axis .",
    "we can always restore the dependence on real frequencies by taking @xmath178 and the hopping parameter @xmath179 .",
    "we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations of the dissociation curve of a hydrogen molecule using the rpa and bse approximations for the response function .",
    "both approximation produce the correct dissociation limit , but the bse result clearly improve the rpa description at intermediate distances and provides the qualitative correct monotonous rising dissociation curve . for the bse response function , we see the appearance of complex poles at strong coupling , but the correlation energy is real and only vanishes exactly in the strict atomic limit .",
    "these calculations are two orders of magnitude more time consuming than rpa calculations and is most likely to involved to be useful for routine _ ab initio _ electronic structure simulations at the moment .",
    "nevertheless , the steady increase in computer power may render the method useful in a few years and there is certainly room for optimization of the algorithm used here to obtain the correlation energies .    to obtain more insight into the physics contained in the different dissociation curves ,",
    "we have examined various approximations to the correlation energy of a hubbard dimer within many - body perturbation theory .",
    "comparison with the _ ab initio _ results show that this simple model is able to capture the qualitative features of a first principles treatment of molecular hydrogen in the dissociation limit .",
    "in particular , rpa provides the correct dissociation limit but displays a spurious maximum in the dissociation curves , whereas the sosex corrected rpa does not yield the correct dissociation limit .",
    "whereas the sosex energy can not be expressed in terms of an irreducible response function the expression itself corresponds to a polarization function resulting from a single iteration of the vertex equation with the gw self - energy .",
    "this inspired us to define a @xmath155 obtained by solving the dyson equation for @xmath15 using the `` sosex polarization '' @xmath149 .",
    "however , this approach yields a response function with complex poles in all of parameter space and indicates that a simple iterative approach to the vertex equation does not produce good approximations for the polarization function .",
    "instead , one has to solve the equation for the @xmath102 to obtain a fully renormalized vertex , which in turn produces good approximations for the polarization . with this method one obtains tdhf , bse or tdgw depending on the approximation used for the functional derivative of the self - energy and these approximations all yield the correct dissociation limit .",
    "in contrast to tdhf , bse and tdgw gives rise to monotonously increasing dissociation curves in accordance with the exact result .",
    "this implies that the screened interaction @xmath16 is a much better perturbative quantity than the bare interaction @xmath137 . in the case of metals",
    ", this is common knowledge and the physical origin of the screening is well understood . for molecules , however , it is less clear why the screened interaction appears and one should regard it as a auxiliary function which replaces @xmath137 in hedin s formulation of many - body perturbation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the poles of the singlet terms in the bse and tdgw response functions become imaginary in the non - perturbative limit .",
    "usually , one would regard this as a breakdown of the theory since it indicates that the spectrum is described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian , which indicates that time - evolution is not unitary . in the present context of ground state correlation energies ,",
    "the response function is just an object which allow us to approximate the correlation function @xmath156 , which is real by definition .",
    "the appearance of imaginary poles just implies that this correlation function vanishes at large coupling strength @xmath14 when @xmath47 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , due to the coupling constant integration , the correlation energy only vanishes exactly in the strict dissociation limit .    in the case of the hydrogen molecule",
    ", the exact dissociation curve can be obtained with the configuration interaction method @xcite but for more complicated systems such an approach becomes impossible . in solid state physics the mott insulators@xcite comprise a good example of systems where mean - field approaches typically fail due to strong static correlation .",
    "it will be interesting to see if many - body methods such as those investigated here can provide an accurate description of ground state properties in these systems .",
