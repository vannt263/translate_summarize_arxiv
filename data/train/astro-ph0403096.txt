    "the past 15 years have seen large advances in the capabilities of ground - based gamma ray detection , from the pioneering observation of the crab nebula by the whipple observatory in 1989@xcite to the new generation of air cherenkov telescope arrays such as hess@xcite , veritas@xcite , and cangaroo@xcite and large area air cherenkov telescopes such as stacee @xcite , celeste@xcite , and magic@xcite .",
    "there are now at least 10 known sources of very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma rays@xcite .",
    "the physics of these objects is astounding : from spinning neutron stars to super - massive black holes , these objects manage to accelerate particles to energies well in excess of 10 tev .",
    "how this acceleration occurs is not well understood and there is not universal agreement on what particles are being accelerated in some of these sources . at lower energies egret",
    "has detected over 270 sources of high - energy gamma rays@xcite and glast is expected to detect several thousand sources .",
    "in addition there are transient sources such as gamma - ray bursts that have to date eluded conclusive detection in the vhe regime ( despite some tantalizing hints@xcite ) .",
    "the paucity of vhe sources can be traced to the nature of the existing instruments : they are either narrow field instruments that can only view a small region of the sky at any one time and can only operate on clear moonless nights ( whipple , hegra , etc . ) or large field instruments with limited sensitivity ( milagro , tibet array ) .",
    "the milagro observatory has pioneered the use of a large area water cherenkov detector for the detection of extensive air showers . since an extensive air shower ( eas )",
    "array directly detects the particles that survive to ground level it can operate continuously and simultaneously view the entire overhead sky . with the observation of the crab nebula and the active galaxies mrk 421 and mrk 501 , milagro has proven the efficacy of the technique and its ability to reject the cosmic - ray background at a level sufficient to detect sources@xcite . at the same time",
    "the tibet group@xcite has demonstrated the importance of a high - altitude site and what can be accomplished with a classical scintillator array at extreme altitudes .    a detector with the all - sky and high - duty factor capabilities of milagro , but with a substantially lower energy threshold and a greatly increased sensitivity ,",
    "would dramatically improve our knowledge of the vhe universe .",
    "reasonable design goals for such an instrument are :    * ability to detect gamma - ray bursts to a redshift of 1.0 * ability to detect agn to a redshift beyond 0.3 * ability to resolve agn flares at the intensities and durations observed by the current generation of acts * ability to detect the crab nebula in a single transit    this paper describes a design for a next generation all - sky vhe gamma - ray telescope , the hawc ( high altitude water cherenkov ) array , that satisfies these requirements . to quantify the definition of observing `` short '' flares from agn ,",
    "previous measurements of flare intensities and durations by air cherenkov telescopes can be used .",
    "to date the shortest observed flares have had @xmath015 minute durations with an intensity of 3 - 4 times that of the crab@xcite .",
    "the low energy threshold needed to accomplish these goals requires that the detector be placed at extreme altitudes ( hawc would be situated at an altitude of @xmath04500 meters ) and the required sensitivity demands a large area detector - of order 40,000 m@xmath2 .",
    "section [ sec : particle_detection ] discusses the limiting performance of an eas array based on the properties of the eas , section [ sec : detector_description ] gives a physical description of the hawc and section [ sec : detector_performance ] details the expected performance of hawc .",
    "the ultimate performance of an eas array will be determined by the number , type , position , arrival time , and energy of the particles that reach the ground . here",
    "these properties of air showers are investigated to arrive at the limiting performance of eas arrays . to attain this level of performance",
    "an eas array would have to measure each of the above parameters with good precision .",
    "the most well - studied aspect of eas is the dependence of the number of particles to reach ground level on the observation altitude . for electromagnetic cascades ,",
    "approximation b is a good estimator of the average number of particles in an eas as a function of atmospheric depth .",
    "however , at the threshold of an eas array , it is the fluctuations in the shower development that determines the response of the detector . to incorporate the effect of shower fluctuations the event generator corsika ( version 6.003@xcite )",
    "is used to generate eas from gamma rays .",
    "the gamma rays were generated with an @xmath3 spectrum beginning at 10 gev , and uniformly over over the sky with zenith angles from 0 to 45 degrees .",
    "four different observation altitudes were studied : 2500 m , 3500 m , 4500 m , and 5200 m .",
    "figure [ fig : f1-altitude_effect ] shows the fraction of primary gamma rays that generated an air shower where more than 100 particles with energy above 10 mev survived to the observation level .",
    "the requirement that a particle have at least 10 mev in energy is imposed as a reasonable detection criterion and the requirement that 100 such particles survive enables one to examine the effects of altitude on the fluctuation spectrum of the air showers .",
    "this figure is a reasonable indication of the relative effective area of a fixed detector design as a function of the altitude of the detector . at high energies",
    "each km in altitude results in a factor of 2 - 3 increase in effective area . at low energies ( of relevance for extragalactic sources such as grbs ) the increase with altitude",
    "is larger .",
    "note that for primary energies between 100 gev and 500 gev a detector placed at 5200 m has @xmath4 times more effective area than the identical detector placed at 2500 m altitude ( close to the altitude of milagro ) . from this figure alone",
    "one can estimate that a detector roughly 10 times the size of milagro placed at 5200 m altitude would be of order 22 ( @xmath5 ) times more sensitive than milagro ( assuming the background scaled in a similar fashion ) .",
    "this level of sensitivity satisfies the requirements listed above .",
    "-0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    it is well known that gamma rays outnumber electrons and positrons in an air shower by a large factor .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma - electron_ratio ] shows the ratio of gamma rays to electrons ( @xmath110 mev ) for three observation altitudes : 3500 m , 4500 m , and 5200 m . over this altitude range the ratio of gamma rays to electrons is relatively independent of the observation level . at these low energies gamma rays outnumber electrons and positrons by an order of magnitude . therefore to attain the lowest possible energy threshold the detector must be sensitive to the gamma rays in the air shower",
    ".    an important feature of any gamma - ray detector is its ability to reject a significant fraction of the cosmic - ray background .",
    "the milagro detector has demonstrated that detecting and characterizing the penetrating component of an air shower is a reliable method of rejecting the cosmic - ray background@xcite . in figure [ fig : hadron_muon ] we show the average number of hadrons and muons in an air shower as a function of primary proton energy .",
    "an observation altitude of 5200 m is assumed in this figure .",
    "it should be noted that the fluctuations about these mean values are * not * poisson .",
    "but it is clear from this figure that the ability to detect showering hadrons in the air shower is important for the discrimination of the cosmic - ray background .",
    "this is especially true at low energies where the hadronic component is larger than the muon component .",
    "( hadrons are defined to be protons , anti - protons , neutrons , and pions . )",

    "are generated using corsika as above ( on an @xmath3 spectrum beginning at 10 gev ) , however only vertical showers were generated .",
    "this simplifies the reconstruction of the air shower .",
    "in what follows it is assumed that the position , time , and energy of each particle are measured exactly . since the direction of the individual particle is not utilized in what follows it may be possible to develop a detector with improved angular resolution , though at a rather large expense .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to give a detailed description of the fitting procedure .",
    "the leading edge of the eas is curved : particles farther from the core of the air shower arrive late relative to the particles at the core .",
    "studies of the corsika showers show that this curvature is dependent upon the individual energies of the shower particles .",
    "lower energy particles are delayed longer than higher energy particles . before using the arrival times of the particles to fit the direction of the primary gamma ray the particle arrival times",
    "must be corrected for this effect . to demonstrate the size of this effect figure [ fig : particle - point - spread ] shows the point spread function before and after this correction",
    "is applied to the particle arrival times ( for an observation altitude of 5200 m ) . the median angle error before the corrections are applied is 5.1 degrees and after the corrections are applied the median angle error is reduced to 0.8 degrees ( 71% of the events survive the complete fitting procedure ) .",
    "figure [ fig : particle - angle_comparealtitude ] shows the energy dependence of the mean of the point - spread function as a function of primary energy . for a fixed primary energy the angular reconstruction is improved by moving the detector to higher altitude .",
    "a detector at 4500 m would have the same angular resolution as a detector at 5200 m for gamma - ray primaries with 50% more energy .",
    "a detector at 3500 m altitude would require over a 100% increase in primary energy to obtain a similar angular resolution .",
    "-0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    -0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    because of the fluctuations in the shower development ( mainly the depth of the first interaction ) eas arrays have relatively poor energy resolution . to investigate the limiting energy resolution of an eas array primary gamma rays",

    "figure [ fig : eres - particles_compare ] shows the mean ( and the error on the mean ) number of particles on the ground as a function of primary energy for observation altitudes of 3500 m , 4500 m , and 5200 m . at an altitude of 5200 m there is a good correlation between the mean number of particles and primary energy at primary energies as low as 50 gev . at an altitude of 4500 m",
    "this correlation begins at about 100 gev in primary energy and at 3500 m altitude there is no correlation until the primary energy is about 250 gev . to estimate the energy resolution , the curves in figure [ fig : eres - particles_compare ] are fit to a power law in the number of particles that reach the ground ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of particles on the ground ) .",
    "figure [ fig : particle_eres_gt_50gev ] shows the distribution of @xmath8 for primary energies above 50 gev ( for an observation altitude of 5200 m ) .",
    "the resulting distribution is non - gaussian , but is fit reasonably well by a landau distribution ( shown on the figure ) .",
    "the asymmetric tail is an over - estimation of the particle energy and is inherent in the nature of the fluctuations in the depth of the first interaction . with a full width at half maximum of 0.5",
    "the equivalent size of the 1-sigma error bar would be @xmath025% ( if the distribution were gaussian ) .",
    "as one goes to higher energy primaries the distribution becomes narrower and more gaussian . at energies below 50 gev",
    "the energy resolution is significantly worse , with an rms greater than 1 .",

    "based on the above study and experience with the milagro detector a complete monte carlo simulation of a detector that is similar to milagro has been performed .",
    "the need to detect the gamma rays in the eas and the penetrating component of muons and hadronic cascades leads to a thick active detector .",
    "water is a natural and inexpensive choice of detecting medium .",
    "the cherenkov photons are relatively plentiful , prompt , and have large mean free paths ( relative to the water depth ) in clean water . since the cherenkov angle in water is 41@xmath9 , a detector spacing of roughly twice the detector depth ensures that there are no geometrical blind areas .",
    "( the depth and spacing were chosen to match that of milagro , though more work is needed to optimize these parameters . )",
    "the choice of a two layer design was again driven by experience with milagro .",
    "the deep layer makes a good calorimeter , whereas a shallow layer does not . in the shallow layer",
    "the detected light level depends critically on the exact geometry of the incoming particles , their distance from the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and incident angle .",
    "these fluctuations caused by the geometry of the incoming particles dilutes the energy measuring capability of a shallow layer of pmts .",
    "the ability to measure the energy of the shower particles is needed to determine the penetrating component of the air shower . in milagro",
    "this is the most useful method of rejecting the abundant cosmic - ray background .",
    "a shallow layer may be required to obtain the best possible angular resolution ( also important for rejecting the cosmic - ray background ) . since the speed of light in water is substantially different from the speed at which the particles propagate ( the speed of light in vacuum ) , the light and the particles diverge .",
    "this leads to an increase in the dispersion of the arrival time of the measured shower front as the depth of the measuring device is increased and the angular resolution is proportional to this spread .",
    "this effect is somewhat compensated for by the fact that a deeper layer typically makes more measurements of the shower front ( because each pmt can see a larger area of the water surface ) .",
    "the top layer may also be useful in the rejection of the cosmic ray background ( described below ) .",
    "work in better understanding these effects is still underway , but it may be possible to eliminate the shallow layer and maintain the performance of the detector .    in the remainder of this paper , the following detector characteristics are used .",
    "* 40,000m@xmath2 physical area ( 200m@xmath10200 m ) * 2.7 m spacing of pmts ( 74@xmath1074 pmts per layer ) * hamamatsu 20 cm pmts ( r5912sel ) * two layers of pmts . a shallow layer under 1.5 m of water and a deep layer under 6.5 m of water * an attenuation length of 20 meters , composed solely of absorption .",

    "will be referred to as the high altitude water cherenkov ( hawc ) array .",
    "to obtain realistic estimates of the sensitivity of hawc , the individual events must be reconstructed - their core position , direction , type ( hadronic or gamma ray ) , and energy need to be determined .",
    "preliminary algorithms have been developed to determine all of these parameters with the exception of the primary energy .",
    "work is ongoing in improving the existing algorithms and developing one to determine the energy of the primary gamma ray . in",
    "what follows , the events were generated beginning at 10 gev on an e@xmath11 spectrum ( similar to that observed for the crab nebula@xcite ) uniformly over incident direction .    as discussed above ,",
    "the shower front of an eas is not a true plane .",
    "therefore , the first step in performing an angular reconstruction is the determination of the core of the air shower .",
    "a simple center - of - mass algorithm using the pulse heights recorded in the pmts in the bottom layer of the detector is used to determine the shower core .",
    "figure [ fig : hawc - core_resolution4572 ] shows the distribution of core reconstruction errors in meters . for all events that trigger the detector and are successfully reconstructed ( see below ) the mean core error is 36 meters . despite the simplicity of the algorithm the core resolution is good enough that it does not degrade the angular resolution .",
    "the events with large core errors are those whose cores fall outside of the detector .",
    "the dashed line in the figure shows the core error for events whose core falls within the detector , the mean of this distribution is 20 meters .",
    "-0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    the angular reconstruction is performed in an analogous manner to that described above , however the timing correction that was applied based on the individual particle energies is replaced by a correction based upon the number of pes measured in each pmt . after applying this correction and a correction for the shower front curvature ( proportional to the distance from the pmt to the core of the shower ) the resultant times and positions to a plane .",
    "in addition the weight associated with each pmt is determined by the measured pulse height . though the weight also depends upon the distance to the shower core , this effect has been ignored in the following analysis .",
    "a 20 - 30% improvement in the angular resolution may be expected with an improved algorithm .",
    "this improvement should arise when the correlations between the two corrections ( core distance and pulse height ) are utilized and the weights assigned to each pmt incorporate the core distance .",
    "the fitting procedure is iterative , where the pmts that made large contributions to the chi - square are removed in subsequent iterations .",
    "events with more than 20 pmts surviving in the final iteration of the fitting procedure are considered to be successfully fit .",
    "the space angle difference between the true direction and the fit direction is shown in figure [ fig : hawc - angular_resolution4572 ] . using this point - spread function the signal to noise ratio is maximal for an analysis bin size of 1.2 degrees .",
    "if the point - spread function were gaussian this bin size would correspond to an angular resolution of 0.75 degrees@xcite .",
    "-0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    the ability to discriminate between gamma - ray induced air showers and hadronic air showers is critical to the success of any gamma - ray detector . unlike air cherenkov telescopes the background rejection discussed here is essentially independent of angular resolution .",
    "based on angular resolution alone with a 2sr field - of - view hawc ( and milagro ) remove roughly 99.93% of the background in their field - of - view . the background rejection discussed below",
    "is based purely on differences in the air showers regardless of their incoming direction .",

    "the figure caption gives the primary energy for each event .",
    "there are clear differences in morphology between proton and gamma - ray events .",
    "though there are some proton induced events that have a similar morphology to gamma - rays induced events , the events shown here are typical in the sense that most events have similar properties .",
    "note that while some of these events have very low primary energies , they are easily detected in hawc , striking many pmts .",
    "-0.3 in , title=\"fig : \" ]    milagro utilizes a parameter known as compactness that is defined as the ratio of the number of pmts in the bottom layer with more than 2 pes detected to the maximum number of pes measured in a single pmt in the bottom layer@xcite .",
    "hadronic showers tend to have small values of compactness and gamma ray showers a large value of compactness .",
    "the studies performed here indicate that as one moves to higher elevations the ability of this parameter to discriminate between hadronic and gamma - ray initiated cascades degrades .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of the milagro collaboration , who found that the background rejection capabilities of compactness improved as the zenith angle of the primary particle increased@xcite .",
    "however , a modified form for the compactness parameter , where the number of pmts with more than 2 pes is replaced with the number of pmts that are struck in the bottom layer , has a similar background rejection capability to that obtained by milagro .",
    "figure [ fig : hawc - compactness4572 ] shows this modified compactness parameter ( which will be referred to simply as compactness in what follows ) for proton ( dashed line ) and gamma ray ( solid line ) showers . if events are required to have a compactness greater than 8.3 one retains 66% of the gamma ray events and only 17% of the proton events , yielding a quality factor of 1.6 .",
    "( the quality factor is defined as the fraction of gamma - ray events that survive the cut divided by the square root of the number of proton events that survive the cut , and is the relative improvement in sensitivity of the detector . )",
    "another parameter that appears promising in discriminating gamma rays from background is the ratio of the number of pmts struck in the top layer ( @xmath12 ) to the number of pes in the brightest pmt in the bottom layer , where the pmts within 20 m of the fit shower core are excluded from the search for the maximum ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "the requirement @xmath14 retains 97.7% of the gamma ray events while rejecting 52.5% of the proton induced events .",
