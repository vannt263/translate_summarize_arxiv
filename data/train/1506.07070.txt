    "rydberg polaritons exhibit potentially strong and nonlocal mutual interactions making them interesting candidates to study many - body effects in the regime of strong correlations , where the interaction energy dominates the kinetic energy . in the present paper we consider the propagation of light in rydberg eit media under paraxial conditions in a one - dimensional setting , as can be realized experimentally by , e.g. , cigar - shaped atomic ensembles or sending photons through hollow - core optical fibers filled with rydberg atoms  @xcite . in a previous letter  @xcite we argued that the propagation of photons inside rydberg gases under eit conditions can be described in terms of interacting quasi - particles , named rydberg polaritons .",
    "we showed that a regime of strong correlations , where the ratio between interaction energy and kinetic energy becomes large , can be reached by dynamically turning photons into stationary rydberg excitations  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we extend these studies by deriving an effective dark - state polariton model including leading - order corrections valid for sufficiently large separation of rydberg polaritons .",
    "this regime allows for a perturbative treatment of the coupling between bright- and dark - state polaritons .",
    "we derive a lindblad master equation for the rydberg dark - state polaritons where the bright - state polaritons act as a markovian reservoir .",
    "we verify the model and address the preparation of an initial state by employing numerical two - excitation wave - function simulations .",
    "we derive conditions for when the master equation can be reduced to the effective hamiltonian introduced in  @xcite .",

    "we show that under continuous driving conditions and large optical depth per blockade distance the regime of strong interactions can not be entered since the rydberg blockade prevents to reach the polariton densities necessary for the interaction energy to overcome kinetic contributions .",

    "we derived conditions where the losses in the effective rydberg polariton model are negligible and we can use an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the ground - state properties of this hamiltonian were analyzed using numerical dmrg simulations and in terms of a luttinger liquid model .",
    "we showed that the regime of strong interactions , quantified by the ratio of interaction to kinetic energy @xmath389 is very difficult to reach under stationary eit conditions . increasing the strength of the rydberg interaction leads to an increase of the eit blockade distance , which prevents to reach sufficiently large polariton densities to enter the strong - interaction regime .",
    "however , making use of a dynamical slow - down of rydberg polaritons while propagating inside the medium or a storage protocol of polaritons in stationary spin excitations allows to decrease the kinetic energy by increasing their effective mass without reducing the quasi - particle density . in this way it is possible to generate a quasi - crystalline or a charge - density wave ( cdw ) state of stored photons , which is a highly non - classical state consisting of an ordered string of single - photon wave - packets",
    "this state can be observed by either nonadiabatic release of the stored excitations into a train of single photons or by direct imaging of the rydberg ensemble as in  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed this storage in terms of a time - dependent luttinger liquid model and showed that the gapless model leads to a spatial crossover in the cdw correlations between an adiabatic regime , exhibiting strong spatial correlations and a diabatic regime , where the correlations show the initial power - law decay .",
