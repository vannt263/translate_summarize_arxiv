    "distributed flows are ubiquitous in natural and man made systems .",
    "examples of such distributed flows include but are not limited to : water flow in riverbeds , data flow on the internet , current flow in the power grid , nutrient flows in leaves . by studying real - world transport systems",
    ", a natural question appears as how such flows can be designed in order to optimize various transport characteristics , collectively referred to as objective functions , e.g. searchability @xcite , transport efficiency @xcite , average packets traveling time @xcite , resilience against cascading overloads @xcite and against damages @xcite .    in a large class of transport models in networks",
    ", flow is assumed to be limited to and directed along the shortest paths between the source and destination @xcite . in another class of flow models , motivated primarily by search and discovery in networks , routing of packets",
    "can be random , which have led to the studies of regular @xcite , weighted @xcite , or adaptive random walks ( rws ) in networks @xcite . in between these two extremes",
    "lies a class of models where transport and flow is both directed and distributed : packets or information flow are distributed among _ all possible paths _ emanating from the source and ending at the target node . in this paper",
    "we systematically study the simplest such example of a directed , distributed flow : _ currents in resistor networks_.    resistor networks are arbitrary networks in which all edges are resistors with a specific  electrical \" conductance and a pair of nodes have been designated to be the source and sink ( target ) of a current @xmath2 flowing through the network .",
    "they have not only been used to capture inherent transport capabilities of the underlying ( possibly weighted ) complex communication or information networks @xcite , but also to describe the transport of carbohydrates in plants @xcite , to investigate flow of fluids in porous media @xcite , to find communities in complex networks @xcite , or to construct page - ranking schemes for search engines @xcite .",
    "further , there are fundamental connections between random walks ( hitting times ) and resistor networks ( two - point resistance ) @xcite .",
    "these fundamental observables ( and the corresponding load and betweenness measures ) can also serve as a starting point in routing schemes in actual communication networks @xcite .    here , we present extensive and systematic numerical results pertaining to two general cases of relative node processing capabilities along with the effect of bandwidth on current flows in weighted resistor networks . in the following section ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) we describe the model we use to study distributed flows . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we study numerically the effect of two different node capacities and bandwidth upon flow efficiency . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we present results about maximizing network robustness against cascading failures , and present concluding remarks in sec .",
    "in this paper we consider a specific scheme of assigning conductances to edges @xmath3 edge weighting scheme@xmath3 and study how the parameter in this scheme affects the efficiency of flow and robustness of the network to cascading failures .",
    "consider a resistor network having @xmath4 nodes and @xmath5 edges .",
    "the conductance of an arbitrary edge @xmath6 is set to be proportional to the end - point degrees , namely @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 element of the network s adjacency matrix and @xmath1 is a _",
    "control parameter _ , taking only real values .",
    "this choice , also studied before in @xcite , has been motivated by empirical studies @xcite where edge weights were observed to follow a similar trend .",
    "an additional motivation is that this scheme provides a convenient way of studying topologically ( structurally ) biased flows as a function of @xmath1 control parameter .",
    "this parameter allows one to bias the current flow predominantly towards large degree nodes ( hubs ) ( for positive @xmath1 ) or to avoid them ( for negative @xmath1 ) .",
    "when @xmath10 , all edge weights are equal , thus the current flow is solely influenced by the network topology .",
    "currents along the edges of the network are obtained following the method summarized in @xcite . when @xmath2 units of current flow into the network at a source @xmath11 and leave at a target @xmath12 , then for an arbitrary node @xmath13 , charge conservation ( kirchoff s law ) combined with ohm s law dictates : @xmath14 keeping in mind that the weighted network laplacian can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , the system of linear equations ( [ eq : charge ] ) can be transformed into the matrix equation @xmath17 @xmath18 is the unknown column voltage vector , while @xmath19 is the net current flowing into the network at node @xmath13 , which is zero in all cases except the source and target nodes .",
    "equation [ eq : matrixform ] is solvable for voltages , as long as the inverse of the laplacian @xmath20 is known . as",
    "the @xmath20 matrix is singular ( all rows and columns of @xmath20 sum up to zero implying that there is an eigenvalue @xmath21 with a corresponding constant eigenvector ) it can not be directly inverted .",
    "this , however presents no technical difficulty , as all relevant physical observables can be expressed in terms of the inverse ( or pseudo - inverse ) laplacian , defined in the space orthogonal to the zero mode : @xmath22 .",
    "this is achieved by using spectral decomposition of the network laplacian @xcite .",
    "for example , by choosing the reference potential to be the mean voltage @xcite , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , one obtains : @xmath25 for each node @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for _ @xmath2 units of current _ and for _ a given source / target pair _ , the current flowing through an arbitrary edge @xmath6 is @xmath26 while the current flowing through node @xmath13 is given by @xmath27 where the sum is taken over all neighbors of node @xmath13 .",
    "so far we have considered the general case of @xmath2 units of current entering ( leaving ) the network at a given source ( target ) pair . for the studies in this paper , with the exception of sec .",
    "[ sec4b ] , we assume that _ unit current _ flows between _ @xmath4 source / target pairs _ simultaneously .",
    "specifically , we assume that all nodes are simultaneously sources and unit current flows into the network at each source . for each source",
    "node a target is chosen randomly and uniformly from the remaining @xmath28 nodes .",
    "consequently , the net current flowing through an arbitrary edge / node gives the edge / node current - flow betweenness @xcite : @xmath29 note , @xmath30 , where the sum is over all neighbors of node @xmath13 .",
    "these quantities capture appropriately the amount of information passing through an edge or a link in a distributed fashion , and therefore we will refer to them as edge and vertex loads .",
    "we clarify , this is different from the quantity ` vertex load ' introduced in @xcite , defined as the accumulated number of data packets passing through a vertex when all pairs of nodes send and receive a data packet in unit time transmitted along the shortest paths connecting them .",
    "currents along the edges and nodes are uniquely determined by the network topology and the weight exponent @xmath1 . therefore , this is a fully deterministic model and the only source of randomness in the problem is in the network structure .",

    "having considered the load landscapes for different @xmath1 ranges , we are interested in how to characterize the flow efficiency in the network . here , we characterize traffic flow efficiency by network throughput @xcite : the maximum input current @xmath55 that the network is able to transport without becoming congested . to begin with",
    ", we consider two cases . in the first case _ ( i ) _ which we call _ node - limited _ , nodes have identical processing capability , set to unity , and edges have transport capacity ( which is also interchangeably referred to as bandwidth ) @xmath56 that is unbounded ( @xmath57 ) . in the second case _",

    "[ fig4](c ) ] , essentially unchanged from uncorrelated scale - free graphs .",
    "this behavior of general disassortative networks can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "assuming that the scaling of the vertex load is dominated by the weighted degree @xmath73 for each node , one can show that the value of @xmath1 which balances the vertex loads will be lower for disassortative networks ( such as the internet ) than for uncorrelated ones .",
    "therefore , a stronger hub avoidance is required to balance the loads on a disassortative network as compared to an uncorrelated one . on the other hand , assuming that the edge load is dominated by the weighted couplings @xmath74 [ eq .

    "the monotonicity of function @xmath149 for all values of @xmath1 indicates that network robustness is solely determined by network topology and link conductances for a fixed value of @xmath132 excess load capacity .",
    "we have studied the problem of optimizing the throughput and robustness of networks carrying distributed flows , from a design perspective . specifically , we have used a formalism where the coupling between ( local ) network structure and the conductance of individual links can be tuned to get the best results for a given objective .",
    "this approach has been inspired by the observation of correlations between link ` weights ' and local topology in various man - made and natural systems @xcite . whether these systems are tuned for optimal throughput or robustness",
    "is an open question , although there have been some indications of biological systems operating in a near - optimal regime @xcite .",
    "analogous weighting schemes have been proven to be efficient for optimizing flow in rw @xcite and shortest path routing @xcite , and also for optimizing spreading @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper has been to systematically consider the optimization of throughput for distributed flows under various cases .",
    "we find that in uncorrelated scale - free and er networks , for identical flows between all sources and sinks and identical node capacities , each set to unity , hub - avoiding flows provide optimal throughput in the node - limited case , while weakly hub - biased flows do the same in the edge - limited case .",
    "the same trend is observed qualitatively for the internet @xcite , and also when the flows are heterogeneous , i.e. , when current between each source - target pair scales as the product of their degrees .",
    "interestingly though , if the capacities of nodes are also distributed heterogeneously ( still conserving the total capacity ) , the optimal throughput occurs for a hub - biased flow . as mentioned earlier",
    ", this has possible implications for the case of airline transportation network where a similar hub - biased flow is empirically observed .",
    "furthermore , flows on the links of metabolic networks have also been observed to be hub - biased , although a complete analogy to our distributed flow model there is unclear .",
    "although similar trends favoring hub - avoiding flows and weakly hub - biased flows for node and edge - limited cases , respectively , are found for shortest path flows , for large systems , perhaps not surprisingly , distributed flows are more efficient at minimizing the maximal load on the network , and thus providing greater throughput .",
    "finally , we studied how the robustness of a network to cascading failures could be optimized within the parameters of our model .",
    "our results indicate that for small amounts of excess capacity , networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are maximally robust in the regime of hub - avoiding flows .",
