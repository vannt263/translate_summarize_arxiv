    "secondary cosmic ray ( cr ) isotopes such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and are believed to be produced as a results of of nuclear interactions primary crs such as @xmath2 , @xmath5 or with the gas nuclei of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . the secondary cr abundances depend on the intensity of their progenitors nuclei , their production rate and their transport in the turbulent magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "secondary to primary ratios such as @xmath3/@xmath5 , @xmath4/@xmath5 or / be used to study the cr propagation processes in the galaxy . the / ratio",
    "is widely used to determine the key parameters of propagation models .",
    "in fact the / ratio is measured by several experiments between @xmath0100mev and @xmath01tev of kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "the cr propation physics is also connected with the indirect search of dark matter particles . in this context",
    "the cr propagation models , once tuned to agree with the / ratio , are used to compute the secondary production for other rare species such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 , that provides the _ astrophysical background _ for the search of new physics signals @xcite .",
    "clearly , understanding the cr propagation processes is crucial for modeling both the cr signal and the background .",
    "furthermore , these studies assume that all the cr species experience the same propagation effects in their journey thourghout the ism @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to test the cr propagation with nuclei of different mass - to - charge ratios .",
    "this issue of the _ universality _ of cr propagation histories was also studied in @xcite and , recently , in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the recent -01 observations for the @xmath3/@xmath5 and @xmath4/@xmath5 ratios and compare them with the expected ratios based on interstellar and heliospheric propagation calculations .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine wether the -01 observations are consistent with the propagation calculations derived from heavier nuclei ( mainly from / data ) .",
    "this consistency is inspected within two classes of model uncertainties : the _ astrophysical uncertainties _ , which are related to the knowledge of the cr transport parameters given by the / ratio , and the _ nuclear uncertainties _ , which arise from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 production cross sections .",
    "the -01 experiment operated successfully in the sts-91 mission on board the space shuttle _ discovery_. the spectrometer was composed of a cylindrical permanent magnet , a silicon micro - strip tracker , time - of - flight scintillator planes , an aerogel erenkov counter and anti - coincidence counters .",
    "the performance of -01 is described elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "results on isotopic spectra have been recently published in @xcite with the ratios @xmath3/@xmath5 , @xmath4/@xmath5 , @xmath6/@xmath7 , @xmath7/(@xmath13+@xmath8 ) and @xmath8/@xmath9 in the range @xmath14 gev of kinetic energy per nucleon .",

    "the -01 observations are made in a period , 1998 june , of relatively quiet solar activity , and the particle recorded are free from any atmospheric induced background .",
    "furthermore , the -01 material thickness between the top of the payload and the active detector amounted to @xmath05g@xmath15 which is considerably less than that of previous balloon borne experiments ( @xmath0920g@xmath15 of top - of - instrument material plus @xmath05g@xmath15 of residual atmosphere ) . also important , for the aims of this work , is to realize that high precision data are currently flowing in from two active projects pamela and -02 , both operating in space . in particular ,",
    "the data forthcoming by are expected to provide a dramatic improvement in our understanding of the cr transport processes and interactions @xcite .",
    "galactic cr nuclei are believed to be accelerated by particle diffuse shock acceleration mechanisms occurring in galactic sites such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "their propagation in the ism is dominated by particle transport in the turbulent magnetic field and interactions with the matter , that is generally described by a diffusion - transport equation including source distribution functions , magnetic diffusion , energy losses , hadronic interactions , decays , diffusive reacceleration and convective transport ( the latter is not considered in this work ) .",
    "models of cr propagation in the galaxy employ fully analytical @xcite , semi - analytical @xcite , or fully numerical calculation frameworks @xcite .",
    "the present work relies on the _ diffusive - reacceleration _ model implemented with ` galprop - v50.1p ` , which numerically solves the cosmic ray propagation equation for a cylindrical diffusive region with a realistic interestellar gas distribution and source distribution .",

    "the other parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ the source parameters and the modulation potential , are kept fixed . for each parameter configuration , we select the /-compatible models within one sigma of uncertainty in the @xmath82 statistics .",
    "we use / data from heao @xcite , cream @xcite , -01 @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig::ccheliumdeuteronxs ] illustrates the uncertainty band derived by this procedure .",
    "note that this method has severe limitations and allows to simultaneusly explore only some parameters .",
    "more robust strategies require advanced statistical tools , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , @xcite and in particular @xcite .",
    "however the purpose in this work is estimating the parameter uncertainties rather than determining their exact values .",
    "the _ nuclear uncertainties _ on the @xmath3 and @xmath4 calculations are those arising from uncertainties in their production cross sections . in order to estimate the cross section uncertainties using the information from the measurements ,",
    "we re - fit the parametrizations with the data to determine their overall normalizations and associated errors .",
    "the uncertainty bands are shown in fig.[fig::ccheliumdeuteronxs ] for the main reactions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 production .",
    "these uncertainties can be directly translated into error bands for the predicted ratios @xmath3/@xmath5 and @xmath4/@xmath5 .",
    "these uncertainty bands are shown in fig.[fig::ccisotoperatios2x2 ] .",
    "the -01 data agree well with calculations within the astrophysical band , indicating consistency with the propagation picture arising from the / analysis .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath83 nuclear ratios carry valuable information on the transport parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , they can be in principle used to tighten the constraints given by the / ratio . on the other hand , the _ nuclear uncertainties _",
    "represent an intrinsic limitation on the accuracy of the model predictions , as reported in the right panels of the figure . only precise cross section data or more refined calculations",
    "may pin down these uncertainties .",
    "unaccounted errors or systematic biases in cross section estimates cause errors on the predicted ratios which , in turn , may lead to a mis - determination of the cr transport parameters . given the level of precision expected from pamela or -02 , systematic errors in the cross section data may represent the dominant source of uncertainty for the model predictions of light cr isotopes .",
    "a strategy to check the model consistency with cr data is the use of secondary to secondary ratios such as @xmath3/@xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 isotopes have the same astrophysical origin and simlar progenitors ( mainly @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , their ratio is almost unsensitive to the propagation physics and can be used to probe the net effect of the nuclear interactions .",
    "in fact , a mis - consistency between calculations and @xmath3/@xmath4 data would indicate the presence of systematic biases in the cross sections that can not be re - absorbed by the propagation parameters .",
    "as illustrated in the bottom panels of fig.[fig::ccisotoperatios2x2 ] , the tight astrophysical uncertainty band ( left ) indicates a little discrepancy between data and model which can be understood if one consider the nuclear uncertainty ( right ) , which is dominant for the @xmath3/@xmath4 ratio .",
    "similarly , the use of other ratios such as @xmath6/@xmath7 , / or @xmath8/@xmath9 can represent a useful diagnostic tool for testing the overall consistency of the model .",
    "we have compared new observations of the @xmath3/@xmath5 and @xmath4/@xmath5 ratios in crs made by the -01 experiments with standard calculations of secondary production in the ism .",
    "these ratios are well described by propagation models consistent with / ratio under a _ diffusive - reacceleration _ scenario , suggesting the he and heavier nuclei such as experience similar propagation histories .",
    "the accuracy of the secondary cr calculations relies on the accuracy of the cross sections employed .",
    "given the level of precision expected from -02 , the errors in the cross section data will likely represent the dominant source of uncertainty for the model predictions of rare cr isotopes such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "similar issues may concern for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , or @xmath86 .",
    "these errors may be reduced using more refined calculations or more precise accelerator data .",
    "for example , future observations may require the departure from the straight - ahead approximation which is generally assumed in the cr propagation studies for light nuclei .",
    "possible consistency checks for propagation models can be done using the secondary to secondary ratios , which are less sensitive to the astrophysical aspects of the interstellar cr propagation .",
    "the use of ratios such as @xmath3/@xmath4 , @xmath6/@xmath7 or @xmath8/@xmath9 can represent a useful diagnostic test for the reliability of the calculations : any cr propagation model , once tuned on secondary to primary ratios , must correctly reproduce the secondary to secondary ratios as well .",
    "another model limitation concerns the solar modulation effect .",
    "any more refined modeling requires to leave the force field approximation , that may be too simple to finely reproduce the future data of different @xmath87 isotopes .",
    "our understanding of the cr heliospheric propagation may be dramatically improved by the -02 long - term observations of different cr species .",
