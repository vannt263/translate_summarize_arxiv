    "[ sec : intro ]    the origin of the distribution of mass and angular momentum in disk galaxies is still an open issue , despite its long history .    the archetypical model of eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) provides a useful framework , in which a disk galaxy ( the milky way ) forms by centrifugal support of a collapsing gas cloud .",
    "mestel ( 1963 ) added the assumption that the specific angular momentum of each mass element , @xmath2 , is conserved during the collapse , and demonstrated that the final mass profile of the disk could then be related to the initial mass and angular momentum distribution of the gas .",
    "the key is that the cumulative mass with specific angular momentum less than @xmath2 , @xmath13 , is preserved during the collapse .",
    "crampin & hoyle ( 1964 ) ( also innanen 1966 ; freedman 1970 ) then realized that the observed exponential density profiles of disk galaxies in circular motions are consistent with the angular momentum distribution of a hypothetical uniform sphere in solid body rotation , @xmath14 \\label{eqt : iso}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 with @xmath16 the fixed angular velocity and @xmath17 the radius of the sphere , and @xmath18 the total mass of the sphere .",
    "fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) re - examined this question in the context of the more modern view according to which disk galaxies form from contracting gas within extended dark - matter halos ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "they added the assumption that the gas and dark matter were initially well - mixed such that the distribution of @xmath2 in the disk is equal to that of the halo . rather than assuming an angular momentum profile , they implicitly deduced it from the constraint that the final surface density profile of the disk is exponential .",
    "the implied disk scale radius , @xmath19 , is related to the total pre - collapse angular momentum of the halo , roughly @xmath20 . here , @xmath7 is the dimensionless spin parameter ( e.g. peebles 1969 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22,@xmath23 and @xmath10 are the total angular momentum , energy and mass of the system , and @xmath24 is newton s constant .",
    "angular momentum is presumably acquired by the dark matter ( and gas ) through tidal interactions with neighboring objects ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "barnes & efstathiou ( 1987 ) ( following efstathiou & jones 1979 ; efstathiou & barnes 1983 ; zeldovich & novikov 1983 ) utilized cosmological n - body simulations with a cdm power spectrum to make detailed predictions for halo angular momentum structure and statistics . in particular",
    "they found that the distribution of spin parameters is roughly log normal , with a median value of @xmath25 .",
    "they also confirmed that the angular momentum of pre - collapse halos grows roughly linearly with time , as predicted by linear tidal - torque theory ( doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) .",
    "several numerical and analtyical investigations have followed , which confirmed the nature of the @xmath7 distribution , addressed the alignment of the spin vectors between neighboring galaxies , the ( lack of ) dependence of halo spin on environment , and the effect of major mergers on halo spin ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "1988 ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; zurek , quinn & salmon 1988 ; warren et al .",
    "1992 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; lemson & kauffmann 1997 ; gardner 2000 ) .",
    "armed with this global information about the initial state of the dark matter and gas mixture , several authors have used the above disk formation scenario to predict observable quantities .",
    "blumenthal et al . ( 1986 ) addressed the rotation curves of disk galaxies in the context of the cdm hierarchical formation scenario , assuming @xmath26 of the mass in the gas component ( blumenthal et al .",
    "they pointed out that the non - dissipative dark halo should react to the dissipative gas infall by considerable contraction , and showed that this process can be approximated using an adiabatic invariant .",
    "this coupling between the halo and the disk  conspires \" to produce a continuity between the disk - dominated and halo - dominated regions of the rotation curves , as observed ( burstein & rubin 1985 ) .",
    "flores et al . ( 1993 ) explored the dependence of the final rotation curves on a range of assumed parameters , including the measured spread in @xmath7 .",
    "dalcanton , spergel , & summers ( 1997 ) included a more realistic initial halo density profile ( hernquist 1990 ) and explored the properties of both high surface brightness and low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "mo , mao , & white ( 1998a ; 1998b , 1999 ) performed a similar examination within the context of various cosmologies , assuming that the dark halos followed the density profile advocated by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 , 1997 ; nfw ) and compared their predicted galaxy properties to both local and high - redshift data .",
    "van den bosch ( 1998 ; 2000 ) and van den bosch & dalcanton ( 2000 ) extended the approach to include a bulge component and investigated the origin of the hubble sequence of galaxy types and other aspects of galaxy formation .",
    "the main commonality in all of these investigations is that the variation in observable galaxy properties depends almost exclusively on the initial total spin parameter of the halo hosting the galaxy .",
    "however , all of the predictions rest on the implicit assumption that , if specific angular momentum is conserved , the initial angular momentum profiles of the halos produce disks that are exponential in form .",
    "profile was that of a uniform solid body rotator , which produces disk density profiles that are similar to exponential ( ryden & gunn 1987 ) but only over about two disk scale lengths ( olivier , primack , & blumenthal , 1991 ) . ]    within this simple framework for disk formation , the key missing ingredient is the actual distribution of angular momentum in halos . partially motivated by this , we set out to measure the @xmath2 profiles directly using a statistical sample of halos in a high resolution simulation , and to estimate the intrinsic scatter in these distributions .",
    "the long - term goal is to learn what the detailed form of halo angular momentum profiles can teach us about the origin of galaxy types , disk surface brightness profiles , and bulge properties .",
    "an additional strong motivation for this study comes from the results of hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation in a cosmological context . unlike the simplified , monolithic - collapse framework discussed above , the hydrodynamic treatments model gas cooling within the hierarchical growth of dark halos , and typically find that the resulting disks are significantly smaller than real galactic disks ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) . the problem apparently arises because most of the mass is accreted through mergers with objects whose gas component has already cooled and clumped , causing a large fraction of their angular momentum to be transferred to the dark halo or transported outwards . since angular - momentum transport is likely to always be from the inside out , the simple case in which @xmath2 is conserved during the collapse , which we can study in detail with high accuracy , can serve as a useful limiting case .",
    "this will provide a better basis for addressing the more complex physical processes required for solving the angular - momentum problem seen in the hydro simulations .    in we describe our methods , including the simulation and halo finding , the measurement of the spin parameter , the associated errors , and the measurement of the angular - momentum profile . in",
    "we discuss the measured ( universal ) mass distribution of angular momentum in halos . in",
    "we address the spatial distribution of angular momentum , its alignment , cylindrical symmetry , and profile in spherical shells . in",
    "we use both tidal - torque theory and an estimate of angular momentum transfer due to minor mergers to explore the origin of the angular - momentum profile . in we briefly describe the implications for the disk surface density profile and the  angular momentum catastrophe \" .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in .",
    "an appendix is devoted to testing our results with a simulation having @xmath27 times the mass resolution , and investigating @xmath13 profiles of halos at high redshift .",
    "large cosmological n - body simulations have reached the stage where detailed structural properties of many dark - matter halos can be resolved simultaneously . a method which allows the required force and",
    "mass resolution is the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) method ( kravtsov , klypin , & khokhlov 1997 ) which implements successive refinements of the spatial grid and time steps in high density environments .",
    "the simulations based on the art code provide a statistical sample of halos , covering a wide mass range , with the resolution appropriate for studying angular - momentum profiles .",
    "we have used the art code to simulate the evolution of collisionless dark matter within the  standard \" low - density flat @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 at @xmath32 ) .",
    "the simulation followed the trajectories of @xmath33 particles within a periodic box of comoving size @xmath34 from redshift @xmath35 to the present .",
    "a basic @xmath36 uniform grid was used , and six refinement levels were introduced in the regions of highest density , implying a dynamic range of @xmath37 .",
    "the formal resolution of the simulation is thus @xmath38 , and the mass per particle is @xmath39 .",
    "our halo finding algorithm ( bullock et al",
    ". 2000 ) is based on the bound density maxima technique ( klypin & holtzman 1997 ) and has been specifically designed to identify halos ( and subhalos ) in such a high resolution simulation . in the current study of angular momentum , we limit ourselves to ` distinct ' halos , which do not reside within a larger host halo , in the mass range @xmath40 . in the appendix",
    ", we use a higher resolution simulation to extend our mass range down to @xmath41 .",
    "a brief description of the halo finder is as follows : after finding all the maxima in the smoothed density field of the simulation , we unify overlapping maxima , define a minimum number of particles per halo ( say 50 ) , and iteratively find the center of mass of a sphere about each of the remaining maxima .",
    "we compute the spherical density profile about each center and identify the halo virial radius @xmath42 inside which the mean overdensity has dropped to a value @xmath43 , based on the top - hat spherical infall model . for the family of flat cosmologies ( @xmath44 ) , the value of @xmath43 can be approximated by ( bryan & norman 1998 ) @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . in the  model used in the current paper",
    ", @xmath43 varies from about 180 at @xmath47 to @xmath48 at @xmath32 .",
    "we then fit each halo density profile with a universal functional form .",
    "we adopt the nfw profile , @xmath49 with the two free parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "an equivalent pair of parameters is , for example , the virial mass @xmath52 and the concentration parameter @xmath53 . using this fit , we iteratively remove unbound particles from each modeled halo , and unify every two halos that overlap in their @xmath50 and are gravitationally bound .",
    "the modeling of the halos with a given functional form allows us to assign to them characteristics such as a virial mass and radius , and to estimate sensible errors for these quantities .",
    "the halo finding is 100% complete for halos of more than @xmath54 particles , @xmath55 ( see sigad et al .",
    "2000 ) . for our purpose here , we limit the sample to halos of more than @xmath56 particles .",
    "a first step towards measuring the distribution of specific angular momentum within each of the halos is measuring the _ global _ spin parameter of each halo .",
    "the angular momentum of a halo of @xmath0 particles is defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the position and velocity of the @xmath60th particle with respect to the halo center of mass . in principle , given the spin parameter @xmath7 , the value of the global specific angular momentum , @xmath61 , can be determined by using an assumed energy content for the halo in . in practice , however , this is not a straightforward procedure .",
    "for example , the energy of a halo in a crowded region is somewhat ambiguous because it depends on the environment .",
    "a related difficulty arises when only a sub - volume of the virial sphere is concerned , e.g. , within the cooling radius .",
    "we therefore define an alternative and more practical spin parameter by @xmath62 given the angular momentum @xmath22 inside a sphere of radius @xmath17 containing mass @xmath10 , and where @xmath63 is the halo circular velocity at radius @xmath17 , @xmath64 .",
    "this spin parameter reduces to the standard @xmath7 when measured at the virial radius of a truncated singular isothermal halo .",
    "the value of @xmath65 turns out to be robust to the choice of an outer radius ; we use below the virial radius @xmath42 , but we find a very similar distribution of @xmath65 values when using @xmath66 instead .",
    "this allows modelers to freely scale our results using any desired outer radius appropriate for the problem at hand .",
    "the spin parameters @xmath65 and @xmath7 are in fact very similar for typical nfw halos .",
    "they are related by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the energies of virialized halos with isothermal and nfw density profiles respectively , and @xmath70 $ ] ( mo et al .",
    "1998)./[\\cvir -   ( 1+\\cvir)\\ln(1+\\cvir)]^2 $ ] . ]",
    "the function @xmath71 is about unity for typical concentrations , @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath65 over the @xmath73 halos in our sample is shown in .",
    "it is well fit by a log - normal distribution , @xmath74 with best fit values @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "not surprisingly , the distribution of @xmath65 is very similar to the known distribution of @xmath7 ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 values for our halos has best fit values @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    to highlight a small difference between @xmath65 and @xmath7 ,",
    "displays the values of @xmath65 versus @xmath79 for our sample of simulated halos , and shows a weak correlation .",
    "given that @xmath7 is known to be uncorrelated with @xmath79 ( nfw ) , this correlation arises from @xmath71 in the above relation between the two spin parameters ( as demonstrated in the figure )   and the traditional spin parameter @xmath7 . ] .",
    "the error on the measurement of @xmath80 in the simulations is of primary importance for the interpretation of the results and , here , for the specific task of fitting a functional form to the angular - momentum profile . obtaining a precise measurement of @xmath80 in halos",
    "is difficult because the signal - to - noise is relatively small due to the fact that the local coherent velocity of the halo contributing to the angular momentum is small compared the velocity dispersion .",
    "the variable @xmath65 itself roughly characterizes the signal to noise ( per particle ) at any radius @xmath17 , , which is typically at the level of a few percent .    in order to obtain a crude estimate of the error , which is probably an upper limit",
    ", we singled out several large halos with @xmath81 simulated particles ( @xmath82 ) , and measured their angular momentum using a series of sparsely sampled realizations of @xmath0 particles down to @xmath83 of @xmath81 , with 100 random realizations for each value of @xmath0 . the average and standard deviation of the measured value @xmath22 relative to the original value obtained with all the particles , @xmath84 , as a function of @xmath0 ,",
    "are shown in for three halos with different values of @xmath65 .",
    "we find that for a subsample of @xmath0 particles the standard deviation @xmath85 scales like @xmath86 this scaling relation is shown as error bars in , and it fits rather well the measured scatter .",
    "the first term in corresponds to the general poisson sampling error and the second term reflects the noise due to velocity dispersion .",
    "the second term typically dominates because @xmath65 is small , and thus the spin parameter itself directly influences our ability to measure @xmath22 accurately , with the number of particles needed for a fixed accuracy scaling like @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "even @xmath89 accuracy requires @xmath90 .",
    "the above estimate of the error probably tends to overestimate the true error because it includes small - scale noise that is not present when a smaller number of particles is used in the actual dynamical simulation of the halo . on the other hand",
    ", our procedure above does not mimic the error made in following the true dynamics of the smooth halo when a smaller number of particles is used  an effect which tends to cause an underestimate of the error .",
    "an accurate evaluation of the error in @xmath22 requires a direct comparison of the same halo as simulated with different resolutions , and is clearly sensitive to the @xmath0-body code used . in our analysis here",
    "we limit ourself to the crude estimate , . in the appendix we use a simulation with @xmath27 times the mass resolution in order to check for systematic differences in the derived @xmath13 profiles , and find none .",
    "this analysis gives us confidence that mass resolution does not affect our results in any severe way .",
    "our goal is to determine how the angular momentum is distributed in the halo .",
    "we wish to compute the mass distribution of specific angular momentum , @xmath13 , and also the spatial distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "we first compute the total @xmath80 for each halo , and let it define the @xmath91 direction . then we subdivide the spherical volume of each halo into many spatial cells , each containing many particles , and compute the specific angular momentum in each cell , projected along the @xmath91 direction .",
    "in general we use the symbol @xmath2 to refer to this @xmath91-projected angular momentum . in some instances",
    "we also investigate the non - projected , absolute magnitude of angular momentum in each cell , which we refer to as @xmath92 .",
    "when comparisons between the two measurements are made , we explicitly add the subscript @xmath91 to the projected value , @xmath93 .",
    "the cell geometry and spatial distribution were designed to maximize the number of particles in each cell while at the same time sampling as much of the @xmath2 distribution as possible .",
    "the vector character of angular momentum naturally introduces a preferred axis , convolved with the general spherical symmetry of the mass distribution .",
    "the cells are defined using the usual spherical coordinates ( @xmath94,@xmath95,@xmath96 ) about the halo center .",
    "each of our cells spans the full @xmath97 range in @xmath96 , and they span the range of ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) from ( @xmath100 ) to ( @xmath101 ) . the radial shells are spaced such that each contains the same number of particles .",
    "the shells are then divided into three azimuthal cells of equal volume between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "positions with the same @xmath94 @xmath99 above and below the equatorial plane belong to the same cell .",
    "for all the @xmath13 profiles studied in detail and presented in the figures below , we adjusted the number of radial bins such that each cell contains roughly @xmath104 particles , where @xmath105 if @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "we construct @xmath13 profiles for each halo by ranking the cells by their @xmath2 values , and counting the cumulative mass in cells with angular momentum less than @xmath2 . because @xmath2 corresponds to a projected component",
    ", it is possible for a cell to have a negative value of @xmath2 .",
    "the anti - alignment needed for a cell to have a negative @xmath2 value is rare , but when one occurs , we remove the cell completely from the ranked list used to construct the @xmath13 profile . about @xmath109 of halos have a significant amount of their total mass ( @xmath110 ) contained in negative @xmath2 cells .",
    "we do not consider these anti - aligned halos in our @xmath13 analysis .",
    "we assign an error to the @xmath2 in each cell using .",
    "every halo analyzed has @xmath111 particles within its virial radius , corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    "we have @xmath113 halos that meet our requirements . in practice",
    ", we determined the shape of the functional form which fits @xmath13 by examining the group of ( @xmath114 ) halos with @xmath115 particles , for which the profiles are determined with greater accuracy .",
    "we extended the mass range down to @xmath116 particles in order to determine whether more typical galactic - sized halos have a similar profile .",
    "although these smaller halos have larger errors on their fit parameters , they seem to obey the same @xmath13 profile .",
    "the main limitation of this analysis is mass resolution . because we need @xmath117 particles per cell in order to obtain a reasonable measure of @xmath2 , our determination of @xmath13 is only reliable down to @xmath26 for @xmath108 and @xmath118 for @xmath106 .",
    "we find that the specific angular - momentum profiles of halos in the simulation are well - fit by the following two parameter function : @xmath119 the profile has an implicit maximum specific angular momentum @xmath120 .",
    "it is roughly a power - law for @xmath121 , and flattens out for @xmath122 .",
    "as can be seen by its relation to @xmath123 , the quantity @xmath5 ( @xmath124 ) acts as a shape parameter : for @xmath125 , @xmath13 is a pure power law , while @xmath126 means that only half the mass falls within the power - law regime and the bend is pronounced .",
    "the pair of parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 fully defines the angular momentum distribution of the halo .",
    "the global spin parameter is related to @xmath5 and @xmath6 via @xmath127 where @xmath128 once the value of @xmath65 is known , eq .  [ eq : fit ] is a one - parameter fitting function . in fitting the @xmath13 profiles for each halo , we first measured @xmath65 and then obtained the best fit @xmath13 with the constraint that @xmath5 and @xmath6 return the measured @xmath65 .",
    "the pair @xmath129 is perhaps the most useful pair of parameters for characterizing the halo angular momentum because @xmath65 is the conventional global measure and @xmath6 can be explicitly determined from @xmath65 and @xmath5 via , while @xmath5 can not be determined explicitly from the other two parameters without iteratively solving .",
    "alternatively , we provide the following approximation for the iterative solution of : ( b ) 1 + , which is accurate to within @xmath130 in @xmath131 over the range @xmath132 .",
    "figure  [ fig : examples ] shows @xmath13 examples for several of our halos . in the left panel",
    "we have normalized the profiles by @xmath133 and @xmath123 in order to illustrate how different values of @xmath5 affect the distribution . as @xmath5 approaches its minimum value of @xmath103",
    ", a larger fraction of the halo mass is spinning slowly compared to @xmath123 .",
    "larger values of @xmath5 imply a more uniform @xmath2 distribution .",

    "figure  [ fig : mu.vs.lambda ] shows the joint distribution of these two parameters for our simulated halos .",
    "we observe a weak but significant linear correlation between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , with a pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath144 ( corresponding to a probability @xmath145 for no correlation ) .",
    "thus , high - spin systems tend to have more evenly distributed ( power - law ) @xmath13 profiles than low - spin systems , but the scatter about this trend is large .",
    "does the angular - momentum distribution correlate with the mass - density distribution ?",
    "we know that the global spin characterized by @xmath146 does not correlate strongly with the halo mass ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) and correlates only weakly with the concentration parameter ( ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cm ] shows @xmath131 versus these mass parameters .",
    "we detect a marginal anti - correlation with mass , with @xmath147 ( @xmath148 for no correlation ) , and an even less significant anti - correlation with @xmath79 , of @xmath149 ( @xmath150 for no correlation ) .",
    "in the previous section we explored the distribution by mass of the specific angular momentum within each halo .",
    "this does not tell us much about how well the angular momentum is aligned throughout the halo or how angular momentum is distributed spatially .",
    "this section is explicitly devoted to these issues . in",
    "we address the question of alignment , in we investigate the cylindrical symmetry of the angular - momentum distribution , and in we explore the angular - momentum profile in spherical shells .      here",
    "we address the question of how well the smoothed angular momentum is aligned throughout the halo volume .    for our first alignment statistic",
    ", we divide the particles in each halo into an inner half - mass sphere and an outer half - mass shell and measure the cosine of the angle between inner and outer angular - momentum vectors , @xmath151 .",
    "the distribution of measured alignment values is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ahist ] .    before we attempt to interpret these results , it is essential to keep in mind the large errors involved in determining angular momentum direction vectors . even for a halo with an intrinsically well - aligned angular momentum distribution ( @xmath152 ) , measurement errors in each of the six directional components involved in the alignment cosine will tend to drive the measured value _ towards zero _ , and ,",
    "if large enough , will lead to a false measure of misalignment .",
    "the distribution in the top panel can therefore serve as a lower bound for the true alignment .    in order to obtain a conservative estimate of the distribution of true alignment cosines , we use to assign errors to each component of @xmath153 in both the inner and outer half - mass regions and perform a standard propagation of errors to obtain an estimate for the measurement error on @xmath151 .",
    "we add the estimated error in each case to the measured alignment value in order to obtain a `` corrected '' distribution for @xmath151 .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ahist ] . as argued above",
    ", we believe equation  [ eq : er ] is an overestimate for the measurement error , so our corrected alignment cosines represent a plausible upper limit for the alignment .",
    "the true intrinsic distribution probably lies somewhere between the corrected and uncorrected distributions .",
    "if we make this assumption , then the two distributions allow us to conclude that between @xmath154 and @xmath155 of the halos are aligned to a greater degree than @xmath156 , although there is also a tail of significantly misaligned halos .",
    "if the angular momentum within a halo is poorly aligned , one might expect a reflection of this to appear in its @xmath157 profile .",
    "there is a hint for such a trend in , where the distribution of @xmath151 for all the halos is compared to the distribution for low @xmath5 halos of @xmath158 .",
    "the latter clearly show a higher fraction of misaligned halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : avsmu ] shows the corrected @xmath151 values versus the shape parameter @xmath5 for each halo , and indeed there is a significant trend , with @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) .   and",
    "@xmath65 ; however , this seems to be due to the correlation between @xmath22 errors and the spin .",
    "the correlation is not apparent when we use our corrected estimate for @xmath151 . ]",
    "the misaligned halos tend to be associated with low-@xmath5 profiles  that is , profiles that deviate significantly from power laws , with a relatively larger amount of mass in the tails of their @xmath93 distributions .",
    "this result suggests that there are common aspects to the origin of misalignment and that of the non - powerlaw nature of the @xmath13 profiles .",
    "since halos with misaligned angular momentum distributions may be less likely to host large disk galaxies , this result should be kept in mind when modeling galaxy formation within halos with low-@xmath5 angular momentum profiles .",
    "addresses the angular - momentum alignment in halos in another way , independent of any specific spatial symmetry .",
    "here we show the @xmath13 profiles for four different halos , comparing the distributions of both @xmath93 and @xmath92 in cells throughout the halo volume .",
    "we see that in most cases , the two kinds of profiles are similar ; for at least half the mass they differ by less than a factor of two .",
    "this indicates that the angular momentum is reasonably well aligned throughout the halo .",
    "the slight misalignment is expressed in a trend that the @xmath92 distributions systematically resemble a power - law more than the @xmath93 distributions .",
    "this is demonstrated in , which shows the values of @xmath131 obtained using @xmath92 versus those obtained using @xmath93 .",
    "the correlation is obvious , with @xmath161 .",
    "the value of @xmath131 is typically about a factor of 3 higher for the @xmath92 profiles .",
    "the fact that this factor is somewhat higher for low values of @xmath5 , reflects the correlation seen in between alignment and @xmath5 .",

    ", we have again divided the halos into cells , as described in , except that we no longer explicitly impose symmetry about the equatorial plane and rotational symmetry in @xmath96 .",
    "specifically , we define the cells as outlined in , but then , for each value of @xmath162 , we further divide the cell particles into four regions : above and below the equatorial plane , and split by rotation angle @xmath163 and @xmath164 . because each cell now contains roughly one fourth of the particles , we increased our minimum halo mass threshold by a factor of four to @xmath165 , only for this section of our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] shows a map of the @xmath2 distribution in cells in four of our halos . except for the halo depicted in the lower - left panel , the symmetry of the angular - momentum distribution tends to be more cylindrical than spherical , with a weak dependence on @xmath95 at a constant distance from the global spin axis , @xmath162 . on the other hand",
    ", the angular momentum of the halo in the lower - left panel tends to be concentrated in the @xmath32 plane .    another way of visualizing the degree of cylindrical symmetry of halos is shown in figure  [ fig : cyl ] .",

    "the different symbol types should be well - mixed if a halo is cylindrically symmetric .",
    "this is the case for three out of the four halos shown , except in the lower - left panel , as expected from figure  [ fig : map ] .    although the angular momentum distributions in most of the halos tend to qualitatively show a certain degree of cylindrical symmetry , there is some indication that , for fixed @xmath162 , mass near the equatorial plane tends to have more specific angular momentum than corresponding mass in the poles . in order to quantify the extent to which this is true",

    "figure  [ fig : jrathist ] shows the histogram of this ratio for all of our halos .",
    "the mean is @xmath173 , and the standard deviation is @xmath174 .    in order to test whether our specific choice of cell geometry would bias this measure",

    "the resulting @xmath168 histogram for the artificial catalog is shown by the shaded historgram in figure  [ fig : jrathist ] .",
    "the sharp peak near a ratio of @xmath103 indicates that the bias due to our cell geometry is much smaller than the detected deviation from cylindrical symmetry .",

    "although , as demonstrated in , the specific angular momentum distribution in halos is closer to being cylindrically symmetric than spherically symmetric , an exploration of how @xmath2 , averaged over shells , behaves as a function of radius is of particular interest because this is the profile that is most directly addressed by theory ( see below ) .",
    "barnes & efstathiou ( 1987 ) found in their early work an indication for a rough @xmath176 behavior .",
    "for our sample of well - resolved halos , we indeed find that a power - law : @xmath177 , with @xmath178 roughly distributed over the halos like a gaussian : @xmath179 is a good approximation .    in order to connect more closely to the mass distribution profiles discussed in previous sections , and also to allow a more direct connection with theory , we focus on characterizing the spherical profile as a function of the mass contained within the radius @xmath94 , @xmath180 .",
    "we find that the power - law approximation describes the profiles reasonably well , j(m ) m^s  , with @xmath181 roughly distributed over the halos like a gaussian : @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sphere ] shows three examples of the spherical @xmath182 profiles along with their best - fit power - laws .",
    "notice that although the power - laws serve as a good general characterization of the @xmath2 behavior with @xmath10 , the profiles do not always follow a power - law form in detail .",
    "in many cases , the profiles show an upwards bend in the outer shells , reminiscent of the characteristic bend in the low-@xmath5 mass distribution , @xmath13 .",
    "in some cases , @xmath2 is not always monotonic with @xmath10 .",
    "so , although the @xmath181 values provide a useful characteristic of the spherical distribution of @xmath2 , some information is lost under this approximation .",
    "shown in is the distribution of @xmath181 values , versus halo mass . despite the large scatter , there is an anti - correlation between slope and mass , with @xmath183 , ( @xmath184 ) . as we will discuss in , a simple calculation based on linear tidal - torque theory provides a hint at understanding the typical slope value @xmath185 , and predicts a mild anti - correlation between @xmath181 and the halo mass , in agreement with the simulations .",
    "the spherical profile @xmath182 and the mass distribution @xmath13 are expected to be related . if the mass distribution is spherically symmetric and the angular - momentum distribution is cylindrically symmetric , this relation can be spelled out explicitly . in this case",
    "the inverse of @xmath13 is the spatial profile @xmath186 in growing cylinders about the total spin axis .",
    "a power law with a bend for @xmath13 translates to a corresponding power law with a weaker bend in the opposite direction for @xmath182 .",

    "an anti - correlation is evident , as expected , with @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the scatter reflects deviations from the global spatial symmetries .",
    "it is likely , for example , that partial misalignment and pockets of low - angular momentum material at large radii contribute to the scatter . by comparing figures [ fig : s.vs.m ] and [ fig : cm ] it is evident that the scatter in the @xmath181-@xmath5 relation is large enough to wash away any mass dependence of @xmath5 that would be implied by the weak mass dependence of @xmath181 .",
    "in this section we explore the possible origin of the angular momentum profile based on two different pictures for how specific angular momentum is acquired in halos . in the first picture ,",
    "angular momentum is built up shell by shell , and is modeled using linear theory with no further angular momentum transfer within the halo . in the second picture ,",
    "the angular momentum profile arises solely from angular momentum transfer from one or more satellite halo merger events .",
    "since halo mass accretion histories typically reflect some combination of relatively quiescent mass accretion as well as more pronounced mergers ( where @xmath2 transfer is likely ) , the @xmath2 profiles of individual halos may reflect a complicated combination of the two processes explored here .",
    "indeed the two processes are intrinsically linked , since , in the hierarchical framework , all mass accretion can be treated as the accretion of smaller objects . as shown below",
    ", the profiles calculated from linear theory as well as those calculated using @xmath2 transfer from mergers produce a range of @xmath5 values , in qualitative agreement with what is observed in the simulations .",
    "linear tidal - torque theory ( ttt ) provides a hint for the origin of the detected power - law - like @xmath2 profile , as follows .",
    "ttt ( doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) implies that the angular momentum gained by a halo at time @xmath189 before its turn - around is j_i(t ) = a(t)^2",
    "d(t ) _ ijk t_jl",
    "i_lk  , [ eq : ttt ] where the time growth is from some fiducial initial time , @xmath190 is the expansion factor at @xmath189 , @xmath191 is the linear growth factor , @xmath192 is the inertia tensor of the proto - halo at the initial time and @xmath193 is the tidal tensor at the halo center at the initial time , smoothed on the halo scale .",
    "this is based on assuming the zeldovich approximation for the velocities inside the proto - halo , and a 2@xmath194-order taylor expansion of the potential .",
    "we show elsewhere ( porciani , dekel & hoffman 2000 ) that the standard scaling relation of ttt should be slightly modified ; it should read j d(t_c)^3/2 ( m ) m^2/3 , [ eq : scaling ] where @xmath2 is the specific angular momentum of the halo , @xmath195 is the turn - around time of the halo , and @xmath196 is the rms density fluctuation on scale @xmath10 at the initial time . if the perturbation turned around while the cosmology was still einstein - de sitter , then @xmath197 .",
    "dependence on the time of collapse is @xmath198 rather than @xmath199 , because the tidal part of the deformation tensor , the source of angular momentum , is actually independent of the initial density of the perturbation , which determines the collapse time .",
    "the shear depends instead on the rms fluctuation @xmath200 , which involves an implicit mass dependence . ]    to understand the general power - law behavior of the angular - momentum profile we apply .",
    "we can assume that mass is accreted in shells and that the turn - around time of each shell is determined by @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the mean density inside @xmath10 .",
    "for a gaussian field , the typical density fluctuation profile about a random point scales like ( dekel 1981 ) @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the linear two - point correlation function .",
    "this is accurate to a few percent also around a high peak ( bardeen et al .",
    "1996 , fig . 8) .",
    "thus , for a power - law power spectrum @xmath205 and a flat universe , we obtain the following spin profile within each halo : j(m ) m^2/3 + ( 3+n)/3  .",
    "this implies @xmath206 for @xmath207 , the range appropriate for @xmath208 halos in a cdm spectrum , in pleasant agreement with our finding for the simulated halos ( ) .",
    "the tidal torque theory can be combined with the extended press - schechter formalism ( eps , bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) to obtain a more detailed model of @xmath2-distribution , as well as quantitative predictions for values of @xmath181 and @xmath5 and their mass dependence .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that halo mass is acquired via accretion of material with specific angular momentum given by equation  [ eq : scaling ] and that the direction of angular momentum of each mass shell is perfectly aligned .",
    "we can readily estimate the slope @xmath181 of the @xmath209 distribution if we assume that the turn - around time for each mass shell is approximated by the time at which the mass was first accreted onto the halo by comparing the expected @xmath2 value at any two shells encompassing masses @xmath210 and @xmath211 , s  .",
    "[ eq : slope ] equation  [ eq : scaling ] provides the required value of @xmath2 associated with each mass shell given its `` accretion time '' , @xmath212 .",

    "we adopted for all halos , by the requirement of virialization , @xmath216 ( the current age of the universe ) , and set @xmath217 .",
    "the most probable value of @xmath218 can be estimated via eps ( lacey & cole 1993 , eq .",
    "the predicted @xmath219 relation is added to as the thick solid line .",
    "the agreement with the mean trend shown by the simulated halos is remarkable , especially since our model has no free parameters .",
    "we can further elaborate the model by following the more detailed mass accretion history of halos using eps merger trees . specifically , we have used the method of somerville & kolatt ( 1999 ) to model mass growth and halo accretion histories for a random ensemble of dark matter halos formed in the @xmath1cdm model and with masses in the mass range studied in the simulation . at each epoch , @xmath220 , and time interval , @xmath221 , the model draws a mass @xmath222 accreted by a halo of mass @xmath223 using the eps probability distribution .",
    "if we assume that this mass is accreted with specific angular momentum given by and that there is no angular momentum loss , we can integrate the specific halo mass accretion history to get the @xmath13 distribution for the final halo at @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : models ] shows @xmath13 profiles calculated using this model along with the fits of the form @xmath224 , , for three representative mass accretion histories from the ensemble of realizations .",
    "one can see that the model reproduces the general shape of the @xmath13 profile with values of @xmath5 that are similar to those of simulated halos .    for a given halo mass ,",
    "the differences in merger histories lead to scatter in the resulting values of @xmath5 , with the range of @xmath225 .",
    "the absence of small @xmath5 ( @xmath226 ) may result from our simplified model assumption of perfect alignment .",
    "indeed , the range of these modeled @xmath5 values is similar to the range obtained for our simulated halos when @xmath92 profiles are considered instead of @xmath93 ( see ) .",
    "we can also reproduce both the range of values and the trend with mass of the slope @xmath181 if we force a power - law fit to the model @xmath182 profiles .",
    "the halos with low ( high ) @xmath5 in this model are those that accrete large fractions of their mass at early ( late ) epochs .",

    "as expected , the central concentration of the disk is a decreasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "as anticipated , compared to the exponential disk ( and solid body rotator ) the derived disk profiles have core and tail excesses .",
    "only halos with the highest @xmath5 values ( @xmath263 , corresponding to @xmath264 of the halos ) produce surface density profiles that begin to resemble an exponential disk .    in comparison with the observed light profiles of disks ,",
    "the derived gas surface density profiles deviate in their general shape and in particular in their central concentration .",
    "the general deviation of shape is less worrisome because the final stellar profile may not necessarily mirror the gas profile .",
    "as lin & pringle ( 1987 ) and olivier et al .",
    "( 1991 ) argued , viscous transport processes can act to produce exponential stellar disks under rather general assumptions about the nature of the initial gas disk .",
    "however , since typical viscous processes would tend to amplify the central density even further , the indicated central density excess is of some concern .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the more severe problem of excessively small disk sizes seen in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 1997 , 2000 ) . that we find a disk central - density excess even under the assumption that angular momentum is conserved during the collapse indicates that the solution to the problem may not be trivial , because any simple angular - momentum transport mechanism would drive the angular - momentum from the gas to the halo and from the inside out and could only worsen the discrepancy .",
    "the solution may require that the baryons somehow obtain an angular momentum distribution that is biased relative to that of the dark matter towards high-@xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , if the resultant profiles are interpreted to represent both a bulge and a disk component , with the slowly rotating core associated with the bulge , then the central concentration problem may be resolved .",
    "testing this hypothesis will require more detailed modeling .",
    "in particular , it will be necessary to match the observed distribution of galaxy bulge - to - disk ratios as well as disk scale lengths .",
    "another way out may be associated with the fact that some of the approximations adopted here may break down when the @xmath2 distribution is significantly misaligned throughout the halo , which indeed preferentially happens for low-@xmath5 halos ( ) .",
    "we have studied the angular momentum structure within dark - matter halos in the mass range @xmath40 , using a sample of @xmath113 halos in an n - body simulation of the @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "we examined in detail the more massive of these halos , for which the angular momentum is measured more accurately , and then verified that the more typical galaxy - sized halos have a similar angular momentum distribution .",
    "our primary result is that the mass distribution of specific angular momentum in halos obeys a roughly universal form , which is well fit by the two - parameter function @xmath265 . for a fixed value of the spin parameter @xmath65",
    ", the parameter @xmath5 determines the shape of the distribution , with high-@xmath5 corresponding to a pure power - law and a smaller contrast between the tails of the distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath266 is roughly log normal , with the @xmath155 range spanning @xmath267 . compared to an idealized uniform sphere in solid - body rotation , the simulated halos tend to have more of their mass in the tails of the distribution , especially at small @xmath2 .",
    "the shape parameter is only weakly correlated with the spin parameter , @xmath268 with @xmath269 and a correlation coefficient @xmath270 .",
    "most halos have well - aligned angular momentum vectors throughout their volume .",
    "between 70% and 90% have alignment cosines greater than @xmath271 between the inner and outer half masses .",
    "however , at least 10% of the halos have significant misalignments , which may be interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , they tend also to be halos with low @xmath5 , indicating that the direction of * j * in accreted material , or the halo merger history , plays a role in determining the shape of the @xmath13 profile . in addition , it is unlikely that the standard simple picture of disk formation could be valid within a severely misaligned halo , so perhaps these objects typically host spheroidal stellar components .",
    "marginally misaligned halos may play a role in the formation of galactic warps ( e.g. , dekel & schlosman 1983 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of halo angular momentum tends to be more cylindrically symmetric than spherically symmetric . at a fixed distance from the rotation axis , mass near the equatorial plane",
    "typically has only about @xmath272 more specific angular momentum than corresponding mass near the poles .",
    "the mean @xmath2 is spherical shells encompassing mass @xmath10 is well - fit by a power law , @xmath273 .",
    "the power @xmath181 is distributed like a gaussian with a mean of @xmath274 and standard deviation @xmath275 .",
    "we pointed out two possible explanations for the origin of the universal angular - momentum profile .",
    "the first is based on applying a corrected version of the linear tidal - torque theory ( porciani & dekel 2000 ) to extended press - schechter mass accretion histories .",
    "the second is based on the nonlinear process of angular momentum transfer from satellite orbits in halo mergers ( see also dekel & burkert 2000 ) .",
    "since halo mass growth arises as a combination of merger events and relatively quiescent mass accretion , the origin of the profile in individual halos may reflect some combination of the two processes .",
    "each of these processes seems to produce @xmath2 profiles that are similar in form to those observed in simulated halos , and thus may provide a starting point for a deeper understanding of the origin of halo angular - momentum structure .",
    "finally , we have started to explore the implications of our universal @xmath13 distribution in the context of the archetypical model of galactic disk formation , namely , adiabatic baryonic infall to a rotationally supported disk while conserving angular momentum in every mass element .",
    "we find that the implied surface - density profiles , which vary as a function of both @xmath5 and @xmath65 , deviate significantly from an exponential disk for all but the largest values of @xmath5 .",
    "the resultant surface profiles are more extended than exponential at large @xmath94 , and are overly concentrated at small @xmath94 .",
    "since the observed light profiles of disks are closer to exponential , our result indicates that the disk formation process can not be fully understood within this simplified picture .",
    "we mentioned that the general deviation from an exponential surface density at moderate radii might be overcome in this picture if a viscous transport mechanism is included ( lin & pringle 1987 ) .",
    "as shown by olivier et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , such a mechanism tends to produce exponential stellar distributions regardless of the initial gas profile .",
    "however , most of the expected @xmath2 transport typically acts to increase the central mass density , so the deviation at small radii may be a significant problem . even though we have assumed that the baryons experience no angular - momentum loss , we ended up with an `` angular momentum problem '' similar to that detected in hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 1997 , 2000 , where it is associated with @xmath2 transport from the gas to the dark matter and from inside out ) .",
    "this problem is most severe for halos with small @xmath5 , so the tendency for these halos to have misaligned angular - momentum distributions , which makes them less - likely hosts of large disk galaxies , may partly ease the problem in the limiting case where angular - momentum is conserved .",
    "however , even if we focus on halos that tend to be well aligned , with @xmath276 , the central densities remain higher than those in exponential disks .",
    "a solution to this problem may be to associate the derived central mass concentrations with bulges .",
    "it is indeed possible that the central regions of disks with profiles as in are unstable to self gravity .",
    "more detailed modeling is needed for testing the viability of this solution .",
    "in particular , one may be worried about the model over - predicting bulge to disk ratios and in particular under - predicting the number of bulge - less galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "such an interpretation may shed new light on the very origin of the hubble sequence , since both @xmath5 and @xmath65 may play a role in determining disk scale lengths , surface brightnesses , and bulge fractions .",

    "the test utilizes the output from another @xmath1cdm simulation with identical cosmological parameters and the same number of particles as used in our main simulation , but now in a box of side @xmath277 , namely half the original size .",
    "the mass resolution is thus @xmath27 times higher , so a statistical comparison with halos analyzed from our lower resolution simulation at fixed mass will provide a useful test for the effects of mass resolution .",

    "<S> the spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be cylindrical and is well - aligned within each halo for @xmath9 of the halos . </S>",
    "<S> the more misaligned halos tend to have low-@xmath5 values . when averaged over spherical shells encompassing mass @xmath10 , the halo @xmath2 profiles are fit by @xmath11 with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate two ideas for the origin of this profile . </S>",
    "<S> the first is based on a revised version of linear tidal - torque theory combined with extended press - schechter mass accretion , and the second focuses on @xmath2 transport in minor mergers .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly explore implications of the @xmath13 profile on the formation of galactic disks assuming that @xmath2 is conserved during an adiabatic baryonic infall . </S>",
    "<S> the implied gas density profile deviates from an exponential disk , with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii . </S>",
    "<S> the steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that are smaller than observed . </S>",
    "<S> this is reminiscent of the  angular - momentum problem \" seen in hydrodynamic simulations , even though we have assumed perfect @xmath2 conservation . </S>",
    "<S> a possible solution is to associate the central excesses with bulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks . </S>"
