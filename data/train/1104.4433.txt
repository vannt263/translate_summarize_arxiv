    "algorithms on sequences of symbols have been studied for a long time and now form a fundamental part of computer science .",
    "one of the very important problems in analysis of sequences is the longest common subsequence ( lcs ) problem .",
    "the computational problem of finding the longest common subsequence of a set of @xmath5 strings has been studied extensively over the last thirty years ( see @xcite and references ) .",
    "this problem has many applications . when @xmath6 , the longest common subsequence is a measure of the similarity of two strings and is thus useful in molecular biology , pattern recognition , and text compression @xcite .",
    "the version of lcs in which the number of strings is unrestricted is also useful in text compression @xcite , and is a special case of the multiple sequence alignment and consensus subsequence discovery problem in molecular biology @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-unrestricted lcs problem is * np*-complete @xcite .",
    "if the number of sequences is fixed at @xmath5 with maximum length @xmath7 , their longest common subsequence can be found in @xmath8 time , through an extension of the pairwise algorithm @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the longest common subsequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be found in time @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "sequence - level investigation has become essential in modern molecular biology . but to consider genetic molecules only as long sequences consisting of the 4 basic constituents is too simple to determine the function and physical structure of the molecules .",
    "additional information about the sequences should be added to the sequences .",
    "early works with these additional information are primary structure based , the sequence comparison is basically done on the primary structure while trying to incorporate secondary structure data @xcite .",
    "this approach has the weakness that it does not treat a base pair as a whole entity .",
    "recently , an improved model was proposed @xcite .",
    "arc - annotated sequences are useful in describing the secondary and tertiary structures of rna and protein sequences .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion and references .",
    "structure comparison for rna and for protein sequences has become a central computational problem bearing many challenging computer science questions . in this context ,",
    "the longest arc preserving common subsequence problem ( lapcs ) recently has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "it is a sound and meaningful mathematical formalization of comparing the secondary structures of molecular sequences .",
    "studies for this problem have been undertaken in @xcite .",
    "given two sequences @xmath14 and @xmath15 over some fixed alphabet @xmath2 , the sequence @xmath15 is a subsequence of @xmath14 if @xmath15 can be obtained from @xmath14 by deleting some letters from @xmath14 .",
    "notice that the order of the remaining letters of @xmath14 bases must be preserved .",
    "the length of a sequence @xmath14 is the number of letters in it and is denoted as @xmath16 . for simplicity , we use @xmath17 $ ] to denote the @xmath18th letter in sequence @xmath14 , and @xmath19 $ ] to denote the substring of @xmath14 consisting of the @xmath18th letter through the @xmath20th letter",
    ".    given two sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( over some fixed alphabet @xmath2 ) , the classic longest common subsequence problem asks for a longest sequence @xmath15 that is a subsequence of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "an arc - annotated sequence of length @xmath7 on a finite alphabet @xmath2 is a couple @xmath21 where @xmath14 is a sequence of length @xmath7 on @xmath2 and @xmath22 is a set of pairs @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . in this paper",
    "we will then call an element of @xmath14 a base .",
    "a pair @xmath25 represents an arc linking bases @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] of @xmath14 .",
    "the bases @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] are said to belong to the arc @xmath23 and are the only bases that belong to this arc .",
    "given two annotated sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 with arc sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , a common subsequence @xmath15 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 induces a bijective mapping from a subset of @xmath30 to subset of @xmath31 . the common subsequence @xmath15 is arc - preserving if the arcs induced by the mapping are preserved , i.e. , for any @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the mapping , @xmath34    the lapcs problem is to find a longest common subsequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 that is arc - preserving ( with respect to the given arc sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) @xcite .",

    "question : find a longest common subsequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 that is arc - preserving .    the arc structure can be restricted .",
    "we consider the following four natural restrictions on an arc set @xmath22 which are first discussed in @xcite :    \\1 .",
    "no sharing of endpoints : + @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "no crossing : + @xmath38 \\leftrightarrow i_2 \\in [ i_3,i_4]$ ] .",
    "no nesting : + @xmath39 .    \\4 .",
    "no arcs : + @xmath40 .",
    "these restrictions are used progressively and inclusively to produce five distinct levels of permitted arc structures for lapcs :     unlimited  no restrictions ;     crossing  restriction 1 ;     nested  restrictions 1 and 2 ;     chain  restrictions 1 , 2 and 3 ;     plain  restriction 4 .",
    "the problem lapcs is varied by these different levels of restrictions as lapcs@xmath41 which is problem lapcs with @xmath11 having restriction level @xmath42 and @xmath12 having restriction level @xmath43 . without loss of generality , we always assume that @xmath42 is the same level or higher than @xmath43 .",
    "we give the definitions of two special cases of the lapcs problem , which were first studied in @xcite .",
    "the special cases are motivated from biological applications @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44-fragment lapcs problem @xmath45 :    instance : an alphabet @xmath2 , annotated sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath35 , with arc sets @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are divided into fragments of lengths exactly @xmath44 ( the last fragment can have a length less than @xmath44 ) .",
    "question : find a longest common subsequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 that is arc - preserving .",
    "the allowed matches are those between fragments at the same location .",
    "the @xmath44-diagonal lapcs problem , @xmath46 , is an extension of the @xmath44-fragment lapcs problem , where base @xmath47 $ ] is allowed only to match bases in the range @xmath48 $ ] .    the @xmath44-diagonal lapcs and @xmath44-fragment lapcs problems are relevant in the comparison of conserved rna sequences where we already have a rough idea about the correspondence between bases in the two sequences .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the @xmath0-fragment lapcs(crossing , crossing ) and @xmath1-diagonal lapcs(crossing , crossing ) are solvable in time @xmath49 .",
