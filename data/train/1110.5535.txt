    "the large hadron collider beauty ( lhcb ) experiment  @xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a single arm , forward facing spectrometer designed to study heavy flavour physics .",
    "the detector covers the pseudorapidity region @xmath7 in which the @xmath8 collisions are currently at the energy of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 production cross section is @xmath11  @xcite in the acceptance , with the collisions producing a full spectrum of @xmath0-hadrons ( e.g. @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "+ the study of @xmath15 modes at lhcb relies heavily on the specific hardware and software components of the trigger , vertex locator ( velo ) and ring imaging chernkov ( rich ) subdetectors  @xcite .",
    "+ due to the large total cross section of the @xmath16 collisions , an efficient trigger is required in order to reduce the background .",
    "the lhcb trigger comprises of a level 0 ( l0 ) hardware trigger , followed by a software based higher level trigger ( hlt ) which fulfil this criterion .",
    "+ the alignment and resolution of the velo means it has an excellent ability to reconstruct tracks accurately which is important for proper time resolution measurements etc .",
    "there are two rich sub - detectors that are part of the lhcb , combined these cover the momentum range @xmath17 .",
    "it is these which give excellent particle identification ( pid ) used to separate hadronic final states ( e.g @xmath18 ) .",
    "+ presented here are measurements of the @xmath19 and @xmath6 cp asymmetries ( section  [ subsec : acp ] ) and effective lifetime of @xmath20 ( section  [ subsec : lifetime_top ] ) performed using integrated luminosities of @xmath21 ( 2011 data ) and @xmath22 ( full 2010 data ) respectively .",
    "the family of @xmath23 modes , where the discussion here will focus primarily on @xmath24 or @xmath25 decaying to a final state @xmath26 or @xmath27 , are of particular interest when studying charge parity ( cp ) violation in neutral @xmath0 meson mixing or in their decay .",
    "these decay modes are dominated by loop processes with a small contribution from tree processes .",
    "the former are sensitive to beyond the standard model ( bsm ) effects influencing the decay processes .",
    "the presence of these bsm effects can be observed by measuring quantities associated with decay modes which follow these paths , such as @xmath28 .",
    "these can be used to determine if there are any deviations between the observed quantities and standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "asymmetry measurements of flavour specific final states can also be measured in order to observe any deviations from the cp violation predicted by the sm .",
    "the time - integrated cp asymmetry , @xmath29 , is defined as    @xmath30    for a given final state @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to comparing the value to sm predictions , the measurement of @xmath29 for @xmath19 and @xmath6 is also an approximate test of u - spin symmetry where the @xmath32 ( see equation  [ eq : uspin ] ) quarks interchange .",
    "@xmath33    the asymmetry measurements of the flavour specific , time integrated modes ; @xmath19 and @xmath6 discussed here use @xmath34 of data collected in 2011  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are updated from a previous analysis using data collected in 2010  @xcite .",
    "there are many overlapping @xmath15 final states that are kinematically very similar .",
    "the use of rich pid information is imperative to discriminate between these specific backgrounds , such as @xmath35 and @xmath28 .    for a final state @xmath31 , the physical asymmetry @xmath29 is related to the raw asymmetry @xmath36 by    @xmath37    the raw asymmetry between the untagged final states of @xmath38 ( figure  [ fig : bd2kpirawasymmetry ] ) and @xmath39 ( figure  [ fig : bs2kpirawasymmetry ] ) can be observed by extracting the time integrated signal yields before applying the following corrections .     and @xmath40  @xcite . the event selection is tuned to maximise the sensitivity to @xmath29 for @xmath38 events.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]     and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the event selection is tuned to maximise the sensitivity to @xmath29 for @xmath39 events.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the two corrections which need to be applied to extract the physical asymmetry are :    * @xmath42 : detector - induced @xmath43 charge asymmetries * @xmath44 : b production asymmetry    the detector - induced asymmetry , @xmath42 , is determined by using untagged @xmath45 and self - tagged @xmath46 decays in high statistics charm samples .",
    "the slow pion , @xmath47 , allows for the tagging of the @xmath48 . from these , the raw asymmetries of @xmath45 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "final states can be measured .",
    "this is done by employing the current world average for the @xmath52 asymmetries for the two modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with the @xmath52 asymmetry for the cabibbo - favoured @xmath55 assumed to be negligible .",
    "this reduces the number of unknown observables to four : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . considering the equations in  [ eq : detasym ] ,",
    "these can then be solved , to acquire the relevant detector asymmetry , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath60    as the lhc is a p - p collider , and the initial state is not @xmath52-symmetric , it is possible that the production of @xmath61 and @xmath62 mesons will occur at different rates within the acceptance of the detector .",
    "an estimate of this production asymmetry is determined by using the self - tagged mode @xmath63 , where the flavour of the @xmath0 meson is tagged via the @xmath64 final states such that @xmath65 or @xmath66  @xcite . as a result of the additional corrections ,",
    "the physical asymmetries become    @xmath67    which are consistent with results from the data collected in 2010  @xcite .      the @xmath13 decay to @xmath68",
    "is a cp even final state accessible from both mass eigenstates ; @xmath69 ( light ) and @xmath70 ( heavy ) . in the absence of @xmath52 violation",
    "it would only be accessible from the @xmath69 state , however the sm predicts a very small amount of cp violation which allows a contribution from @xmath70 .",
    "a larger than expected contribution to the decay from @xmath70 would be an indication of cp violation beyond what is expected from the sm .",
    "the lifetime distribution is a function of two exponential functions where the corresponding untagged rate can be written as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is defined as :    @xmath73 with the predicted value by the sm of @xmath74  @xcite    the dominant experimental challenge associated with measuring the lifetime of this decay , is due to the introduction of a lifetime bias in the selection of these events . in order to account for this effect",
    ", two independent methods were used  @xcite ; a relative and an absolute lifetime measurement .",
    "these methods were both optimised for the full 2010 data set of @xmath75 .",
    "the details of each will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "the relative lifetime method for measuring the @xmath20 lifetime uses the assumption that the lifetime acceptance introduced via the event selection , can be cancelled by using a kinematically similar channel as the acceptances are expected to be similar .",
    "the channel chosen is the relatively abundant and similar @xmath19 .",
    "the sample of @xmath0 meson candidates obtained from the event selection is split into thirty proper - time bins split between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with the binning chosen such that each bin is expected to contain approximately the same number of b meson candidates .",
    "+ the @xmath20 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 mass distributions are all described by gaussian functions with first order polynomials used for the background .",
    "the parameters of the signal and background pdfs are fixed to the results of the time - integrated mass fits before the lifetime fit is performed . the @xmath78 yield ( @xmath80 )",
    "is constrained to follow equation  [ eq : releq ] , where @xmath81 is the mean proper time in the @xmath82 bin .",
    "a simultaneous fit is then performed to the @xmath68 and @xmath83 invariant mass spectra over all bins .",
    "the difference in reciprocal lifetimes , @xmath84 ( equation  [ eq : deltakk ] ) , is extracted directly from the fit .",

    "the absolute lifetime measurement measures the @xmath28 lifetime value directly using a novel approach to determine the acceptance effect  @xcite that is introduced via the event selection .",
    "the acceptance correction is calculated by taking selected events and moving the primary vertices ( pv ) of each event along the flight direction of the @xmath0 meson , which is determined by its momentum vector .",
    "the trigger and event selection criteria are then rerun , all lifetime dependent parameters are re - evaluated for the new position , and a lifetime interval in which the event would be accepted is determined . in the case of the absolute lifetime measurement , only the event selection is rerun as this selection was made tighter than the trigger cuts .",
    "the event by event acceptance intervals are then used as parameters in the fit .",

    "the measurement is factorised into two components .",
    "+ the first is a fit to determine a signal and background probability per event , this is applied to the observed invariant mass spectrum . to reduce the impact of partially reconstructed background and @xmath90 decays interfering with the mass spectrum fit , the mass range",

    "the signal is fitted using a standard gaussian distribution with a linear distribution used to describe the combinatoric background .",
    "+ the resultant signal and background probabilities are used in the second fit , which is performed to extract the lifetime .",
    "the lifetime pdf of the combinatorial background is estimated from data by using a non - parametric method and is modelled by a sum of kernel functions  @xcite .",
