    "heavy quarks are effective probes of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , since they are produced on a short time scale with respect to that of the qgp .",
    "they traverse the strongly interacting medium and lose energy through radiative  @xcite and collisional  @xcite processes .",
    "theoretical calculations predict a dependence of the energy loss on the colour charge and on the mass of the parton traversing the medium , resulting in a hierarchy in the energy loss with beauty quarks losing less energy than charm quarks , and charm quarks losing less energy than light quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss is experimentally investigated via the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 , defined as the ratio of the yield in nucleus - nucleus collisions to that observed in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . in the absence of medium effects , @xmath2 is expected to be unity for heavy flavours , since the production yields are proportional to the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the expected hierarchy in the energy loss described above can be verified comparing the @xmath2 of different particle species , namely @xmath3 . for this comparison",
    "it should be considered that the @xmath2 of the different hadronic species are also affected by the different production kinematics and fragmentation function of gluons , light and heavy quarks .",
    "the @xmath2 can be modified also due to initial - state effects , since the nuclear environment affects the quark and gluon distributions as described either by calculations based on phenomenological modifications of the parton distribution functions ( pdf )  @xcite or by the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory  @xcite .",
    "partons can also lose energy in the initial stages of the collision via initial - state radiation  @xcite , or they can experience transverse momentum broadening due to multiple soft collisions prior to the hard scattering  @xcite .",
    "initial - state effects are addressed by studying p ",
    "pb collisions .",
    "finally , in nucleus - nucleus collisions the charmed hadron azimuthal anisotropy , quantified via the second order coefficient of the fourier decomposition of the particle momentum azimuthal distribution ( @xmath4 ) , tests whether also charm quarks participate in the collective expansion dynamics and possibly thermalize in the qgp .",
    "the excellent performance of the alice detector  @xcite allows open heavy - flavour measurements in several decay channels and in a wide rapidity range . at mid - rapidity ( @xmath5 )",
    "d mesons are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and their charge conjugates .",
    "d - meson selection is based on the reconstruction of decay vertices displaced by a few hundred @xmath10 m from the interaction vertex , exploiting the high track - position resolution close to the interaction vertex provided by the inner tracking system ( its ) .",
    "the large combinatorial background is reduced by selections applied on the decay topology and by the identification of charged kaons and pions in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and time - of - flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "electrons are identified at mid - rapidity through their specific energy loss in the tpc gas combined with the information from the tof and from the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) . at forward rapidity",
    ", open heavy - flavour production is studied in the semi - muonic decay channel .",
    "muons are reconstructed in the five tracking stations of the muon spectrometer ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the reconstructed tracks are matched with tracklets measured in the trigger stations to reject punch - through hadrons .",

    "the measurement of d - meson @xmath12 is reported in  @xcite .     of heavy - flavour decay electrons at mid - rapidity and heavy - flavour decay muons at forward ( p - going direction ) and backward ( pb - going direction ) rapidities in minimum - bias p  pb collisions , as a function of @xmath14.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   of heavy - flavour decay electrons at mid - rapidity and heavy - flavour decay muons at forward ( p - going direction ) and backward ( pb - going direction ) rapidities in minimum - bias p  pb collisions , as a function of @xmath14.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the results are compatible with unity within uncertainties without any significant dependence on the rapidity interval investigated .",
    "the measurements confirm that initial - state effects due to the presence of cold - nuclear matter are small in the measured @xmath14 range .",
    "theoretical predictions based on pqcd calculations including the eps09  @xcite nuclear modification of the pdf can describe the measurements .",
    "the d - meson @xmath12 is also compatible with calculations based on the cgc  @xcite and with a model including cold - nuclear - matter energy loss , nuclear shadowing and @xmath15-broadening  @xcite .",

    "pb collisions with respect to the binary - scaled yields measured in pp collisions .",
    "events are divided in classes based on the energy measured in the zero degree calorimeters located in the pb - going direction ( zna ) .",
    "the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions for the considered zna energy event class , @xmath18 , is calculated with the hybrid approach described in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dvsmult ] demonstrates that the @xmath19 of prompt d mesons for events with high and low multiplicities is compatible with unity within uncertainties , thus no multiplicity - dependent modification of d - meson production in p ",

    "pb collisions , the open heavy - flavour @xmath2 measured with alice in the different channels  @xcite shows a strong reduction of the yields at large trasverse momenta ( @xmath20  gev/@xmath21 ) in the most central collisions relative to a binary - scaled pp reference .",
    "this suppression is interpreted as due to charm quark in - medium energy loss .",

    "this is consistent with the expectation of a smaller in - medium energy loss for beauty than for charm quarks .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath2 of charged hadrons and pions is also done ( not shown ) : a similar suppression is observed , although the uncertainties do not allow yet to draw a conclusion on the colour - charge dependence of the in - medium energy loss .     of prompt d mesons and of non - prompt j/@xmath22 measured by cms  @xcite as a function of centrality , expressed in terms of the number of nucleons participating in the interaction .",
