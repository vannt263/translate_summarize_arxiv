    "with the development of the performance of computers , unsteady computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) is getting to be widely used for industrial applications such as the analysis of unsteady aerodynamics of road vehicles .",
    "however , it is usually challenging to identify the dominant characteristic unsteady flow structure around complex shaped objects such as a road vehicle , as the flow field consists of various flow structures with respect to time and length scale .",
    "dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd )  @xcite seems to be very useful tool to extract dominant dynamic flow structures from the complex flow field and its usage increases significantly in recent years . however , there are still some issues in the conventional dmd algorithm proposed by schmid  @xcite , especially for industrial applications .",
    "one issue is that the conventional dmd algorithm is very sensitive to the noise existing in the flow field  @xcite . for this issue ,",
    "hemati , et al .",
    "@xcite proposes a noise - robust dmd algorithm called total dmd ( total - least squared dmd ) which solves a total least - square problem instead of a least - square problem implicitly included in the conventional dmd algorithm .",
    "it is reported that this total dmd algorithm effectively removes the noise and result in better dmd modes compared to the conventional algorithms .",
    "@xcite another issue is that many dmd modes are obtained by dmd computation , when the target flow field is very complex .",
    "then , it is very difficult to identify the dominant dmd modes from all the obtained modes .",
    "many publications indicate that the importance of a dmd mode is judged by the amplitude of the dmd mode computed , according to  @xcite by assuming the dmd modes are good approximation of koopman modes . however , it is also reported that damped dmd modes often give very large amplitude , which affect the proper identification of dominant modes  @xcite . therefore , jovanovi , et al . ,  @xcite propose",
    "the optimal amplitude of dmd which is computed by solving the convex optimization problem of the minimizing error norm between the original dataset and the reconstructed dataset from dmd modes .",
    "in addition , a penalty parameter is introduced to the convex optimization problem in  @xcite , which selects some important modes from all the obtained modes with respect to the contribution for the approximation of the original dataset by remained dmd modes .",
    "it is the trade - off method between the accuracy of the approximation by dmd modes and the number of remained dmd modes , but it seems to be very useful to identify the dominant modes from many computed modes , especially for the case of a very complex flow field and in industrial applications .    in engineering applications of dmd ,",
    "one issue is that most dmd algorithms require massive computational resources with respect to memory consumption and data storage , since all datasets of the flow field used for the dmd process have to be saved during the cfd simulation and loaded on the memory space for computing the modes .",
    "however , it seems that using the current dmd process for an actual industrial application , especially for the development of new products , is unrealistic .",
    "it is because the results of cfd on engineering applications are represented by the high dimensional state of space , where , for example , the numbers of computational cells have already reached @xmath0 cells for the case of an unsteady cfd of a road vehicle",
    ". on - the - fly dmd algorithms such as streaming dmd ( sdmd )  @xcite and streaming total dmd ( stdmd )  @xcite seem to be very useful for engineering applications , as sdmd and stdmd can reduce memory consumption and it is not necessary to save flow field datasets on the storage . these on - the - fly algorithms of dmd compute matrices incrementally when the new snapshot vector is obtained from cfd , therefore , it is not necessary to save datasets of the flow field on the storage , and can be performed in parallel to the cfd simulation .",
    "in addition , matrices used for on - the - fly dmd algorithms are compressed after updated incrementally , which results in much less memory consumption than conventional dmd",
    ". however , there is one issue in algorithms of sdmd and stdmd with respect to the identification of dominant dmd modes from obtained modes .",
    "if many modes are required for the relevant computation of dmd , it seems to be still difficult to identify the dominant modes after dmd computation .",
    "however , spdmd introduced above can not be used after sdmd and stdmd computations , because of the lack of information for constructing the convex optimization problem .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we propose an alternative on - the - fly algorithm of dmd , which can be performed with spdmd . to achieve this algorithm , first",
    ", the alternative algorithm of total dmd ( alternative tdmd ) is proposed , which can be computed only by singular vectors and values of augmented snapshot matrix of the flow field .",
    "then , alternative tdmd can be performed on the fly , when incremental singular value decomposition ( incremental svd )  @xcite is performed instead of the conventional svd ( incremental tdmd ) .",
    "the advantage of the incremental tdmd algorithm compared to sdmd and stdmd is that spdmd can be performed after the incremental process , which seems to be useful for the identification of dominant modes , even if many modes are obtained by the on - the - fly dmd computation .",
    "therefore , incremental tdmd can be performed in parallel to cfd with less memory , without saving snapshots on the disk , which result in an efficient computation of dmd and easier identification of dominant modes in the flow field by applying spdmd after incremental process . in this paper , the flow field around the infinite square cylinder is simulated as a test case of dmd computations for validation purpose .",
    "first , alternative tdmd with spdmd is performed on the flow field and compared with conventional tdmd with spdmd , in order to validate the alternative tdmd algorithm .",
    "second , the incremental tdmd with spdmd is applied on the same flow field and the relevancy of the incremental tdmd algorithm for the identification of dominant modes compared to the conventional tdmd algorithms is investigated .",
    "in this section , algorithms of so - called conventional dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd )  @xcite are introduced , following descriptions of schmid  @xcite and tu , et al .",
    "@xcite . additionally , conventional total dmd ( tdmd , _ total least - square _ dmd , or _",
    "tls _ dmd )  @xcite , which is more noise - robust algorithm of dmd , is also introduced .",
    "next , the scaling method of dynamic modes , which is useful to investigate the contribution of each dmd mode to the original flow field before decomposed , is introduced .",
    "one of the scaling method is introduced by rowley , et al .",
    ", where scaling factor ( namely dmd mode amplitude ) is computed by using the first snapshot of velocity field .",
    "this scaling method is so far widely used , however , some issues are also reported in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , sparsity - promoting dmd ( spdmd ) is proposed by jovanovi , et al .  @xcite .",
    "spdmd compute optimal amplitudes by solving convex optimization problem of minimizing error norm .",
    "in addition , jovanovi et al . ,  @xcite introduced penalty parameter which induces sparsity structure of amplitude vector , and chose relatively important modes from all of obtained mode , which seem to be very useful to identify the dominant modes and flow structures from complex flow field",
    ". please note that , many svd operations are included in dmd algorithms .",
    "however , the method of snapshot  @xcite , instead of conventional svd , is adopted in this paper , to compute singular values and vectors in order to save memory and computational time for dmd computations , if there is no specification .",
    "for example , the conventional dmd algorithm performed by the method of snapshot is explained in the appendix.a .      dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) is a data - driven method of modal analysis which can extract dominant , coherent flow structures from complex , unsteady flow field .",
    "the objective of dmd is extracting dynamic information and its spatial structure described by eigenvectors and eigenvalues of dmd operator  @xmath1 which is described as follows , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are snapshot matrices consisting of snapshots of the flow field  @xmath5 which is recorded at a constant time interval @xmath6 .",
    "one solution to compute the dmd operator  @xmath7 is that solving the following equation .",
    "( @xmath8 represents moor - penrose pseudo - inverse of  @xmath9 ) @xmath10 however , it is usually difficult to derive dmd operator a and computing the eigendecomposition of  @xmath1 , as the number of states described by  @xmath11 is much bigger than the number of snapshots  @xmath12 in many cases of unsteady cfd in the field of applied aerodynamics .",
    "therefore , the most of dmd algorithm attempt to approximate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of  @xmath1 efficiently , with small computational resources .",
    "schmid , et al .",
    "@xcite , proposed the efficient algorithm to compute the eigendecomposition of a in low - dimensional approximation by using singular value decomposition ( svd ) , which is so far the most widely used as dmd algorithm . in this algorithm , dmd operator  @xmath13",
    "is projected on the left singular vectors of  @xmath9 which is expressed as  @xmath14 , then projected dmd operator @xmath15 is defined as follows , @xmath16 where the left singular vectors  @xmath14 are computed by svd on  @xmath17 , as follows .",
    "@xmath18 please note that the left singular vectors  @xmath14 represent the modes of proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod )  @xcite of  @xmath17 . therefore ,",
    "truncating the higher ranks of pod modes when projecting ( eq . ) , can work as a kind of filtering .",
    "it is because it is considered that the higher ranks of pod modes have less contribution to the original flow . substituting eq . in eq .",
    ", the projected dmd operator can be rewritten as follows .",
    "@xmath19 where pseudo - inverse of  @xmath17 is computed by using matrices derived by svd .",
    "@xmath20 then , eigendecomposition of projected dmd operator  @xmath21 is performed as follows .",
    "@xmath22 finally , unscaled dmd modes  @xmath23 are computed by projecting the eigenvectors  @xmath24 on the left singular vectors  @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath25 dmd modes describe spatial structure of the flow field extracted by dmd .",
    "eigenvalues  @xmath26 describe the amplification and damping rate and frequency of the flow structures extracted by the corresponding dmd modes .",
    "especially , frequency of the k - th dmd mode is computed as follows .",
    "@xmath27 again , dmd modes and their eigenvalues , which are computed through dmd operator , are regarded as low - dimensional approximation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of dmd operator  @xmath28 . according to the description by tu . , et al .",
    "@xcite , it can be explained by the following process .",
    "firstly , substituting eq . into eq .",
    ", eigendecomposition of projected dmd operator can be expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath29 please note that left singular vectors @xmath14 is orthogonal basis , therefore multiplying  @xmath30 to the right side of eq . does nt change the balance between left and right in the equation , then @xmath31 if pseudo - inverse of @xmath32 can be multiplied from left direction for left and right side of eq .",
    ", then eigendecomposition of dmd operator @xmath28 can be derived , by recognizing @xmath33 are eigenvectors of @xmath1 , as follows .",
    "@xmath34 hence , in other words , it is believed that any orthogonal basis can be used for constructing projecting dmd operator and for dmd computation , as long as the dimension is consistent in the algorithm .      in standard dmd algorithm , least - square problem",
    "is implicitly included , namely eq . is regarded as the _ least - squares _ solution to minimize as shown in the following .",
    "@xmath35 where noise existing in snapshot matrix  @xmath36 is represented as  @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , dmd finds a linear relationship between the snapshots  @xmath17 and the so - called noise - free snapshots  @xmath36 where noise  @xmath37 is removed .",
    "therefore , noise existing in  @xmath17 is not considered in conventional dmd algorithm , which means  @xmath17 and  @xmath36 are treated asymmetrically .",
    "this asymmetry induces a bias in the eigenvalues of  @xmath28 . in order to account for the noise in snapshot matrix  @xmath17 as well as  @xmath36 , hemati , et al",
    ". ,  @xcite proposed to solve the following `` _ _ total - least - square _ _ problem '' .",
    "@xmath38 in total dmd algorithm , above _ total - least - squares _ problem is solved by the projection of snapshot matrices on the best ` r - dimensional ' subspace determined by truncated svd on augmented snapshot matrix  @xmath39 which is represented as follows .",
    "@xmath40      = { \\bm{u_{z}}}_{:,1:r } { \\bm{{\\sigma}_{z}}}_{1:r } { { \\bm{w_{z}}}_{:,1:r}}^{t }         \\label{eq : svd_z_tls}\\ ] ] snapshot matrices  @xmath17 and  @xmath36 are projected on the subspace determined by the augmented matrix  @xmath39 , which result in namely noise - free snapshot dataset  @xmath41 and  @xmath42 as follows .",

    "it is reported that amplitudes of very damped modes are computed high and it is sometimes very difficult to identify the dominant mode by the dmd mode amplitude computed from first snapshot vector as described in the section 2.4  @xcite . in addition , if many modes are obtained by dmd computation , it is more difficult to identify dominant modes representing dominant flow structures , which can easily happen for the case of very complex flow field in engineering applications .",

    "the norm of entire flow field is considered to compute optimal amplitude , therefore , the effect of damping on the result of amplitude seems be more effectively removed .",
    "with respect to the approximation of the original flow field by the reconstruction from dmd modes , the optimal amplitude of dmd modes are approximated by minimizing the error norm between snapshot matrix of the original flow field and the reconstructed flow field from dmd modes , as follows . @xmath61",

    "@xmath72 is the positive regularization parameter which determine the sparsity of the amplitude vector @xmath69 .",
    "it means the stronger emphasis of the values of non - zero elements in amplitude vector @xmath69 by the larger @xmath72 , which results in smaller numbers of non - zero amplitudes are obtained .",
