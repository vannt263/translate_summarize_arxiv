    "most species live in systems of populations connected by dispersal , also known as metapopulations . while small local populations can go extinct frequently ( due to stochastic events , competition , predation and other factors ) , the whole metapopulation persists due to dispersal allowing for the recolonisation of empty patches and the rescuing of patches close to local extinction .",
    "levins @xcite provided the first mathematical representation of metapopulations .",
    "his approach takes the simplifying assumption of treating individual patches as either occupied or empty , thus ignoring the local patch dynamics .",
    "the total fraction @xmath2 of occupied patches changes as a function of time , and is described by levins equation : @xmath3 here @xmath0 is the rate ( per patch ) of successful colonisation of empty patches , and @xmath1 is the corresponding extinction rate .",
    "levins equation has formed the basis of most metapopulation modeling , and the basic model has been extended to account for a large number of additional factors , such as allowing for different patch sizes ( so - called core - satellite models ) , allee effects , and multi - species interactions .    despite the extensive literature on the behaviour of levins - like models ( summarised e.g. by etienne @xcite ) , a fundamental question has received limited attention : under which conditions , that is to say for which type of local dynamics do real metapopulations exhibit a levins - like behaviour ?",
    "keeling @xcite investigated numerically a metapopulation dynamics based on local coupled maps , in order to determine whether levins model is a good approximation .",
    "he found that for certain parameter values , the results of numerical simulations of the metapopulation fitted well to the form of levins equation ( similar results were obtained in @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : levins ] ) , but make no attempt at determining the rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite base their conclusions on a number of criteria ( e.g. levels of patch occupancy and turnover ) and conclude that on the brink of extinction the dynamics of their model is goverend by a levins - like balance between patch colonisations and extinctions .    even for conditions under which metapopulations can be shown to follow a levins - like behaviour @xcite ,",
    "it remains a challenge to parameterise the corresponding colonisation and extinction rates , as it requires long time series of censuses of a number of patches . while it is straightforward to generate such data from simulations , they are hard to obtain for empirical systems",
    "; indeed , this type of comprehensive data is rare in the ecological literature .",
    "@xcite for a study of an endangered butterfly population shown to behave levins - like .    a possible solution to this problem is to develop an analytical formulation of the local stochastic dynamics within a metapopulation framework , thus providing a direct link between local demographic parameters and the colonisation and extinction rates of patches at the metapopulation level .",

    "@xcite estimated metapopulation extinction times for the case of local dynamics with time - continuous birth - death dynamics . in a related approach , lande _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed an elegant stochastic generalisation of levins approach for continuous population dynamics , in order to quantify how the local patch dynamics affects the properties of the quasi - steady state of the metapopulation .",
    "however many population models commonly used in the literature are based on discrete time evolution in terms of non - overlapping generations of individuals . in such models , the dynamics",
    "is usually represented by a collection of coupled maps @xcite .",
    "examples are the logistic map , the ricker map @xcite , and the hassell map @xcite .    in the following",
    "we develop an analytical formulation of a metapopulation where the local population dynamics is governed by a stochastic version of the ricker map .",
    "we mention that the spatial structure of metapopulations with local ricker dynamics was investigated in    refs .",

    "we investigate under which conditions a metapopulation model based on ricker s map exhibits a levins - like behaviour .",
    "we then estimate patch colonisation and extinction rates ( the two key parameters in levins equation ) in terms of reproduction , survival and dispersal parameters of the local populations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first describe the metapopulation model .",
    "then we derive a deterministic law for the evolution of this population , in the limit of many patches .",
    "we then proceed to show how this dynamics simplifies when the population is close to extinction , and how a discrete version of levins equation ( [ eq : levins ] ) is obtained .",

    "our model consists of a population distributed among @xmath4 patches evolving in discrete , non - overlapping generations .",
    "it is closely related to the model studied numerically by keeling @xcite . during each generation , three processes take place , in this order : reproduction , survival to maturity , and dispersal .",
    "the first two phases occur within patches , and are described by a stochastic ricker map .",
    "the ricker map as it is commonly used corresponds to the deterministic dynamics : @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the number of adults in a local population in generation @xmath7 , the parameter @xmath8 characterises the average offspring size , that is , the fecundity rate .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 determines the probability of density - dependent survival ( such as the incidence rate of cannibalism by adults ) .",
    "stochasticity is added in the following manner .",
    "consider a patch with @xmath6 individuals in generation @xmath7 .",
    "we take the number of individuals after reproduction to be poisson  distributed with mean @xmath10 . during the second phase ,",
    "individuals survive to maturity independently with probability @xmath11 .",
    "thus the number of adults @xmath12 in the next generation is a random variable with mean equal to the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "during the third phase , the dispersal phase , individuals independently move away from the patch with probability @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the migrants from all patches are gathered in a common pool from where the target patch of each migrant is independently and randomly chosen , and thus the migrants are uniformly randomly distributed among all @xmath4 patches .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates this migration process .",
    "the pseudocode for the direct numerical simulations of the model described here is given in algorithm 1 .",
    "note that because we start from a poisson distributed number of offspring and use binomial sampling in the survival and dispersal phases , it follows that the patch population sizes are poisson distributed in each phase @xcite ( and that the population size is statistically independent between patches , conditional on the patch population sizes in the previous generation ) .",

    "this non - linearity is necessary for a quasi - stable steady state to exist .",
