    "in the standard view of the integer quantum hall effects ( iqhe),@xcite the hall resistance is quantized as @xmath0 when the longitudinal resistance vanishes .",
    "this is caused by random disorders .",
    "localization effects due to disorders are peculiar in two - dimensional electron system with strong magnetic field , which we call the quantum hall system hereafter .",
    "level density which is composed of discrete and degenerate landau levels in the system without disorders becomes to be composed of non - degenerate discrete levels in addition to degenerate levels in the system of disorders .",
    "the one - particle states in the center of energetically broadened landau levels are extended and those states outside the energy regions are localized .",
    "localized states have discrete energies and do not carry the bulk electric current .",
    "hence if the fermi energy is in the localized states region , the longitudinal resistance vanishes and there is no energy dissipation .",
    "the hall current is carried by the electrons in the extended states below the fermi energy and the hall resistance is quantized .",
    "thus the hall resistance is quantized when the longitudinal resistance vanishes .",
    "conversely if the fermi energy is in the extended state regions and electrons in these extended states would behave like ordinary gas and spread over whole spatial region , these electrons in the extended states cover whole spatial region and carry bulk electric current .",
    "hall resistance and longitudinal resistance are determined by current correlation functions and extended states give finite contributions .",
    "consequently the hall resistance deviates from one of the quantized value by an amount which is proportional to the longitudinal resistance .    in the finite system",
    "there are edges and current contacts .",
    "they play important roles in iqhe of finite systems . in the system of finite",
    "injected current , the potential around the current contacts is quite singular , because hall electric field is finite in the quantum hall system but vanishes in the inside of current contacts .",
    "there is a finite potential drop along the injected current .",
    "hence there is always energy dissipation around the current contacts and the bulk hall resistance becomes unquantized . the physical phenomena in other region , if they are caused by electrons in the extended states , are causally connected with those of current contact regions .",
    "thus if there are extended states at the fermi energy , hall resistance measured at any regions is unquantized .",
    "it is impossible to have the spatial region where there is no energy dissipation and the hall resistance is quantized .",
    "the hall resistance would never been quantized , then , regardless of the position where the hall potential is measured . on the other hand ,",
    "if the localized electrons causes the singular behavior around the current contact , the effect is confined in this region and does not give any effects at other regions . the hall resistance measured at different but suitable positions can be quantized .",
    "whether there exist regions where the hall resistance is quantized , it is important for the electrons at the fermi energy to be localized or to be confined in finite region .",
    "hence the thermodynamic properties of hall gas is important for the metrology of iqhe .",
    "actually unusual properties such as negative compressibility of hall gas have been known .",
    "we use the terminology , hall gas , for a many - body state of having continuous one - particle energy in the quantum hall system in this paper .",
    "several puzzling phenomena also have been observed not only in the medium mobility samples but also in the high mobility samples . in the medium mobility samples",
    ", the quantization of the hall resistance sometimes coexists with small longitudinal resistance and unusual breakdown phenomena of iqhe are induced by injected current . in the latter , iqhe are broken in two steps @xcite .",
    "the hall resistance becomes to deviate from the quantized value in the first step and the longitudinal resistance becomes large value in the second step .",
    "the first step is named the collapse of iqhe and the second step is named the breakdown of iqhe.@xcite in high mobility sample , highly anisotropic compressible states are discovered recently around half filling at higher landau levels.@xcite hartree - fock calculations@xcite and other numerical calculations@xcite on the stripe state seem to agree with the experiments .",
    "although this state is called the stripe state or unidirectional charge density wave from its density profile , we prefer to use anisotropic hall gas .",
    "this is because in this state fermi surface is defined .",
    "physical properties of the many - electron state is determined mainly from the electrons near fermi surface .",
    "so it is quite valuable to identify the fermi surface .",
    "it is seen clearly that the present hartree - fock states has anisotropic fermi surface and this many - body state behaves like gas .",
    "suitable representation that has a translational invariance is convenient to see this behavior explicitly .",
    "the von neumann lattice representation is such representation that meets this requirement .",
    "we use this representation and study physical properties of the hall gas state .",
    "we show that most of physical properties become clear from our viewpoint , which is the advantage of our method . although it was predicted that fluctuation effects change the stripe state into the liquid crystal or stripe crystal@xcite , we regard fluctuation effects are irrelevant to physics found experimentally in higher landau levels , as long as the anisotropic property is kept .",
    "we estimate higher order corrections of the energy and others from the residual interaction and find actually that the corrections are small .",
    "some physical properties have been given already in ref.(@xcite for the anisotropic compressible state and a connection with metrology of iqhe has been pointed out partly @xcite .",
    "we give a full argument in this work .",
    "we show in the present work that the hall gas has unusual thermodynamic properties and that the above puzzling phenomena become understandable .",
    "the unusual properties of hall gas insure the stability of iqhe .",
    "furthermore a new quantum hall regime with energy dissipations is derived .",
    "hall gas of anisotropic fermi surface obtained based on mean field theory on von neumann lattice is studied first .",
    "the hamiltonian has a translational invariance in the momentum space , called k - symmetry.@xcite the symmetry is broken spontaneously in the hall gas in which a single particle energy is generated self - consistently @xcite .",
    "this hall gas with uniform neutralizing background charge has negative pressure and compressibility .",
    "the hall gas state which preserves @xmath1-symmetry and breaks @xmath2-symmetry has fermi surface parallel to @xmath3 axis . in @xmath3 direction",
    "whole one - particle states within one landau level are filled completely and lowest energy empty states are in the next landau level .",
    "there is an energy gap of landau level in @xmath3-direction but there is no energy gap in the perpendicular direction .",
    "longitudinal resistance in this x - direction vanishes but the longitudinal resistance orthogonal to this direction becomes finite .    because center coordinates of hall gas are non - commuting ,",
    "the density profile of @xmath1 invariant anisotropic state is uniform in y - direction but is periodic in x - direction.@xcite thus fermi sea in momentum space and density in coordinate space become orthogonal .",
    "the system has anisotropic resistances and is regarded as anisotropic compressible gas observed at higher landau levels of high mobility samples.@xcite from its density profile the present anisotropic compressible state is equivalent to the stripe state@xcite or unidirectional charge density wave.@xcite response of the system under a periodic density modulation will be discussed also .    in medium mobility samples ,",
    "disorders are important . in",
    "the present work , long range disorder potential which is realized in gaas samples is studied .",
    "due to interplay between finite size effects and long range disorder effects a strip of conducting electron states is generated .",
    "compressible states formed by interaction in the localized state energy region , where one - particle energy is discrete , have negative compressibility .",
    "@xcite the strip is then formed",
    ". if the system has a finite size , furthermore , strip appears even without interaction from finite size effect .",
    "localized electrons with localization lengths of the system size or larger behave like the extended states .",
    "if the localization lengths are larger than the width but shorter than the length of the system , this state in the bulk region is like strip and is disconnected with either the source or drain region .",
    "we show unusual transport of the isolated strip in the bulk next .",
    "strip of extended electrons at fermi energy contributes to electric resistances through tunneling processes .",
    "if the injected current flows through the extended states in the lower landau levels , the current is induced in the strip of extended states at fermi energy at a finite temperature by tunneling .",
    "magnitude of the current and resistance are computed . in the hall bar sample with suitable sizes",
    ", the hall resistance can be quantized with a finite longitudinal resistance .",
    "this is a new regime of the iqhe and could occur at the finite injected current near the localized state region , i.e. , at @xmath4 .",
    "the strip thus leads to a new regime of iqhe , i.e. , dissipative quantum hall regime at @xmath4 .",
    "the unusual iqhe and breakdown due to current are also derived .",
    "thus the unusual properties of the hall gas states naturally explain unusual iqhe and breakdown observed in experiments .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , the anisotropic compressible mean field solutions obtained before is studied and their thermodynamic properties and the responses of the system to external potential modulation are computed .",
    "it is shown that anisotropic hall gas has negative pressure and compressibility . in sec .",
    "iii , strip of the hall gas states is analyzed .",
    "owing to the negative pressure , compressible gas states which are composed of electrons in extended states shrink and form strips .",
    "consequently they do not reach source or drain regions and do not contribute to the bulk electronic conductances at zero temperature . in sec .",
    "iv , transport properties of anisotropic compressible states at zero temperature are analyzed and compared with the recent experiments .",
    "current activation from lower landau levels to the strip of compressible gas around fermi energy at finite temperature is analyzed in sec .",
    "v and summary is given in sec .",
    "we use the von neumann lattice representation,@xcite which treats two - dimensional spaces symmetrically and preserves two - dimensional translational invariance . hence , electron operators have momentum , @xmath5 , which is defined in the magnetic brillouin zone and landau level index , @xmath6 .    the one - body hamiltonian , @xmath7 is written by the two sets of coordinates , guiding center coordinates @xmath8 and relative coordinates @xmath9 as , @xmath10 these coordinates satisfy commutation relations , @xmath11=-[x , y]={a^2\\over2\\pi i},\\label{comm}\\\\ & [ \\xi , x]=[\\xi , y]=[\\eta , x]=[\\eta , y]=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",

    "obviously the density is uniform in @xmath49 variable but is periodic in @xmath48 variable with a period @xmath51 .",
    "consequently the density profile of the hall gas is periodic in the k invariant direction and is uniform in the perpendicular direction.@xcite this reverse of direction is caused by the phase factor in eq .",

    "the present system has the rotational invariance .",

    "we study how the degeneracy is resolved by the one - dimensional periodic external potential .",

    "screened coulomb potential will be discussed in the next subsection . here",
    "@xmath64 is a band width of the @xmath6 th landau level .",
    "@xmath65 is almost unity for a small wave number @xmath66 .",
    "the second order correction vanishes at @xmath67 .",
    "the product of any operators that has momentum in @xmath3 direction always vanishes for @xmath1 invariant hall gas state .",
    "the degeneracy is resolved and the energy becomes minimum at @xmath68 .",
    "hence the @xmath1 hall state has lower energy and is realized in the system with @xmath49 dependent density modulation .",
    "@xmath1 invariant hall state has uniform density profile in @xmath49 direction and periodic density profile in @xmath48-direction .",
    "hence the hall gas state which has perpendicular density profile to external potential modulation is realized as shown in fig .",
    "this orthogonality is caused by the phase factor in the density operator@xcite and agrees with the recent experiment.@xcite    due to the effect of the residual interaction @xmath69 , which is obtained from the normal ordered product of @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) with respect to the hartree - fock ground state , the energy correction is modified slightly .",
    "when we apply the same approximation on the shape of one - particle energy spectrum , we see that the following term are added into the energy @xmath71 the first term is independent of the external modulation and simply shifts the ground state energy .",
    "but the second term , which is the first order term in @xmath69 , has a same dependence on external modulation as the lowest order term and is smaller than the first order term by factor five for @xmath72 . from the next order term , which is second order in @xmath69 ,",
    "the energy has a different dependence on the external modulation and does not vanish even if the angle @xmath67 .",
    "an angle independent term is generated when @xmath69 is multiplied first to the hartree - fock ground state and the hamiltonian of external modulation eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) is multiplied next .",
    "this term does not vanish but the magnitude is very small compared to the zeroth term eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) .",
    "thus higher order corrections from the residual interaction are small , although the energy correction at @xmath67 does not vanish .",
    "consequently , orthogonal phase has a lower energy than the parallel phase even though higher order corrections from the residual interaction are taken into account .",
    "our results are consistent with yoshioka s results@xcite based on the numerical calculation for the charge density wave qualitatively but give a deep insight for the reason of the phenomena.@xcite    in the experiments,@xcite it is suggested that the direction of the stripe order tends to be perpendicular to in - plane constant magnetic fields .",
    "this is consistent with the hartree - fock calculation.@xcite using the results obtained above , we can investigate the case of in - plane periodic magnetic fields .",
    "for example , in addition to the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath73 , we consider the in - plane periodic magnetic field @xmath74 .",
    "the vector potential for this in - plane magnetic field is given by @xmath75 .",
    "if we treat the additional term for @xmath76 as a perturbation , the same conclusion is obtained as the case of the periodic potentials .",
    "the second order correction becomes minimum when the stripe is uniform in the @xmath49 direction , which is perpendicular to the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "this result is consistent with the experiment of in - plane constant magnetic fields in @xmath77 limit .      in the quantum hall system",
    "the kinetic energy is frozen and coulomb potential is not screened in the lowest order . since the kinetic energy is generated by the unscreened coulomb potential , coulomb potential might be screened .",
    "if it happens , anisotropic hall gas may have different properties .",
    "it is important to know if the coulomb potential is screened .",
    "we study an implication of the screening and if the screening occurs in the self - consistent manner .",
    "if the coulomb potential is screened , fermi velocity becomes finite , and one - particle energy is given as , @xmath78 the denominator in the second order energy correction ( [ secc ] ) , is proportional to @xmath79 and the integration region is also proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "hence the second order correction due to long wavelength potential modulation becomes , @xmath80 which is very different from eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) and has no angle dependence .",
    "thus the energy correction is independent of the orientation of compressible states and the degeneracy is not resolved , when the coulomb potential is screened . since the degeneracy stays , the periodic external density modulation does not stabilize anisotropic hall state of a particular orientation .",
    "perhaps a symmetric state which is a linear combination of states of different orientations could be realized in this case . then anisotropic state would not be observed .",
    "now , we study if a self - consistent screened solution exists . to find a self - consistent screened solution ,",
    "we start from a screened coulomb potential @xmath81 @xmath82 we substitute this potential into the self - consistency condition ( [ sel ] ) and obtain self - consistent kinetic term for the electrons first . here",
    "@xmath83 is the thomas - fermi ( tf ) screening mass . from the one - particle energy",
    "thus obtained , new tf screening mass is calculated by the fermi velocity @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "the final value is compared with the original screening mass . in fig .",
    "6 , the computed tf screening mass is given as a function of the initial tf screening mass for @xmath86 . from this result",
    ", two values always agree at the origin , where screening effect vanishes .",
    "there is a second solution with finite screening length in the states of the lowest landau level . in this solution that has a finite screening length , one - particle state at the fermi energy",
    "has a finite velocity .",
    "hence , in the lowest landau level , the self - consistent screening is possible and anisotropic state may not be realized .    in higher landau levels ,",
    "the first solution of zero screening length exists but the second solution of finite screening length does not exist . in the first solution coulomb force is not screened and the previous self - consistent solution is the solution . in this solution",
    "the orientational degeneracy is resolved by the periodic external density modulation , and the hartree - fock state with anisotropic fermi surface of a particular orientation is stabilized .",
    "hence in the system of small density modulation , anisotropic hall gas is stabilized in high landau levels but anisotropic hall gas is not stabilized in the lowest landau level . instead , the screenning length is finite in the lowest landau level .",
    "our results are consistent with the facts that anisotropic states have been observed experimentally only in higher landau levels and the compressible state at the half - filling of the lowest landau levels is isotropic .    it should be noted that the new tf screening mass becomes negative for the half - filled second landau level in fig .",
    "this indicates the instability of the hall gas state which is consistent with the experiment at @xmath87 where the fractional quantum hall effect is observed.@xcite theoretically it is pointed out that the hall gas state is unstable to the cooper pairing@xcite at the half - filled second landau level .",
    "gas of negative pressure shrinks and strip of compressible gas is formed .",
    "a similar strip is formed also in the system of finite sizes and disorders due to their interplay .",
    "compressible states of negative pressure are deformed .",
    "uniform hall gas of the previous section is composed of electrons and uniform neutralizing background charges , which are composed of ions .",
    "the electrons are movable but the ions are not movable .",
    "consequently , when electrons shrink , charge neutrality is violated partly and static coulomb energy is added to the system s energy .",
    "we study this static coulomb energy here .",
    "we study how much the compressible gas of the filling factor @xmath88 shrinks in the system of length @xmath89 and the width @xmath90 due to negative pressure .",
    "we assume that the gas shrinks uniformly by @xmath91 in the width .",
    "the static coulomb energy per particle of this situation is given by , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a monotonically increasing function which behaves as @xmath94 in @xmath95 and diverges at @xmath96 logarithmically .",
    "this energy is added to the energy of the neutral system and the total energy of the system is obtained .",
    "the total energy is expressed as a function of the @xmath91 in fig",
    "the energy becomes minimum at one value of the @xmath91 .    at the above value",
    "the hall gas is stabilized and the pressure vanishes and the compressibility becomes positive .",
    "the value depends on the filling factor .",
    "@xmath91 nearly vanishes when the filling of the hall gas is large , and @xmath91 becomes finite if the filling is small .",
    "hence the hall gas is confined to strip state if the filling is slightly away from integer .      as was pointed out in the introduction , long range disorder potentials which are realized in gaas systems",
    "are studied in the present paper .",
    "disorder effects in finite system are analyzed in this subsection .",
    "localized states due to disorders have discrete energies and finite localization lengths .",
    "these states have normalizable wave functions that vanish at infinite spatial region .",
    "hence electrons in these states neither carry the bulk electric current nor contribute to electric conductances in the infinite system . in finite systems ,",
    "however , localized states could behave like extended states if localization lengths are larger than or equal to the system size .",
    "they contribute to the electronic conductances if they have finite wave functions at current contact regions .",
    "thus it is convenient to classify the one - particle energy region to several regime depending upon their localization lengths and the systems sizes .",
    "there are three systems sizes .",
    "one is the length of the system , @xmath97 , the second one is the width in the hall probe region , @xmath98 , and the third one is the width in the potential probe region , @xmath99 . generally the first one is the largest , the second one is medium , and the third one is smallest .",

    "one - particle wave functions are extended if its energy is in the center of landau levels and cover whole spatial region from one end to another end in the system of no interactions .",
    "interaction , however , modifies the many - body wave functions and compressible hall gas of negative pressure is formed . due to negative pressure , which is obtained in the previous section , this hall gas shrinks .",
    "the strip of compressible states is formed .",
    "they have energies near the center of landau levels .",
    "second one is due to disorders in the finite systems .",
    "wave functions in the collapse regime and dissipative qhr bridge from one edge to another edge and are like stripe even without interactions . thus the strip is formed in the extended states region , in the collapse regime , and in the dissipative qhr .",
    "the electric resistances of the strip state are studied in the sec .",
    "in this section , the transport of the system when the anisotropic hall gas fills whole spatial regions is studied .",
    "it is convenient to define a new basis called current basis,@xcite where electron operators satisfy naive ward - takahashi identity between the vertex part and the propagator , first .",
    "let us define a unitary matrix and transform the electron operators @xmath112 and the propagator @xmath113 : @xmath114 electric current are expressed with these operators as @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "the charge density satisfies the commutation relation : @xmath117\\delta(t - t')= -{\\tilde b}_l({\\bf p}-a\\hat{\\bf k})\\delta(t - t ' ) .",

    "this gives important and powerful ward - takahashi identity and other relations . from this relation the following ward - takahashi identity between the vertex part and the propagator of the matrix form is derived , @xmath118 the hall conductance is expressed by the topological invariant expression,@xcite @xmath119 in the qhr , this formula gives quantized value @xmath120 . in the finite systems the momentum becomes discrete , and the expression ( [ topo ] ) , is valid and the value is quantized exactly as well.@xcite the systems of many - body interactions is treated by perturbative expansion . since the current conservation and the commutation relations between the charge density and the field operators are kept intact in the system of interaction , the full propagator and full vertex part which include interaction effects satisfy ward - takahashi identity , eq.([wt ] ) .",
    "hence the renormalized quantities also satisfy the same ward - takahashi identity and the topological formula of the hall conductance,@xcite is written by the renormalized propagator in the current basis . in the qhr there is no extended states at fermi energy and the hall conductance stays at the exact quantized values .",
    "the value is not modified by the interactions .",
    "now we study the hall gas regime .",
    "the free hamiltonian , @xmath121 is given by the non - diagonal form , @xmath122 using the energy eigenvalues of the previous section for the hall gas we find the propagator in the current basis . the propagator is given around the fermi energy as @xmath123 in the energy basis , where @xmath62 was computed in section 2 .",
    "we substitute eq.([uni ] ) and eq.([prop ] ) to eq.([topo ] ) , and we have @xmath124 at @xmath125 . thus the hall conductance is proportional to the filling factor in the hall gas regime .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant anisotropic hall gas states at @xmath126 have the fermi surface parallel to @xmath3 axis . in @xmath3 direction",
    ", there is no empty state within the same landau level .",
    "this direction is like the integer quantum hall state .",
    "thus , longitudinal conductance in this direction vanishes . in the @xmath45 direction ,",
    "the system behaves like one - dimensional.@xcite we assume that the small voltage probe contact is attached in the edge region .",
    "the current in this region is due to one - dimensional edge mode which has @xmath45-dependent one - particle energy in addition to hall electric field dependent one - particle energy .",
    "the latter energy corresponds to one chiral mode which does not dissipate energy and gives the ordinary hall resistance as were shown by halperin@xcite and buttiker@xcite but the former one - particle energy corresponds to both chiral modes and dissipate energy .",
    "we apply landauer formula to this part of the energy .",
    "the velocy is given as , @xmath127 and number of states of the extended states in the chemical potential difference @xmath128 , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the correction term which comes from the phase shift @xmath131 due to impurity scattering .",

    "( [ v ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , we have total current @xmath132 where @xmath133 is voltage in @xmath49 direction and the chemical potential difference @xmath128 is replaced with @xmath134 .",
    "the precise value of the correction term @xmath135 is not known .",
    "it is , however , expected that @xmath136 when the landau level index goes to infinity from the scaling theory of anderson localization in the system of zero magnetic field , and @xmath135 vanishes in the ideal system with no impurities .",
    "we have , hence , conductance @xmath137 the resistance in @xmath48 direction becomes finite and vanishes in @xmath49 direction . if the compressible states carry a small amount of current , which occurs when the filling factor slightly deviates from integer , the above value gives the proportional constant between the voltage and the current generated by the compressible states .",
    "the transport properties of the strip of compressible hall gas which covers a small part of the whole system and is disconnected from current contacts are studied in this section .",
    "if the current is induced in this strip of compressible states , this current generates longitudinal resistance .",
    "whereas in other part which has no compressible states , hall resistance is quantized .",
    "thus a new quantum hall regime where the hall resistance is quantized exactly in the system of finite longitudinal resistance is derived .      as shown in sec .",
    "iii , strip formed from localized electrons of localization lengths between the width and length of the system in which the width is smaller than length does not reach at least to one current contact and injected current does not flow through the strip at zero temperature .",
    "strip in this situation has peculiar transport properties and gives important effects to the iqhe with finite injected currents at finite temperature .",
    "we study the situation where several lower landau levels are filled completely and one landau level is partially filled as shown in fig .  10 .",
    "the current - carrying strip is formed in the highest landau level and bridges one side to the other side .",
    "although fermi energy is in the strip state energy region , the strip is disconnected from the current contacts",
    ". injected electric current flows through the lower landau levels , and does not flow through the isolated compressible states of higher landau levels if there is no interaction . in reality",
    "the interaction exists and modifies the isolated states . at finite temperature",
    "the current is activated into the isolated strip states from lower landau levels as shown in fig .",
    "we study the effects of coulomb interaction at finite temperature and find that the strip states have small amount of electric current at low temperature .",
    "the magnitude of induced current depends on injected current as well as on temperature .    from fermi - dirac statistics ,",
    "particles are filled first in the lowest energy level and second in the next levels and so on .",
    "the dissipation occurs only near the fermi surface and does not occur at the lower energy levels . in the quantum hall system ,",
    "the bulk current is carried by the electrons in lower levels and in the levels near fermi surface .",
    "so in the present situation shown in fig.10 , dissipationless current flows in the lower levels and induced current in the stripe in the middle of sample near fermi surface dissipates energy .",
    "this is very different from and should not be confused with ordinary parallel circuit .",
    "the second order correction from the coulomb interaction which is expressed in feynman diagram of fig .",
    "11 gives the induced current to the strip states .",
    "one electron line ( double line ) stands for those of lower landau levels which are connected with current contacts and are carrying current .",
    "thus these states depend on the hall electric field.@xcite the other line ( solid line ) stands for those of strip states around fermi energy which are disconnected from current contacts and are not carrying current in the lowest order . the dashed line stands for the coulomb interaction . to compute induced electric current , the current operator is inserted in the strip state line and is shown as wavy line in fig .  11 .",
    "we express operators , propagators , vertices , and others in the current basis .",
    "the induced current is calculated as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the propagator which depends on the hall electric field @xmath140 and @xmath141 is the propagator for the stripe states which does not depend on @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath142 is the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath40 is in between @xmath143 and @xmath144 . in the above calculation",
    ", we considered only the mixing term between the landau levels @xmath143 and @xmath144 which is the dominant term in the induced current .",
    "the asymmetric parameter is fixed at @xmath145 for simplicity . then the induced current reads @xmath146 where @xmath147 is an effective hall electric field @xmath148 , which is enhanced by the strong localization effect.@xcite in experiments,@xcite @xmath149 is on the order of 10 .    the induced current is given by , @xmath150 the value depends on the hall electric field , the total current , and the temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence is of activation type and the gap energy is linear in @xmath140 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the current is of activation type .",
    "at relatively high temperature , the electron temperature is the same as that of the whole system . at low temperature",
    ", however , the electron temperature is different from the system s temperature and is determined from the energy due to the electric resistance and the heat conduction from the electron system to the lattice system .",
    "the temperature determines the electric resistance and conversely the electric resistance determines the temperature .",
    "hence they are determined self - consistently.@xcite    the induced current of the strip depends on the total injected current through the hall electric field .",
    "effective band width ( [ eh ] ) of extended landau levels in the system of hall electric field increases with hall electric field .",
    "this agrees with the experiments of the breakdown of the iqhe due to the injected current , where the activation energy depends on the injected current .",
    "so we use these previous results in the present work .",
    "the total longitudinal resistivity is the ratio between the induced electric field in the compressible gas region and the current density and is given as , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the longitudinal resistivity of the stripe state .",
    "the particular dependence of the longitudinal resistance on the hall field is obtained for the first time .",
    "this result are compared with the experiment of kawaji et al.@xcite in fig .",
    "12 . in the experiment ,",
    "the filling factor is 4 , magnetic field is 5.7 t , and the temperature is 0.75 k. the electron temperature could be different from the above value due to heating effect and is not known experimentally .",
    "so we fit the theoretical curve by changing the temperature , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 . as shown in fig .  12 ,",
    "reasonable agreements are obtained when the temperature is 1.576 k , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this temperature is that of the electron system at the strip and is different from the experimental value which is at the lattice system .",
    "the large deviation at large hall electric fields is caused by the breakdown of iqhe .",
    "the transport properties of the finite system depends on the system sizes , the position of the fermi energy , and the magnitude of the induced current .",
    "if the width in the hall probe region is wider than the width in the potential probe region , longitudinal resistance and hall resistance behave very differently .",
    "we see that breakdown should occur in two steps .    as the current increases , mobility edges move and the localization length increases .",
    "when the localization length of a state reaches the width of only the potential probe region , this state contributes to longitudinal resistance but not to the hall resistance .",
    "potential probe region has an temperature dependent electric resistance of activation type .",
    "the hall probe region has still only localized states which have shorter localization lengths than the width .",
    "hence the hall probe region is considered as the qhr in this region .",
    "the hall resistance measured in the wider hall probe region becomes that of the finite system in the localized state region where momentum variables become discrete . as was shown in eq .",
    "( [ topo ] ) , the hall resistance is written as a peculiar topological invariant form in the momentum space . the integrand is determined by the magnetic field and has no dependence on spatial component of the momentum .",
    "hence this topological invariant does no change the value even when the integration variables are replaced with those of finite system , discrete values .",
    "thus this has no finite size corrections in the localized state region.@xcite hence the hall resistance measured in the present situation agrees with the exactly quantized value .",
    "thus resistivities at low temperature are given in our theory as , @xmath158 where @xmath159 is temperature independent .",
