    "nevertheless , the upper left panel of fig .  [ slopes ] shows clearly that the strong blue tilt for gcs in the high - mass sample is not driven by the brightest gcs alone since the open circles are consistently above the crosses .",
    "this plot also demonstrates once again that the blue tilt is more pronounced in the virgo data . in this context",

    "there is , however , no significant red tilt detected in the full sample of all gcs . given this and the fact that the colour distribution in the red peak is generally asymmetric ( see figs . 2 and 5 of peng @xcite ) , the evidence for a red tilt should still be considered preliminary .",
    "we note that a weak tilt is broadly consistent with the gc self - enrichment scenario , where the pre - enrichment level of red ( metal - rich ) gcs is significantly higher than that of the blue ( metal - poor ) gcs , thereby making the detection of any self - enrichment more difficult ( e.g. acsvcs xiv , strader & smith  @xcite , bailin & harris  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude this section with a note of caution regarding the detection of tilts , red or blue : the colors of individual gcs typically scatter significantly about the individual peak positions by 0.1 - 0.2 mag . this scatter  likely caused by stochastic variation in the gc pre - enrichment level  will allow the detection of any mass - metallicity trend only for systems of at least a few hundred gcs . the significance of the blue tilt detection in the gc system of the disk galaxy ngc 5170 ( forbes et al .",

    "_ 2008 ) .",
    "this particular set of model parameters does not reproduce the data for either the high - mass nor the low - mass sample .",
    "most notably , the observations point to an onset of the blue tilt at @xmath103 , while the reference model predicts self - enrichment to become important only above @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , the relation between mass and metallicity predicted by the model in the self - enrichment mass regime is @xmath105 .",
    "this is significantly steeper than the observed relation of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the data require a lower mass for the onset of self - enrichment than in the reference model , but at the same time , a weaker scaling between metallicity and mass in the self - enrichment regime . one way of achieving this is to assume a radial density profile that is steeper than an isothermal sphere : fig .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] shows that the particular choice of @xmath107 matches very well the observed mass - metallicity scaling for the high - mass sample .",
    "for such a profile , self - enrichment is able to start at lower cloud masses due to the deeper potential well in the cloud center , but its efficiency increases more gradually with increasing cluster mass ( given that only a small fraction of gas is located close to the edge of the proto - cluster cloud ) . for the low - mass sample ,",
    "the data require a variation of @xmath108 with cloud mass in the sense that lower - mass clouds have a steeper profile than higher - mass clusters ; the shallower tilt for this sample can otherwise not be reproduced . the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] corresponds to the particular choice of @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "an alternative way to match the observations for the high - mass sample is to adopt a lower star formation efficiency of @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that the progenitor cloud for a gc of a given mass was twice as massive as in the reference model , yielding a correspondingly larger metal retention fraction , and hence , a lower _ present - day _ onset mass for self - enrichment .",
    "at the same time , the choice of a lower @xmath88 reduces the overall efficiency of self enrichment , that is , the slope between [ z / h ] and mass ( equ .",
    "[ ztot ] ) .",
    "for the low - mass sample , however , the curves with lower star formation efficiency do not reproduce the observed scaling of metallicity with mass .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the assumption of a constant cloud radius is not necessary to reproduce the observations .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] shows that clouds with constant density ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) can also have levels of self - enrichment that are in agreement with the observations .",
    "finally , we note that radiative feedback from massive stars also contributes to regulating star formation , with the total radiative energy input from ob stars into the ism being more than an order of magnitude lower than the energy injected by snii ( baumgardt et al .",
    "despite the lower amount of energy involved , radiative feedback may be an important factor for halting star formation in massive clusters ( e.g. krumholz & matzner  @xcite , fall et al .",
    "@xcite ) in the few million years before the first snii explode .",
    "this effect is not considered in the self - enrichment scenario discussed in the present paper , since we focus on the reprocessing of metals ejected by snii , which dominate the budget of metal - enriched material in a star cluster .",
    "we have shown that the mass - metallicity scaling relation , and the difference between gcs in high - mass and low - mass samples , may be explained if the density profiles of the proto - cluster clouds are generally steeper than isothermal spheres , and if the density profiles for the proto - cluster clouds in the low - mass sample depended weakly on mass .",
    "another effect that may contribute to the observed trends is that , for larger cluster masses , an increasing fraction of proto - cluster clouds with low star formation efficiency survive their formation ( baumgardt _ et al . _",
    "this is possible since , for higher - mass clusters , gas expulsion will tend to happen more adiabatically and the tidal radius is larger , so that clusters will have more room for expansion folllowing gas expulsion .",
    "this possibility is also supported by the finding of baumgardt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that , in order to turn a power - law cluster mass function into the commonly observered log - normal one ( e.g. , jordn  @xcite and references therein ) , a larger fraction of high mass clusters has to survive gas expulsion .",
    "environmental variations in the importance of these effects are certainly conceivable : e.g. , in the sense that metal retainment is favoured in the central parts of high - mass galaxies with external pressure confinement , different from regions in lower mass galaxies with a weaker external pressure ( e.g. , parmentier  @xcite , recchi & danziger  @xcite ) .",
    "these variations may well influence the resulting mass - metallicity relation of gcs .",
    "however , such smooth trends can hardly explain the gross differences between the gc cmd morphology for galaxies of similar morphological type and luminosity , as is the case for m49 , m87 and ngc  1399 ( fig .",
    "[ 3giants ] and fig .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] ) . instead",
    ", these differences may indicate that individual merger or accretion events have altered their gc populations ( e.g. , ct  @xcite or hilker  @xcite ) , and hence contributed to modulating the blue tilt .",
    "this modulation might take the form of intermediate - age gcs formed in gas - rich mergers , the dissipationless accretion of gcs belonging to gas - poor galaxies , or both ( see the reviews of west @xcite and brodie & strader  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the variations in the color - magnitude relations among different subsamples is considered by blakeslee _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors show that the non - linear relationship between gc color and metallicity may lead to different tilts in color space between samples of different mean metallicity , even though the underlying gc mass - metallicity relations may be quite similar . in the present paper",
    "we adopt a color - metallicity tranformation based on 95 gcs in the milky way , m49 and m87 ( peng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , the same data set which",
    "is also adopted for the colour - metallicity transformation by blakeslee _",
    "et al . _",
    "since we do see a difference in the mass - metallicity relation between gcs in high - mass and low - mass galaxies , not only in color - magnitude space , it appears likely that the effect considered by blakeslee _",
    "_ is in our case not the only cause for the environmental variation .",
    "an important step forward in this context would be to obtain accurate spectroscopic metallicity measurements for an expanded sample ( e.g. , cohen @xcite and @xcite ) of gcs in the virgo and fornax galaxies that define the tilt and its variations .",
    "having constrained the conditions under which self - enrichment can reproduce the observed blue tilt , it is worth exploring the extent to which colour changes due to dynamical evolution of gcs may also contribute to shaping the observed trends . in the context of the environmental variations of the tilt ,",
    "this issue is worth considering in some more detail since the dynamical evolution of star clusters is known to depend strongly on the external tidal field and hence varies as a function of environment .",
    "two recent studies investigate the effects of tidal dissolution of star clusters on their integrated colors ( kruijssen & lamers  @xcite ; anders _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , based on the n - body star cluster simulations of baumgardt & makino  @xcite . of these two studies , anders _ et al . _",
    "@xcite perform a more sophisticated treatment of the evolution of the stellar mass function change with time , resulting in somewhat smaller predicted color changes .",
    "both studies predict star cluster colors at a determined age and metallicity as a function of the ratio t@xmath112 between current age and dissolution time .",
    "generally , color changes start to set in after @xmath830.4 dissolution time scales .",
    "to determine whether these changes can be responsible for the tilt , we estimate the amount of color change that has occured in the gcs of the combined vcs and fcs sample .",
    "we adopt a @xmath20-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath113 , independent of @xmath21 color ( jordn et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as the fractional dynamical age , @xmath114",
    ", we define the ratio of the current age to the dissolution time . in the context of the gc dissolution scenario discussed in jordn _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , this can also be expressed as the ratio between present - day and primordial mass . using the present - day mass , @xmath115 , and the accumulated mass loss , @xmath116",
    ", we find :    @xmath117    we assume @xmath116 to be equal for all gcs in a given host galaxy , adopting @xmath118 for high - mass galaxies and @xmath119 for low - mass galaxies ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "16 of jordn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] we show the peak positions fitted to the cmds of gcs from the combined fcs and vcs high - mass and low - mass samples .",
    "we also show quadratic fits to the peak positions . in each luminosity bin",
    "we calculate the mean gc mass , the mean host galaxy magnitude and adopt @xmath116 in equation  [ delta ] accordingly , yielding an average @xmath114 for the gcs in each luminosity bin .",
    "we then calculate an estimate for the color change at each luminosity bin , adopting the predictions by kruijssen & lamers  @xcite in the @xmath120 bands as a function of @xmath114 .",
    "we use @xmath121 ( peng et al .",
    "2006 ) to convert to @xmath21 colors .",
    "the results are indicated by the long - dashed magenta lines .",
    "it is apparent that non - negligible color changes are expected for only the low - luminosity gcs : for @xmath122 mag in the high - mass sample , and @xmath123 mag for the low - mass sample .",
    "moreover , the predicted strong changes in the red peak for the low - mass do not at all agree with the observational data .",
    "this comparison thus supports the relatively small color changes predicted by anders et al .",
    "@xcite ; we therefore conclude that dynamical evolution may be responsible for a weak color - magnitude trend among low - mass gcs , but certainly not for the strong tilt exhibited by the more massive clusters .",
    "we also note that the mass - loss of star clusters only has a very small effect on the self - enrichment estimates presented in the previous section .",
    "this is illustrated by two example self - enrichment model calculations in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ cmdphotev ] .",
    "the thin short dashed and thin solid line show the respective thick line model variations assuming a constant mass loss of @xmath118 to have occured for all clusters .",
    "the effect on the reference model by bailin & harris is negligible , and the effect for the model variations that fit the data corresponds to a 10 - 15% change in slope .",
    "a 0.15 dex lower pre - enrichment metallicity is required for the predictions that include mass - loss to match the predictions without mass - loss .",
    "a color - magnitude relation for metal - poor gcs  the  blue tilt \"  is now a well established observational result . from a cmd analysis based on a sample of @xmath1 17000 gcs detected in the acs virgo and fornax cluster surveys ,",
    "we identify a clear environmental variation in the slope of the gc color - magnitude relation : i.e. , the slope of the color - magnitude relation is largest for the highest - mass galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we confirm that there are real , galaxy - to - galaxy differences in the amount of tilt at comparable galaxy luminosity and mass : e.g. , m87 and ngc  1399 show significant blue tilts , while m49 does not ( mieske  2006 , strader 2006 ) .    a comparison to predictions from models of gc self - enrichment ( bailin & harris  @xcite ) suggest that this mechanism offers a promising explanation for the observed relation and may be able to constrain the conditions under which star formation took place in proto - cluster clouds . within the context of this model ,",
    "the observed shape of the color - magnitude relation suggests that protocluster clouds had density profiles somewhat steeper than isothermal in the highest - mass galaxies ( @xmath124 ) . for the lower mass galaxies , a weak mass dependence for the structure of the protocluster clouds",
    "is required to match the observations ( with @xmath108 in the range @xmath125 for masses @xmath126 ) .",
    "this interpretation , however , is not unique .",
    "other variants on this same basic picture also appear consistent with the observations , including models in which the clouds have constant density ( @xmath127 ) and/or relatively low star formation efficiencies 0.15 - 0.20 .    however , we point out that the significant differences in the detailed cmds for some galaxies of similar mass and morphological type pose a challenge to single generic mechanisms , such as self - enrichment , that attempt to explain gc color - magnitude relations .",
    "these differences suggest that the detailed ( and stochastic ) merger / accretion histories of individual galaxies will play a role shaping the appearance overall gc cmds .",
    "we conclude that further insights into the blue tilt phenomenon now await optical spectroscopy for large , representative gc samples covering the upper 3 - 4 magnitudes of the gc luminosity function , where the color - magnitude relation is most apparent . at the distances of the fornax and virgo clusters ,",

    "<S> the tilt is stronger for gcs belonging to high - mass galaxies ( @xmath6 ) than for those in low - mass galaxies ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also more pronounced for gcs with smaller galactocentric distances . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest a range of mass - metallicity relations @xmath8 which vary as a function of host galaxy mass / luminosity , a scaling similar to that observed for dwarf spheroidal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our observations to a recent model of star cluster self - enrichment with generally favorable results . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that , within the context of this model , the proto - cluster clouds out of which the gcs formed may have had density profiles slightly steeper than isothermal and/or star formation efficiencies somewhat below 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> we caution , however , that the significantly different appearance of the cmds defined by the gc systems associated with galaxies of similar mass and morphological type pose a challenge to any single mechanism , including self - enrichment , that seeks to explain generically the observed gc color - magnitude relations . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that the detailed ( and stochastic ) merger / accretion histories of individual galaxies have likely played a non - negligible role determining the distribution of gcs in the color - magnitude diagrams of individual gc systems . </S>"
