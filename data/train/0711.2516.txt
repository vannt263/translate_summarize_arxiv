    "we are at a stage of exploring new physics at the energy scale of tev . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will break us into such new energy frontier and seek for the possible signals of new physics . typically , most models beyond the standard model ( sm ) predict some massive spin one particles , whose masses come from spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking ( sgsb ) of an extended gauge sector or compactification of extra dimensions with natural boundary conditions . the fact that gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously is important because the  bad \" high energy behavior induced by the longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons is vitiated by the ward identity so that unitarity is not violated in perturbation theory@xcite . although this is automatically guaranteed from a model - buildng point of view , unitarity might be violated in the theory we reconstruct from lhc observables for two reasons .",
    "the first one is that the new sgsb sector becomes strongly coupled at high energies@xcite so that high order diagrams will come to rescue the tree - level unitarity violation .",
    "the second one is the apparent explicit violation of gauge invariance as one ca nt observe the full sgsb sector .",
    "the heavy massive particles and especially their interactions to the light particles we observe do play an important role to maintain the ward identity of the spontaneous broken gauge symmetry .",
    "since the theory we are interested in is either a four dimensional theory with some sgsb sector or with compactified extra dimensions , we will use the language of deconstruction@xcite as a unified description in different simple models to illustrate how the new physics at high energy maintains unitarity .    before talking about the unitarity bounds seriously",
    ", we must determine which particles could be found and what couplings could be measured at lhc . for fermions and gauge bosons ,",
    "we will make two simple assumptions .",
    "first , fermions tend to be harder to discover than gauge bosons with the same mass .",
    "second , measuring massive gauge boson self - couplings is very hard at lhc . with such assumptions",
    ", we will choose a minimal set of particles and interactions to begin with .",
    "although it is very simple , it does illustrate all related physics and could be the realistic case that we observe at lhc . in the mean time",
    ", it is also very easy to extend to more complicated cases which i will comment at the end of this paper .",
    "let s imagine that we observe a massive spin one particle @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 at lhc .",
    "@xmath2 will decay into some fermion @xmath4 with mass @xmath5 .",
    "we measure its couplings to the left and right components of @xmath4 and we find the axial coupling @xmath6 is nonzero - matrix as the latter is a tree level effect .",
    "we will clarify the issue of gauge anomalies in a separate paper . ] .",
    "we know nothing about the @xmath7 self - interactions and perhaps we do nt know if it couples to other light gauge bosons or not , so we will not consider the four gauge boson scattering amplitude to give a unitarity bound .",
    "instead , we consider @xmath8",
    ". there are feymann diagrams from t - channel and u - channel @xmath4 exchange and s - channel @xmath2 and other gauge boson exchange if @xmath2 is charged under some non - abelian gauge group .",
    "however , only the symmetric part of the t - channel and u - channel @xmath4 exchange will contribute to the @xmath9 partial wave scattering amplitude .",
    "the leading order bad behaved processes are from the chirality - conserving channel such as @xmath10 and they are proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the center of mass energy .",
    "however , the @xmath9 partial wave scattering amplitude from t - channel and u - channel @xmath4 exchange will cancel each other .",
    "the next leading order ones are from chirality - nonconserving channels such as @xmath13 and they are proportional to @xmath14 . the corresponding feymann diagrams with one mass insertion from t - channel @xmath4 exchange are presented in fig [ feydiag ] . the total amplitude for the abelian case is @xmath15 where we assume @xmath16 . for the non - abelian case @xmath17 , the color factor",
    "@xmath18 is @xmath19/n}$ ] where we drop the piece proportional to @xmath20 in the amplitude which does not contribute to @xmath9 partial wave scattering amplitude .    to satisfy the partial wave unitarity , the tree - level @xmath9 partial wave amplitude extracted from eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) @xmath21 must be smaller than 1/2 .",
    "@xmath18 represents the color factor where @xmath22 is for the abelian case and @xmath23 is for the non - abelian case .",
    "this produces the bound @xmath24 .",
    "if we define the spin - singlet combination for the initial state fermions , @xmath25 $ ] @xcite , we may make the bounds slightly tighter , @xmath26",
    "we consider two two site @xmath17 moose models with completely different new physics that maintains the unitarity . in the first model a",
    ", there is a new massive fermion @xmath27 that contributes to scattering @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding moose diagram is presented in fig [ fig : moosea ] . the gauge coupling in each moose is @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the fermion charged under gauge group @xmath30 has a dirac mass term @xmath31 .",
    "the bifundamental scalar field @xmath32 , which we will call the  link \" field , has a yukawa coupling @xmath33 .",
    "the link field gets a vev @xmath34 and spontaneously breaks @xmath35 and @xmath30 into the diagonal group @xmath36 .",
    "such a spontaneous symmetry breaking could be realized both linearly and nonlinearly in our case and it wo nt affect the main results in our discussion .",
    "the kinetic term for the link field will become the mass term for the massive gauge boson @xmath37 \\supset { u^2 } ( g_a a_{\\mu}^a - g_b b_{\\mu}^a)^2 /2   = { u^2 g^2 } ( g_{\\mu}^{1a})^2 /2   $ ] . the decomposition between gauge bosons in the mass eigenstate and gauge eigenstate are @xmath38 and @xmath39 where we define @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for the fermion sector , the yukawa coupling and dirac mass term @xmath43 contribute to the fermion mass term @xmath44 we define @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the decomposition between left handed fermions in the mass eigenstate and gauge eigenstate are @xmath48 and @xmath49 while for the right handed fermions , the gauge eigenstate is the mass eigenstate , which is @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "if we write the gauge boson - fermion interactions in the mass eigenstate , we will find the couplings between massless gauge boson @xmath52 and fermions are universal @xmath53 because of @xmath36 gauge invariance .",
    "the couplings between massive gauge boson @xmath2 and different weyl fermions are different , and they are presented in fig [ fig : feymrule ] .",
    "the fermion @xmath4 is massless , and we can introduce its mass through a gauge invariant mass term @xmath54 such a mass term could come from a yukawa interaction @xmath55 with a singlet scalar field @xmath56 in the moose .",
    "we can see that the mass term for @xmath4 is always accompanied with a mixed mass term and the ratio is @xmath57 .",
    "armed with these interactions and mass terms , we can compute the amplitudes from all feymann diagrams with different interactions and mass insertions .",
    "those from t - channel fermion exchange are presented in fig [ feydiagab ] ( a ) @xmath58 ( g ) .",
    "if we omit the common factor @xmath59 , those amplitudes from different diagrams are : @xmath60 ( a ) @xmath61 ( b ) @xmath62 ( c ) @xmath63 ( d ) @xmath64 ( e ) @xmath65 ( f ) @xmath66 ( g ) @xmath67 summing over all amplitudes from diagram ( a)@xmath58(g ) , we can see that the whole result proportional to @xmath12 is zero and unitarity is not violated .",
    "the mixed mass term @xmath68 will rotate the mass eigenstate and introduce extra pieces for the new mass eigenstate @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the limit @xmath71 ,",
    "if we only keep the leading order expansion on @xmath72 , we will find that @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "thus there is an additional piece for @xmath77 coming from @xmath78 with a factor @xmath79 .",
    "however , we can find that this part is separated from the previous one , and the @xmath12 part in the @xmath78 will cancel if we observe the full theory .",
    "we do not show this here in detail .",
    "the second model b has a physical higgs field which is the diagonal part of the link field @xmath80 that contributes to scattering @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding moose diagram is presented in fig [ fig : mooseb ] .",
    "we choose @xmath81 large so that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are decoupled from the low energy effective theory except for a wess - zumino - witten term that cancels the gauge anomaly .",
    "the fermions we observe are @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "they have a yukawa interaction @xmath86 which gives them a dirac mass @xmath87 and the corresponding couplings to the massive gauge boson @xmath2 are @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "unitarity in @xmath13 is recovered from the s - channel @xmath80 exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ feydiagab ] ( h ) ) if the sgsb sector is linearly realized .",
    "another possibility is that the sgsb is triggered by a strongly coupled dynamics ( for instance , fermion pair condensation ) and the unitarity bound suggests the energy scale in which the theory becomes strongly coupled . in both cases of model b , the physics is very similar to the one in the scattering @xmath90 in the sm .",
    "let s take the model a , and assume that we fail to observe the massive fermion @xmath91 and its interactions and gauge invariance is violated explicitly .",
    "we can see this from the fact that the goldstone equivalence theorem does nt apply here because the goldstone @xmath92 eaten by @xmath2 does not couple to fermion @xmath4 ( the link field @xmath32 does nt couple to @xmath4 ) , which tells us that the nonzero result @xmath13 in the incomplete theory ( without @xmath93 ) is different from @xmath94 which is zero shows that goldstone equivalence theorem is also violated in this case . ] .",
    "such a violation of the goldstone equivalence theorem is a direct way to see how the ward identity of the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry is violated . in general , cutting the theory on certain towers of gauge bosons and fermions will make the mass eigenstate basis incomplete and gauge invariance requires the completeness of such a basis orbifold , 5d gauge invariance is proved from the 4d point of view by using the fact that the 4d fermion basis is complete in ref . @xcite . ] .",
    "when we fail to observe some massive particles ( like the @xmath93 in our case ) , we will always find a non - unitary mixing matrix for the light fields at low energy which is a part of a larger unitary mixing matrix ( like the unitary mixing matrix in eq .",
    "( [ f_mg ] ) and ( [ f_gm ] ) of model a ) , which involves the missing heavy particles . in model b",
    ", we fail to observe the physical higgs that is responsible for the @xmath95 mass generation . in this case",
    ", the mass of @xmath95 comes purely from the sgsb sector that gives @xmath2 mass and goldstone equivalence theorem does apply . in general ,",
    "part of the @xmath95 mass generation may come from the same sgsb sector that gives @xmath2 mass .",
    "both the massive fermions and physical higgs in the linearly realized moose will contribute to the scattering @xmath96 . because we still fail to observe the massive fermions which would form a complete mass eigenstate basis of fermions , gauge invariance and the ward identity of the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry are still violated and we ca nt apply the goldstone equivalence theorem .    in the sm , unitarity bounds from fermion - antifermion - pair scattering into pairs of longitudinally polarized electroweak gauge bosons are interpreted as the scale of fermion mass generation@xcite .",
    "the scattering @xmath97 process is also considered in the deconstructed higgsless model@xcite . in those cases , both the fermions and massive gauge bosons in the scattering gain their mass through electroweak symmetry breaking . in the case",
    "that fermions and massive gauge bosons gain their mass through different spontaneous symmetry breaking sectors , for instance the model a , we can see that the unitarity bounds are no longer related to the scale of @xmath4 mass generation . instead , it is the energy scale of @xmath93 mass at which @xmath93 maintains the unitarity in the scattering @xmath13 at high energy .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the sm , if we did find the higgs but missed the top quark , the unitarity bound from @xmath98 would have put an upper scale on the top quark mass .    in ref.@xcite,@xcite ,",
    "the bound is generalized to a @xmath99 inelastic scattering in the sm , which gives a much stronger bound for light fermions .",
    "the calculation is based on the goldstone equivalence theorem . in general",
    ", the goldstone equivalence theorem may not apply in our case because gauge symmetry is violated if we fail to observe some parts of the underlying theory ( for instance in model a ) .",

    "typical examples of the @xmath4 are the top quark or the new quarks which decay through a @xmath127 boson into sm quarks ( @xmath129 quarks ) . knowing the relative ratio of the @xmath2 decaying into different chiralities of @xmath4 , which is @xmath130 , and the overall decay width of @xmath131 , which is proportional to @xmath132 , we can calculate the axial coupling @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite offers a _ direct _ way to check the nonzero axial coupling at lhc which indicates that the tree level unitarity is violated from scattering @xmath133 .    measuring the polarization of @xmath4",
    "requires reconstructing the @xmath4 rest frame from observables in the event , which makes it very difficult to measure the axial coupling in models with discrete parity that lead to missing energy .",
    "the reason is that the pair produced @xmath4 fermions will further decay into some lightest neutral stable particles , and the missing energy from two such lightest neutral stable particles makes it very difficult to reconstruct the @xmath4 rest frame . here are two examples : in little higgs with t - parity@xcite , the t - odd @xmath2 will decay into a t - odd fermion and a t - even fermion .",
