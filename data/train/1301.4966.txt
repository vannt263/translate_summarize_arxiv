    "our model does not account for coriolis - type angular couplings , i.e. , the couplings of the @xmath99 states with @xmath100 states because their effect on the rovibrational dynamics is negligible compared to the spin - orbit couplings , the error of the electronic structure data and the influence of the weak non - resonant field .",
    "it is not surprising due to large reduced mass of rb@xmath0 molecules whose inverse enters all coupling matrix elements .    when the electric field is switched on , the @xmath101 and @xmath102 components of the b@xmath6 state are coupled .",

    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "weakly bound levels have most of their amplitude at internuclear separations larger than @xmath277a@xmath278 .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is strong at large internuclear separations and smaller at intermediate separations , while the opposite is true for the polarizability components .",
    "a large dependence of the singlet - triplet character on the non - resonant field intensity is expected when the interaction energy with the field and the spin - orbit coupling become comparable . due to the @xmath21-dependence of the polarizability , for weakly bound levels this requires field intensities in excess of @xmath279w/@xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the more deeply bound levels , @xmath275 , have their outer turning point near @xmath280 where the polarizability is large and the spin - orbit coupling is small .",
    "therefore , intensities of the order of @xmath281w/@xmath8 yield an interaction energy with the field that is comparable to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for example , for @xmath282w/@xmath8 , the stark shift of the levels amounts to about 15@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "their vibrational spacing , of the order of 20@xmath2@xmath3 , is also comparable .",
    "the interaction with the non - resonant field will then affect the singlet - triplet character of a rovibrational wavefunction , provided the @xmath21-dependence of polarizabilities differs for singlet and triplet states .",
    "this is indeed the case , cf .",
    "[ fig9 ] , explaining the changes in the singlet - triplet decomposition observed in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "in the present work we have investigated how the spectroscopy of the rb@xmath0 molecule is affected by applying a non - resonant field .",
    "our emphasis has been on the manifold of the spin - orbit coupled a@xmath5 and b@xmath6 excited states . to this end",
    "we have derived the electronic hamiltonian describing the interaction of a diatomic molecule with a non - resonant field in general and the hamiltonian describing the nuclear motion in a non - resonant field for the manifold of the coupled a@xmath5 and b@xmath6 excited electronic states in particular .",
    "we have employed the double electron attachment intermediate hamiltonian fock space coupled cluster method restricted to single and double excitations for all electronic states of the rb@xmath0 molecule up to the @xmath1 dissociation limit of about 26.000@xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the agreement between the present results and those fitted to high resolution spectroscopic data is very good , both for the well depths and the vibrational frequencies .",
    "the accuracy of the present results for the potential energy curves is much higher than the previous electronic structure calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite and slightly better than in the most recent study by allouche and aubert - frcon @xcite .    in order to correctly predict the spectroscopic behavior ,",
    "we have also calculated the electric transition dipole moments , non - adiabatic coupling and spin - orbit coupling matrix elements , and static dipole polarizabilities of rb@xmath0 , using the multireference configuration interaction method . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "we have reported in this paper the very first calculation of the irreducible components of the polarizability tensor as a function of @xmath21 for electronically excited states . for the spin - orbit",
    "coupled manifold of the a@xmath5 and b@xmath6 excited states , we have checked the accuracy of the _ ab initio _ results with the spectroscopic data .",
    "very good agreement was found .",
    "we have investigated the spectroscopy of rb@xmath0 in its rovibronic ground state , corresponding to a molecular beam experiment , as well as in highly excited vibrational levels of ground and electronically excited states , typical for photoassociation experiments at ultracold temperatures . in both cases ,",
    "the spectroscopy is significantly altered by a non - resonant field .",
    "specifically , fields of the order of @xmath283w/@xmath8 are found to split a single rovibrational line into several ones and shift the lines by a few @xmath3 .",
    "the splitting is due to rotational hybridization , i.e. , the field - dressed wavefunctions are made up of several field - free partial waves with comparable contributions . for strong non - resonant fields , of the order of @xmath282w/@xmath8",
    ", alignment leads to an increase of the transition strengths compared to the field - free case , due to localization of the rotational wavefunctions in regions close to @xmath284 and @xmath268 , and the dependence of the transition matrix elements on @xmath269  @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a non - resonant field on the transition matrix elements that govern stabilization by spontaneous emission for photoassociated molecules  @xcite .",
    "similarly to strontium molecules  @xcite , transitions occur to the same vibrational levels as in the field - free case .",
    "this implies that a non - resonant field may be used to enhance the photoassociation rate  @xcite without deteriorating stabilization of the photoassociated molecules into bound levels of the electronic ground state .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we have found a non - resonant field to significantly modify the singlet - triplet character of rovibrational levels in the a@xmath5 and b@xmath6 excited state manifold for levels in the middle of the potential wells , while weakly bound levels remain rather unaffected .",
    "we have identified two conditions for a modification of the singlet - triplet character  the interaction energy with the field needs to be comparable to the spin - orbit coupling and the dependence of the polarizability tensor components on the interatomic separation must differ for singlet and triplet molecules .",
    "if both conditions are fulfilled , as was found to be the case for rb@xmath0 levels of the a@xmath5 and b@xmath6 manifold with vibrational quantum number around 55 , the singlet or triplet character of a rovibrational wavefunction can be controlled by a non - resonant field .",
    "an interesting perspective for coherent control arises when applying a non - resonant field to degenerate excited electronic states .",
    "we have shown that , for degenerate states , a non - resonant field introduces a coupling between different states , @xmath285 and @xmath286 in the present example . in coherent control based on wavepacket motion ,",
    "such a coupling between different states can be used to shape the effective potential energy curve governing the wavepacket dynamics  @xcite . using a non - resonant field , for example in the far infrared ,",
    "comes with the advantage of small losses even for strong fields .",
    "non - resonant field control of photoassociation rates  @xcite or wavepacket dynamics based on field - induced resonant coupling  @xcite represents a new twist to manipulating molecules with non - resonant fields  @xcite .",
