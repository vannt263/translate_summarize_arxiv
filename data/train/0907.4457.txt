    "the phenix experiment at rhic is designed for high rate measurement of electromagnetic probes , specifically direct photons @xmath3 and neutral pions @xmath4 at mid - rapidity ( @xmath50.35 ) .",
    "the high event rate allows unique access to rare probes , such as particles produced at very high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "early results for the nuclear modification factors r@xmath6 , the spectrum in au+au collisions over the spectrum in p+p interactions scaled by the respective nucleon overlap integrals , showed suppression of @xmath4 and charged hadron production at high-@xmath7 ( @xmath86gev / c ) @xcite .",
    "this result , combined with the apparent lack of suppression for high-@xmath0 direct @xmath3 production @xcite has been interpreted as an indication of the formation of a dense strongly interacting medium , the sqgp , in heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the preliminary analysis of the high statistics 2004 au+au run showed a possible decrease of direct photon r@xmath6 above 14gev / c of transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for this observation include the isospin effect ( the difference of partonic content between protons and neutrons ) , the emc effect ( modifications of the distribution of partons in the heavy nuclei ) , and the suppression of the direct photons originating from fragmenting partons which are quenched by the medium .",
    "rhic measurements of particle production in d+au collisions from 2003 show no suppression of produced particles within large experimental error bars @xcite , indicating little or no modification of the initial state in gold nuclei .",
    "this result confirmed the attribution of the large suppression observed in central au+au interactions to final state effects in the sqgp medium .    the final analysis of the 2003 data set revealed some suppression of @xmath4 production at the highest @xmath0 in the most central d+au interactions @xcite",
    ", however the experimental uncertainties are too large to estimate cold nuclear matter effects quantitatively @xcite .",
    "the rhic run in year 2008 improved the total integrated luminosity of the d+au sample by a factor of @xmath930 compared to the 2003 run : 1.65@xmath1010@xmath11 minimum bias ( mb ) events , and 3.68@xmath1010@xmath11 events from a high-@xmath7 photon ( ert ) trigger were recorded .",
    "there were also 0.53@xmath1010@xmath11 mb triggered and 1.17@xmath1010@xmath11 ert triggered p+p collisions taken in 2008 .",
    "the uncorrected @xmath4 yields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi0 ] .    the improvement in total d+au integrated luminosity can be appreciated from the relative statistical errors in the @xmath4 measurement using phenix pbsc emcal .",
    "the error at @xmath1215gev / c is 32% using the 2003 sample , and is reduced to 3.5% in the recent high statistics run .",
    "production from the 2008 data sets : p+p minbias , d+au minbias , and three centrality bins in d+au collisions using phenix pbsc emcal .",
    "the spectra from ert triggered runs ( red ) are scaled to match mb yields ( blue ) in 613 gev / c region of @xmath7 .",
    "only statistical errors are shown.,scaledwidth=105.0% ]",
    "previous results from data taken in year 2003 indicate that the high @xmath7 suppression observed in au+au interactions is a final state effect since the r@xmath1 ratios are consistent with unity , albeit within large experimental errors .",
    "it is important to test this conclusion to higher precision .",
    "recent d+au data taken in 2008 improve the integrated luminosity by about a factor of thirty compared to the 2003 run .",
    "the 2008 phenix measurement will shed more light on the origin of cold nuclear matter effects .",
