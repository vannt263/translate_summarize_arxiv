    "observations of the polarization of mean pulse profiles have given much information about the pulsar radio emission mechanism .",
    "pulsars often have very high linear polarization and the sweep of position angle across the pulse is generally well described by the rotating - vector model @xcite .",
    "this and the bilateral symmetry of many pulse profiles led to a model in which the emission is beamed into a hollow cone centered on the magnetic axis . with observations of an increasing number of pulsars it soon became clear that the mean pulse profiles of many pulsars were more complex .",
    "the frequent occurence of a central emission peak @xcite led to the idea of a ` core ' component in contrast to the outer ` conal ' components .",
    "further observations showed that many pulsars had multiple conal components leading to ideas of multiple cones @xcite or patchy beams @xcite .",
    "core emission tends to have a steeper spectrum than conal emission and a higher degree of circular polarization , often with a reversal of sense near the profile center @xcite , although reversing circular polarization is sometimes observed in conal emission @xcite .",
    "the apparent width of both core and conal beams is a function of pulse period ( @xmath1 ) , with an approximate @xmath2 dependence @xcite .    with the discovery of millisecond pulsars ( msps )",
    ", the parameter ranges available for study of pulse emission processes was greatly extended .",
    "msps have much weaker surface magnetic fields than ` normal ' pulsars , with @xmath3 typically a few by @xmath4  g , compared to @xmath5  g for normal pulsars . they also have much smaller magnetospheres , conventionally defined to be limited by the light cylinder at radius @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the pulsar period and @xmath7 is the velocity of light . for the fastest msp , psr b1937 + 21 , @xmath8 is only 74 km , or about ten times the neutron star radius . one",
    "would therefore expect the radio emission from msps to be rather different to that from normal pulsars .",
    "msp pulse profiles are generally wider ( in pulse phase ) than those of normal pulsars , which is not surprising in view of the wider angle subtended by the ` open ' field lines which penetrate the light cylinder and define the extent of the polar cap .",
    "also , msp profiles have different frequency evolution characteristics compared to most normal pulsars .",
    "in particular , the component separations are largely independent of frequency @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that the distinctions and relationships between ` core ' and ` conal ' emission seen in longer - period pulsars apply to msps .",
    "for example , the strong component in psr j0437@xmath04715 is clearly central to the emission beam but has a flatter spectrum than the outer components @xcite .    despite these differences ,",
    "there are many similarities in the radio emission properties of msps and normal pulsars .",
    "if the greater width of msp profiles is ignored , the shapes of msp mean pulse profiles are very similar to those of normal pulsars . however , among the msps , there is a greater proportion of ` interpulse ' profiles , with two main regions of pulse emission separated by approximately @xmath9 of pulse phase or longitude .",
    "msp profiles often appear to have more components than normal pulsars , but kramer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have argued that this is simply because msp components are more obvious because of their wider spacing . on average ,",
    "the radio emission of msps has a spectral index which is only marginally steeper than that of normal pulsars and may in fact be the same @xcite .",
    "msps are typically somewhat less luminous than normal pulsars but there is a large overlap in the luminosity distributions . finally , the polarization properties of msps and normal pulsars are remarkably similar , with both often having high fractional linear polarization and generally smaller levels of circular polarization .",
    "orthogonal jumps in position angle are seen in both classes of pulsar ( e.g. stinebring et al .",
    "1984 ; thorsett & stinebring 1990 ) . variations of position angle ( pa ) through msp profiles are often more complex than is typical for normal pulsars . despite this , in many cases the pa",
    "can be approximately fitted by the simple rotating vector model ( rvm ) which applies to most normal pulsars , at least once orthogonal jumps are taken into account ( e.g. arzoumanian et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these similarities leave little doubt that the basic radio emission mechanism is the same in normal pulsars and msps .",
    "extensive studies of the polarization properties of msps have previously been made by thorsett & stinebring ( 1990 ) : psrs b1937 + 21 , b1953 + 29 and b1957 + 20 at several frequencies between 430 and 2830 mhz ; navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : psr j0437@xmath04715 at 438 , 660 and 1512 mhz ; arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : psr b1534 + 12 at 430 mhz ; xilouris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : 24 pulsars at 1410 mhz ; stairs , thorsett & camilo ( 1999 ) : 19 pulsars at 410 , 610 and/or 1414 mhz ; and lommen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : psr j0030 + 0451 at 430 mhz .",
    "all observations except those of psr j0437@xmath04715 by navarro et al . were made using northern hemisphere telescopes , so there is little information on the polarization of the southern msps .",
    "also , there are significant discrepancies in the results of different groups for some pulsars .",
    "for example , results from xilouris et al . ( 1998 ) and stairs et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for psrs j1022 + 1001 , j1713 + 0747 and j2145 - 0750 at frequencies near 1400 mhz differ substantially .",
    "it is important to understand whether these differences are due to time variations such as mode changing @xcite or problems with data processing and/or calibration .",
    "furthermore , in some previous studies ( e.g. stairs et al . 1999 ) the position angle scale is not absolute .",
    "absolute position angles are important for faraday rotation studies and in comparisons with other properties .",
    "important examples are the comparison of the pulsar rotation axis direction implied by radio polarization measurements with that deduced from x - ray observations and with the direction of the pulsar proper motion . @xcite .    with their high linear polarization",
    ", it is relatively easy to determine rotation measures ( rms ) for most pulsars .",
    "combined with the dispersion measure ( dm ) , pulsars give a direct measure of the mean line - of - sight magnetic field between the sun and the pulsar , weighted by the local electron density .",
    "since the dm also provides an estimate of the pulsar distance , pulsars are a valuable probe of the galactic magnetic field ( e.g. han et al . 2002 ) .",
    "most msps are relatively close to the sun , so they provide information on conditions in the local region of the galaxy .",
    "we have used the parkes 64-m telescope of the australia telescope national facility and the caltech pulsar correlator to make observations of nine southern msps at 20  cm and , for three of these , at 50  cm .",
    "five of these pulsars have no previously published polarization observations and none have previously published rotation measures .",
    "details of the observing system and observational parameters are given in   2 .",
    "the polarization and rm results are presented in   3 and   4 respectively , and in   5 we discuss some implications of our polarization measurements .",
    "observations were made in three sessions , 1996 august 31  september 5 , 1999 december 12  17 , and 2000 december 14  19 using the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "the 20-cm observations were made using the central beam of the parkes multibeam receiver @xcite in the 1999 and 2000 sessions with a central frequency of 1318.5 mhz .",
    "this system has cryogenically cooled preamplifiers , giving a system temperature of about 21  k or about 29 jy , and orthogonal linear feeds with a calibration signal injected at angle of @xmath10 to the feed probes . because this system has significant cross - coupling between the feed probes , all observations were made at two feed angles at @xmath11 .",
    "these measurements were summed after compensation for the feed rotation , thereby eliminating most of the effects of feed cross - coupling .",
    "the 50-cm observations had a central frequency of 660 mhz and were were made in the 1996 and 2000 sessions using a receiver with cryogenically cooled preamplifiers and a cavity - backed disk feed , again with a calibration signal injected at 45 .",
    "observations with this system were made at fixed feed angle ; in this case the feed cross - coupling is small and did not significantly affect the polarization results .",
    "the flux scale was established using observations of hydra a , assumed to have flux densities of 85 and 45 jy at 660 and 1320 mhz , respectively .    the caltech correlator system @xcite was used to form the polarization products and to bin the signals synchronously with the pulsar period . for both 660 and 1320 mhz , the signals were up - converted to 1580 mhz , band - limited to 32 or 128 mhz respectively and power levels adjusted for 2-bit digitization at 256 mhz .",
    "the correlator gives 128 lags in each of four polarization channels and folds the data synchronously with the pulsar period with 1024 bins per period .",
    "after on - line folding , typically for 90 seconds , the 512 sub - integration profiles were transferred to a workstation for further processing .",
    "data in each phase bin were transformed to the frequency domain and narrow - band interference rejected . using a pulsed calibration observation made immediately before each pulsar observation ,",
    "the data were corrected for differential delays between the two polarization channels and calibrated into mjy units .",
    "after conversion to stokes parameters , the data were corrected for parallactic angle rotation and ionospheric faraday rotation and dedispersed to form 16 to 64 frequency sub - bands , depending on the pulsar dm .    in off - line analysis",
    ", the orthogonal observation pairs for 1320 mhz were summed and the data were summed in time to form stokes - parameter profiles for each sub - band . in most cases several observation pairs were summed to form the final profiles .",
    "because of low system gain , some sub - bands at one or both ends of the bandpass were normally rejected , changing the effective center frequency .",
    "we then summed the data in frequency for a range of trial rms , ( normally in a range of @xmath121500 rad  m@xmath13 with a step of 25 rad  m@xmath13 ) to search for a peak in the linearly polarized intensity @xmath14 .",
    "stokes parameter profiles were then formed for the upper and lower halves of the bandpass , correcting for the approximate rm determined in the previous stage of analysis .",
    "the best estimate of pulsar rm was then obtained by taking weighted means of position - angle ( pa ) differences for bins where the uncertainty in the pa difference was less than @xmath15 .",
    "finally , a single set of stokes - parameter profiles was formed for each observation .",
    "table  [ tb : obspar ] lists the basic observational parameters for the nine observed msps .",
    "columns are , in order : pulsar name based on j2000 coordinates , pulse period , dm , year(s ) in which the observations were made , effective center frequency and bandwidth after sub - band rejection , number of bins across the pulse period and the total observation time .    [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     two of these pulsars , j0711@xmath06830 and j1643@xmath01224 , have surprisingly large values of @xmath16 , especially psr j1643@xmath01224 given its relatively large distance . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath16 values are larger than for other pulsars located close to them on the sky @xcite .",
    "these results will be further discussed in a forthcoming paper in the context of a large sample of pulsar rms .",
    "in this paper we have presented pulse profiles and polarization parameters for nine southern msps , five of which had no previously published polarization data .",
    "new rm values are given for all nine pulsars .",
    "notable results include the very high fractional circular polarization ( @xmath17% at 1327 mhz ) in the trailing component of psr j1603@xmath07202 , and the extremely wide and complex pulse profile and polarization properties of psr j2124@xmath03358 . @xcite",
    "have argued that , on average , msps have profiles which are of similar complexity ( quantified by the number of recognizable components ) to those of normal pulsars .",
    "however , there is a tail to the distribution in msps exemplified by psr j0473@xmath04715 @xcite , which has at least 10 components , and psr j2124@xmath03358 ( figure  [ fg:2124 ] ; at least 12 components ) which is not present in normal pulsars ; no normal pulsars have profiles as complex as these , even in data with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "while many msp profiles have the appearance of ` stretched ' normal pulsar profiles , there are significant differences .",
    "one of the most important is the lack of frequency evolution in the spacing of pulse components @xcite . in most normal pulsars ,",
    "the pulse components are more widely separated at lower radio frequencies , an observation often interpreted in terms of ` radius - to - frequency mapping ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented here confirm this lack of frequency evolution in msp profiles .",
    "for example , figure  [ fg:2124_alpha ] shows that for psr j2124@xmath03358 , although components are mostly overlapping , there is a clear correspondence of component locations at the two frequencies right across the profile .",
    "it is important to note however that this property is shared by normal pulsars with so - called ` interpulse ' emission , including such well - known examples as the crab pulsar @xcite and psr b0950 + 08 @xcite , suggesting a close link between the emission processes in msps and ` normal ' interpulse pulsars .",
    "most msp profiles do not fit easily into the ` core - cone ' classification scheme @xcite or its extensions to multiple cones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even when the profile has a shape similar to a classical ` triple ' , for example psr j2145@xmath00750 ( figure  [ fg:2145 ] ) , the spectral properties of the central and outer components do not follow the patterns established for normal pulsars . for psr j2124@xmath03358",
    "there is no identifiable ` core ' component and there is no pattern suggesting multiple nested conal emission .",
    "while there do appear to be discrete quasi - gaussian components within the observed profile , a very large number of them would be required to model it and their amplitude and phase ( longitude ) shows no clear pattern .",
    "rather , the profile seems more consistent with a random distribution of emission patches as advocated by @xcite .",
    "the spectral index variations shown in figure  [ fg:2124_alpha ] are consistent with different pulse components originating in spatially distinct emission regions",
    ".    the wide observed profiles of msps give a good opportunity to fit the rvm and hence to determine both the magnetic inclination @xmath18 and the line - of - sight inclination @xmath19 .",
    "most normal pulsars have narrow profiles and only the impact parameter @xmath20 can be measured ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some msps",
    ", the observed pa variations follow the rvm quite well , especially at higher frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in others , there are clear and sometimes large deviations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two pulsars in the present sample , psrs j2124@xmath03358 and 2145@xmath00750 , have sufficiently wide profiles to justify an attempt to fit the rvm .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fg : pafits ] .",
    "while the overall pa variation for psr j2124@xmath03358 is approximately described by the rvm fit , it is clear that there are large and systematic deviations from the model fit",
    ". the parameters of this fit are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , suggesting that emission is seen from both poles with impact parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "however , there is a large covariance between @xmath18 and @xmath19 with only a small increase in @xmath25 for @xmath18 values between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . at these limits ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath19 values are @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively . for small @xmath18",
    ", a one - pole interpretation is favoured .",
    "given the poor quality of the fit , it is not at all clear what the true inclination angles for the two axes are .",
    "certainly , the fact that emission is seen over most if not all of the pulse period suggests a one - pole , almost aligned model .    for psr j2145@xmath00750 ,",
    "if we assume there is an orthogonal flip near longitude @xmath30 but not at @xmath31 , we get the fit shown in figure  [ fg : pafits ]",
    ". this has @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "again , there are systematic deviations from the fit and a large covariance between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but the impact parameter @xmath34 is relatively well determined .",
    "this pa fit , the sense reversal of the circular polarization and the spectral behaviour all suggest that , despite the profile morphology , the trailing component is in fact central to the emission beam ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume a second orthogonal jump at @xmath31 the impact parameter increases to about @xmath35 . however , this introduces a significant discontinuity in pa at this longitude , suggesting that this is not the correct interpretation .",
    "if we accept that the trailing component is in fact central to the emission beam , the interpretation of the weak leading component becomes something of a problem .",
    "@xcite suggest that it is a ` precursor ' , analogous to that in the crab pulsar .",
    "this is supported by its nearly 100% linear polarization .",
    "the emission bridge between the leading and strongest components suggests that all components are closely related and probably that all the emission orginates from one pole .",
    "this implies a very large effective pulse width , @xmath36 . for small @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the true beam radius ( cf",
    "* ) , giving @xmath40 .",
    "this compares with a predicted value of @xmath41 from the relation @xmath42 @xcite .    for other pulsars in the sample , and indeed for most msps @xcite",
    ", there is very little swing in pa across the the observed pulse components .",
    "taken at face value , this implies large impact parameters and/or very small magnetic inclinations . yet",
    "many of these pulsars have relatively narrow pulses , e.g. psrs j0621 + 1002 , j1518 + 4904 and j1713 + 0747 @xcite .",
    "this implies a beam radius in the longitude direction much less than the apparent impact parameter , that is , a beam effectively elongated in the latitude direction ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) . if these pulse components are part of a wide beam from magnetic field lines associated with one pole , as suggested for young ` interpulse ' pulsars by @xcite , intermediate magnetic inclinations and large impact parameters are possible . in this case",
    ", the implied emission altitudes relative to the light cylinder are much higher than those implied by observed pulse widths for normal pulsars . at these altitudes",
    ", there will be significant deviations of the magnetic field from a pure dipole form due to displacement and physical currents , providing a possible reason for the observed large pa deviations from rvm fits seen in millisecond pulsars .",
    "it is also possible that these irregular pa variations result from very different magnetic field structures in msps .",
    "for example , @xcite suggests that , during the spindown and subsequent recycling process , crustal plate movements result in highly distorted field structures .",
    "accretion - induced field decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would also result in highly non - dipolar fields .",
    "such field structures could also disguise or destroy the relatively consistent patterns of core and conal emission seen in most longer - period pulsars .",
    "in general , our polarization results agree well with those of @xcite when account is taken of the reversed pa convention in that paper .",
    "however , there are many discrepancies with results in the @xcite paper .",
    "it appears that their sign of stokes @xmath43 is systematically reversed .",
    "it is also probable that the higher and approximately constant fractional linear polarization with nearly constant pa seen in a number of their figures results from errors in calibration rather than time variations in the polarization properties ( cf . * ? ? ?",
