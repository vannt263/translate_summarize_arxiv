    "interlayer binding of graphenic structures such as bigraphene and graphite is very challenging to evaluate in _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "standard approaches like the local density@xcite and generalized gradient@xcite approximations ( lda and gga ) , and van der waals ( vdw ) density functional theories ( vdw dfts eg .",
    "vdw - df@xcite , ts - approach@xcite , dft - d*@xcite and vv10@xcite ; see ref .   for an overview ) either miss ( lda / gga ) or mispredict@xcite ( vdw dft ) the dispersive binding , especially in the asymptotic limit .",
    "this failure is in part due to the presence@xcite of coupled long - wavelength charge fluctuations , which influence the dispersion interactions between graphene layers@xcite , and which are difficult to predict via conventional means .",
    "the random - phase approximation to the adiabatic connection , fluctuation - dissipation functional approach@xcite ( acfd - rpa or rpa ) seamlessly predicts the dispersive binding of graphite@xcite .",
    "the direct rpa includes all plasmon interactions , and is known@xcite to accurately predict the binding properties of a wide variety of systems",
    ". however rpa is computationally difficult to evaluate for graphenic materials , requiring substantial computer resources even for the relatively simple case of bulk graphite@xcite .",
    "for example the rpa binding energy of bigraphene and exfoliation energy of graphite ( the energy required to remove a single layer from the surface of bulk graphite ) are difficult to evaluate with present computational resources , although sophisticated attempts@xcite have been made to predict both through rescaled dispersion corrections .    a simple way to deal with dispersion is to use efficient dispersion - free calculations ( lda / gga ) and simply add a model potential accounting for the difficult vdw properties .",
    "such an approach is similar to the popular dft - d*@xcite and tkatchenko - scheffler ( ts)@xcite vdw approximations .",
    "previously there have been many attempts@xcite to develop semiempirical model potentials using the known properties of bulk graphite . until recently , however , reasonable values of certain material properties like the interlayer binding energy [ @xmath7 normalised per atom or by area where @xmath8 is the energy of bulk graphite with intra - layer atomic coordinates fixed and all graphene layers a distance @xmath1 from their nearest neighbours ] and the inelastic interlayer coefficient [ @xmath9 were not available . additionally , many early attempts did not include the unusual van der waals properties@xcite of graphenic structures , and thus incorrectly reproduced the intermediate- and long - distance binding .",
    "in this work we will use the latest theoretical results , and _ ab initio _ data from accurate acfd - rpa calculations to develop a model potential for graphite .",
    "the model will be simple to evaluate and to use . to ensure physical realism",
    "we shall ensure that the model satisfies many constraints , namely the first three energy derivatives at the optimal lattice spacing , and the vdw dispersion potential away from contact .",
    "the model can be used on its own in force field modelling , or to supplement lda and gga calculations , with the lda recommended over the gga due to its better predictive power .",
    "the model potential will then be extended to the cases of bigraphene and graphite exfoliation , and used to predict the important binding and exfoliation energies , and other properties . finally the model potential will be tested on lithium intercalated graphite ( lic@xmath2 ) .",
    "we shall show that the model gives reasonable results for all cases , and should thus be employable on a wide range of graphenic systems .",
    "in this paper we compare a number of different graphitic systems .",
    "special care must be taken when considering energy properties , as these can become ambiguous when comparing between different geometrical arrangements .",
    "these issues are discussed as they arise in the text , but we raise some here to help avoid confusion .    where direct comparisons are made between different geometries ( such as in table  [ tab : graph ] ) we use jm@xmath4  which is the energy divided by the surface area of a single layer for bigraphene and graphite exfoliation , and the energy divided by the surface area divided by the number of layers for the bulk systems graphite and lithium intercalated graphite .",
    "the elastic coefficient @xmath10 is defined in the standard way for graphite and lic@xmath2 . for bigraphene and exfoliation",
    "there is no natural way to define @xmath10 and we define it via the second derivative , with respect to the outermost layer spacing , of the energy per area , scaled appropriately to allow comparison with bulk graphite .",
    "we also give results in mev / atom as this is a natural unit for bulk systems , especially for _ ab initio _ studies .",
    "here we take the total energy of a cell divided by the number of _ carbon _ atoms in the cell .",
    "the one exception is in the exfoliation calculations , where we consider only the atoms in the two layers forming the opened surface ( four atoms for the standard ab cell used here ) . for carbon atoms with in - plane c - c bond length",
    "@xmath11 given in angstrom we convert energy @xmath12 from mev / atom to jm@xmath4  via @xmath13=s\\epsilon[\\text{mev / atom}]$ ] where @xmath14 for the bulks and @xmath15 for the layer pairs .",
    "key to previous models of graphene binding are three material properties : the lattice constant @xmath16 of ab graphite ( or interlayer distance @xmath17 where @xmath18 ) , the inter - planar elastic coefficient @xmath10 , and the binding energy @xmath19 .",
    "these are listed in order of experimental inconsistency , with the binding energy showing the greatest variation across different experiments .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath16 has been found@xcite very accurately to be @xmath20  corresponding to an inter - layer distance @xmath21 , while the elastic coefficient has been narrowed down by experiment@xcite to a small range @xmath22gpa",
    ". the binding energy has never been directly measured , and most efforts@xcite to determine it involve unreliable theoretical models ] of dispersion to reverse engineer the binding energy from other properties .",
    "estimates range between about @xmath23mev / atom@xmath24jm@xmath4/layer   to @xmath25mev / atom@xmath26jm@xmath4/layer . until recently",
    ", theory has fared little better than experiment at prediciting @xmath19 . here",
    "the gga predicts a binding energy of @xmath27mev / atom@xcite , the lda predicts @xmath28mev / atom@xcite , and different vdw corrected dft approaches@xcite predict@xcite values between @xmath28 ( layer vdw - df@xcite ) and @xmath29mev / atom ( vv10@xcite ) .",
    "the authors _ _ et al.__@xcite previously published accurate rpa calculations for graphite .",
    "the rpa is known@xcite to be very good at predicting many properties of bulk systems , and in the absence of conclusive experiments we consider it to be a benchmark for graphite energy differences . in those calculations ,",
    "the binding energy was found to be @xmath30mev / atom@xmath31jm@xmath4/layer , comparable to @xmath32mev / atom found through high - level quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations@xcite . unlike qmc",
    ", rpa also gave a lattice distance @xmath21  and an elastic constant @xmath33gpa , in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "for this work , additional rpa calculations were performed using the same parameters as ref .   at additional inter - layer distances @xmath1 . using the extra points we can now calculate the inelastic constant @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is defined via @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the normalised force per unit area required to distort graphite in the inter - planar direction @xmath38 ) so that @xmath39 here @xmath17 is the equilibrium lattice distance",
    ", @xmath40 is the equilibrium volume of the unit cell and @xmath41 is the energy of the graphene unit cell with lattice parameters @xmath42 and @xmath18 . for reference",
    "we note that ab graphite has an optimal unit cell defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath11 is the c - c distance in the plane @xmath46  so that the unit cell has volume @xmath47 .    from the rpa data we thus have four , well - converged constraints on any model function of graphite : the inter - layer distance @xmath17 , the binding energy @xmath19 , and the elastic and inelastic constants @xmath10 and @xmath35 . a model which reproduces all four",
    "should be expected to reproduce the near - contact behaviour of graphite , at least at the rpa level .",
    "in addition to the near - contact behaviour , we also seek a model which can reproduce the asymptotic dispersion properties .",
    "dispersion in graphite is comprised of two major contributions : i ) ` unusual ' coupled - fluctuation graphenic interactions from the gapless transitions between @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals ; and ii ) ` usual ' insulating van der waals interactions arising from all other transitions .",
    "the former have been previously@xcite shown to give rise to a potential with the asymptotic form @xmath50 .",
    "the authors more recently showed@xcite that this form is only valid at quite large distances , with @xmath51 being more valid at intermediate values .",
    "the latter give rise to a potential with the conventional ` planar ' formula @xmath52 , whose form is consistent with sums over the layers of inter - atomic interactions @xmath53 .",
    "there is evidence@xcite that even here the conventional summing technique is problematic .",
    "we avoid any non - additivity issues by fitting to the geometry dependent rpa results and bypassing less reliable sums over atoms .    to leading orders in @xmath54 , the dispersion energy per carbon atom",
    "can thus be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 accounts for higher order corrections .",
    "here @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are determined by the properties of graphite s dirac cones , but we must determine @xmath60 and @xmath56 via best fits to _ ab initio _ acfd - rpa energies .    ]    the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend on an assumed cutoff energy for interactions between the @xmath48 and @xmath49 dirac cones , as well as the fermi velocity . using the lda fermi velocity of @xmath61kms@xmath62 , and assuming a physically plausible energy cutoff of @xmath63ev gives@xcite @xmath64 , @xmath65  and @xmath66 , and we use these parameters henceforth .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : evdw ] we find @xmath69  and @xmath70ev@xmath71 give a good fit to the rpa correlation energy across @xmath72 . for convenience ,",
    "all best - fit parameters including these are presented in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "hasegawa and nishidate@xcite ( hn ) suggested that a model of graphite interactions could be developed around the assumption that standard groundstate dft ( lda / gga ) is valid in the inner @xmath73 region , while the dispersion potential dominates for @xmath74 , and thus a fit between these two functions would be appropriate for the total energy .",
    "it is in this spirit that we develop our model . with the aim of simplicity",
    "we follow the ideas of their earlier work@xcite more than those of their latter@xcite .",
    "hn found that the potential energy of the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) was well - reproduced by a function    @xmath75    [ eqn : udft ]    ( the second case is the limit @xmath76 of the first ) where @xmath77 takes its minimum at @xmath78 .",
    "hn found @xmath79mev , @xmath80  and @xmath81 accurately reproduced their lda calculations for graphite .",
    "we evaluated the graphite binding curve using vasp@xcite calculations with a cutoff energy of 700ev , in - plane c - c distance @xmath82   and a @xmath83-grid of @xmath84 points including the @xmath85 point , and found that the similar @xmath86mev , @xmath87  and @xmath88 gave slightly better agreement ( under 0.3mev maximum absolute error ) .",
    "we use the new parameters in this work .",
    "the hn parameters for pw91@xcite gga results were @xmath89mev , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and these provide a decent approximation to pbe@xcite data from vasp .",
    "however given its poor binding parameters , and high sensitivity to the in - plane lattice constant@xcite , we do not recommend using gga in graphenic systems , and include it mostly for illustrative purposes .",

    "the lda predicts a binding distance @xmath130 , decreased to @xmath131  via the dispersion corrections .",
    "there are no reliable experimental or high - level theory results to compare with . along with the shorter inter - layer distance , the effective elastic modulus",
    "is increased from @xmath132gpa to @xmath33gpa .",
    "finally , the lda exfoliation energy is predicted to be @xmath133jm@xmath4or 12mev / atom ( where we divide only by the number of surface atoms  four for the ab unit cell ) , while the dispersion correction increases this to a physically reasonable @xmath5jm@xmath4or 25mev / surface  atom , around 6% or @xmath134jm@xmath4  greater than the bulk layer binding energy of a graphite layer , and @xmath135jm@xmath4  greater than the bilayer binding energy .",
    "this is in good agreement with bjrkman _ _ et al.__@xcite who also found ( see figure 4 of their work ) a @xmath135jm@xmath4  difference between the exfoliation and bilayer binding energies of graphite via a different theoretical approach .    results for graphite , bigraphene and exfoliation are presented together in table  [ tab : graph ] for easy comparison .",
    "in addition to the already defined @xmath17 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 we also include the `` peak force '' @xmath136 in each geometry . here , we calculate @xmath137 and its maximum is @xmath136 ie .",
    "@xmath138 . compared to other properties of the energy curve the error on @xmath139 is quite high at around 10% .",
    "this is because the force depends on small differences in the energy at distances @xmath140 where sensitivity to numerical parameters such as",
    "the @xmath83-grid is high .",
    "the difference of the peak force with and without dispersion correction is expected to be more accurate due to cancellation of errors .",
    "as a function of @xmath1 in the lda and lda with vdw dispersion corrections.[fig : eli ] ]    we now test the theory on lithium intercalated graphite in the @xmath141 configuration .",
    "lic@xmath2 is a well - studied material ( see e.g. the review of dresselhaus and dresselhaus@xcite , and refs .  ) , and the binding is mostly chemical .",
    "we note that the graphene sheets of lic@xmath2 are , in fact , doped to become metallic so that the plasmon - dispersions are changed from graphitic to metallic and the unusual part of the vdw potential is changed .",
    "however , at the intermediate distances of interest , the contribution of the metallic / graphitic transitions is a very small part of the total dispersion , and we thus use unchanged . for larger @xmath1 this approximation would break down .",
    "we evaluate lic@xmath2 using default parameters in vasp , and with an @xmath142 @xmath83-grid including the @xmath85 point .",
    "the inplane c - c bond length is set to its experimental value @xmath143 .",
    "results are presented in figure  [ fig : eli ] with and without corrections . like bigraphene",
    ", we find little change to the binding distance of lic@xmath2 at @xmath144 , comparable with the experimental@xcite value @xmath145*???*. assuming no relaxation in the planar cell , the ` straight ' binding energy per unit area of an intercalate xc@xmath146 is @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the area of the graphene unit cell with two atoms at their intercalated distance . for lic@xmath2 this increases from @xmath149mev / atom@xmath150jm@xmath4  to @xmath151mev / atom@xmath152jm@xmath4(where we divide by the number of _ carbon _ atoms  six for the unit cell of lic@xmath2 ) .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath10 of lic@xmath2 is increased slightly from 74gpa to 76gpa which compares well with experiment where@xcite @xmath153gpa .",
    "as one expects the model correction makes little difference to the mechanics or energetics of the intercalate , because dispersion forces are not dominant in the binding .",
    "in this work we presented an interlayer distance @xmath1-dependent , simple , parametrised model potential of graphite dispersion energies , and total graphite binding energies valid for distances from just inside contact to infinity . the model can be employed on its own or as a correction to standard dft ( lda / gga ) calculations to improve their energetics .",
    "geometry dependent corrections were then introduced to deal with bigraphene and graphite exfoliation . as a correction the model takes the form@xcite @xmath154}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for graphite , and the geometry adapted forms for bigraphene and for exfoliation .",
    "it includes models of the dispersion [ eqn  ] and dft [ eqn  ] energetics , interpolated by a fitting function [ eqn  ] .",
    "parameters for all functions were determined by fitting the model to high - level rpa _ ab initio _ theory results and the theoretical asymptotic dispersion of graphite , and are summarised in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "the model was used to predict the binding energy of bigraphene and exfoliation energy of graphite , with results in good agreement with previous theory .",
    "layers of bigraphene were found to be marginally less bound at @xmath3jm@xmath4  than those of graphite at @xmath6jm@xmath4 , while the energy of exfoliation @xmath5jm@xmath4   was found to be slightly larger .",
    "additionally , the model was tested on stage 1 lithium intercalated graphite and found to make only a small change to the energetics , as appropriate .",
    "we believe that the models presented in this paper can provide a simple way of improving _ ab initio _ calculations of graphite without resorting to extremely expensive methods such as acfd - rpa .",
    "the dispersion modelling and fitting technique employed here can also be adapted to other layered materials for which conventional modelling techniques struggle due to the presence of coupled plasmons .",
    "our non - pairwise model could also be employed alongside existing vdw approaches such as the dft - d*@xcite or ts@xcite functionals that account for pairwise atomistic dispersion , provided c - c interactions are ignored in the pairwise approach to avoid double counting .",

    "jfd was also supported by a visiting position at universit de lorraine .",
    "sl acknowledges financial support from the universit de lorraine through the program `` soutien  la dimension internationale de la recherche '' .",
    "the parametrisation given in equations  can be shown to be equally valid for bigraphene as for graphite . however , parameters such as @xmath155 and @xmath156 require rpa fitting to be determined , and energy results are not available for the case of bigraphene .    energy data for @xmath157 and @xmath104 are available , and fits show that the variation in @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath122 and @xmath158 are minimal when we change from a graphite to bigraphene geometry .",
    "the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath60 and @xmath121 are , unsurprisingly , strongly geometry dependent , as each is proportional to the energetics which vary with the proximity of other layers .",
    "we thus assume that only those three parameters are changed from their graphite values , and that the bigraphene parametrisation can be described by the graphene parameters and additional geometry scaling factors @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 such that eg .",

    "@xmath57 is calculated through eq .",
    "12 of ref .  .",

    "@xmath164 $ ] by the bigraphene screened response integral @xmath165 $ ] . evaluating this integral with a cutoff energy of 5ev",
    "also allows us to show that @xmath166 and @xmath167 change only a little from their graphite values .",
    "the factor is thus @xmath168 .    in the absence of numerical rpa data , to calculate @xmath160 we rely on the argument that the ` usual ' dispersion terms are additive .",
