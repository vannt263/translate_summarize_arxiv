    "only about twenty years ago it was put forward by bonioff @xcite and feynmann @xcite the idea of building up of computers based on the principles of quantum mechanics which was developed concretely by david deutsch @xcite  in 1985 . since then it has been discussed in the literature the possible implications of quantum entanglement schrodinger and non - locality in the broad new and promising filed of research embracing quantum information and quantum computation nielsen , mathqc , pqi .",
