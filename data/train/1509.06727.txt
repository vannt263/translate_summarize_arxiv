    "systematic measurements of the centrality dependence of transverse energy production and charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity provide excellent characterization of the nuclear geometry of the reaction and are sensitive to the dynamics of the colliding system .",
    "for example , measurements of and in collisions at = 200  gev and 130  gev as a function of centrality expressed as the number of participant nucleons , , exhibit a nonlinear increase with increasing .",
    "this has been explained by a two - component model proportional to a linear combination of the number of collisions , , and  @xcite . in a previous study by the phenix collaboration , measurements of and for collisions at 200 , 130 , and 62.4",
    "gev are presented along with comparisons to the results of several models  @xcite .",
    "the models that were examined included hijing  @xcite , a final state parton saturation model called ekrt  @xcite , an initial state parton saturation model called kln  @xcite , and a multiphase transport model called ampt  @xcite .",
    "the comparisons showed that most models could reproduce some of the features of the data , but most failed in describing all of the data with the hijing and ampt models best describing the overall trends , including the nonlinear increase of and as a function of .",
    "it was also proposed that is linearly proportional to the number of constituent - quark participants without a significant contribution from a hard scattering component  @xcite .",
    "recently , the phenix collaboration at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , presented distributions at midrapidity for collisions at = 200 , 130 , and 62.4  gev , collisions at = 200  gev , and collisions at = 200  gev  @xcite .",
    "the data are better described by a model based upon the number of constituent quark participants than by the wounded nucleon model  @xcite . here , this study will be extended to include both and measurements at midrapidity in collisions down to = 7.7  gev .",
    "this study will also examine the centrality dependence of and for smaller systems including , , , and .",
    "recent lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations indicate that the transition from quark to hadronic matter is a crossover transition at high temperature and small baryochemical potential , @xmath13  @xcite . at high values of @xmath13 and low temperatures , model calculations",
    "indicate the presence of a first - order phase transition and the possibility of a critical end point in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions serve as excellent probes of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the region of the qcd phase diagram sampled by the collisions can be controlled by changing the beam energy .",
    "lowering the beam energy corresponds to raising the value of @xmath13 . from 2010 to 2014 , rhic executed a beam energy scan program to explore the qcd phase diagram , look for evidence of the phase boundaries and search for evidence of the critical end point .",
    "presented here are and measurements from the beam energy scan as a function of centrality expressed as the number of nucleon participants , , from collisions at = 200 , 130 , 62.4 , 39 , 27 , 19.6 , 14.5 , and 7.7  gev .    over the past 15 years",
    ", phenix has collected a comprehensive dataset covering a wide variety of colliding nuclei and collision energies , including the collision beam energy scan mentioned above . presented here",

    "the results will be discussed in the context of scaling with the number of participant nucleons ( ) and the number of participant quarks ( ) .",

    "the previously published phenix results will be presented along with data from the many new collision systems in a consistent format to facilitate comparisons .",
    "similar measurements have been published by the other rhic experiments .",

    "section  [ sec : summary ] contains a summary of the results .",
    "data tables for all data sets are tabulated in the appendix .",
    "the phenix detector comprises two central spectrometer arms , two muon spectrometer arms , and a set of forward detectors .",
    "all of the detector components and their performance is described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of charged particle multiplicity utilizes detectors in the central arm spectrometer  @xcite including the drift chamber ( dc ) and pad chamber 1 ( pc1 ) detectors .",
    "the drift chambers are cylindrically shaped and located radially from 2.0 to 2.4 meters .",
    "the dc covers the pseudorapidity region @xmath140.35 and @xmath15 in azimuth for each arm .",
    "the dc has a resolution better than 150 @xmath16 m in r-@xmath17 , better than 2 mm in the z direction , and a two track separation better than 1.5 mm .",
    "the pc1 detector is a multiwire proportional chamber mounted on the outer radius of the drift chamber at 2.5 m from the beam axis .",
    "pc1 covers the full central arm acceptance .",
    "pc1 measures minimum ionizing particles with an efficiency greater than 99.5% with a position resolution of 1.7 mm by 3 mm and a two track separation of 4 cm .",
    "reconstructed tracks from the drift chamber with an associated hit from pc1 are counted as charged particle tracks in the multiplicity measurement .",
    "the analysis of transverse energy utilizes five of the lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) electromagnetic - calorimeter ( emcal ) sectors in the central arm spectrometers  @xcite .",
    "each calorimeter sector covers a pseudorapidity range of @xmath140.38 and subtends @xmath18 in azimuth for a total azimuthal coverage of @xmath19 .",
    "the front face of each sector is located 5.1 m from the beam axis .",
    "each sector contains 2592 pbsc towers arranged in a 36 @xmath20 72 array .",
    "each tower has a 5.535 @xmath20 5.535 cm surface area and a thickness of 0.85 nuclear interaction lengths or 18 radiation lengths .",
    "the pbsc emcal energy resolution has been measured using test beam electrons to be @xmath21 2.1% , with a measured response proportional to the incident electron energy to within @xmath22 over the range @xmath23  gev .    for all data sets ,",
    "a minimum - bias trigger is provided by a pair of beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite .",
    "each bbc comprises 64 individual erenkov counters .",
    "each bbc covers 2@xmath24 azimuthally and a pseudorapidity range of 3.0 @xmath25 3.9 . for , , and collisions ,",
    "an event is required to have at least one counter fire in each bbc . for all other collisions",
    ", at least two counters must fire in each bbc .",
    "the event vertex is reconstructed with a resolution of 2.0  cm in collisions and 0.5  mm in central collisions using the timing information from the bbcs .",
    "all events are required to have an event vertex within 20 cm of the center of the detector .",
    "centrality determination in the original = 200  gev and = 130  gev phenix analysis is based upon the total charge deposited in the bbcs and the total energy deposited in the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite .",
    "the zdcs are a pair of hadronic calorimeters that cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath266 . for subsequent data sets taken after 2002",
    ", only the bbc information is used for the centrality determination , including the following data sets : at = 200  gev , at = 200  gev , at = 193  gev , at = 200  gev , and at = 200  gev . as the collision energy decreases ,",
    "the width of the pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles becomes more narrow  @xcite . as a result , for energies below = 130",
    "gev , the acceptance of the zdc is reduced , therefore only the bbc information is used for collisions at = 62.4 and 39  gev , and for collisions at = 62.4  gev . below = 39  gev ,",
    "the bbc acceptance becomes sensitive to the presence of beam fragments , which affects the linear response of the bbc to the centrality . to avoid this nonlinear response",
    ", the reaction - plane detector ( rxnp )  @xcite is used for the centrality determination for collisions at = 7.7  gev , which was taken during the 2010 running period .",
    "the rxnp comprises two sets of plastic scintillators positioned on either side of the collision vertex .",
    "each rxnp detector is arranged in 12 azimuthal segments separated into an inner and outer ring .",
    "the rxnp has an azimuthal coverage of 2@xmath24 .",
    "the pseudorapidity coverage is 1.5@xmath272.8 and 1.0@xmath271.5 for the inner and outer ring , respectively .",
    "a 2 cm thick lead converter is located directly in front of the rxnp scintillators with respect to the collision region , which allows the rxnp to also measure contributions from neutral particles through conversion electrons .",
    "the rxnp is designed to measure the reaction plane angle , but it can also function well as a centrality detector , because the magnitude of the total charge measured by the rxnp is dependent on the centrality of the collision . in order to minimize contamination from beam fragments , only the outer ring of the rxnp",
    "is used for centrality determination for collisions at = 7.7  gev . for the 2011 data taking period and",
    "later when the data sets at = 27 , 19.6 , and 14.5  gev were collected , the rxnp was removed in order to install a silicon vertex detector , which was being commissioned during this time .",
    "so , for these two data sets , the multiplicity of hits in the pc1 detector were used to determine the centrality .",
    "a summary of the centrality detectors used for each dataset is included in table  [ tab : datasetsummary ] .",
    "table  [ tab : datasetsummary ] provides a summary of the data sets used in this analysis . for collisions at = 62.4",
    "gev , the analysis uses data taken in 2004  @xcite and the analysis uses data taken in 2010 . the number of events are those events that pass the minimum - bias trigger condition for the dataset and have an event vertex within 20 cm of the center of the detector .",
