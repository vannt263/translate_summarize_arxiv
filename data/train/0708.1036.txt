    "geometric evolution equation which is called ricci flow equation introduced by hamilton in @xcite has been prominently studied by mathematicians due to its achievement in solving famous three - dimensional puzzles , namely poincar and thurston s geometrization conjectures @xcite .",
    "moreover ,  in  higher dimensional manifold , particularly in compact khler manifold with the first chern class @xmath3 or @xmath4 , one can then reprove the well - known calabi conjecture using the so called khler  ricci flow equation @xcite .",
    "several authors have studied to construct a soliton of the khler  ricci flow with @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "such a solution is one of our interest and related to the subject of this paper .    in the physical context , this khler ",
    "ricci flow can be regarded as a one - loop approximation to the physical renormalization group equation of two - dimensional theories at quantum level .",
    "for example , some authors have discussed it in the context of wilsonian renormalization group coming from @xmath5 supersymmetry in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "however this is not the case in higher dimension , particularly in four dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the nature of chiral @xmath0 supersymmetric theories in four dimensions together with its solutions , when the scalar manifold described by the khler manifold is no longer static . in the sense that it is a khler ",
    "ricci soliton generating a one - parameter family of khler manifolds which evolves with respect to a parameter , say @xmath6 .",
    "this further imply that all couplings such as scalar potential , fermion mass matrix , and gravitino mass do have evolution with respect to the flow parameter  @xmath6 .",
    "particularly in local theory such deformation happens in its solitonic solution , like bps domain walls that have residual supersymmetry .",
    "this can be easily seen because all quantities such as warped factor , bps equations , and the beta function of field theory in the context of anti de sitter ( ads)/conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence ( for a review , see for example  @xcite ) do depend on @xmath6 . in this paper",
    ", we carry out the analysis on critical points of the scalar potential describing lorentz invariant vacua on which the bps equations and the beta function vanish .",
    "the first step is to consider the second - order analysis using hessian matrix of the scalar potential which gives the index of the vacua .",
    "the next step is to perform a first - order analysis of the beta function for verifying the existence of an ads vacuum which corresponds to a cft in three dimensions .",
    "we realize our analysis into two models as follows .    in the first model we have a global and local @xmath0 supersymmetric theories on the soliton where the initial manifold is khler  einstein whose `` cosmological constant '' is chosen , for example , to be positive , namely @xmath7 . by taking",
    "@xmath8 the flow turns out to be collapsed to a point at @xmath9 and correspondingly , both global and local @xmath0 theories blow up .",
    "furthermore , this geometric flow interpolates between two different theories which are disconnected by the singularity at @xmath9 , namely @xmath0 theories on khler  einstein manifold with @xmath10 in the interval @xmath11 , while for @xmath12 it becomes @xmath0 theories on khler  einstein manifold with @xmath13 and opposite metric signature which yields a theory with wrong - sign kinetic terms and therefore , might be considered as `` ghosts '' at the quantum level .",
    "consequently , in global @xmath0 chiral theory such evolution of soliton results in the deformation of the supersymmetric minkowskian vacua which can be immediately observed from the parity transformation of the hessian matrix of the scalar potential that changes the index of the vacua if they are nondegenerate . in local theory , we get the same situation for nondegenerate minkowskian vacua .",
    "these happen because only the geometric ( khler  ricci ) flow affects the index of the vacua in the second - order    in ads ground states we have however a different situation . in this case both the geometric flow and the coupling quantities such as the holomorphic superpotential and the fermionic mass do play a role in determining the index of the vacua .",
    "therefore , we have to enforce certain conditions on the hessian matrix of the scalar potential in order to obtain the parity transformation .",
    "in addition , there is a possibility of having a condition where the degeneracy of the vacua can also be modified by the khler  ricci flow .",
    "for example , in @xmath14 model with linear superpotential , we find that this geometric flow transforms a nondegenerate vacuum to a degenerate vacuum and vice versa with respect to @xmath6 before and after singular point at @xmath15 . in this model ,",
    "degenerate vacuum possibly could not exist particularly in the infrared ( ir ) ( low energy scale ) region .",
    "now we turn to consider the second model , namely @xmath0 theories on @xmath1 invariant khler ",
    "ricci soliton constructed over line bundle of @xmath2 with positive definite metric for @xmath8 @xcite . near the origin , the soliton turns to the khler ",
    "einstein manifold , namely @xmath16 .",
    "hence , we have to analyze its behavior in the asymptotic region . by taking @xmath10 case",
    ", we find that the soliton collapses into a khler cone at @xmath17 which is singular .",
    "moreover , the soliton is asymptotically dominated by the cone metric which is positive definite for all @xmath18 . as a result",
    "the vacuum is static , or in other words it does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , no parity transformation of the hessian matrix and no other vacuum modification caused by the geometric flow  exist .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ eekrf ] we introduce the notion of khler  ricci flow equation with its solutions .",
    "section [ stks ] consists of two part discussions about the global and local @xmath0 supersymmetry on general khler ",
    "ricci soliton .",
    "then , we construct bps domain wall solutions in section [ bpssec ] . in section [ susykem ]",
    "we discuss the behavior of the supersymmetric lorentz invariant vacua on khler ",
    "einstein manifold and gives an explicit model .",
    "section [ susykrs ] provides a review of @xmath1 symmetric khler ",
    "ricci soliton together with our analysis on its vacua .",
    "we finally conclude our results in section  [ concl ] .",
    "this section is devoted to give a background about ricci flow defined on a complex manifold endowed with khler metric which is called khler  ricci flow .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the solution of this khler ",
    "ricci flow remains khler as demanded by @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "there are some excellent references on this subject for interested reader , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we collect some evolution equations of riemann curvature , ricci tensor , and ricci scalar in appendix  c.    a khler manifold @xmath19 is a khler ",
    "ricci soliton if it satisfies @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the flow @xmath22 has the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 , the map @xmath25 is a diffeomorphism , and @xmath26 is the initial metric at @xmath27 which fulfills the following identity @xmath28 for some real constant @xmath29 and some holomorphic vector fields follows from the fact that the complex structure @xmath30 on @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 . ]",
    "@xmath33 on @xmath31 where @xmath34 .",
    "the vector field @xmath35 is related to a @xmath6-dependent vector field @xmath36 by @xmath37 which generates a family of diffeomorphisms @xmath25 and satisfies the following equation @xmath38 with @xmath39      we turn to consider the case where @xmath35 vanishes . in this case , the initial metric is khler ",
    "einstein @xmath40 for some constants @xmath41 .",
    "taking @xmath42 and then from the definition of ricci tensor , one finds that @xmath43 so the solution of ( [ krf ] ) can be obtained as @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the khler potential has the  form @xmath46    if we take the khler  ricci flow ( [ krf ] ) to evolve for @xmath8 , then for the case @xmath13 the metric ( [ solkem ] ) is smoothly expanded and no collapsing flow exists . on the other hand , in the case @xmath47 it collapses to a point at @xmath9 , but reappear for @xmath12 which is diffeomorphic to a manifold with @xmath48 and its metric signature is opposite with the initial metric defined in ( [ kemet ] ) . and [ lsc ] . ]",
    "note that in both cases the flow also becomes singular as @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , if the initial metric is ricci flat , namely @xmath50 , then it is clear that the metric does not change under  ( [ krf ] ) .",
    "now let us discuss the @xmath51 case .",
    "our particular interest is the case where the holomorphic vector field ( [ killdiff ] ) can also be written  as @xmath52 for some real functions @xmath53 on @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we say that @xmath22 is a gradient khler ",
    "ricci soliton @xcite .",
    "in this case , in general , there are three possible solutions .",
    "for @xmath7 we have a shrinking gradient khler ",
    "ricci soliton , whereas the soliton is an expanding gradient khler ",
    "ricci soliton for @xmath54 .",
    "the case where @xmath50 is a steady gradient khler ",

    "in fact , on any compact khler manifold , a gradient steady or expanding khler ",

    "einstein manifold because the real function @xmath53 is just a constant @xcite .",
    "we give an explicit construction of these expanding and shrinking khler ",
    "ricci solitons in section  [ susykrs ] .",
    "in this section we discuss @xmath0 supersymmetric theory in four dimensions whose nonlinear @xmath55-model describing a khler geometry supersymmetry the scalar manifold @xmath56 is khler , whereas local @xmath0 supersymmetry demands that the scalar manifold @xmath56 has to be hodge  khler @xcite , see the next subsection . ]",
    "@xmath19 satisfies one - parameter khler",
    " ricci flow equation ( [ krf ] ) .",
    "this equation tells us that the dynamics of the metric @xmath57 with respect to @xmath6 is determined by the ricci tensor @xmath58 .",
    "thus , it follows that the @xmath0 theory is deformed with respect to @xmath6 as discussed in the following .",
    "we divide the discussion into two parts . in the first part we construct a global @xmath0 chiral supersymmetry as a toy model .",
    "then , in the second part we extend the construction to a local supersymmetry , namely @xmath0 chiral supergravity which corresponds to our analysis for the most part of this  paper .",
    "first of all , let us focus on the properties of the deformed global @xmath0 chiral supersymmetric theory in four dimensions .",
    "the spectrum of the theory consists of a spin-@xmath59 fermion @xmath60 and a complex scalar @xmath61 with @xmath62 . as mentioned above , the complex scalars @xmath63 parameterize a khler geometry @xmath19 . the construction of the global @xmath0 theory on khler ",
    "ricci soliton is as follows .",
    "first , we consider the chiral lagrangian in ( for a pedagogical review of @xmath0 supersymmetry , see for example  @xcite ) , say @xmath64 , where the metric of the scalar manifold is static .",
    "then , replacing all geometric quantities such as the metric @xmath65 by the soliton @xmath66 , the on - shell @xmath0 chiral lagrangian can be written down up to 4-fermion term  as @xmath67 where the scalar potential has the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "the metric @xmath70 is the solution of ( [ krf ] ) , where the real function @xmath71 is a khler potential .",
    "fermionic mass - like quantity @xmath72 is then given  by @xmath73 and it is related to the first derivative of the scalar potential ( [ v ] ) with respect to @xmath74 @xmath75 the supersymmetry transformation of the fields up to 3-fermion terms leaving the lagrangian invariant ( [ globl ] )  are @xmath76 since the evolution of the metric @xmath66 is determined by the ricci tensor @xmath77 , one can directly see that the dynamics of the scalar potential ( [ v ] ) and the fermionic mass ( [ fermass ] ) has a similar behavior with respect to @xmath6 , namely @xmath78 where @xmath79 .    to make the above formula clearer",
    ", we now turn to discuss an example where the initial geometry ( at @xmath27 ) is khler  einstein manifold , as discussed in section [ eekrf ] .",
    "this follows that the equations in ( [ dvt ] ) are simplified  into @xmath80 the first equation in ( [ dvtke ] ) has the solution @xmath81 whereas the second equation tells us that the fermion mass matrix @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath6 . as the flow ( [ solkem ] ) deforms for @xmath8",
    ", the lagrangian ( [ globl ] ) can be smoothly defined and there is no singularity for the case @xmath13 .",
    "this follows that in this case we have a well - defined theory as the khler geometry changed with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the case @xmath47 since the flow ( [ solkem ] ) shrinks to a point at @xmath9 the scalar potential ( [ vke ] ) becomes singular and the lagrangian ( [ globl ] ) diverges .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above for @xmath82 , the flow evolves again and it is related to another @xmath0 global theory on a khler ",
    "einstein manifold with @xmath13 and different metric signature .    to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath83 be the initial geometry which is khler ",
    "einstein manifold with @xmath84 whose metric @xmath65 is positive definite .",
    "next , we cast ( [ ricckem ] ) to the following  form @xmath85 where @xmath86 in the interval @xmath11 , the solution is diffeomorphic to the initial geometry . however , for @xmath12 we have a khler  einstein geometry @xmath87 with a negative definite metric @xmath66 and @xmath88 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , such a metric produces a theory with wrong - sign kinetic terms and could be interpreted as ghosts .",
    "similar result can also be achieved for the case where the initial geometry is a khler  einstein geometry with indefinite metric where @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "then , we have also an indefinite khler ",
    "einstein metric but with @xmath89 for @xmath90 .      in this subsection",
    ", we generalize the previous result to a local @xmath0 supersymmetry . in four dimensions the spectrum of a generic chiral @xmath0 supergravity theory consists of a gravitational multiplet and @xmath91 chiral multiplets .",
    "these multiplets are decomposed of the following component fields :    * a gravitational multiplet @xmath92 this multiplet consist of the graviton @xmath93 and a gravitino @xmath94 . for the gravitino @xmath95 and the upper or lower index",
    "denotes left or right chirality , respectively . * @xmath91 chiral multiplets",
    "@xmath96 each chiral multiplet consist of a spin-@xmath59 fermion @xmath60 and a complex scalar @xmath61 .",
    "local supersymmetry further requires the scalar manifold @xmath56 spanned by the complex scalars @xmath63 to be a hodge  khler manifold with an additional @xmath97-connection @xmath98 where @xmath99 and the metric @xmath100 where the khler potential @xmath101 is an arbitrary real function @xcite . in our case",
    "since @xmath57 is the solution of ( [ krf ] ) , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 must be @xmath6-dependent .",
    "similar as in the global case , we first consider the chiral theory studied in @xcite .",
    "then , by employing the same procedure the @xmath0 lagrangian up to four - fermions terms on khler",
    " ricci soliton has thefollowing form @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be written in terms of an ( anti)-holomorphic superpotential function of @xmath106 , @xmath107 with @xmath71 is a khler potential of the chiral multiplets , and the quantities @xmath108 are given  by : @xmath109 on the other hand , the @xmath0 scalar potential can be expressed in terms of @xmath110 as @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "then the first derivative of @xmath113 with respect to @xmath63 are of the form @xmath114 the supersymmetry transformation laws up to 3-fermion terms leaving ( [ l1 ] )  are : @xmath115 where @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is a @xmath97-connection which is the first derivative of the khler potential @xmath71 with respect to @xmath118 . here ,",
    "we have defined @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore the evolution of the coupling quantities beside the metric @xmath66 in ( [ l1 ] ) are given  by @xmath120    similar as in the global case , we finally take an example where the initial metric is khler  einstein . in this case",
    "the metric evolves with respect to @xmath6 as in ( [ solkem ] ) and the @xmath97-connection takes the  form @xmath121 since the khler potential is given by ( [ kpotkem ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath8 , the theory is well defined for @xmath13 , while for @xmath47 it becomes singular at @xmath9 . in the latter case ,",
    "namely @xmath84 case , the @xmath0 local theory is changed and the shape of the scalar manifold is a khler ",
    "einstein manifold with @xmath13 and moreover , the metric signature has opposite sign .",
    "thus , we have a gravitational multiplet coupled to chiral multiplets which might be considered as ghosts .",
    "here , we turn our attention to discuss a ground state which breaks lorentz invariance partially and preserves half of the supersymmetry of the parental theory , namely the bps domain wall in @xmath0 supergravity . this type of solution was firstly discovered in @xcite .",
    "interested reader can further consult @xcite for an excellent review of this subject . in this section",
    "some conventions follow rather closely to @xcite .    the first step is to take the ansatz metric as @xmath122 where @xmath123",
    ", @xmath124 is a three - dimensional minkowskian metric , and then the corresponding ricci scalar has the  form @xmath125\\!,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 . here",
    ", @xmath127 is the warped factor assumed to be @xmath6 dependent . for the shake of simplicity we set @xmath128 on the background ( [ dwans ] ) and then",
    ", the supersymmetry transformation ( [ susyvar1 ] ) becomes @xmath129 furthermore , all supersymmetric variations ( [ susyvar2 ] ) vanish in order to have residual supersymmetry on the ground states .",
    "we then simply assign that @xmath130 and @xmath61 depend on both @xmath131 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the first equation in ( [ susyvar2 ] ) shows that @xmath130 indeed depends on @xmath131 , while the second equation gives a projection  equation @xmath132 which further gives @xmath133 thus , equation ( [ warp ] ) shows that the warped factor @xmath134 is indeed @xmath6-dependent , which is consistent with our ansatz ( [ dwans ] ) . introducing a real function @xmath135 , the third equation in ( [ susyvar2 ] ) results in a set of bps equations @xmath136 describing gradient flows .",
    "it is important to note that using ( [ gfe ] ) it can be shown that ( [ warp ] ) is a monotonic decreasing function and corresponds to the @xmath137 -function in the holographic correspondence @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the context of cft the supersymmetric flows which is relevant for our analysis are described by a beta function @xmath138 together with its complex conjugate , after employing ( [ warp ] ) and ( [ gfe ] ) . in this description",
    "the scalar fields play a role as coupling constants and the warp factor @xmath134 can be viewed as an energy scale  @xcite .    in the analysis",
    "it is convenient that the potential ( [ v1 ] ) can be shaped into @xmath139 whose first derivative with respect to @xmath140 is given by a set of the following equation @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "note that as mentioned in the preceding section , it is possible that the theory becomes unphysical in the sense that it has wrong - sign kinetic term for finite @xmath6 .",
    "for example , it happens when the flow described by ( [ solkem ] ) for @xmath7 and @xmath143 .",
    "so , we have bps domain walls whose dynamics described by the warped factor @xmath144 are controlled by ghosts .",
    "now let us turn to consider the gradient flow equation ( [ gfe ] ) and the first derivative of the scalar potential ( [ dv ] ) .",
    "critical points of ( [ gfe ] ) are  determined  by @xmath145 which leads to @xmath146 it turns out that the critical points of @xmath147 are related to the lorentz invariant vacua described by the @xmath0 scalar potential @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , the existence of such points can be checked by the beta function ( [ beta ] ) , which means that these could be in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region if @xmath149 or in the infrared ( ir ) region if @xmath150 .",
    "these aspects will be addressed in section  [ susykem ] and section  [ susykrs ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to present analysis of deformation of supersymmetric lorentz invariant ground states on the khler ",
    "ricci flow when the initial geometry is khler  einstein geometry .",
    "as mentioned above , these vacua correspond to critical points of ( [ gfe ] ) .",
    "in particular , our interest is the ads vacua which correspond to the cft .",
    "our analysis here is in the context of the morse theory @xcite and the morse ",
    "bott theory @xcite , and in addition , applying the rg flow analysis to check the existence of such vacua .",
    "we organize this section into two parts .",
    "first , we perform the analysis to the vacua of the global @xmath0 theory",
    ". then we generalize it to the local @xmath0 theory which are related to the bps domain wall solutions .",
    "we leave the proof of some theorems here in appendix  b.      let us first investigate some properties of supersymmetric lorentz invariant ground states of the theory where all fermions and @xmath151 are set to be zero . in a smooth region , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no collapsing flow , at the ground state @xmath152 we find that supersymmetric conditions @xmath153 imply the set of equation in ( [ dvz ] ) and supersymmetry transformation ( [ susyvar ] ) to be vanished",
    ". in other words , critical point of holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 defines a vacuum of the theory and @xmath155 does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the vacuum is fixed in this case .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see from ( [ dvt ] ) that at the vacua the scalar potential and the mass matrix of fermions do not change with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "so in order to characterize the ground states , we have to consider the second - order derivative of the scalar potential ( [ v ] ) with respect to @xmath140 called hessian matrix evaluated at @xmath156 , whose nonzero component has the  form @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a khler ",
    "einstein metric and we have assumed here that @xmath159 is invertible",
    ". then ( [ hessv ] ) leads to the following statements :    [ section ]    [ lemmavmorse ] the scalar potential @xmath160 is a morse function if and only if the superpotential @xmath154 has no degenerate critical points .",
    "we want to mention here that the above lemma implies that the superpotential is at least general quadratic function , namely , @xmath161 , where the matrix coupling @xmath162 is invertible .",
    "correspondingly , all eigenvalues of the fermion mass matrix ( [ fermass ] ) evaluated at @xmath156 are nonzero .",
    "for the rest of the paper , if @xmath160 is a morse function , then we name it the morse potential .",
    "furthermore , we have the following consequence .",
    "[ vmorse]corollary    [ colisol ] all supersymmetric ground states of the morse potential @xmath160 are nondegenerate @xmath163isolated@xmath164 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath160 is a morse function we can assign any supersymmetric vacuum by morse index describing the number of negative eigenvalue of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv ] ) . looking at ( [ hessv ] ) , we find that for @xmath8 and  @xmath165 @xmath166 which shows the existence of parity transformation of the hessian matrix at @xmath156 caused by the metric ( [ solkem ] ) mapping the morse index from , say @xmath167 , to another morse index @xmath168 .",
    "so , we can write our main result of global supersymmetric vacua on khler  einstein manifold as follows .",

    "furthermore , around @xmath156 we can introduce real local coordinates @xmath171 with @xmath172 such  that @xmath173 where @xmath174 with @xmath10 for @xmath8 .",
    "note that for @xmath13 , the factor @xmath175 , and in this case we have only @xmath176 for @xmath8 .",
    "similar result can also be obtained for static case , namely , for @xmath50 or the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "let us start to discuss theorem  [ modmorselemma ] by taking the example discussed in the previous section where the initial geometry is a khler  einstein geometry @xmath83 with positive definite metric and @xmath165 .",
    "looking at ( [ ricckem1 ] ) , we find that the flow gives the same shape as the initial geometry @xmath83 for @xmath11 , while for @xmath12 the flow turns into a khler  einstein geometry @xmath177 with negative definite metric and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , this geometrical deformation causes the parity transformation of the matrix ( [ hessv ] ) that changes the index @xmath167 for @xmath178 to @xmath170 for @xmath12 of the same ground state .",
    "similar as preceding subsection we consider here the smooth region where the geometric flow does not vanish .",
    "our interest here is to study supersymmetric vacuum @xmath179 in local case which demands  that @xmath180 has to hold and correspondingly , both bps equations in ( [ gfe ] ) and the beta function ( [ beta ] ) vanish .",

    "as mentioned in the previous subsection , the morse index of a vacua is given by the negative eigenvalues of ( [ hessv1 ] ) describing unstable directions .",
    "along these directions , the gradient flows provided by ( [ gfe ] ) are unstable and therefore , we have unstable walls in the context of dynamical system . on the other side ,",
    "we obtain a stable solution along stable direction described by the positive eigenvalues of ( [ hessv1 ] ) . finally , to check the existence of such vacua in the ir and uv regions , we need to consider a first - order expansion of the beta function ( [ beta ] ) at @xmath156 provided  by @xmath187    \\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{j } } \\beta^i   & &    \\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{j } } \\bar{\\beta}^{\\bar{i } } \\\\ \\end{matrix } \\right)(p_0 ; \\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath188 \\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{j } } \\beta^i(p_0 ; \\tau ) & = - 2 \\sigma(\\tau)^{-1}g^{i \\bar{k}}(p_0 ; 0 ) \\frac{\\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{j } } \\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{k } }   { \\mathcal{w}}(p_0 ; \\tau)}{{\\mathcal{w}}(p_0 ; \\tau)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the rests are their complex conjugate . in order to have a vacuum in the uv region , at least one eigenvalue of the matrix ( [ beta1 ] )",
    "must be positive , because the rg flow departs the region in this direction .",
    "on the other side , in the ir region the rg flow approaches a vacuum in the direction of negative eigenvalue of ( [ beta1 ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider two cases , namely the morse theory analysis for nondegenerate vacua and then , degenerate vacua using morse  bott theory .",
    "let us first discuss the case in which the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) is morse potential . for @xmath189 , the ground states are flat minkowskian spacetime and we regain the condition ( [ susycon ] ) , which means that @xmath156 is fixed and does not evolve with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , the warped factor equals @xmath190 and can be rescaled by coordinate redefinition . in this case",
    ", the only nonzero coupling is the fermionic mass matrix defined in ( [ fermass1 ] ) which deforms with respect to @xmath6 as one can directly see from ( [ fermass2 ] ) .",
    "this follows that the non zero components of the hessian ( [ hessv1 ] )  are @xmath191 which means that the nondegeneracy of the vacua is determined by the holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 .",
    "moreover , the property of the vacua does not change if we set @xmath192 , so the analysis is similar to the global case . in other words , they have the same properties as in the second - order analysis for @xmath193 .",
    "then , in this case the holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 has at least general quadratic form discussed in the preceding subsection .",
    "note that in this case the matrix ( [ beta1 ] ) is meaningless because these are not related to the cft in three dimensions and , additionally , it diverges .",
    "the other case , namely @xmath194 , is curved symmetric spacetime with negative cosmological constant , called ads . in this case",
    ", the vacuum @xmath156 depends on @xmath6 if @xmath195 , which means that our ground state @xmath196 and , moreover , all couplings ( [ gravitinomass ] ) to ( [ v1 ] ) do deform with respect to @xmath6 .",
    ", so the metric ( [ solkem ] ) may change the nature of the vacua .",
    "therefore , such vacua are dynamical with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "] in addition , we assume that the sign of the initial metric evaluated at @xmath196 , namely @xmath197 , is unchanged and well defined for @xmath8 but not at the singular flow .",
    "then from ( [ warp1 ] ) we can choose , for example , a model with positive sign where for finite @xmath6 , the uv region can be defined around @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "additionally , the ir region in this case is around @xmath200 and  @xmath150 .    unlike minkowskian cases , in ads vacua we can not trivially observe geometrical change of the vacua after the metric ( [ solkem ] ) hits the singularity at @xmath9 with @xmath10 indicated by the parity transformation of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one has to enforce additional conditions in order to achieve such particular situation .",
    "the next step is to analyze the eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ beta1 ] ) whether such vacua exist in the uv and ir regions .    before coming to the result described by the theorem below ,",
    "let us define some quantities related to the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) in the following : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is given in ( [ varep ] ) .",
    "particular result in a nondegenerate ads case where the parity transformation of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) is manifest can then be written as follows .",
    "[ vmorse]theorem    [ lemmavmorse1 ] let @xmath113 be a morse potential and @xmath203 be an isolated ads ground state of the morse index @xmath167 for @xmath11 with @xmath10 .",
    "then , there are real local coordinates @xmath204 around @xmath205 with @xmath206 such  that @xmath207 suppose that for all @xmath62 the following inequalities @xmath208 hold for @xmath8 and @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath210 be another isolated vacuum for @xmath211 and both @xmath212 exist in the uv or ir regions .",
    "then , khler  ricci flow causes a parity transformation of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) , that maps @xmath205 of the index @xmath167 to @xmath213 of the index @xmath170 such that around @xmath213 real local coordinates @xmath214 exist  and @xmath215 for @xmath82 .",
    "our comments of the above theorem are in order .",
    "firstly , in general @xmath216 and they are called parity pair of the vacua in the sense that @xmath205 has @xmath167 negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) , while @xmath168 negative eigenvalues belong to @xmath213 caused by the geometric flow ( [ solkem ] ) after passing the singularity at @xmath9 . on the other side ,",
    "if the inequalities ( [ mirrorcon ] ) do not hold , then @xmath205 and @xmath213 would have the same index  @xmath167 .",
    "secondly , we can reconsider the case discussed in the global case where the initial geometry is taken to be a khler  einstein geometry @xmath83 with positive definite metric and @xmath47 .",
    "however , in the dynamical ads case since @xmath196 , the holomorphic superpotential @xmath217 together with the fermion mass matrix ( [ fermass2 ] ) also control the properties of the ground states in the second - order analysis described by ( [ hessv1 ] ) .",
    "in other words , there are two aspects that play a role in the second - order analysis of vacua , namely the khler",
    " ricci flow ( [ solkem ] ) and the dynamics of coupling quantities which depend both on the form of the superpotential and the geometry .",
    "note that @xmath218 remains positive definite for @xmath8 in this  case .",
    "thirdly , the inequalities ( [ mirrorcon ] ) mean that all components of the matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) have at least to change the sign as the khler  einstein geometry evolves .",
    "this can be easily seen in a special case where @xmath219 holds for @xmath8 and @xmath209 .",
    "consequently , we have a theory in which all spin-@xmath220 fermionic are massless .",
    "then the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) has simple diagonal  form @xmath221 hence , in this case , the condition ( [ mirrorcon ] ) can be simplified by stating that the sign of @xmath218 is fixed with respect to @xmath6 in order the parity to be revealed . in @xmath10 case , we have morse index @xmath222 for @xmath178 and then , it changes to @xmath223 for @xmath82 . in other words , we have unstable walls for @xmath224 , which become stable after hitting the singularity at @xmath9 . such situation , however , does not occur in @xmath54 case and the index is still @xmath222 for  @xmath8 .    furthermore , the condition ( [ mirrorcon1 ] ) also leads to @xmath225 then , the matrix ( [ beta1 ] ) becomes simply @xmath226 which shows that these vacua only live in the uv region .",
    "on the other hand , it is also of interest to consider a case where the ground states are determined by the critical points of the holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 , i.e. , equation ( [ susycon ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "then the @xmath97-connection ( [ u1conke ] ) evaluated at @xmath156 vanishes in all order analysis .",
    "in other words , the supersymmetric condition ( [ susycon1 ] ) reduces to @xmath227 in this case , the ground state @xmath156 is coming from the critical points of @xmath154 fixed with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "so , the second - order properties of vacua described by ( [ hessv1 ] ) are fully controlled by the geometric flow and the parity transformation appears if the condition ( [ mirrorcon ] ) is also fulfilled .",
    "we finally put some remarks for the case of morse potential . in dynamical ads",
    "vacua if the condition ( [ mirrorcon ] ) is not satisfied , then the parity does not emerge but the deformation of the vacua still exists due to the khler  ricci flow .",
    "these vacua admit the same morse index @xmath167 , see the above example for @xmath228 and @xmath8 .",
    "similar things happen for the static case .",
    "in addition , since the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) is a morse potential , then it is impossible to have a degenerate vacuum .",
    "therefore , any vacuum does not deform to another vacuum with different morse index in @xmath229 with @xmath10 .",
    "thus , no index modification of the vacua exists in the interval .",
    "now we turn to consider when the ground states are degenerate .",
    "this can occur if the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) has @xmath230 zero eigenvalues with @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , the vacua can be viewed as @xmath230-dimensional submanifold of the khler  einstein manifold . for the case at hand ,",
    "the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) is a morse  bott function ( or morse  bott potential ) , which is a generalization of a morse function .",
    "if the vacua are minkowskian , then the superpotential @xmath154 must be constant or take a linear form as discussed in section [ gsc ] since the other forms are excluded .",
    "thus , we have @xmath232 and the vacuum manifold could then be the khler ",
    "einstein manifold @xmath83 or @xmath87 depending on @xmath6 and no parity transformation of the matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) caused by the flow ( [ solkem ] ) appears in this model .",
    "note that in the model at hand we also have singular ( [ beta1 ] ) because it is undefined for @xmath233 .",
    "hence , this means that the three - dimensional cft does not exist and we do not have the correspondence in the minkowskian ground states .    in ads",
    "vacua our construction is as follows .",
    "let @xmath234 be an @xmath230-dimensional vacuum submanifold of a khler  einstein geometry @xmath83 .",
    "as a set of a disjoint union of some connected smooth manifolds with finite dimension , see , for example , @xcite . ]",
    "then at any @xmath235 we can split the tangent space @xmath236  as @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the tangent space of @xmath234 and @xmath239 is the normal space of @xmath234 .",
    "moreover , the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) is nondegenerate in the normal direction to  @xmath234 .",
    "unlike the previous case , since the scalar potential is morse  bott potential , thus we have a rich and complicated structure of vacua , particularly in the dynamical case . in the following we list some possibilities .",

    "furthermore , the hessian matrix ( [ hessv1 ] ) becomes simply diagonal matrix whose nonzero elements are @xmath298 thus we have an isolated ads spacetime for @xmath299 representing unstable walls whose morse index is @xmath222 for @xmath300 .",

    "the nonzero component of the hessian matrix of the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) is given  by @xmath413 where @xmath71 and @xmath414 are the khler potential and the inverse of the metric ( [ krsol ] ) , respectively , with vanishing scalar potential .",
    "we first assume that the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) is a morse potential , so the holomorphic superpotential has at least quadratic form with invertible hessian matrix discussed in section [ gsc ] .",
    "near @xmath372 , the analysis is the same as in section [ susykem ] since we have @xmath333 , which is a khler ",
    "einstein manifold . therefore , our interest is to consider in asymptotic region @xmath415 .    for the case at hand , we take the case for @xmath8 .",
    "so , in @xmath13 case no collapsing point exists and the soliton expands smoothly , described by ( [ conexsol ] ) , whose @xmath97-connection and khler potential of the theory are given  by @xmath416 , \\nonumber\\\\ k(\\xi,\\bar{\\xi};\\tau ) & = \\int { \\rm e}^{\\lambda v/2\\mu } b\\left(\\sigma(\\tau)e^{-\\lambda v/2\\mu } \\right ) dv + c,\\label{u1conex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath417 and @xmath137 is a real constant . since @xmath394 is smooth function and , in general , positive definite",
    "as demanded by the inequalities ( [ inequal ] ) , then it is well defined and does not have other singular point , namely , for @xmath418 such  that @xmath419    this can be restated that it is impossible to have @xmath420 at which the soliton ( [ conexsol ] ) collapses to a point . on the other hand , in @xmath47 case , the soliton ( [ conshsol ] ) converges to a cone metric at @xmath9 which is singular manifold because the diffeomorphism ( [ diffeo3 ] ) diverges .",
    "the function @xmath406 should have the same behavior as @xmath394 , i.e. , it does not satisfy ( [ bsmooth ] ) for @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath385 , and then , in order to achieve a consistent picture we have to take @xmath421 for any finite @xmath6 . therefore , the solitons ( [ conexsol ] ) and ( [ conshsol ] ) can be expanded as @xmath422 where @xmath423 is higher order terms which are very small compared to @xmath424 given in ( [ conemet ] ) .",
    "hence , in both cases the solitons are invertible , positive definite , and correspondingly , we have well - defined theory for all @xmath8 .",
    "further analysis confirms that there is no parity transformation of the hessian matrix of ( [ v1 ] ) that changes the morse index of minkowskian ground states .",
    "now we turn our attention to discuss nondegenerate ads vacuum . in this case",
    ", supersymmetry further requires @xmath425 for @xmath54 , which follows that the ground state also depends on @xmath6 , namely @xmath426 with non zero scalar potential @xmath427 where the khler potential @xmath71 is given in ( [ u1conex ] ) , while for @xmath10 the function @xmath394 is replaced by @xmath406 .",
    "however , in the case at hand , since we have cone dominating metric , only static ads vacuum leads the term in ( [ susycongkr ] ) and further , @xmath428 for any @xmath429 in this asymptotic region .",
    "in addition , it is impossible to find a vacuum @xmath430 defined by the critical points of @xmath154 as in the khler  einstein case in which the @xmath97-connection in ( [ u1conex ] ) evaluated at @xmath430 vanishes .    for degenerate cases , both minkowskian and ads",
    "vacua reach the same results , namely the parity transformation of the hessian matrix of ( [ v1 ] ) caused by the soliton does not emerge because the static cone metric @xmath431 is the leading term .",
    "hence , we obtain similar results as in the previous case .",
    "similar as in the preceding section , the next step is to check the existence of such ads vacua using ( [ beta1 ] ) describing the first - order expansion of the beta function ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "for example , in the model where all spin-@xmath220 fermions are massless , all ads vacua live in the uv region because all the eigenvalues of ( [ beta1 ] ) are positive .",
    "moreover , such a model admits only unstable walls because only negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of ( [ v1])survive .",
    "finally , we conclude all results by the following theorem .    [ section ]    [ dinmorselemma ] consider @xmath0 chiral supersymmetry on @xmath332 symmetric khler ",
    "ricci soliton ( [ krsol ] ) in asymptotic region satisfying ( [ conedominance ] ) .",
    "suppose there exists an @xmath230-dimensional vacuum manifold @xmath234 of the theory with the index @xmath167 in the ir or uv regions .",
    "then , in the normal direction of @xmath234 , we can introduce real local coordinates @xmath432 with @xmath433 for all @xmath29 and finite @xmath6 such  that @xmath434 thus , no parity transformation of the hessian matrix of ( [ v11 ] ) emerges caused by the khler  ricci soliton in the region .",
    "so far we have discussed the properties of four - dimensional chiral @xmath0 supersymmetry on khler ",
    "ricci flow satisfying ( [ krf ] ) . both in global and local theories ,",
    "all couplings deform with respect to the parameter @xmath6 which is related to the dynamics of the khler metric . then",
    ", flat bps domain walls of @xmath0 supergravity have been constructed where the warped factor ( [ warp ] ) and the supersymmetric flows are described by the bps equations ( [ gfe ] ) and the beta function ( [ beta ] ) is controlled by the holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 and the geometric flow ( [ krf ] ) .",
    "we have considered the case where the initial manifold is khler ",
    "einstein with @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , in the interval @xmath8 , the flow collapses to a point at @xmath9 and both @xmath0 theories diverge .",
    "such singularity disjoints two different theories , namely in @xmath435 we have @xmath0 theories on a khler  einstein manifold with @xmath7 , whereas for @xmath82 the case turns out to be @xmath0 theories on another khler  einstein manifold with @xmath13 and metric signature . in the latter model",
    "we have wrong - sign kinetic term which might be considered as ghosts .",
    "in global theory , such geometrical deformation affects the vacua , which can be directly seen from the parity transformation of the hessian matrix ( [ hessv ] ) that changes the morse index of the vacua if they are nondegenerate .",
    "the same conclusion is achieved for nondegenerate minkowskian vacua in the local theory .",
    "these are written in theorem  [ modmorselemma ] .    in ads",
    "vacua , it is not trivial to observe directly such phenomenon since both the geometric flow ( [ krf ] ) and the coupling quantities such as the holomorphic superpotential @xmath154 and the fermionic mass in ( [ fermass1 ] ) generally determine the properties of the vacua in the second - order analysis",
    ". therefore , we had to impose the conditions ( [ mirrorcon ] ) in order for the parity transformation to be revealed in both the nondegenerate and degenerate cases described by theorem [ lemmavmorse1 ] and theorem [ lemmavmorse2 ] , respectively . particularly in the degenerate case we had another possibility that the khler  ricci flow could also change an @xmath263-dimensional vacuum manifold to another @xmath230-dimensional vacuum manifold with @xmath267 as mentioned in theorem [ lemmavmorse3 ] .",
    "finally , we have employed the rg flow analysis to verify the existence of the vacua since they correspond to the three dimensional  cft .",
    "then , we gave an explicit model , namely , the @xmath436 model with linear superpotential @xmath437 .",
    "in the model , we obtain a static vacuum @xmath296 with @xmath297 . for @xmath299 ,",
    "the vacuum is an isolated ads spacetime of the index @xmath222 describing unstable walls for @xmath438 . in the interval @xmath439",
    ", the index then changes to @xmath223 and it corresponds to stable walls .",
    "all of them live in the uv region ensured by ( [ beta2 ] ) . on the other side , taking @xmath302 for any @xmath61 the vacua become degenerate minkowskian spacetime .",
    "hence , the vacuum manifold is @xmath440 for @xmath441 and then turns into @xmath293 for  @xmath442 .    for dynamical ads",
    "vacua , we easily take @xmath304 . before singularity , namely @xmath443 ,",
    "there are local minimum , local maximum , saddle , and degenerate vacua living in the uv region given by ( [ locmin ] ) to ( [ degtau ] ) , whereas in the ir region we have only local minimum , saddle , and nonintrinsic degenerate vacua .",
    "this evidence shows that the khler ",
    "ricci flow indeed plays a role in changing the dimension and the index of the vacua consistent with the first point in theorem [ lemmavmorse3 ] .",
    "similar phenomenon happens after singularity , namely @xmath444 .",
    "the uv region allows all possibilities of vacua , but in the ir region there are only local maximum , saddle , and again , nonintrinsic degenerate vacua .",
    "these are the facts of the second point intheorem  [ lemmavmorse3 ] .",
    "the second example is the @xmath332 invariant soliton . around @xmath372",
    "the soliton becomes @xmath333 , which is a khler ",
    "einstein manifold mentioned above .",
    "therefore , our interest is in asymptotic region @xmath385 . again , for @xmath7 , the singularity occurs at @xmath9 and the soliton converges to a khler cone . additionally , the soliton has positive definite metric for @xmath8 demanded by the inequalities  ( [ inequal ] ) .",
    "moreover , in order to get a consistent picture we have to choose @xmath445 for any finite @xmath6 .",
    "then , in the region the soliton is dominated by the cone metric ( [ conemet ] ) and has positive definite for all @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , all vacua are static and correspondingly , do not posses parity transformation of the hessian matrix of the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) caused by the geometric flow ( [ conexsol ] ) and ( [ conshsol ] ) .",
    "the same step as in the previous case , in ads vacua the analysis using rg flow must be performed for proving the existence of such vacua . as an example , in a model consisting of all massless spin-@xmath220 fermions , all ads vacua exist in the uv region .    finally , we want to mention that the analysis here can be generalized to a case of curved bps domain walls .",

    "first of all , we define the hessian matrix of the scalar potential ( [ v1 ] ) in local theory  as @xmath455 where @xmath456 is a critical point ( vacuum ) and @xmath457 , around which the scalar potential can be expanded  as @xmath458 with @xmath459 , and we have defined real coordinates such that @xmath460 and @xmath461 .",

    "therefore , the expansion ( [ vgen ] ) becomes @xmath465 with @xmath466 .",
    "since @xmath467 , we can define a new coordinate @xmath468  as @xmath469 and then , ( [ vgenke ] ) can be expressed as @xmath470 therefore , we inductively carry on the computation until @xmath471 by defining @xmath472 so that ( [ vgenke ] ) has the form @xmath473 where @xmath474 this completes the induction and the proof of theorem [ lemmavmorse1 ]",
