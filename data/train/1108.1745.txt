    "a key issue in studying in - medium @xmath0 meson interactions concerns the strength of the attractive @xmath0 nuclear potential @xcite .",
    "related topical questions involve ( i ) the underlying free - space @xmath8 interaction and whether or not it can realistically support @xmath0 nuclear clusters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , and ( ii ) the role of @xmath0 mesons in multistrange self - bound matter @xcite and in compact stars @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the nuclear potential @xmath9 is provided by the leading - order ( lo ) tomozawa - weinberg ( tw ) vector term of the chiral effective meson - baryon lagrangian @xcite which in the born approximation gives @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the nuclear density , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "this attraction is doubled , roughly , within chirally based coupled - channel @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15 calculations that produce dynamically a @xmath13 quasibound state loosely identified with the @xmath16 resonance @xcite .",
    "deeper potentials , in the range @xmath17(150200 ) mev are obtained in comprehensive global fits to @xmath0-atom strong - interaction shifts and widths by introducing empirical density dependent effective @xmath18 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "such strongly attractive potentials are expected to generate @xmath0 nuclear quasibound states which could prove relatively narrow once the strong transition @xmath19 becomes kinematically forbidden for binding energies exceeding about 100 mev , as conjectured by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "experimentally , we mention the @xmath0 quasibound signals claimed for @xmath20 @xcite at and below the @xmath21 threshold .",
    "however , these reported signals are quite broad , at variance with the underlying physics .",
    "in contrast to the indications of a deep @xmath0 potential , considerably shallower potentials , @xmath17(4060 ) mev , are obtained for zero kinetic - energy kaons by introducing self energy ( se ) contributions to the in - medium @xmath22 threshold scattering amplitude , within a self - consistent procedure that includes in particular the potential @xmath9 thus generated @xcite .    in a recent letter @xcite we reported on new , self consistent calculations of @xmath0 quasibound states that lead to deep @xmath0 nuclear potentials , considerably deeper than the ` shallow ' potentials deduced in refs .",
    "the basic idea is to identify the @xmath18 _ subthreshold _ energy domain required for the construction of @xmath9 . for kaonic atoms , essentially at the @xmath0 nuclear threshold , this was explored during the 1970s by wycech @xcite , bardeen and torigoe @xcite and rook @xcite who noted the dominance of the subthreshold @xmath13 quasibound state @xmath16 in causing the in - medium @xmath13 scattering amplitude to become more attractive as one goes to subthreshold @xmath18 energies . in our letter",
    "@xcite we applied this idea , introducing a new self consistency requirement , to a comprehensive study of kaonic atoms that uses scattering amplitudes derived from a chirally motivated coupled channel meson - baryon lagrangian @xcite . here",
    "we expand on these recent calculations to provide more details on derivation , systematics and results .",
    "in addition to the next to leading - order ( nlo ) model cs30 used in the letter , in the present work we report on a new lo model tw1 fitted to the new siddharta values of shift and width of the @xmath23 state in the @xmath0 hydrogen atom @xcite . the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : self ] we describe a self consistent scheme of handling in - medium subthreshold @xmath18 scattering amplitudes used in the construction of @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the derivation of in - medium scattering amplitudes in both models tw1 and cs30 .",
    "some details are relegated to an appendix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : atoms ] we discuss kaonic atom calculations , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : bound ] we discuss calculations of @xmath0 nuclear quasibound states . sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] concludes the work with a brief summary of the main results .",
    "in the single - nucleon approximation , the @xmath0 potential in nuclear matter of density @xmath4 is given in terms of the in - medium @xmath18 scattering amplitude @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 reduces to the free - space two - body @xmath18 c.m .",
    "forward scattering amplitude @xmath27 and the nucleon energy @xmath28 is approximated by its mass @xmath29 in the kinematical factor in front of @xmath24 . here , @xmath30 is the relative @xmath18 momentum and @xmath31 is the lorentz invariant mandelstam variable @xmath2 which reduces to the square of the total @xmath18 energy in the two - body c.m .",
    "frame . in the laboratory frame , @xmath32 . before constructing @xmath9 for use in actual calculations ,",
    "we need to prescribe how to interpret in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) the two - body arguments @xmath30 and @xmath33 of the in - medium scattering amplitude . for @xmath2-wave amplitudes ,",
    "the momentum dependence arises through the magnitude @xmath7 of the relative momentum @xmath30 which near threshold is approximated by @xmath34 averaging over angles , the square of @xmath30 assumes the form @xmath35 for @xmath33 we note that @xmath36 in the two - body c.m .",
    "system , but @xmath37 in the nuclear laboratory system which nearly coincides with the @xmath0nucleus c.m . system .",
    "averaging over angles yields @xmath38 . near threshold , neglecting quadratic terms in the binding energies @xmath39 , @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 . to transform the momentum dependence into density dependence ,",
    "the nucleon kinetic energy @xmath43 is approximated in the fermi gas model by @xmath44 , with @xmath45 mev , and the @xmath0 kinetic energy @xmath46 is identified in the local density approximation with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the @xmath0 finite - size coulomb potential . under these approximations ,",

    "are positive for attractive @xmath9 , and @xmath51 ( in mev ) , where _ all _ the terms following @xmath52 on the r.h.s .",
    "are negative , thus implementing the anticipated downward energy shift into the @xmath18 subthreshold energy region .",
    "( [ eq : sfinal ] ) is used in most of the bound state applications below as is , although we also checked the effect of implementing gauge invariance through the substitution @xmath53 .",
    "gauge invariance often is not implemented in the solution of the free - space lippmann - schwinger equations of underlying chiral models simply because its effects on the two - body meson - baryon system are negligible .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 nuclear potential @xmath9 appears as an argument in expressions ( [ eq : p^2final ] ) and ( [ eq : sfinal ] ) for @xmath54 and @xmath33 , respectively , which in turn serve as arguments in expression ( [ eq : t ] ) for this same @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests to calculate @xmath9 self consistently within a scheme in which the downward energy shift into the @xmath18 subthreshold energy region is density dependent and is controlled by the outcome self - consistent @xmath55 . in the corresponding sections below we",
    "elaborate on the self consistency scheme which is applied to the solution of the wave equation satisfied by in - medium @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the synergy of chiral perturbation theory and coupled channel @xmath56-matrix resummation techniques provides successful description of @xmath57 interactions at low energies @xcite . in our approach",
    "we employ chirally motivated coupled - channel @xmath2-wave potentials that are taken in a separable form , @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denoting baryon energy , baryon mass and meson energy in the c.m .",

    "the coupling matrix @xmath63 is determined by chiral su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 mev represents the pseudoscalar - meson decay constant in the chiral limit , and the inverse range parameters @xmath65 are fitted to the low energy @xmath57 data .",

    "we summarize its essential points with emphasis on in - medium modifications .",

    "the exact content of the matrix elements up to second order in the meson c.m .",
    "kinetic energies was specified already in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    ", one often considers only the leading order tw interaction @xcite with energy dependence given by @xmath70 the structure constants @xmath71 are listed in ref .",
    "we note that this relativistic prescription differs from the one adopted in models derived from a chiral lagrangian formulation for static baryons @xcite and expanded strictly only to second order in meson energies and quark masses . there ,",
    "the energy dependence form @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath73 where the primed meson energies @xmath74 include a relativistic correction : @xmath75 , with @xmath76 denoting the meson mass in channel @xmath66 and where @xmath77 is the baryon mass in the chiral limit . in principle , approaches based on different formulations of the chiral lagrangian should give identical results for physical observables .",
    "however , this is true only when one sums up an infinite series of relevant feynman diagrams to all orders in @xmath78 , and need not hold at a given perturbative order .",
    "in other words , models based on different lagrangian formulations , or models that differ from each other in prescribing how to treat terms beyond leading order , may give within reasonable limits different predictions for physical observables .",
    "the scattering amplitudes corresponding to the separable potentials ( [ eq : vpot ] ) are also of a separable form @xmath79 with the same form factors @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and where the _ reduced _ scattering amplitude @xmath82 is given explicitly by @xmath83_{ij}\\;.   \\label{eq : ampl}\\ ] ] here the meson - baryon propagator @xmath84 is diagonal in the channel indices @xmath62 and @xmath66 .",
    "when the elementary @xmath57 system is submerged in the nuclear medium one has to consider pauli blocking and self energies ( se ) generated by the interactions of mesons and baryons with the medium .",
    "thus , the propagator @xmath84 and the reduced amplitudes @xmath85 become dependent on the nuclear density @xmath4 .",
    "the intermediate state green s function is calculated as @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the on - shell c.m .",
    "momentum in channel @xmath62 and the integration domain @xmath88 is limited by the pauli principle in the @xmath57 channels .",
    "included in the denominator of the green s function ( [ eq : green ] ) is the sum @xmath89 of meson and baryon self energies in channel @xmath62 .",
    "in particular the kaon se @xmath90 , which serves as input in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) and therefore also in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) for the output reduced amplitude @xmath91 , requires by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) the knowledge of this same output @xmath91 .",
    "this calls for a _ self consistent _ solution of the in - medium reduced scattering amplitudes @xmath92 as was first suggested by lutz @xcite .",
    "in the present calculation , following ref .",
    "@xcite , the baryon and pion self energies were approximated by momentum independent potentials @xmath93 with real and imaginary parts of @xmath94 chosen consistently from mean - field potentials used in nuclear structure calculations and in scattering calculations , respectively .",
    "specifically , we adopted @xmath95 mev , @xmath96 mev , @xmath97 mev and @xmath98 mev .",
    "the free parameters of the separable - interaction chiral models considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work were fitted to the available experimental data on low energy @xmath57 interactions , consisting of @xmath99 low - energy cross sections for elastic scattering and reactions to the @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 channels ( as listed in ref .",
    "in addition , the accurately determined @xmath99 threshold branching ratios @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 @xcite provide a rather strict test for any quantitative model .",
    "another stringent test is provided by the recent siddharta measured values @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the @xmath0hydrogen atom @xmath23 level shift and width @xcite .    .@xmath110 threshold observables calculated in several free - space lo coupled - channel chiral models",
    ". the @xmath0hydrogen atom @xmath23 shift @xmath108 and width @xmath109 ( in ev ) marked by asterisks were obtained from the calculated @xmath111 scattering length by means of a modified deser - trueman relation @xcite and are compared to the siddharta measured values @xcite . the @xmath110 threshold branching ratios @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 are from ref .",
    "the last two columns list the calculated @xmath112 @xmath113-matrix pole positions @xmath114 ( in mev ) on the [ @xmath115 second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : bound3 ]    table  [ tab : bound3 ] presents binding energies and widths of @xmath23 @xmath0 nuclear quasibound states in several nuclei across the periodic table , calculated self - consistently within in - medium versions of cs30 chiral amplitudes .",
    "the first two sequences denoted [ wh ] and @xmath33 illustrate the role of subthreshold @xmath33 extrapolation which affects particularly the widths @xmath116 , in a similar pattern to that already shown for the tw1 model in table  [ tab : bound2 ] .",
    "the next three sequences exhibit the effects of successively sophisticating the calculations : first , the in - medium ` no se ' amplitudes are dressed by self energies ( denoted ` + se ' ) , bringing the calculated widths further down ( and marginally so the binding energies ) ; then , the calculations are made dynamical ( denoted ` + dyn . ' ) taking into account the polarization of the nuclear core by the strongly bound @xmath0 , which produces higher binding energies @xmath117 and smaller widths @xmath116 ; and last , energy dependent imaginary @xmath118 terms are added self consistently to simulate two - nucleon @xmath119 absorption modes ( denoted ` + 2n abs . ' ) and their available phase space @xcite . whereas the binding energies decrease insignificantly , the resulting widths of order @xmath120  mev become comparable in light nuclei to the binding energies @xmath117 .",
    "in this work we have used several versions of in - medium @xmath13 scattering amplitudes constructed in a chirally motivated coupled channel separable potential model to derive self - consistently the @xmath0 nuclear potential for several bound state applications .",
    "the @xmath13 scattering amplitudes exhibit , invariably , a strong energy and density dependence below threshold , which reflects the dominant effect of the @xmath16 subthreshold resonance .",
    "this is precisely the energy region relevant for the self consistent construction of @xmath9 for kaonic atoms and for @xmath0 nuclear quasibound state calculations .",
    "it was found that kaonic atoms probe @xmath13 c.m .",
    "energies typically 3050 mev below threshold whereas @xmath0 nuclear @xmath23 quasibound states reach considerably lower @xmath13 subthreshold energies .",
    "thus , the chiral model versions used in the present work produced potential depths in the range @xmath121  8090 mev in kaonic atoms , and somewhat deeper potentials of depths 100110  mev for @xmath0 nuclear quasibound states . by comparing the size and shape of our subthreshold @xmath13 scattering amplitudes with those of other chiral models , as discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect these results to hold generally in any coupled - channel chiral model constrained by low energy @xmath110 data once our self consistency construction is applied .",
    "the density dependence of the resulting kaonic atom potentials is such that by adding adjustable phenomenological terms to be determined by fits to the data , the real part of the potential becomes twice as deep and the imaginary part about three times as deep due to a @xmath118dominated complex term which could represent @xmath122 dispersive and absorptive modifications .",
    "these substantial modifications at full nuclear density represent extrapolations from the nuclear surface region to which kaonic atoms are mostly sensitive and where such modifications appear more modest .",
    "more work is needed to explain the origin and test the existence of the sizable @xmath118 term . finally , the effects of a @xmath7-wave interaction generated by the @xmath123 subthreshold resonance are found secondary to the effects of the @xmath2-wave interaction which is dominated by the @xmath16 subthreshold resonance .",

    "202/09/1441 , as well as by the eu initiative fp7 , hadronphysics2 , under project no .",
    "the observed properties of in - medium @xmath57 interaction may be related to the dynamics of the @xmath16 resonance in the nuclear medium .",
    "this is demonstrated for model tw1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles1 ] which shows the motion in the complex energy plane of poles related to the @xmath14 and @xmath57 channels upon increasing the nuclear density , including pauli blocking but disregarding self energy insertions .",
    "the lower half of the energy plane , below the real axis , corresponds to the [ @xmath115 riemann sheet standardly referred to as the second riemann sheet and accessed from the physical region by crossing the real energy axis in between the @xmath124 and @xmath57 thresholds .",
    "the upper half of the energy plane ( above the real axis ) shows the [ @xmath125 riemann sheet , the third riemann sheet , which does not allow for @xmath57 quasibound interpretation of poles located therein .",
    "the pole trajectories shown in the figure were calculated from the free - space pole positions ( encircled dots ) up to the pole positions at full nuclear density @xmath126 .",
    "in addition to the two @xmath112 poles listed and discussed in table  [ tab : models ] of the main text , each of the decoupled @xmath14 and @xmath57 channels also exhibits an @xmath127 pole , the one related to @xmath57 developing into a resonance residing on the [ @xmath125 riemann sheet and another one related to a @xmath14 state residing on the [ @xmath115 riemann sheet .",
    "while the @xmath127 pole related to @xmath14 lies too far from the real energy axis to affect any physical observable , the one related to @xmath57 is responsible for the peak structure in the real part of the @xmath128 amplitude near threshold .",
    "however , the riemann sheet location of this pole denies it of any quasibound interpretation .",
    "the @xmath127 poles persist also in the more involved nlo chiral models discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as expected , the nuclear medium has no significant impact on the position of poles related to the @xmath14 channel . on the other hand , both poles related to the @xmath57 channel move to considerably higher energies as the density increases .",
    "the @xmath112 @xmath57 pole that affects most the @xmath57 scattering amplitude moves as high as about 1475 mev , almost reaching the real energy axis .",
    "since the pole is relatively far from the physical region due to the @xmath57 branch cut , the scattering amplitude exhibits a cusp instead of a proper resonance structure ( see the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : akp1 ] of the main text ) . when kaon self energy is implemented the pole moves back below the @xmath57 threshold , residing now in the [ @xmath125 riemann sheet .",
    "since it remains relatively far from the physical region , one again gets a cusp structure as exhibited by the solid line in fig .",
