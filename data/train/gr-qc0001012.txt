    "the existence of very rich , integrable structure of einstein equations , at least for space - times with two - dimensional abelian isometry groups , have been conjectured by different authors many years ago , but the real discoveries of beautiful integrability properties of these equations and effective procedures for construction of their solutions have been started more than twenty years ago in the papers of belinskii and zakharov @xcite . in these papers",
    "the inverse scattering methods have been developed for einstein equations for vacuum gravitational fields .",
    "in particular , the solution of the entire problem had been reduced to some matrix riemann - hilbert problem and soliton generating ( dressing ) technique had been suggested for calculation of vacuum gravitational solitons on an arbitrary chosen ( vacuum ) background . later numerous investigations of integrable reductions of einstein equations ( for vacuum or in the presence of electromagnetic and some other matter fields ) have been made by many authors , using different powerful ideas of the modern theory of completely integrable systems .",
    "a number of different more or less general approaches were developed and many other interesting results were obtained .    here we consider belinskii and zakharov vacuum soliton generating transformations in the context of so called `` monodromy transform '' approach .",
    "this approach , developed by the author in @xcite - @xcite , provides some general base for the analysis of all known integrable reductions of einstein equations . in this approach any local solution of reduced einstein equations is characterized by a set of monodromy data of the fundamental solution of some associated spectral problem . , which is covered twice by the belinskii and zakharov spectral plane @xmath0 , and different spectral problem ( first constructed by kinnersley and chitre @xcite in the context of their group - theoretic approach ) , which is gauge equivalent to the belinskii and zakharov one .",
    "the reason for the first difference is the absence of differentiation in the transformed linear system with respect to a spectral parameter @xmath1 , and for the second one - the simplest monodromy properties of solutions on this spectral plane . ]",
    "the direct and inverse problems of such monodromy transform possess unambiguous solutions .",
    "it is remarkable , that many physical and geometrical properties of the solutions can be expressed directly in terms of the analytical structure of these monodromy data on the spectral plane .",
    "a lot of the known physically interesting solutions possess very simple , rational structures of these monodromy data functions .",
    "as it will be shown below , it is also convenient to characterize the belinskii and zakharov vacuum soliton generating procedure in terms of the corresponding transformation of the monodromy data of the background solution into the monodromy data of the ( multi- ) soliton solution .",
    "these transformations possess an explicit and remarkably simple , linear - fractional form with coefficients , polynomial in the spectral parameter of the orders less or equal to a number of solitons .",
    "this allows to calculate various physical parameters of the generating soliton solutions without ( or before ) their complete calculation .",
    "a generalization of these transformations for the case of electrovacuum solitons , found in @xcite , is also presented .",
