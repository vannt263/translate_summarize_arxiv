    "<S> many experiments on high - temperature superconductors have shown paramagnetic behavior when the sample is field cooled . </S>",
    "<S> the paramagnetism was first attributed to a @xmath0-wave order parameter creating @xmath1-junctions in the samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same effect was later discovered in traditional low - temperature superconductors and conventional josephson - junction arrays which are @xmath2-wave . by simulating _ both _ conventional and mixed @xmath1/conventional josephson - junction arrays </S>",
    "<S> we determine that differences exist which may be sufficient to clearly identify the presence ( or absence ) of @xmath1-junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the @xmath1-junctions cause a symmetry breaking providing a measurable signature of their presence in sample .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> a significant discussion in the superconductivity field was devoted to the paramagnetic response in field - cooled samples , the so - called paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pme was first observed in high-@xmath3 ceramic materials @xcite and then also in low @xmath3 samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism to explain the effect was introduced by sigrist and rice @xcite where pme was due to the presence of @xmath1-junctions in the multiple - connected network of junctions formed by the superconducting grains in the high-@xmath3 ceramic . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1-junctions are josephson junctions formed between superconductors with unconventional pairing which cause a @xmath1 shift in the phase - current relation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . unconventional pairing , such as a @xmath0-wave order parameter , was introduced to explain the properties of high - t@xmath4 ceramic materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pme was taken as strong evidence for a @xmath0-wave order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiple - connectiveness and @xmath1-junctions were soon shown to give a paramagnetic response in simulated josephson junction arrays by dominguez , jagla and balseiro @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of pme in conventional low-@xmath3 ( ltc ) samples shows that pme can not always be attributed to @xmath1-junction because they are present only in @xmath0-wave superconductors ( or in unconventional superconductor - ferromagnet systems @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> new explanations such as a giant flux state @xcite , flux compression @xcite and surface states @xcite have been introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the common feature was that pme in ltc samples is described as non - equilibrium phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently a new experiment was devised to test the connection between multi - connectiveness and pme in conventional systems . </S>",
    "<S> a square array of ltc junctions was field cooled and shown to be predominantly paramagnetic @xcite ; this paper also proposed a qualitative explanation for the effect . </S>",
    "<S> a subsequent analysis performed by numerical simulations of the arrays confirmed the presence of pme in ltc arrays @xcite . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> the essential ingredients of pme appears to be multiple - connectiveness rather than the presence of @xmath1-junction or non - equilibrium effects .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that simulated josephson - junction arrays both with@xcite and without @xcite @xmath1-junctions show pme . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate by means of numerical simulations the differences between the two cases and the true role of the @xmath1-junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest an experimental signature of the presence of @xmath1-junctions in field - cooled array samples .    </S>",
    "<S> the array is described by means of a full mutual inductance model similar to that used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is the presence of some @xmath1-junction , i.e. , josephson junctions where supercurrent is proportioinal to @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamics of an nxn array are described by the following equations@xcite :    @xmath7    here time is normalized to a cell frequency ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 the self inductance of the elementary loops formed of the array @xmath10 the junction capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is the stewart - mccumber parameter , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ( mean ) josephson critical current for the junctions in the array , @xmath14 is the flux quantum and @xmath15 is the junction conductance . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath18 represents the normalized loop magnetization ( in unit of @xmath14 ) which depends on frustation @xmath19 , phase vector @xmath20 and the initial distribution of flux quanta in the array loops @xmath21 , here choosen to be a random integer vector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the matrixes carrying the mutual inductance coupling . </S>",

    "<S> in particular we choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in both experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and previous simulations @xcite it was shown that multiple - connectiveness effects are dominant for large field , i.e. , for large values of frustation @xmath19 . to understand the effect of the @xmath1-shift we studied smaller values of frustation @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> . in this region the behavior of an array without disorder and with all normal or all @xmath1-junctions roughly follows the single loop behavior @xcitewhich is described by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total flux throught the loop . </S>",
    "<S> solution of eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) describe a single loop made by four conventional josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> there are four independent solutions which are obtained varying the integer @xmath35 from zero to three . </S>",
    "<S> the ( stable ) lowest gibbs energy state is diamagnetic for @xmath36 , i.e. , the loop current is negative , generating a magnetic moment opposite to the external field , and paramagnetic for @xmath37 , i.e. , the loop current is positive @xcite . on the other hand if @xmath38 the @xmath1-shift will reverse the behavior : for the @xmath1-loop ( a loop with an _ odd _ number of @xmath1-junctions ) the lowest gibbs energy state is paramagnetic for @xmath36 and diamagnetic for @xmath37 .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we showed that conventional - array behavior can be qualitatively understood in terms of a model based on the single - loop behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we found that each loop in the array had a magnetization that was close to one of the lowest energy solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for the isolated loop , with the number of loops of each type determining the overall magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this simple picture also works for arrays with both conventional and @xmath1-junctions , with the number of possible solutions being increased because that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) has additional solutions for the @xmath1-loops .    in order to compare conventional arrays with mixed conventional/@xmath1 arrays </S>",
    "<S> , we first simulate the conventional arrays using the method of ref . @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a the magnetization of a @xmath39 conventional array with @xmath40 is shown . </S>",
    "<S> there are two single - loop magnetization states with a predominancy of diamagnetic states ( light gray ) over which a set of paramagnetic loops ( dark gray ) are randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> the histogram of loop magnetizations is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a and shows clearly only two peaks corresponding to two loop magnetizations . </S>",
    "<S> the mean magnetization is negative and small as expected for such small values of frustation accordingly to the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for the single loop ; the exact value is @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> as said above the values of the single peak averages can be obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) ; the small spread of the peaks is due to mutual inductance coupling .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b a similar @xmath39 array with @xmath40 is shown in which @xmath42 @xmath1-junctions have been introduced at random . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to a concentration of @xmath1-junctions of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with the case of coventional array is the presence of four magnetization states , two for each type of loop . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the new @xmath1-loop states are predominantly paramagnetic according to the symmetry shift discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with the lower number of conventional loops , is causing the reversal of the mean magnetization ( here being @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the way in which a mixed array becomes paramagnetic for low values of frustation . </S>",
    "<S> lower concentrations will make the array diamagnetic ( i.e. the dependence on concentration is similar to that reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a 3d system ) . for other values of @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> we note that the single loop symmetry is broken , i.e. , for @xmath45 the array can be diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending on the distribution and number of @xmath1-loops .    from the preceding discussion , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there are at best only subtle differences between a conventional array and an array containing a mixture of conventional and @xmath1-junctions . in the remainder of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we will show that when @xmath46 these differences are the most pronounced , and therefore @xmath46 is probably the best place to look experimentally in searching for evidence of @xmath1-junctions in non zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath46 the problem is simplified by the fact that the four lowest states shrink to three because the @xmath1-loop magnetization becomes zero . </S>",
    "<S> so one is confronted with only three peaks which are symmetrically distributed around the zero magnetization . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a this case is shown in a magnetization histogram . </S>",
    "<S> the central peak is the zero magnetization of @xmath1-loops and two symmetric lateral peaks are due to coventional loops . </S>",
    "<S> symmetrical histogram structure is an optimal `` signature '' , it is easily recognized with ssm and statistical filtering or image filtering techniques can be applied knowing the true distribution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the central peak intensity is related to presence of @xmath1-loops . at @xmath47 ( @xmath48 @xmath1-junctions ) </S>",
    "<S> it becomes thinner preserving the same height . </S>",
    "<S> then it decreases by about 10% at @xmath49 ( @xmath50 @xmath1-junctions ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally at @xmath51 ( @xmath52 @xmath1-junctions ) it decreases of about 60% .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a a weak gaussian disorder with a standard deviation of @xmath53 was introduced in the critical currents of the arrays similarly to ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was added to shown that weak disorder does not change the three - peak structure of the magnetization histogram . for high values of the parameter </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 the nature of the magnetization states is discrete and this is preserved for weak disorder in the currents . </S>",
    "<S> peak structure exists also with stronger disorder in the critical currents . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b we set @xmath54@xcite we see peaks enlarging until the tails of the single three distributions overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the remaining discrete structure is due again to the large @xmath16 loops . </S>",
    "<S> also we have simulated the array with the same parameters of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b using a mean value of @xmath55 for the @xmath1-junction critical current . </S>",
    "<S> the result is again similar to fig . 4b but </S>",
    "<S> that central peak is lowered by roughly 13% and the histogram appears more enlarged .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we would stress again how both conventional and mixed conventional/@xmath1 arrays show a similar response when field - cooled . </S>",
    "<S> this response is related to the single loop solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . in low field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 paramagnetism in mixed conventional/@xmath1 arrays is the result of the paramagnetic behavior of @xmath1-loops . to quantify this effect for a disorderd system </S>",
    "<S> is difficult because it depends on distribution and number of @xmath1-loops . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> a noteworthy point is @xmath46 . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-loops sets to zero current so it is possible from a measurement of the magnetization histogram to trace back the presence of @xmath1-loops in the sample . for high - t@xmath4 materials this experiment can be an important complement of the search for spontaneous currents in zero field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath46 would be of great interest permitting to estimate the @xmath1-loops content of the sample .    </S>",
