    "the proton electromagnetic form factors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , provide important information on the substructure of the proton .",
    "several decades worth of elastic electron - proton scattering measurements have provided measurements of the proton form factors via the rosenbluth separation technique . up to several gev@xmath3 ,",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 approximately follow the dipole form , and hence @xmath6 .",
    "however , at large @xmath0 values , the cross section is dominated by @xmath5 , and so extractions of @xmath4 are of limited precision . because of this , data above 2  gev@xmath3 are quite sensitive to systematic uncertainties in the cross section measurements , and there are no direct extractions of @xmath4 above @xmath7  gev@xmath3 .",
    "the polarization transfer technique provides a direct measurement of @xmath8 , with significantly reduced systematic uncertainties at large @xmath0 values .",
    "recent polarization measurements indicate that @xmath4 falls more rapidly than @xmath5 as @xmath0 increases  @xcite , with @xmath9 this significant falloff of the form factor ratio disagreements with the rosenbluth extractions of @xmath8 .",
    "while the uncertainties in the rosenbluth extraction of @xmath4 grows rapidly with @xmath0 , they are not large enough to allow for consistency with the polarization transfer measurements  @xcite .",
    "until it is resolved , the discrepancy between the form factors extracted using these two techniques implies a large uncertainty in the proton form factors .",
    "not only does this impact our knowledge of the proton structure , it also has significant implications for many other experiments .",
    "if either the rosenbluth or polarization transfer technique is incorrect , it may imply similar problems for other experiments using these techniques .",
    "the problem could also lie in the cross section data that goes into the rosenbluth extractions .",
    "the cross section data would have to have a significant @xmath10-dependent error , 58% for @xmath11  gev@xmath3 , to explain the discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "because the elastic cross section has routinely been used as a check on the normalization of electron scattering experiments , this may lead to questions about several other experimental results . for quasielastic @xmath12 measurements , precise information on the elastic electron - proton scattering",
    "is even more important , as it is assumed that the electron - proton cross section is well known when extracting information on nuclear structure .",
    "the cross sections one obtains from polarization transfer fits to the form factors can differ significantly from those using rosenbluth form factors  @xcite .",
    "fits that include the polarization transfer data yield cross sections that are a few percent larger than the measured cross sections at low @xmath10 , and a few percent smaller at large @xmath10 .",
    "combining inconsistent form factors can yield even larger discrepancies : combining @xmath5 from rosenbluth measurements with @xmath8 from polarization transfer yields cross sections that are 510% too low at large @xmath10 for @xmath13  gev@xmath3 .",
    "it is crucial that we understand the discrepancy , not only to be sure of the proton form factors , but also because precise knowledge of the cross section is important to many electron scattering experiments .",
    "because the difference in the form factors has the largest impact on the @xmath10-dependence of the cross sections , the uncertainty is significantly enhanced for experiments which examine the longitudinal and transverse response in quasielastic scattering .",
    "jlab experiment e91 - 013  @xcite performed a rosenbluth separation of the response function for carbon at @xmath14 and 1.8  gev@xmath3 . at low @xmath0",
    ", they found an excess of strength in the transverse response function , which they attribute to many - body currents . at @xmath15  gev@xmath3",
    ", they find identical transverse and longitudinal response functions if they use rosenbluth form factors in their analysis , but find that the longitudinal response is @xmath1660% larger than the transverse if they assume form factors extracted from polarization transfer measurements .",
    "clearly , these data can not be properly interpreted unless we know the appropriate form factors to use in such an analysis .",
    "the goal of jlab experiment e01 - 001 was to check the consistency of rosenbluth and polarization transfer measurements by performing a high - precision rosenbluth extraction of @xmath8 , with significantly reduced statistical and systematic uncertainties compared to previous rosenbluth separations .",
    "normally , one measures the elastic cross section at fixed @xmath0 , but varies @xmath10 by simultaneously varying the beam energy and electron scattering angle .",
    "any corrections that depend on the beam energy or the scattering angle are translated into @xmath10-dependent corrections , which can potentially change the extracted form factors .",
    "varying @xmath10 also implies a significant variation in the energy of the detected electron the the elastic cross section , which can vary by two or more orders of magnitude over the @xmath10 range measured .",
    "thus , any momentum - dependent or rate - dependent corrections are also @xmath10-dependent , and further increase the uncertainty in the extracted form factors .",
    "the main improvements in e01 - 001 come from detecting the struck proton , rather than the scattered electron . in this case , the beam energy and proton angles change , but the proton momentum is fixed and the cross section is nearly constant , so there are no momentum - dependent corrections in the @xmath10-dependence at fixed @xmath0 , and the rate - dependent corrections are many times smaller .",
    "the large rate dependence when detecting electrons also means that the low @xmath10 measurements , corresponding to backward angle electrons , are typically limited by lack of statistics .",
    "the minimum cross section is an order of magnitude larger for proton detection then electron detection in our kinematics .",
    "in addition , because the cross section is nearly constant , measurements can be made with fixed beam currents , which reduces the uncertainties related to possible current - dependence in the beam current monitoring and target density fluctuations caused by local beam heating .",
    "finally , detecting the proton reduces the uncertainties related to knowledge of the beam energy and scattering angle , as well as reducing the size and @xmath10-dependence of the radiative corrections that must be applied .    while there are corrections that are larger when detecting protons , they generally have little effect on the extraction of @xmath8 .",
    "proton absorption and the use of acceptance - defining software cuts lead to significant ( few percent ) uncertainties in the absolute cross section , but the corrections are identical for all @xmath10 values at a fixed @xmath0 , and therefore do no lead to any additional uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath8 .",
    "backgrounds due to inelastic processes are also larger than for measurements where the electron is detected .",
    "these are currently the dominant sources of uncertainty in the measurement , but the overall systematic uncertainty in the extracted form factor ratio , @xmath8 , is still significantly better than any previous rosenbluth separations in this @xmath0 range .",
    "figure  [ fig : rosenbluth ] shows the @xmath10-dependence of the reduced cross sections , along with a fit to the slope , which is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the figure also shows the slope predicted by polarization transfer measurements  @xcite ( dotted line ) and the global rosenbluth analysis  @xcite ( dashed line ) .",
    "the uncertainties shown include only the statistical and totally uncorrelated point - to - point systematic uncertainties , so that the calculated @xmath18 values and confidence levels are meaningful . while the @xmath18 values are quite small for the large @xmath0 points , there are only one or two degrees of freedom in the fits , and so the confidence level is never unreasonably high or low .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties , not included in fig .  [ fig : rosenbluth ] , will also contribute to the uncertainty to the extracted slope , and thus the value of @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , the results are in much better agreement with previous rosenbluth extractions of @xmath8 than with the results obtained by polarization transfer , with significantly reduced systematic uncertainties compared to previous measurements .",
    "this result essentially rules out the possibility that the disagreement is due to underestimation of the corrections or uncertainties due to momentum- or rate - dependent systematic uncertainties in previous rosenbluth separation measurements .",
    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy is a problem with the data or analysis of the polarization transfer measurements .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties of the polarization transfer experiment have been studied in detail  @xcite , and there is no indication of any uncertainties large enough to explain the discrepancy .",
    "the other possibility is that the discrepancy is related to a more fundamental problem with the rosenbluth or polarization transfer techniques .",
    "so far , most work has focussed on the possibility that two - photon exchange corrections may lead to an @xmath10-dependent correction to the cross section , which is not currently being taken into account .",
    "such two - photon corrections were generally estimated to be small , and this appeared to be confirmed by measurements comparing positron and electron scattering .",
    "however , recent calculations of the two - photon corrections  @xcite , and a reexamination of the positron data  @xcite , indicate that two - photon corrections may in fact play an important role in this kinematic region .",
    "if the discrepancy is explained by two - photon effects , then these need be be understood in detail before we can reliably extract precise form factors .",
    "the effect of two - photon exchange terms on the polarization transfer extraction are expected to be relatively small , but this must be demonstrated quantitatively .",
    "in addition , since the polarization transfer extracts only the ratio @xmath8 , the cross sections are still necessary to extract @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately , and so these corrections to the cross section must be well understood .    while these data do not provide",
    "a full explanation of the discrepancy , excluding experimental error in the previous cross section measurements is extremely important in determining the impact of this discrepancy on other measurements .",
    "since the discrepancy is not a result of errors in the previous cross section measurements , the form factors extracted from a rosenbluth separation ( a direct fit to the cross section data ) will provide a good parameterization of the measured elastic electron - proton cross section , even if the form factors do not correspond to the ` true ' form factors of the proton .",
    "these form factors are therefore the appropriate ones to use when using elastic scattering to check experimental normalizations .",
    "they are also appropriate as input to the analysis of quasielastic experiment , unless the missing corrections are different for @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , the polarization form factors _ will not _ yield the correct electron - proton cross section , and will give incorrect results if used as input to the analysis of experiments that rely on knowledge of the elastic electron - proton cross section .",
    "preliminary result from a high - precision rosenbluth separation measurement of @xmath8 from jefferson lab e01 - 001 are in good agreement with previous rosenbluth extractions .",
    "they clearly disagree with polarization transfer measurements of similar precision .",
    "this shows that the discrepancy is more than a simple experimental problem with previous rosenbluth extractions . while the new results from this experiment do not provide",
    "a full explanation of the discrepancy , excluding experimental error in the previous cross section measurements is extremely important in determining the impact of this discrepancy on other measurements .",
    "if the discrepancy is not a result of errors in the previous cross section measurements , then the form factors extracted from a rosenbluth separation will provide a good parameterization of the measured elastic electron - proton cross section , even though they may not represent the underlying structure of the proton .",
    "similarly , form factors extracted from the polarization transfer measurements may represent the true form factors , but do no provide a good parameterization of the elastic cross section .",
    "it is quite possible that two - photon exchange corrections , only partially taken into account in standard radiative correction prescriptions , may be the explanation for the discrepancy .",
    "however , until the details are understood , we can not be certain of the proton form factors .",
    "the two - photon contributions to the polarization transfer reactions are assumed to be small , but may not be negligible  @xcite , and even if we assume that the discrepancy is due _ entirely _ to corrections to the cross section , there are still small uncertainties in the form factors extracted from a combined analysis if we do not fully understand these missing correction  @xcite . while further theoretical and experimental work is clearly required to fully understand the importance of these two - photon contributions , the confirmation of previous rosenbluth measurements answers an important experimental question , directly relevant to this workshop : what are the correct form factors to use as input in the analysis of quasielastic data ?"
