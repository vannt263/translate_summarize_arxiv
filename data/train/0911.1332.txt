    "the study of the non - trivial zeros of @xmath3 has been the subject of myriad investigations over the years and is of ongoing interest in number theory .",
    "it has also recently received attention from the physics community @xcite .",
    "strangely , the results being presented here can not be found in any of the summaries ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or primary research articles ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that i have consulted .",
    "although it seems inconceivable that they have escaped detection over the centuries , if such is the case , a possible explanation is that the analysis involves complicated manipulation of long expressions , a task best relegated to computer algebra , and only in the last few years have computer algebra codes reached a level of sophistication that allows such manipulation to proceed . in any case , since these results ( perhaps buried , more likely new ) impart significant insight into the nature and location of the zeros of @xmath3 , i am taking the opportunity to summarize here the results i have found .",
    "on page 50 of ivic s book ( @xcite ) , it is written : `` the functional equation for @xmath3 in a certain sense characterizes it completely '' . accepting",
    "the truth of that statement suggests that a study of the functional equation should yield insight into the nature of the zeros of @xmath3 .",
    "that is the path taken here .",
    "the functional equation for @xmath3 is well - known ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath5    and the existence of the trivial zeros of @xmath6 is immediately apparent due to the appearance of the cosine function on the right hand side . with reference to appendix a , where an index of notation will be found",
    ", it is possible to break ( 1 ) into its real and imaginary parts , giving the functional equation in an equivalent form : @xmath7    @xmath8    where explicit expressions for the coefficient functions p and q are presented in appendix b and reference to dependence on the independent ( real ) variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath2 have been omitted .    instead of studying ( [ zeta1 ] ) , being a functional equation between complex variables and functions , consider the equivalent forms ( [ zeta2a ] ) and ( [ zeta2b ] ) , which can be interpreted as the statement of a coupling that exists among two independent functions ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and two dependent functions ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) of two real variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "all quantities are real and this is emphasized by writing @xmath15 to mean @xmath16 and similarly for @xmath17 .",
    "the intent is to study ( [ zeta2a ] ) and ( [ zeta2b ] ) to determine if these two constraints can be used to specify a region(s ) of the @xmath18 plane ( corresponding to the complex @xmath19 plane ) where full - zeros of @xmath20 may possibly be found .",
    "`` half - zero '' refers to points ( or continuous regions ) of the @xmath21 plane where @xmath22 or @xmath23 but not both ; `` full - zero '' refers to any of the set of points @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 simultaneously .",
    "because @xmath20 is known to be meromorphic ( no branch cuts ) @xcite , the location of full - zeros of @xmath20 must be isolated in the complex _ s _ plane , and this property will be reflected by a similar property of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the ( real ) @xmath27 plane .    in the following ,",
    "the intent is to search for zeros of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 with the variable @xmath31 being treated as a parameter ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a search for full - zeros along horizontal lines of the @xmath33 plane within the critical strip , graphically corresponding to that same strip in the complex plane @xmath34 . because p and q have no singularities ( poles ) , notice that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 at some point @xmath37 then ( [ zeta2a ] ) and ( [ zeta2b ] ) require that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "so , any full - zero of @xmath40 that lies in the range @xmath41 will be mirrored about the @xmath42 axis ( the critical line ) by a full - zero in the range @xmath43 , on the horizontal line @xmath44 .",
    "this property is well - known and does not necessarily hold true for half - zeros .    with this result in mind",
    ", a search constraint will be applied that imposes a necessary , but not sufficient condition for a zero of @xmath40 to exist .",
    "that is , the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 and their respective functions reflected about the critical line will be required to be equal ( but not necessarily zero ) .",
    "a full - zero of @xmath40 represents a special case of this more general condition .",
    "specifically @xmath45    and @xmath46    application of ( [ ztrezr ] ) and ( [ ztiezi ] ) to ( [ zeta2a ] ) and ( [ zeta2b ] ) yields a set of transcendental equations isolating correspondingly special values of @xmath30 and @xmath47 through the following constraints :    @xmath48    @xmath49    giving a necessary condition on @xmath30 and @xmath47 through the requirement that    @xmath50    provided that    @xmath51    the cases corresponding to the failure of [ rineq ] will be discussed shortly .    for general values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , a lengthy calculation using ( [ p ] ) and ( [ q ] ) shows that p and _ q _ have the general property that    @xmath52    from which ( [ pqcondition ] ) imposes the following constraint on @xmath30 and @xmath53 after some rearrangement and the use of ( [ gammasq2 ] ) :    @xmath54    for which the main solution is    @xmath55    consistent with what riemann famously hypothesized .",
    "see appendix c where a second possibility is isolated and discarded .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "that is , ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) trivially implies the truth of ( [ ztrezr ] ) and ( [ ztiezi ] ) , but ( [ pqcondition ] ) does nt .",
    "but , with the exception of the case discussed in appendix c , ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) implies ( [ pqcondition ] ) uniquely , so ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for all of ( [ ztrezr ] ) , ( [ ztiezi ] ) and ( [ pqcondition ] ) , which themselves are prerequisites ( necessary ) for the presence of a zero of @xmath0 .",
    "so , with the exception of the pathology discussed in appendix c , ( [ ztrezr ] ) and ( [ ztiezi ] ) can only occur , and hence a full - zero of @xmath20 can only be found , when ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) is satisfied , subject to ( [ rineq ] ) , whose failure unfortunately corresponds to exactly those special values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 of specific interest .",
    "there are two cases where ( [ rineq ] ) fails - half - zeros and full - zeros .",
    "the case of half - zeros is easily dealt with , since it is clear that ( [ zeta2a ] ) and ( [ zeta2b ] ) are incompatible with ( [ ztrezr ] ) and ( [ ztiezi ] ) at a half - zero unless @xmath56 and @xmath57 , thereby satisfying ( [ pqcondition ] ) spontaneously .",
    "thus there is no expectation that a half - zero will satisfy ( [ zeta3a ] ) and ( [ zeta3b ] ) in general , although the sieves ( [ ztrezr ] ) and/or ( [ ztiezi ] ) may occasionally catch some half - zeros , so this case is a subset of the general result , and ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) does not necessarily apply .    as noted before ,",
    "all full - zeros of @xmath0 are distinct , meaning that it is possible to expand @xmath0 in a taylor series in a neighbourhood of the full - zero .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary and real parts of a meromorphic function at a full - zero must be of the same degree , so for a full - zero of degree _",
    "m _ in the neighbourhood of a solution to ( [ zeta3a ] ) and ( [ zeta3b ] ) where it happens that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one can write    @xmath60    and @xmath61    where    @xmath62    and @xmath63 it is emphasized that the partial derivative is taken with respect to @xmath9 because the search for a full - zero is being conducted along a horizontal line in the ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) plane .",
    "substitution of ( [ tayr ] ) and ( [ tayi ] ) into ( [ zeta3a ] ) and ( [ zeta3b ] ) yields ( [ pqcondition ] ) and then ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) , the same result as before , except that the equivalent of ( [ rineq ] ) is always true , because @xmath64 and @xmath65 are non - zero by the definition of _ \" a zero of degree m\"_.    thus , with the exception of the case discussed in appendix c , ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) is the only solution to a necessary condition for locating a full - zero of @xmath0 in the finite ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) plane ( and hence the finite complex _ s _ plane by extension ) , explaining why non - trivial , full - zeros of @xmath3 have only ever been located on the critical line ( [ sigeqhalf ] ) .",
    "for the totality of this section and the next , the variable @xmath42 . with this understanding , the constraints ( [ ztrezr ] ) and ( [ ztiezi ] ) reduce to an identity and ( [ zeta3a ] ) and ( [ zeta3b ] )",
    "can conveniently be written in the form    @xmath67    and @xmath68    where expressions for n , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given in appendix b , yielding the further identities    @xmath71    and @xmath72    from which it is clear that    @xmath73    since @xmath74 and @xmath75 must have the same sign .",
    "( [ nsq ] ) demonstrates that n shares the zeros of both @xmath74 and @xmath76 . since both of the latter can not vanish simultaneously due to ( [ drpdi ] )",
    ", the zeros of @xmath74 and @xmath76 will locate the half - zeros , but not the full - zeros , of @xmath77 along the critical line , because if a zero of @xmath78 carried one of the full - zeros of @xmath77 , ( [ zr ] ) and ( [ zi ] ) show that the order of the zeros of @xmath79 and @xmath80 would be inconsistent .",
    "specifically    @xmath81    the full - zeros of @xmath77 for a zero of degree @xmath82 are obtained by applying lhpital s rule of differentiation with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "any solution of    @xmath83    will thus isolate a potential full - zero of @xmath77 , but as discussed previously , ( [ zprime ] ) is only a necessary condition for achieving this task .",
    "thus a numerical solution does not guarantee that a full - zero has been found , although the set of all solutions will include all the full - zeros as a subset .",
    "limited experimentation ( see section 4 ) indicates that , at least for @xmath84 , only the full - zeros of @xmath77 are ever located by ( [ zprime ] ) ; no solutions with @xmath85 have been found .",
    "the various functions introduced can be used to locate both the half- and full- zeros by numerically solving transcendental equations . from ( [ nsq ] ) and ( [ drdiz ] ) , all solutions of @xmath86",
    "will specify all the half - zeros of @xmath0 on the critical line . in the notation of appendix b ,",
    "@xmath87    is a simple form of this constraint .",
    "each successive solution with increasing values of @xmath31 will locate successive half - zeros of @xmath88 and @xmath89 alternately , as illustrated in figure ( [ dzfig ] ) .",
    "an interesting variant of ( [ dz ] ) arises by re - writing the terms explicitly , giving    @xmath90    and , to the extent that @xmath91 , ( [ gratio ] ) can be inverted to read    @xmath92    if the first order stirling s approximation ( @xcite ) for @xmath93 is applied to the ratio @xmath94 , a simple form emerges :    @xmath95    which can replace the left - hand side of ( [ gratio ] ) .",
    "alternatively , ( [ tanrp ] ) becomes    @xmath96    these forms contain numerous poles and zeros and appear to have little numerical use , but may possibly be of use in deducing the spacing between zeros @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the location of the full - zeros of @xmath77 is specified indirectly in ( [ zprime ] ) . for simple zeros ( @xmath97 )",
    "the transcendental equation to be solved is    @xmath98    a more convenient form being    @xmath99    from which the full - zeros ) ] can be found by standard numerical techniques ( see figure ( [ dzfig ] ) .",
    "although it may possibly be useful for numerical work , this form is unsatisfying because it requires knowledge of the zeta function derivatives , making it almost tautological .",
    "unfortunately , a form for the full - zeros similar to ( [ dz ] ) , involving only the variable @xmath31 and transcendental functions of that variable , eludes me .",
    "the functional equation for @xmath0 has been expressed in the form of a coupling between its real and imaginary components .",
    "it was shown that non - trivial , full zeros of @xmath0 , if any exist , are only compatible with a solution to the functional coupling equations for special values of the underlying independent variable @xmath100  .",
    "two possible sets of values were located ; one of those regions has been explored by others and no zeros have ever been found .",
    "the remaining region consists of the critical line @xmath101 .",
    "this establishes that riemann s hypothesis is true .",
    "additionally , two relatively simple transcendental equations were isolated , the zeros of which coincide with all the zeros of @xmath0 on the critical line .",
