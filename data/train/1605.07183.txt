    "one of the simplest examples of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) is new fermions in vector - like representations of the sm gauge group .",
    "the dynamics of the new fermions is drastically different if they are charged under a new confining non - abelian gauge group .",
    "condensation spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry of the fermions and massless nambu - goldstone boson ( ngb ) modes manifest which potentially couple to sm gauge bosons via triangle anomalies  @xcite .",
    "the fermions must have an explicitly chiral symmetry breaking mass @xmath3 in order to lift the ngb s and avoid additional massless degrees of freedom .    if the confinement scale @xmath4 is in the range probed by the lhc , the ngb modes are accessible only if @xmath5 .",
    "if the fermion masses are heavy , @xmath6 , the lightest degree of freedom will instead be a spin - zero glueball that is nearly decoupled from the sm even if the fermions are charged under the sm gauge groups .",
    "although technically natural , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the fermion masses to be lighter than the confinement scale .",
    "this problem is even more acute in models that place the constituent fermions in representations of a grand unified theory ( gut ) gauge group .",
    "the fermion masses are then generally set by a combination of vector - like mass terms and couplings to the gut - breaking sector as [ eq : mass - contrib ] - m| - y | _ 24 , with @xmath7 . in order for the resulting fermion masses to be close to but below the confinement scale",
    ", these two contributions must either have very small coefficients , or cancel out very finely to arrange a tev - scale mass . while this is true in gut models",
    ", it can also be the case for example in models of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "technical naturalness protects the fermion masses from large loop corrections , but they can still receive large contributions to their masses when coupled to any singlet which acquires a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the sm qcd sector evades this puzzle and indeed has non - decoupled pions close to the scale of strong dynamics .",
    "the puzzle is resolved through a combination of factors : small yukawa couplings , but also a chiral gauge symmetry structure .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the new strong dynamics sector operates in a similar way . since the fermions can not be chiral under the gut gauge group and be consistent with constraints on a chiral fourth generation  @xcite , they can only be chiral under a new gauge group . for simplicity ,",
    "we study the case where this new gauge group is a @xmath0 abelian group . if the fermions are charged under this additional gauge group , then the terms of eq .",
    "are forbidden without additional insertions of a @xmath0-breaking vev . given a @xmath0-breaking sector near the scale @xmath4",
    ", the lightest composite particles will also be near @xmath4 and will have large couplings to the sm . while there is still a coincidence of scales , it is far less acute .",
    "the fermion masses will no longer be near the gut scale , but rather the scale at which the hierarchy problem is ultimately resolved .    in this paper , we consider a model with an @xmath8 ( big - color ) confining gauge group and a @xmath0 abelian group .",
    "we also take the fermions in the big - color sector ( big - quarks ) to transform as fundamentals of an @xmath9 symmetry .  , @xmath8 , and @xmath0 together due to anomaly cancellation .",
    "given the sm fermion charges and gauge coupling running , @xmath9 unification has additional motivation from experimental data . ]",
    "their charge under the abelian group is chiral , such that the big - quark masses will be forbidden without additional structure . to give the big - quarks mass ,",
    "we introduce a scalar @xmath10 charged under @xmath0 that couples to the big - quarks .",
    "it develops a vev through its coupling to the confining sector , lifting the big - pion masses to be close to , but below , the mass of @xmath10 . in this way",
    ", we construct a chiral model that not only has an experimentally - accessible spectrum , but also that alleviates the tension caused by the coincidence of scales .",
    "the addition of the abelian gauge group with chiral structure has important and interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "in particular , there is an additional massive @xmath2 gauge boson coupling to the big - quarks and mixing with the sm @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this opens new decay modes for the big - pions , as well as the possibility of direct production of the @xmath2 .",
    "the chiral structure also leads to additional accidentally approximate discrete and continuous symmetries that lead to three - body decays and potentially long - lived particles .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present the detailed structure of the chiral composite model . within that section",
    ", we study the chiral symmetry breaking pattern in subsection [ sec : symmetry - breaking ] , the big - pion spectrum in subsection [ sec : pion - spectrum ] , the properties of the @xmath2 boson in subsection [ sec : zprime - interactions ] , and the properties of the big - pions in subsection [ sec : pion - interaction ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : real - scalar ] , we discuss the perturbativity of models with the elementary real scalar field as a light resonance .",
    "we study @xmath13 gauge coupling running in appendix  [ sec : gprime - running ] and the yukawa coupling running in appendix  [ app : yd - over - yt ] .",
    "kinetic mixing and decay properties of the @xmath2 are given in appendix  [ app : zprime - diagonalize ] .",
    "as described above , we study a model with a confining gauge group @xmath8 with a confinement scale @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "we introduce big - quarks charged under both the sm gauge group and @xmath8 . due to the electroweak constraints mentioned above , the big - quarks can not be chiral under the sm gauge group , so we introduce an abelian @xmath0 gauge symmetry with chiral charges . in order for the @xmath0 group to be gauge anomaly - free , we must have two sets of big - quarks .",
    "the chiral structure of the charges prevents large quark mass contributions from uv scales such as the gut scale . as in the sm",
    ", we introduce a scalar field @xmath10 charged under @xmath0 that can develop a vev to spontaneously break @xmath0 and give a mass to the corresponding gauge boson @xmath2 .",
    "we show the content of our model as well as the gauge symmetries in table  [ tab : fieldcontent ] .",
    ".field content of a chiral model with a confining qcd - like gauge group @xmath8 and @xmath0 . here , @xmath16 .",
    "the sm model fermions are neutral under @xmath0 and are not listed here .",
    "the @xmath13 charge assignment shown here to achieve anomaly cancellation is not unique ; one may also assign charges of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . [",
