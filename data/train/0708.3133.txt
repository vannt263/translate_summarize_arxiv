    "<S> the surprise discovery of superconductivity below 5k in sodium cobalt oxides when hydrated with water has caught the attention of experimentalists and theorists alike . </S>",
    "<S> most explanations for its occurence have focused heavily on the properties of some small elliptically shaped pockets predicted to be the electronically dominant fermi surface sheet , but direct attempts to look for them have instead cast serious doubts over their existence . </S>",

    "<S> although many analogies have been drawn with the high-@xmath3 cuprates ( for instance , as being possibly the only other example of a mott insulator becoming superconducting under doping @xcite ) , the sodium cobaltate system exhibits its own unique set of anomalous behaviour such as unusually high thermopower @xcite and @xmath4-linear resistivity @xcite ) , distinctly indicative of strongly correlated electron behaviour . in a conventional superconductor , </S>",
    "<S> electrons at the fermi surface form cooper pairs under an attractive interaction mediated by lattice vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> the manner in which electrons form these pairs can be strongly influenced by the shape of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> questions regarding the origin of the pairing interaction and the nature of the superconductivity in the cobaltates has stimulated significant theoretical speculation , most of which has focused heavily on the properties of some small elliptically shaped pockets predicted to be the electronically dominant fermi surface sheet @xcite , but the outcome of direct attempts to look for them has instead cast serious doubt over their existence @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that these pockets do indeed exist , based on bulk measurements of the electron momentum distribution in unhydrated and hydrated sodium cobalt oxides using the technique of x - ray compton scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath2 comprises hexagonal planes of electronically active edge - sharing coo@xmath5 octahedra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these planes are separated by insulating layers of na , and , in the hydrated samples , water , that serve as spacers ( resulting in electronic two - dimensionality ) and charge reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> the intercalation of water , at a concentration of @xmath6 , has a dramatic effect on properties of the compound . </S>",
    "<S> it is accompanied by a near doubling of the @xmath7-axis lattice parameter and , for @xmath8 , the onset of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of electronic structure based on the local - density - approximation ( lda ) predict , for concentrations @xmath90.6 in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 , a fermi surface composed of two hole sheets originating from co @xmath10-orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the larger sheet , of @xmath11 character , is centred at the @xmath12-point ( zone centre ) whereas the other sheet , of @xmath13 character , comprises six smaller elliptical cylinders located between @xmath12 and @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 , this band becomes completely filled and does not contribute to the fermi surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath13 pockets may be of considerable importance , since many of the models for superconductivity in na@xmath0coo@xmath16h@xmath2o are predicated upon their existence . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an analysis of permitted order - parameter symmetries has indicated that an unconventional @xmath17-wave ( @xmath18 ) would be the most probable if the pockets exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with 70% of the density - of - states at the fermi level , these pockets are central to several models of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity , developing either via imperfect nesting between the fermi surface pockets @xcite , or as a consequence of these disconnected pieces of fermi surface @xcite .    a series of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) results </S>",
    "<S> , the consensus of which report observation of the @xmath11 sheet at @xmath12 but crucially not the @xmath13 pockets , has fuelled the controversy surrounding the elliptical pockets . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , they observe the @xmath13 band as lying completely below the fermi level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well - known that surface effects and matrix elements can have a strong influence on photoemission results , although there are recent reports of measurements being made with an electron escape depth of 200 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we directly tackle this controversy by presenting a compton scattering study both of the fermi surfaces of a representative set of compositions of the unhydrated parent compound na@xmath0coo@xmath2 ( @xmath19=0.38 , 0.51 and 0.74 ) and a hydrated ( actually deuterated ) sample at a superconducting composition , na@xmath20coo@xmath21d@xmath2o . </S>",
    "<S> for these measurements , single crystals of @xmath22 were grown in warwick using the floating - zone technique . </S>",
    "<S> samples of lower sodium concentration were then obtained by a chemical deintercalation method , immersing the crystals in solutions of br@xmath23 and acetonitrile . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice parameters were obtained by x - ray diffraction ; the relationship between na doping and the crystal structure is well characterised by powder neutron diffraction measurements and icp - aes techniques @xcite and so the sodium concentrations for the three crystals used in this study were determined as 0.74(1 ) , 0.51(1 ) and 0.38(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic properties ( magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity and transport measurements @xcite ) are identical to those previously reported for similar compositions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting sample was produced by the chemical intercalation of deuterium oxide ( d@xmath2o was used rather than h@xmath2o to allow future neutron experiments on the same sample ) by submersion in liquid d@xmath2o for three months at 5@xmath24c @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent to the compton experiment , a measurement of its magnetisation showed that it was superconducting at a temperature of 3.5k .    </S>",
    "<S> a compton profile represents a double integral ( one - dimensional projection ) of the full three - dimensional electron momentum density . for each composition , five compton profiles equally spaced between @xmath12-@xmath25 and @xmath12-@xmath14 were measured on the high - resolution compton spectrometer of beamline bl08w at the spring-8 synchrotron . </S>",
    "<S> the unhydrated measurements were made at room temperature , while those on the hydrated sample were at 11k . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrated sample was transferred from a d@xmath2o bath directly onto a cryostat precooled to @xmath26k under a helium atmosphere in order to preserve the hydration . on removal at the end of the measurement , the sample </S>",
    "<S> was observed to be still in its hydrated state . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrometer consists of a cauchois - type crystal analyser and a position - sensitive detector , with a resolution fwhm at the compton peak of 0.115  a.u ( 1  a.u .  of momentum  @xmath27  1.99  @xmath2810@xmath29  kg  m  s@xmath30 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each compton profile , @xmath31 counts in the peak data channel were accumulated , and each compton profile was corrected for possible multiple - scattering contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a two - dimensional momentum density , representing a projection down the @xmath7-axis of the full three - dimensional density , was reconstructed from each set of five profiles using tomographic techniques @xcite and then folded back into the first bz using the lock - crisp - west procedure @xcite to obtain the occupation density from which the occupied parts of the bz could be inferred . </S>",

    "<S> [ expfs ] ) is also strongly suggestive of the presence of small hole pockets , which can be discerned close to the central hexagon ; it is also worth remarking that the @xmath11 sheet retains a strong hexagonal shape , whereas electronic structure calculations in the hydrated structure ( although without the actual presence of water ) predict something more circular @xcite . </S>",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     recent measurement of shubnikov - de haas oscillations in na@xmath36coo@xmath2 indicate the presence of some unidentified fermi surface pockets occupying approximately 0.6% and 1.4% of the bz @xcite , which is consistent with our estimate of the size of each pocket we observe occupying about 0.8% ( table  [ fsparam ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an examination of phonon softening in this system by rueff _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is interpreted by those authors as strong evidence for the existence of nested pockets .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of why the arpes experiments have consistently not observed these e@xmath35 pockets remains . </S>",
    "<S> issues such as surface sensitivity , including possible surface relaxations of coo@xmath5 octahedral contractions that destroy the pockets @xcite , as well as matrix - element effects or na disorder @xcite must be possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> however , at least in the superconducting compound , it is very difficult to reconcile the observed behaviour of the specific heat , or even understand the presence of superconductivity without the presence of the @xmath13 pockets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in an attempt to take into account coulomb correlations not included in the lda , calculations @xcite based on the lda@xmath37 approach , have suggested that for a sufficiently large coulomb energy ( @xmath38 ev ) the @xmath13 band is pulled below the fermi level , eliminating these smaller fermi surface pockets for all na concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> however , other studies have put an upper limit of about 2.3ev on @xmath39 @xcite , and when dynamical coulomb correlations are incorporated the effect is to stabilize the @xmath13 pockets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical debate rages on , with predictions in support of @xcite and contrary to @xcite the existence of these pockets .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the fermi surface of several members ( @xmath33 , 0.51 and 0.74 ) of the unhydrated sodium cobalt oxide na@xmath0coo@xmath2 and of a hydrated composition na@xmath20coo@xmath21d@xmath2o . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable _ qualitative _ agreement is observed between our experimentally determined fermi surfaces and the lda predictions , and there is clear evidence for the smaller e@xmath35 elliptical hole pockets which develop at lower na concentrations than na@xmath34coo@xmath2 . for na@xmath40coo@xmath2 , their presence </S>",
    "<S> is clearly indicated in experimental maps of the occupancy within the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , however , the occupancy map for na@xmath20coo@xmath21d@xmath2o also shows the presence of small e@xmath35 elliptical hole pockets . while alternative models that describe the superconductivity arising as a consequence of frustration on the triangular lattice @xcite , nesting across the large , hexagonal sheet @xcite , or spin fluctuations enhanced by the dopant dynamics @xcite are not ( and can not be ) ruled out , the observation of the pockets lends strong support to theories based on their special nesting properties </S>"
