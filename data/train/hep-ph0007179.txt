    "<S> we discuss whether electric charge conservation may not hold in four - dimensional world in models with infinite extra dimensions , i.e. , whether escape of charged particles from our brane is consistent with effectively four - dimensional electrodynamics on the brane . </S>",

    "<S> even tiny non - conservation of electric charge leads to contradictions to low - energy tests of quantum electrodynamics unless exotic millicharged particles are introduced @xcite ( see , however , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a new perspective emerges in theories describing our world as a brane embedded in higher dimensional space with infinite extra dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that in these theories , particles initially residing on our brane may eventually leave the brane and disappear into extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this leakage of particles has been found to be generic at least in a class of field theoretic models of localization of matter on a brane : once matter fields get small but non - vanishing masses , the localization becomes incomplete and particles tunnel from the brane into extra dimensions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if particles that leave our brane are electrically charged , their disappearance into extra dimensions would result in the non - conservation of electric charge , as seen by a four - dimensional observer . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in this scenario electric charge is conserved in the full multi - dimensional space ; the charge non - conservation in four - dimensional world is merely a consequence of incapability of our devices to detect the charges outside the brane . </S>",
    "<S> still , this scenario has distinctive experimental signatures such as literally disappearing electrons . </S>",
    "<S> hence , an observation of processes like @xmath2 would be a strong evidence for the existence of infinite extra dimensions . in a sence , this probe of extra dimensions is complementary to searches expoloiting the possibility of low fundamental gravity scale : the latter possibility exists irrespectively of whether extra dimensions are compact @xcite or infinite @xcite whereas the disappearance of matter emerges in theories with infinite extra dimensions but does not require the low fundamental scale of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of proccesses like @xmath2 are naturally small @xcite but presently can not be reliably predicted as they depend on the localization mechanism and unknown parameters of extra - dimensional physics .    </S>",
    "<S> one may worry that non - conservation of electric charge in our world may be in contradiction with the fact that electrodynamics on the brane is effectively four - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the standard lore is that the charge conservation in our world is guaranteed by the four - dimensional gauss law ( and causality , i.e. , absence of action - at - a - distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to prove by example that there is no contradiction at all : in a model we consider , escape of charges into extra dimensions is perfectly consistent with localization of electromagnetism on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting picture is that physics becomes intrinsically multi - dimensional once the charged particles leave the brane ; the four - dimensional gauss law is no longer valid ; the electromagnetic field induced on the brane by escaping charges does not obey the four - dimensional maxwell s equations ; this induced field gradually decreases in a causal manner and finally disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue we discuss in this paper has a close gravitational analogy : matter leaking into extra dimensions carries away energy , so one may wonder whether this is consistent with the `` gauss law '' of four - dimensional general relativity describing gravity on our brane . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational field of escaping particles has been studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the results very similar to those outlined in the previous paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> we will closely follow ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite both in spirit and in some of the technicalities .    </S>",
    "<S> to discuss the consistency of charge non - conservation on the brane with four - dimensional behavior of electromagnetism , we have in the first place to construct a model with a localized photon . </S>",
    "<S> a simple possibility is the localization of a photon due to gravity produced by the brane itself , which is very much the same mechanism as one leading to the localization of a graviton @xcite and a scalar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider space - time with @xmath3 dimensions , @xmath4 of which are compact and one is infinite and `` warped '' . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we consider compactification on @xmath4-dimensional torus . </S>",
    "<S> let our world be a @xmath5-brane with @xmath4 compact dimensions of very small size ( smaller than tev@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the brane has a certain tension , and there is a negative bulk cosmological constant . with this setup and appropriate fine - tuning between the bulk cosmological constant and brane tension </S>",

    "<S> @xmath11 and @xmath12 is determined by the bulk cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now introduce the @xmath13 gauge field @xmath14 propagating in the background ( [ * ] ) . with appropriate rescaling , </S>",
    "<S> its free action is @xmath15 as we consider small @xmath10 and low energies , we truncate this action to the zero kaluza  klein modes of compact @xmath4 dimensions , i.e. , take @xmath14 independent of @xmath16 . to see that there exists a photon localized on the brane , </S>",
    "<S> consider the action for four - vector components @xmath17 of the gauge potential , @xmath18 we see that the measure determining the normalization factor is @xmath19 hence , the @xmath20-independent mode , @xmath21 , is normalizable ; this is the wave function of the localized photon , up to a normalization factor proportional to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason of why we had to generalize the five - dimensional randall  sundrum setup is now obvious : at @xmath23 there is no localized photon @xcite , but at @xmath24 gauge fields localize on the brane , and electrodynamics on the brane becomes four - dimensional at large distances .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the gauge field induced on the brane by charges escaping into the non - compact dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we again take the charged fields independent of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of charges along the @xmath20-direction is then treated in the classical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider for definiteness a single particle that has been at rest on the brane at @xmath25 and @xmath26 and then ( at time @xmath27 ) escapes the brane towards positive @xmath20 with zero initial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> ( the same calculation applies to the process of escape of a particle in an orbifold setup with fixed point @xmath28 . )    the particle moves perpendicular to the brane and gets accelerated towards large @xmath20 by the gravitational field @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this current induces the electromagnetic field everywhere in space - time according to maxwell s equations @xmath33 since @xmath34 , it is consistent to set @xmath35 , and also consider @xmath14 independent of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can choose the gauge @xmath36 then maxwell s equations ( [ max ] ) reduce to two equations . </S>",

    "<S> the only relevant component of @xmath41 on the brane is then @xmath42 upon introducing a variable @xmath43 this expression is written in the following explicit form @xmath44 we will be interested in length scales much larger than @xmath45 , so we will set @xmath46 in the rest of our analysis .    to proceed further , </S>",

    "<S> anti - symmetric modes vanish on the brane , so they do not contribute to the green s function at @xmath28 . since we are calculating the gauge field on the brane , we can neglect anti - symmetric modes in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ summode ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric modes are @xmath48 where @xmath49 these continuum modes are normalized to @xmath50 with the weight ( [ 3 + ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 4 * ] ) that the induced gauge potential @xmath53 is a static coulomb potential , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising , as electrodynamics is effectively four - dimensional in the zero mode approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the zero mode approximation is not justified when charges move outside the brane , so we proceed to evaluate the complete green s function . at large distances , @xmath55 , and well away from the light cone , @xmath56 , only relatively small masses @xmath57 are relevant , and we obtain @xmath58 where we set @xmath28 , as we are interested in the induced field on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> note that the first term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 10 * ] ) cancels out due to completeness of the set of the modes ( including the zero mode ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the electromagnetic field induced on the brane by escaping charges switches off in a causal way .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the electric charge non - conservation in the brane world via the leakage of charged particles into extra dimensions is consistent with effectively four - dimensional electrodynamics governing the long distance interactions of charges residing on the brane . in the setup we introduced in this paper , escaping charge </S>",
    "<S> induces spherical electromagnetic wave on the brane ; beyond this wave electromagnetic field gradually disappears . </S>",
    "<S> this wave is a collective effect of the photon zero mode and continuum modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of continuum bulk modes with arbitrarily small four - dimensional `` masses '' is crucial for this phenomenon , as it makes the problem intrinsically five - dimensional even at large distances , and in this way the 4-d gauss law obstruction to the electric charge non - conservation is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the non - conservation of electric charge on the brane is possible in all models with localized photon and continuum of electromagnetic modes in the bulk that starts from zero four - dimensional `` mass '' . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are inherent , in particular , in the six - dimensional string setup of gherghetta and shaposhnikov @xcite ; the localization of a photon in the latter setup has been discussed recently by oda @xcite . on the other hand , those mechanisms of the photon localization which do not incorporate the bulk continuum starting from zero will not allow for the electric charge non - conservation in the brane world ; an example is the dvali  shifman setup @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be understood which possibility is preferable from the point of view of string / m - theory .    </S>",

    "<S> suppose that the quark leaves the brane ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) ; if color is not confined in the bulk , this does not cost very large energy even if the quark travels far away from the brane . </S>",
    "<S> after the quark has moved away , there remains an object on the brane ( shown by dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) which , from the four - dimensional point of view , behaves as a color triplet state with zero baryon number , electric and weak charges , etc . </S>",
    "<S> this object may combine with anti - quark to form a free anti - quark colorless state ( again as viewed from four dimensions ) with quantum numbers of anti - quark ( fig . </S>",
