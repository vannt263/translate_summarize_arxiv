    "electric - field - induced carrier - doping technique , using field - effect - transistor ( fet ) structure or electric - double - layer - transistor ( edlt ) structure ,  @xcite attracts much attention as a new method to carrier doping , other than the methods of chemical doping .",
    "a merit of electric - field - induced doping is that we can control the doping carrier density by a gate voltage in a same sample .",
    "this will be a powerful platform in future studies of condensed matter physics .",
    "when this is used at the surface of insulators , carriers are induced near the surface , and trapped in the confinement potential of the electric field . using enough strong field by edlt , we can realize superconductivity of the surface metallic states at low temperature @xmath2 , such as in @xmath0 ,  @xcite @xmath3 ,  @xcite @xmath4 ,  @xcite @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the gate voltage control of surface superconductivity in @xmath0 was also realized at the interface of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .  @xcite    compared to these developments of experimental research , theoretical understandings are not enough for properties of the electric - field - induced surface superconductivity .",

    "sub - bands are formed in the surface metallic states due to the confinement potential by strong electric fields .",
    "@xcite since multiple sub - bands are occupied by surface carriers , this system is not ideal two - dimensional states .",
    "we also note that the local carrier density @xmath8 has spatial variation as a function of depth @xmath9 from the surface in the surface metallic states , while @xmath8 is constant in bulk metallic states .",
    "the quantitative estimate for the @xmath9 dependence is one of problems for the electric - field - induced metallic state .",
    "therefore , also in the theoretical studies of surface superconductivity , we need to know detailed spatial structure of the superconducting gap in the nanoscale and its sub - band dependence .",
    "these studies enable us to find differences from bulk superconductivity .    in this letter",
    ", we study unique properties ; local electronic states and sub - band dependence in electric - field - induced superconductors .",
    "we will discuss multiple - gap structure of the sub - band dependent surface superconductivity . since we determine the spatial structure in the order of thomas - fermi length near the surface , we solve the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation  @xcite under the electric - field @xmath10 .",
