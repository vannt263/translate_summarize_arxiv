    "a square matrix is doubly stochastic if its entries are all nonnegative and each row and column sum is 1 .",
    "a celebrated result known as birkhoff s theorem about doubly stochastic matrices ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) states that an @xmath8 matrix is doubly stochastic if and only if it is a convex combination of some @xmath8 permutation matrices . considered as elements in @xmath9 ,",
    "the @xmath8 doubly stochastic matrices form a polytope ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the birkhoff s theorem says that the polytope @xmath10 is the same as the polytope ( @xmath11 ) generated by the permutation matrices .",
    "a traditional proof of this result is by making use of a lemma which ensures that every doubly stochastic matrix has a positive diagonal ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.7.1 , p.  548 ) ) . by a diagonal of an @xmath12-square matrix we mean a set of @xmath12 entries taken from different rows and columns .",
    "the @xmath12-square doubly stochastic matrices having a positive diagonal form a polytope ( @xmath13 ) too .",
    "apparently , @xmath14 .",
    "birkhoff s theorem asserts that the three polytopes @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 coincide .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the counterpart of the birkhoff s theorem for higher dimensions . a multidimensional array of numerical values is referred to as a _ tensor _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known as a hypermatrix @xcite .",

    "slice _ of a tensor @xmath16 , we mean a two - dimensional section of tensor @xmath16 obtained by fixing any one of the three indices . for a @xmath19-tensor cube @xmath15",
    ", there are 9 slices , each of which is a square matrix .",
    "an intersection of any two non - parallel slices is called a _ line _ ( also known as _ fiber _ or _ tube _ ) .",
    "that is , a line is a one - dimensional section of a tensor ; it is obtained by fixing all but one indices .",
    "a _ diagonal _ of an @xmath0 tensor cube is a collection of @xmath20 elements such that no two lie on the same line .",
    "a nonnegative tensor is said to have a _ positive diagonal _ if all the elements of a diagonal are positive .",
    "we say such a tensor has the _ positive diagonal property_.    the birkhoff theorem is about the matrices that are 2-way stochastic , while stochastic cubes are 3-way stochastic .",
    "related works on partial or multiple stochasticity such as line or face stochasticity can be found in @xcite , including the recent ones @xcite ( on tensor computation ) , @xcite ( a survey chapter on tensors and hypermatrices ) , @xcite ( on extreme points of tensors ) , and @xcite ( a survey on the spectral theory of nonnegative tensors ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of all @xmath0 stochastic tensors ( i.e. , semi - magic cubes ) .",
    "it is evident that @xmath5 , regarded as a subset of @xmath21 , is convex and compact ( since it is an intersection of finitely many closed half - spaces and it is bounded ) .",
    "it is not difficult to show that every permutation tensor ( i.e. , @xmath22 stochastic tensor ) is a vertex of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the polytope generated ( i.e. , convex combinations of ) by the @xmath0 permutation tensors and let @xmath6 be the set of all @xmath0 stochastic tensors with the positive diagonal property . obviously , @xmath23",
    "if @xmath24 , a straightforward computation yields that @xmath25 for @xmath26 , it is known that each of the above inclusion is proper ( see section 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the number of vertices of @xmath7 ( i.e. , permutation tensors ) is equal to the number of latin squares of order @xmath12 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we assume @xmath27 throughout the paper .",
    "we show a close relation between @xmath6 and @xmath28 , specially , the closure of @xmath6 is @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , a lower bound for the number of the vertices of @xmath5 is available in @xcite . in this paper , we give an upper bound for the number of vertices of @xmath5 .",
    "for an @xmath29 matrix @xmath16 with rows @xmath30 and columns @xmath31 , let @xmath32    vectorizing , or  vecing \" for short , a matrix ( respect to rows or columns ) is a basic method in solving matrix equations .",
    "it also plays an important role in computation .",
    "we present in this section how to  vec \" a cube . this may be useful in tensor computations which is a popular field in these days .    for @xmath8 doubly stochastic matrices",

    "an @xmath8 nonnegative matrix @xmath34 is doubly stochastic if and only if @xmath35 is a nonnegative matrix satisfying @xmath36    when a tensor cube is interpreted in terms of slices @xcite , we see that each slice of a stochastic tensor is a doubly stochastic square matrix .",
    "an intersection of any two nonparallel slices is a _ line _ ( fiber ) .",
    "an @xmath0 tensor cube has @xmath37 lines . considering each line as a column vector of @xmath12 components , we stack all the lines in the order of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 directions ( or modes ) , respectively , to make a column vector of @xmath38 components .",
    "we call such a vector the  line vec \" of the cube and denote it by @xmath39 note that when vecing a 3rd order-@xmath12 dimensional tensor , every entry of the tensor is used 3 times .    for two cubes @xmath16 and @xmath40 of the same size and for any scalar @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 where the left inner product is for tensors while the right one is for vectors .",
    "what follows is a characterization of a stochastic tensor through  vecing \" .",
    "let @xmath44 be the all 1 row vector of @xmath4 components , where @xmath4 is a positive integer .",
    "an @xmath0 nonnegative cube @xmath45 is stochastic if and only if @xmath46    by a direct verification .",
    "it is known that if @xmath47 is an @xmath8 doubly stochastic matrix , then @xmath16 has a positive diagonal ; that is , there exist @xmath12 positive entries of @xmath16 such that no two of these entries are on the same row and same column ( the positive diagonal property ) .",
    "does the polytope of stochastic tensor cubes have the positive diagonal property ?",
    "let @xmath15 be an @xmath0 stochastic cube .",
    "is it true that there always exist @xmath20 positive entries of @xmath16 such that no two of these entries lie on the same line ? in short , does a stochastic tensor have the positive diagonal property ?    it is easy to see that every permutation tensor is an extreme point of @xmath28 .",
    "apparently , the set of nonnegative tensors of the same size forms a cone ; that is , if @xmath16 and @xmath40 ( of the same size ) have the positive diagonal property , then so are @xmath48 and @xmath49 for any positive scalars @xmath50 .",
    "obviously , every permutation tensor possesses the positive diagonal property , so does any convex combination of finitely many permutation tensors",
    ". however , some stochastic tensor cubes fail to have the positive diagonal property as the following example shows .",
    "note that @xmath51 and @xmath5 are convex and compact ( in @xmath21 ) , while @xmath52 is convex but not compact . in what follows ,",
    "example [ ex1 ] shows that a stochastic tensor cube need not have a positive diagonal ( unlike the case of doubly stochastic matrices ) ; example [ ex2 ] shows a stochastic tensor cube with the positive diagonal property need not be generated by permutation tensors .",
    "[ ex1 ] let @xmath53 be the @xmath54 stochastic tensor cube :        which can be  flattened \" to be a @xmath55 matrix @xmath56.\\ ] ]    one may verify ( by starting with the entry 2 at the position ( 3 , 2 , 3 ) ) that @xmath53 has no positive diagonal and @xmath53 is not a convex combination of the permutation tensors .",
    "so @xmath57 .",
    "( in fact , @xmath53 is an extreme point of @xmath58 ; see e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "[ ex2 ] taking the stochastic tensor cube @xmath59 with the flattened matrix @xmath60,\\ ] ] we see that @xmath61 by choosing the positive elements @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if @xmath59 is written as @xmath64 , where all @xmath65 are positive with sum 1 , and each @xmath66 is a permutation tensor of the same size , then each @xmath66 has 0 as its entry at position @xmath67 where @xmath68 , that is , every @xmath66 takes the form @xmath69.\\ ] ] there exists only one such permutation tensor with 0 in the @xmath70 position ( @xmath71 ) in the second slice .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 .",
    "so the inclusions @xmath73 are proper .",
    "next we show that the closure of @xmath52 is @xmath5 and also that every interior point of @xmath28 belongs to @xmath6 .",
    "so @xmath52 is  close \" to @xmath5 except some points of the boundary .",
    "the closure of the set of all @xmath0 stochastic tensors having a positive diagonal is the set of all @xmath0 stochastic tensors . in symbol , @xmath74 moreover , every interior point ( tensor ) of @xmath28 has a positive diagonal .",
    "consequently , a stochastic tensor that does not have the positive diagonal property belongs to the boundary @xmath75 of the polytope @xmath28 .    since @xmath76 ,",
    "we have cl@xmath77 for the other way around , observe that every permutation tensor is in @xmath52 . if @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a permutation tensor , then @xmath80 belongs to @xmath52 for any @xmath81 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath82 , if we set @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 .",
    "this says that @xmath85 .",
    "it follows that @xmath86 .",
    "we now show that every interior point of @xmath5 lies in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath40 be an interior point of @xmath5 .",
    "then there is an open ball , denoted by @xmath87 , centered at @xmath40 , inside @xmath5 .",
    "take a permutation tensor @xmath16 , say , in @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath88 for any @xmath81 .",
    "suppose that the intersection point of the sphere @xmath89 with the line @xmath90 is at @xmath91 . let @xmath92 be the corresponding point of @xmath91 under the antipodal mapping with respect to the center @xmath40 . then @xmath40 is between @xmath16 and @xmath92 , so b can be written as @xmath93 for some @xmath94 . by the above discussion , @xmath95 is in @xmath6 .",
    "that is , every interior point of @xmath28 lies in @xmath6 .",
    "the birkhoff polytope , i.e. , the set of doubly stochastic matrices , is the convex hull of its extreme points - the permutation matrices .",
    "the krein - milman theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) states that every compact convex polytope is the convex hull of its vertices .",
    "a fundamental question of polytope theory is that of an upper ( or lower ) bound for the number of vertices ( or even faces ) . determining the number of vertices ( and faces ) of a given polytope is a computationally difficult problem in general ( see , e.g. , the texts on polytopes @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "m. ahmed et al @xcite gave a lower bound @xmath96 for the number of vertices ( extreme points ) of @xmath28 through an algebraic combinatorial approach .",
    "we present an upper bound and our approach is analytic .      considering @xmath28 defined by ( [ eq11])([eq13 ] ) , we want to know the numbers of independent equations ( lines ) that describe @xmath28 . for each horizontal slice ( an @xmath8 doubly stochastic matrix ) , @xmath99 independent lines are needed and sufficient .",
    "so there are @xmath100 independent horizontal lines from @xmath12 horizontal slices .",
    "now consider the vertical lines , there are @xmath20 of vertical lines .",
    "however , @xmath101 of them , say , on the most right and back , have been determined by the horizontal lines ( as each line sum is 1 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath102 independent vertical lines are needed .",
    "so there are @xmath103 independent lines in total to define the tensor cube .",
    "it follows that we can view @xmath28 defined by ( [ eq11])-([eq13 ] ) as the set of all vectors @xmath104 satisfying @xmath105    we may rewrite ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) respectively as @xmath106 where @xmath16 is a @xmath107 @xmath22 matrix , @xmath108 is the all 1 column vector in @xmath109 , and @xmath40 is an @xmath110 @xmath22 matrix .",
    "let @xmath111 .",
    "a subset of @xmath112 is a convex hull of a finite set if and only if it is a bounded intersection of closed half - spaces @xcite .",
    "the polytope @xmath28 is generated by the @xmath113 half - spaces defined by the linear inequalities @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 be a vertex of @xmath28 .",
    "we claim that at least @xmath119 equalities @xmath120 or 0 hold , where @xmath121 is a row of @xmath16 or row of @xmath40 , that is , @xmath122 , where @xmath91 is a @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) matrix consisting some rows of @xmath16 and some rows of @xmath40 , and @xmath125 is a @xmath22 column vector . if , otherwise , @xmath4 equalities hold for @xmath126 , let @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 is an affine space and @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath91 is a @xmath130 matrix , the affine space @xmath128 has dimension at least @xmath131 .",

    "we arrive at that every extreme point @xmath118 lies on at least @xmath119 supporting hyperplanes @xmath137 in ( [ eq1])([eq4 ] ) that define @xmath28 .",
    "to show the upper bound , we use induction on @xmath12 by reducing the problem to a polytope ( a supporting hyperplane of @xmath28 ) of lower dimensions .",
