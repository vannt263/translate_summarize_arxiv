    "the lennard - jones potential energy problem is to construct the most stable form of @xmath0 atoms of some material with the minimal energy structure .",
    "its form in mathematics is very simple : @xmath8 where @xmath2 , @xmath9 is the coordinates of atom @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "however , it interests many researchers in the field of biology , physics , chemistry , mathematical optimization , computer science , and materials science .",
    "the reason lies in the nonconvexity of the objective function and the huge number of local minima , which is growing exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite tells us the number of distinct local minima of @xmath0-atoms lennard - jones problem is about @xmath10 .",
    "for example , when @xmath116 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 the numbers of distinct local minima of the problem are 2 , 4 , 8 , 18 , 57 , 145 , 366 , 988 respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "from the point of view of numerical optimization methods , this problem is an excellent test problem for local or global optimization methods .",
    "however , the lennard - jones problem is very difficult and challenging to many optimization methods even when @xmath0 is not very large . by now , the best objective function vlues for @xmath12 @xcite are well known . at first",
    ", around 1972 hoare and pal @xcite gave the best values for atoms 5@xmath1316 , 18@xmath1321 , 25 , 26 , 29 , 55 .",
    "then , in 1987 , northby ( @xcite ) made a landmark@xmath14yielding most of the lowest values in the range @xmath15 ; and in 1999 @xcite presented the best results on @xmath16 with the exception of @xmath11192 , 201 @xcite , @xmath04=200 , 300 @xcite , @xmath11185 @xcite , @xmath11186 , 187 @xcite . at present , about thirty percent of northby s results have been improved @xcite .",
    "the improvements are described as follows . in 1994",
    "xue ( @xcite ) got the best values for @xmath1165,66,134 .",
    "doye et al ( @xcite ) in 1995 gave the best values on @xmath0=38,75@xmath1377,102@xmath13104 ; and leary in 1997 ( @xcite ) presented best values for @xmath1169,78,88,107,113,115 .",
    "wolf ( @xcite ) got the best values on @xmath1182 , 84 , 86 , 88 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 , 99 , 100 in 1998 . for the left so - called magic numbers sequence : 17,23,24,72,88 , freeman , farges , wille , coleman , deaven ( @xcite ) got the best results , respectively .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we review the methods in the most important references above - mentioned .",
    "section 3 contains a description of our techniques and methods to tackle problem ( [ ljproblem ] ) ; and results of numerical experiments for the problem are given in this section .",
    "the structure of our optimal solutions is illustrated , and can be compared with those of others , at the end of this section .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "some good summaries on the methods solving the lennard - jones problem in fact can be found in @xcite . in this section",
    "we review the methods in the most important references @xcite .",
    "hoare and pal s work ( @xcite ) may be the early most successful results on lennard - jones problem .",
    "the idea is using build - up technique to construct the initial solutions which are expected to represent low energy states , and using those initial solutions as starting points for a local search method to relax to the optimal solution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the starting seed is the regular unit tetrahedron with atoms at the vertices , the obvious global optimal solution for @xmath17 . beginning with this tetrahedron",
    ", hoare and pal added one atom at a time to construct a sequence of polytetrahedral structures and at last got good results up to @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 its globally optimal trigonal bi - pyramid ( bi - tetrahedron ) structure is gotten by adding an atom at the tetrahedral capping position over a triangular face ; following the bi - tetrahedron structure , the optimal structure of @xmath20 is tri - tetrahedron ( another known optimal structure for @xmath20 is octahedron ( using tetrahedral capping over triangular faces and half - octahedral capping over square faces ) , which is not a polytetrahedron ) ; for @xmath21 its best structure constructed is the pentagonal bi - pyramid , a structure with a five - fold axis of symmetry .",
    "many computer science data structure procedures such as greedy forward growth operator and reverse greedy operator can make the build - up technique work well .",
    "@xcite describes the application of methods of studying noncrystalline clusters to the study of  spherical \" face centred cubic ( fcc ) microcrystallites . @xcite",
    "describes the chief geometrical features of the clustering of small numbers of interacting particles .",
    "the data structure of northby ( @xcite ) in finding the good starting solution is the lattice based structure .",
    "the lattice structures consist of an icosahedral core and particular combinations of surface lattice points .",
    "@xcite first constructed a class of icosahedral packings by adding successively larger icosahedral shells in layers around a core central atom ; this icosahedral lattice can be described as 20 slightly flattened tetrahedrally shaped fcc units with 12 vertices on a sphere centered at the core atom .",
    "atoms within each triangular face are placed in staggered rows in a two dimensional hexagonal close - packed arrangement .",
    "each atom in the interior of a face in a given shell is a tetrahedral capping position relative to three atoms in the underlying shell .",
    "northby relaxed the structure of @xcite to get his ic and fc multilayer icosahedral lattice structures .",
    "the ic lattice can be referred to the fortran code in @xcite ; it consists of all those sites which will comprise the outer shell of the next complete mackay ( @xcite ) icosahedron .",
    "fc lattice is a slight modification of ic lattice in that its outer shell maintains icosahedral symmetry and consists of points at the icosahedral vertices and the stacking fault positions of the outer ic shell .",
    "basing on the ic and fc lattices , northy gave his algorithm first finding a set of lattice local minimizers and then relaxing those lattice minimizers by performing continuous minimization starting with those lattice minimizers .",
    "the algorithm was summarized as algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 of @xcite .",
    "the great majority of the best known solutions of northy are icosahedral in character .",
    "the hybridization of global search and local search methods , usually , is more effective to solve the large scale problem than the global search method or local search method working alone .",
    "catching those two ideas , @xcite combined a genetic algorithm with a stochastic search procedure on icosahedrally derived lattices .",
    "the structures of the optimal solutions gotten in @xcite are either icosahedral or decahedral in character .",
    "the best results of @xcite for @xmath22 were gotten by using a genetic algorithm alone .",
    "deaven et al ( @xcite ) also using the genetic algorithm got the optimal value known for the magic number @xmath23 .",
    "the successful works to improve northby s results ( @xcite ) were mainly done by xue ( @xcite ) , leary ( @xcite ) , and doye et al ( @xcite ) .",
    "xue ( @xcite ) introduced a modified version of the northby algorithm .",
    "he showed that in some cases the relaxation of the outer shell lattice local minimizer with a worse potential function value may lead to a local minimizer with a better value . in northby",
    "s algorithm the lattice search part is a discrete optimization local search procedure , which makes a lattice move to its neighboring lattice with @xmath24 time complexity . in @xcite xue",
    "introduced a simple storage data structure to reduce the time complexity to @xmath25 per move ; and then used a two - level simulated annealing algorithm within the supercomputer cm-5 to be able to solve fastly the lennard - jones problem with sizes as large as 100,000 atoms . in @xcite by employing avl trees ( @xcite ) data structure xue furthermore reduced the time complexity to @xmath26 if nn ( nearest neighbor ) potential function is used .",
    "he ( @xcite ) relaxed _ every _ lattice local minimizer found instead of relaxing only those lattice local minimizers with best known potential function value by a powerful truncated newton local search method , and at last got the best results known for @xmath27 .",
    "leary ( @xcite ) gave a successful big bang algorithm in 1997 for getting the best values known of @xmath28 . in @xcite the fcc lattice structure is discussed and its connections are made with the macrocluster problem .",
    "it is also concluded in @xcite that almost all known exceptions to global optimality of the well - known northby multilayer icosahedral conformations for microclusters are shown to be minor variants of that geometry .",
    "the big bang algorithm contains 3 steps : step 1 is an initial solution generating procedure which randomly generates each coordinate of the initial solution with the independently normal distribution ; step 2 is to generate the new neighborhood solution by discrete - typed fixed step steepest descent method , which is repeated until no further progress is made ; step 3 is to relax the best solution gotten in step 2 by a continuous optimization method@xmath14conjugate gradient method .",
    "doye et al ( @xcite ) investigated the structures of clusters by mapping the structure of the global minimum as a function of both cluster size and the range of the pair potential which is appropriate to the clusters of diatomic molecule , @xmath29 molecule , and the ones between them both .",
    "for the larger clusters the structure of the global minimum changes from icosahedral to decahedral to fcc as the range is decreased ( @xcite ) . in @xcite doye",
    "et al predicted the growth sequences for small decahedral and fcc clusters by maximisation of the number of nn contacts .",
    "lastly , in this section , we give a brief review of methods on the magic numbers @xmath30 and on the exceptions to @xcite .",
    "freeman et al ( @xcite ) presented the best value for @xmath31 when the thermodynamic properties of argon clusters were studied by a combination of classical and quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "the polyicosahedral growth of farges et al ( @xcite ) starts from a 13-atom primitive icosahedron containing a central atom and 12 surface atoms . on each one of the five tetrahedral sites , surrounding a particular vertex ,",
    "a new atom is added and finally a sixth atom is placed on top to create a pentagonal cap . in this way a 19-atom structure being made of double interpenetrating icosahedra , which is a 13-atom icosahedra sharing 9 atoms , is obtained .",
    "i.e. , for three pentagonal bipyramids each one shares an apex with its nearest neighbour . in this way a 23-atom model consisting of three interpenetrating icosahedra is gotten for the best value known .",
    "wille ( @xcite ) used the simulated annealing method yielding low - lying energy states whose distribution depends on the cooling rate to find the best solution known for @xmath32 .",
    "coleman et al ( @xcite ) proposed a build - up process to construct the optimal solution structures .",
    "the hoc ( half octahedral cap ) structure of the optimal solution for @xmath33 is found by a prototype algorithm designed using the anisotropic effective energy simualted annealing method at each build - up stage ( @xcite ) .",
    "wales and doye ( @xcite ) in 1997 gave the lowest values known for @xmath34 .",
    "their method is so - called basin - hopping method , in which first the transformed function @xmath35 was defined and performed starting from @xmath36 by the pr conjugate gradient method ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and then the energy landscape for the function @xmath37 was explored using a canonical monte carlo simulation .",
    "leary ( @xcite ) has developed techniques for moving along sequences of local minima with decreasing energies to arrive at good candidates for global optima and got the best value known on @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we first briefly introduce the discrete gradient method ; then present a hybrid discrete gradient and simulated annealing method .",
    "and then we give some techniques , with the discrete gradient method and the hybrid method , to tackle the lennard - jones problem .",
    "discrete gradient method is a derivative - free local search method for nonsmooth optimization ( @xcite ) .",
    "results of numerical experiments presented in @xcite show that this method can jump over stationary points , which are not local minima , so we can reduce the number of stationary points , which we meet .",
    "details of this method can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "simulated annealing method is a global search method .",
    "it has received a great deal of attention in last several years .",
    "first , this method was applied to combinatorial optimization , i.e. when the objective function is defined in a discrete domain ( see @xcite ) . later",
    "this method was applied to solve continuous global optimization problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "convergence of simulated annealing method is studied , for example , in @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments show that algorithms based on a combination of the global and local search techniques are more effective than the global search methods working alone ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in these methods",
    "a local search algorithm is used to find a stationary point and a global search algorithm is used to escape from this stationary point and to find a new starting point for a local search algorithm . in this subsection , we develop a new hybrid simulated annealing and discrete gradient method . during the whole process of the method ,",
    "both simulated annealing and discrete gradient methods need the the objective function values only .",
    "the simulated annealing method for solving continuous global optimization problems was studied by many authors ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "_ neighborhood solution search _ procedure is one of the important steps in this method .",
    "noticing that the neighborhood solution search for simulated annealing method should be at least based on two basic ideas : ( a ) neighbor means  nearby \" , ( b ) simulated annealing method is a stochastic method so that the neighborhood solution should be randomly taken , we may simply give a neighborhood solution search procedure for simulated annealing algorithm : when the feasible region of the optimization problem is the unit simplex @xmath39 , the neighborhood solution search procedure should be done a little modification :    the hybrid method starts from an initial point , first executes discrete gradient method to find local minimum , then carries on simulated annealing method in order to escape from this local minimum and to find a new starting point for the discrete gradient method .",
    "then we again apply the discrete gradient method starting from the last point and so on until the sequence of the optimal objective function values gotten is convergent .",
    "the pseudo - code of the hybrid method is listed as following :    0.3 cm    algorithm 1 : hybrid simulated annealing and discrete gradient method +   0.4 cm    the convergence of the proposed hybrid method directly follows from the convergence of the simulated annealing and the discrete gradient methods .",
    "the simulated annealing method part consists of two procedures : inner procedure for the search of neighborhood solution and outer procedure for the cooling temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the number of iterations of inner and outer loops are taken to be large enough for guaranteeing that the sufficient iterations will be carried on to escape from the current local minimum . in implementing the hybrid method ,",
    "we use @xmath41 as the temperature annealing schedule and the initial temperature is taken large enough according to the rule in @xcite .",
    "we restrict the number of iterations for the outer procedure by 100 and number of iterations for the inner procedure by 1000 .",
    "the discrete gradient method part is terminated when the distance between the approximation to the subdifferential and origin is less than a given tolerance @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .      in this subsection ,",
    "the proposed discrete gradient method and hybrid discrete gradient and simulated annealing method , with the techniques given in the below , have been applied for minimization of well - known lennard - jones potential function in protein folding problem ( [ ljproblem ] ) .",
    "the nonconvex lennard - jones potential function has a huge number of local minima .",
    "therefore many global optimization techniques fail to minimize it .",
    "the proposed hybrid method fails to solve this problem when number of atoms @xmath44 . in order to reduce the number of local minima we suggest to approximate the function @xmath45 by the following function : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the piecewise linear approximation of the function @xmath48 in segment @xmath49 $ ]",
    ", @xmath50 is the piecewise linear approximation of this function over segment @xmath51 $ ] , and finally @xmath52 is the piecewise linear approximation over @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 is large enough number . here @xmath55{2},~~r_1=1/\\sqrt[3]{2/7}\\ ] ]    such a approximation of the function @xmath48 allows us to remove many local minima of the lennard - jones potential function and to get a good approximation to the global minimum of the objective function @xmath56 in problem ( [ ljproblem ] ) .    in numerical experiments",
    "we take @xmath57 and divide the segment @xmath58 $ ] into 100 segments , the segment @xmath51 $ ] into 100 segments and the @xmath59 $ ] into 50 segments which allows one to get good approximations for the function @xmath48 .",
    "the replacement of the function @xmath48 by the function @xmath60 makes the objective function nonsmooth . on the other side such a replacement",
    "significantly reduce the number of local minima .",
    "since the discrete gradient method is a method of nonsmooth optimization the proposed hybrid method can be applied for solving this transformed problem .",
    "when solving the lennard - jones problem , first we use the discrete gradient method with build - up technique to relax to an initial solution .",
    "then we apply the hybrid discrete gradient and simulated annealing method , with the good approximation for the objective function , to get another initial solution . starting from this initial solution",
    "we again apply the derivative - free discrete gradient method and at last get the global solution .",
    "results of numerical experiments are presented in table [ table1 ] as the appendix .",
    "results from table [ table1 ] show that our techniques and methods effectively solve protein folding problem when number of atoms is not greater than 310 .",
