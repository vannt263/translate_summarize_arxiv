    "one of the big motivations for considering the asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) scenario @xcite is that the abundance of baryon @xmath9 and dark matter ( dm ) @xmath10 is observed to be close to each other @xmath11 . in an adm model @xcite",
    ", there is a common mechanism that might give rise to the baryon asymmetry as well as the adm asymmetry and we obtain @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the adm abundance , the baryon asymmetry , the adm asymmetry , the adm mass and the proton mass , respectively . from this relation ,",
    "the natural scale for adm is around @xmath18 gev , however , mass of the adm can be as low as a few kev in some models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the light non - asymmetric dm ( we call it symmetric dm or simply dm ) , such as mev to gev dm , remains an elusive blind spot in the current underground searches @xcite .",
    "if there are light adm particles , the energy density of radiation at big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch could be changed .",
    "it is not necessary that the particle be a dark matter candidate to influence bbn .",
    "it only need be a thermal relic , e.g. , a particle that was in thermal equilibrium with the standard model particles present when the temperature was compatible with the mass of the relic particle .",
    "these extra particles contribute to the unknown radiation content of the universe @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the relativistic particles at bbn ( as well as at time of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons released ) is usually expressed in terms of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath0 .",
    "for the standard cosmology , @xmath19 is expected . including the effect of slight reheating of the neutrinos from early @xmath20 annihilation , we obtain @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the relation between the symmetric dm at bbn and the effective number of neutrinos is extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the extra particles at bbn contribute to the effective number of neutrinos in the following two cases :    1 .",
    "direct contribution case : if an extra particle is light enough such as ev - scale sterile neutrino , it is regarded as one of the radiation components .",
    "this light particle has contributed directly to the effective number of neutrinos as the so - called dark radiation @xcite .",
    "indirect contribution case : although the extra particles are not light enough to contribute directly to the effective number of neutrinos , its annihilation heats other particles via entropy transfer .",
    "consequently , these extra particles contribute to the effective number of neutrinos indirectly even in the absence of dark radiation . either increase or decrease of the effective number of neutrinos occurs as follows : + \\(i ) if an extra particle couples more strongly to the neutrinos @xmath2 than to the photons @xmath3 and electrons @xmath4 , @xmath5 , its late time annihilation heats the neutrinos more than the photons . ultimately , this type of extra particle yields an excess of the effective number of neutrinos , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "+ \\(ii ) on the contrary , if an extra particle couples more strongly to the electrons and photons than to the neutrinos , @xmath6 , its annihilation heats the electron - photon plasma relative to the neutrino background , leading to a reduction in the effective number of neutrinos below the standard model value , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the relic density of adm in the original models is set by the asymmetry around the time of baryogenesis to obtain the single explanation for both baryon and dark matter densities @xcite .    some scenarios to generate primordial dark and baryon asymmetry in the adm models",
    "are proposed such as lepton - number and/or baryon - number violating decay , the affleck - dine mechanisms , via phase transition at electroweak baryogengesis , scenarios with dark gauge group and messengers between dark and visible sector ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for some of these scenarios , since both dm and anti - dm particles may populate the thermal bath in the early universe , the relic number density of adm is determined not only by the initial number asymmetry but also the annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "this asymmetric wimp framework can accommodate a wide range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross sections .",
    "for example , graesser , et al . applied the asymmetric wimp scenarios to lepton - number violating and baryon - number violating adm models @xcite .",
    "another example is given by lin , et al .",

    ".    the generation mechanism of initial asymmetry , along with ongoing self - annihilation , would be important subject in the study of adm .",
    "we keep the similar mechanism which is proposed in ref.@xcite in mind and we put aside discussion of the particular mechanism to generate the initial asymmetry .",
    "we would like to show a model independent analysis in this asymmetric wimp paradigm .    in the adm scenarios , the adm particle @xmath1 and its antiparticle @xmath26 have nonzero chemical potentials and the particle @xmath1 is not self - conjugate of the antiparticle @xmath26 . to study the dependence of the light adm on the effective number neutrinos , we should take care of the chemical potential of adm .",
