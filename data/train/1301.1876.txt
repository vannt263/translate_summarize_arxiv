    "a linear molecular motor is either a macromolecule or macromolecular complex that moves along a filamentous track @xcite . in spite of its noisy stepping kinetics , on the average ,",
    "it moves in a directed manner .",
    "its mechanical work is fuelled by the input energy which , for many motors , is chemical energy .",
    "the distributions of the dwell times of a motor at discrete positions on its track as well as the duration of many complex motor - driven intracellular processes have been calculated @xcite using the methods of first - passage times @xcite , a well - known formalism in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "experimentally measured distributions of dwell times of a motor can be utilized to extract useful information on its kinetic scheme @xcite .    for motors which can step both forward and backward on a linear track , four distinct conditional dwell times can be defined ; distributions of these four conditional dwell times have been calculated for some motors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a specific molecular motor called dna polymerase ( dnap ) and argue that its movements on the track is characterized by _",
    "nine _ distinct conditional dwell times because of the coupling of its dual roles during its key biological function .",
    "we define these nine conditional dwell times and calculate their distributions analytically treating each of these as an appropriate first - passage time . as a byproduct of this exercise , we obtain an important result , namely , its mean velocity , that characterizes one of its average properties ; the theoretically predicted behaviour is consistent with the corresponding experimental observations reported earlier in the literature .",
    "the distributions of the nine conditional dwell times are new predictions which , we believe , can be tested by single - molecule experiments .    deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) is a polynucleotide , i.e. , a linear heteropolymer whose monomeric subunits are drawn from a pool of four different species of nucleotides , namely , a ( adenine ) , t ( thymine ) , c ( cytosine ) and g ( guanine ) . in this heteropolymer",
    "the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds .",
    "the genetic message is chemically encoded in the sequence of the nucleotide species .",
    "dna polymerase ( dnap ) @xcite , the enzyme that replicates dna , carries out a template - directed polymerization @xcite . during this processes ,",
    "repetitive cycles of nucleotide selection and phosphodiester bond formation is performed to polymerize a dna strand . in every elongation cycle ,",
    "hydrolysis of the substrate molecule supplies sufficient amount of energy to the dnap for performing its function .",
    "therefore , dnaps are also regarded as molecular motor @xcite that transduce chemical energy into mechanical work while translocating step - by - step on the template dna strand that serves as a track for these motors .    in an _ in - vitro _ experiment , wuite et al .",
    "@xcite applied a tension on a ssdna .",
    "the two ends of this dna fragment were connected to two dielectric beads ; one end was held by micro - pipette , while the other end , trapped optically by a laser beam , was pulled .",
    "this dna fragment also served as a template for the replication process carried out by a dnap .",
    "replication converted the ssdna into a dsdna .",
    "the average rate of replication was found to vary _ nonmonotonically _ with the tension applied on the template strand @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained also in the experiments carried out by maier et al .",
    "@xcite , where magnetic tweezers were used to apply the tension on template dna .",
    "the observed nonmonotonic variation of the average rate of replication was explained @xcite as a consequence of the difference in the force - extension curves of ssdna and dsdna @xcite .",
    "fidelity of replication carried out by a dnap is normally very high @xcite .",
    "it achieves such high accuracy by discriminating between the correct and incorrect nucleotides by _",
    "kinetic proofreading_. the mechanism of kinetic proofreading enables the dnap to reduce the error ratio to values far lower than the thermodynamically allowed value of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the free energy difference of enzyme substrate complex for correct and incorrect nucleotides .",
    "thus , dnap is capable of correcting most of its own error during the ongoing replication process itself .",
    "a dnap performs its normal function as a polymerase by catalyzing the elongation of a new ssdna molecule using another ssdna as a template .",
    "however , upon committing a misincorporation of a nucleotide in the elongating dna , the dnap can detect its own error and transfer the nascent dna to another site where it catalyses excision of the wrongly incorporated nucleotide .",
    "the distinct sites , where the polymerisation ( pol ) and exonuclease ( exo ) reactions are catalyzed , are separated by 3 - 4 nm on the same dnap @xcite .",
    "the nascent dna is transferred to the pol site from the exo site after the wrong nucleotide is cleaved from its tip by the dnap .",
    "thus , the transfer of the dna between the pol and exo sites couples the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the dnap .    in the next section",
    "we develop a microscopic model for the replication of a ssdna template that is subjected to externally applied tension @xmath0 , a situation that is very similar to the _ in - vitro _ experiment reported in refs .",
    "the rates of both pol and exo activities of the dnap enter into the expression that we derive for the average rate of elongation of the dna .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of this rate is consistent with the experimental observations reported in @xcite .",
    "we then define 9 distinct conditional dwell times of the dnap and identifying each of these with an appropriate first - passage time @xcite , we calculate their distributions analytically .",
    "we believe that experimental measurements of these distributions are likely to elucidate the nature of the interplay of the pol and exo activities of dnap .",
    "the nucleotides on the template dna are labelled sequentially by the integer index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) which also serves to indicate the position of the dnap on its track .",
    "the chemical ( or conformtional ) state of the dnap is denoted by a discrete variable @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the state of the dnap is during replication is described by the pair @xmath7 .",
    "the kinetic scheme used for our model is adapted from that proposed originally by patel et al . @xcite and",
    "subsequently utilized by various other groups @xcite .",
    "the kinetic scheme of our model is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , where the four different values @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath5 are the allowed chemical states in the polymerase - active mode of the enzyme , while in chemical state @xmath12 the exonuclease catalytic site is activated .",
    "the structure of dna polymerase resembles a `` cupped right hand '' of a human , where its sub domains are recognized as palm , thumb and finger sub domains @xcite .",
    "template dna enters from the finger sub - domain and takes exit from thumb sub - domain . the catalytic site where the binding occurs",
    "is located between finger and palm domain .",
    "transitions between polymerase activated kinetic states of the enzyme ( i.e. , chemical states 1,2 , 3 and 4 ) can be summarized as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the closed and open finger configuration dnap , respectively , while @xmath16 denotes the length of the nascent dna strand .",
    "let us start with the state @xmath17 , labelled by @xmath18 , in which the finger domain of dnap is open and the dnap is located at the site @xmath3 on its template .",
    "now a substrate molecule ( dntp ) binds with the dnap and resulting state @xmath19 is labeled by `` 2 '' .",
    "the transition @xmath20 take place with rate @xmath21 , while corresponding reverse transition @xmath22 occurs with rate @xmath23 .",
    "binding energy of dntp switches the open finger configuration of dnap into closed finger configuration and the corresponding transition 2 @xmath24 @xmath25 3 @xmath26 take place at the rate @xmath27 .",
    "the reverse transition @xmath28 occurs at the rate @xmath29 .",
    "this new closed finger configuration of dnap catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bond between dntp and nascent dna strand thereby elongating the nascent dna from length @xmath3 to @xmath30 ; this process is represented by the transition 3 @xmath26 @xmath31 4 ( @xmath32 ) that occurs at the rate @xmath33 ( @xmath34 being the rate of the reverse transition ) .",
    "finally , the transition @xmath35 @xmath25 @xmath36 completes one elongation cycle ; the corresponding rates of the forward and reverse transitions are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the transition @xmath35 @xmath25 @xmath36 captures more than one sub - step which includes opening of the finger domain , release of @xmath39 and the forward movement of the dnap to the next site on the template .    immediately after completing one elongation cycle ,",
    "the dnap is normally ready to bind with a new substrate molecule and initiate the next elongation cycle .",
    "however , if a wrong nucleotide is incorporated in an elongation cycle , the dnap is likely to transfer the nascent dna from the pol site to the exo site .",
    "this switching from pol to exo activity is represented by the transition @xmath40 which occurs at the rate @xmath41 ; the reverse transition , without cleavage , takes place at the rate @xmath42 . in the exo mode",
    "the cleavage of the last incorporated nucleotide , at the rate @xmath43 , effectively alters the position of the dnap from @xmath30 to @xmath3 .",
    "external load force tilts the free energies and alters the barriers for the forward and reverse transitions @xcite .",
    "but , not all the rate constants change significantly with the tension @xmath0 applied on the template .",
    "we hypothesize that only the following transitions are affected by the tension @xmath0 : ( i ) 3 @xmath25 4 , i.e. , the polymerization step , where new dntp subunit is incorporated into nascent dna chain and a single stranded nucleotide is converted into a double stranded dna .",
    "( ii ) 1 @xmath25 5 i.e. , the transfer of the nascent dna from the pol site to the exo site of the dnap .",
    "these two catalytic sites are separated by 3.5 nm and a transfer of the nascent dna between them includes major change in the dnap conformation that involves a @xmath44 hairpin @xcite .",
    "moreover , polymerase to exonuclease switching causes local melting of the dsdna .",
    "suppose @xmath45 is the _ change _ in the free energy barrier so that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 is the absolute temperature and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the values of the corresponding rate constants in the absence of external force . the symbols @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eqn.([eq - fishkolo ] ) are the load - sharing parameters @xcite .",
    "note that detailed balance is satisfied by our choice of the force - dependence of the rate constants when it is satisfied by the corresponding rates in the absence of the force .",
    "the expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 are derived in appendix a by relating these to @xmath57 which is the change in the stretching free energy when a ssdna is converted into dsdna . as we show in the next section , following force dependence of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 together with @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 , shows a good qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in this subsection we derive the force - velocity curve for our model dnap motor and compare it with those reported earlier in the literature .",

    "frequent @xmath81 @xmath25 @xmath82 switching cause the significant increase in the exonuclease cleaving at higher forces . observed trend of variation of the average velocity is the direct consequence of the nonmonotonic behavior of the @xmath45 , shown in figure ( [ phie ] ) .",
    "the average velocity of a dnap and its dependence on the tension applied on the corresponding template does not provide any information on the intrinsic fluctuations in both the pol and exo activities of these machines .",
    "probing fluctuations in the kinetics of molecular machines have become possible because of the recent advances in single molecule imaging , manipulation and enzymology . in this section",
    "we investigate theoretically how the fluctuations in the pol and exo activities of a dnap would vary with the tension applied on the template dna . for this purpose",
    "we use the same kinetic model introduced in section [ sec - introduction ] , that we have used in subsection [ sec - forcevel ] for calculating the average properties of dnap .",
    "the variable chosen to characterize the fluctuations in replication process is the time of dwell of dnap at a single nucleotide on the template , which is nothing but the effective duration of its stay in that location . while moving on the one dimensional template strand three different mechanical steps",
    "are taken by dnap , which are + ( 1 ) forward step in the pol mode : @xmath35 @xmath25 @xmath36 . + ( 2 ) backward step in the pol mode : @xmath36 @xmath25 @xmath35 .",

    "if a molecular motor takes more than one type of mechanical step then the fluctuations in the durations of its dwell at different locations can not be characterized by a single distribution ; instead , distributions of more than one type of conditional dwell times can be defined @xcite .",
    "so , in the context of our model of dnap , three different types of mechanical step would generate nine different distribution of conditional dwell times .",
    "we denote the forward , backward and cleavage steps are by the symbols @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "@xmath88 is the conditional dwell time of the dna polymerase when step m is followed by n , where the three allowed values of each of the subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 are @xmath91 . for the convenience of calculation of the distributions @xmath88",

    "we first mention a few recently developed single - molecule techniques that probe some aspects of dnap kinetics during replication .    in a landmark paper eid",
    "@xcite reported a single - molecule method for monitoring replication exploiting fluorescently labelled nucleotide monomers .",
    "the fluorophores are `` phospholinked '' ( i.e. , linked to the phosphate group of the nucleotide monomer ) @xcite . since dnap - catalyzed phosphodiester bond formation releases the fluorophore from the nucleotide , the temporal sequence of the color of the fluorescence provides the sequence of the nucleotides that are incorporated in the elongating dna .",
    "christian et al.@xcite have developed a single - molecule technique for monitoring replication by a dnap with base - pair resolution .",
    "this method is based on frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) .",
    "use of this technique also makes it possible to discriminate between the polymerization activity and exonuclease activity of the dnap .",
    "it is likely that in near future appropriate adaptations of these or some combination of force - based and fluorescence - based single molecule techniques may achieve sufficiently high resolution required for measuring the nine distributions of conditional dwell times introduced in this paper .",
    "next , we propose a reduced description of the stochastic pause - and - translocation of the dnap in terms of fewer conditional dwell times which , as we explain below , may be measurable with the currently available single molecule techniques because these do not distinguish between chemical and mechanical backward steppings .",
    "let us define @xmath206 @xmath207 and @xmath208 as the distributions of conditional dwell times in which , regardless of the nature of the next step , the step taken by the dnap is a forward polymerase step @xmath209 , backward polymerase step @xmath210 and backward exonuclease step @xmath211 , respectively .    for a given set of initial conditions , overall probability to leave the @xmath3th site should be unity .",

    "the explicit expressions for @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are given by @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224 where @xmath76s , in terms of the rate constants , are given in appendix b. + we now recast eqn ( [ eq - wtuncond ] ) in a form that would facilitate direct contact with experiments that are feasible with the currently available techniques .",

    "for example , the dnap can move backward either by polymerase or exonuclease activity ; however , the newly defined conditional dwell times @xmath231 does not discriminate between these two modes of backward movement . for the purpose of comparison with experimental data , expressions",

    "the probabilities for a polymerase - dependent forward step ( @xmath85 ) , polymerase - dependent backward step ( @xmath86 ) and exonuclease activity ( @xmath87 ) are 0.9736 , .0261 and .0003 , respectively .",
    "thus , under normal circumstances back - stepping and exonuclease events are very unlikely . moreover ,",
    "two consecutive _ exonuclease _ steps would be extremely rare .",
    "however , the frequency of _ exonuclease _ activity of the dnap can be increased by using mutants of the same dnap . by increasing the concentration of pyrophosphate far above the equilibrium concentration ,",
    "back - stepping events can be made more frequent @xcite .",
    "besides , transfer - deficient mutants and exonuclease - deficient mutants @xcite can be used to test the effects of variation of the corresponding rate constants on the various dwell time distributions .",
    "dna replication is carried out by dnap which operates as a molecular motor utilizing the template dna strand as its track . in this paper",
    "we have presented a theoretical model for dna replication that allows systematic investigation of the pol and exo activities as well as their coupling .",
    "more specifically , the situation considered here mimics an _ in - vitro _ experiment where a tension is applied on the template strand throughout the replication process .",
    "we have calculated the effect of the tension on the average speed of replication , capturing the effects of both the pol and exo activities of the same dnap .",
    "our theoretical results in section [ sec - fvcurve ] are in good qualitative agreement with the results of single molecule experiments reported in the literature @xcite .    however , the intrinsic fluctuations in the pol and exo processes contain some additional information which can not be extracted from average properties .",
    "it is well known that the fluctuation in the dwell times provides a numerical estimate the number of kinetic states @xcite .",
    "more specifically , one defines a `` randomness parameter '' @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the dwell time and the symbol @xmath236 indicates average ; @xmath237 provides a lower bound on the number of kinetic states in each mechano - chemical cycle of the motor . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath238 is larger than unity in any parameter regime , it would indicate existence of branched pathways .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "conditional _ dwell times can reveal existence of correlations between individual steps of the mechano - chemical pathways of a molecular motor @xcite .",
    "besides , hidden substeps may be missed in the noisy data recorded in a single - motor experiment ; the distributions of conditional dwell times are quite useful in detecting such substeps . exact analytical expressions for the distributions of conditional dwell times that we report here may find use in the analysis of the experimental data for extracting these information @xcite .",
    "although both the pol and exo activities of the dnap have been studied extensively @xcite , the distributions of dwell times of dnap have not been measured so far in any single molecule experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have also mentioned a few recently developed single - molecule techniques for dnap @xcite which , after minor alteration , might be the appropriate tool for measuring the conditional dwell times introduced in this paper .",
    "we have also proposed a reduced description of the pause - and - translocation of dnap in terms of the distributions of fewer conditional dwell times which , in principle , can be measured by the currently available single - molecular techniques .",
    "we hope our model and results will motivate experiments to study the unexplored stochastic features of the kinetics of one of the most important genetic processes , namely dna replication driven by dnap .",

    "the physical meaning of this assumption is that the tension - induced change @xmath55 of the barrier arising from the legnth mismatch between the ssdna and dsdna base pairs is equivalent to @xmath90 times the free energy difference @xmath257 .",
    "atomistic explanation of the physical origin of the tension - induced change @xmath255 of the activation energy would require more fine - grained modeling of the local neighborhood of the catalytic site @xcite which is beyond the scope of the markov kinetic models of the type developed in this paper . in our numerical calculations we use @xmath259 which is consistent with the best fit values reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the parameter value @xmath260 should not be confused with the step size of the dnap which is 1 nucleotide .",
    "the polymerase and exonuclease catalytic sites are separated by about 3.5 nm .",
    "a dna molecule migrating from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site of dnap would cause local melting of more than one termial base pairs @xcite .",
    "therefore , based on arguments similar to those used earlier for the rate constant @xmath58 , we now expect @xmath261 . since no further information is available to fix the numerical value of @xmath89 , we use @xmath262 because this choice provides the best fit to the experimenta data @xcite .",
    "wlc model provides a slightly better quantitative estimate of the force extension curve of dsdna in the range of 0 to 10 pn force @xcite .",
    "however , given the uncertainties of the other parameters used for plotting our results graphically , the simpler fjc model is good enough .",
    "indeed , it produces the non monotonicity of @xmath55 as a function of force ( f ) which , in turn , can be used to estimate the mean rate of elongation as well as the conditonal dwell times .",
