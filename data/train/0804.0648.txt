    "generally , new physics can be accessible through rare decays , where the contributions from the standard model ( sm ) are suppressed enough .",
    "hence , such decays can provide an ideal platform to test the sm precisely as well as to bound new physics parameters stringently .",
    "rare decays involving @xmath5 flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) , which are forbidden at the tree level in the standard model , can only be induced by glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism @xcite via loop diagrams .",
    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite elements can be determined quantitatively from @xmath5 rare decays , @xmath6 mixing @xcite etc . , which will test its unitarity under the requirement of the sm .",
    "it is well known that the inclusive decays are relatively robust theoretically , since the decay rate can be systematically and reasonably approximated by the decay of a free @xmath7 quark into light quarks , gluons and photons ; but the counterpart of experimental measurements are quite difficult . on the contrary , the experimental investigations of exclusive decays are comparably easier ; while the theoretical analysis of these modes encounter formidable difficulties due to lack of good understanding of qcd at low energy . as a matter of fact , there have been extensive studies on the exclusive decays of @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite in the literature with varying degrees of theoretical rigor and emphasis .",
    "unlike mesonic decays , the investigations of fcnc @xmath5 transition for bottom baryonic decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 are much behind because more degrees of freedom are involved in the bound state of baryon system at the quark level .",
    "it should be pointed out that such baryonic decays can offer the unique ground to extract the helicity structure of effective hamiltonian for fcnc @xmath5 transition in the sm and beyond , which is lost in the hadronization of meson case . from the viewpoint of experiment , the only drawback of bottom baryon decays",
    "is that the production rate of @xmath12 baryon in @xmath7 quark hadronization is about four times less than that of the @xmath13 meson .",
    "the polarization asymmetry and forward - backward asymmetry in rare decays are very sensitive to the new physics effects beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "for instance , the polarization asymmetry of @xmath2 baryon in @xmath14 decays is dependent heavily on the right - handed current @xcite , which is suppressed in the sm .",
    "however , before claiming the new physics signal , one should have a serious and comprehensive scrutiny of discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical predictions within the sm to confirm whether they are indeed due to contributions from new physics or missing effects in the sm , such as higher power and next - to - leading order corrections , soft gluon effects and so on .",
    "currently , there has been some studies in the literature on @xmath15 transition form factors ranging from phenomenological models including the pole model ( pm ) @xcite , covariant oscillator quark model ( coqm)@xcite , mit bag model ( bm)@xcite and non - relativistic quark model @xcite to qcd sum rule approach ( qcdsr ) @xcite and also perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite .",
    "it can be observed that the available theoretical predictions vary from each other and can differ even by the orders of magnitude .",
    "for instance , the decay width of @xmath3 in pqcd approach is about one to two orders smaller than that obtained within other frameworks .",
    "it is suggested that the soft non - perturbative contribution to the transition form factor can be calculated quantitatively in the framework of light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) approach @xcite , which is a fully relativistic approach and well rooted in quantum field theory , in a systematic and almost model - independent way . as a marriage of standard qcdsr technique @xcite and theory of hard exclusive process @xcite , lcsr cure the problem of qcdsr applying to the large momentum transfer by performing the operator product expansion ( ope ) in terms of twist of the revelent operators rather than their dimension @xcite .",
    "therefore , the principal discrepancy between qcdsr and lcsr consists in that non - perturbative vacuum condensates representing the long - distance quark and gluon interactions in the short - distance expansion are substituted by the light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) describing the distribution of longitudinal momentum carried by the valence quarks of hadronic bound system in the expansion of transverse - distance between partons in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "phenomenologically , lcsr has been widely applied to investigate the transition of mesons and baryons in the recent years , such as bottom meson decays @xcite , electromagnetic form factors of nucleon @xcite , pion electroproduction @xcite , semi - leptonic weak decays of @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , and can make consistent predictions with experimental data successfully .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath18 transition @xcite , @xmath19 transition @xcite , radiative decays of decuplet to octet baryons @xcite and meson - octet baryon couplings @xcite have also been worked out .",
    "lcdas are the fundamental non - perturbative functions in the lcsr , which describes the hadronic structure in rare parton configurations with a fixed number of fock components at small transverse separation in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "there have been continuous interests concentrating on the research of pre - asymptotic corrections to the distribution amplitudes of hadrons in the exclusive reactions over two decades , in an attempt to accommodate the experimental data , such as the electromagnetic form factors of pion and nucleon @xcite . in particular , the lcdas of mesons including higher twist have been investigated extensively @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the meticulous and intensive study of mesonic lcdas , the corresponding task for the baryonic counterpart received less attention in the past due to the complexity of the inner structures for baryon . fortunately , an exciting attempt to study the lcdas of baryon systematically was carried out in @xcite for the first time , where all the transverse degrees of freedom are integrated out and the higher twist distribution amplitudes contributed by the light - ray operators involving `` minus '' components of the quark field operators were investigated in detail .",
    "subsequently , an alternative approach to classify the three - quark light - cone amplitudes of proton was put forward in @xcite , where the transverse degree of freedom of partons is retained and the minus component of field operators are eliminated in favor of the plus and transverse ones with the help of equations of motion .",
    "it is mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that both techniques are probably equivalent . in the present work ,",
    "we would like to follow the prescription presented in @xcite for lcsr approach to study the rare decay of @xmath0 and @xmath20 , which can be also generalized to the decays of @xmath12 to heavier @xmath2 baryons @xcite , once the distribution amplitudes of corresponding baryons are available .",
    "the organization of this paper is as following : in section ii , we collect the effective hamiltonian responsible for fcnc transition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "parameterizations of various hadronic matrix elements @xmath23 with @xmath24 being all the possible lorentz structures are also presented here .",
    "section iii contains the derivation of lcsr for both @xmath0 and @xmath14 decays up to the leading order of @xmath25 with the corrections from higher twists .",
    "we find that the relations between various transition form factors existing in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and large energy effective theory ( leet ) are well respected within the framework of lcsr approach .",
    "the numerical analysis of lcsr for transition form factors are displayed in section iv , where the corrections from the distribution amplitudes of higher twist and comparisons with the results that derived in other methods are investigated at length . in section",
    "v , we apply the available form factors to study the invariant mass distribution of lepton pair , @xmath2 polarization asymmetry and forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath20 together with the decay width and @xmath2 polarization asymmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "we confirm the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath2 polarization asymmetry of @xmath10 is completely independent on the hadronic transition form factors , which makes it a good quantity to study the chiral structure of @xmath26 effective hamiltonian and probe the new physics beyond the sm without receiving any pollution from strong interactions .",
    "numerical results of such observables and comparisons with that obtained in other theoretical methods , in particular qcdsr and pqcd approach , are also included in this section .",
    "section vi is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "integrating out the particles including top quark , @xmath27 and @xmath28 bosons above scale @xmath29 , we arrive at the effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath22 transition @xcite @xmath30 , \\label{effective haniltonian 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected the terms proportional to @xmath31 on account of @xmath32 and the complete list of the operators can be found in @xcite . in the sm , wilson coefficients",
    "@xmath33 at scale @xmath34 calculated in the naive dimensional regularization ( ndr ) scheme are collected in table [ wilson coefficient ] .",
    ".numerical values of wilson coefficients in the ndr scheme at scale @xmath34 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ results of averaged fba ]",
    "the study on rare decay of @xmath0 and @xmath14 can serve as the baryonic counterparts of analysis on @xmath35 @xcite , @xmath36 @xcite and could also be the extension of investigations on heavy baryon decays @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "such decays play the role as a corner stone @xcite to explore the quark - flavor structure of the sm as well as determine its fundamental parameters such as the ckm matrix .",
    "although we have achieved inspiring progress in the heavy meson decays with the help of heavy quark expansions and factorization techniques , serious and systemical studies on heavy baryon decays are comparatively behind on account of the complexity of inner structures for baryon systems .",
    "in particular , the predictions on the physical observables associating with heavy baryon decays can vary even by the orders of magnitude employing different theoretical tools . in this work ,",
    "we explore the soft contributions to the form factors responsible for the @xmath15 transition in terms of lcsr approach to understand the tremendous discrepancy on predictions of decay rate for @xmath0 between theoretical methods .",
    "more importantly , power corrections from the higher twist distribution amplitudes of @xmath2 baryon to the transition form factors are also investigated to the leading conformal spin in detail .",
    "it is observed that the higher twist lcdas almost have no influences on the transition form factors reserving the heavy quark spin symmetry , while such corrections can result in significant impacts on the from factors breaking the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "in addition , we also find that various models for the distribution amplitudes of @xmath2 baryon can lead to quite different predictions on the transition form factors , which will be tested by the experiments on tevatron and lhc in the future .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath2 polarization asymmetry of @xmath10 only relies on the relative strength of left- and right- handed couplings between quarks and is free of the pollution from the strong interaction .",
    "we also discuss some interesting observables in phenomenology , such as decay rate , dilepton distribution , polarization asymmetry and forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath39 .",
    "we use the pole model to extrapolate the results of form factors calculated in lcsr to the whole physical region in view of the failure of light - cone expansion for correlation function in the large momentum transfer region .",
    "our results indicate that the decay rate for @xmath40 is about five times larger than that for @xmath10 due to the long - distance contributions from the charmonium resonance region .",
    "the polarization asymmetry of @xmath41 is much sensitive to the long - distance contributions than that of @xmath42 , since leading resonance @xmath43 does not contribute to the case of final state with tauon pair .",
    "as for the integrated forward - backward asymmetry , our results for the magnitude of both muon and tauon cases are typically one order smaller than that given in qcdsr due to the quite different predictions on the ratio of transition form factors , which can also shift the zero position of forward - backward asymmetry from @xmath44 in lcsr to @xmath45 predicted by qcdsr approach .",
