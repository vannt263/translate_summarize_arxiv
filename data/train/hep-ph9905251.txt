    "@xmath5 processes and other applications were studied in the approach with physically motivated _",
    "ans \" atze _ ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , instead of the solutions of sd equations ( sde ) with specified dynamics . however , the exact evaluation of abelian axial anomaly in the closed form ( [ anomampl ] ) occurs also in the variant where one actually solves sde for the quark propagators and , in a consistent approximation and with the same model interaction , bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations ( bse ) for quark - antiquark bound states .",
    "this is the consistently coupled sd - bs approach , of which @xcite and references therein provide an elaborated example .",
    "since the anomaly is independent of hadronic structure , it is essential to note that the relation ( [ anomampl ] ) is successfully reproduced in the sd approach irrespective of what concrete _ ansatz _ for the quark propagator @xmath6^{-1}~ ,          \\label{quark_propagator}\\ ] ] is used , or what concrete consistently coupled sd - bs solutions are employed for the dressed quark propagator ( [ quark_propagator ] ) and the pion @xmath7 bound - state bs vertex @xmath8 .",
    "the successful treatment of the abelian axial anomaly is possible in the sd approach because this approach incorporates the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath9sb ) into the bound states consistently , so that the pion , although constructed as a @xmath7 bound state , appears as a goldstone boson in the chiral limit . with that",
    ", the bound - state descriptions of mesons are reconciled with chiral requirements stemming both from qcd as underlying fundamental theory , and from phenomenology .",
    "the scenario is essentially of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type , but _ without _ its low cutoff .",
    "consequently , the quark - antiquark bound state mesons can finally provide adequate descriptions of the processes where the axial anomaly is important ( _ e.g. _ , see @xcite ) , such as the two - photon processes of light pseudoscalars , of which the @xmath10 decay is the cleanest example of an anomalous electromagnetic decay .    having gotten in hands the fully satisfactory result ( [ anomampl ] ) for the @xmath10 , the next thing to explore was its one - off - shell - photon extension @xmath11 in the sd approach .",

    "on the other hand , the treatment of the axial anomaly is a strong point of the sd approach , as pointed out above .",
    "what must then be explored in the coupled sd - bs approach is if the large @xmath21 behavior is satisfactory . in particular , the comparison with the new cleo data @xcite  at @xmath21 up to 8 gev@xmath0  must be made .",
    "whether the large @xmath21 behavior is satisfactorily close to the data and to the predictions of pqcd is a tricky question for a constituent quark model .",
    "namely , the calculation of the transition form factor carried out in the simple constituent quark model ( with the constant light  quark mass parameter @xmath24 ) , leads to @xmath25 as @xmath26 , which overshoots both the cleo data and pqcd predictions considerably @xcite .",

    "however , here we give the results over much wider range of @xmath21 - see fig . 1 and the discussion thereof .",
    "comparison with the data reveals in what way more precise measurements at intermediate momenta , feasible at tjnaf , can both give insights in the hadronic structure and provide guidance how to improve presently existing models in the sd - bs approach .",
    "in addition , the coupled sd - bs variant of the sd approach ( such as that in ref .",
    "@xcite ) can readily be extended and applied beyond the soft and chiral limits [ given by eq .",

    "in the coupled sd - bs approach , the bse for the pion bound - state @xmath7 vertex @xmath33 employs the dressed quark propagator ( [ quark_propagator ] ) obtained by solving its sde .",

    "namely , maris and roberts @xcite pointed out that omitting the pseudovector components of the pion lead even to the wrong asymptotic behavior , as @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 , in the case of the charge form factor of the pion . in the present case of the transition form factor ,",
    "the correct @xmath105 leading behavior is nevertheless obtained not only for the results of the full calculation , but also in the soft limit approximation ( [ softlimbs ] ) .",

    "( [ largeq2 ] ) must be reached at some point , although at much higher values of @xmath21 when the mcp vertex is used .",
    "how do our transition form factors agree with other theoretical approaches ?",
    "the vector  meson dominance ( vmd ) model and the qcd sum rule approach @xcite give the transition form factor which is some 10% below our  bc \" @xmath17 for the _ presently _ largest accessible values of @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _ , around 8 gev@xmath0 .",

    "the large-@xmath21 leading power - law behavior ( [ largeq2 ] ) was first derived from the parton picture in the infinite momentum frame  _ e.g. _ , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in this and other similar pqcd approaches , the precise value of the coefficient of the leading @xmath105 term depends on the pion distribution amplitude @xmath110 which should contain the necessary nonperturbative information about the probability that a partonic quark carries the fraction @xmath111 of the total longitudinal momentum .",

    "this is the reason why other approaches and other forms of @xmath110 should be considered even when they do not incorporate the pqcd evolution .",
    "this is in line with radyushkin and ruskov s ( @xcite and their references therein ) pointing out desirability of having direct calculations of @xmath17 without _ a priori _ assumptions about the pion distribution amplitude @xmath118 .",

    "this is practically indistinguishable from the asymptotics indicated by our full numerical calculation of the transition form factor , which reached @xmath170 gev at the largest numerically studied @xmath21 .",
    "it is of special importance that analytically obtained large-@xmath21 asymptotics ( [ ampwtilde ] ) , the derivation of which is valid in both minkowski and euclidean space , makes this smooth and accurate contact between our large-@xmath21 numerical results calculated with the euclidean solutions of the chosen model @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical results confirms the accuracy of our numerical methods and procedures ( employing the euclidean bound - state solutions @xcite ) used in this and earlier papers  @xcite .",

    "therefore , let us for a moment consider again this approximation , although we surpassed it already in ref .",
    "( as a bonus , we also gain understanding of some subtle aspects in its previous applications . ) in fig .  1 ,",
    "the results of the numerical calculation in that approximation , and with the bc vertex ( [ bc - vertex ] ) , are depicted by the dash - dotted line , which practically reaches ( from above ) the asymptotic behavior , although not as fast as the results without that approximation , depicted by the solid line .",

    "so everything tallies .    in the case of the bc vertex , the  soft \" leg adjacent to the pion bs - amplitude always contributes @xmath45 , which enhances the asymptotic value of @xmath101 .",
    "this is not so for the cp or mcp vertices .",

    "( one should also keep in mind that the multiplication by @xmath21 serves only for exposing the asymptotics more clearly , and that the difference is even smaller for @xmath17 proper , which must in every case decrease as @xmath105 . )",

    "this curve illustrates how the heights of the curves depicting @xmath101 depend on how much the @xmath45-profile exceeds 1 .",
    "obviously , for both the solid curve and the dashed one , the agreement with experiment would be improved by lowering them somewhat ( at least in the momentum region @xmath190{$<$ } } \\put(.7,-0.3){\\makebox(0.0,1.)[b]{$\\sim$ } } \\end{picture}4}$ ] gev ) , which could be achieved by modifying the model @xcite and/or its parameters so that such a new solution for @xmath45 is somewhat lowered towards its asymptotic value @xmath191 .",
    "( of course , in order to be significant , this must not be a specialized re - fitting aimed _ only _ at @xmath45 .",
    "lowering of @xmath45 must be a result of a broad fit to many meson properties , comparable to the original fit @xcite .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this paper . )    by the same token , high precision measurements of @xmath17 ( such as those planned at jefferson lab @xcite ) can be especially helpful in obtaining information on @xmath45 empirically .",
    "first note that fig .",
    "3 reveals that in the region around @xmath192 gev@xmath0 we are already in the regime where the dependence on the bs - amplitude @xmath9 is lumped into @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , high - precision measurements of @xmath17 in the region close to the asymptotic regime will give information on the integrated strength of @xmath45 although not on @xmath45 itself .",
