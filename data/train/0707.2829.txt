    "an increasing number of people believe that our universe is a @xmath0 spacetime which is a @xmath4 spacetime with an extra dimension , such as brane theory@xcite and space - time - matter ( stm ) theory.@xcite in the brane world model , the gravity can freely propagate in all dimensions , while the standard matter particles and forces are confined on the 3-brane .",
    "the @xmath0 brane world with modified gravity is proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp).@xcite there are the brane and bulk einstein terms in the action of dgp model .",
    "it was shown that the dgp model allows for an embedding of the standard friedmann cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric on the brane can entirely be described by the standard friedmann equation plus energy conservation on the brane.@xcite and dick gives an exact metric of @xmath0 bulk .",
    "moreover dgp brane model is used to explain accelerating expansion of universe.@xcite a comprehensive review on dgp cosmology is dished up in ref .  .",
    "in stm theory , the @xmath0 manifold is ricci - flat with @xmath5 while the @xmath4 matter is induced from the @xmath0 vacuum .",
    "this theory is supported by the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite which states that any analytic solution of einstein s equations in @xmath6-dimensions can be locally embedded in a @xmath7-dimensional ricci - flat manifold . a class of @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmological solutions",
    "was firstly presented by liu and mashhoon@xcite and restudied latter by liu and wesson.@xcite this class of solutions is algebraically rich because it contains two arbitrary functions of the time @xmath8 .",
    "the solutions are utilized in cosmology@xcite and are relate to the brane model.@xcite    in this paper , we discuss the correspondence between dgp brane cosmology and @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmology . by studying the solutions in dgp model and @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmology , a clear geometrical property of the integral constant @xmath1",
    "is obtained in dgp brane , and also a constraint is given on a class of solutions in stm theory .",
    "then the evolution of the scale factor @xmath9 and the condition where @xmath9 has a bounce are discussed .",
    "we consider a general five - dimensional spacetime metric . because we are interested in cosmological solutions , the metric is taken as @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is a maximally symmetric @xmath12 metric where @xmath13 parameterizes the spatial curvature . adopting the gaussian normal system gauge @xmath14 , the @xmath0 einstein tensors @xmath15",
    "are @xmath16    firstly , in dgp brane cosmology , the five - dimensional einstein equations take the form as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath0 ricci tensor , @xmath19 is the scalar curvature , @xmath20 is related to the @xmath0 newton s constant @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath0 planck mass .",
    "the stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 contains three parts , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the energy momentum tensor of bulk and brane respectively and @xmath28 is contribution coming from the scalar curvature of the brane . @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are written as @xmath29 where the energy density @xmath30 and pressure @xmath31 of the bulk are independent of the coordinate @xmath32 ; the energy density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 are the function of time .    for @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ g05 ] ) implies @xmath36 from eqs .",
    "( [ g00 ] ) , ( [ g55 ] ) and ( [ gab ] ) , they are obtained@xcite @xmath37 assuming there is nothing in the bulk , they have @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ". then , eqs .",
    "( [ g - rho ] ) and ( [ g - p ] ) are rewritten as@xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two constants . in ref .",
    "[ ] , the author find that the standard friedmann equation holds on the brane is equivalent to the smoothness condition , @xmath42 which means that @xmath43 is smooth across the brane .",
    "so , this leads to @xmath44 .    in order to simplify the previous equations , the gauge @xmath45 is adopted",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ na ] ) , @xmath46 is obtained as @xmath47 by substituting @xmath46 into eq .",
    "( [ i+ ] ) , the constant @xmath1 is rewritten as @xmath48 choosing @xmath49 for the sign of @xmath32 in the direction of increasing scale factor , from eqs .",
    "( [ i ] ) and ( [ n ] ) , they are obtained as @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[a^2(0,t)+(\\dot{a}^2(0,t)+k)y^2 + 2\\sqrt{(\\dot{a}^2(0,t)+k)a^2(0,t)-i}y\\right]^{-1/2}.\\label{n(y , t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the metric components lead to an exact solution of @xmath0 spacetime .",
    "we can find the solution is similar to the bounce solution which is derived from stm theory.@xcite    in the stm theory for the @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmology , the ricci tensor are @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , in term of the @xmath0 einstein tensor @xmath52 , they are @xmath53 the @xmath4 einstein field equations are given as @xmath54 the central idea of stm theory is that ( [ g4 ] ) is a subset of ( [ g0 ] ) with the induced @xmath4 energy - momentum tensor @xmath55 which has the classical properties of matter .    a class of @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmological solutions in stm theory reads@xcite @xmath56@xmath57@xmath58where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two arbitrary functions of time @xmath8 , @xmath62 is the 3d curvature index ( @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 is a constant . because the @xmath0 manifold ( [ line element])-([b ] ) is ricci - flat , we have @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and@xmath67so @xmath64 is related to the @xmath0 curvature.d    comparing ( [ a(y , t ) ] ) with ( [ a ] ) , we find if @xmath68 the bulk solutions will be the same as the ricci - flat solutions .",
    "meanwhile , we can obtain @xmath69 .",
    "in brane theory , the @xmath1 in ( [ a(y , t ) ] ) is only an arbitrary integral constant , while @xmath64 is related to the @xmath0 curvature in the ricci - flat cosmology .",
    "therefore , the constant @xmath1 has a new geometrical property in the brane theory .",
    "the constant @xmath1 is related to the @xmath0 curvature of the @xmath0 bulk . in the ricci - flat solutions , by eqs .",
    "( [ mu - a ] ) and ( [ a - mu ] ) , the relation of arbitrary functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 is given @xmath70 for @xmath71 , the @xmath0 kretschmann invariant in ( [ i-3 ] ) will be @xmath72 . in the braneworld",
    ", @xmath71 leads to @xmath73 . in this case the components of metric in eqs .",
    "( [ a(y , t ) ] ) and ( [ n(y , t ) ] ) are @xmath74 when @xmath75 , the eqs .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) and ( [ n0 ] ) become @xmath76 with the relations @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 , eqs .",
    "( [ a00 ] ) and ( [ n00 ] ) are expressed with @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath80 when @xmath75 and @xmath71 , the relation eq .",
    "( [ mu - nu ] ) becomes @xmath81 and the components of the @xmath0 ricci - flat metric ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are rewritten as @xmath82 obviously , they have the same forms as the ones in brane .",
    "however they have different motivation .",
    "the main difference is that authors adopt different points of view regarding the matter content and dynamics of @xmath4 spacetime in brane and stm theory .",
    "in the dgp model , only one brane is contained and put at the position of @xmath83 , where the evolution of brane universe is described by the scale factor @xmath84 . and",
    "the bulk solution is derived as the equation ( [ a(y , t ) ] ) . however , in the stm theory , our universe is a hypersurface @xmath85 .",
    "so , there is a correspondence between the solution of dgp model and stm theory . in details ,",
    "once the evolution @xmath84 on the dgp brane is set , the evolution of stm universe is described by the scale factor @xmath9 .",
    "for example , we let @xmath86 on the brane , and then derive the scale factor in the stm theory as @xmath87 we calculate the first and second derivative of @xmath9 with respect to time @xmath8 and get @xmath88 considering the eqs .",
    "( [ a. ] ) and ( [ a .. ] ) , if there is a bounce on @xmath85 supersurface in stm cosmology , the necessary condition that @xmath9 has the extremum is @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast , a non - bounce cosmology is @xmath91 and @xmath92 . when @xmath89 , from eq .",
    "( [ a. ] ) , we have @xmath93 for @xmath94 , from eq .",
    "( [ a .. ] ) , we let @xmath95 and get @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 should have minimum when @xmath96 and we name it as a bounce . on the contrary",
    "when @xmath97 , there is non - bounce .",
    "we plot the evolution of the scale factor with @xmath98 when @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "fig.[a - plot ] shows the evolution of the scale factor @xmath9 with different values of @xmath102 and @xmath98 .     with @xmath98 , @xmath103.,width=288 ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the correspondence between dgp brane cosmology and @xmath0 ricci - flat cosmology by researching their exact solutions .",
    "the solutions given by dick in dgp brane are very similar to the bounce solutions in ricci - flat cosmology .",
    "contrasting these two solutions we find these two solutions have the same form when the constant @xmath1 in dgp brane and @xmath64 in ricci - flat cosmology satisfy @xmath69 and the arbitrary functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy ( [ mu - nu ] ) . therefore , in this way , the arbitrary integral constant @xmath1 is endowed with specific geometrical property and it is related to the curvature of @xmath0 bulk . at the same time , the relation of the arbitrary function @xmath2 and @xmath3 in ricci - flat cosmology is obtained .",
    "finally , the evolution of the scale factor @xmath9 in stm cosmology is discussed by giving @xmath84 on the dgp brane .",
    "let @xmath86 in the brane , the evolution of @xmath9 in stm cosmology is determined by @xmath102 with @xmath85 .",
    "we obtain the necessary condition which @xmath9 has the bounce is @xmath96 and @xmath95 . in fig.[a - plot ] , the evolution of the scale factor @xmath9 with @xmath98 is shown with different values of @xmath102 , where @xmath99 corresponds to an uniform speed expansion universe , @xmath104 checks with no bounce , while @xmath101 squares with a bounce universe .",
