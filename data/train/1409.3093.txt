    "a few years ago , aaronson and arkhipov proposed a way based on bosonsampling to demonstrate quantum speed - up without quantum fault - tolerance they conjectured that , on the computational complexity side , achieving an approximate version of bosonsampling , even for a ( complex ) gaussian random matrix , will be computationally hard for classical computers . on the other hand they conjectured that such approximate versions can be achieved when the number of bosons is not very large , but still large enough to demonstrate `` quantum supremacy .

    "theorem [ thm:1 ] suggests that for any fixed amount of noise @xmath41 , noisy bosonsampling can be approximated in @xmath42 and that , as long that @xmath43 , the correlation between bosonsampling and noisy bosonsampling tends to @xmath44 .",
    "we say `` suggests '' rather than `` asserts '' , because when we move from individual permanents to permanental distributions we face two issues .",
    "the first is that averaging the probability of a minor is not identical to averaging the value of permanent - squared : the latter does not take into account the normalization term , which is the weighted sum of squares of permanents for all @xmath4 by @xmath4 minors .",
    "however , we can expect that approximating the normalization term itself is in @xmath42 for a fixed amount of noise , and that when @xmath40 is not too small w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 the normalization term will be highly concentrated so it will have a small effect .",
    "the second issue is that when @xmath40 is not too large w.r.t . @xmath4 a typical permanent for bosonsampling will have repeated columns and this will require an ( interesting ) extensions of our results , which is yet to be done . when @xmath40 is large compared to @xmath45 we will have that the bosonsampling distribution is mainly supported on permanents without repeated columns .",
    "we also note that theorem [ thm:1 ] and its consequences refer to correlation between distributions rather than to the variational @xmath46 ) distance that aaronson and arkhipov discuss .",
    "we expect that when the amount of noise is @xmath47 then @xmath48 and @xmath49 are bounded away in the @xmath50-distance by a constant depending on @xmath51 ( this is suggested but not implied by the correlation estimate of part ( i ) of theorem [ thm:1 ] ) .",
    "we also expect that for every @xmath4 and @xmath40 ( @xmath52 , say ) , when the amount of noise is @xmath47 then the noisy bosonsampling distribution is bounded away from the noiseless bosonsampling distribution in the @xmath50-distance .",
    "while not proven here , we also expect that our results can be extended in the following three directions    1 .",
    "the results apply to other forms of noise like a deletion of @xmath53 of our @xmath4 bosons at random , or modeling the noise based on the `` gates , '' namely the physical operations needed for the implementation , or noise representing `` incomplete interference . ''",
    "the results about noisy permanents extend also to the case of repeated columns .",
    "3 .   noise sensitivity extends to describe the sensitivity of the distribution under small perturbations of the noise parameters .",
    "all in all theorem [ thm:1 ] raises the question of whether , without quantum - fault - tolerance , approximate bosonsampling in aaronson and arkhipov s sense is realistic and whether realistically modeled noisy bosonsampling manifests computational - complexity hardness .",
    "noise sensitivity for squares of permanents and bosonsampling may be manifested even for realistic levels of noise even for small values of @xmath4 and @xmath40 ( say , 10 bosons with 20 modes . ) to this end computer simulations can give a good picture , and , of course , experimental efforts for implementing bosonsampling for three , four , five , and six bosons may also give us good picture on how things scale .",

    "consider the expansion of @xmath19 in terms of hermite polynomials    @xmath68    the values @xmath69 are called the hermite coefficients of @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath70    the following description of the noise operator in terms of hermite expansion is well known :    @xmath71    a class of functions with mean zero @xmath72 is called ( uniformly ) noise - stable if there is a function @xmath73 that tends to zero with @xmath14 such that for every function @xmath19 in the class , @xmath74 a sequence of function @xmath75 ( with mean zero ) is asymptotically noise - sensitive if for every @xmath62 @xmath76    these notions are mainly applied for characteristic functions of events ( after subtracting their mean value ) .",
    "there are several issues arising when we move to general functions .",
    "in particular , we can consider these notions w.r.t .",
    "other norms .",
    "noise - stability is equivalent to the assertion that most of the @xmath29-norm of every @xmath77 is given by low - degree hermite - coefficients .",

    "this gives that the expected value of the permanent squared is @xmath79 .",
    "the permanent is thus very `` noise - sensitive '' .",

    "remark : * questions regarding noise sensitivity of various invariants of random matrices were raised by itai benjamini in the late 90s , see @xcite section 3.5.11 .",

    "denote by qsample the class of probability distributions that quantum computers can sample in polynomial time .",
    "aaronson and arkhipov @xcite , and bremner , jozsa , and shepherd @xcite proved that if qsample can be performed by classical computers then the computational - complexity polynomial hierarchy ( ph , for short ) collapses .",
    "aaronson and arkhipov result applies already for bosonsampling .",
    "these important computational - complexity results follow and sharpen older result by terhal and divincenzo @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of aaronson and arkhipov @xcite was to extend these hardness results to account for the fact that implementations of quantum evolutions are noisy .",
    "the novel aspect of @xcite approach was that they did not attempt to model the noisy evolution leading to the bosonic state but rather made an assumption on the target state , namely that it is close in variation distance to the ideal state .",
    "they also considered the case that the input matrix is gaussian both because it is easier to create experimentally such bosonic states , and because of computational complexity consideration .",
    "they conjecture that approximate bosonsampling for random gaussian input is already computationally hard for classical computers ( namely it already implies ph collapse ) , and show how this conjecture can be derived from two other conjectures : a reasonable conjecture on the distribution of the permanents of random gaussian matrices together with the conjecture that it is # p hard to approximate the permanent of a random gaussian complex matrix .",
    "aaronson and arkhipov proposed bosonsampling as a way to provide strong experimental evidence that the `` extended church - turing hypothesis '' is false .",
    "their hope is that current experimental methods not involving quantum fault - tolerance may enable performing approximate bosonsampling for gaussian matrices for 10 - 30 bosons ( `` but not 1000 bosons '' ) .",
    "this range allows ( exceedingly difficult ) classical simulations and thus the way quantum and classical computational efforts scale could be examined .",
    "`` if that can be done , '' argues aaronson , `` it becomes harder for qc skeptics to maintain that some problem of principle would inevitably prevent scaling to 50 or 100 photons . ''",

    "it turns out that combinatorial argument similar to the one used by aaronson and arkhipov is needed in the case where @xmath33 is a real gaussian matrix , to determine the contribution of the top - degree hermite coefficients of @xmath82 , and this can then be used to compute the contributions of all other degrees .",
