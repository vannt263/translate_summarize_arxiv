    "<S> such deviations from the exponential behavior have been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally , for instance in superconducting qubit systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an electron spin confined in the solid state is affected predominantly by phonons via the spin - orbit interaction @xcite , and by nuclear spins in the host material via the hyperfine interaction . at low temperature , coupling to the nuclear spins is the dominant decoherence source @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this strong coupling leads to an apparent decoherence time @xmath1 of the order of 20 ns when time - averaged over experimental runs , the decoherence time @xmath2 strongly depends on the dynamics in the nuclear spin bath . </S>",
    "<S> this typical nuclear spin dynamics is very slow , because the nuclear spins are only weakly coupled with each other and the bath itself is coupled very weakly to its dissipative environment ( like phonons ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that here , the markovian bloch equations are not valid .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study the dynamics and decoherence of an electron spin in a quantum dot that is coherently driven via pulsed magnetic resonance , and is coupled to a nuclear spin bath with a long correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> we find experimentally that , remarkably , the electron spin oscillates coherently , even when the rabi period is much longer than @xmath3 ns . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the characteristics of the driven electron spin dynamics are unusual . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the rabi oscillations is not exponential but follows a power law and a universal ( parameter independent ) phase shift emerges . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these experimental results with a theoretical expression , derived in the limit of a static nuclear spin bath .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a double quantum dot with one electron in each dot and a static external magnetic field in the z - direction , resulting in a zeeman splitting @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear bath is described by the fermi contact hyperfine interaction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the field generated by the nuclear spins at the position of the electron . for a large but finite number of nuclear spins ( @xmath11 for lateral gaas dots ) @xmath12 is gaussian distributed ( due to the central - limit theorem ) with mean @xmath13 and variance @xmath14 @xcite . for a sufficiently large external magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) , we may neglect the transverse terms @xmath16 of the hyperfine interaction that give rise to electron - nuclear - spin flip - flops ( see below ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is justified because the correlation time of the fluctuations in the nuclear - spin system due to dipole - dipole and hyperfine - mediated interaction between the nuclear spins , which is predicted to be @xmath27s @xcite , is much larger than the timescale for electron spin dynamics considered here ( up to @xmath28s ) . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin state is detected in a regime where electron transport through the double quantum dot occurs via transitions from spin states with one electron in each dot ( denoted as ( 1,1 ) ) to the singlet state @xmath29 with two electrons in the right dot . </S>",

    "<S> these features can both only appear if the nuclear field @xmath26 is static during a time much longer than the rabi period . </S>",
    "<S> this is crucial because only then the driven spin coherence for one fixed value of @xmath26 is fully preserved . because different values of @xmath26 give different oscillation frequencies , the decay is due to averaging over the distribution in @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase shift is closely related to the power - law decay because it also finds its origin in the off - resonant contributions . </S>",

    "<S> we consider driven rabi oscillations of a single electron spin with a power - law decay of @xmath51 that is already valid after a short time @xmath69 ns . </S>",

    "<S> these features are theoretically understood by taking into account the coupling of the spin to the nuclear spin bath , which is static on the timescale of the electron spin evolution time . </S>",
