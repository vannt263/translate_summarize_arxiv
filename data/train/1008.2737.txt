    "after bars , spirals are the most prominent features of galaxy discs . the question of whether the spirals are short- or long - lived features is of major importance to the internal evolution of disc galaxies . in this paper ,",
    "i evaluate the evidence that spirals are transient features that change within a few dynamical times , but are superseded by fresh patterns in a recurrent manner .",
    "we still lack a complete , and widely accepted , theory for the origin of spiral patterns in galaxies .",
    "there is good evidence @xcite that many prominent spiral patterns are found in barred galaxies , or are driven by tidal interactions , or perhaps even dm halo substructure @xcite .",
    "there seems little doubt that a tidally - driven spiral pattern evolves rapidly @xcite , but repeated excitations may be possible @xcite . if bars are long - lived features , as is generally believed ( for a dissenting view see *",
    "* ) , spirals driven by bars could also be long - lived patterns .",
    "however , simulations @xcite suggest that spirals and bars could have differing pattern speeds , which seemed to be supported by observational data @xcite , although the latter group recently changed their minds @xcite !    although many spirals in galaxies could be driven responses , the ubiquity of the spiral phenomenon suggests others are likely to be self - excited features of discs .",
    "in particular , all driving agents can be excluded from @xmath0-body simulations of isolated stellar discs , which continue to manifest spiral patterns that must be self - excited .",
    "a satisfactory theory to account for self - excited spirals has yet to emerge , despite decades of effort ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while all agree spirals are gravitationally - driven variations in the surface density of the old stellar disc , there is no consensus even on the expected lifetimes of the patterns .    here",
    "i first explain why the duration of spiral features is an important issue , and then elaborate on the brief discussion of the lifetimes of spirals presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bt08 , p.  526 ) .",
    "i evaluate four different types of evidence that bear on the question whether spirals are short- or long - lived patterns .",
    "it is not obvious that the rate of evolution of galaxy discs is affected by the lifetimes of the patterns .",
    "it may seem that if the time - averaged amplitude and pitch angle of transient spirals does not differ much from those of a steady long - lived pattern , the rate of change in the distribution of angular momentum and other quantities would be similar .",
    "however , the rate of angular momentum transport by spiral waves is given by the rate at which wave action @xcite is transported at the group velocity @xcite , which can differ from the gravity torque by the advective reynolds stress ( bt08 , appendix j ) , also known as `` lorry transport . ''",
    "thus angular momentum transport is substantially reduced for long - lived patterns that invoke feed - back via the long - wave branch of the dispersion relation @xcite , where the advective term actually reverses the sign of angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "transient spirals do not involve the long - wave branch , and therefore redistribute angular momentum more effectively .    also , @xcite showed that stars are scattered by a slowly changing potential perturbation only near resonances .",
    "more precisely , a spiral potential that grows and decays adiabatically ,  on a time - scale long compared with the orbital and epicyclic periods , will not cause a lasting change to a star s orbit .",
    "lasting changes do arise where wave - particle interactions become important near the resonances .",
    "stars experience secular changes through `` surfing '' on the potential variations at corotation or through a periodic forcing close to their epicyclic frequency at the lindblad resonances .    since exchanges between the stars and the wave",
    "take place at resonances , large changes induced by a long - lived pattern would be confined to a few narrow resonances , the most important of which , the inner lindblad resonance , must be `` shielded '' to avoid fierce damping of the spiral @xcite .",
    "the frequency widths of resonances of a steady wave depend only on the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "but resonances are broader for time - dependent waves , and multiple , short - lived disturbances having a range of pattern speeds change the angular momenta of stars over large parts of the disc .",
    "any mechanism to excite spirals relies on the extraction of angular momentum from stars in the inner disc and its deposition on stars in the outer disc @xcite .",
    "resonant stars of a finite - amplitude wave will change their orbits as a result of these angular momentum exchanges and a spiral wave must decay once the resonances , which are the sources and sinks that excite it , have been exhausted .",
    "@xcite found order unity angular momentum changes would take a few hubble times for a spiral of 20% overdensity with a pitch - angle @xmath1 . but",
    "resonances will be depopulated on a much shorter time - scale for large - amplitude , open spirals , which therefore can not last long if the pattern speed is constant .",
    "note that the lifetime could be lengthened by a changing pattern speed , which would allow the resonances to sweep over the disc .",
    "thus the question of the lifetimes of spirals is of major importance to our understanding of disc evolution .",
    "if , on the one hand , the recurrent transient picture is correct , spirals are the most important agents driving the evolution of galaxy discs : they transport angular momentum , scatter stars into non - circular orbits , and cause radial mixing ( see also  [ indirect ] ) .",
    "long - lived , quasi - steady patterns , on the other hand , which must have moderate amplitude and be tightly wrapped in order to persist , would have a much less significant effect .",
    "near - ir photometric images @xcite reveal that spiral patterns represent large amplitude variations in the surface brightness of the old stellar disc .",
    "@xcite attempt to derive a more faithful mass map from their h - band images by applying a pixel by pixel correction based on population synthesis models for the broad - band colours .",
    "all this work has confirmed that spiral patterns constitute large - amplitude density variations in the total stellar density in the disc , but says nothing about the lifetimes of the features .",
    "velocity maps of galaxies that can resolve inter - arm variations reveal that spiral patterns are associated with organized non - axisymmetric streaming flows @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric potential variations can be estimated by modeling such data @xcite , confirming that spirals are associated with significant potential variations .",
    "but unfortunately , these measurements are again quite insensitive to the lifetimes of the spirals ; the flow pattern is essentially the gas response to the instantaneous potential variation , and its qualitative features are independent of the mechanism that created it ( bt08 , p.  526 ) . since resonances are broader for short - lived waves , the quantitative gas response may depend weakly on the duration of the wave , but any attempt to use this as a discriminant between theories would require an accurate independent estimate of the spiral amplitude .    @xcite and @xcite estimate the gravity torque from the spiral pattern .",
    "if this measurement determines the rate of angular momentum transport , then one can use it to estimate the time scale for significant changes to the initial angular momentum distribution .",
    "if the spiral is long - lived , the gravity torque must be corrected for the advective term (  [ evolv ] ) , which can substantially lengthen the time - scale .",
    "advection is far less important for transient spirals .",
    "while it is of great interest that the angular momentum evolution time scale could be less than a hubble time were spirals to be transient , this measurement again does not discriminate between short- and long - lived spiral patterns .",
    "the `` density wave '' theory of spiral modes (  [ theory].3 ) requires the outer disc to be dynamically cool , in particular toomre s axisymmetric stability parameter should be in the range @xmath2 . in principle",
    ", a direct measurement of a larger value of @xmath3 would cause difficulties for this theory .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to estimate @xmath3 in real discs @xcite , but uncertainties are large because the measurement of the low velocity dispersion in a disc is challenging and the @xmath3 value depends on the disc surface density , which is not tightly constrained .",
    "it should also be noted that the raw @xmath3-value estimated from the stars only may not be the relevant quantity in realistic discs , where the gas component and perhaps also the young stellar population can have a disproportionate effect on the overall responsiveness @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the downstream age distribution of star clusters can be used to determine the origin of a spiral pattern .",
    "however , their method really is a test only of whether the gas that formed the star clusters streamed through the spiral arm at a speed that differs significantly from the local circular speed   merely whether a coherent density wave is present  and does not discriminate between mechanisms for its origin or test for its lifetime .",
    "@xcite generalize the method of @xcite to discs that may have multiple pattern speeds .",
    "they @xcite apply it to co data on a number of galaxies , finding evidence for multiple patterns in several cases . other methods to estimate the pattern speed of spiral arms often make the ( implicit ) assumption that there is a single pattern ; for example , the kinematics of stars formed in spiral arms @xcite , the change in radial flow direction across corotation @xcite , or the change in the pattern of residual velocities @xcite , or brute force modelling @xcite ,  once again , however , the results tell us little about the lifetimes of the patterns .    in summary ,",
    "i concur with bt08 that it is frustratingly difficult to determine the lifetimes of spiral patterns , or the mechanism that gave rise to them , from observations of external galaxies .",
    "however , evidence from the milky way seems to favour the transient spiral picture .",
    "the in - plane velocity components of stars in the solar neighbourhood as revealed by the hipparcos mission @xcite do not have the smooth double gaussian anticipated by k. schwarzschild ( bt08 , p.  321 ) , but instead are characterized by a number of separate streams , with essentially no underlying smooth component @xcite .",
    "the features are too substantial to have simply arisen from groups of stars that were born with similar kinematics @xcite , as confirmed in detailed studies @xcite , and it is clear that the entire  has been sculptured by dynamical processes .    individual features in this distribution have been attributed to resonances with the bar @xcite , or with a spiral pattern @xcite , while other models include both bars and spirals @xcite .",
    "the overall appearance of the velocity distribution was successfully reproduced by @xcite who invoked a succession of short - lived spiral transients .",
    "three distinct mechanisms have been proposed to account for self - excited spiral patterns in disc galaxies .",
    "@xcite propose that spiral features are manifestations of quasi - steady global modes of the underlying disc . @xcite and @xcite argue that , aside from tidal- and bar - driven cases , most spirals are short - lived transient features that are essentially collective _ responses _ to internal density fluctuations within the disc . @xcite",
    "also supposes that spirals are short - lived , but suggests they result from a recurrent cycle of vigorous large - scale modes . here",
    "i give brief summaries of each in turn ; @xcite gives a more detailed review .",
    "swing amplification was first described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite highlighted its importance , which he illustrated with the now classic figure named `` dust - to - ashes '' reproduced in bt08 ( their fig .",
    "it shows the dramatic transient trailing spiral that results from a small input leading disturbance .",
    "@xcite showed that swing - amplification causes the collective response of a disc to a co - orbiting mass clump to be a substantial spiral `` wake . ''",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that a large part of the spiral activity observed in disc galaxies is the collective response of the disc to clumps in the density distribution .",
    "as a spiral wake is the collective response of a disc to an individual co - orbiting perturber , multiple perturbers will create multiple responses that all orbit at different rates .",
    "the behaviour of this polarized disc reveals a changing pattern of trailing spirals , which can equivalently be regarded as swing - amplified noise .",
    "@xcite show that amplified noise arising from the massive disc particles themselves can be understood in the shearing sheet , where the resulting spiral amplitudes are linearly proportional to the input level of shot noise .",
    "this could be a mechanism for `` a swirling hotch - potch of pieces of spiral arms '' @xcite in very gas rich discs , where a high rate of dissipation may be able to maintain the responsiveness of the disc @xcite while the clumpiness of the gas distribution may make the seed noise amplitude unusually high .",
    "however , the spiral structure should be chaotic , with little in the way of clear symmetry expected .",
    "also , it seems likely that spiral amplitudes @xcite are too large to be accounted for by this mechanism in most galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that discs are destabilized by a deficiency of stars over a narrow range of angular momentum ; in a disc without random motion , such a deficiency would be a `` groove . ''",
    "the groove itself is unstable , and the instability becomes a global mode through the vigorous supporting response of the surrounding disc , producing a large - scale spiral instability .",
    "@xcite showed that the linear instability , which is driven from corotation , also develops in discs with random motion , while @xcite showed that the amplitude of the mode was limited by the onset of horseshoe orbits .",
    "@xcite , and earlier @xcite , found that almost any narrow feature in the angular momentum density is destabilizing .",
    "thus the common starting assumption of spiral structure studies , that the underlying disc is featureless and smooth , may throw the spiral baby out with the bathwater .",
    "@xcite showed , in simulations of a low mass disc , that the particles were scattered at the lindblad resonances as each coherent wave decayed , thereby leaving behind an altered distribution function that created the conditions for a new instability .",
    "@xcite described in more detail that each spiral pattern seems to be a strongly unstable true mode of the disc in which it grows ; it lasts for only a few rotations , changing the disc properties as it decays so as to provoke new instabilities of the altered disc having different pattern speeds .",
    "the discovery of resonance scattering among the stars of the solar neighbourhood @xcite suggests that this mechanism may occur in real galaxies .",
    "i am actively engaged in addressing the many details of this picture that remain unclear .",
    "simple models of disc galaxies support many global linear instabilities @xcite .",
    "the bar - forming mode is generally the fastest growing , but has almost no spirality .",
    "these studies are therefore important to understand stability , but do not appear promising for spiral generation .",
    "the `` density wave '' theory for spiral modes , described in detail by @xcite , invokes a more specific galaxy model with a cool outer disc and hot inner disc .",
    "the local stability parameter , @xmath4 @xcite , is postulated to be @xmath5 in the outer disc and to rise steeply to @xmath6 near the centre . under these specific conditions",
    ", bertin & lin find slowly evolving spiral modes that grow by their waser @xcite mechanism .",
    "they invoke shocks in the gas to limit the amplitude of the slowly growing mode , leading to a quasi - steady global spiral pattern . @xcite",
    "present a model of this kind to account for the spiral structure of m81 .",
    "the principal objection to their picture is that it is likely that an outer disc with such a low @xmath3 will support other , more vigorous , collective responses that will quickly alter the background state by heating the outer disc , as i now show .      here",
    "i report simulations designed to test directly whether a galaxy model of the kind invoked by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bllt ) can in fact survive to support the slowly - growing global mode they predict should dominate .",

    "the rotation curve of their model has the form @xmath15 that is independent of the disc contribution .",

    "excluding @xmath34 avoids unbalanced disturbance forces that could arise from a lop - sided mass distribution in a rigid halo ; there are no external perturbations to excite such waves , which are also most unlikely to be self - excited in this low mass disc ( see below ) .",
    "the unchanging axisymmetric central attraction maintains the rotation curve shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the simulations employ the grid code that has been shown to reproduce global modes predicted by linear theory for a number of stellar dynamical models @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , it is clear that the model does not possess any rapidly - growing bi - symmetric instabilities .    .",
    "only one particle in 400 is plotted in order to avoid saturating the images .",
    "multi - arm patterns appear soon after the start .",
    "the grid edge ( outer circle ) has radius @xmath39 and one rotation at @xmath30 is 13 time units . ]    the outcome is completely different when disturbance forces from higher sectoral harmonics are included , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pntsb ] .",
    "irrespective of the number of particles , or whether the particles are positioned carefully on rings ( a quiet start ) or placed at random , the model quickly develops multi - arm spiral patterns that heat the disc , as shown in fig .",
    "[ qplotn ] .",
    "the reason for this different behaviour when higher sectoral harmonics are included is clearly related to swing - amplification , which is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath40 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bt08 ) , where @xmath41 , the smallest wavenumber of axisymmetric jeans instabilities @xcite . in the present model , selected from bllt , this parameter rises steadily with radius from @xmath42 at @xmath43 to @xmath44 at @xmath45 , continuing to higher values farther out .",
    "since the swing - amplifier is vigorous only when @xmath46 in a flat rotation curve , as here , it is pretty much dead at all radii for @xmath31 waves , but vigorous responses are expected for @xmath47 , as we observe .",
    "at three times in a simulation with @xmath48 m particles and sectoral harmonics @xmath49 all active .",
    "the initial @xmath3-profile is that shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] . ]    fig .",
    "[ qtplot ] shows the time evolution of @xmath3 at @xmath50 in three simulations with differing numbers of particles showing that heating of the disc , which coincides with the occurrence of visible spiral patterns , is increasingly delayed as larger numbers of particles are employed .",
    "the principal effect of increasing @xmath0 is to reduce the amplitude of initial density fluctuations .",
    "the swing - amplifier quickly polarizes the disc , creating trailing spiral responses having an amplitude proportional to the input noise signal @xcite .",
    "the larger the particle number the smaller the initial amplitude , and it is clear from fig .",
    "[ qtplot ] that the swing - amplified noise has too small an amplitude to cause heating at first when @xmath51 m .",
    "we do not expect global instabilities in a smooth disc for @xmath52 because small - amplitude disturbances at most reasonable pattern speeds will be damped at an  @xcite .",
    "thus the later increase in the spiral amplitude must be a non - linear effect , perhaps related to the recurrent instability cycle reported by @xcite .",
    "whatever the cause , the similar heating rate and final @xmath3 value is consistent with spiral amplitudes that are independent of @xmath0 at later times .",
    "the origin of multi - arm spiral waves will be followed up in future work .",
    "[ qtplot ] shows that even with @xmath51 m , heating begins after just 15 disc rotations .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case where forces were restricted to @xmath31 where no visible bi - symmetric features appeared in 40 rotations even with the ten times larger seed amplitude implied by 100 times fewer particles .",
    "it should be further noted that real spiral galaxy discs have large star clusters and giant molecular clouds that imply much larger seed density fluctuations than arise from @xmath51 m randomly - placed , equal - mass particles .     at @xmath50 in three simulations with differing numbers of particles .",
    "sectoral harmonics @xmath53 were active in all three cases . ]      while these simulations explicitly test just one of the many models presented in bllt , all the cases that they regard of most interest have strongly sub - maximal discs in order that swing amplification is ineffective for @xmath31 ; this aspect is essential so that the model possess only slowly - growing , tightly - wrapped , bi - symmetric spiral modes .",
    "however , the vigour of the swing - amplifier for @xmath52 makes it inevitable that every one of their galaxy models with a low - mass disk will be subject to stronger activity due to disturbance forces with @xmath52 , which will quickly heat the outer disc and destroy the conditions they require , as just demonstrated .",
    "thus the `` basic state '' invoked by bllt for the modes they favour to account for bi - symmetric spiral patterns could not survive in real discs that permit disturbances of all sectoral harmonics .    as",
    "this conclusion depends largely on the results from simulations , one must worry whether they can be trusted .",
    "the principal source of concern is that the origin of the multi - arm patterns that heat the disc remains obscure .",
    "simulations of this kind over many years @xcite have manifested recurrent multi - arm spiral patterns , and the behaviour has not changed as numerical quality has risen and the codes have passed many tests . however , the possibility that the behaviour could result from some artefact in the simulations can not be excluded altogether until a satisfactory explanation is provided .",
    "note that to doubt the result on these grounds calls into question all simulations of isolated discs over the past 40 years , as well as those that model the formation of disc galaxies .",
    "other possible criticisms , such as the simulations could be unreliable because of gravity softening , particle noise , or the restriction to 2d , are more readily rebutted .",
    "first , the very same code has been shown to reproduce modes predicted from linear stability analyses of other models , as cited above .",
    "also , plummer softening in simulations with particles confined to a plane provides a reasonable allowance for finite disc thickness and anyway the same behaviour persists in simulations of discs with finite thickness @xcite .",
    "further , since the only variation in the behaviour as @xmath0 is increased 100-fold is an increasing delay due to a decreasing seed amplitude , with no other qualitative differences , an argument that simulations can not be trusted because @xmath0 is too small is somewhat threadbare .",
    "one might also worry that the stellar dynamical realization i have created differs from the model that bllt analyzed in the hydrodynamic approximation ",
    "essentially i have replaced pressure in their hydrodynamic calculations with velocity spreads ; a more direct test would require a prediction of a slowly - growing spiral in a stellar - dynamical model .",
    "however , it is hard to see why this minor difference should matter , especially in this case where the dispersion is a small fraction of the orbit speed almost everywhere ; the exception is at the centre where @xmath3 is so large that the disc is ( by design ) dynamically inert .",
    "the simulations here have not , of course , made any allowance for the influence of the gas component , which can offset the heating effects from transient spiral patterns to some extent .",
    "however , @xcite found that simulations that included a very crude form of cooling still settled to @xmath54 .",
    "short - lived recurrent spiral patterns have developed spontaneously in simulations of isolated galaxies , from the first studies by @xcite and @xcite , right through to modern simulations that include more sophisticated physical processes @xcite .",
    "claims of long - lived spiral waves @xcite have mostly been based on simulations of short duration .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a simulation that displayed spiral patterns for @xmath55 rotations , but the existence of some underlying long - lived wave is unclear because the pattern changed from snapshot to snapshot .",
    "other claims are equally doubtful , as i show next .      as ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ pntsz ] shows the evolution computed here , which should be compared with that shown in fig .  2 of z96 .",
    "since the ten times larger number of particles used here lowers the seed amplitude , a little more evolution is needed for the spiral to grow . to make the closest possible comparison , i therefore show snapshots that are spaced at the same time interval , but are shifted later by a little over one disc rotation from the start .",
    "the overall appearance is quite similar ; a strong @xmath31 spiral is developing by time 72 and is perhaps more persistent than that in zhang s calculation , where the spiral has faded more by the last two times .    ,",

    "]    a least - squares fit to these data @xcite , as well as to an expansion of the particle distribution in logarithmic spirals , finds at least four coherent waves with @xmath72 , 0.30 , 0.25 & 0.12 , in rough agreement with the locations of the peaks in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ spctz ] .",
    "these values need to be multiplied by @xmath73 to convert to the frequency unit used by dt94 , and these authors plot pattern speed @xmath74 and not @xmath26 that i measure ; thus the pattern speeds i observe are 0.013 , 0.009 , 0.007 & 0.004 in the units shown in fig .  5 of dt94 , where three waves can also be discerned .",
    "the fastest and most slowly rotating waves in dt94 have similar frequencies to those i observe , but neither intermediate wave corresponds to a feature in their plots .",
    "exact correspondence should not be expected as all these waves are seeded by particle noise .",
    "[ getpot ] confirms that the amplitude of bi - symmetric disturbances rises in the inner disc ( dotted line ) earlier than in the outer disc ( dot - dash line ) .",
    "furthermore , the potential variations fluctuate in amplitude , especially in the inner disc , in a manner characteristic of beats between waves rotating at different pattern speeds , as to be expected from the power spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ spctz ] . were the evolution dominated by a single @xmath31 spiral mode , the temporal evolution in this figure would be smooth and vary synchronously at each radius .",
    "thus `` the bisymmetric spiral '' in this simulation is not a single long - lived pattern , but the superposition of three , or more , waves that each grow and decay .",
    "@xcite argues that this model has a tendency to form a bar , which i have also noticed , and she therefore presents another simulation in which the disc mass is reduced to @xmath61 and the halo mass increased to @xmath75 in order to weaken the tendency to form a bar . as she again claims that this new model supports a long - lived spiral ,",
    "i have also tried to reproduce this slightly different simulation .",
    "as above , i find that the strong , and visually impressive , bi - symmetric disturbance is the superposition of more than two patterns that each do not last long .",
    "in this case the first wave to appear has frequency @xmath76 , but later the two dominant waves have @xmath77 & 0.19 , with also some significant amplitude at @xmath78 .",
    "here i summarize three further arguments that bear indirectly on the question of spiral lifetimes .",
    "all three are related to the effect of spiral activity on the orbits of stars in the disc .",
    "transient spiral activity scatters disc stars away from circular orbits @xcite . as random motion of the disc stars rises",
    ", the collective behaviour that produces spiral patterns is weakened .",
    "thus , in the absence of cooling , spiral activity is self - limiting  it heats the disc to a certain level at which the disc can no longer support spiral patterns .",
    "@xcite showed this explicitly in their simulations , and went on to show that a moderate amount of cooling in the form of fresh stars added to the disc on circular orbits enabled spiral activity to continue `` indefinitely . ''",
    "subsequent work on isolated discs @xcite , as well as modern galaxy formation simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others ) , has confirmed this result in simulations with ever greater realism .",
    "physically , the random motions gained by gas clouds are dissipated in collisions so that they keep moving on near circular orbits .",
    "stars that form from the clouds therefore have similar motions , and a continuous supply of fresh stars on near - circular orbits maintains a responsive stellar distribution that allows spiral activity to continue .",
    "quantitatively , fresh stars added to a disc at the rate of a few every year is sufficient for this purpose .",
    "thus the transient spiral picture offers a natural explanation for the absence of spiral patterns in s0 disc galaxies that have little or no gas and the long - noted correspondence that disc galaxies with significant gas components also manifest spiral patterns .",
    "note that this appealing argument again does not uniquely favour short - lived waves , since @xcite also invoke a gas component both to limit the amplitude of their mildly growing modes and to maintain the dynamically cool outer disc .",
    "it has been clear for some time that the velocity dispersion of disc stars in the solar neighbourhood rises with age @xcite and also , for main sequence stars , with colour @xcite , which is a surrogate for mean age .",
    "the highest velocities can not be produced by cloud scattering @xcite and some other accelerating agent , such as transient spirals , seems to be required .",
    "long - lived spirals , which do not heat the disc nearly as effectively , could not achieve the requisite high velocities .",
    "studies of the metallicities and ages of nearby stars @xcite find that older stars tend to have lower metallicities on average . as it is difficult to estimate the ages of individual stars , the precise form of the relation is still disputed .",
    "however , there seems to be general agreement that there is a spread of metallicities at each age , which is also supported by other studies @xcite .",
    "a metallicity spread amongst coeval stars is inconsistent with a simple chemical evolution model in which the metallicity of the disc rises monotonically in each annular bin , without mixing in the radial direction .",
    "again @xcite and roskar  ( 2008ab ) showed that when the disc supports recurrent transient spirals , the needed radial mixing arises naturally through angular momentum changes at corotation that do not heat the disc .",
    "@xcite developed the first chemical evolution model for the milky way disc to include this radial churning .",
    "the transient nature of the patterns is an essential aspect to produce efficient churning .",
    "the horse - shoe orbits near co - rotation of a large - amplitude spiral cause a single change in the angular momentum if the spiral grows and decays in less than half the ( long ) orbit period _ in the rotating frame_. were the spiral to persist for longer than this , then the exchanges a star experiences at one arm would be undone when the star encounters the next arm , and the star would merely take periodic , equal inward and outward steps in radius leading to no lasting change .",
    "@xcite report substantial mixing due to combined influence of a bar and spirals , but their simulations were of short duration and it is likely the effect is large only as the bar forms .",
    "only recurrent transient patterns , with corotation radii spread at random locations , can cause the home radii of stars to `` diffuse '' across the disc throughout its life .      tremaine ( private communication ) pointed out that transient spirals could co - exist with long - lived patterns .",
    "this possibility could be consistent , for example , with the change in the appearance of spiral patterns between the blue and near - ir passbands @xcite , although these data contain no information about the lifetimes of features of any colour .",
    "the co - existence of short - lived spirals seems inconsistent with the specific mode theory for long - lived patterns proposed by @xcite , since transient waves would heat the outer disc to an extent that must render their proposed mechanism unworkable , as shown in ",
    "[ theory].4 .",
    "however , some other possible ( as yet unknown ) mechanism for long - lived spirals might remain viable .    an observational test for the coexistence of both short- and long - lived patterns would be a daunting challenge . for a well - constructed sample of galaxies , one would have to determine the mean amplitude needed to produce the desired heating and churning by the short - lived patterns , and then show that the mean observed spiral amplitudes , estimated somehow from the passband dependent photometry , would or would not allow an additional significant long - lived spiral component .",
    "the question of the lifetimes of spiral patterns is important because galaxy discs evolve to a much greater extent if spirals are transient than if they are quasi - steady (  [ evolv ] ) . in this paper ,",
    "i have summarized the evidence that bears on the question ; were any one piece decisive , there would have been no need to write this paper . however , i find that the transient picture is favoured by the velocity structure in the solar neighbourhood (  [ observ ] ) and by the behaviour of simulations (   [ theory].4 & [ sims ] ) .",
    "direct observational evidence from external galaxies (  [ observ ] ) is frustratingly inconclusive , largely because our single snapshot view can tell us little about the lifetimes of the patterns or , if self - excited , the mechanism that caused them .",
    "however , the overall appearance of the velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood is most naturally accounted for by a succession of transient spirals , with individual features perhaps being attributable to resonances .    theoretical work (  [ theory ] ) over many decades has pursued the two mutually exclusive views . in their efforts to gain the upper hand ,",
    "the rivalry has spurred great improvements in our understanding of density wave mechanics .",
    "however , neither side has been able to land a knockout blow .",
    "simulations have long manifested short - lived transient features , and i have presented two new results here .",
    "the first , in ",
    "[ theory].4 , shows that galaxy models with cool , low - mass discs of the type proposed by @xcite as likely to manifest long - lived , bi - symmetric spiral patterns will instead heat quickly as a result of short - lived transient spiral patterns with @xmath52 .",
    "while the behaviour in the simulations is not fully understood , swing - amplification gives a clear reason for the preference for higher sectoral harmonic disturbances in low - mass discs .",
    "naturally , my demonstration that the most carefully worked - out theory for long - lived modes may not be viable , does not exclude the possibility of long - lived modes altogether .",
    "i have also shown (  [ sims].1 ) that the most clearly presented case of a long - lived spiral in a simulation is not , in fact , a single spiral mode , but a sequence of a few strong patterns that each have short lifetimes .",
    "thus i am unaware of a credible case of a long - lived spiral in any simulation , and therefore simulation results provide strong support for the transient hypothesis .",
    "the principal reason this is not decisive is that we still do not fully understand the origin of spiral patterns in the simulations .",
    "indirect evidence (  [ indirect ] ) suggests that three quite diverse properties of galaxies are naturally explained by transient spiral waves , but an underlying long - lived wave is a possibility that would be very difficult to exclude observationally .    to hold that spirals are long - lived",
    ", one must also argue , ( 1 ) that significant long - lived spirals underlie the transients that appear to be needed to explain the velocity structure in the solar neighbourhood , the high random motions of old disc stars and radial mixing in discs , ( 2 ) that the long - lived pattern adjusts its rotation rate slowly over time , so that fresh stars become the sources and sinks of angular momentum to drive the pattern , and ( 3 ) that no simulation has yet been able to capture the correct dynamical behaviour of spiral patterns .",
    "however , the entire question of spiral lifetimes will not be settled until a theory of spiral pattern generation , which is supported by observational data and consistent with simulation results , gains wide acceptance .",

    "i also thank scott tremaine for encouragement and for a number of perceptive remarks ."
