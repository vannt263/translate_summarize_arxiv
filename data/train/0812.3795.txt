    "in the first public release of the wmap data , we reported a significant asymmetry of the distribution of large scale power on the sky@xcite .",
    "this finding as well as other statistical anomalies were confirmed by several other authors using other methods @xcite .",
    "some of these have been confirmed again in the 3 and 5 year data @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we found that the independent multipole ranges @xmath4 and @xmath5 were both particularly asymmetric but with two different axes of asymmetry , the former being a galactic north - south asymmetry and the latter being an east - west asymmetry . using the full range @xmath0 we found the highest significance of the asymmetry with the axis pointing in the direction of @xmath6 in galactic co - latitude and longitude ( this is the convention we will use for all sky positions in this paper ) .",
    "the position of the non - gaussian cold spot found in @xcite is found to be positioned close to the center of the hemisphere with large fluctuation power .",
    "furthermore , the cmb signal also demonstrated non - gaussian statistical properties in the direction where the power spectrum amplitude was low @xcite .",
    "our own attempts to provide an explanation to the asymmetry invoked a class of homogeneous models that include anisotropic expansion ( shear ) and global rotation ( vorticity ) - the bianchi type viih models@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this fails as a physical explanation@xcite since the best - fit parameter space is then inconsistent with a wide range of other evidence .",
    "recent theoretical developments@xcite have proposed new mechanisms for generating the imprint of a preferred direction in the cmb .",
    "some of these models would lead to hemispherical asymmetry also for multipoles much larger than @xmath7 ( angular scales smaller than 5 degrees ) .",
    "a recent analysis@xcite of the ackerman et al .",
    "model indicates a good fit to the wmap data up to a multipole moment @xmath8 .",
    "however , this model is not able to address the issue of the hemispherical power asymmetry .    in this paper",
    "we reinvestigate the nature of the power asymmetry using the recent 5 year data release from wmap @xcite , and specifically assess whether the signal manifests itself on smaller angular scales @xmath9 . instead of randomly searching for an asymmetry in arbitrary multipole ranges ,",
    "we adopt a model selection procedure that searches for the best fit asymmetry direction and multipole interval .",
    "an asymmetric model of the cmb needs more free parameters ( i.e. direction of the axis of asymmetry ) than a simpler isotropic model .",
    "the model selection procedure tests whether an asymmetric model of the cmb is actually preferred by the data taking into account the introduction of additional free parameters .",
    "we introduce a set of general asymmetric models with three to five additional parameters .",
    "these models are not based on any physical theory but are rather general parametrization of hemispherical asymmetry .",
    "we use these models in order to investigate how the asymmetry is distributed in harmonic space as well as on the sphere .",
    "in section [ sect : data ] we describe the data and masks used in the analysis .",
    "the methods used to assess the asymmetry are outlined in section [ sect : method ] . in section [",
    "sect : res ] we show the results of the isotropy tests applied to the 5 year wmap data and in section [ sect : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "the analysis in this paper was performed using the 5 year release of the wmap data ( publicly available at the lambda web site ) as well as a large ensemble of simulated maps of each channel q ( 41ghz ) , v ( 61ghz ) and w ( 94ghz ) ( the result for each channel is obtained by taking the mean of all das for each channel ) . from all maps , we have subtracted the best fit mono- and dipole .",
    "some tests are also performed on maps from single das and single years of observation .",
    "a series of galactic masks are used in the analysis :    * * kq85 * : the wmap kq85 cut with point source mask .",
    "sky fraction used : 82% * * kq75 * : the wmap kq75 cut with point source mask .",
    "sky fraction used : 72% * * kq75 ext . * : the kq75 cut extended with 5 degrees along the rim of the galaxy .",
    "point source mask unchanged .",
    "sky fraction used : 63% * * @xmath10 ( sometimes referred to as the 60 degree cut ) * : same as the extended kq75 mask , but with an additional 60 degree band cut on the galactic equator .",

    "in @xcite , we estimated the power spectrum on hemispheres centered on 164 different positions on the sphere . in that analysis",
    ", we applied the gabor transform approach @xcite . in order to speed up the analysis without significant loss of precision",
    ", we will here apply the much faster master algorithm @xcite .",
    "this allows the analysis of many more positions on the sphere as well as a large number of simulations for each wmap year of observation and each channel .",
    "the power spectrum is estimated from the pseudo power spectrum by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spherical harmonic transform of channel @xmath13 with a given mask , @xmath14 is the corresponding pseudo power spectrum and @xmath15 is the noise power spectrum .",
    "the coupling kernel @xmath16 depends on the mask applied to the data as detailed in @xcite . in previous works we only used the auto - spectra ,",
    "i.e. @xmath17 . here we will also use the cross power spectra @xmath18 as an additional check . in the previous papers , we estimated the power spectrum on hemispheres centered on 164 different positions on the sphere . here",
    "we use the positions of the 3072 pixel centers in a healpix @xmath19 map .    using the above approach",
    ", we obtain for each multipole bin @xmath20 a @xmath19 map @xmath21 where the value of each pixel @xmath22 corresponds to the @xmath23 power on a hemisphere centered on that pixel . in harmonic space",
    ", we bin the spectrum in 2 multipoles per bin such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the first and last multipoles of bin @xmath20 .",
    "we have also performed tests on more localized spectra , i.e. spectra estimated on disks of various sizes :    * hemispheres ( diameter @xmath26 ) , 2 multipoles per bin , @xmath24 and @xmath25 * @xmath27 diameter disks , 4 multipoles per bin , @xmath28 and @xmath29 * @xmath30 diameter disks , 16 multipoles per bin , @xmath31 and @xmath32 * @xmath33 diameter disks , 16 multipoles per bin , @xmath31 and @xmath32    in analogy to the tests considered in the previous papers @xcite , we tested the asymmetry for different multipole ranges constructing the following map : @xmath34 the max power spectrum ratio for a given multipole range was then defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pixel opposite to @xmath22 .    using the multipole ranges @xmath4 and @xmath37 for which a significant asymmetry was found in previous papers",
    ", we still find a significant asymmetry with a similar direction and significance .",
    "the problem with this approach however , is that the max asymmetry axis as well as the significance is different for different multipole ranges .",
    "we made some attempts to determine whether the asymmetry continues to higher multipoles and if so , what is the highest multipole where the asymmetry is present .",
    "this turned out to be difficult because of the instability of significances and directions as a function of the multipole range .",
    "whether we have a significant asymmetry or not depends on which multipole range we chose to look at . also the axis of asymmetry is slightly different for different multipole ranges .",
    "we will now present an approach which , first of all will solve the problem of choosing which multipole ranges to look at , and secondly will tell us to which degree a complicated asymmetric model is preferred by the data rather than the isotropic model .",
    "the approach is inspired by a similar idea in @xcite .",
    "then in order to understand the results from the model selection method , we will present a second much simpler asymmetry test which is based on testing the alignment of the axes of asymmetry between independent multipole ranges .",
    "we can look at the asymmetry in the following way : the asymmetry is the result of a dipole component in the maps @xmath38 which is common for several multipole bins @xmath20 .",
    "the dipole for a given multipole bin @xmath20 is given by @xmath39 we thus propose the following asymmetric model : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the random dipole expected in an isotropic model and @xmath42 is the common dipole component .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 are assumed to be independent of the bin .",
    "we will allow variations of the asymmetry amplitude @xmath44 with bin . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we will apply a simple @xmath45 fit , @xmath46 where the elements of the data vector @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 for all @xmath49 $ ] and all bins @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath50 is the dipole of the map @xmath38 for the data to be tested .",
    "the elements of the correlation matrix are simply @xmath51 .",
    "we will minimize this @xmath45 with respect to the parameters @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting asymmetry direction is the best fit common dipole component for all bins included in the analysis .",
    "the value of the @xmath45 at the minimum will be compared to the @xmath45 for the isotropic hypothesis , @xmath53 where the elements of @xmath54 are given only by the observed dipole @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath45 improvement @xmath56 due to the additional parameters will be calibrated with a set of isotropic gaussian simulations .",
    "these simulations will give us the expected improvement @xmath57 from the additional parameters to which the @xmath45 improvement in the data can be compared .",
    "if the improvement @xmath57 in the data turns out to be significantly better than in simulations , this would indicate that the asymmetric model is preferred by the data .",
    "we will test three different models for the asymmetry amplitude @xmath58 ,    1 .",
    "constant amplitude : we will test ( a ) a three - parameter model @xmath59 with constant amplitude @xmath60 for a given set of multipole ranges , ( b ) a four - parameter model where the asymmetry is assumed to have the constant amplitude @xmath60 starting at @xmath61 until @xmath62 where the latter is the fourth free parameter , ( c ) a five - parameter model where both the lowest and highest multipoles in the asymmetric multipole range are free parameters .",
    "linearly decreasing amplitude : in this four - parameter model we will assume the asymmetry to be maximal at @xmath61 and decrease linearly according to @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath60 are free parameters . 3 .",
    "gaussian multipole dependence : we will test a model where the asymmetry peaks at a certain multipole @xmath65 and falls off to both sides following a gaussian , @xmath66 . we will test ( a ) a four - parameter model which is assumed to peak at @xmath67 with @xmath68 as free parameter and a five - parameter model where both @xmath65 and @xmath68 are free parameters .    before presenting the results , we will show the procedure that we use to obtain these results .",
    "the following is the procedure that we use in the case of a 5 parameter model with a flat amplitude @xmath60 ( i.e. the amplitude is constant over a multipole range between @xmath69 and @xmath70 and zero for all other multipoles ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model are thus : the two direction angles , the amplitude of the common dipole and the minimum and maximum multipoles of the multipole range where a common dipole component is found ( i.e. where the amplitude is nonzero ) .",
    "the simulations are made with a maximum multipole of @xmath71 , so the maximum and minimum multipoles will be sought within the multipoles available from the simulation in the range from @xmath72 to @xmath71 .",
    "since we will be looking for asymmetry extending over large multipole ranges , we will only look for multipole ranges with a minimum number of @xmath73 multipoles with a common dipole .    1 .",
    "we make two sets of 1400 wmap simulations of a given band with a given mask .",
    "2 .   in each simulation",
    ", we estimate the power spectrum @xmath74 for a hemisphere centered on the center of each pixel @xmath22 in the @xmath19 healpix grid .",
    "we thus obtain 3072 power spectra , one for each direction on the sky up to a multipole @xmath75 . for each simulations we thus have one map @xmath38 for each bin @xmath20 .",
    "we extract the dipole @xmath76 from the map @xmath38 for each bin @xmath20 and each simulation .",
    "we use the first set of simulations to construct the correlation matrix @xmath77 .",
    "5 .   we will now use the second set of simulations : for each simulation , we test all different anisotropic models with different values for the five free parameters , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , dipole amplitude @xmath60 and direction @xmath78 .",
    "we will calculate the @xmath45 ( equation [ eq : chi2 ] ) of the simulated map for all these models and record the parameters of the model with the lowest @xmath45 .",
    "we use the following procedure to minimize the @xmath45 in each simulation : 1 .",
    "we start by making a loop over all possible multipole ranges between @xmath72 and @xmath71 which are the multipoles which we have available .",
    "if for instance @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we will go through all models with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath84 , @xmath87 .",
    "2 .   for each multipole range @xmath88",
    ", we make a loop over a large set of possible values for the model angle @xmath89 .",
    "3 .   for each combination of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath89 ,",
    "we minimize the @xmath45 analytically with respect to the model parameters @xmath90 and @xmath60 .",
    "having found the values @xmath90 and @xmath60 that minimize the @xmath45 we now record the value of the minimum @xmath45 given these three values of the model parameters @xmath91 as well as the best fit values @xmath60 and @xmath90 for this combination of @xmath92 ) .",
    "4 .   after terminating the loop over multipole ranges and directions @xmath89",
    ", we now have a three dimensional array of minimum @xmath45 values .",
    "we search for the minimum value of @xmath45 in this array and thereby obtain the set of model parameters @xmath93 which minimizes the @xmath45 .",
    "we now compare this minimum @xmath45 with the @xmath94 ( equation [ eq : chi2 ] ) obtained assuming the isotropic model .",
    "this difference @xmath95 is recorded for the given simulation .",
    "this value shows the improvement in @xmath45 for this given simulation when using a five - parameter anisotropic model .",
    "after repeating the above procedure for all 1400 simulations , we repeat the same procedure on the wmap data .",
    "we now have an array of @xmath45 improvements from a five - parameter model from all of the simulations as well as for the data .",
    "we now check the @xmath45 improvement of the data with respect to the simulations .",
    "if we quote a significance of @xmath96 it means that @xmath96 of the simulations had a similar or larger improvement of the @xmath45 using the five - parameter model . in the results we will also list the best fit multipole range @xmath97 as well as the amplitude @xmath44 and direction @xmath78 of the common dipole in the data .    the exact procedure described above turned out to have convergence problems .",
    "the number of simulations used to obtain the correlation matrix was too small and caused small instabilities in the best fit parameters .    the number of simulations necessary to get a converged covariance matrix would be too cpu demanding and we therefore chose the following solutions : by increasing the size of the power spectrum bins , the correlations between bins get smaller .",
    "using power spectrum bins of @xmath98 , we found that the correlations can be ignored and only the diagonal part of the correlation matrix is included . with this bin size",
    ", identical results are obtained no matter whether the full correlation matrix or only the diagonal is used .",
    "with smaller bin sizes there was still some dependence on whether the full matrix was used or not . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will therefore only use power spectra averaged in bins of 20 multipoles and a diagonal correlation matrix . only in exceptional cases where we look at small multipole ranges will the bins of two multipoles be used . in this case , this will be clearly stated .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prefdir ] we show the preferred direction for 1400 simulated maps using various galactic cuts .",
    "the plot shows the density of best - fit directions as a function of galactic co - latitude .",
    "the kq85 and kq75 cut show a uniform distribution of best - fit directions whereas for the larger cuts there is a preference for the poles .",
    "thus we would expect that the preferred direction of asymmetry will be shifted away from the galactic plane for large sky cuts .",
    "because of the large cut , power spectra estimated on hemispheres centered close to the poles will be similar in the polar area .",
    "this produces a dipolar structure with an axis pointing towards the poles .     were free parameters and",
    "may thus be different for each simulation .",
    "[ fig : prefdir ] ]      in the results section we will see , using the model selection method described above , that a model with a common dipole component in the range from @xmath1 is preferred by the data with high significance .",
    "there should thus be a strong correlation between the distribution of power in different independent multipole ranges between @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of the alignment test is to check if the asymmetry is distributed over the full multipole range and thus showing up as an alignment of the dipole of the power distribution of different independent multipole ranges .",
    "the idea for the alignment test is simple : we construct the maps @xmath99 where we sum over ( a ) blocks of 20 multipoles and ( b ) blocks of 100 multipoles .",
    "thus for test a , we obtain a set of maps @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 etc . and for test b we obtain @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 etc .",
    "( due to different binning for 45 and 22.5 degree tests , the ranges in test b will be as given in table [ tab : chires4 ] ) .    for each map @xmath106 the dipole is extracted ( by a simple spherical harmonic transform on the map @xmath106 ) and the direction of the dipole",
    "is stored in a vector @xmath107 where @xmath22 is a multipole range @xmath108 . in order to assess whether these directions for different multipole ranges are significantly more aligned in the wmap data than in isotropic simulations ,",
    "we define the mean angular distance @xmath109 as @xmath110 where the sum over @xmath22 and @xmath36 is over subranges@xmath108 up to the maximum multipole for the given case . we will in the following",
    "quantify the alignment of the power distribution in the wmap data by specifying the number of simulations with a lower mean angular distance @xmath109 between the dipoles of the power distribution .",
    "as a first test of the model selection approach , we used the constant amplitude model with @xmath69 and @xmath70 fixed at the ranges @xmath4 and @xmath37 , allowing only the amplitude and direction of asymmetry to vary . in this case",
    ", we found the best fit asymmetry axis to be @xmath111 and @xmath112 being within @xmath113 of the asymmetry axis found in @xcite obtained with the method described in section [ sect : met1 ] .",
    "note that due to the limited multipole range , we use power spectrum bins of two multipoles in this case , ignoring correlations between multipoles . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] we show the distribution of @xmath45 improvements @xmath114 with the three parameters @xmath115 obtained with 1400 isotropic simulated maps .",
    "the vertical line in the plots show @xmath57 for the data .",
    "for @xmath37 we see that only @xmath3 of the simulations have a drop in @xmath45 similar to the drop seen in the data , showing that the anisotropic model is actually preferred by the data . for the multipole range @xmath4 however ,",
    "@xmath116 of the simulations show a similar drop in @xmath45 and this asymmetry is therefore not significant alone taking into account the additional number of parameters required to describe it .     for a three - parameter model with @xmath117 as free parameters for 1400 simulated maps using the wmap v - band parameters with the kq85 galactic cut .",
    "the left plot is for a model with asymmetry in the range @xmath4 , the right plot is for a model with asymmetry in the range @xmath37 .",
    "the horizontal line is the improvement in the @xmath45 for the 5 year wmap data .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] ]    we now allow first @xmath70 ( fixing @xmath118 ) and then later also @xmath69 to be free parameters , i.e. we set the amplitude @xmath44 to a constant value @xmath60 in a multipole range ( @xmath119 and to zero for all other multipoles .",
    "again we measured the drop in @xmath45 by the addition of 4 ( fixing @xmath118 and varying @xmath70 ) and 5 parameters ( varying both @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) for the simulations and compared to the data .    in table [ tab : chires2 ] we show the results for larger scales .",
    "we extracted power spectra up to @xmath120 from wmap simulation of different channels with different galactic cuts .",
    "as we are looking for asymmetric models extending over a large range in multipole space , we restrict our model search to models with at least 10 consecutive multipole bins ( 200 multipoles ) with a common dipole component . the results for the 4-parameter fits ( the four free parameters are the constant amplitude @xmath60 , the direction ( @xmath121 ) and the maximum multipole of asymmetry @xmath70 ) are presented in the table .",
    "the table shows that within the multipole range @xmath122 , there is a dipole component with common amplitude and direction for the multipole range @xmath123 . for the kq85 cut ,",
    "only @xmath124 of the simulations show a similarly strong fit ( similarly large @xmath45 improvement ) for an asymmetric model .",
    "we see that the result is stable with frequency channel .",
    "the significance is dropping with larger galactic cuts , but even with the extended kq75 cut , only @xmath125 of the simulations give a similarly strong fit to an asymmetric model .",
    "even with the largest cut , the direction is remarkably consistent , but note the expected shift away from the galactic plane as discussed above .",
    "the dipole fitting procedure has thus revealed that the hemispherical power asymmetry extends to at least @xmath126 .",
    "the fact that the range @xmath123 is found to be the best fit asymmetric range , does not mean that the asymmetry can not extend beyond @xmath126 .",
    "our model consists of an isotropic field which in our analysis is considered noise and an anisotropic dipole component which is considered the signal . the isotropic noise component to the dipole will randomly change the direction and amplitude of each single power spectrum bin away from the asymmetric direction . by including larger multipole ranges , this noise component is reduced and asymmetries extending over larger multipole ranges even beyond @xmath127 can give a good fit .    from table [ tab : chires2 ] we also see that the best fit asymmetric multipole range is slightly larger for the larger galactic cuts . for kq85 @xmath123 is the best fit asymmetric range whereas for kq75 @xmath128 gives a better fit and for larger cuts even @xmath122 is preferred . as discussed above , the fact that a smaller range @xmath123 gives the best fit for kq85 does not mean that the larger range @xmath128 is a bad fit for this mask . in the table",
    "we have included in parenthesis the significance for @xmath128 for kq85 .",
    "clearly @xmath128 is also significantly asymmetric for kq85 , but because of the random noise component , @xmath123 gives a slightly better fit .",
    "note that we have not included the results of the 5-parameter fits .",
    "the reason for this is that the 5-parameter fit in all these cases show identical best - fit model parameters ( that is , they show that the best fit value for the fifth parameter @xmath69 equals @xmath118 for all cases ) to the 4-parameter fits .",
    "the significances for the 5-parameter model are generally lower than the 4-parameter model even if the best fit parameters are the same .",
    "the reason for this is that significances for the 4-parameter model is calibrated with @xmath45 improvements in 4-parameter fits to isotropic simulations whereas the 5-parameter model is calibrated with @xmath45 improvements in 5-parameter fits to simulations .",
    "the simulations will in general have a larger @xmath45 improvement for a 5-parameter model than a 4-parameter model .",
    "the data however will have the same @xmath45 for a model with exactly the same parameters .",
    "there will therefore be more simulations with a larger @xmath45 improvement for the 5-parameter fit than for the 4-parameter fit even if the @xmath45 of the data is the same .    to investigate properly the maximum multipole for asymmetry ,",
    "we run a set of simulations with @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in order to reduce the cpu time for the @xmath130 case , we now use disks of 90 , 45 and 22.5 degree diameter . in this way",
    "we also obtain more localized spectra .",
    "for the 45 and 22.5 degree disks , we needed to use multipole bins of 16 multipoles in the power spectrum estimation , instead of 20 used in the previous analysis .",
    "for the 22.5 degree disks , the variance of the power spectrum estimate close to the galactic plane was so large that the map @xmath38 needed to be normalized by its standard deviation ( obtained from simulations ) before a dipole fit could be performed . as a result ,",
    "the values for the amplitude obtained in this case is different from the amplitudes obtained for other disk sizes .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : chires3 ] .",
    "the hemisphere results with @xmath129 show that the asymmetry extends to @xmath131 with a similar direction of asymmetry as for lower multipoles but now with a lower significance ( @xmath132 ) . for the more localized spectra however , the asymmetry is found highly significant ( @xmath133 for the most localized spectra ) for the range @xmath1 for all disk sizes , but no evidence is found for an asymmetry extending beyond @xmath134 . in the same table",
    "we also show results for the dipole fit on smaller disks including only multipoles up to @xmath79 in order to check for consistency with the hemisphere results . clearly a consistent dipole fit is found also in this case with more localized power spectra .",
    "finally we will make a consistency check by performing the 5-parameter dipole fit in individual subranges of 100 multipoles from @xmath61 to @xmath135 using 22.5 degree disks .",
    "note that the size of these subranges is not exactly 100 because each power spectrum bin has 16 multipoles . in table [",
    "tab : chires4 ] we show the results .",
    "we see clearly that the best fit direction in each subrange up to @xmath134 is consistent with the best fit direction @xmath136 for the full range @xmath137 for this disk size .",
    "the two bins above @xmath134 however show a very different dipole direction .",
    "we see that the asymmetry can be seen as an alignment of the power distribution dipoles between multipoles from @xmath61 up to @xmath134 .",
