    "confined states offer interesting device applications .",
    "nwsl has an important advantage that the device part and leads can be produced from similar nanowires .",
    "theoretically , nwsl have several interesting issues to be clarified .",
    "in particular , theories derived from planar superlattices to predict band - lineups and model calculations using emt have to be revised for small diameter nwsls .",
