    "new observables involving top quark polarization can be defined such as @xmath8 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the analyzing power of such observables is largest for large values of the polarization of the top quark @xmath9 .",

    "it is , nevertheless , desirable to have a control sample with small polarization of the top quark . in this talk",

    "even if the electroweak couplings @xmath18 are fixed one remains with a three  dimensional parameter space @xmath25 .",
    "however , the polarization formula considerable simplifies at nominal threshold @xmath26 and in the high energy limit @xmath27 .    at threshold and at the born term level one has @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the left - right beam polarization asymmetry",
    "@xmath30 at threshold and @xmath31 is a unit vector pointing into the direction of the electron momentum .",
    "we use a notation where @xmath32 . in terms of the electroweak coupling parameters",
    "@xmath18 , the nominal polarization asymmetry at threshold @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "eq.([thresh ] ) shows that , at threshold and at the born term level , the polarization @xmath35 is parallel to the beam axis irrespective of the scattering angle and has maximal values @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "zero polarization is achieved for @xmath38 .    in the high energy limit",
    "the polarization of the top quark is purely longitudinal , i.e. the polarization points into the direction of the top quark . at the born term level one finds @xmath39 with @xmath40 in the same limit , the electroweak coupling coefficients appearing in ( [ helimit ] ) take the numerical values @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is quite evident that the two limiting cases have quite a different characteristics and different functional behaviour .",
    "the question is whether the two limiting cases can be taken as guiding principles for intermediate energies and for which .",
    "the answer is yes and no , or sometimes .",
    "take , for example , the differential @xmath12 rate which is flat at threshold and shows a strong forward peak in the high energy limit with very little dependence on @xmath19 .",
    "this can be seen by substituting the numerical high energy values of the gauge couplings @xmath18 in the denominator of eq.([helimit ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath45 more detailed calculations show that the strong forward dominance of the rate sets in rather fast above threshold  @xcite .",
    "this is quite welcome since the forward region is favoured from the polarization point of view .    as another example take the vanishing of the polarization which , at threshold , occurs at @xmath46 . in the high energy limit , and in the forward region where the numerator part of ( [ helimit ] ) proportional to @xmath47 dominates",
    ", one finds a polarization zero at @xmath48 .",
    "the two values of @xmath19 do not differ much from another .",
    "let us briefly recall how the effective beam polarization @xmath19 defined in eq.([peff ] ) enters the description of polarized beam effects . consider the rates @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 longitudinally polarized beams .",
    "the rate @xmath52 for partially polarized beams is then given by ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) @xmath53 the rate @xmath52 carries an overall helicity alignment factor @xmath54 which drops out when one calculates the normalized polarization components of the top quark as in eqs.([thresh ] ) and ( [ helimit ] ) .",
    "this explains why the polarization depends only on @xmath19 and not separately on @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "note also that there is another smaller rate enhancement factor in ( [ rate ] ) for negative values of @xmath19 due to the fact that generally @xmath57 .",
    "next consider contour plots @xmath58 in the @xmath59plane as shown in fig.[fig : contour ] .",
    "if one wants large production rates one has to keep to quadrants ii and iv in fig.[fig : contour ] because of the helicity alignment factor @xmath54 in eq.([rate ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : contour ] shows that near maximal values of @xmath19 can be achieved with non - maximal values of @xmath59 .",
    "the two examples shown in fig.[fig : contour ] refer to @xmath60 these two options are at the technical limits what can be can achieved @xcite . in the next section",
    "we shall see that the choice @xmath61 is to be preferred since the polarization is more stable against small variations of @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , a negative value of @xmath19 gives yet another enhancement of the rate  @xcite as also indicated in the denominator of eq.([thresh ] ) and in the rate formula ( [ forrate ] ) .",

    "extrapolations of @xmath9 away from @xmath63 are more stable for @xmath64 than for @xmath65 .",

    "let us summarize our findings .",
    "a. maximal polarization + large values of @xmath35 can be realized for @xmath88 at all intermediate energies .",
    "this is particularly true in the forward region where the rate is highest .",
    "negative large values for @xmath19 with aligned beam helicities ( @xmath89 neg . )",
    "are preferred for two reasons .",
    "first there is a further gain in rate apart from the helicity alignment factor @xmath54 due to the fact that generally @xmath57 as explained after ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "second , the polarization is more stable against variations of @xmath19 .",
    "b. minimal polarization + close to zero values of the polarization vector @xmath35 can be achieved for @xmath90 .",
