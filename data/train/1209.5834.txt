    "this is with a view of making the area of quantum games more accessible to wider mathematical application , as the methods and range of solution concepts of game theory @xcite are used and exploited , without any real need for invoking the hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "the probabilistic approach for a two - player two - strategy game directly uses sets of quantum probabilities corresponding to the measurement outcomes on a two qubit quantum system .",
    "as is known , the setting of generalized einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiments epr , bohm , bell , bell1,bell2,aspect , clausershimony , chsh , cereceda performed on this system leads to the consideration of a set of @xmath0 quantum probabilities .",
    "properties of this probability set have been investigated by cereceda @xcite and it has been pointed out that the chsh form of bell s inequality @xcite can be re - expressed in terms of constraints on the elements from this set . it is observed that only a non - factorizable probability set , as is defined later , can lead to the violation of bell s inequality and that not every non - factorizable probability set violates bell s inequality .",
    "a bayesian game is a game of incomplete information in which the rules of the game are not fully known to all players . in this paper",
    ", we study a bayesian game that is a variant of the well known battle of sexes game , also studied @xcite in the quantum game literature . in an earlier study @xcite , using the quantization protocol based on schmidt decomposition @xcite , a bayesian game of incomplete information @xcite has been investigated in relation to the violation of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "the present paper , however , adopts a different approach in that , without referring to the hilbert space formalism , it finds the outcome of a bayesian game when the considered probability set can be non - factorizable  this can arise , in an experimental situation , from a set up involving quantum entanglement , such as an epr - type experiment , where the chsh form of bell s inequality is violated .    in its normal form representation ,",
    "the game matrix of the bayesian game has the same number of entries as the @xmath0 elements @xmath1 in the probability set that corresponds to the generalized epr experiments cereceda .",
    "we find that the richer structure of the bayesian game permits a natural embedding of the classical factorizable game within the quantum game . we show that , whereas the classical factorizable bayesian game of imperfect information has several nash equilibria , its non - factorizable quantum version obtained from a set of quantum probabilities corresponding to generalized epr experiments has a unique nash equilibrium .",
    "the suggested probabilistic approach to obtaining quantum games thus re - expresses players payoff relations in terms of a set of probabilities that can also arise in a quantum mechanical experiment . as the approach",
    "is based on probabilities only , it does not refer to the formalism of quantum mechanics using state vectors , unitary transformations , and quantum measurements etc .",
    "as game theory is a broad area , with applications ranging from trade , politics , sociology , biology , engineering etc . , most researchers in this area are naturally not familiar with the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "this paper thus fills in that gap and demonstrates how an unusual game - theoretic outcome for a bayesian game results when probability sets that are obtained in quantum mechanical experiments are the underlying probabilities of a bayesian game . in this approach ,",
    "the quantum game reduces itself to the classical game when the considered probability set becomes factorizable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections  2 - 3 present a review of the classical theory of a bayesian game that is a variant of the game of battle of sexes .",
    "section  4 describes quantum probabilities in generalized epr experiments , their constraints , and how within the quantum game the players payoff relations are defined in terms of these probabilities .",
    "section  5 analyses the outcome of the bayesian game of battle of sexes with epr probabilities and section  6 discusses the results .",
    "the game of battle of sexes ( bos ) describes @xcite the following situation .",
    "two people alice and bob wish to go out together and two concerts are available : one with music by bach , and one with music by stravinsky .",
    "one person prefers bach and the other prefers stravinsky . if they go to different concerts , each of them is equally unhappy listening to the music of either composer .",
    "the situation is represented by the following matrix    @xmath2    where bach and stravinsky are represented by symbols @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . for this game ,",
    "a nash equilibrium ( ne ) is a pair of strategies such that each player s strategy is the best reply to the strategic choice of the other players . in other words , unilateral deviation from a nash equilibrium by a player in the form of a different choice of strategy",
    "will produce a payoff that is less than or equal to what a nash equilibrium strategy will give to that player .",
    "analysis shows @xcite that this game has three mixed strategy nash equilibria @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , where the numbers in parentheses are the alice s and bob s probabilities of choosing the strategy @xmath3 .    an interesting variant of this game @xcite is the one in which alice is unsure whether bob prefers to join her or prefers to avoid her , whereas bob knows alice s preferences .",
    "assume that alice thinks that with probability @xmath8 bob wants to go out with her , and with probability @xmath8 bob wants to avoid her ,    @xmath9    that is , from alice s perspective , bob has two possible types , the first is shown on the left and the second is on the right in ( [ bob s two types ] ) .",
    "alice does not know bob s type and is thus faced with the situation of choosing her rational action that is based on her belief about the action of bob of each type . given these beliefs , and her belief about the likelihood of each type , she can calculate her expected payoff in each case . for instance , given that alice plays @xmath3 , and bob of first type ( who wishes to meet alice ) plays @xmath3 whereas bob of second type ( who wishes to avoid alice ) plays @xmath10 , then alice s expected payoff is @xmath11 .",
    "there are @xmath12 possible pairs of actions of bob s two types given as @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here , for instance , @xmath17 describes that bob s first type plays @xmath10 and bob s second type plays @xmath3 .",
    "players expected payoffs are then obtained as given below .",
    "@xmath18    one can then show @xcite that the triplet @xmath19 , where the first entry in the bracket is alice s action @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the pair of actions of the two types of bob , constitutes a nash equilibrium .",
    "this is a pure strategy nash equilibrium consisting of three actions , one for alice and one for each of the two types of bob , with the property that a ) alice s action is optimal given the actions of the two types of bob , b ) the action of each type of bob is optimal given the action of alice .",
    "we now consider a situation in which neither player knows whether the other wants to meet or not @xcite . as before , alice assumes that bob will prefer to join her with probability @xmath8 and will prefer to avoid her with probability @xmath8 . moreover , bob expects with probability @xmath22 alice will prefer to join him and with probability @xmath23 that she will prefer to avoid him .",
    "it is assumed that both alice and bob know their own preferences .",
    "the game can be represented as shown in fig",
    ".  1 @xcite .",
    "consider the payoffs of alice of type @xmath24 .",
    "she believes that with probability @xmath8 she faces bob of type @xmath24 and with probability @xmath25 she faces bob of type @xmath26 .",
    "assume that bob of type @xmath24 chooses @xmath20 and bob of type @xmath26 chooses @xmath10 .",
    "then if alice of type @xmath24 chooses @xmath3 , her expected payoff is @xmath27 and if she chooses @xmath10 , her expected payoff is @xmath28 .",
    "we represent the action of the two types of bob by the pairs @xmath29",
    "@xmath14 @xmath30 @xmath31 , where the first entry in the bracket is the action of bob of type @xmath24 and the second entry is the action of bob of type @xmath32 .",
    "the expected payoff to alice of type @xmath24 when she chooses @xmath3 or @xmath10 , against the @xmath12 pairs of actions of the two types of bob are    @xmath33    and similarly the payoff to alice of type @xmath26 is found as    @xmath34    consider the case when alice of type @xmath24 plays @xmath3 , alice of type @xmath32 plays @xmath10 , bob of type @xmath24 plays @xmath10 , and bob of type @xmath26 plays @xmath3 .",
    "we represent this case by the quadruple @xmath35 where the entries in the first pair are chosen by alice s two types , respectively , and the entries in the second pair are chosen by bob s two types , respectively . for this quadruple , the payoffs to alice s two types can be found from ( [ alicevsbob1],alicevsbob2 ) at the entries located at the intersection of the same column with entry @xmath36 and the two row entries at @xmath37 and @xmath10 corresponding to alice of type @xmath24 and type @xmath26 , respectively :    @xmath38    where the subscripts @xmath24 & @xmath26 for a or b give the type of that player .",
    "the following table gives the expected payoffs to alice s two types against the pairs of actions @xmath39 by bob s two types , respectively    @xmath40    where in the column on the left , for instance , @xmath21 means that alice of type @xmath24 chooses @xmath3 and alice of type @xmath26 chooses @xmath10 .",
    "the two payoff entries in brackets are the expected payoffs to alice of type @xmath24 and type @xmath26 , respectively . in ( [ alice s table ] ) consider the entry @xmath41 at the intersection of @xmath42rd row @xmath36 and @xmath42rd column @xmath36 .",
    "this means that alice of the types @xmath24 and @xmath26 chooses @xmath10 and @xmath20 , respectively , and bob of the types @xmath24 and @xmath26 also chooses @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the payoff to alice of type @xmath24 and type @xmath26 are @xmath8 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the payoffs to bob s two types can be found as    @xmath43    and one can write the expected payoffs to bob s first type as    @xmath44    and , similarly , the expected payoffs to bob s second type are obtained as    @xmath45    as it is the case for payoffs to alice s two types above , ( [ xyz1 ] ) and ( [ xyz2 ] ) can be joined together to obtain the payoffs to bob s two types as    @xmath46    where the entries in brackets are the expected payoffs to bob of type @xmath24 and type @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "now , ( [ alice s table ] ) and ( [ bob s table ] ) can be joined together to obtain    @xmath47    where , for the two pairs of payoff entries , the first pair is for alice s two types and the second payoff pair is for bob s two types .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath48 , for instance , the strategy quadruples @xmath49 and @xmath50 corresponding to the payoff quadruples @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , are the pure strategy bayesian nash equilibria @xcite .      now consider the mixed - strategy version of the game in which the players probabilities of selecting @xmath3 from the pure strategies @xmath37 & @xmath10 are given by numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 $ ] for alice of type @xmath24 , alice of type @xmath26 , bob of type @xmath24 , and for bob of type @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the mixed - strategy payoffs for alice s and bob s two types can then be found from fig .  1 as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is for transpose and the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath26 under a and b refer to the respective player s type .",
    "also , a semicolon is used to separate alice s and bob s variables .",
    "the following nash inequalities are then obtained    @xmath58    where the quadruple @xmath59 is the nash equilibrium strategy set , which is indicated by use of the asterisk label . from the inequalities ( nashequilibria ) , at @xmath48 , for instance ,",
    "the pure bayesian nash equilibria quadruples can be identified as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which correspond to the strategy quadruples @xmath62 and @xmath63 as can be observed above .",
    "also , it is observed that @xmath64 , for instance , is a mixed - strategy bayesian nash equilibrium at which the players payoffs are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ mixedstrategypayoffs ] ) as    @xmath65",
    "the above analysis of mixed - strategy bayesian nash equilibria assumes the underlying probabilities to be factorizable .",
    "we now would like to know whether the outcome of the bayesian game from fig .",
    "1 is affected when the probabilities become non - factorizable . for this",
    "we would consider the set of non - factorizable quantum probabilities obtained from generalized epr experiments .",
    "the standard setting of such experiments epr , bohm , bell , bell1,bell2,aspect , clausershimony , chsh , peres , cereceda involves a large number of runs .",
    "two halves of an epr pair originate from the same source travelling in opposite directions .",
    "one half is received by observer 1 whereas observer 2 receives the other half .",
    "the two observers are space like separated and are unable to communicate .    as fig .",
    "2 shows , the two directions refer to two possible directions along which measurements can be taken and in a run the spin or polarization of the received half is measured .",
    "we call @xmath66 and @xmath67 observer 1 s two directions and @xmath68 and @xmath69 observer 2 s two directions . in a run",
    ", each observer selects one direction and thus a directional pair from @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 is selected by the observers in that run . the stern - gerlach type detectors are now rotated along these selected directions to perform the quantum measurement .",
    "independent of which directional pair is chosen by the two observers , the outcome of the quantum measurement is either @xmath75 or @xmath76 along a measurement direction .",
    "the relevant 16 probabilities are given @xcite in the following ,    @xmath77    where , for instance , when the observer @xmath24 selects the direction @xmath67 and observer @xmath26 selects the direction @xmath68 , and the stern - gerlach detectors are rotated along these directions , the probability that both experimental outcomes are @xmath76 is @xmath78 and the probability that the observer @xmath24 s experimental outcome is @xmath75 and observer @xmath26 s experimental outcome is @xmath76 is given by @xmath79 .",
    "appendix a described how the probabilities @xmath80 are obtained from a pure state of two qubits .",
    "we note that there are @xmath0 probabilities in the above setting of generalized epr experiments and that the fig",
    ".  1 giving a normal form representation of a bayesian game of incomplete information also has the same number of entries in it .",
    "this naturally leads us to consider the situation in which the epr probabilities are taken as the underlying probabilities of the strategy pairs in the bayesian game in fig .  1 .",
    "now , the epr probabilities can become non - factorizable . as we see in the following ,",
    "this consideration motivates us to investigate how the outcome of the bayesian game is affected when the underlying probabilities of this game are obtained from epr experiments and can thus become non - factorizable .",
    "the elements of the probability set @xmath80 @xmath81 are known to satisfy certain other constraints that are described as follows .",
    "note that when the directional pair @xmath70 @xmath82 is chosen for all runs of the experiment , the only possible outcomes are @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "the same is true for other directional pairs @xmath87 @xmath73 @xmath88 .",
    "this leads to the normalization constraint :    @xmath89    also , in a particular run of the epr experiment , the outcome of @xmath75 or @xmath76 ( obtained along the direction @xmath66 or direction @xmath67 ) is independent of whether the direction @xmath68 or the direction @xmath69 is chosen in that run . similarly , the outcome of @xmath75 or @xmath76 ( obtained along @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) is independent of whether the direction @xmath66 or the direction @xmath67 is chosen in that run .",
    "these requirements , when translated in terms of the probability set @xmath90 are expressed as    @xmath91    a convenient solution of the system ( [ normalization ] , localityconstraint ) is reported by cereceda @xcite to be the one for which the set of probabilities @xmath92 is expressed in terms of the remaining set of probabilities @xmath93 that is given as    @xmath94    this allows us to consider the elements of the set @xmath95 as independent variables .    in order to use the epr setting to play the bayesian game in fig .  1",
    ", we call the observers @xmath24 and @xmath26 the players alice and bob , respectively , of the bayesian game .",
    "we then associate one half of the epr pair to the player alice and the other half to the player bob . as alice and bob have two directions each , we associate alice s two directions to the two types of alice .",
    "that is @xmath96alice s type 1 and @xmath97alice s type @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , we associate bob s two directions to the two types of bob .",
    "that is @xmath98bob s type 1 and @xmath99bob s type 2 .    with these associations , and in view of the game in fig .  1 ,",
    "in a run , each of the two directions @xmath66 and @xmath67 is chosen with probability @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , the directions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are chosen with probabilities @xmath101 and @xmath23 , respectively . in view of the payoff relations ( [ mixedstrategypayoffs ] ) in the factorizable game , the players payoff relations in the game with epr probabilities can now be expressed as    @xmath102    where @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the payoffs to alice of type @xmath24 , alice of type @xmath26 , bob of type @xmath24 , and bob of type @xmath26 , respectively , expressed in term of the probabilities @xmath80 that are defined in ( [ table ] ) .",
    "note that the payoffs ( [ eprpayoffs ] ) are reduced to the payoffs in the mixed - strategy game ( [ mixedstrategypayoffs ] ) when the probability set @xmath108 @xmath81 is factorizable in terms of the probabilities @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 $ ] as given by eqs .",
    "( [ factorizability ] ) .",
    "so as to find the nash equilibria when the probability set @xmath80 @xmath81 are non - factorizable , we notice that when @xmath90 are factorizable in terms of the probabilities @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath54 , we can write    @xmath113    with this the payoff relations ( [ eprpayoffs ] ) are reduced to the payoffs given by ( [ mixedstrategypayoffs ] ) . also , when @xmath80 are factorizable , and can be expressed in terms of @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath114 , they satisfy the constraints given by eqs .",
    "( [ normalization ] , [ localityconstraint ] ) and @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath54 can then be expressed in terms of the probabilities @xmath80 as follows    @xmath115    from the set of inequalities ( [ nashequilibria ] ) , the expressions describing the nash equilibria in the factorizable game are    @xmath116    to evaluate these inequalities , we use the relations ( dependentprobabilities ) to express the payoff relations ( [ eprpayoffs ] ) in terms of the elements from the set @xmath95 as follows    @xmath117    similarly , using the relations ( [ dependentprobabilities ] ) , we express @xmath118 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath54 in ( [ re - expressedprobs ] ) in terms of the elements from the set @xmath95 as    @xmath119    this allows us to use the chain rule to evaluate    @xmath120    that gives @xmath121 .",
    "similarly , we obtain    @xmath122    the inequalities ( [ nash ] ) are now written as    @xmath123    giving    @xmath124    as a unique bayesian nash equilibrium of the game . using eqs .",

    "as is well known , bell s inequality presents stark difference between the classical and quantum world .",
    "the chsh form of bell s inequality can be expressed as a constraint on probabilities without referring to the formalism and mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics .",
    "game theory is based on the theory of probability and this suggests that the quantum contents of quantum games can be given an expression that only employ probabilities without referring to the formalism of quantum mechanics . a probabilistic approach to quantum games",
    "is only a matter of perspective as the quantum bayesian game discussed in this paper can be physically implemented using epr type experiments that result in non - factorizable probabilities .",
    "essentially , this paper discusses a physical implementation of a quantum bayesian game using epr experiments .",
    "we find that these experiments provide a natural setting for analyzing a quantum bayesian game .",
    "our analysis uses only probabilities as they facilitate wider access to the area of quantum games .",
    "the physical realization of our game is provided by actual epr experiments where quantum mechanics makes the difference and which can also be expressed in terms of probabilities only .",
    "we study the game of battle of sexes with incomplete information that has both pure and mixed bayesian nash equilibria .",
    "we investigate the situation when the underlying probabilities of this game can become non - factorizable .",
    "as is known , the probabilities in generalized epr experiments can become non - factorizable and in certain cases can maximally violate the corresponding chsh version of bell s inequality . when the quantum mechanical probabilities are factorizable the game attains a classical interpretation .",
    "however , when the probabilities are allowed to become non - factorizable , we find that the solution of the game turns out to be entirely different and , in contrast to the classical game that has both pure and mixed bayesian nash equilibria , the quantum game has a unique bayesian nash equilibrium .",
    "a natural question to ask here is whether any set of probabilities that satisfies the constraints ( [ normalization],[localityconstraint ] ) is physically realizable ?",
    "quantum mechanics is known to impose further constraints and one such constraint is given by the chsh version of bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "this constraint states that the quantity @xmath128 defined by    @xmath129    is restricted in the range @xmath130 by the laws of quantum mechanics and the chsh version of bell s inequality is violated in quantum mechanical experiments when @xmath131 .",
    "these constraints are imposed by physical realizations and a maximum value of @xmath132 emerges when only non - negative probabilities are considered .",
    "it is known that this value is not physically realizable .",
