    "in the last few years , many theoretical , numerical and experimental investigations have appeared for the study of the influence of disorder ( usually quenched site or bond dilution ) on statistical systems in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field , since an experimental sample is not free of disorder , in general .",
    "such systems are randomly dilute uniaxial antiferromagnets , e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , obtained by mixing uniaxial antiferromagnets with non - magnetic materials .",
    "these systems are modelled by using pure systems models modified accordingly .",
    "the most popular models for pure systems are those of ising and potts ; in the current case , the former one shall be used .",
    "the ising model , a favorite for physicists , is used as the prototype for phase transitions , critical phenomena , biological and econophysics , owing to the fact that its two - dimensional version on a square lattice was solved analytically by onsager , @xcite ; it has also become a standard model for testing scaling and universality hypotheses .",
    "the ising model as well as that of potts , heisenberg , baxter - wu , etc .",
    ", represent collective phenomena which are difficult to be solved exactly , except in some cases , consequently approximate methods have been developed to cope with , such as mean field theory , numerical methods , perturbation theory , scaling , renormalization group , monte carlo etc .",
    "the effect of randomness on the critical behavior and magnetic phase diagrams of classical random spin systems has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "randomness is encountered in the form of vacancies , variable bonds , impurities , random fields , etc .",
    "its influence on the critical behavior and magnetic properties is a long - standing and still unsettled problem in statistical physics .",
    "similar methods , as in the pure systems , have been utilized for the study of these systems . in these studies ,",
    "an important question which had arisen was the extent to which randomness influences the critical behavior and magnetic properties .",
    "the first remarkable criterion for the influence of randomness on a critical system was proposed by harris , @xcite , according to which randomness changes the critical behavior if the specific heat critical exponent @xmath2 of the pure system is positive , @xmath9 . in this case a new critical point with conventional power law scaling and new exponents emerges",
    ". however , the pure two - dimensional ising model ( @xmath10d i m ) constitutes a marginal situation since @xmath11 .",
    "this exception makes @xmath10d i m of particular interest attracting much attention . however , this effort led to contradicting results , increasing confusion and revealing the inhibit hidden complexity , implying the need for more subtle approaches to tackle it .",
    "the @xmath10d i m consists of an array of @xmath12 fixed points lying on the sites of a two - dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "each lattice site is occupied by a magnetic atom characterized by the spin variable @xmath15 , with @xmath16 taking on the values @xmath17 .",
    "one can also consider a modified version of this model wherein some of the lattice sites , chosen randomly , are either vacant or occupied by non - magnetic atoms , ( e.g. , al atoms @xcite ) ; both cases of randomness are treated equivalently .",
    "this version of ising model is called two - dimensional randomly site - diluted ising model ( @xmath10d rsdim ) . for this system ,",
    "the critical exponents associated with the random fixed point have been estimated for the dilution - type disorder by theoretical and numerical approaches , leading to questionable conclusions , @xcite . however , these approaches have shed light on estimates of the critical temperature and nature of the phase transition . in addition",
    ", the phase diagram is strongly influenced , among other factors , by dilution , @xcite .",
    "the concentration of vacancies ( or nonmagnetic particles ) is denoted by @xmath18 ( dilution ) , while that of occupied sites ( magnetic particles ) by @xmath19 ( purity ) , @xmath20 .",
    "the vacancies are considered to be quenched and uncorrelated , since one can also encounter systems where the vacancy locations are correlated , @xcite .",
    "the process to be followed here for tackling the rsdim is that of monte carlo . the mc approach has been proved to be a powerful tool to study difficult problems such as random spin systems . in some cases , the simulation method suffers from problems of slow dynamics , thus , new algorithms have been proposed to overcome such difficulties .",
    "landau ( wl)@xcite and entropic sampling @xcite are examples of such efforts . the critical properties concern always an infinitely bulk system , since the phase transitions appear in such a system ; however , from mc simulations the critical behavior is extracted from results obtained on a finite - size system by means of finite - size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "this process , since its inception , has been evolved as a very powerful tool for extracting properties of an infinite system near a phase transition , although it is , as yet , not fully completed causing , sometimes , ambiguities about its results",
    ". the major goal of the finite - size method is to identify the set of critical exponents that , together with other universal parameters , characterizes the universality class . as these exponents offer the most direct test of universality , their precise calculation is of great importance .",
    "however , the experimental devices are finite , consequently , the exponents can not be measured with infinite precision causing , occasionally , controversies to distinguish the universality class a specific system belongs , @xcite . for more on the theory of finite - size scaling",
    "see , e.g. , barber @xcite , privman @xcite and binder @xcite .    for the @xmath10d rsdim ,",
    "the nature of the possible phase transition as well as the universality class is not completely understood .",
    "the value and even the sign of the specific heat exponent @xmath2 is still not known .",
    "because of logarithmic divergence of specific heat of the pure system ( @xmath11 ) , harris criterion is inconclusive , hence , a great deal of effort has been dedicated to elucidating the properties of the @xmath10d rsdim .",
    "currently , it seems that two scenarios have prevailed , which , however , are mutually exclusive . according to the first one ( _ logarithmic - corrections _",
    "scenario ) , the critical exponents are unaffected by disorder , apart from possible logarithmic corrections ( _ strong - universality _ ) , while the second , predicts critical exponents varying continuously with disorder , but the exponents ratios @xmath21 , @xmath22 remain the same as in the pure case , _ weak universality _ , @xcite .",
    "kim and patrascioiu @xcite studied the @xmath10d rsdim on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and dilution - site concentration ( dilution probability ) @xmath23 and lattice linear size @xmath13 up to @xmath24 , using mc simulation ; their conclusions are that the specific heat does not diverge for @xmath25 while for @xmath26 it seems to increase as @xmath27 , @xmath28 critical temperature .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath29 and correlation length @xmath30 fit the pure power law , the value of the respective exponent @xmath31 and @xmath3 increases with @xmath18 while @xmath32 remains the same as in the pure system .",
    "queiroz and stinchcombe @xcite using transfer - matrix - scaling technique , mazzeo and khn @xcite following the same technique with the equilibrium ensemble approach to disordered systems , came to the same conclusions .",
    "newman and riedel @xcite , using renormalization group on weakly diluted systems confirmed the existence of a new stable fixed point with new exponents .",
    "heuer @xcite focused on the exponents @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the @xmath10d rsdim on a square lattice with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; according to his estimations , @xmath34 does not change notably with dilution within the errors and , practically , it assumes its pure system value .",
    "the exponent @xmath33 shows a strong dilution - dependence in the temperature range @xmath37 , but near @xmath38 it asymptotically approaches the pure system value @xmath39 independently of dilution .",
    "on the other hand , shchur and vasilyev @xcite analyzing the mc data for the magnetic susceptibility critical amplitudes @xmath40 above and below the critical temperature , respectively , for dilution @xmath41 and lattice linear size up to @xmath42 , concluded that the ratio @xmath43 seems to remain constant for the dilute - site concentrations considered and equal to its pure system value .",
    "this implies that the @xmath10d rsdim belongs to the same universality class as the pure one .",
    "dotsenko and dotsenko @xcite , shalaev @xcite , shankar @xcite , ludwig @xcite , using field theoretical calculations , showed that randomness is irrelevant ( critical exponents are unchanged ) and only logarithmic corrections might appear in the case of weak dilution ; they found for the correlation length , magnetization and susceptibility , respectively ,    @xmath44^{1/2 }           \\;\\ ; \\label{xi}\\ ] ]    @xmath45^{-1/16 }        \\;\\ ; \\label{magn}\\ ] ]    @xmath46^{7/8 }           \\;\\ ; \\label{xi}\\ ] ]    while the specific heat diverges as ln(lnl )    @xmath47 + c '    \\;\\ ; \\label{spech}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is a smooth function of q , @xmath11 and @xmath49 a constant .",
    "ballesteros et al @xcite , by performing mc simulations in conjunction with finite - size scaling ( fss ) for @xmath50 , although observed small deviations of the values of the critical exponents from those of the pure system on varying the concentration , they considered it as a transient effect , since this can be lifted if a pure ising value for the exponents is combined with logarithmic corrections .",
    "selke et al @xcite , using mc techniques for lattices with linear size @xmath51 and spin concentration @xmath52 , concluded that impurities lead the specific heat to diverge as @xmath53 ln(lnl ) on approaching the critical temperature .",
    "tomita and okabe @xcite performed mc simulations on the same system on a square lattice using the probability - changing cluster ( pcc ) algorithm confirming that randomness is irrelevant and its influence is evident through logarithmic corrections .",
    "allowing for the previous arguments , we remark that in spite of much effort devoted to the investigation of rsdim in the critical region , the question of the dependence of critical exponents on randomness is still open . in this paper",
    ", we shall examine the critical properties of the @xmath10d rsdim using an alternative approach based on the wl algorithm . in this analysis",
    ", the major goal will be to estimate the critical temperature and exponents of the @xmath10d rsdim for various values of the spin concentrations to assess whether it belongs to the ising universality class or not by studying the finite - size behavior of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after the introduction of the model , we shall discuss the approach based on the wl algorithm and an efficient implementation by conveniently restricting the simulation in the dominant energy subspace . in section",
    "@xmath54 we apply the fss to the ising model under consideration and we close with the conclusions and discussions in section @xmath55 .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of the two - dimensional site - diluted ising model , in the absence of any external field ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the interaction constant , ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 , called occupation variables , are quenched , uncorrelated random variables chosen to be equal to @xmath59 with probability @xmath19 , when the @xmath60-site is occupied by a magnetic atom and @xmath61 with probability @xmath62 otherwise ; that is , we have the probability distribution @xmath63 .",
    "the summation extends over all nearest - neighbor pairs of the square lattice , of linear size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the data was generated by extensive mc calculations using wl sampling method to estimate the density of states ( dos ) @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "wl sampling performs a random walk with an acceptance ratio @xmath65\\}}$ ] , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the energies before and after the transition , respectively , aiming at sampling a flat histogram in energy .",
    "the wl algorithm overcomes the difficulties , such as critical slowing down and long relaxation times in systems with complex energy landscape , appearing in other mc processes .",
    "this algorithm has been applied to a wide range of systems spanning from the ising model @xcite , random field ising model @xcite , @xmath54d conserved - order - parameter ising model @xcite , potts @xcite , to glassy systems @xcite , polymers @xcite , dna @xcite and the baxter - wu model @xcite .",
    "the dos @xmath64 is not constant during the random walk , it is modified according to the rule @xmath68 ; the modification factor @xmath69 varies as @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the order of iteration . in the current investigation ,",
    "the wl algorithm performed @xmath72 iterations and the initial value for @xmath69 was @xmath73 .    having an accurate estimation of @xmath64 ,",
    "the non - normalized canonical distribution can be constructed , @xmath74 ; subsequently , the partition function can be calculated through the expression @xmath75 , from which most of the thermodynamic observables can be estimated .",
    "this kind of mc simulation constitutes a major improvement towards speeding calculations since it avoids multiple runs ( one for each temperature ) needed by the majority of mc algorithms to describe the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities over a significant temperature range ; in a wl algorithm temperature is not needed to be specified a priori . in the present case ,",
    "the wl algorithm was implemented on lattices with @xmath76 and the density of states was stored as a function of the energy .",
    "the dilution @xmath18 can vary from @xmath77 @xmath78 to the percolation threshold @xmath79 @xmath80 , @xcite .",
    "the quantities , upon which we shall rely for studying the critical behavior of the rsdim , are the specific heat @xmath81-[<e>]^{2})/(nt^{2})\\right)$ ] and magnetic susceptibility @xmath82-[<m>]^{2})/(nt)\\right)$ ] , per particle .",
    "the mc data is generated by choosing a realization of the dilution for a specific value of @xmath18 and various values of @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure is then repeated for several other realizations for a specific value for the lattice linear size @xmath13 . for each realization",
    ", we find the maximum value of the specific heat @xmath83 and susceptibility @xmath84 ) , recording simultaneously the values of the respective pseudocritical temperatures , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , forming in each case , a sequence of  pseudocritical temperatures \" converging to the critical temperature @xmath87 of the infinite system as @xmath88 . among the different realizations large fluctuations are observed in the same set of the previous quantities .",
    "the presence of randomness is evident in the way averaging processes are carried out for an observable @xmath89 , which assumes a different value for each of the @xmath90 random realizations of the disorder corresponding to the same value of dilution q. this implies that @xmath89 behaves as a stochastic variable , whose mean value is estimated through a two - step process .",
    "first , the usual thermal average is performed for a specific realization of the dilution .",
    "after the completion of the m realizations of randomness , the disorder average is carried out over the m realizations and is denoted by the brackets [ ] .    for the @xmath91",
    "i m the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility in the thermodynamic limit diverge ; in a finite lattice , this divergence is rounded off and manifests itself by a maximum exhibited by the above quantities .",
    "this maximum increases gradually with @xmath13 and ultimately tends to infinity as @xmath92 . for the @xmath10d rsdim , in attempting to detect the maximum @xmath93 of the specific heat and the respective temperature @xmath94 ( pseudocritical temperature ) , we considered two routes .",
    "let @xmath95 be the specific heat for a particular realization @xmath96 out of @xmath90 realizations for a specific dilution @xmath18 .",
    "in the first route , we estimated , initially , the maximum value @xmath97 together with the respective pseudocritical temperature @xmath98 for every realization @xmath96 of the disorder ; then , we considered the _ sample average _ of the individual specific heat maximum @xmath99 $ ] and pseudocritical temperature @xmath100 $ ] , for the @xmath90 realizations ,    @xmath101 = \\frac{1}{m }   \\sum_{m=1}^{m}c^{*}_{m}(q , l),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;    [ t^{*}_{c}(q , l ) ] = \\frac{1}{m } \\sum_{m=1}^{m}t^{*}_{c , m}(q , l ) \\;\\ ; \\label{specheat1}\\ ] ]    in the second route , following rieger and young , the _ sample summation _ for the specific heat for the totality of @xmath90 realizations was considered @xcite ,    @xmath102_{sum } = \\frac{1}{m }   \\sum_{m=1}^{m}c_{m}(q , l )   \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\;\\ ; \\label{specheat2}\\ ] ]    in ( [ specheat2 ] ) , the resulting specific heat curve is very complex with many local maxima , reflecting the strong pseudocritical temperature fluctuations in the ensemble of random realizations . from these maxima",

    "an important issue arising in a disordered system is the notion of self - averaging , that is , to what extent properties of the system depend on the particular realization of the quenched random variables , implying that the distribution of an observable becomes sharper as @xmath13 increases . in case",

    "the respective distributions transform into delta functions as @xmath195 . to investigate the possibility of such a behavior in the current disordered model , we produce @xmath196 samples of an observable @xmath89 ( e.g. , specific heat , susceptibility ) and form the respective probability density distribution @xmath197 , where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are the value of the observable in the @xmath71-bin and its global average , respectively . if we identify @xmath89 with system s susceptibility @xmath29 , then the resulting probability density @xmath200 as a function of @xmath201 for @xmath202 and @xmath203 appears in fig .",
    "the respective curves of the relative susceptibility for a specific value of dilution collapse on each other irrespective of the value for @xmath13 and they do not become sharper on increasing @xmath13 . the general shape of the curves remains the same independently of the value for @xmath18 .",

    "a consequence of the invariance of ( @xmath207 ) is that the exponent @xmath208 is invariant , as well .",
    "using the rushbrooke equality @xmath209 in conjunction with hyperscaling relation @xmath158 , we deduced that ( @xmath210 ) is also invariant , retaining its pure ising value , @xmath211 . referring to the critical temperature , although there exist four different sequences , resulting from the various procedures for any dilution @xmath18 , each one exhibits a decreasing tendency , tending to zero as @xmath18 tends to the percolation limit @xmath169 .",
    "a notable feature of the current - model data is the asymptotic behavior of the specific heat as @xmath13 increases ; it tends to a saturation value for any @xmath18 , in contradistinction to its counterpart in the pure model that diverges .",
    "the other critical quantity , susceptibility , still diverges as @xmath88 .",
    "an important issue is that if impurity concentrations larger than @xmath139 towards the percolation limit @xmath212 are considered , then the high dilution shall reduce significantly the long - range correlations enhancing in this way the finite - size effects ; to moderate this effect larger lattices are needed at the cost of larger computer - execution time .",
