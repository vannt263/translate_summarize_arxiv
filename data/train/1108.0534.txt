    "investigations of plasma instabilities and plasma waves , both in astrophysics and in the laboratory , frequently start with a consideration of equilibrium solutions . for collisionless plasmas , the required equilibria are found by solving the steady - state vlasov - maxwell equations .",

    "+ force - free magnetic fields , which satisfy @xmath0 , such that the current density and magnetic field are parallel to each other , can be used to model magnetic fields in low - beta plasmas , such as that of the solar corona .",

    ". an obvious consequence of this result is that two distribution functions giving rise to the same pressure function will automatically satisfy the vlasov - maxwell equations for the same magnetic field profile . + in the present paper , it is shown how this property can be used to calculate a new family of distribution functions for the force - free harris sheet .",
    "this family includes the previously known distribution function @xcite , as well as more general distribution functions with a different dependence on the particle energy , but with the same dependence on the canonical momenta .",
    "a direct comparison can be made between the pressure function calculated from the more general distribution functions and the pressure function calculated from the known distribution function in order to give conditions on the parameters which , when satisfied , will mean that the general distribution functions are also valid solutions for the force - free harris sheet .",
