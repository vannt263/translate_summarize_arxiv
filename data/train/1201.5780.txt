    "the balanced case , @xmath28 , is easier to describe  and that is now our focus .",
    "we give some results for the general case in an appendix .    * a different construction of stopping sets : * suppose that a stationary poisson process of intensity @xmath0 exists in the plane , with seeds marked either @xmath4 ( east growing ) or @xmath3 ( south growing ) with equal probability . in section [ djbsim ] we have described how a nest of zuyev s stopping sets is created when the growth frontier of an expanding domain hits the seeds .",
    "for the cowan  ma model , the seeds that are relevant for an east  growing test ray commencing at @xmath13 in figure [ cmtri](a ) is the shaded region in that figure  or , more precisely , the _ unbounded _ octant lying between @xmath89 and @xmath190 , with @xmath191 : we call this region , the initial _ live zone_.    as before we start by expanding a domain  an isosceles right angle triangle in this case ( see figure [ trapss ] )  into the live zone , stopping when it hits the first seed @xmath111 whose coordinates relative to @xmath13 are @xmath192 .",
    "this creates a domain @xmath94 with area @xmath95 that is exponentially distributed .",
    "if @xmath111 is @xmath3type , then it will provide the ray that blocks the test seed ; thus @xmath193 and no other seeds need be considered .    alternatively if @xmath111 is @xmath4type , then , instead of growing @xmath94 ( retaining its shape as an isosceles right  angle triangle and constructing the familiar zuyev _",
    "nest _ of stopping sets ) , we introduce a significant modification .",
    "we remove a part of the live zone : a ` dead zone ' labelled @xmath194 ( see figure [ trapss ] ) which has now become irrelevant , as we shall soon see .    as @xmath195 has been constructed without drawing upon any information taken from outside @xmath195 , the point process in the remaining region ( the new _ live zone _ ) is still a poisson process with unchanged intensity given the information within @xmath196  as explained in section [ djbsim ] .",
    "we now grow a trapezium whose left ",
    "hand side located at @xmath197 has length @xmath198 .",
    "the trapezium expands until its right  hand side first hits a seed @xmath122 ( in the new live zone ) .",
    "the stopping set formed is called @xmath110 .",
    "it has an exponentially distributed area @xmath109 .",
    "trapezoidal stopping sets and dead zones in the half model .",
    ", width=8 ]    we proceed in this way , forming a sequence of stopping sets ( illustrated in figure [ trapss ] ) which , unlike those in section [ djbsim ] , do not form a nest .",
    "they do , however , have independent exponentially  distributed areas and are part of a recursive structure which we can exploit . it is also important to note that the first @xmath3type seed will provide the ray which blocks the test ray . without our introduction of dead zones ,",
    "a complicated algorithm rather like ` block ` would be required to check if a @xmath3type ray actually reaches the path of the test ray .",
    "remark 2 : _ why is it that no seed in @xmath194 can influence the distance @xmath12 travelled by the test seed ; dead zone @xmath3types will either be blocked by an east  growing ray within the live zone or , if they are not blocked , the test ray must have been intersected at an earlier point .",
    "dead zone @xmath4types can never be in a geometrical position to block live zone @xmath3types .",
    "the same line of reasoning applies to dead zones @xmath199 . _",
    "remark 3 : _ in section 3 we mentioned that extraneous randomisations , those not solely dependent on the poisson point process , might invalidate the key results from the stopping  set theory .",
    "there is no such problem here with the stopping set @xmath93 itself , but we note that @xmath200 depends for its existence on an extraneous random feature  namely the @xmath4 or @xmath3 mark of seed @xmath201 .",
    "this does not invalidate our comment above that the point process in the current live zone outside @xmath202 is unaffected by the information in @xmath202 .",
    "for one thing the seed marks are independent of each other and of the point process .",
    "furthermore , we only stop constructing dead zones when we have no further need to observe the process at all .",
    "so the extraneous random feature is not operative in our analysis . _    * the recursive structure commencing with a generic live zone : * suppose that we begin observing the process when the live zone has left boundary of height @xmath53 and when we are about to construct @xmath203 . in figure [ trapss ]",
    ", we draw the case @xmath204 .",
    "the probability density function for the length , @xmath205 , of @xmath203 s base , conditional on the height @xmath53 of its left boundary , follows from the exponential distribution of @xmath203 s area @xmath206 .",
    "it is therefore : @xmath207 if the stopping seed @xmath208 for set @xmath203 is @xmath3type , then its south ray will be the first to intersect the test ray and the process ends . otherwise , another dead zone is created and further trapezoidal stopping sets are formed until a @xmath3type is met .",
    "let @xmath209 be the random variable equal to the horizontal distance covered by stopping sets until the process comes to an end .",
    "the density function of @xmath209 , conditional on @xmath53 will be : @xmath210,\\ ] ] where @xmath211 if @xmath212 .",
    "the first term in the square brackets accounts for the case where the first seed is v  type , and the second term for the case where it is h  type and the process is effectively re  started with a different boundary condition having already covered some horizontal distance .",
    "we have taken @xmath213 , but the analysis can be carried out for general @xmath18 , producing a more complicated result .",
    "note that the ray length probability density function is @xmath214 .",
    "we define the moments of the conditional density : @xmath215 as mentioned before we will here compute @xmath216 and @xmath217 , which from equation ( [ condensity ] ) , satisfy : @xmath218 \\\\ \\label{mu2 } \\mu_2(0 ) & = \\frac{2}{\\lambda } + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\lambda}}\\int_0^\\infty \\textrm{erfc}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}}u\\right)\\mu_2(u ) du + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\frac{\\lambda}{2}u^2}\\mu_1(u)du.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our strategy is to find @xmath219 and @xmath220 up to an arbitrary constant , and then to determine the constant using equations ( [ mu1 ] ) and ( [ mu2 ] ) .",

    "* the first conditional moment : * making the change of variable @xmath226 in equation ( [ mu1diff ] ) we obtain : @xmath227 if the coefficient of @xmath228 were a positive multiple of two , this would be hermite s equation , solved by hermite polynomials . since this is not the case , we seek a series solution @xcite : @xmath229 and obtain the recurrence relation : @xmath230 this leads to the general solution : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is kummer s function @xcite : @xmath233 here we have used the pochhammer symbol , defined by : @xmath234 the kummer s functions diverge as @xmath235 , but we know that @xmath236 in that limit .",

    "the general solution is : @xmath238 it must be the case that @xmath239 in order to capture the right asymptotic behavior so , restoring the original variable @xmath53 , the conditional moment must have the form : @xmath240 it now remains to compute @xmath80 .",
