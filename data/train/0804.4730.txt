    "cosmic - rays ( crs ) below the knee region ( @xmath5 ev ) are generally considered to be of galactic origin .",
    "though the nature of their sources are not exactly known , it is widely beleived that majority of them are accelerated in supernova remnant ( snr ) shock waves . such a hypothesis",
    "is mainly based on the similarity of the power supplied by a supernova explosion to the power required to maintain the cr energy density in the galaxy ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "in addition , studies using nonlinear effects produced by accelerated crs have shown that the maximum energy of crs that can be accelerated in snrs is @xmath8 ev ( where @xmath9 is the total charge of the particle ) which is close to the knee ( berezhko 1996 ) .",
    "it is quite expected that the presence of one or more nearby discrete sources can result in various significant effects on the observed properties of crs .",
    "studies concerning their contributions to the total cr electron flux can be found in earlier studies like mao @xmath10 shen ( 1972 ) and cowsik @xmath10 lee ( 1979 ) under the framework of an energy independent cr diffusive propagation model and later , in atoyan et al .",
    "1995 and kobayashi et al .",
    "2004 assuming a more realistic energy dependent diffusion cofficients in the galaxy",
    ". for cr nuclei , lingenfelter ( 1969 ) studied the density variations at the earth due to the local sources using a simple particle escape model and later , erlykin @xmath10 wolfendale ( 2001 ) carried out monte carlo calculations assuming snrs to be distributed stochastically throughout the nearby galaxy .",
    "strong @xmath10 moskalenko ( 2001 ) studied the influence of the discrete nature of snrs on the cr proton densities in the galaxy using their galprop cr propagation code .",
    "in addition , some recent studies tried to stretch the importance of local sources to explain some strongly observed features of crs like the knee and the anisotropy .",
    "for instance , erlykin @xmath10 wolfendale ( 2000 ) claimed that the knee in the cr spectrum can be attributed to the presence of a single recent supernova ( as yet unidentified ) in the local region .",
    "erlykin @xmath10 wolfendale ( 2006 ) further tried to explain the rise in the anisotropy amplitude as well as the change in its phase near the knee using a single source exploded in the direction from the sun downward of the main cr flux , which comes predominantly from the inner galaxy .",
    "moreover , using a convection - diffusion cr propagation model , thoudam ( 2006 ) tried to emphasise the necessity for the presence of at least one old nearby source in order to explain the observed proton flux below @xmath0 gev / n . in another recent study , thoudam ( 2007a ) studied the effect of the nearby known snrs on the observed cr anisotropy below the knee and later on , suggested the possibility of explaining the data above @xmath11 gev / n by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters and claimed that the source may be an _ undetected _ old snr with a characteristic age of @xmath12 yr located at a distance of @xmath13 kpc from the earth ( thoudam 2007b ) .",
    "taillet @xmath10 maurin ( 2003 ) pointed out that the majority of the crs reaching the earth are possibly emitted by sources located within a few kpc and hence , the propagation parameters that we usually derived from the observed secondary@xmath14primary ( s@xmath14p ) may only give a local information which may be different from other parts of the galaxy . in another work , b@xmath15sching et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that even if the cr propagation parameters are assumed to be constant throughout the galaxy , the discrete nature of the cr sources can produce a much larger fluctuations of the cr primary densities than that of the secondaries , implying a significant fluctuations in the s@xmath14p ratio . in this paper , we shall also study about the expected fluctuations on the cr primary and secondary spectra at the earth , but by incorporating the nearby known cr sources ( considered here as snrs ) .",
    "such an approach is expected to give a more detailed understanding about the cr density fluctuations and its implications as far as the position of the earth is concerned .",
    "we plan the paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief description about our model . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the cr primary and secondary spectra from a discrete point - like source and in section 4 , we calculate for the crs from a continuous and stationary source distribution . in section 5 , we study the cr density variations at the earth due to a single nearby source and in section 6 , we give an application to the nearby snrs and present a comparison of the calculated cr spectra with the observed data .",
    "finally in section 7 , we give a brief discussion about our results and its implications .",
    "our model assumes that a major fraction of the crs detected at the earth are liberated from sources which are distributed uniformly and continuously ( both in space and time ) in the galaxy .",
    "we refer to these sources as the background sources and the crs they emit as the background crs .",
    "in addition , we also assume that there exists some nearby discrete sources which inject crs in a discrete space - time model and whose contributions to the total crs are yet to be investigated .",
    "the contributions of the discrete and the background sources will be treated seperately .",
    "crs from the discrete sources will be discussed under the framework of a time dependent diffusive propagation model while those from the background sources in a steady state model .    for the background crs ,",
    "the flattened shape of our galaxy allows us to assume their diffusion region as a cylindrical disk of infinite radius with finite half - thickness @xmath16 .",
    "such an assumption of infinite radius is valid at least for cr studies at the position of the earth , which is at a distance of @xmath17 kpc from the galactic centre , where the effect of the galactic radial boundary ( assumed to be @xmath18 kpc ) on the cr flux is expected to be negligible .",
    "this is because a substantial fraction of the crs reaching the earth are liberated from sources located within an approximate distance which is of the order of @xmath16 ( see e.g. taillet @xmath10 maurin 2003 ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath16 is not exactly known .",
    "the values estimated using different cr propagation models fall in the wide range of @xmath19 kpc ( see e.g. , lukasiak et al .",
    "1994 , webber @xmath10 soutoul 1998 , strong @xmath10 moskalenko 1998 ) . for our calculations ,",
    "we choose a value of @xmath20 kpc .",
    "we further assume that the background sources as well as the interstellar matter are distributed in a thin disk of radius @xmath21 and half - thickness @xmath22 . here again , the effect of @xmath21 on the cr flux is negligible as long as @xmath23 .",
    "observations have found that both the distributions of the snrs as well as those of the atomic and molecular hydrogen extend approximately upto a radial distance of @xmath24 kpc ( case @xmath10 bhattcharya 1996 , gordon @xmath10 burton 1976 ) .",
    "regarding the vertical distributions , detailed studies have found that most of the snrs and the molecular hydrogen are confined within the region @xmath25 pc from the galactic plane ( see e.g stupar et al .",
    "2007 , bronfman et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the distribution of atomic hydrogen also follow a similar structure but with a thin long tail extending as far as @xmath26 pc from the plane ( dickey @xmath10 lockman 1990 ) . therefore ,",
    "in our calculations we consider an infinitely thin disk approximation for both the background sources and the matter distributions .",
    "such an approximation can also be found in some earlier works like webber et al .",
    "1992 , seo @xmath10 ptuskin 1994 etc .",
    "for the nearby discrete sources , we consider only known snrs located within a distance of @xmath27 kpc from the earth .",
    "they are listed in table 1 along with their estimated distances and ages .",
    "they are the sources which are expected to produce significant temporal fluctuations in the cr densities at the earth ( thoudam 2006 ) .",
    "the diffusion region for crs from these sources is assumed to be of infinite dimensions .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that crs from nearby sources do not effectively see the presence of any galactic boundaries ( both in the radial as well as vertical directions ) due to their much smaller propagation times to the earth compared to their escape timescales from the galaxy boundaries ( thoudam 2007b ) .",
    "one more assumption that we make in our model is that since the earth is reported to be only @xmath28 pc away from the galactic median plane ( cohen 1995 ) , we will simply consider that the earth is located on the median plane itself in all our calculations .",

    "we adopt a particle release time of @xmath46 for the discrete sources .",
    "the source spectral index is taken as @xmath47 and the value of the source normalization constant @xmath48 is chosen such that the resulting total @xmath29c spectrum is normalized to the observed spectrum at @xmath49 gev / n for the supernova explosion rate of @xmath50 myr@xmath7 kpc@xmath51 in the galaxy .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 ( left ) .",
    "the @xmath30o spectra calculated using the source abundance ratio of o / c @xmath52 is shown in figure 3 ( right ) .",

    "the experimental data in figure 3 are taken from the compilation of different experiments given in zei et al .",
    "the secondary boron spectrum , calculated using the @xmath29c and @xmath30o primary spectra shown in figure 3 , is found to explain the observed boron data quite well .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 where the experimental data are taken from swordy et al .",
    "1990 and engelmann et al . 1990 .    for the primaries",
    ", one can notice from figure @xmath54 that the inclusion of the nearby snrs in the study produces noticeable deviations from the background flux for energies above @xmath0 gev / n . for instance , the deviation in the case of @xmath29c reaches a value of @xmath1 at energies around @xmath2 gev / n .",
    "but , from figure @xmath55 we can see that the deviation in the case of @xmath39b which is considered here as a purely secondary particle is almost negligible .",
    "the results for the secondaries obtained in this paper agree quite well with the earlier findings of b@xmath15sching et al .",
    "2005 , but some major differences can be seen in the case of the primaries .",
    "they found a typical primary amplitude variations of @xmath56 at almost all the energies whereas we find almost no variations upto @xmath0 gev / n and beyond that we see a slow increase reaching a value of @xmath1 at @xmath3 gev / n .",
    "this can be clearly understood if one examines figure @xmath57 in detail where we have plotted the individual components of the overall @xmath29c spectrum previously shown in figure @xmath54 ( left ) .",
    "the contributions from the individual snrs are labelled as @xmath58 ( see the figure caption for details ) .",
    "it can be seen that among the snrs , only the monogem and the geminga give the highest contribution below @xmath0 gev / n while the rest of the snrs contribute mostly above @xmath59 gev / n .",
    "since the cr flux from a point source depends strongly on the age and distance of the source , the low energy crs from the nearby snrs have not yet reached us effectively except those coming from the monogem and geminga snrs .",
    "but still , the maximum contributions of monogem and geminga below @xmath0 gev / n are found to be approximately two orders of magnitude less than the overall flux . above @xmath59 gev",
    "/ n , the major contributors are vela , g@xmath60-@xmath61 and sn@xmath62 , each one of them contributing around @xmath63 of the total flux at different energy regions . adding the contributions of the other snrs",
    "also , the total contribution from the nearby known snrs comes to @xmath64 of the overall cr flux which corresponds to @xmath1 deviation from the background level at energies @xmath65 gev / n .     expected b / c ratios at the earth in the presence of the nearby snrs listed in table 1 , calculated for different particle injection times @xmath66 yr as indicated in the key box .",

    "this is shown in figure @xmath70 where we have plotted the ratios ( @xmath71 ) expected in the presence of the nearby snrs . for reference ,",
    "we have also plotted the ratio expected purely from the cr background ( solid line ) . the experimental data are taken from swordy et al .",
    "1990 , panov et al .",
    "2007 and the compilations of different experiments given in stephens @xmath10 streitmatter 1998 . strictly speaking",
    ", it is not the age @xmath72 alone which determines the contribution of a discrete source but the propagation time @xmath73 of the particles after they are released from the source .",
    "but , the value of @xmath74 is not exactly known .",
    "it may be even different for different sources though we assume the same value for all the sources in the present work .",
    "so , in figure @xmath70 we have considered various particle release times i.e. @xmath75 @xmath10 @xmath76 yr . below @xmath0 gev , it can be seen that at all the @xmath77s the ratios show almost zero deviations from the background ratio . any deviation ,",
    "if exists , are seen at energies @xmath59 gev . at @xmath78 yr , we see deviations of magnitude @xmath79 in the energy range of @xmath80 gev / n . at @xmath81 yr",
    ", the ratio shows the maximum deviation reaching a value of @xmath82 at @xmath83 gev / n and for @xmath84 yr , say at @xmath85 yr , the effect of the nearby snrs becomes negligible producing almost zero deviation from the background ratio .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that detailed studies based on the diffusive shock acceleration in snrs suggest that the highest energy particles start leaving the source region already at the beginning of the sedov phase ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the major fraction of the accelerated crs remain confined for almost around @xmath2 yr for a typical interstellar hydrogen atom density of @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "we will come to this point later again in the next section while discussing about the implications of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "just for the sake of completeness , we have plotted the @xmath29c spectrum for @xmath68 yr in figure 7 . here , except geminga ( being an old snr with age @xmath69 yr ) , all the other nearby snrs have not yet released crs into the local ism , thereby , leading to a negligible effect at the earth .",
    "we have studied the effect of the presence of nearby snrs on the cr primary and secondary spectra at the earth .",
    "we see strong variations in the primary spectra and almost no variation in the case of the secondaries .",
    "the results for the primaries obtained here are quite different from those obtained from the simulation studies given in erlykin @xmath10 wolfendale ( 2001 ) and b@xmath15sching et al .",
    "we see variations mostly above @xmath0 gev / n whereas they showed significant fluctuations at all the energies .",
    "in fact , their results represent the density fluctuations that one can expect at any arbitrary location in the galaxy due to the random nature of supernova explosions both in space as well as time .",
    "but , as far as the position of the earth is concerned , the actual variations can be determined only when one incorporates the nearby sources in the study .",
    "we , therefore , include the nearby known snrs in our analysis and found that the primary variations obtained at the earth show considerable differences from those predicted using the monte - carlo simulations .    below @xmath0 gev",
    "/ n , we have found that the effect of the nearby snrs on the b / c ratio is negligible ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "this implies that we can safely rely on the observed ratio to determine the cr diffusion coefficient in the galaxy particularly below @xmath0 gev / n . above this energy",
    "the observed data will not give a reliable information about the propagation parameter because of the significant contaminations of the background crs by those coming from the nearby snrs .",
    "one should note that the primary crs observed at the earth are liberated from sources located within a short distance which is of the order of the vertical halo height @xmath16 ( taillet @xmath10 maurin 2003 ) .",
    "this can also be understood from fig .",
    "8 where we have plotted the fraction of @xmath29c primaries at the earth originated within a radial distance @xmath88 for energies @xmath89 gev / n",
    ". the calculations are performed for @xmath90 kpc .",
    "we can see from the figure that for energies less than @xmath11 gev / n , @xmath31 ( @xmath91 ) of the total crs are emitted within a distance of @xmath92 kpc ( @xmath57 kpc ) .",
    "this shows that even though the b / c ratio below @xmath0 gev / n can give reliable informations about the diffusion coefficient , the small galactic region scanned by the crs reaching the earth allows them to carry information only for a small fraction of the whole galaxy ( see also taillet @xmath10 maurin 2003 ) .",
    "we have also studied the effect of different particle release times ( @xmath93 yr ) from the snrs on the b / c ratio . at @xmath78 yr , we have found a deviation of @xmath79 from the background ratio for energies @xmath80 gev / n and at @xmath81 yr we see the maximum deviation reaching a value of @xmath82 at around @xmath94 gev / n . for @xmath84",
    "yr , say at @xmath85 yr , the effect of the nearby snrs becomes almost negligible , thereby , making the observed b / c data a reliable quantity for determining the cr propagation parameters at all energies .",
    "this conclusion is , in fact , supported by the predictions of the diffusive shock acceleration theories in snrs which show that a major fraction of the accelerated crs remain confined in snrs for almost around @xmath2 yr ( berezhko et al .",
    "for such a confinement time , we see that except geminga all the other local snrs listed in table 1 look quite young and might not have liberated cr particles in the local ism .",
    "this can be understood from figure 7 where we have plotted the @xmath29c spectra for @xmath68 yr .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that if one accepts the theoretical view of crs confinement in snrs for upto @xmath3 yr , the effect of the nearby snrs on the observed crs is expected to be quite negligible .",
    "then , one can expect the observed s / p ratio to give a good estimation of the cr diffusion coefficient at all energies , but only for the small galactic region traversed by them before reaching the earth .",

    "<S> the presence of nearby discrete cosmic - ray ( cr ) sources can lead to many interesting effects on the observed properties of crs . in this paper , we study about the possible effects on the cr primary and secondary spectra and also the subsequent effects on the cr secondary - to - primary ratios . for the study , we assume that crs undergo diffusive propagation in the galaxy and we neglect the effect of convection , energy losses and reacceleration . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that there exists a uniform and continuous distribution of cr sources in the galaxy generating a stationary cr background at the earth . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also consider the existence of some nearby sources which inject crs in a discrete space - time model . assuming a constant cr source power throughout the galaxy </S>",
    "<S> , our study has found that the presence of nearby supernova remnants ( snrs ) produces noticeable variations in the primary fluxes mainly above @xmath0 gev / n , if crs are assumed to be released instantaneously after the supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the variation reaches a value of @xmath1 at around @xmath2 gev / n . </S>",
    "<S> respect to earlier studies , the variation in the case of the secondaries is found to be almost negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss about the possible effects of the different particle release times from the snrs . for the particle release time of @xmath3 yr , predicted by the diffusive shock acceleration theories in snrs </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the presence of the nearby snrs hardly produces any significant effects on the crs at the earth .    </S>",
