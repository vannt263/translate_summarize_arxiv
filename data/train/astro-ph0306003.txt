    "detailed characterization of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation will be one of the main frontiers in cosmology in the coming years . the first detection of cmb polarization @xcite and the first measurement of the large - angle correlation between polarization and temperature @xcite have already taken place , and numerous experiments in the present and near future @xcite will surely provide a wealth of polarization data .",
    "a cmb polarization map consists of maps of the stokes parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .. ] the stokes parameters are of course coordinate - dependent objects : @xmath4 is a spin-2 field .",
    "a key insight in cmb polarization theory is that the most natural way to express such a spin-2 field is to decompose it into scalar and pseudoscalar pieces , generally called @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition is crucial in analyzing polarization data .",
    "in particular , scalar perturbations ( such as density variations ) produce only @xmath0-type polarization ( in linear theory ) , so detection of a @xmath1 component could provide evidence for vector or tensor perturbations .",
    "the search for the @xmath1 component is therefore likely to be of enormous importance : this component is capable of telling us about tensor ( gravity - wave ) perturbations produced during inflation @xcite , probing the inflationary epoch far more directly than any other observations .    in standard models ,",
    "the @xmath1 component is considerably weaker than the @xmath0 component , and so is likely to be difficult to detect @xcite . to make matters worse ,",
    "the @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition is unique only for a full - sky map .",
    "this means that in the absence of complete sky coverage , unless one is very careful , @xmath0/@xmath1 confusion can reduce the detectability of the @xmath1 component @xcite .    one way to quantify",
    "the problem of @xmath0/@xmath1 leakage is to observe that the space of all possible polarization maps over any given region of sky can be decomposed into three orthogonal subspaces : a `` pure @xmath0 '' subspace , in which all power is guaranteed to come from @xmath0 modes , a `` pure @xmath1 '' subspace , in which all power is guaranteed to come from @xmath1 modes , and an `` ambiguous '' subspace , in which there is no way to tell whether the power came form @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "this decomposition was worked out in spherical harmonic space for a spherical cap in @xcite , and the general formalism is described in @xcite . in the latter work , explicit recipes are given for finding orthonormal bases ( `` normal modes '' ) for all three subspaces as eigenfunctions of the bilaplacian operator on the observed region .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a pixelized map , we give an efficient way of finding approximately pure and ambiguous modes by solving a discrete eigenvalue problem .",
    "an understanding of the @xmath0/@xmath1/ambiguous ( hereinafter e / b / a ) decomposition is likely to be of great importance in designing future experiments .",
    "for instance , the presence of ambiguous modes significantly increases the optimal sky coverage for a degree - scale @xmath1-detection experiment @xcite .",
    "we begin by summarizing some fundamental properties of @xmath0- and @xmath1-type polarization maps . for further details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "suppose for the moment that we have a polarization map that covers a small enough patch of sky to allow the use of the flat - sky approximation . in this case , it is natural to work in fourier space , where the separation into @xmath0 and @xmath1 is quite simple .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fourier ] , a fourier mode is an @xmath0 mode if the polarization direction is parallel / perpendicular to the wavevector and is a @xmath1 mode if the polarization direction makes a 45@xmath5 angle with the wavevector .",
    "any @xmath0 polarization map is a superposition of such @xmath0 fourier modes ; an example is the @xmath0 `` hot spot '' shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : fourier ] .",
    "( to get a @xmath1 spot , simply rotate the polarization by 45@xmath5 at each point . )",
    "realizations of @xmath0- and @xmath1-type gaussian random fields are shown in figure [ fig : randommaps ] .",
    "the fourier - space description of the @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition is very helpful in developing an intuitive understanding of the mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes in an incomplete or pixelized map . in a map that covers only part of the sky ( say of size @xmath6 )",
    ", we can achieve resolution @xmath7 in @xmath8 space .",
    "that is , our estimate of a fourier mode with wavevector @xmath9 will actually include contributions with a range of wavevectors centered on @xmath9 with a spread of @xmath7 . since wavenumbers with different directions will be mixed together , and since the direction of the wavevector is crucial to the @xmath0/@xmath1 separation , mixing is inevitable , with the worst problems occurring on the largest scales probed ( @xmath10 ) .    in a pixelized map , problems crop up on the small - scale end as well , due to aliased power .",
    "when a mode with a wavevector @xmath9 beyond the nyquist frequency is aliased to a lower frequency , it typically is mapped into a mode whose wavevector points in a completely different direction . as a result , aliased power has nearly complete @xmath0/@xmath1 mixing .",
    "for this reason , avoiding aliasing ( by oversampling the beam ) is even more important in polarization experiments than in temperature experiments .    2.5 in 2.5 in    in real space , the two types of polarization maps satisfy differential equations on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "any @xmath0 map must satisfy @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the polarization map , and the differential operator @xmath13 is @xmath14 note that the operator @xmath13 acts on a scalar function to produce a two - component polarization `` vector '' @xmath15 , while the conjugate operator @xmath16 turns a polarization vector into a scalar .",
    "similarly , any @xmath1 map must satisfy @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the easiest way to see that these equations are true is to verify that they work for arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 fourier modes .    in building intuition about @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ,",
    "it is extremely helpful to bear in mind the analogy with vector fields : an @xmath0 mode is the spin-2 analogue of a curl - free vector field , and a @xmath1 mode is the analogue of a divergence - free vector field .",
    "this means that the operators @xmath13 and @xmath19 are like the curl and divergence respectively .",
    "this analogy immediately suggests a conjecture .",
    "any curl - free ( divergence - free ) vector field can be written as the gradient ( curl ) of a potential .",
    "perhaps a corresponding rule works for spin-2 fields .",
    "this conjecture turns out to be correct : any @xmath0 map can be written as @xmath20 for some scalar `` potential '' @xmath21 .",
    "similarly for @xmath1 maps : @xmath22 .",
    "the reason all of this works is that @xmath23 , the analogues of the familiar vector identities @xmath24 .",
    "we note for future reference the other useful identity @xmath25 the bilaplacian .. ] for vector fields instead of spin-2 fields , the laplacian shows up on the right instead of the bilaplacian : @xmath26 . equation .",
    "the extra term is not present , however , in the case of interest here , where the operator is being applied to a ( pseudo)scalar function in two dimensions . ]",
    "2.5 in    incidentally , just as in the case of vector fields , potentials are guaranteed to exist only when the functions are defined over a simply - connected region .",
    "if the observed patch of sky has `` holes '' in it , then there are @xmath0 modes that can not be derived from a potential .",
    "figure [ fig : hole ] shows an example . despite its strikingly @xmath1-like appearance , this is in fact an @xmath0 mode ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath13 applied to it gives zero ) , although it can not be expressed as @xmath19 applied to a scalar potential . in polar coordinates .",
    "this is curl - free over any region not containing the origin , but if the region completely surrounds the origin it can not be expressed as the gradient of a potential . ]",
    "the e / b / a decomposition described in @xcite still works on such regions : modes like this one show up automatically as ambiguous modes .",
    "we begin by summarizing some key results from @xcite . any biharmonic function , _",
    "i.e. _ , any function @xmath27 such that @xmath28 generates a pair of polarization maps @xmath29 and @xmath30 that simultaneously satisfy the conditions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "we call such modes `` ambiguous . ''",
    "furthermore , all ambiguous modes can be expressed in this way .",
    "we define a _ pure _ @xmath0 mode to be one that is orthogonal to all @xmath1 modes ( including the ambiguous modes , which are after all @xmath1 modes ) .",
    "every pure @xmath0 mode can be written in the form @xmath29 , where @xmath27 satisfies both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of the observed region .",
    "( that is , both @xmath27 and the normal component of @xmath31 vanish on the boundary . )",
    "these conditions imply that the pure @xmath0 modes always have polarization parallel or perpendicular to the boundary at the edges of the map .",
    "mode to be pure . ] similarly , any pure @xmath1 mode can be written as @xmath30 .",
    "pure @xmath1 modes always hit the boundary of the map at a 45@xmath5 angle .",
    "a natural way to generate an orthonormal basis of pure @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes is to find the eigenfunctions of the bilaplacian that satisfy both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "( the bilaplacian has a complete set of such eigenfunctions . ) for the case of a disc , a sample of ambiguous , pure @xmath0 , and pure @xmath1 modes is shown in figure [ fig : modes ] .    in some cases",
    ", it may not be convenient to find a complete basis of normal modes ; it may be preferable to perform the e / b / a separation on a map directly in real space .",
    "we present here a brief sketch of some ways this can be done .",
    "first , suppose that we have a polarization map @xmath32 that covers the entire sky ( taken for simplicity to be a plane rather than a sphere ) .",
    "we can express @xmath32 as the sum of an @xmath0 piece and a @xmath1 piece : @xmath33 the potentials @xmath34 can be found by means of green functions : @xmath35 where the @xmath0 green function must satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "explicit forms for the green functions are easily found : @xmath38 in polar coordinates .",
    "these green functions give the @xmath0 and @xmath1 `` response '' to any given point in a polarization map .",
    "for instance , if a map contains a delta - function spike in @xmath2 at the center , then the @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps will be as shown in figure [ fig : green ] . in this figure and the following , because of the large range of polarization magnitudes , we use a logarithmic greyscale rather than the lengths of the lines to indicate magnitude .",
    "the polarization maps plotted in this figure are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the results of substituting @xmath41 into equation ( [ eq : green ] )",
    ".    2.5 in 2.5 in    this figure illustrates the nonlocal character of the @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition .",
    "note that the green functions for the potentials do not go to zero at large distances : to find the potentials , we need to specify @xmath32 arbitrarily far away .",
    "since the actual polarization is a second derivative of the potential , however , the response in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization maps to a delta - function impulse does decline as the inverse square of the distance .    in the case where the map covers only part of the sky ,",
    "the same approach can be used to get the pure @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the map . however , the green functions must be replaced by functions that satisfy the appropriate dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "such functions can in principle be found , but in practice this is unlikely to be an efficient way to perform the e / b / a separation .    a much more efficient way to perform the e / b / a separation is to split the task up into two steps :    1 .",
    "separate the map into @xmath0 and @xmath1 components without worrying about purity .",
    "2 .   `` purify '' each of the two maps by projecting out the ambiguous component .",
    "the first step can be done in several ways , the most efficient being to fourier transform the maps and do the separation mode by mode .",
    "( equation ( [ eq : green ] ) can also be used , but this will generally be slower . ) if the map is of an irregular shape , it can be padded out to a convenient rectangular array in any way you like before fourier transforming ; the resulting @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition will be correct .",
    "different ways of doing this padding will in general lead to different decompositions , but they will differ only in where the ambiguous modes show up .    2.5 in 2.5 in    one way to perform the second step is to find yet more green functions .",
    "suppose we have an @xmath0 polarization map that we wish to purify .",
    "we first find a potential @xmath21 that generates this map .",
    "( this is also easily done in fourier space . )",
    "we then subtract a biharmonic function from this potential so that the residual has the correct ( dirichlet and neumann ) boundary conditions .",
    "one way to do this is @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{eq : ambgreen}\\ ] ] here @xmath43 represents the observed patch of sky .",
    "we use @xmath44 to label points on the boundary @xmath45 .",
    "the two green functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are biharmonic functions ( _ i.e. _ , generators of ambiguous modes ) that satisfy delta - function boundary conditions .",
    "specifically , @xmath48 and the reverse for @xmath47 . for the case of a disc , these green functions can be calculated analytically and are shown in figure [ fig : green2 ] .",
    "the two two green functions give the corrections that must be applied to an @xmath0 polarization map to purify it of any failure to meet the correct boundary conditions at any given point .",
    "( since there are two boundary conditions , in general two corrections must be applied ) .",
    "both produce polarization maps that decrease like with increasing distance : one is inversely proportional to the distance cubed , while the other is inverse square .",
    "this confirms what has been noted elsewhere @xcite : the ambiguous modes tend to be largest near the boundary .    in practice ,",
    "equation([eq : ambgreen ] ) is unlikely to be the most efficient way to purify a map .",
    "given the potential @xmath21 for an @xmath0 map that we wish to purify , it will generally be much faster to use other numerical methods to find a biharmonic function @xmath49 whose value and first derivative match @xmath21 on the boundary .",
    "subtracting @xmath50 from the original @xmath0 map will purify it .",
    "the presence of an ambiguous component in a cmb polarization map significantly affects the science that can be derived from the map .",
    "in particular , experimenters attempting to detect @xmath1 modes in degree - scale experiments should be sure to take @xmath0/@xmath1 confusion into account when designing experiments @xcite .    in a pixelized map , aliasing of small - scale power significantly worsens the problem of @xmath0/@xmath1 mixing . especially considering",
    "the extremely blue spectrum predicted for the @xmath0 modes , experimenters searching for @xmath1 modes should be sure to heavily oversample the beam .    the e / b / a decomposition is likely to be useful in analyzing data sets . strictly speaking ,",
    "it is not necessary to perform any such decomposition : it is possible in principle to compute the likelihood function @xmath51 for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power spectra directly from the raw @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps .",
    "however , decomposing the map first may increase the efficiency of the analysis , especially if we are willing to simply throw away the ambiguous modes : the likelihood function will then factor , with the each pure subspace s contribution depending only on the corresponding power spectrum . aside from any increase in efficiency in evaluating likelihoods , the e / b / a decomposition will be useful in checking for systematic errors and foreground contaminants and for purposes of visualization .    in @xcite , we presented methods for finding orthogonal bases for the e / b / a components .",
    "in many cases it may be preferable to perform the decomposition directly in map space , without finding a basis .",
    "the green function approaches presented here are unlikely to be numerically efficient for large data sets ; their primary purpose is to aid in the visualization of the e / b / a decomposition .",
    "the decomposition can be performed fairly efficiently in map space , however , in the manner briefly sketched at the end of the last section : perform an `` impure '' @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition first , and then purify each component by finding a biharmonic function satisfying appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "numerical methods for efficiently finding biharmonic functions exist .",
    "finally , let us note that the @xmath0/@xmath1 decomposition shows up in the analysis of weak lensing data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the methods described herein may be useful in such analyses .",
