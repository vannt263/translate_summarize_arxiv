    "in recent years many experimental papers on enhanced faraday rotation in the systems with nanoscale inhomogeneities have appeared @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this increased research interest is largely motivated by the fact that the faraday effects is widely used in optical isolators , phase modulators @xcite , spin dynamics @xcite and etc .",
    "experiments found that the origin of the strong enhancement in the classical regime is intimately connected with the different plasmon @xcite resonances .",
    "the papers @xcite deal with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) random systems consisted of a solution with the embedded in it metallic nanoparticles . in such systems , an enhancement of faraday rotation at the frequencies close to the nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance frequency",
    "is observed in modest magnetic fields .",
    "other experimental papers @xcite were devoted to the plasmon induced enhancement of faraday rotation when an electromagnetic wave passes through a subwavelength thin metallic film with nanostructured surface profile",
    ". the surface profile can be in the form of a periodical grating ( as in the experiment @xcite where inhomogeneity is created by the periodically placed nanowires on the surface ) as well as random , as in case of randomly embedded nanoparticles on the surface @xcite .",
    "the theory , outlined in ref.@xcite for faraday rotation in 3d disordered media , could correctly predict many of the peculiar features of the experiments @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the faraday rotation angle in 3d disordered system is inversely proportional to the photon elastic mean free path , depends on the frequency , and has a minimum at the frequency of nanoparticle local plasmon resonance , due to a large scattering cross section .",
    "however , most of the experiments on enhanced faraday rotation are carried out with the subwavelength thin metallic films that can be considered as 2d systems .",
    "a consistent theory of faraday rotation in 2d disordered systems is absent .    in the present paper ,",
    "we theoretically consider the faraday rotation of light passing through a thin metallic film with structured surface profile . within a common approach",
    "we study both periodical and random surface profiles .",
    "we show that the plasmon scatterings on the inhomogeneities of surface profile lead to rotation angle enhancement .",
    "let a p - polarized wave impinge on the interface between two media ( see fig.1 ) .    .",
    "the external magnetic field is directed on @xmath0 . after passing through a thin film ,",
    "the incoming beam is rotated by the faraday angle @xmath1.,width=317 ]    the incident wave magnetic field @xmath2 is directed on @xmath3 . after passing the magnetooptical medium ,",
    "it rotates in the plane @xmath4 .",
    "the plane of incidence of wave vector is @xmath5 .",
    "the dielectric permittivity tensor of the system has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 if @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 if @xmath11 .",
    "the term @xmath12 describes the smooth surface and @xmath13 describes the surface roughness . here @xmath14 is the surface profile ( @xmath15 is a two dimensional vector on the plane @xmath4 ) that can be random as well as periodical and @xmath16 is the antisymmetric tensor .",
    "@xmath17 describes the magneto - optical properties of the medium , and we assume that the external magnetic field is directed on @xmath18 .",
    "the above geometry is more frequently used in the experiments .",
    "faraday rotation angle is determined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thickness of the film . assuming that the profile function @xmath21 is smooth and neglecting its derivatives , from maxwell equations one obtains a helmholtz equation for the magnetic field @xmath22 substituting eq.([tensor ] ) into eq.([helmholtz ] ) , it is easy see that equations for right - hand and left - hand polarized photons are separated @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we neglect the difference between left - hand and right - hand polarizations in @xmath27 because it is already proportional to a small parameter @xmath28",
    ". the faraday angle is determined through @xmath29 as @xmath30 because @xmath31 are continuous at @xmath32 , the same is correct for @xmath29 . from the maxwell equations and continuity of @xmath33",
    "follow the continuity of @xmath34 at @xmath32 .",
    "when the surface roughness is absent ( @xmath35 ) one can solve the helmholtz equation , eq.([helmholtz ] ) , for @xmath2 with the above mentioned boundary conditions and find @xmath36 where the reflection and transmission amplitudes are determined as follows ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37 here @xmath38 and analogous expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be written substituting @xmath41 by @xmath42 . substituting eqs.([backsol ] ) and ( [ reftrans ] ) into eq.([detangle ] ) , for the thick films @xmath43 one finds the well known result for the faraday angle @xcite @xmath44 in the thin film limit @xmath45 similarly , we find @xmath46 where we assume that @xmath47 . in analogous manner one can find the polarization rotation angle for the reflected wave @xmath48 note that in both limits the rotation angle does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ leftright ] ) consists of two contributions : one is caused by the smooth surface and the second one is caused by the scattering from the inhomogeneities @xmath49 , where the background field obeys a homogeneous equation @xmath50 the scattered field @xmath51 is determined through the green s function @xmath52 where the green s function obeys the equation @xmath53 below , we separately consider the case when the surface of metal film has a periodical grating and when the surface profile is random .      in this case",
    ", @xmath21 is a two - dimensional periodic function .",
    "one can expand the profile function into discrete fourier series @xmath54 where @xmath55 are two dimensional discrete vectors on the inverse lattice ; @xmath56 are the profile periods in @xmath57 directions respectively and @xmath58 .",
    "when one of the periods tends to infinity , one recovders a one dimensional periodical profile , considered in the experiment @xcite . substituting eq.([perprof ] ) into eq.([scafield ] ) , taking its 2d fourier transforms , and integrating over @xmath0 using the explicit form of @xmath59 , one finds @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the two dimensional fourier transform : @xmath62 it is worth noticing , that the presence of the @xmath63-function in the expression of @xmath27 will lead to the different values of any physical quantity at @xmath64 , while evaluating the integral over @xmath0 . to avoid the problem with discontinuous physical quantities at @xmath65 in our further calculations",
    ", we will take their value at @xmath66 .",
    "one has an analogous expression for the left - hand polarized component .",
    "note that the background field @xmath67 which is the solution of homogeneous equation eq.([back ] ) depends only on @xmath0 . in order to obtain the faraday rotation angle ,",
    "see eq.([detangle ] ) and fig.1 , we need to evaluate the coherent part of the scattered field , eq.([scafield2 ] ) , that is the part with wave vector directed on @xmath0 @xmath68 as it is seen from eq.([cohpart ] ) , the scattered field includes a green s function that has a plasmon pole which plays a crucial role in our study of the magneto - optic effects in 2d disordered systems .",
    "more precisely , when one of the wave numbers of the inverse lattice @xmath69 coincides with the plasmon wave number then the scattered field resonantly enhances ( see below ) .    in order to analyze the faraday angle , taking into account the scattered field , let us represent it in the form @xmath70 for the thin films @xmath71",
    ". at the resonance @xmath72 can be essentially larger than @xmath73 . at the same time",
    ", @xmath74 is proportional to the roughness height @xmath75 and is significantly smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "the latter is proportional to unity provided that @xmath77 .",
    "correspondingly the faraday angle will resonantly enhance provided that resonance condition is fulfilled .",
    "such an experimental enhancement of faraday rotation is observed in the recent experiment @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for the reflected wave the above mentioned effect is absent due to the fact that the denominator and numerator of eq .",
    "( [ faranglesc ] ) at the resonance are of the same order , i.e. , @xmath78 . for the thick films , @xmath43 , the resonance effect is possible .    in order to estimate the plasmon contribution to the faraday rotation angle for thin film",
    ", we assume that grating height is small @xmath79 and substitute the green s function in eq.([cohpart ] ) by the bare one @xmath80 .      for a given @xmath81 ,",
    "the green s function has a sense of magnetic field of a point source .",
    "therefore it satisfies the same boundary conditions as magnetic field , namely continuity of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . solving eq.([grfunc ] ) for @xmath35 with the above mentioned boundary conditions at @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath84 it is easy to find the green s function for other values of @xmath85 also .",
    "however for our purposes the above mentioned one is enough .",
    "note also that here we consider only @xmath32 plasmon contribution believing that it is more important due to the roughness at @xmath32 and not at @xmath86 .",
    "one can also be convinced that the green s function eq.([magplasmon ] ) has a pole . to find the pole",
    ", we equate the denominator of eq.([magplasmon])to @xmath87 . getting free from the square roots near the pole values",
    ", the green s function can be represented in the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 here @xmath90 describes damping of right - hand magnetoplasmon due to electromagnetic losses and we assume that @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from eqs.([magpole ] ) and ( [ cohpart ] ) that the scattered field and corresponding faraday angle will resonantly increase provided that one of the inverse lattice wave numbers @xmath69 coincides with the magnetoplasmon wave number @xmath93 , see also @xcite . using eqs.([magpole]),([magpoledet ] ) and ( [ cohpart ] ) and keeping only the resonance term in the sum of eq.([cohpart ] ) , from eq.([faranglesc ] ) one has @xmath94 , \\label{farangleper}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 characterizes the height of periodical grating . to get the plasmon resonance contribution into faraday rotation angle in the periodical grating case",
    ", one has to substitute the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 from eq.([magpoledet ] ) into eq.([farangleper ] ) .",
    "the final result , in the limit @xmath98 , reads as follows @xmath99 equation ( [ farperfin ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ ranfin ] ) ( see below ) represent the central results of this paper .",
    "the main difference of the plasmon resonance contribution @xmath100 compared to smooth surface metallic film contribution , eq.([thin ] ) , is that the former dependences on the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity @xmath101 . comparing eqs.([thin ] ) and",
    "( [ farperfin ] ) , we have @xmath102 for nanoscale metallic films , usually @xmath103 .",
    "taking into account that for noble metals in the optical region @xmath104 , one has @xmath105 .",
    "to apply the obtained results to the experiment @xcite , one can model the composite system consisting of garnet substrate with gold surface profile by an effective metallic film with dielectric permittivity tensor .",
    "the diagonal part of the latter is mainly determined by gold ( at optical wavelengths its absolute value is much larger than that of garnet ) and non - diagonal part determined by bismuth substituted yttrium iron garnet value .",
    "taking at @xmath106 @xcite @xmath107 , @xmath108 @xcite and @xmath103 , from eq.([ratioper ] ) we obtain that the plasmon enhancement factor is of order @xmath109 .",
    "that agrees well with the experimental value @xcite @xmath110 . for the profile periods @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "the resonant number is @xmath113 .",
    "note that faraday rotation angle for smooth garnet film , follows from eqs.([angleflat],[thin ] ) .",

    "the summation can be replaced by integration ( @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the area of the system ) . carrying out the integration over @xmath121 and making use of eqs.([backsol],[reftrans],[faranglesc ] ) , one finds for the real part of faraday angle , in the limit @xmath77 , the following expression ( @xmath122 ) @xmath123}{2}. \\label{percont}\\ ] ]",
    "this is a general expression , independent of the surface periodic profile model . for simplicity",
    "we discuss only constant harmonic grating case , i.e. , @xmath124 .",
    "the quantities @xmath125 are the local density of states of right hand and left hand polarized magnetoplasmons .",
    "because of translational invariance , they depend only on the difference of the arguments and therefore are independent of local point @xmath126 . expanding @xmath125 on @xmath17 ,",
    "one gets that @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the measurement of the rotation angle gives information on the density of states @xcite .",
    "more as a consequence of the periodicity of @xmath21 , the plasmon spectrum consists of energetic bands and gaps .",
    "the above mentioned derivative gets its maximal values at the edges of these bands",
    ". similar behavior for the faraday rotation was found in 1d periodical systems @xcite .",
    "now consider the case when the surface profile is random .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is a gaussian distributed random function @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the ensemble average and @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the root - mean - square roughness and correlation length , respectively . in order to average the faraday angle over the realizations of random roughness and to separate its real part ,",
    "it is convenient to multiply the numerator and denominator of eq.([detangle ] ) by @xmath132 , see also @xcite @xmath133 like in the periodical grating case , we decompose the magnetic field into background and scattered parts @xmath134 . in the denominator of eq.([multiply ] ) for small roughness @xmath135 , one can keep only the terms containing background fields @xmath136 . in respect to the numerator , one should keep only the terms containing the scattered fields because the terms associated with the background field are small for thin films : @xmath137 . for the real part of plasmon diffusional contribution to the faraday angle",
    ", one finds from eq.([multiply ] ) @xmath138 recall that the scattered field is determined by eq.([scafield ] ) and that the terms @xmath139 do not contribute to the real part of faraday angle because the denominator of eq.([realdif ] ) is real . to find the averages in eq.([realdif ] )",
    "one needs the averaged over random roughness green s function , taking into account the plasmon multiple scattering effects on the surface roughness ( see refs .",
    "random roughness leads to damping of surface magnetoplasmon due to elastic scattering .",
    "the final answer for the magnetoplasmon green s function , averaged over the randomness , reads @xmath140 where magnetoplasmon elastic mean free path is determined as @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in eq.([avgrfun ] ) we neglect @xmath143 compared to @xmath144 .",
    "we will take the contribution of the former into account in the diffusional propagator ( see below ) . in the weak scattering limit @xmath145 , the main contribution to the average quantities in eq.([realdif ] )",
    "gives the magnetoplasmons diffusion .",
    "using eq.([scafield ] ) one can represent the diffusional contribution in the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 magnetoplasmon diffusion propagator which is determined by ladder diagrams presented in fig.2 ( see for example @xcite )    , width=377 ]    summing the ladder diagrams in the limit @xmath98 , one has @xmath149 expression ( [ difprop ] ) was derived in the limits @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the propagator @xmath152 is obtained from @xmath153 by changing the sign of @xmath17 . calculating the integrals in eq.([difcontr ] ) in the limits @xmath98 and @xmath154 , we arrive at @xmath155 finally , using eqs.([realdif ] ) , ( [ difprop ] ) and ( [ difav ] ) , for diffusional contribution to the faraday angle , we obtain @xmath156 note , that the ratio @xmath157 has is the average number of scatterings of plasmon . a similar result for faraday rotation in 3d disordered medium",
    "is obtained in @xcite .",
    "however in 2d systems , faraday rotation is more sensitive to the number of scatterings ( square dependence against the linear in 3d case ) as well as to dielectric permittivity of thin film . near the surface plasmon resonance @xmath158 , the faraday angle enhances because @xmath159 .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ thin ] ) with the flat surface contribution , eq.([angleflat ] ) , we have @xmath160 if the diffusion of magnetoplasmon is realized on the film surface , i.e. , the inequality @xmath151 is met , then the condition @xmath161 should hold . as a consequence",
    ", the diffusion contribution to the faraday rotation angle can be the dominant one .",
    "now let us make some numerical estimates to clarify whether or not the mentioned inequality takes place .",
    "assuming that the roughness is created by the randomly adsorbed on the surface nanoparticles , we have : @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the radius of a nanoparticle . for gold nanoparticles with radius @xmath164 at @xmath165 @xcite , @xmath166 , @xmath167 @xcite and @xmath168 . the surface plasmon wave number @xmath169 and the constant @xmath170 in eq.([magpoledet ] ) are estimated as @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "the surface plasmon elastic mean free path @xmath173 is found from eq.([elmean ] ) to be approximately @xmath174 .",
    "if the losses are caused by the gold substrate , then the inelastic mean free path can be estimated using eq.([magpoledet ] ) and the above mentioned numbers , @xmath175 .",
    "so plasmon diffusion inequalities @xmath151 are not realized in ordinary conditions .    however , close to the nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance the physical situation is completely different , because the expression eq.([elmean ] ) , for the determination of the plasmon elastic mean free path is not valid any more . in this case",
    "the elastic mean free path can be estimated as @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the surface concentration of nanoparticles and @xmath131 is the cross section of the interaction of the surface plasmon with the nanoparticle .",
    "when the surface plasmon wave number coincides with the nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance wave number , the plasmon elastic cross section resonantly enhances up to several orders compared to ordinary situation , see for example @xcite .",
    "therefore , close to the resonance , the magnetoplasmon elastic mean free path becomes essentially smaller and the condition of its diffusion can be easily fulfilled .",
    "we have considered the faraday rotation of light passing through a thin metallic film with nanostructured surface grating . in the periodical grating case",
    ", the enhancement of the faraday angle happens when the surface plasmon wave number coincides with one of the wave vectors of inverse lattice , characterizing the grating periods on the surface . in the random surface profile case ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the faraday angle gives the diffusion of magnetoplasmons .",
    "if the random roughness is created by the randomly embedded nanoparticles on the surface , then the maximum faraday rotation angle of the transmitted wave is achieved when surface plasmon wave number coincides with the nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance wave number .",
