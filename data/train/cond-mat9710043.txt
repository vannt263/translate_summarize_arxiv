    "it is well established that in a classical two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of particles , interacting through a potential that falls off sufficiently fast with distance , long - range positional order can not exist at finite temperatures @xcite .",

    "anharmonic quantum fluctuations are important , leading to @xmath143 .",
    "iii ) a strong quantum fluctuations region , for @xmath112 , where @xmath73 has no singularities , but qlrpo exists with @xmath114 . as a result of strong quantum fluctuations",

    "it is instructive to estimate the amplitude of quantum fluctuations in the boson positions using a cage model@xcite .",
    "this model considers a single particle moving in the potential well produced by the other bosons , assumed fixed in their classical positions . in this case",
    "we find that , in the harmonic approximation , the boson zero - point mean - square displacement from its classical equilibrium position is @xmath145 .",
    "according to the discussion above , the semiclassical region corresponds to @xmath137 , for which @xmath146 .",
    "we propose that this last result be adopted as a kind of lindemann criterion @xcite to estimate the range of validity of the harmonic approximation for 1d interacting boson models in general .",
    "an important conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that , as far as qlrpo is concerned , the harmonic approximation gives a correct qualitative picture for the behavior of the cs model ground - state .",
    "the differences that we find between the exact result and this approximation , although large for @xmath147 , are quantitative rather than qualitative .",
    "the fact that this conclusion is reached in an exactly soluble model suggests that for other 1d boson models the harmonic approximation predictions for qlrpo are correct , at least qualitatively , well beyond the semiclassical region , as long as a phase transition does not take place .",
    "one possibility that can not be studied by our method is the existence of a superfluid phase .",
    "we believe that this phase can be ruled out in the cs model because the bosons are impenetrable . in 1d",
    "this excludes the possibility of a superfluid phase .",
    "the reason is that if one constructs the path - integral representation for the ground - state partition function , the superfluid density is related to the boson world lines winding number fluctuations@xcite . in 1d",
    "these fluctuations require that the boson world lines cross each other , which is not possible if the bosons are impenetrable . from this and from our numerical results",
    "we conclude that the ground - state of the repulsive cs model has only one normal phase with qlrpo .",
    "we believe that a large class of 1d models for impenetrable bosons interacting through a repulsive potential falling off so fast with distance to exclude true long - range positional order has a similar ground - state phase diagram .",
