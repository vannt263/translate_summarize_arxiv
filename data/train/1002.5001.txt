    "this closely mimics the fundamental approach of rc to gravitation in which geometric observables are defined via weighting of appropriate @xmath1-simplexes with scalar weights @xcite .",
    "in addition to the discrete differential forms one must introduce a hodge operator to map simplicial forms to dual forms in the lattice .",

    "there are distinct advantages to utilizing the circumcentric dual .",
    "it is this dual that appears to be most natural in rc @xcite because of its orthogonality to the simplicial lattice .",

    "the connection 1-form @xmath46 is defined on the edges of the simplicial lattice .",
    "the curvature 2-form is therefore determined entirely by the values of @xmath46 on its boundary ; @xmath47 here we utilize the fact that we integrate over the entire boundary which introduces a factor of @xmath48 into the contribution from each edge .",
    "it is assumed that the discrete forms are valued on the appropriate @xmath1-simplex such that we need only work with the scalar values of the coefficients .",
    "making the substitutions into the source - free maxwell lagrangian , the simplicial electromagnetic action becomes @xmath44 = -\\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\sigma^{2 } }   \\left (   \\sum_{l\\subset \\sigma^{2 } }   \\frac{|l|}{|\\sigma^{2}| } a_{l}\\right)^{2 } \\underbrace { \\frac{2}{d(d-1 ) } |\\sigma^{2}| |*\\sigma^{2}|}_{v^{(d)}_{\\sigma^{2}}}\\ ] ]    introducing source into the action requires the 1-form current @xmath49 , whose dual is the 3-form current current density , @xmath50 , defined on the 3-volumes dual to an edge .",

    "this introduces the interaction in the action @xmath51 while , gauge invariance of the potential 1-form under the transformation @xmath52 is automatically satisfied in the source - free terms of the action , invariance of the action should give indications of the conservation of source based on the transformations of the source terms . under the gauge transformation , the source terms of the action give @xmath53 under arbitrary gauge transformations , the invariance of the action implies @xmath54 where the first sum gives the kirchhoff - like conservation of the current 1-form , while the second sum is based on the more typical representation of the divergence of the current density 3-form .",
    "this result was first shown in @xcite where the projection of the four - potentional is equivalent to the construction here .",
    "this construction follows a path to that of the sorkin construction @xcite .",
    "however , by using only discrete differential forms we express the electromagnetic field in coordinate - free language determined by scalar weightings of simplicial elements .",
    "we thus avoid defining tangent - space - valued tensors in any strict sense as appears to be the base nature of gravitational variables in rc .    while the action ( eq .",
    "[ emaction ] ) is similar in character , it is explicitly distinct from the sorkin approach to electromagnetism on the spacetime mesh @xcite .",
    "sorkin s approach to the problem utilizes the full tangent space associated a @xmath5-simplex to determine the affine components of the maxwell tensor locally .",
    "the method presented here extends sorkin s original embedding of @xmath0 into the lattice to incorporate the more recent understandings of the dual lattice structure inherent in rc @xcite . using the dual lattice",
    ", one already finds that the spacetime curvature automatically decomposes into hinge - based curvature tensors proportional to the scalar curvature . in constructing the action ,",
    "these hinge - curvatures are weighted by the hybrid volumes described in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] @xcite as the determiners of the local measure on the lattice .",
    "this is a result of the projection of the continuum curvature 2-form onto the 2-dimensional polygonal faces of the dual lattice , the carriers of information of spacetime curvature .",
    "moreover we have shown @xcite how this construction leads to alternative descriptions of curvature at localized sites in the lattice .",
    "the simplicial electromagnetic action outlined above follows in the same spirit as curvature s manifestation in rc .",
    "the maxwell tensor is locally distributed on the 2-forms of the simplicial net and weighted by the corresponding hybrid volumes .",
    "this allows us the flexibility of stringing together chains of simplicial 2-forms to define locally simple maxwell curvature in the simplicial lattice , as was shown explicitly for spacetime curvature in rc @xcite .",
    "the discrete differential form approach to defining a field on a simplicial lattice for the two cases we have examined illustrate the construction and its usefulness for non - gravitational fields in rc .",
    "we have been able to construct analogous actions directly from the continuum action via projection of the continuum fields onto the corresponding elements of the lattice .",
    "the scalar field , in particular , provides an identical match to previous literature on scalar fields in rc .",
    "the action for the electromagnetic field differs from previous descriptions as we no longer require an explicit tangent - space - valued tensor to be constructed interior to each simplex .",
    "this compares well with computational electrodynamic applications for flat spacetimes . in the next section",
    "we extend this formalism and derive an action for fermionic fields that is consistent with the fundamental coordinate - free structure of and the flow of stress - energy in rc .",
    "before we derive our version of the dirac action in rc it is important to note some of the key elements that go into such a construction .",
    "these elements are pulled together from considerations of ( 1 ) the dirac field itself , and from ( 2 ) the simplicial lattice geometry .",
    "the first component is the need for an orthogonal frame for the construction of a dirac spinor .",
    "this is fundamentally related to the need to provide local representations of the dirac @xmath55-matrices .",
    "these matrices form their own basis in the clifford algebra of spacetime .",
    "therefore , one must be able to construct an isomorphism between the representations of the geometry of the spacetime ( the basis 1-forms ) and the @xmath55-matrices @xcite . in rc",
    "this is quite straightforward since we are provided with finite representations of spacetime whose basis 1-forms can be used to construct an orthonormal and holonomic frame . however ,",
    "this can not be taken too literally .",
    "as with the other fields , the dirac field is a spacetime - valued field .",
    "moreover , in light of the conservation of stress - energy as derived in @xcite , it is known that the flow of stress - energy is directed on the edges of the simplicial lattice .",
    "this should give some indications that the flow of field ( or particles ) , as the carrier of stress - energy , is also directed along the edges of the simplicial lattice .",
    "in the construction given below we follow this path by defining the dirac field on the simplicial geometry .",
    "the standard construction of fermionic fields uses an action given by @xmath56= \\int d^{4 } x \\ ; \\ ; i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{a}e^{\\mu}_{a}\\nabla_{\\mu}\\psi   - m \\bar{\\psi}\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the co - tetrad connecting a holonomic frame defining the covariant derivative to the orthonormal frame representation of @xmath58 .",
    "before we assign a simplicial form to the fields directly we note that the field @xmath59 is explicitly based in a representation of the double - cover @xmath60 and not in a representation of @xmath61 . in order to make the connection with our framework more clear we write the dirac action in a more suggestive form , @xmath56=   i\\bar{\\psi}(\\gamma^{a}e_{a } ,",
    "d ) \\psi   - m ( \\bar{\\psi},\\psi).\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the covariant exterior differential .",
    "here we view the first term as an inner - product between operators for purely illustrative purposes .",
    "one could also expand this first term into two by including the fields @xmath59 and @xmath63 in the inner - product with @xmath62 acting on @xmath59 in one term and @xmath62 acting of @xmath63 in the second . to keep the notation compact",
    "we will assume the first term in the action to imply @xmath64 in this representation of the action it is evident how one must embed the field into the lattice .",
    "the co - tetrad is naturally the simplicial 1-form since the tetrad is a dual 1-form ( defining the tangent space interior to a simplex ) .",
    "moreover , the covariant exterior derivative maps a 0-form to a 1-form on the simplicial lattice .",
    "the 0-form nature of the field suggests that the each vertex , @xmath38 , of the simplicial lattice is the natural placeholder for the fields .",
    ", i.e. without specifically assigning a basis or tangent space in which to represent the field .",
    "rather we are free to choose any simplex meeting at @xmath38 to determine the tangent space for the field .",
    "once a tangent space is chosen , the _ vielbein _ explicitly determines the spinor basis and matrix representation of the clifford algebra of the @xmath58 in the standard way @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath65 is then given by the projection @xmath66 which assigns a dirac matrix representation , in some appropriate basis , to the edges of the lattice . since",
    "each term in the action is a lorentz scalar , we can make the choice of basis independently for each term in the discretized action .",
    "@xmath56=\\sum_{l }   \\left(i\\left<\\bar{\\psi}_{l } \\gamma_{l } |d_{l}\\psi\\right > + c.c .",
    "\\right)v_{l}^ { * } + \\sum_{v } m\\bar{\\psi}(v)\\psi(v ) v^{*}_{v}.\\ ] ] here we take the value of the field on a given edge , @xmath67 , to be the average field on that edge .",
    "@xmath68 the ability to freely choose an appropriate tangent space greatly simplifies the expression of the action .",
    "in particular , since each edge has multiple simplexes hinging on the edge , we can define any edge - based term of the action in the tangent space of one such simplex .",
    "this reduces the covariant derivative of the field to a flat - space differential . as with the scalar field",
    "the derivative terms reduce to finite - differencing terms and we obtain a simplified discrete action without the need for spin connections .",
    "@xmath56=\\sum_{l }   \\left(i\\bar{\\psi}_{l } \\gamma_{l } \\frac{\\psi(v+l ) - \\psi(v)}{l } + c.c . \\right)v_{l}^ { * } + \\sum_{v } m\\bar{\\psi}(v)\\psi(v ) v^{*}_{v}.\\ ] ] this local action utilizes the the freedom to assign each flat tangent spaces to its fullest degree .",
    "this in turn reduces all derivatives and finite differences to their flat - space representations .",
    "this should simplify local calculations of the fields on the lattice .",
    "however , for non - local calculations using the dirac field , one will necessarily introduce a spin - connection to transform one representation of the clifford algebra to another .",
    "these are given explicitly by orthogonal transformations of the vielbein from one simplex to another .",
    "geometrically this is viewed as transport along the edge dual to the boundary between two neighboring simplexes . a short discussion of this transformation is given in @xcite where the dirac field is represented as a the dual - vertex - based action .",
    "the inclusion of sources into rc has been an area of active research for some years with various approaches modeled without a unified principle determining the implementation .",
    "this manuscript has provided an integrated framework based on differential forms for the embedding of fields into a simplicial lattice .",
    "the developments in computational electromagnetism using an approach called discrete exterior calculus ( or discrete differential forms ) together with our earlier results have led us to a formal theory for projecting smooth differential forms into a discrete pseudo - riemannian lattice .",
    "the utility of this approach is its dependence only on the lattice structure and geometry , and its explicit lack of dependence on coordinate systems .    for scalar and fermion fields ,",
    "the actions retain similarity to the more familiar finite - difference schemes on the simplicial lattice with appropriate volume weighting . for the dirac field",

    "the fields are directly encoded only on the edges and triangles of the lattice with dependence given by the incidence matrix of the lattice . by encoding the fields onto the simplicial skeleton",
    "we have also ensured a direct connection with the conservation of stress - energy on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the kirchhoff - like conservation principle tells us that the flow of stress - energy is directed along the edges of the lattice .",
    "this topological formulation supports the assumption that each field should be encoded onto the skeleton as we have suggesteed .",
    "encoding source fields on the simplicial skeleton provides a concrete and geometric connection between the field and its conserved current , i.e. stress - energy , under diffeomorphisms .    in canonical rc",

    "the work presented here identifies a framework for coupling source to field , in accordance with automatic conservation of source , in canonical rc .",
    "moreover , the representations of fields and their actions are do not require coordinization in the simplicial blocks . instead we assign appropriate scalar or spin - valued weightings to elements of the simplicial skeleton through projections from the continuum representation .    in encoding the fields in the simplicial geometry based on canonical rc , we define a universal prescription for assignment of field to the lattice .",
    "this provides a foundation for carrying over these derivations to model - dependent descriptions of simplicial spacetimes .",
    "reliance on only the canonical structure of rc without regard to specific dynamical behavior allows this approach to be universally applicable to numerical relativity or simplicial models of quantum gravity .",
