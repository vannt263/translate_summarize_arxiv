    "are suppressed by a typical mass scale of the susy particles @xmath12 , since the effective dipole interaction is dominant in the clfv processes . on the other hand , since the higgs - mediated effects are not suppressed by @xmath12 @xcite , these contributions to the processes could be sizable when @xmath12 is much greater than the tev scale .",

    "we investigated these mass - sensitive regions and the behavior of the ratio @xmath3 in some mass spectrum of the nuhm .    as a result ,",
    "when only right - handed sleptons have flavor - violation , there is some higgs - dominant region although susy particle masses are around the tev scale .",
    "we found it is necessary to consider the higgs effect in the region where the gaugino effect receives destructive interference .",
    "moreover , when sleptons are much heavier than charginos , cf . split susy models @xcite , we found that the ratio @xmath3 drastically depends on the mass spectrum structure and chirality of flavor violation .",
