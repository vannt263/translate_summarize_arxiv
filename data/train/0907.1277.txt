    "this is the second in a series of papers that aim to develop a method to do reliable computations in a spinless 2d lattice fermion model of hubbard type ; see @xcite for a concise summary . in the first paper in this series @xcite , an effective model for the low - energy physics of the lattice system was derived .",
    "it was shown that parts of the fermion degrees of freedom in the model can be treated exactly using bosonization . in this paper",
    ", we apply mean field methods to the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "we present analytical and numerical results showing that our method is useful for obtaining quantitative physical information about the lattice fermions .",
    "the difficulty to do reliable computations in 2d lattice fermion models of hubbard - type has remained an outstanding challenge in theoretical physics for many years .",
    "one can hope that a solution to this problem will be a key step towards a satisfactory theory of high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "one simple example is the so - called 2d model describing spinless fermions on a square lattice with local hopping and density - density interactions ; see section  [ sec2.1 ] for a precise definition .",
    "one of us ( el ) proposed a particular partial continuum limit of this lattice system @xcite .",
    "this leads to an interacting model of so - called nodal fermions , which have linear band relations , coupled to so - called antinodal fermions with hyperbolic band relations .",
    "it was found that this is a natural 2d analogue of the luttinger model , not only in that it arises as a continuum limit of the 2d model , but also since the nodal fermions can be bosonized and thus treated exactly . in particular , it is possible to integrate out the bosonized nodal fermions and thus obtain an effective model for the antinodal fermions ; see section  [ sec2.2 ] .    in this paper",
    "we use mean field theory to address the question if and when the antinodal fermions in this 2d luttinger model have a gap .",
    "these are key questions since if the antinodal fermions are gapped they do not contribute to the low - energy physics .",
    "we then obtain an effective hamiltonian of nodal fermions that is exactly solvable .",
    "we find a significant parameter regime away from half - filling where this is indeed the case . as a motivation for our work , we also present mean fields results for the 2d model that show that there is an interesting region away from half filling where a direct application of mean field theory fails .",
    "we find that this regime becomes accessible to mean field theory by using the 2d luttinger model .",
    "we recall the key parameters of these two models .",
    "the 2d model is characterized by the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping constant @xmath0 , the next - nn ( nnn ) hopping constant @xmath1 , the nn density - density coupling strength @xmath2 , and the filling factor @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec2.1 ] for more details ) .",
    "the 2d luttinger model depends on two additional parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which have the following significance . to derive the model ,",
    "it is assumed that there is an underlying fermi surface that , when the system is near half - filling , is a line segment in each nodal region .",
    "these are the so called nodal fermi surface arcs , and the parameter @xmath6 determines the size of these arcs .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath7 fixes the point about which the nodal band relations are linearized ; the details are given in section  [ sec2.2 ] .",
    "one important question addressed in this paper is how to fix the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "two - dimensional lattice fermion systems with repulsive interactions are often insulators at half - filling , but away from half - filling there are competing tendencies that lead to rich hartree - fock ( hf ) phase diagrams .",
    "a well - known example is the 2d hubbard model which , at half - filling , has an insulating antiferromagnetic ( af ) hf ground state @xcite .",
    "however , away from half - filling , unrestricted hf theory yields intricate solutions that include domain walls , vortices , polarons etc",
    ".  imposed on an af background ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "these solutions suggest that the pure af state is only stable at half - filling and that additional holes or particles tend to distribute so as to perturb the af state as little as possible .",
    "furthermore , away from half - filling , these solutions break translational invariance in a complicated manner and are highly degenerate .",
    "one thus expects that the low - energy properties of the lattice model away from half - filling should be dominated by fluctuations between these degenerate solutions .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to formulate a useful low - energy effective model for this situation .",
    "unrestricted hf theory is computationally demanding and thus applicable only for moderate lattice sizes .",
    "however , it is possible to find `` mixed '' regions in the phase diagram , i.e.  regions with intricate and highly degenerate hf solutions , already in mean field theory . by the latter we mean hf theory restricted to states invariant under translations by two sites @xcite .",
    "this requires little computational effort and thus allows to explore the full phase diagram for arbitrarily large lattice sizes . in this manner",
    "one can identify the regions in the phase diagram in which an exotic physical behavior can be expected .",
    "it is remarkable how rich the resulting mean field diagrams for the 2d hubbard model are @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present mean field phase diagrams for the 2d model , which is a spinless variant of the hubbard model and therefore somewhat simpler .",
    "we find a stable charge - density - wave ( cdw ) mean field ground state at half - filling @xmath8 , a translation - invariant normal ( n ) state far away from half - filling , and extended doping regions with mixed phases in - between .",
    "we indicate the mixed phases in our phase diagrams by horizontal lines to emphasize that mean field theory fails here , i.e.  it does not allow any specific conclusions to be drawn ; see figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "put differently , the mixed regions are `` unknown territories '' ( analogous to white spots on ancient maps ) for mean field theory , but the knowledge of their existence is nevertheless important physical information .    ) vs.  filling ( @xmath9 ) mean field phase diagrams of the 2d model ( a ) and the 2d luttinger model ( b ) for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . shown are the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) and normal ( n ) phases as a function of coupling and filling at zero temperature .",
    "the regimes marked by horizontal lines are mixed , i.e.  neither the cdw nor the n phase is thermodynamically stable .",
    "the cdw phase in ( a ) exists only at half - filling @xmath8 .",
    "the cdw phase in ( b ) corresponds to a partially gapped phase.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    our main result is to show that the 2d luttinger model provides a tool to explore these `` unknown territories '' using mean field theory for the antinodal fermions . to be more specific ,",
    "we compute mean field phase diagrams for the effective antinodal hamiltonian defined in section  [ sec2.2 ] .",
    "we find that the antinodal fermions indeed have a cdw gap in a significant region of the parameter space , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this also as a cdw phase , but we emphasize that , in general , it corresponds to a _ partially gapped phase _ of the 2d luttinger model .",
    "there are also the nodal fermions that are gapless , and these fermions can dope the system even if the antinodal fermions remain gapped and half - filled . in this way a large part of the mixed regions of the phase diagram for the 2d model",
    "is filled in ; see figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "we also study how sensitive the occurrence of a partially gapped phase is to variations in the model parameters , especially @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the derivation of the 2d luttinger model was inspired by important work of mattis @xcite , schulz @xcite , luther @xcite , and furukawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; see @xcite for discussion and further references .",
    "the phase diagram of the 2d model , at and away from half - filling , has been studied using various techniques .",
    "recent work close to ours is @xcite in which the possibility of phase separation is investigated ; see also @xcite .",
    "in particular , figure  1(a ) in @xcite is the same as our figure  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "note though , unlike @xcite , we do not necessarily interpret the horizontally lined region in our figure  [ fig1](a ) as a phase - separated state . instead , we only conclude that the considered mean field theory fails to give a stable homogeneous phase there .",
    "one motivation for our work are experimental results on high temperature superconductors .",
    "it is known from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite that these materials can have an electronic phase in which parts of the underlying fermi surface do not have gapless excitations . in particular , for hole - doped materials , one finds near half - filling that the degrees of freedom in the antinodal regions are gapped , while in each nodal region there is an ungapped fermi surface arc ; see e.g.  figure  5 in @xcite or figure  1 in @xcite .",
    "we believe that this suppression of accessible electronic states at the fermi level seen in experiments provide strong support for our approach . however , we stress that the emphasis of the present work is mathematical , and a confrontation of our results with experiments is postponed to future work .",
    "we use the symbol `` @xmath12 '' to emphasize that an equation is a definition .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the real- and imaginary parts of a complex number @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is its complex conjugate .",
    "we write `` @xmath17 '' short for `` @xmath18 and @xmath19 '' etc .",
    "we use bold symbols for matrices , e.g.  @xmath20 is the identify matrix . by `` @xmath21 '' we mean a numerical result `` @xmath22 '' .",
    "the fermion models considered in this paper are defined by hamiltonians of the following generic type @xmath23 with fermion operators @xmath24 labeled by a finite number @xmath25 of one - particle quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath25 equals the number of one - particle degrees of freedom that are included in the model .",
    "our normalization is such that @xmath27 the model parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the matrix elements of the kinetic energy and two - body interaction potential , respectively , and @xmath30 is the chemical potential .",
    "the model is defined on a fermion fock space with a vacuum @xmath31 annihilated by all @xmath32 .",
    "expectation values with respect to a given state of the model ( both zero and non - zero temperatures ) are denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "the state can be either the exact thermal equilibrium state or an approximate hartree - fock state ; it will always be clear from the context which is meant .",
    "the inverse temperature is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the two models we consider are defined in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "some results presented here are ( minor ) generalizations of the corresponding ones in @xcite , as further elaborated in appendix  [ appa ] .",

    "the interested reader can find more details in appendix  [ appa1 ] .",
    "a detailed derivation of the 2d luttinger model and its partial solution by bosonization were given in @xcite .",
    "here we first describe this model and then summarize the results from @xcite that we actually need .",
    "the 2d luttinger model involves six fermion flavors labeled by a pair of indices @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath68 .",
    "these flavors correspond to different regions in the brillouin zone of the 2d model , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ( two large squares for @xmath60 and four large rectangles for @xmath61 ) .",
    "the sizes of these regions are determined by a parameter @xmath4 in the range @xmath6 ( we used @xmath65 in figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "there are two more fermion flavors with @xmath59 and @xmath62 ( two small squares in figure  [ fig2 ] ) , but in this paper we assume that the parameters are such that the @xmath62 fermions are far away in energy from the fermi level and thus their dynamics can be ignored @xcite ( we discuss this point in section  [ sec5 ] , remark  2 ) .",
    "the momenta in the regions with @xmath60 can be written as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath46 in @xmath71 close to the points @xmath63 , @xmath59 , the band relation in ( [ eps0 ] ) can be well approximated by the lowest - order non - trivial terms in a taylor series expansion @xmath72 with @xmath73 i.e.  @xmath63 correspond to saddle points of @xmath74 if @xmath1 .",
    "this also explains why we impose these bounds on @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , the band relation for fermion degrees of the freedom corresponding to @xmath61 can be well approximated by bands linear in @xmath75 close to the points @xmath76 with @xmath5 another free parameter ( @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) .",
    "we use standard terminology @xcite and refer to the fermions with @xmath60 as _ antinodal _ and the fermions with @xmath61 as _ nodal _ , respectively . in figure  [ fig2 ] the antinodal points @xmath63 are indicated by dots and the nodal points @xmath64 by circles .",
    "the 2d luttinger model is defined by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 include terms depending only on the nodal and antinodal fermions , respectively , and @xmath82 are interaction terms with both kinds of fermions .",
    "it is obtained from the 2d model by certain approximations that amount to a particular partial continuum limit @xcite .",
    "a key assumption is that there is an underlying fermi surface in the nodal regions @xmath61 consisting of line segments ( `` fermi surface arcs '' ) and containing the nodal points @xmath83 for some @xmath84 determined by @xmath30 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; see ( [ fixmu ] ) .",
    "in @xcite we fixed @xmath30 by the condition @xmath85 , but in the present paper we work in the grand canonical ensemble and thus allow @xmath30 ( i.e. @xmath86 ) to be arbitrary in intermediate steps of our computations .",
    "no assumption is made on the fermi surface in the antinodal regions .",
    "as explained in @xcite , sections  2 and 6.2 , we need to restrict ourselves to parameters such that @xmath87}<1\\ ] ] with the same bound for @xmath86 as for @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we require @xmath86 and @xmath5 to be different from @xmath88 , since otherwise one has additional back - scattering terms in the 2d luttinger model which spoil a simple treatment of the nodal fermions using bosonization ; see @xcite .",
    "these conditions define the parameter regime of interest to us .",
    "the nodal fermions in the 2d luttinger model can be bosonized and integrated out exactly .",
    "this yields an effective model for the antinodal fermions @xmath89 that , in the local - time approximation @xcite , is given by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath90",

    "the filling factor of the antinodal fermions is therefore @xmath94 while the total filling factor of the 2d luttinger model is ( including the nodal fermions etc . ) @xmath95 see @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath9 in ( [ nu1 ] ) that is to be identified with the filling factor of the 2d model .",

    "the 2d hamiltonian is equivalent ( in a low - energy approximation ) to the effective antinodal hamiltonian in ( [ hlutt ] ) only if one takes into account the additive constant ( see appendix  [ appa2 ] ) @xmath106 with @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 ^ 2 -vc^2.\\ ] ] the constant @xmath110 is derived in @xcite , but in the present paper we only need that it is independent of the chemical potential : @xmath111    as we show later , the parameter @xmath5 can be fixed by the self - consistency condition @xmath112 .",
    "thus the effective antinodal model contains one more free parameter as compared to the 2d model , namely @xmath4 .",
    "as already mentioned , the results in @xcite are restricted to the special case in which @xmath30 is explicitly fixed by the condition @xmath85 , and they are written in a slightly different form . the interested reader can find details about how to obtain the results given here from the ones in @xcite in appendix  [ appa2 ] .",
    "it is not essential to work with the taylor expansion of the antinodal band relations , and one can equally well use the full band relations @xmath113 instead of ( [ epm ] ) .",
    "as we will discuss , the results for the band relations in ( [ epm ] ) and ( [ epm0 ] ) agree quite well for smaller values of @xmath4 , but for @xmath4 close to one there are some quantitative differences .",
    "furthermore , in the derivation of the 2d luttinger model , certain approximations were done on the interaction vertex of the 2d model ; see section  5 in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that this had no important consequences for low - energy scattering processes .",
    "we note here that these approximations were only necessary for processes that include nodal fermions , and it would be possible to use the full interaction vertex for processes involving just antinodal fermions . with this , and using the full band relation ( [ epm0 ] ) , one could derive a refined 2d luttinger model for which the 2d model is recovered by setting @xmath114 .",
    "we finally mention that the local - time approximation in @xcite was only done for simplicity , and it is possible to generalize our treatment here to take into account the full time dependent interaction .",
    "we hope to come back to this in the future .",
    "in this section , we discuss the mean field hamiltonians used for deriving phase diagrams and the procedure that allows us to identify the mixed regions . more explicit details can be found in appendices  [ appb ] and [ appc ] .",
    "the fermion models considered in the previous section are defined by hamiltonians of the type ( [ hgen ] ) .",
    "conventional hf theory at zero temperature and fixed particle number @xmath115 for such models amounts to considering the set of all variational states of the form @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 orthonormal one - particle states .",

    "we work at ( mainly ) small but non - zero temperatures ( unless otherwise indicated @xmath126 ) .",
    "this means that we minimize the full grand canonical potential ( including the entropy ) with respect to all hf gibbs states ; see appendix  [ appb ] for a full discussion .",
    "we will however set the temperature to zero in the current section to not burden the presentation .",
    "it is convenient to choose the slater determinant @xmath122 as ground state of a reference hamiltonian @xmath127 with @xmath128 the non - interacting hamiltonian obtained from the one in ( [ h ] ) by setting @xmath129 , and @xmath130 the matrix elements of the hf potential @xmath131 .",
    "this allows to parametrize hf theory by the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath132 defined in ( [ hr ] ) .",
    "as explained below , it is important to use the grand canonical ensemble , i.e.  to fix the particle number by adjusting the chemical potential @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 the eigenvalues and corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath132 and @xmath136 the heaviside function .",

    "the n phase is not gapped and doping can be monotonically increased by increasing @xmath30 , and therefore the hf energy is a strictly concave function of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , as we try to increase doping by increasing @xmath30 in the cdw phase , the hf energy of the n phase decreases faster than the hf energy of the cdw phase , and when both energies become equal at @xmath177 the doping @xmath181 in the n phase is significantly larger than the doping @xmath182 in the cdw phase .",
    "a possible interpretation of the mixed state in ( [ mixed ] ) is a phase - separated state in which parts of the system are in the cdw phase and parts in the n phase @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , for @xmath183 , a phase - separated state has lower variational energy than any simple mean field state .",
