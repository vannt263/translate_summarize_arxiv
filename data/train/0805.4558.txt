    "in many physical , chemical , biological processes , the behavior and orientation of rod shaped objects ( rso ) such as fibers , nanotubes , nanowires , dna , macromolecules ... suspended in a flowing liquid affect the transport , rheology , chemical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the suspension  @xcite .",
    "orientation control for the sake of aligning or separating rso , enhancing reaction between them , with other chemicals or vessel walls is important in many areas of science and technology such as sedimentation , blood flow , pulp and paper , polymer processing , microfluidic devices , ferrofluids ...    objects suspended in flow undergo two types of motion : smooth motion due to the average fluid velocity field and erratic random motion produced by the fluctuating fluid velocity , temperature and inertia driven motion .",
    "the resulting change in the suspension microstructure can have a significant effect on the mechanical , thermal , optical , electrical , magnetic and chemical properties .",
    "the objective of this work is to investigate the effect of non - turbulent flow on the rotational diffusion of a dilute suspension of non - interacting rso in a planar contraction and how its impact might be measured with an optical measurement such as dichroism or birefringence of the suspension .",
    "generally a fokker - planck equation accurately models the orientation state of non - interacting rso in hydrodynamic nonhomogenous flow and the main orientation parameter is the rotational peclet number @xmath0 that represents the interplay between the randomizing effect of temperature induced rotational diffusion and the orienting effect of streamwise mean rate of strain due to the flow  @xcite .",
    "two types of flow are of particular importance : simple shear flow and elongational ( or , extensional ) flow .",
    "simple shear flow is a velocity profile where the gradient in the fluid flow velocity is constant , whereas for elongational flow the sample is compressed in one direction and elongated in the other direction .",
    "such flows can be either stationary or oscillatory .",
    "the rotational peclet number measuring the relative strength of hydrodynamic interactions and brownian forces is defined mathematically as the ratio of hydrodynamic shear flow and rotational diffusion constant :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the hydrodynamic shear rate and @xmath4 the thermal diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the flow shear rate defined by @xmath5 with @xmath6 the velocity field in the @xmath7 direction of the flow ( see fig .  [ shear ] ) is related to translational degrees of freedom whereas @xmath4 , the brownian diffusion coefficient , governs the rotational motion of the rso around its center of mass and hence relates to rotational degrees of freedom .    the rotational diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is given by  @xcite :    @xmath8\\ ] ]    with @xmath9 the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 the temperature , expresses the influence of flow on orientation .",
    "usually it is determined experimentally from rso orientation studies in a constriction with flat walls .",
    "@xmath11 is the rso length @xmath12 its diameter and @xmath13 the solvent viscosity .",
    "non - interacting dilute concentration of rso of density @xmath14 , yield the conditions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the reynolds number defined as  @xcite : @xmath17 is much smaller than 2000 in order to have a non - turbulent flow .",
    "@xmath18 is solvent density and @xmath19 the width of the planar contraction ( see fig .",
    "[ shear ] ) .",
    "boeder  @xcite is the first to have studied this problem in the bulk of a flowing liquid from the theoretical point of view .",
    "he derived , without the use of the langevin formalism or the fokker - planck equation  @xcite , an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) governing the pdf @xmath20 describing the average orientations of the rso :    @xmath21 = 0 \\label{boeder}\\ ] ]    the above ode is derived for the motion of rso , of negligible cross - sectional area , in the plane of the flow , without any boundary conditions and in the dilute case .",
    "the angle @xmath22 describes the orientations of the rso with respect to the liquid flow direction ( see fig .",
    "[ shear ] .",
    "since the pdf @xmath20 is @xmath23-periodic one might write a fourier series solution valid for small and large values of @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath0",
    "we perform a perturbation analysis of the fourier series whereas for large values of @xmath0 asymptotic analysis might be done  @xcite .",
    "many improvements have been made since , to remove restrictions on the cross - sectional areas of the rso , consider rotational diffusion in three dimensions and introduce internal vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom within the rso .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a solution in closed form for the above ode with different analytical and numerical methods to obtain @xmath20 for a wide range of the peclet number @xmath0 and gauge the impact on orientation control and the measurable optical properties .",
    "another goal is to compare the analytical approach with langevin simulations of the pdf , under the same conditions in the bulk of a flowing liquid .",
    "this comparison is useful because it can confirm on one hand the robustness of the analytical methods . on the other hand it provides a necessary limiting bulk condition for similar simulations near solid surfaces .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we present an exact analysis of the ode ( see eq .  [ boeder ] ) to obtain the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , for a wide range of @xmath0 . in section iii ,",
    "langevin simulation and comparison with the exact results are presented . in section",
    "iv , large values of @xmath0 are treated along with scaling results , optical properties and flow control .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in this section , a procedure for the accurate numerical analysis of the ode ( see eq .",
    "[ boeder ] ) and its associated probability distribution function , @xmath20 , is given for a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "turbulence effects are known to take place for large values of @xmath0 ( typically for @xmath24 ) .",
    "although the above ode ( eq .  [ boeder ] ) ceases to apply beyond this limit , the present mathematical analysis is not limited by this , and numerical solutions may be calculated in our approach for values of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath20 is the solution of a second - order ode ( eq .  [ boeder ] ) .",
    "the pdf is @xmath23-periodic since the rso are indistinguishable when oriented at @xmath26 ; hence the @xmath23-periodic boundary conditions :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the pdf has to be normalised over the interval @xmath29 $ ] :    @xmath30    the determination of the associated pdf is consequently a constrained ( because of the normalization condition ) boundary value problem ( bvp ) eq .",

    "[ boeder ] .",
    "the first is a 1d equation that takes the form :    @xmath31    with initial condition : @xmath32 .",
    "this is mathematically sound provided the initial value @xmath33 and the constant @xmath34 are known as shown below .",

    "[ ivp1 ] ) and the initial value @xmath33 , have to be evaluated for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have developed two methods , described below , to determine @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "firstly , a direct method based on the solution of eq .",
    "[ ivp1 ] , and secondly a minimisation method based on a multidimensional secant method ( also called broyden method  @xcite ) .",
    "the direct method to evaluate @xmath34 and @xmath33 is as follows .",
    "the formal solution of eq .",
    "[ ivp1 ] may be given generally as :    @xmath39/2 ] \\times \\hspace{3 cm } \\\\",

    "it can analytically be shown that the lower limit @xmath40 is the only possibility compatible with the boundary conditions given by eq .",
    "[ bvp ] . performing a change of variables , the solution",
    "may then be written as :    @xmath41   \\times   \\hspace{3 cm } \\\\",

    "[ stable ] is more stable numerically than the previous one of eq .  [ unstable ] , since the numerically troublesome @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms are avoided .",
    "nevertheless when @xmath0 increases the @xmath44 $ ] term will cause problems despite the bounded values of the sine function , forcing us to turn to other methods based on extrapolation techniques .",
    "the constant @xmath34 is next determined from the normalisation condition of the pdf ( eq .  [ norm ] ) yielding :    @xmath45 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the difficulty in solving the ode stems from the fact that its nature may be modified when @xmath47 increases , turning the problem into a singular perturbation one in @xmath48 as detailed in section iv .",
    "we convert the deterministic equation of motion for the rso into a langevin equation by adding a random force term and analyze statistically the resulting equation .",
    "we start from the angular speed :    @xmath49    and add to it a random term @xmath50 with white noise statistical properties :    @xmath51    this means the hydrodynamic forces tend to act on the rso rotating them in the shear flow with an average angular speed @xmath52 in the presence of perturbating fast random orientations represented by @xmath53 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath22 becomes :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a wiener process  @xcite .",
    "this is an it stochastic differential equation ( sde ) ( see for instance gardiner  @xcite ) that can be transformed into a 1d fokker - planck equation that will be identified with the ode equation  [ boeder ] .",
    "a single stochastic variable @xmath22 it sde  @xcite of the form :    @xmath56    is equivalent to a 1d fokker - planck equation :    @xmath57 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d^2 } { d\\theta^2}[b(\\theta ) p(\\theta ) ] = 0\\ ] ]    identification with the ode equation  [ boeder ] yields the value of the coefficient @xmath58 as : @xmath59 whereas @xmath60 is a constant independant of @xmath22 .",
    "hence the sde writes :    @xmath61    the hydrodynamic forces tend to act on the rso rotating them in the shear flow with an average angular speed @xmath52 , given by eq .",
    "refangspeed .",
    "this completely characterizes the sde parameters as :    @xmath62    the method of integration we use , is a 4th order stochastic runge - kutta routine : 3o-3s-2 g developed by helfand  @xcite where 3o is third order , 3s is three stages 2 g means we need two gaussian random variables per step .",
    "order @xmath63 means the solution agrees with the average taylor expansion  @xcite of the series solution to order @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the integration step .    in order to assess the validity of the method , we ran several tests and compared the results to known analytical solutions .",

    "[ small2 ] and fig .",
    "[ large2 ] for small and large values of the peclet number .",
    "the results of the langevin simulation converged after @xmath66 steps toward the analytically determined pdf .",
    "in order to cope with the wide range over which @xmath0 may vary , we classify the various methods for solving the problem according to the value of @xmath47 . + for moderate @xmath0 in the range : @xmath67 $ ] , we can proceed either directly from the analytic solution of the first - order ode or once @xmath68 and @xmath33 are known , a simple 1d runge - kutta method is used to solve the first - order ode .",

    "we have the following two conditions :    @xmath69    in the above minimisation problem , the first condition comes from periodicity of the pdf , whereas the second expresses the normalisation of the pdf .",

    "@xmath85 is the legendre polynomial of order 2 and @xmath86 is extracted from the phase difference between the transmitted and reference signal whereas @xmath87 is extracted from the attenuation of light intensity .",
    "they found that sabd scale as @xmath88 for values of the peclet number as large as @xmath89 as they approach the saturation value of 1 .",

    "our results shown in fig .  [ dichro ] indicate that in our case , the sabd saturate to 1 and that might be attributed to the following argument .",
    "as the peclet number increases the orientational pdf becomes sharply peaked around @xmath73 that scales as @xmath91 .",
