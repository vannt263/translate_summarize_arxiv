    "_ driving mechanism _ in the main text we have stressed the novelty of the hjl driving mechanism . in conventional lasers ,",
    "the driving is due to a population inversion that originates from dissipative transitions in an open system .",
    "however , for the hjl the drive not dissipative and the energy gain depends crucially on mixing of qd states by the induced sc gaps without any population inversion .    in our toy - model",
    "the essence of the driving comes about through the mixed state @xmath152 which renders both @xmath153 and @xmath154 non - zero .",
    "therefore , irrespective of the eigenstate of the qd , the system can always decay to the other state and emit a photon . without mixing ( @xmath155 ) this is not possible .",
    "the energy required for the decay is supplied by the bias . with increasing @xmath48 the values of the amplitudes decrease as the eigenstates",
    "@xmath156 will become increasingly more like the eigenstates of @xmath42 . hence the driving saturates .    from the expression for the energy gain , we explicitly see the role of the sc phase difference , @xmath54 .",
    "first , the value of this phase determines the sign of the energy gain , and thus whether it acts as a gain or as an absorber of radiation .",
    "second , the ssrs with radiation amplitudes , @xmath53 , depend on the specific combination of phases , @xmath157 .",
    "hence , the ssr values of the optical phase must depend on the sc phase difference , which signifies a phase - lock between the optical phase and sc phase difference .",
    "we note that , because of this specific combination of phases , there are always two optical phases possible since changing @xmath158 yields an ssr with the same radiation magnitude @xmath56 but opposite sign . hence , the ssrs come in pairs @xmath55 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to conventional lasers where the driving is independent of the optical phase and all phases occur with equal probability .    as a final remark concerning the drive we note that the dipole @xmath159 completely saturates in the limit of @xmath160 , to @xmath161 in this limit the eigenstates of @xmath162 are the eigenstates of @xmath42 so that the amplitudes @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we need to solve the stationary self - consistency equation with the dipole of eq .  .",
    "here we see by inspection that @xmath76 is always a stationary solution since the dipole is proportional to @xmath165 .",
    "it may be unstable however against small fluctuations in the mode . by performing stability analysis",
    "we distinguish between the two cases .",
    "to find a ssr with nonvanishing radiation amplitude , we first divide both sides of eq .",

    "the solid curves represent the time - averaged currents which are the individual currents weighted with the probabilities @xmath102 , the stationary solutions to master equation   of the switching dynamics as explained in the text .",
    "the qd parameters are as given in the main text , @xmath181 and @xmath69 , and @xmath182 . ]    in the main text the dynamics of the hjl over longer times was described in terms of switching rates .",
    "it was argued that these switchings occur after such long times that the corresponding dynamics is decoupled from the dynamics of the lasing field @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the switchings always occur when the system is at an ssr of eq .  , @xmath79 , where the qd is in eigenstate @xmath46 .",
    "we additionally argued that ( for @xmath183 ) switchings that change the parity of the qd state occur at an even slower rate . even for @xmath184",
    "slower than the switchings @xmath85 . therefore ,",
    "when measuring over times much longer than @xmath185 but shorter than @xmath186 , we see an average intensity corresponding to the ssrs of many qd eigenstates with equal parity . after a typical time scale @xmath186",
    "the qd states switch parity and the average intensity corresponding to this parity is seen .",
    "the purpose of this section is to calculate the average intensity as a function of voltage for the even and odd parities separately and discuss some important features found in the corresponding curves .",
    "the average intensity can be found by solving the master equation governing the switching dynamics and finding the corresponding stationary solution .",

    "the summation is over the stationary solutions @xmath192 of all eigenstates , @xmath193 . to solve master equation   we need to find and diagonalize @xmath194 .",
    "we notice that this matrix has a left eigenvector with zero eigenvalue because @xmath195 .",
    "hence there must also be a right eigenvector with zero eigenvalue , which is the stationary distribution of probabilities ( @xmath196 for all @xmath72 ) when normalized to unity .",
    "since we are only interested in these stationary solutions we only need to find the right null vector of @xmath191 .",
    "we represent this stationary solution as @xmath102 , with a capital @xmath197 .",
    "hence , we can find @xmath102 when all @xmath198 are known .    to calculate the transitions",
    "@xmath189 we note that the switchings are accompanied by the emission of an off - resonant photon so that the rates follow from fermi s golden rule .",
    "the transition rates are then proportional to the product of @xmath199 $ ] , with @xmath200 the energy difference between @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "we note that the transitions go from eigenstate @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) , which are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath205 in the semiclassical approximation , @xmath206 .",
    "additionally we stress that the value of @xmath48 is unaltered during the transition , which is indicated by the @xmath207 in @xmath208 and @xmath201 .",
    "only after the switch will @xmath48 evolve to @xmath79 according to eq .  .",
    "to find the matrix elements of @xmath209 [ eq .",
    "] we only need to consider the interactions @xmath210 as the term @xmath211 will always yield zero contribution when @xmath204 .",
    "the two interactions imply two possible transition amplitudes distinguishing two types of emission : one far below and one far above the cavity resonance .",
    "since we are in the rotating frame , this translates to creating a negative frequency photon with @xmath212 , or creating a positive frequency photon with @xmath213 .",
    "we do not expect absorption of off - resonant photons as they are very scarce .",
    "taking the detuning into account , the photon energies are @xmath214 and @xmath215 respectively .",
    "the detuning may be neglected , however , as it is typically taken of the same order as @xmath216 .",
    "for this same reason we may also neglect the @xmath4 in the denominator of the density of states @xmath217 .    taking the above considerations into account we find the transition rates @xmath218 with this we can find @xmath219 and thus @xmath102 .",
    "we make some brief remarks about @xmath219 .",
    "as stipulated above the switchings only occur between different qd eigenstates .",
    "fluctuations that let the system jump from one to another ssr in the same qd eigenstate are exponentially small due to the large number of photons .",
    "thus @xmath220 if @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore , we note that when in a lasing eigenstate and starting at @xmath76 the system may evolve to both ssrs with @xmath222 with equal probability .",
    "hence the transition rate from a non - lasing qd eigenstate to the ssr with @xmath79 of a lasing qd eigenstate is half the value calculated in eq .  .",
    "for transitions between two lasing eigenstates it must be determined to which of the multiple stationary points @xmath79 the field evolves .",
    "this is done by integrating the time evolution equation of @xmath48 , eq .  , until one of the @xmath79 is sufficiently approached , using the radiation amplitude @xmath223 of the previous ssr as initial condition .    with the stationary probability distribution , @xmath102",
    ", we calculate some measurable quantities .",
    "first , the average number of photons in the cavity is @xmath104 .",
    "then the average number of photons that escape the cavity is @xmath224 , yielding the average emission power @xmath225 and the average current in the device @xmath226 .",
    "the latter because every photon emission is accompanied by a single charge transfer .    using the minimal model of the main text",
    "we calculate the current / intensity as a function of detuning .",
    "as mentioned above we plot the dependencies for odd and even parity states separately .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] .",
    "since the detuning is related to the applied voltage via @xmath227 , the peaks in the current , of the order of @xmath107 , are in a narrow interval @xmath108 of voltages .",
    "there are two kinds of discontinuities in the curves : kinks , that mark the thresholds of the lasing instability at @xmath76 in some qd eigenstate ( second - order transitions ) , and jumps , that signal the appearance of an ssr far from @xmath76 ( first - order transitions ) .",
    "the curves also show a relatively high probability to be in lasing qd eigenstates if available .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by considering that eigenstates at large @xmath48 are close to eigenstates of @xmath110 .",
    "this suppresses off - diagonal matrix elements , eq .  , resulting in a slower rate of transitions away from a lasing state . for the odd parity states in fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] , the time - averaged current drops to zero while a lasing state is still available .",
    "this is because the non - lasing solution in this lasing eigenstate becomes stable at @xmath228 and whereas all other states are nonlasing .",
    "the device then gets stuck in the ssrs at @xmath76 even though ssrs with @xmath229 are available .",
    "we have discussed in the main text that the large number of photons @xmath230 ( assuming @xmath231 ) in a cavity with a single josephson led requires high @xmath122 factors .",
    "this requirement can be easily softened , and the lasing can be achieved at higher damping rate @xmath4 , if we incorporate @xmath232 josephson leds in the cavity .",
    "since the leds are of ten nanometer scale , one can put hundreds of them even into a single - wavelength cavity .",
    "the resulting system certainly deserves to be explored in detail , and will be a topic of separate research presented elsewhere . in this note",
    "we just give some straightforward estimations .",
    "all @xmath233 qd dipoles are in this setup coupled to a single mode , were we assume equal coupling coefficients @xmath62 .",
    "the self - consistency equation for the radiation amplitude changes to @xmath234 assuming for simplicity all dipoles to be in the same direction with same or similar parameter values , we may simplify the sum over dipoles to @xmath235 .",
    "this yields @xmath236 for the ssrs .",
    "the optimal regime near the lasing threshold is achieved if @xmath237 .",
    "thus this corresponds to @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , the lasing threshold can be achieved at much larger damping rate @xmath239 .",
    "this also increases the number of photons in the mode .",
    "if we optimize the coupling to @xmath238 , the number is estimated as @xmath240 , @xmath233 times larger than the estimate for a single - led device . if we fix @xmath4 , @xmath62 and increase the number of wires in the device , the photon number scales as @xmath241 .",
    "note that in both cases the emitted power increases as well .",
    "it is respectively given by @xmath242 , for optimal coupling , and @xmath243 when only increasing the number of wires .",
    "it is likely that a large number of leds in the cavity greatly reduces the intensity fluctuations . with only one pair of qds",
    "the lasing intensity fluctuates down to zero as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] , in the main text .",
    "in contrast , the switching of only one of @xmath233 qds will hardly affect the intensity , so the relative intensity fluctuations are expected to be of the order of @xmath244 .",
    "likewise , the phase of the optical field will be barely affected by the switching in one nanowire .",
    "therefore the decoherence times may become significantly longer than in a single led hjl ."

    "<S> _ switching _ in the above discussion , we have assumed the qd to stay in a certain eigenstate @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it does not : the finite spectral width of the mode enables switching between the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> as shown below , the switching events occur on a much longer timescale @xmath82 than that of the relaxation of @xmath48 towards its stationary value , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this separation of timescales allows to consider the switching dynamics separately from the dynamics of the radiation amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> each switching event is accompanied by the emission of a photon with a frequency mismatch compensating the difference of energies between initial and final eigenstates , @xmath84 . for switchings not altering the parity of the eigenstate , the rates @xmath85 can be evaluated using fermi s golden rule that contains the effective density of photon states @xmath86 ( the tail of a lorentzian - shaped emission line of the resonant mode ) and the square of the matrix element , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 denoting the initial ( final ) state . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the switching rate can be estimated as @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the switching events are thus rare and the device stays in one of the ssrs between the events .    </S>",
    "<S> switchings altering parity are even rarer as they require the excitation of a quasi - particle above the sc energy gap @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger detuning of the off - resonant photon @xmath91 and an additional small factor @xmath92 result in a parametrically smaller rate @xmath93 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such processes do not conserve spin thus enabling switchings between dark and emitting states .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that , since the ssrs for different eigenstates have different values of @xmath79 , @xmath48 does not jump to the new stationary value upon a switching . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the amplitude will evolve to @xmath94 within a timescale @xmath95 , according to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason a switching event always involves different eigenstates rather than different ssrs at the same eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> the latter would require large fluctuations of @xmath48 that are suppressed exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timeline ] shows a sketch of the radiation intensity as function of time . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to common lasers , the hjl intensity fluctuations are large at timescales of @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ decoherence _ the intrinsic mechanism of decoherence in common lasers is a drift of the optical phase . </S>",
    "<S> for the hjl , this mechanism does not work since the amplitudes of the ssrs are locked to the sc phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> this renders switching the most important source of decoherence in the hjl . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , after switching from a lasing to a non - lasing ssr the radiation extinguishes quickly and its phase is forgotten . </S>",
    "<S> even if the next switching brings the system to a lasing eigenstate , the radiation will evolve from the initial @xmath76 to any of the two possible @xmath96 , with equal probability . </S>",
    "<S> since decoherence is due to switching , the relevant timescale is given by @xmath97 . despite the very different decoherence mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> this estimation is the same as for the common laser @xcite .     evolving in time . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) switching events not altering the parity of the qds occur at the timescale @xmath98 . after switching </S>",
    "<S> , the radiation amplitude attains its new stationary value at a timescale @xmath99 during which the qd remains in the same eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) switching events altering the parity occur at a longer timescale @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> these can change between the dark and lasing states . ]    _ average power and current _ the intensity fluctuations due to switching self - average at timescale exceeding @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged characteristics are expressed in terms of the probabilities @xmath102 to be in a ssr @xmath103 that belongs to an eigenstate @xmath46 . those are given by the stationary solution to the master equation of the switching dynamics , that is composed of the switching rates @xcite . in terms of these probabilities , the average number of photons in the cavity is given by @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the average emission power is proportional to the photon number , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for current in the device : since the emission of each photon is accompanied by a charge transfer , it is given by @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> an elaborated example of the current / intensity dependences is provided in @xcite . for the current - voltage characteristic </S>",
    "<S> , we find a rather complex structure beside a peak with a magnitude of the order @xmath107 , that is concentrated in a narrow interval @xmath108 of voltages in the vicinity @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> in this structure , two types of discontinuities are present : ( _ i _ ) kinks marking the thresholds of lasing instability at @xmath76 ( second - order transitions ) and ( _ ii _ ) jumps signaling the appearance of a ssr with stationary radiation amplitude @xmath53 far from @xmath76 ( first - order transitions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a relatively high probability to remain in an ssr with a large photon number . </S>",
    "<S> it is explained from the fact that eigenstates at large @xmath48 are close to eigenstates of @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> this suppresses off - diagonal dipole - matrix elements resulting in a suppressed rate of transitions from this state .    _ </S>",
    "<S> feasibility _ to show the feasibility of the hjl , we present here the estimations with concrete numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the sc gaps @xmath90 are typically @xmath111mev , so we can choose the qd energy scale @xmath112mev . to estimate the dipole strength @xmath113 , with @xmath114 being the quantum fluctuation of the electric field in the mode , we assume the cavity volume @xmath115 with the wavelength @xmath116 , and take @xmath117 for the atomic distance scale . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the maximum @xmath118mev .    with these two values for @xmath57 and @xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum damping rate required for lasing is @xmath119hz , corresponding to quality factor @xmath120 which is common for optical cavities . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this situation the number of photons @xmath121 . this can be enhanced by increasing @xmath122 and simultaneous decreasing @xmath62 so it remains @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> for photonic crystal cavities @xcite quality factors @xmath124 @xcite have been measured and @xmath125 @xcite have been theoretically predicted . </S>",
    "<S> this gives photon numbers @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the estimations of the emitted power and current at the peak do not depend on the choice of @xmath4 and are given by @xmath128nw , @xmath129na . </S>",
    "<S> the requirements on @xmath4 can be eased and @xmath5 enhanced by putting many josephson leds in the same cavity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this also increases the emission power @xmath130 and the current @xmath131 @xcite .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the feasibility of generating coherent visible light at half the josephson frequency in a sc nanodevice . </S>",
    "<S> the workings of the device resemble the spontaneous parametric down - conversion in nonlinear optics @xcite with the superconductors playing the role of coherent optical input . the novel driving mechanism results in locking between optical phase and sc phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence of the emitted light originates from the switchings between different quantum states of the device .    </S>",
