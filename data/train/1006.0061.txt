    "bound pair ( bp ) state and its dynamics are interesting recent topics in quantum physics and quantum information @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied the dynamics of a bp and the interaction between a single particle and a bp . within the large @xmath0 regime",
    ", we first found an interesting scattering process , coherent shift , between them .",
    "we believed that , this phenomenon should not be exclusive and could be applied to quantum device design .",
    "in addition , m. valiente _",
    "et al_. performed a comprehensive numerical simulation of such a scattering process , which is useful to understand this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it was pointed that a perfect coherent shift is hardly realized in such a uniform bose - hubbard system . in this paper , we present three examples to demonstrate how to realize the perfect coherent shift in both boson and fermion systems .",
    "we present two types of local bp for bose system and one type for fermi system .",
    "it is shown exactly that the perfect coherent shift can be achieved in such models .",
    "we find that for a bose on - site bp , the perfect coherent shift condition depends on the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction strength and the momentum of the incident single particle wavepacket , while for the other two types of bps , it is independent of the initial state in the proposed systems .",
    "our results indicate that the coherent shift phenomenon has a great potential for future applications .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce an extended bose - hubbard and the formation of the two particle bound state . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the coherent shift process for an on - site bp in the case of weak nn interaction .",
    "iv is devoted to the same discussion for the nn bp . in sec .",
    "v , we introduce the on - site bp in the fermi system and demonstrate how to perform a perfect coherent shift . sec .",
    "vi is the conclusion and a short discussion .",
    "we begin with the bose on - site bp , considering the scattering process between it and a single boson in an extended bose - hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath1    where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the particles creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath4 is the number operator at the @xmath5th lattice site .",
    "the tunneling strength and the on - site interaction between bosons are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "hamiltonian eq.([extend hubbard ] ) has an additional nn interaction @xmath7 in comparison to the original hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) in previous paper @xcite .",
    "first of all , a state in the two - particle hilbert space , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be written as @xmath8with@xmath9here @xmath10  is the vacuum state for the boson operator @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 $ ] denotes the momentum with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 $ ] is the distance between the two particles .",
    "the matrix representation for the hamiltonian operator @xmath16 in the basis @xmath17 is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "note that for an arbitrary @xmath21 , the eigenvalues of ( [ hk ] ) are equivalent to that of the single - particle @xmath22-site tight - binding chain system with one abnormal nn hopping amplitude @xmath23 between @xmath24th ( @xmath25 )  and @xmath26st site ( @xmath27 ) , and the on - site potentials @xmath28 , @xmath7 and @xmath29  at @xmath24th , @xmath26st and @xmath30th sites respectively .",
    "it follows that in each @xmath21-invariant subspace , there are three types of bound states arising from the on - site potentials under the following conditions . in the case with @xmath31 ,  the particle can be localized at either @xmath24th  or @xmath26st  site , corresponding to ( i ) the on - site bp state , or ( ii ) the nn bp state .",
    "interestingly , in the case of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the particle can be in the bonding state ( or anti - bonding state ) between @xmath35th  and @xmath26st  sites , which was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in previous works",
    "@xcite , the bound states of ( i ) and ( ii ) were well investigated . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the coherent shift of an on - site bp occurs when it meets a single particle . in the following we focus on the scattering process between a bp and a single particle in the presence of the nn interaction .",
    "we will show exactly that the nn interaction can lead to the  perfect coherent shift .",
    "now we start with the on - site bp state .",
    "the formation of bound pair state in the bose - hubbard system was studied in ref . @xcite . here in the extended bose - hubbard model ,",
    "the on - site bp corresponds to the bp bounded by @xmath0 in the case of large @xmath0  but weak @xmath7 , with @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", the solution of @xmath37  has the form@xmath38with eigenenergy@xmath39one can see that the on - site bp state acts as a composite particle with effective hopping strength being @xmath40 . according to ref .",
    "jlbp , the effective hamiltonian for a single on - site bp and a single particle  in the extended bose - hubbard system can be obtained in the form@xmath41where @xmath42  and @xmath43  denote the hardcore bosons satisfying the following commutation relations @xmath44=$ ] @xmath45=$ ] @xmath46=0,$ ] @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; @xmath49 .",
    "the former two terms of @xmath50 depict the hoppings while the last two terms depict the interaction bewtween the two kinds of particles . considering the scattering problem without loss of generality",
    ", we set the particle @xmath51 at the @xmath24th site and incident the particle @xmath52 from @xmath53 at the beginning .",
    "for the scattering process between them within short duration , the particle @xmath54 is static compared to the single particle @xmath55 .",
    "then the whole scattering process dominantly governed by    @xmath56    at the condition @xmath57 .",
    "here we neglected the terms with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the swapping process between a single particle and a on - site bp is the key of the coherent shift , which is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ swap](a ) .",
    "the scattering process is represented in the form    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the reflection and transmission ( coherent shift ) amplitudes , respectively .    in order to investigate the above hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ h_scatt ] ) , we define a new set of basis @xmath63 as@xmath64and then reduce the two - body problem to a single particle problem . actually , acting the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h_scatt ] )  or the original hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ extend hubbard ] ) on the basis ( [ bp_basis ] ) , we obtain the equivalent single particle hamiltonian    @xmath65    the physics of the equivalent hamiltonian is obvious , which describes a particle in the chain with an embedded impurity .",
    "the impurity consists of two neighboring sites with identical on - site potentials @xmath66 and the tunneling strength @xmath67  between them .",
    "[ single ] is a schematic illustration for the equivalent hamiltonian .  then the scattering process of eq .",

    ", we have the nn coupling constant @xmath82 , where    @xmath83    it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) is available for any @xmath21 ,  since @xmath84  is always in the order of @xmath6 .  in practice",
    ", this process can be implemented via a broad wavepacket . for the case of @xmath85 , which corresponds to the stablest and fastest wave packet @xcite",
    ",  we can generate a unitary swap between an on - site bp and a single particle under the condition @xmath86 . in this condition , the @xmath21 dependent transmission coefficient  @xmath87 .",
    "then we get the conclusion that the perfect coherent shift can be achieved in the large @xmath0 bose - hubbard model with weak nn interaction .",
    "now we consider another kind of bound pair in the extended bose - hubbard model ( [ extend hubbard ] ) . this bound pair is bounded by the nn interaction @xmath7 , rather than the on - site interaction @xmath0 . in large @xmath7 limit , @xmath88,@xmath89 , a pair of hardcore bosons",
    "can be bounded by the nn interaction @xmath7 .",
    "this was pointed out by m. valiente _",
    "et al_. in their work @xcite . in such condition",
    ", the dynamics of a single boson and an nn bp can be depicted by the following effective hamiltonian@xmath90where the nn pair operator is defined as @xmath91 . for the scattering process between the nn bp and the single particle within short duration",
    ", it is dominantly governed by the first term , which includes the hopping of a single particle and the swapping between them .",
    "the swapping process is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "we consider the scattering problem between a single particle and an nn bp .",
    "initially , an nn bp @xmath92 is located at the dimer of sites @xmath93 and @xmath94 , while a single particle @xmath95 is located at the left .",
    "similarly , we can define a set of basis @xmath96 as@xmath97acting the hamiltonian eq.([heff_v ] ) on the basis eq.([v_bp_basis ] ) , after neglecting the high order terms @xmath59 and @xmath98 , we obtain a unifirm tight - binding chain .",
    "obviously , such a system can realize the perfect coherent shift for any incident single particle wave with the shift distance being _ two lattice spacings_. comparing to the previous on - site bp , the perfect coherent shift of the nn bp is @xmath21 independent .",
    "as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonzero reflection of a single incident particle in the coherent shift process @xcite is attributed to the swapping strength  being @xmath67 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "essentially , this arises from the identity of two particles of the bound pair .",
    "consequently , for a system with the bound pair consists of two particles with opposite spins , the unexpected reflection should be avoidable .",
    "now we turn to the fermi system .",
    "a one - dimensional fermi - hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath99where @xmath100 is the creation operator of the fermion at the site @xmath5 with spin @xmath101 and @xmath0 is the on - site interaction .",
    "similarly , there also exists bound pair state in such a system .",
    "actually , a state in the two - particle hilbert space with spin zero can be written as the form of eq .",
    "( [ psi_k ] ) , where we redefine the corresponding basis as    @xmath102    then all the analysis for the formation of a bose on - site bp can be applied completely on that of a fermi on - site bp . besides , in the large @xmath0 limit , the effective hamiltonian describing the dynamics of a single particle and a fermi on - site bp has the form @xmath103where @xmath104 is the projected fermion creation operator , @xmath105  is the on - site bp operator .",
    "the projector @xmath106 allows to create an electron with spin @xmath107at the site @xmath5 only if there is no other electron on that site . for the scattering process between @xmath108 and @xmath109 within short duration",
    ", it is dominantly governed by the first term , which includes the hopping of the single particle and the swapping between them .",
    "the swapping process is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ swap](c ) .",
    "we note that the swapping operation @xmath110 has the same coupling strength with the term @xmath111 .",
    "this allows the perfect coherent shift .",
    "in addition , such a process is independent of the momentum of the incident particle and the spin polarization , since the bound pair is singlet .",
    "in summary , we present three kinds of bound pairs and the corresponding optimal systems , which can avoid unexpected reflection in the coherent shift process . it is shown exactly that the perfect coherent shift can be achieved in the simply engineered systems . for a bose on - site bp",
    ", the perfect coherent shift requires the resonant condition , which depends on the nn interaction strength and the momentum of the incident single particle wavepacket . for a bose",
    "nn bp and a fermi on - site bp , the perfect coherent shifts occur for an arbitrary initial state in the simple chain systems .",
    "we believe that our findings have a great potential for future applications ."
