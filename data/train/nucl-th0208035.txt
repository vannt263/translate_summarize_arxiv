    "pairing correlation in hadronic matter has been attracting attention due to close relationship between properties of neutron stars and its interior superfluidity .",
    "superfluidity inside neutron stars affects , for instance , heat capacity and neutrino emissivity .",
    "these quantities relate to the cooling processes of neutron stars .    in neutron stars ,",
    "several types of baryon pairing appear .",
    "it is strongly believed that neutrons form the @xmath3 pair in the inner crust region  @xcite . at the corresponding density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter , the @xmath3 partial wave of the nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) interaction is attractive : in infinite matter an attraction ,",
    "no matter how weak it is , brings about the bcs instability to the ground state .",
    "this type of pairing has been most extensively studied for decades using various models . also important",
    "is the @xmath6 neutron pairing in the outer core region up to @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath6 partial wave of the _ nn _ interaction is attractive enough there for neutrons to be in a superfluid state  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath3 partial wave would become repulsive there so that the @xmath3 neutron pairs would disappear .",
    "instead , the @xmath3 proton pairing is expected to be realized owing to its small fraction  @xcite .    in the inner core region ,",
    "baryon density becomes much larger ( @xmath8 ) and various hyperons may appear  @xcite .",
    "some are expected to form pairs in the same way as the _ nn _ pairing owing to the attractive @xmath3 partial wave of the hyperon - hyperon ( _ yy _ ) interaction .",
    "moreover , interspecies pairing such as @xmath1-neutron pairing may be realized at the total baryon densities higher than @xmath9 where fractions of the two kinds of baryon are expected to be comparable .",
    "these kinds of pairings affect the properties of neutron stars through , say , suppression of the hyperon direct urca processes . whether @xmath1 hyperons are in a super state or not plays a decisive role for the microscopic understanding of neutron stars : @xmath1 hyperons in a normal state would lead to too rapid cooling of them and force one to modify the cooling scenarios .",
    "conversely , one can extract information on baryonic force and inner structure of neutron stars from these phenomena . studying neutron stars",
    "thus is the driving forces for the study on baryon superfluidity .    despite the situations , magnitude of the hyperon pairing gaps is still uncertain .",
    "more studies are needed exploiting available information from various sources such as the hypernuclear spectroscopy , direct observation of neutron stars , and so on .",
    "our aim of this study is twofold .",
    "one is to explore an effect of dirac effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons on the @xmath0 pairing correlations in binary mixed matter composed of @xmath1 hyperons and nucleons . in this respect , recognizing the significance of covariant representation led to the remarkable developments in nuclear / hadron physics for the last three decades .",
    "as is well known nowadays , cancellation between large lorentz scalar and vector fields provides a proper saturation mechanism of nuclear matter on the whole .",
    "typical examples are the phenomenological relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model and the microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach . especially in the latter , selfconsistent treatment of a nucleon spinor with a bare _ nn _ interaction brings the saturation points predicted by the nonrelativistic bhf approach towards the empirical one by a repulsive relativistic effect .",
    "this selfconsistency is the key ingredient of the relativistic models .",
    "then , we would like to ask a following question : what does the selfconsistency bring to superfluidity in the composite hadronic matter ? this is an important issue on studying neutron star matter that has complex composition of baryons using relativistic models .",
    "the other is to investigate an impact of the recent experimental finding on the @xmath0 pairing .",
    "the kek - ps experiment e373 , especially the `` nagara '' event  @xcite may explode the `` old '' information of @xmath0 interaction which has ruled hypernuclear systems for three decades .",
    "the event unambiguously determined the binding energy of the two @xmath1 hyperons @xmath10 in @xmath11he .",
    "most importantly , it suggests that the @xmath0 interaction is weaker than it was thought before .",
    "if this is confirmed , the new information ought to have a significant impact on the microscopic understanding of the properties of neutron stars .    unlike the _",
    "nn _ pairing , there are only a few studies on the hyperon pairing .",
    "it was first studied in a nonrelativistic framework by  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "then their results were applied to the study on cooling of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "they obtained the @xmath0 pairing gap in symmetric nuclear matter using an interaction based on the _",
    "g_-matrix in symmetric nuclear matter and an approximation of nonrelativistic effective mass obtained from single - particle energies with first order hartree - fock corrections , though their motive was application to the physics of neutron stars .",
    "their conclusion was that the maximal pairing gap became larger as the background density increased ; at the same time , the effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons became smaller .",
    "since smaller effective mass generally leads to smaller pairing gap , this conclusion is against general expectations .",
    "@xcite subsequently studied the problem using two types of bare @xmath0 interactions and of hyperon core models  @xcite .",
    "aiming at a better approximation of neutron star matter , they used the nonrelativistic effective mass which was obtained from the _ g_-matrix calculation for composite matter of neutrons and @xmath1 hyperons , and was dependent on a total baryon density and a @xmath1 fraction .",
    "their gaps were somewhat smaller than  @xcite s due to smaller effective mass and appropriate choice of the interaction .",
    "they also showed that the result had considerable dependence on the interactions and the hyperon core models owing to related uncertainties . an important thing in common to these past studies is use of the @xmath0 interactions that are too attractive considering the consequence of the nagara event , which was unavailable at that time .",
    "therefore , we study the @xmath3 @xmath0 pairing in binary mixed matter of nucleons and @xmath1 hyperons using relativistic interactions that reflects the new experimental information for the first time .",
    "the @xmath1 hyperons are immersed in pure neutron matter or symmetric nuclear matter that is treated as a background .",
    "we use the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model in which density - dependence of the interaction is automatically taken into account via the lorentz structure .",
    "the density - dependence that is an inherent mechanism in relativistic models may lead to novel behavior of the pairing gap : since pairs are formed in medium , medium effects on a particle - particle ( ) channel interaction should be considered . in the rhb model ,",
    "bare baryon masses are reduced by the scalar mean field .",
    "this decreased mass is the dirac effective mass  @xcite .",
    "the mass decrease may change the pairing gap to some extent in comparison with that obtained with the bare masses .",
    "although the two preceding studies also introduced the medium effects , each had a purely nonrelativistic origin .",
    "it has nothing to do with the lorentz structure and the dirac effective mass .",
    "we thus intend to compare with the results of the first study by  @xcite neglecting , for the time being , complexity of @xmath1-@xmath12 mixing that probably occurs in asymmetric nuclear matter ; this mixing will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lambda - sigma - mixing ] . besides",
    ", other constituents predicted to exist in neutron stars and equilibration like chemical equilibrium of neutron star matter are ignored so that we narrow down arguments to the impact of the revision on the @xmath0 pairing properties .",
    "such a plain treatment should be taken as the very first step of our study on the hyperon pairing with the recently revised interactions in neutron star matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we illustrate the lagrangian of the system and the gap equation for the @xmath3 @xmath0 pairing . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results - discussions ] , we present results of the @xmath0 pairing properties in the binary hadronic matter .",
    "section  [ sec : summ ] contains a summary .",
    "our starting model lagrangian of the system has the following expression : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the symbols @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the mass of nucleons , @xmath1 hyperons , @xmath22 bosons , @xmath23 mesons , @xmath24 bosons , and @xmath25 mesons , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : param ] displays these masses , coupling constants and their ratios used in this study .",
    "this model lagrangian was used in the study of binding energy of double @xmath1 hypernuclei with the rmf model  @xcite , and originally proposed by  @xcite in the study of multiply strange hadronic systems including baryon species @xmath26 , @xmath1 , and @xmath27  @xcite . the parameter set",
    "was determined by  @xcite to reproduce the bulk properties of hadronic matter and finite nuclear systems including double @xmath1 hypernuclei according to the old information . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the original nucleon lagrangian hs ( an abbreviation of horowitz - serot ) with `` @xmath22-@xmath23 '' lagrangian for the @xmath1 sector , which is called `` model  1 , '' was supplemented with two additional boson fields .",
    "one is a scalar - isoscalar boson @xmath24 ( 975 mev ) and the other is a vector - isoscalar meson @xmath25 ( 1020 mev ) .",
    "the lagrangian that contains @xmath24 and @xmath25 is referred to as `` model  2 . ''",

    ". details of the model  1 and the model  2 are described in ref .",
    "these additional bosons were originally introduced to achieve strong attraction between @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "since it is , however , probable now that @xmath0 interaction is weaker than it was considered as mentioned above , we regard @xmath24 as the device for controlling the @xmath0 attraction in this study . as a rough guide",

    "the equations of motion are solved by the procedure illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that pairing correlation is introduced by the gorkov factorization and hyperons other than @xmath1 are absent in the present study .",
    "the fock contribution is neglected and the so - called no - sea approximation is employed .",
    "this is the rhb model . as for the pairing gap , the gap equation ,",
    "@xmath45 is solved numerically , where @xmath46 is the single - particle energy of @xmath1 hyperons and @xmath47 is the channel @xmath0 interaction .",
    "although the quality of bare @xmath0 interactions on the market is steadily getting higher , they still have room for improvement mainly due to sparsity of experimental data .",
    "hence , also does predictability of the @xmath0 pairing properties .",
    "following the same prescription as in our previous studies of _ nn _ pairing  @xcite , we therefore use the phenomenological interaction to study the possibility of the @xmath0 pairing and its dependence on the density of background matter .",
    "we adopt to the channel interaction the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) interaction obtained from an rmf parameter set with the help of form factors . for convenience",
    ", we refer to this obe interaction as `` rmf interaction '' in this study .",
    "the antisymmetrized matrix element of the rmf interaction @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 where tildes denote time reversal . since @xmath50 depends on the dirac effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons in a baryon spinor ,",
    "its dependence is explicitly indicated in eqs .   and  .",
    "integration with respect to the angle between @xmath51 and @xmath52 has been performed in eq .",
    "to project out the _ s_-wave component .",
    "moreover , the form factors are included in @xmath50 to regulate its high - momentum contributions .",
    "we use a bonn - type form factor : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is three - momentum transfer and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) are the meson masses .",
    "the cutoff mass @xmath57 is @xmath58 @xmath59 for all the mesons employed , which value was determined in our study of the _ nn _ pairing for a form factor of a type different from eq .",
    "@xcite ; an effect of varying the cutoff mass will be examined later .",
    "we thereby aim at phenomenological construction of the effective @xmath0 interaction usable in hadronic matter with a finite @xmath1 fraction , like the gogny force in the nucleon sector .",
    "note that the form factors are applied only to the p - p channel since we respect the fact that the hartree part is unaffected by a monopole form factor ( eq .   shown later ) with which the value of @xmath57 was determined in our study of the _ nn _ pairing .    combining the equations for the dirac effective mass of nucleons @xmath60 that of @xmath1 hyperons @xmath61 and eq .  , we obtain the coupled equations to be solved numerically .    concerning choice of the channel interaction , it has been still open to argument whether the _ g_-matrix or a bare interaction is suitable for the gap equation . the channel interaction in ref",
    ".  @xcite is classified into the former and that in ref .",
    "@xcite into the latter .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gap equation itself handles short range correlations which the _ g_-matrix also does ; this is the well - known double - counting of the correlations .",
    "@xcite also argued that use of the _ g_-matrix itself or the interaction based on it in the gap equation can not be justified  @xcite .",
    "thus it is widely received to use a bare interaction in the gap equation with regard to _ nn _ pairing in infinite matter .    meanwhile , from a practical viewpoint such as application to finite nuclei , the gogny force is often used as the channel interaction as well as the particle - hole channel interaction : while it is regarded as a reasonable parameterization of the _ g_-matrix in the sense that it gives saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter , it can reproduce the pairing gaps obtained from bare _ nn _ interactions .",
    "in fact , the gogny force imitates bare interactions in the low - density limit  @xcite . with reference to practical usage",
    ", @xcite solved the gap equation of _ nn _ pairing using the rmf interactions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , phenomenological form factors were introduced to the channel , with the hartree part unchanged , so that the constructed interactions reproduced the results obtained from the _ bare _ bonn potential .",
    "they successfully adjusted cutoff masses to reproduce both the pairing gaps and the coherence lengths at the same time .",
    "the cutoff masses independent of density were qualitatively similar to those of the bonn potential .",
    "this shows the usefulness of the prescription .",
    "nonetheless , we do not use the same procedure in the present study since we have no model of the _ yy _ interactions to follow and our primary interest is behavior of the gap ; we use the cutoff mass for the @xmath0 interaction obtained from the study of the _ nn _ pairing  @xcite instead , which is qualitatively similar to those of the _ yy _ interactions on the market .",
    "last but not least , we neglect effects beyond the mean - field approximation such as the dispersive effects  @xcite and the polarization effects  @xcite to concentrate on the effects which stem from the binary character of the matter .",
    "both are , however , very important for the _ nn _ pairing since they turned out to reduce the pairing gap . work in this direction is necessary in future .",
    "figure  [ fig : neutgap ] shows the resulting @xmath3 @xmath0 pairing gap at the fermi surface in pure neutron matter of densities @xmath62 at @xmath63 , @xmath5 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 chosen .",
    "this value of the coupling ratio can reproduce the bond energy , eq .",
    ", of about @xmath67 mev in the rmf model , which is suggested by the nagara event .",
    "contrary to the results obtained by  @xcite , the @xmath0 pairing gap becomes suppressed as the neutron density increases . at @xmath2 , where @xmath1 hyperons already appear in some models of neutron stars  @xcite , the maximal pairing gap is about @xmath68 mev . since there are probably no @xmath1 hyperons at @xmath69 and @xmath5 in neutron star matter , the pairing gaps at these densities are quite hypothetical .",
    "figure  [ fig : neuteffmass ] shows the density dependence of baryon effective masses , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as functions of the total baryon density @xmath72 .",
    "the background neutron densities are fixed here , so that variations in @xmath72 correspond to those in the fermi momentum of @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "since we ignore the chemical equilibrium here , curves of the effective masses have discontinuous jumps ; each piece corresponds to the fixed neutron densities , @xmath73 , @xmath5 , @xmath64 , and @xmath74 .",
    "consideration of the chemical equilibrium should connect them with each other .",
    "nevertheless , we obtain the values qualitatively similar to the ones shown in , for example , fig .  4 of ref .",
    "it is therefore concluded that in - medium property of the phenomenological @xmath0 interaction used in this study is justifiable .",
    "the effective mass of neutrons decreases steeply as the total baryon density increases , while mildly does the effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons due to the weaker coupling of @xmath1 hyperons to the scalar bosons than the coupling of nucleons .    for the channel",
    ", we use the rmf interaction as stated above .",
    "the interaction contains the dirac effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons , eq .  ,",
    "through which the medium effects are introduced ; the coupling of @xmath1 hyperons to @xmath22 bosons , to which nucleons also couple , brings about the dependence on the background density .",
    "figure  [ fig : mexint ] represents the @xmath0 rmf interaction derived from the parameter set hs - m2 .",
    "it is shown that increasing the background neutron density suppresses attractive contribution from low momenta .",
    "this is the main reason why the @xmath0 pairing gap is smaller in denser background .",
    "this new mechanism of the suppression is inherent in relativistic models which respect the lorentz structure as shown in eq .  .",
    "it is shown that the decrease of the effective baryon mass plays an indispensable role when it is used selfconsistently in the baryon spinor .",
    "what is important is that relativistic models naturally lead to a density - dependent interaction through a selfconsistent baryon spinor where the bare mass in a free spinor is replaced with the dirac effective mass .",
    "an apt example is the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter in the dbhf approach  @xcite .",
    "requirement of the selfconsistency for the nucleon spinor , that is , use of the dirac effective mass in the nucleon spinor effectively gives repulsion to the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "consequently , it pushes the saturation points predicted by nonrelativistic models toward the empirical one .",
    "it seems that our finding is similar to this repulsive effect .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism is apparently not restricted to @xmath0 pairs .",
    "it is probable that other kinds of _ yy _ pairs have the same trend .",
    "next we explore the effect of the nagara event on the @xmath0 pairing . with relation to the revised information on the @xmath0 interaction , we vary the ratio @xmath75 between 0.4 and 0.6 , referring to fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite : thereby we control the attractive component of the interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig:3dim ] represents the maximal @xmath0 pairing gap at the fermi surface of @xmath1 hyperons as a function of the strength of @xmath0 attraction and the background density of pure neutron matter . from this figure as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : neutgap ] , one reads that the suppression of the gap occurs in denser background of neutrons .",
    "moreover , it may even vanish in the end ( though the result depends on the choice of rmf parameter sets and a cutoff mass as will be shown later ) .",
    "this varying @xmath76 reveals likely closing of the gap at smaller @xmath76 ( _ i.e. _ weaker @xmath0 attraction ) and its strong suppression in the denser neutron background .",
    "this result implies that the aforementioned mechanism acts in concert with the weakened attraction for closing the gap .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 pairing correlation in dense pure neutron matter becomes less likely than before .",
    "the result is almost the same with the background of symmetric nuclear matter .    in the light of the neutron star cooling",
    ", the absence of the @xmath0 pairing might call for the pairing of other hyperonic species and a modification of its scenarios",
    ". more realistic approximation of the internal composition of neutron stars needs a condition of chemical equilibrium which plays a decisive role . under the condition",
    ", other hyperons will emerge as the background density increases .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath77 and @xmath78 pairings and shown their possibility  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of the @xmath0 pairing in neutron star matter with the concerted mechanism in this model stands unsettled due to complex composition of particles inside neutron stars .",
    "now we make a comparison between relativistic and nonrelativistic predictions . for the comparison with the nonrelativistic results of  @xcite  @xcite",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 pairing gap in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuclgap ] represents our result .",
    "slightly smaller gap than that obtained from the calculation of pure neutron matter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neutgap ] ) reflects the smaller dirac effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons in symmetric nuclear matter than that in pure neutron matter .",
    "we would like to note two remarkable differences between their result and ours .",
    "one difference is the dependence of the gap on the background density . strikingly , ours is opposite to theirs ( _ cf . _",
    "fig .  4 of ref .",
    "this is brought about _ directly _ and _ indirectly _ by decrease of the dirac effective mass .",
    "we intend by the word ` directly ' that we can grasp the decrease of the gap through an expression in the weak - coupling approximation , @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "equation   shows that the smaller the dirac effective mass becomes , the smaller the density of states does , which makes the gap smaller .",
    "note that we use the approximation for rough estimation here and the full integration of the gap equation   is done throughout the present study .",
    "meantime , we intend by the word ` indirectly ' that the gap decreases as the density increases due to gradual weakening of the attraction in the interaction which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mexint ] .",
    "the other difference is the region of the fermi momentum of @xmath1 hyperons where the gaps are open . while the regions in their result are similar in all densities presented , fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclgap ] shows that the regions in our result narrow as the background density increases .",
    "finally , the result at @xmath81 may have relevance to the @xmath0 pairing correlation around the center of hypernuclei  @xcite : we obtain the maximal gap @xmath82 mev .",
    "prior to the present study , @xcite studied  @xcite relativistic effects on the neutron and proton pairing in neutron star matter and made a comparison with a nonrelativistic result  @xcite .",
    "their result shows a large effect of `` minimal relativity ''  @xcite on the @xmath6 neutron pairing while a small one on the @xmath3 proton pairing .",
    "they explained that using dbhf single - particle energies and factors of the minimal relativity are the causes of much smaller neutron pairing gap .",
    "as for our model , the factor corresponding to the minimal relativity is already included in the interaction owing to the normalization of the dirac spinor , @xmath83 .      also noteworthy is a form factor : in this subsection , we investigate a dependence of the gap on the cutoff mass for each type of the form factor .",
    "we use the purely phenomenological form factor at each @xmath1 hyperon - meson vertex to regulate the high - momentum components of the interaction as in ref .",
    "we have chosen the bonn - type form factor , eq .",
    ", with the cutoff mass @xmath84 @xmath59 thus far in this paper .",
    "in contrast to the _ nn _ pairing , there has yet been no proper guide to determine the cutoff mass in the form factors for the @xmath0 pairing .",
    "we hence resort to borrow the value from our previous study of the _ nn _ pairing  @xcite .    however , the type of the form factor and the value of the cutoff mass significantly affect the magnitude of the pairing gap .",
    "we therefore calculate the dependence of the @xmath0 pairing gap at the fermi surface on the cutoff mass @xmath57 in the form factors of bonn - type , eq .  .",
    "the cutoff mass is taken to be larger than @xmath85 @xmath59 , which roughly corresponds to mass of the heaviest meson employed ( namely @xmath25 ) , otherwise the interaction is unphysical . the result is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cutoff - dep ] , in which the fermi momenta of @xmath1 hyperons are fixed to @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 @xmath59 for background density of pure neutron matter @xmath81 , @xmath64 , and @xmath74 , respectively . as expected , varying the cutoff mass changes the gaps steeply since it changes the balance of the attraction and the repulsion of the interaction .",
    "the peaks around @xmath89 @xmath59 are due to consecutive suppression of the attraction ( @xmath24 boson ) and the repulsion ( @xmath25 meson ) by the form factor .",
    "nonetheless , the importance of this result lies in the fact that the gaps become smaller in denser background for _ any _ cutoff mass .",
    "thus the arbitrariness does not alter our conclusions .    on the other hand , a form factor of monopole type , @xmath90 with moderate cutoff masses does not give a finite pairing gap in our model with the hs - m2 set ; using other rmf parameter sets",
    "may give finite gaps and their gentle dependence on the cutoff mass is expected in the manner similar to the _ nn _ pairing  @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that we do not intend to provide the optimal parameter sets for the description of @xmath0 pairing for the time being ; or rather we intend to present its general trend of density dependence within the present model irrespective of a given set of parameters .",
    "determining them precisely is inevitably deferred until the guide can be available .      before concluding the discussions , we present relevant issues for further study .",
    "we have employed pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter as background in this study .",
    "physics of neutron stars requires isospin asymmetricity of the background matter which should be considered in the next study . in connection with this",
    ", coherent and incoherent @xmath1-@xmath91 couplings should be mentioned .",
    "reference  @xcite argued that they are important to understand _",
    "s_-shell hypernuclei and , in particular , resolve the longstanding problem of overbinding in @xmath92he .",
    "furthermore , the coherent @xmath1-@xmath91 coupling predicts the coherent @xmath1-@xmath12 mixing in dense neutron - rich infinite matter  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath12 mixing shall come into play in asymmetric nuclear matter , which may change the critical density of hyperon emergence and eventually scenarios of the evolution of neutron stars .",
    "it is therefore important to introduce it into the models of dense hadronic matter . concerning relativistic models ,",
    "the introduction into both infinite and finite systems has been performed using the quantum hadrodynamics along with the concept of effective field theory  @xcite ; these works also show the importance of the mixing .",
    "on the other hand , the qcd sum rules predict that relatively weak mixing would be realized for @xmath1 and @xmath12 of the positive energy state while strong for the negative  @xcite .",
    "hence , room for argument over this issue still remains and the effect of the mixing on the pairing is unknown so far . in all cases ,",
    "we have ignored the mixing since it is beyond our scope of this study .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0 pairing in binary mixed matter of nucleons and @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "our theoretical framework is the rhb model combined with the rmf interaction both in the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels ; we have used it to naturally incorporate the medium effect into the latter , as well as the former , via the dirac effective mass of @xmath1 hyperons in the @xmath1 spinor .",
    "two noteworthy conclusions are thereby drawn .",
    "first , we have found that the value of the @xmath0 pairing gap decreases as the background nucleon density increases .",
    "this result is opposite to that reported in ref .",
    "it should be emphasized again that the origin of the medium effects is different from each other .",
    "second , in concert with the effect of increasing the background density , the weaker the @xmath0 attraction becomes , the more the @xmath0 pairing gap gets suppressed : the present model shows the possibility that it may disappear in the sequel .",
    "reluctantly , some arbitrariness of the form factors still remains since it has yet been virtually difficult to determine the cutoff mass precisely .",
    "the magnitudes of the @xmath0 pairing gap consequently remain uncertain because they have the strong dependence on the cutoff mass .",
    "we , however , have shown the essential result that the denser background reduces them gradually to be unchanged for different values of the cutoff mass . for transparency of the investigation ,",
    "we have ignored the chemical equilibrium .",
    "this should be considered in future .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge of the hyperon - hyperon interaction is somewhat limited at the moment .",
    "we notwithstanding expect that qualitative trends presented in this study will survive in more refined models , and also in pairing of another hyperonic species .",

    "<S> we calculate a @xmath0 pairing gap in binary mixed matter of nucleons and @xmath1 hyperons within the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model . </S>",
    "<S> lambda hyperons to be paired up are immersed in background nucleons in a normal state . </S>",
    "<S> the gap is calculated with a one - boson - exchange interaction obtained from a relativistic lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that at background density @xmath2 the @xmath0 pairing gap is very small , and that denser background makes it rapidly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests a mechanism , specific to mixed matter dealt with relativistic models , of its dependence on the nucleon density . </S>",
    "<S> an effect of weaker @xmath0 attraction on the gap is also examined in connection with revised information of the @xmath0 interaction . </S>"
