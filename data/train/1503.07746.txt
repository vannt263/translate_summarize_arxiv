    "there is a considerable interest to understand the gravitational dynamics of asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) space - times , stimulated to a large extent by the ads / cft correspondence , but independently of that , the problem is of sufficient inherent interest on its own @xcite . in the ground",
    "breaking work @xcite , the time - evolution of a free , massless scalar field coupled to einstein s gravity has been investigated in @xmath3 spatial dimensions in asymptotically ads space - times , with the result that from a large class of smooth initial data black holes form , indicating that ads is unstable . by now a large body of rather convincing numerical and perturbative evidence has accumulated that asymptotically ads space - times ( having the same conformal boundary that ads ) are in fact unstable with respect to black hole formation @xcite . the fact that arbitrarily small perturbations of an ads space - time lead generically to black hole formation is in sharp contradistinction to the minkowski or de sitter cases which are stable . the instability uncovered by ref .",
    "@xcite manifest itself by the fact that more and more energy gets concentrated in the same spatial region by weak turbulence .",
    "the existence of such an instability is clearly related to the peculiar causality structure of asymptotically ads space - times , which are not globally hyperbolic , ie .  there is no cauchy hypersurface in them . as a consequence ,",
    "the prescription of initial data on a space - like hypersurface in the usual way is not sufficient to uniquely determine its time evolution . in contradistinction to asymptotically flat or de sitter space - times one also has to specify suitable boundary conditions on the time - like conformal boundary of the asymptotically ads space - time at ( null and spatial ) infinity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that the same system , a minimally coupled , free , massless scalar field coupled to gravity , as in ref .",
    "@xcite admits spherically symmetric , time - periodic regular solutions ,",
    "whose mass is finite .",
    "such localized , time - periodic solutions shall be referred to as ads breathers . in ref .",
    "@xcite ads breathers have been constructed both by perturbative expansion and by direct numerical calculation , although , possibly because of the letter form of the paper , concrete results have been presented only for @xmath4 spacetime dimensions .",
    "both the perturbative and the direct numerical methods in @xcite are based on the expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of the linearized problem . in case of even spatial dimensions , to each order in the perturbative expansion , all metric and scalar field functions can be expressed as a sum of finite number of these terms .",
    "this does not hold for odd spatial dimensions , making the small - amplitude expansion formalism in @xcite not applicable in practice in that case .",
    "similarly , the presence of slowly decreasing coefficients in terms of the linearized solutions is likely to make the direct numerical method to determine the breather in @xcite impractical for even space dimensions .",
    "breather - type solutions are of obvious interest and it is a particularly important question to clarify their main properties , in particular their stability . in this paper we present a numerical construction of spherically symmetric ads breathers using the kadath library @xcite , on the one hand , and compute them analytically by a perturbative expansion in the amplitude , on the other hand .",
    "importantly , we also investigate the stability of the ads breathers using a time evolution code .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensional cases , but our methods work in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "our numerical construction of the ads breathers is based on deforming the well known linearized ads breathers @xcite having eigenfrequencies @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the node - number , whereby the amplitude of the solution becomes frequency dependent .",
    "we have mostly constructed breathers corresponding to the nodeless mode , @xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xcite gravitational geons",
    " localized , asymptotically ads vacuum solutions of the einstein equations with cosmological constant  have been calculated in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , scalar field ads breathers in @xmath8 dimensions have not been constructed numerically in the literature before . in case of @xmath4 dimensional spacetimes , careful comparison of our solutions with those of ref .",
    "@xcite shows very good agreement , providing rather nontrivial checks on the validity of both approaches .",
    "we note that even for @xmath4 dimensions our approach is able to provide significantly larger amplitude solutions than those presented in @xcite .",
    "the likely reason for this is the choice of the parameter @xmath9 in @xcite , which reaches a maximal value already before the amplitude of breather grows to the value where the mass is maximal .",
    "importantly , we have found that ads breathers whose frequencies lie between @xmath10 and @xmath0 , where @xmath11 for @xmath1 and @xmath12 for @xmath2 , are stable .",
    "the change of stability occurs where the mass of the ads breather is maximal , in analogy to what happens for boson stars @xcite .",
    "we also find a rather complicated resonance structure of the nodeless breathers both in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the amplitude of certain higher fourier modes of the scalar field increases abruptly .",
    "we have observed several such peaks , although here we only present numerical evidence for those which are easiest to find numerically .",
    "the detailed study of these resonances would require further extremely high precision numerical runs .",
    "however , the importance of their existence is reduced by the fact that apparently they all lie in the high amplitude unstable domain . the smallest frequency where our numerical code converges is around @xmath13 in @xmath1 and @xmath14 in @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of a minimal frequency for each @xmath0 and node number , @xmath15 is expected .",

    "[ s : evolution ] the numerical time evolution code is presented .",

    "we have performed the expansion up to fourth order , and excellent agreement with the numerical results have been found for as high values of the expansion parameter as @xmath16 .",
    "this strongly suggest that our perturbative expansion has a finite convergence radius .",
    "we consider @xmath17 dimensional einstein s equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath18 , @xmath19 where the stress - energy tensor is provided by a minimally coupled zero mass real klein - gordon scalar field @xmath20 , @xmath21 where all the greek indices are @xmath17-dimensional .",
    "the divergence of the einstein s equations yields the wave equation @xmath22 since for @xmath23 spatial dimensions both the einstein tensor and the energy momentum tensor is traceless , equation can only be satisfied for zero cosmological constant . hence in the following we assume @xmath24 .",

    "there are many possible choices of coordinates for the ads spacetime , and it is also the case for spacetimes that are only asymptotically ads . for the spectral methods applied in this section a natural choice is to apply isotropic coordinates . in those coordinates the @xmath17 dimensional ads metric reads [ e : met ] ds^2 = - ( ) ^2 dt^2 + ( ) ^2 ( dr^2 + r^2 d^2_d-1 ) , where @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the metric on the @xmath30 dimensional unit sphere .",

    "the metric can still be described by the form ( [ e : metdp1 ] ) . as we are interested in spherically symmetric and periodic solutions , the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend only on @xmath31 and @xmath40 .",

    "its expression comes from the kinematic definition of the extrinsic curvature tensor , which simply reads : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the d - dimensional spatial metric and @xmath46 the d - dimensional flat spatial metric .",
