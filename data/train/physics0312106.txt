    "to provide accurate quantum - electrodynamical ( qed ) evaluations of energy levels for two- and three - electron configurations of highly charged ions ( hci ) become now an urgent problem in atomic physics",
    ". this can be explained by the growing number of experimental data and the necessity to use the energy levels for the evaluation of important characteristics of hci , such as e.g. transition probabilities and recombination cross sections .    in the past",
    "an approximate relativistic approach based on variational non - relativistic wave functions has been used for evaluating energy levels @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical results for few - electron ions have been obtained within the framework of fully relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) and relativistic all - order many - body theory ( ao ) @xcite . however",
    ", rigorous qed results , which allow for a consequent order - by - order improvement of the accuracy of the calculations become more and more desirable .",
    "the approximation of non - interacting electrons is commonly employed as a zeroth - order approximation in qed perturbation theory for hci in the absence of a quasi - degeneracy of levels .",
    "accordingly , within the zeroth - order the energy of the few - electron configuration appears as the sum of the dirac eigenvalues for the occupied one - electron states .",
    "one - electron corrections ( termed here as generalized lamb shift ) include qed radiative corrections , such as the electron self energy ( se ) and vacuum polarization ( vp ) as well as nuclear corrections , i.e. , nuclear size ( ns ) , nuclear recoil ( nr ) and nuclear polarization ( np ) , respectively .",
    "few years ago a status report of one - electron energy corrections has been presented in detail in @xcite . since",
    "then considerable progress concerning the evaluation of higher - order self - energy corrections has been made @xcite .",
    "the dominant two - electron contribution is due to the interelectron interaction .",
    "ab initio qed results for the first - order interelectron interaction in two - electron ions are known from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the higher - order corrections are much more intricate .",
    "complete qed calculations of the second - order interelectron interaction have been accomplished for the ground state and for non - degenerate low - lying excited states of he - like and li - like ions @xcite .",
    "the other important two - electron corrections are the screened self - energy and vacuum - polarization corrections , which have been evaluated in @xcite for non - degenerate two- and three - electron configurations in hci .",
    "various general bound - state qed approaches have been employed for the derivation of the energy corrections in hci .",
    "the one most commonly used is the adiabatic s - matrix approach , developed by gell - mann and low @xcite , generalized by sucher @xcite and first applied to bound - state qed corrections in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the other one is the green s function approach , first developed in @xcite and now applied frequently in a more sophisticated form of the two - time green s function method @xcite .",
    "finally , the line profile approach ( lpa ) is utilized for the same purpose @xcite . in our previous studies on the qed theory of interelectron interaction in hci @xcite",
    "this approach has been applied .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the line profile approach to the case of quasi - degenerate electronic states in two - electron hci .",
    "this problem arises , when a complete qed treatment including the relativistic coupling scheme is applied to the fine - structure multiplets of systems with intermediate nuclear charge numbers @xmath4 .",
    "some components of the multiplet with equal relativistic quantum numbers turn out to be close enough to each other ( the @xmath0 , @xmath1 levels are the standard example ) .    up to now",
    "the qed theory of the quasi - degenerate levels was considered only within the two - time green s function method for the self - energy screening corrections ( without any numerical applications ) @xcite , for vacuum - polarization screening corrections @xcite and within the covariant evolution - operator procedure @xcite for the second - order interelectron interaction .",
    "numerical calculations for two - electron ions with @xmath5 @xcite are so far the only example where bound - state qed has been applied to the evaluation of the energy of quasi - degenerate levels taking into account the interelectron interaction up to second order .    in this work we present an extension of the line profile approach , which is suitable for the evaluation of energies of any number of the non - degenerate or quasi - degenerate levels .",
    "the interelectron interaction corrections up to first- and second - order of qed perturbation theory are evaluated for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 levels in a wide range of @xmath4 values .",
    "the problem of the natural line profile in atomic physics was considered first in terms of quantum mechanics by weisskopf and wigner @xcite . in terms of modern qed",
    "it was first formulated for one - electron atoms by low @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the appearance of the lorentz profile in the resonance approximation within the framework of qed was described and nonresonant corrections were estimated .",
    "later the line profile qed theory was modified also for two - electron atoms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and applied to the theory of overlapping resonances in two - electron hci @xcite . another application was devoted to the theory of nonresonant corrections @xcite .",
    "it was found in @xcite , that the lpa provides a convenient tool for calculating energy corrections .",
    "moreover , it clearly determines the limit up to which the concept of the energy of the excited states has a physical meaning ",
    "that is the resonance approximation .",
    "the exact theoretical values for the energy of the excited states defined , by the poles in the green s function , can be directly compared with measurable quantities only within the resonance approximation , where the line profile is described by the two parameters : energy @xmath8 and width @xmath9 . beyond this approximation",
    "the evaluation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be replaced by the evaluation of the line profile for the particular process . moreover , in the case of two - electron atoms the line profile approach was found to be very efficient for the evaluation of the reference state correction ( reducible part of feynman graphs ) for two - electron atoms @xcite .",
