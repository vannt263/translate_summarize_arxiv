    "recently , there is increasing evidence of the excess of the 130gev gamma - ray line from the galactic center ( gc ) in the four - year fermi data  @xcite .",
    "this may be interpreted as a signal of the dark matter ( dm ) , which annihilates or decays around the gc .",
    "an obstacle to construct a model of the annihilating / decaying dm which explains the observed gamma - ray line excess is that the branching ratio of the monochromatic photon production must be fairly large",
    ". it should be larger than around 0.01  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , continuum gamma - rays would hide the line gamma , and anti - protons may be overproduced .",
    "for instance , if the dm annihilation into photons takes place through loops of the standard model ( sm ) particles , it is difficult to realize such a large branching ratio  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a model of the decaying dm which naturally explains the gamma - ray line excess without producing too much continuum gammas and anti - protons . a supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "axion model  @xcite is considered to solve the strong cp problem in the framework of the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) .",
    "the axino , which is a fermionic superpartner of the axion , is a suitable candidate of the dm , if it is the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) . by introducing small r - parity violations",
    ", the axino decays into a photon plus a neutrino , and the fermi gamma - ray line excess can be explained .",
    "it is stressed that the branching fraction of the axino decay into monochromatic photons typically becomes @xmath7 , and the constraints from the overproductions of the continuum gamma - ray and the antiproton are satisfied .",
    "this is in contrast to the decaying gravitino dm scenario , where the branching fraction of the monochromatic photon production is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present scenario is cosmologically favored , because the lightest susy particle of the mssm ( mssm - lsp ) , e.g. , the lightest neutralino , decays by the r - parity violating effects before the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) begins .",
    "this avoids the cosmological problem associated with a late decay of the mssm - lsp when the gravitino is lighter than the mssm - lsp . on the other hand",
    ", the morphology of the gamma - ray line signature from the gc seems to favor the annihilating dm scenario rather than that of the decaying dm  @xcite .",
    "although relatively large gamma - ray signals are expected from the galactic halo in the decaying dm scenario , no such excesses have been observed .",
    "however , since there are potentially large uncertainties in the gamma - ray data and the dm density profile around the gc , it is premature to specify the dm model by the morphology  @xcite .    in the next section , the axino dm model will be introduced , and properties of the model will be explained , particularly paying attention to the r - parity violating effects .",
    "we consider the ksvz axion models  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the model can explain the gamma - ray line excess .",
    "in addition , several cosmological aspects will be discussed .",
    "the last section will be devoted to the conclusion and discussion .",
    "let us first introduce r - parity violations . in this letter , we consider a bilinear type of the r - parity violation  @xcite , which is characterized by the superpotential , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chiral superfields of the lepton doublet and the up - type higgs doublet , respectively .",

    "the down - type higgs superfield @xmath14 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the higgsino mass parameter appearing in the superpotential as @xmath19 , the r - parity violating superpotential ( [ w_bi ] ) is eliminated . hereafter , for notational simplicity , the primes on the redefined fields are omitted . after the redefinition ,",
    "the susy breaking potential becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a scalar component of the superfield @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent soft susy breaking parameters in the mssm , @xmath27 . due to the r - parity violating scalar potential ( [ lrpv ] ) ,",
    "sneutrinos obtain non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a ratio of the vevs of the up- and down - type higgs fields , @xmath30gev , and @xmath31 is a sneutrino mass .    before proceeding to discuss phenomenological aspects ,",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "it is possible to introduce the bilinear r - parity violating soft terms , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in addition to , before the field redefinition .",
    "the coefficients in then have additional contributions , but the following analysis will not be affected as far as the r - parity violation is parametrized by the the sneutrino vev .",
    "next , trilinear r - parity violating terms , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are also generated by the field redefinition .",
    "they are subdominant and will be ignored in the following study , because the terms are multiplied by the yukawa couplings .",
    "the sneutrino vevs ( [ nuvev ] ) induce mixings between the sm leptons and the gauginos . the sm neutrinos mix with the bino and the neutral wino , and the sm charged leptons mix with the charged winos .",
    "hence , the r - parity violating parameters are constrained .",
    "the neutrinos obtain masses of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a bino ( wino ) mass  @xcite . for gaugino masses of @xmath38gev , @xmath39",
    "is imposed to satisfy the experimental bound on the neutrino masses .",
    "also , the cosmological @xmath40 asymmetry is preserved for @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "other constraints are known to be weaker ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "as we will see , the size of the r - parity violation favored by the fermi gamma - ray line excess is much smaller as @xmath42 .",
    "the r - parity violation destabilizes the lsp . in this letter",

    "the relevant interaction terms of the axino are @xmath43\\tilde{b}b_{\\mu \\nu } + i \\frac{\\alpha_w c_w}{16 \\pi f_a }       \\bar{\\tilde{a}}\\gamma_5[\\gamma^{\\mu},\\gamma^{\\nu}]\\tilde{w}^aw^a_{\\mu \\nu }      \\label{ayy}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are model - dependent coupling constants of order unity , @xmath46 is the fine structure constant of u(1)@xmath47 , @xmath48 is that of su(2 ) , @xmath49 is the pq scale , @xmath50 denotes the axino , @xmath51 is the bino ( wino ) , and @xmath52 is the field strength of the u(1)@xmath47 ( su(2 ) ) gauge boson .",
    "the axino lsp is stable as long as the r - parity is conserved , whereas it decays via the operators with the gaugino mixings with the sm leptons , once the r - parity violation is turned on .",

    "the branching fractions are given by @xmath72 . from the above results ,",
    "the axino lifetime is estimated as @xmath73 where the r - parity violating parameter is defined as @xmath74 .",
    "the two - body decay of the axino into a photon contributes to the monochromatic gamma signal of the fermi observation .",
    "if the axino mass is around 260gev , the photon produced by @xmath75 has an energy of about 130gev . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed excess of the gamma - ray line is accounted for by a decaying dm , when its lifetime @xmath76 and the branching ratio @xmath77 are in the range of @xmath78sec and @xmath79 .",
    "the astrophysical constraints from the diffuse gamma - rays  @xcite and neutrinos  @xcite are also satisfied for such a parameter region . in the present model ,",
    "the branching ratio is around 0.8 for @xmath53 , while the hadronic branch from @xmath80 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus , the lifetime and the branching fraction which are required to explain the gamma - ray line excess from the gc are realized by the axino dm",

    "the second term in ( [ ayy ] ) provides interactions of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the decays , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , proceed by these interactions with the mixings of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the limit of @xmath90 , the decay rate of the axino into a photon and a neutrino",

    "the axion , which is a goldstone boson associated with the vevs of the pq scalars , has an anomaly - induced coupling to the gluon via pq quark loops , because the pq symmetry is anomalous under the qcd .",

    "radiative correction from the @xmath151 loops can also modify the axino mass  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we assume that these effects slightly reduce the axino mass , and the axino becomes the lsp .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss several cosmological constraints on the decaying axino dm scenario .",
    "let us assume that the lightest neutralino is mostly composed of the bino and that it is the mssm - lsp . in the presence of the r - parity violation , the bino decays into @xmath152 and @xmath153 due to the sneutrino vev .",

    "the bino also decays into the axino through the r - parity conserving operators ( [ ayy ] ) as @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
