    "we plan to deal with more general @xmath30 .",
    "for any two functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 defined on @xmath33 $ ] , we define the mellin convolution as follows : @xmath34 often we are interested in knowing when the convolution is a bounded function in the interval @xmath35 . to that purpose ,",
    "we introduce the following concept of the type for a function f. we say f is of type @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 if @xmath39 on @xmath35 , where @xmath40 is a constant depending on @xmath18 .",

    "further , if we know the number of @xmath50 that are equal to @xmath51 to be say @xmath52 , the estimate ( 1 ) can be improved to @xmath53 thus the log term will disappear if @xmath54 .",
    "most of the time our aim is to prove @xmath55 is bounded and the presence of log does not interfere with that aim since @xmath56 which makes @xmath47 bounded near zero and since @xmath57 , it is bounded near 1 . but log can not be avoided .",

    "one of our most useful tools in the following calculations will be the mellin transform .",

    "it is important and helpful to know that the mellin transform @xmath69 is uniquely determined by its values on any arithmetic sequence of integers .",
    "in fact we have the following classical theorem @xcite .    [ blk1 ]",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is a bounded analytic function on @xmath74 which vanishes at the pairwise distinct points @xmath75 , where    * @xmath76 + and * @xmath77 .",

    "* lemma 6 ,  p.1428 ) , gives us that there exists a constant @xmath40 such that @xmath111 basic observation is that the quotient of two gamma functions @xmath112 is a constant times the beta function @xmath113 moreover , according to our definition of the mellin transform , it turns out that @xmath114 is the mellin transform of @xmath115 which is of type @xmath116 . since the @xmath50 are smaller than @xmath117 respectively for @xmath110 ( in fact @xmath118 if and only if @xmath119 which is always true ) , equation ( [ equal ] ) implies that @xmath120 where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "since the product of mellin transforms equals to the mellin of the convolution product , we would have @xmath121 where @xmath55 is the convolution product of four functions of type @xmath116 , @xmath110 .",
    "now lemma a tells us that @xmath122 because @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 and hence @xmath55 is bounded function . therefore the function",
    "@xmath89 , if it exists , satisfies the equation @xmath125 for some constant @xmath40 , which is equivalent to @xmath126 now , by a change of variables @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath128 thus @xmath129 , and so @xmath89 is bounded .",

    "* lemma 6 ,  p.1428 ) , @xmath139 is constant times the quotient of @xmath140 gamma functions in the numerator and about the same in the denominator as follows : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "based on the same argument as in the previous subsection , we would like to write each quotient of two gamma functions as a constant times a beta function .",
    "in order to do that , we must assume that all @xmath150 and @xmath151 are positive for every @xmath152 and @xmath149 .",
    "moreover we observe that @xmath153",
    "so each quotient of two gamma functions in equation ( [ multigam])can be written as a constant times a beta function except those involving @xmath150 for @xmath148 .",
    "we fix this matter by noting that @xmath154 , and so here @xmath155 .",
    "hence , equation ( [ multigam ] ) becomes @xmath156 as in the previous subsection , this quotient of @xmath140 gamma functions on the numerator and the same in the denominator , respectively would be the mellin transform of the convolution product of @xmath140 functions .",
    "let us denoted it @xmath55 . by lemma",
    "a , we have @xmath157 where @xmath158 which is definitely positive , and @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 therefore we obtain @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a non - negative number . using lemma b , we see that @xmath55 has all derivatives of order not exceeding @xmath163 and they satisfy the inequality @xmath164 further the function @xmath89 , if it exists , would satisfy the equation @xmath165 now it is easy to check by integration by parts the following identity @xmath166 provided @xmath55 vanishes at 1 and @xmath167 is bounded in @xmath168 .",
    "thus in the current case , denoting @xmath169 by @xmath170 where @xmath171 , we can see @xmath172 and @xmath173 let us set @xmath174 which allows us to rewrite equation ( [ psi ] ) as @xmath175 now , by a change of variables @xmath127 , we obtain @xmath176 thus @xmath177 , and hence is bounded and the operator @xmath130 is a genuine toeplitz operator and @xmath27th root of @xmath87 .",

    "similar thing was discussed in @xcite but with less generality since the goal was different .",
    "let @xmath183 . by definition of the mellin convolution , it is easy to see that @xmath184 which after a change of variables @xmath185 and using the consequent identities @xmath186 leads to @xmath187 we have the following cases    * if @xmath188",

    "in this context we can assume that the function @xmath66 which is of type @xmath46 is @xmath220 the convolution product of these @xmath221 functions is defined by a repeated integral @xmath222 as in the case of two functions where we made a change of variables @xmath223 we make change of variables so that the new integral is over the unit cube @xmath224 where limits of integration do not depend on other variables .",
    "let @xmath225 and inductively define @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "now we make the change of variables as follows : @xmath228 so that the limits for each @xmath229 are @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "further we note @xmath232 let us set @xmath233 and @xmath234 it is easy to show , by induction on @xmath59 , that @xmath235 further @xmath236 thus @xmath237 but for @xmath238 , we have @xmath239 writing the product of functions in ( [ int ] ) in terms of @xmath229 , @xmath240 , @xmath206 , @xmath241 , for @xmath242 yields @xmath243 using equalities of @xmath244 , we calculate the differential form @xmath245 from @xmath246 and @xmath247 we derive @xmath248 let us assume that @xmath50 are arranged in decreasing order .",
    "then the product @xmath249 since @xmath250 .",
    "therefore @xmath251 here four cases have to be discussed .    *",
    "if @xmath252 . then @xmath253 * if @xmath254 and @xmath255 . then @xmath256 * if @xmath257 .",
    "choose an arbitrary @xmath258 and note that @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "therefore @xmath261 as we did in section 2 , this product of quotients of gamma functions is meromorphic on the interval @xmath262 $ ] except at zero where it has a pole of order @xmath263 , and so there exists a constant @xmath40 such that @xmath264 hence @xmath265 now * * if @xmath266 , then @xmath267 . in this case",

    "let @xmath275 be the convolution product of @xmath276 and @xmath277 be the convolution product of the rest namely @xmath278 . from the previous discussion it is clear that @xmath279 and @xmath280 denote by @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "the case @xmath54 has been treated previously .",
    "so assume @xmath284 .",
    "we see that @xmath285 now the change of variables @xmath286 leads to @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 noting that @xmath194 and @xmath291 and choosing an arbitrary @xmath197 implies @xmath292 let @xmath293 .",
    "this is the @xmath294th order derivative of the beta function @xmath295 as a function of @xmath202 , and @xmath295 is holomorphic on @xmath296 except at zero where it has a simple pole with residue 1 .",
    "this is easy to verify .",
    "so @xmath297 will be holomorphic on the interval @xmath296 . observing that @xmath298 is a linear sum of the derivatives of order less than or equal to @xmath299 of the beta function , we find @xmath300",
    "is bounded by a constant @xmath40 in the interval @xmath301 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath302 now arguing as in case 3 , if @xmath303 , we choose @xmath304 and get @xmath305 and if @xmath306 , we let @xmath307 , and have @xmath308 combining these two cases , we obtain @xmath309 this totally proves the lemma a.",
    "we recall ( [ h ] ) @xmath310 to make the differentiation easier , we introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath311 @xmath312 @xmath313 with this notation and the multi - index notation like for example @xmath314 , ( [ h ] ) can be written as @xmath315    clearly the function @xmath316 is summable @xmath317 , and each @xmath318 satisfies @xmath319 for @xmath207 .",
