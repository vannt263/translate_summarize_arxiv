    "what does this tell us about the source frame @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ? because the redshift dependence in the transformation from @xmath9-@xmath32 to @xmath0-@xmath1 is weak , the source frame correlation is likely to have the same origin as the observer frame relation ( section [ sec : anatomy ] ) .",
    "indeed , we observe a strong decrease in the source frame correlation significance when we account for the swift threshold .    finally , what can be learned about the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation as it appears in swift data relative to the pre - swift @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ?",
    "the normalization appears to be strongly instrument - dependent , and this suggests the pre - swift normalization is defined largely by pre - swift satellite flux limits .",
    "b07 find that the swift @xmath0-@xmath1 relation has a lower flux normalization and more scatter relative to pre - swift @xmath0-@xmath1 relations .",
    "we show above that we can raise this normalization ( and decrease the scatter about the relation ) to a level consistent with the pre - swift @xmath0-@xmath1 relation by imposing a heightened flux limit corresponding to detection by a satellite of hete-2-like sensitivity .    strictly speaking , from these observations we can only rule out the existence of a narrow relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while some physical correlation between the quantities may be present at high flux levels ( see , e.g. , the paucity of bright events in figure [ fig : epsbol]b ) . in any case ,",
    "future satellites more sensitive than swift are expected to further shift and broaden the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation into an inequality .    more strongly , because we can probably attribute the slope ( see , section [ sec : anatomy ] ) ,",
    "scatter , and normalization of the correlation to selection effects related to a photon flux @xmath5 cutoff and the functional correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath99 ( section 1 ; also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an intrinsic explanation for the correlation in the swift data may be unnecessary .",
    "our results also call into question any intrinsic explanation for the correlation in pre - swift data or in surveys only including the brightest swift events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because an @xmath0-@xmath1 relation should be instrument - independent .",
    "the existence of faint swift events ( in the observer frame ) mostly missing from pre - swift surveys shows that we have a poor understanding of the observational selection effects which truncate the earlier data ( see , also , * ? ? ?",
    ".    we could be incorrect in drawing these conclusions if : ( a ) our spectral fits are systematically incorrect and there are , in fact , no grbs at flux levels below hete-2 threshold levels , or ( b ) we have estimated the hete-2 threshold incorrectly by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "the accuracy of the spectral fits is addressed extensively in b07 , where direct consistency is established relative to observations from konus - wind or suzaku of bursts also detected by swift .",
    "we note that @xcite have independently verified the statistical analysis in b07 for several bursts also observed by rhessi .",
    "assumptions in b07 regarding the grb spectra ( see , section [ sec : hete ] ) , useful in compensating for the narrow bat bandpass when determining bolometric fluences , are conservative in that they err toward large @xmath14 values .",
    "it also seems unlikely that the hete-2 threshold should have any bearing on the censoring of swift grbs , considering also that many authors have reported batse grbs detected below hete-2 fluence limits @xcite .    for ( b )",
    ", we have shown that the @xmath32-@xmath9 correlation significance , after accounting for the hete-2 threshold , does not increase if we lower our threshold estimates by a factor of two . a larger error than this on our part for many grbs",
    "is extremely unlikely given the straight - forward nature of the threshold calculation ( section [ sec : hete ] ) .",
    "moreover , such a substantial increase in hete-2 sensitivity would make hete-2 as sensitive as swift , which is demonstrably incorrect given the dramatic difference in the grb localization rate of the two missions ( @xmath10120@xmath102yr for hete-2 and @xmath10190@xmath102yr for swift ) .",
    "given the mean peak photon flux to energy fluence ratio from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath103 @xmath9 ph s@xmath104 erg@xmath104 kev ) , our hete-2 threshold estimate is within 50% of that estimated in @xcite .",
    "finally , there is strong indication that flux limits associated with spectroscopic redshift determination are important to estimate and consider when restricting to grbs with measured redshift ( e.g , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : epsbol ] we mark the hete-2 events with measured redshift ; these are on average a factor two brighter relative to threshold than the events without measured redshifts .    the quality of the hete-2 grb localization and possibly also the brightness of the optical transient depend on the brightness of the grb ; both effects contribute to whether the afterglow and host galaxy can be detected .",
    "additional complicated selection effects related to determining the grb @xmath3 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "these are expected to be less important for swift due to arcsecond x - ray localizations .",
    "_ we stress that a correlation is not de facto intrinsic simply because trigger thresholding can be ruled out as influencing the surveys_. other flux limits may dominate ( and probably do dominate when the samples are restricted to grbs with measured redshift ) .",
    "a crucial step in utilizing pre - swift data to rule on the nature of correlations is to establish completeness in the surveys .      to gauge the importance of systematic effects in this area of research",
    ", we have isolated from the literature two paths that likely have lead to apparently highly significant correlations : ( 1 ) selection effects truncate the data in various ways and the `` missing '' data are not treated ; or ( 2 ) partial correlation with a hidden variable or variables is ignored . in this paper , we have studied type ( 1 ) errors . however , both type ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) errors can be unmasked using the tools outlined above .",
    "type ( 2 ) errors potentially arise in studies which employ one correlation ( e.g. , lag - luminosity , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to infer @xmath3 for another correlation with similar variables ( e.g. , @xmath0-luminosity ) , without controlling for partial correlation with the variable in common ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , from batse satellite observations where the detection threshold is very well characterized in terms of peak luminosity , we know that the @xmath0-luminosity correlation is largely formed in the detection process @xcite . however , this potential strong bias is ignored when @xcite consider a purely intrinsic @xmath0-luminosity to derive a significant evolution in the rest - frame properties of grbs ( e.g. , the correlation between luminosity and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the potential instrumental origin of the @xmath0-luminosity relation is also ignored by @xcite .",
    "we recommend testing potential new correlations ( or known correlations not explicitly mentioned here ) by proving :    1 .",
    "increase in rms scatter @xmath105 is statistically significant according to an f - test , and 2 .",
    "the correlation scatter or significance determined using outlier resistant measures strongly decreases when the @xmath3 s are randomized and the correlations are recalculated , and 3 .",
    "the observables , grouped to one side of the correlation equation , vary with @xmath3 as predicted .",
    "these tests are to establish basic confidence in an intrinsic nature for the correlations and are not merely to establish that a correlation can be used to estimate @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for these tests to be accurate , however , it is also necessary to identify selection effects acting on the data .",
    "flux or fluence values should be present down to the established survey completeness level .",
    "well - established methods can then be applied to compensate for data truncation ( section [ sec : hete ] ) and to control for partial correlations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "covariance between the measured quantities , if present , must also be treated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show above for grbs observed with multiple satellites that four example correlations reported in the literature have features ( instrument - dependent normalizations , weak @xmath3-dependence , etc . )",
    "indicative of strong contamination by or even an origin in selection effects .",
    "contrarily , there is no widely - accepted , non - a - posterior explanation for the correlations in the source frame .",
    "also , the a - posteriori theoretical explanations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fix the correlation normalizations by requiring grbs to have one intrinsic spectrum or to be standardizable candles ( e.g. , a narrow @xmath2 distribution ; see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a hypothesis no longer well - supported by the data ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the common @xmath3-independence of grb correlations is either very odd or damning . as we discuss , this is one characteristic of a tight , apparent source - frame correlation which arises purely due to selection effects . for correlations between luminosity and some other measured quantity that does not depend on luminosity distance ,",
    "@xmath3-independence is likely not a consequence of intrinsic physics , because the grb can not possibly know how the distance to the observer should vary with @xmath3 .",
    "however , @xmath3-independence might be expected for correlations between luminosities ( e.g. , the recently reviewed @xmath1-@xmath106 correlation , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that a requirement of @xmath3-independence trivially explains the relative slopes of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 relations ( section [ sec : anatomy ] ) , something theory can apparently do as well but only with reference to complicated biases stemming from grb beaming @xcite .    as an obvious point",
    ", we caution that the balancing of 1@xmath107@xmath3 terms on both sides of the correlation equations ( from which the approximate @xmath3-independence arises ) implies the correlations can not be used to infer @xmath3 . more speculatively  because redshift balancing allows a non - intrinsic observer - frame correlation to appear in the source frame as a low - scatter correlation  this balancing may have played a role in the discovery of potential intrinsic correlations .",
    "if the correlations currently known have been selected in place of correlations that do not balance redshift , and if the fitting of grb properties and the pruning of outliers has been conducted with these correlations in mind , then using these correlations to construct a hubble diagram and test concordance cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is circular .",
    "we stress that these redshift dependency problems  and our intrepetation of them  are unique to and potentially only characteristic of high-@xmath3 objects like grbs ( as opposed to , e.g. , sne ) where there is essentially no low-@xmath3 calibration , and luminosity distance must generally be calculated using @xmath3 and assuming a cosmology model .",
    "small sample sizes may also have played an important role in allowing for tight apparent correlations through over - fitting .",
    "the correlation involving luminosity , @xmath0 , and @xmath108 duration for 22 grbs in @xcite , which does not appear to suffer from redshift balancing ( see figure 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is an interesting case .",
    "when looking at larger datasets , however , there appears to be increased scatter and no statistically significant improvement in scatter relative to the @xmath0-luminosity @xcite or @xmath0-@xmath1 @xcite correlations .",
    "investigation of the correlations in the largest possible datasets is , therefore , critical .",
    "the grb community is no longer starved for data .",
    "the next critical step toward uncovering intrinsic correlations is to combine all available data by establishing sample completeness in pre - swift surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and treating the dominant flux truncations using methods like those outlined above .    in looking for new relations relevant to the physical processes underlying grbs , and to avoid an inherent difficulty in deciding an origin for the correlations in the source or observer frames ( section [ sec : anatomy ] ) , it may be important to choose observables less - broadly distributed than the characteristic range in 1@xmath107@xmath3 or to abandon observables with strong and complicated truncations ( i.e. , fluxes or fluences ) altogether .",
    "functional correlations in 1@xmath109 could be minimized by choosing observables ( e.g. , powerlaw indices ) which do not vary explicitly with @xmath3 .",
    "most directly and circumventing all concerns raised above , we should establish calibration for grbs at @xmath110 .",
    "it is , therefore , also crucial to understand whether grb properties evolve with redshift .",
