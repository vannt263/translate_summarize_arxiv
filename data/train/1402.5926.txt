    "in the dawn of quantum mechanics , erwin schrdinger @xcite was interested in establishing a connection between the new science and classical mechanics . with this interest in mind , he found quantum states with the right classical behavior in phase space @xcite .",
    "since these states can be used to examine the behavior of several systems at the border between quantum and semi - classical regimes @xcite , its study has taken an important place in quantum physics during the last fifty years .",

    "the standard cs are expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the normalized eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian with eigenvalues @xmath2 ( in dimensionless units ) and @xmath3 .",
    "let us note that several properties of the standard cs are used as definitions to construct the corresponding states for other quantum systems , namely :    * the cs are eigenstates of the annihilation operator , @xmath4 * they arise from applying the displacement operator @xmath5 onto the ground state @xmath6 , @xmath7 * those states satisfy the minimum heisenberg uncertainty relation for the position and momentum operators , @xmath8 * they allow to decompose the identity operator in the way @xmath9    in this paper we will find sets of cs for what we will call _ painlev iv hamiltonian systems _ , which are special families of @xmath10th order susy partners of the harmonic oscillator having associated always third - order differential ladder operators @xmath11 and , consequently , being related with the painlev iv equation @xcite .",
    "we will call them _ painlev iv coherent states _ ( pivcs ) . moreover , due to the action of @xmath11 onto the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , the hilbert space @xmath12 is naturally expressed as the direct sum of two subspaces : one of infinite dimension , related with the semi - infinite ladder arising from the original levels of the harmonic oscillator , and another one of finite dimension , associated with the new levels created by the susy transformation .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ pha and piv ] , the connection between an interesting class of quantum systems and the painlev iv equation will be established .",
    "the next section concerns with susy qm and the way to generate painlev iv hamiltonians systems , along with their corresponding third - order ladder operators . in section [ pivcs ] ,",
    "several sets of coherent states for the aforementioned systems are generated , inside the finite and infinite subspaces .",
    "our conclusions shall be presented in the last section .",

    "this second order nonlinear differential equation is known as painlev iv equation .",
    "it is worth to note that the six painlev equations are second order nonlinear differential equations with the painlev properties , which in recent times have been studied in detail @xcite .    as can be seen , if one solution @xmath37 of the painlev iv equation is obtained for certain values of @xmath40 , then the potential @xmath41 as well as the corresponding ladder operators @xmath42 become completely determined .",

    "the 1-susy partners of the harmonic oscillator can be used directly to find solutions to the painlev iv equation , since their natural ladder operators @xmath133 are of third order and thus they generate a second order polynomial heisenberg algebra . moreover",

    "in addition , the transformation functions are no longer arbitrary : once the first one is chosen , all the others are automatically fixed by the theorem . as a result ,",
    "the only parameters that remain free are now : the number of levels @xmath10 to be inserted , the energy gap @xmath146 between the two ladders ( under the restriction @xmath147 ) , and the real parameter @xmath148 of the transformation function @xmath136 ( such that @xmath138 ) .     on the eigenstates of the hamiltonians @xmath149 .",
