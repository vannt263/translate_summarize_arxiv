    "gamma ray burst ( grb ) emission originates from plasma which expands relativistically from initial optically thick phase .",
    "it necessarily contains the photospheric component which appears when plasma becomes transparent to radiation initially trapped in it @xcite .",
    "the fireshell model , see .",
    "e.g. @xcite pays special attention to this photospheric component .",
    "it is identified as p - grb ( proper grb ) .",
    "both its energetics and time separation from the peak of the afterglow are predicted , and comparison with observations allowed identification of this component in many grbs ( 970228 , 991216 , 031203 , 050315 , 050509b , 060218 , 060607a , 060614 , 071227 , 090618 , 090902b , 090423 and others ) .    the impossibility of explaining observed hard low energy slopes of spectra with traditional synchrotron shock models revived the interest in the photospheric emission from relativistic outflows in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "reprocessing of thermal emission assumed to originate from the photosphere by nonthermal distribution of electrons is in the basis of more complicated models with dissipation near the photosphere .",
    "such models successfully reproduce both high energy and low energy parts of observed spectra in some bursts : e.g. grb090902b , see @xcite .",
    "however , the physics of dissipation is poorly understood .",
    "fine tuning is involved , since such dissipation is required to occur very near the photosphere , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "several papers claim deviations of theoretically computed spectrum , coming from nondissipative photospheres of relativistic outflows , from the planck shape at low energies .",
    "@xcite found the low energy photon index @xmath2  ( in contrast with @xmath3 for planck spectrum ) solving the radiative transfer equations by monte carlo method in the steady relativistic wind . @xcite and @xcite found both analytically and numerically flattening of the spectrum , considering late time emission from the relativistic wind when it switches off with @xmath4 for late emission .",
    "this result is obtained considering the probability density function of the last scattering .",
    "@xcite found that the increased power at low energies with respect to the planck spectrum ( photon indices are , respectively @xmath5 and @xmath6 for accelerating and coasting photon thick instantaneous spectra ) is the result of temperature distribution across the photospheric equitemporal surface ( eqts ) .",
    "the formation of photon spectrum at the photosphere of ultrarelativistically expanding outflow can be explained as a combination of several effects .",
    "firstly , there is a contribution from different angles with respect to the line of sight of photons , arriving to the observer at the same time from the eqts .",
    "this effect is purely geometrical .",
    "secondly , photons have different comoving temperatures at each point of eqts and the observed spectrum is a superposition of that comoving spectra , blueshifted to the observer s reference frame ( a multicolor blackbody ) @xcite .",
    "thirdly , local spectral distortions arise due to the decoupling of photons from the plasma near the photosphere . in this letter",
    "we are concerned with the latter effect .",
    "we use the radiative transfer equation for the steady wind model of @xcite with collision integrals obtained as the fokker - planck approximation to exact collision integrals of compton scattering .",
    "this equation reduces to the classic kompaneets equation for the medium at rest",
    ". however , here we consider relativistically expanding outflow , implying that anisotropy of the photon field has to be accounted for in the collision integral .",
    "we solve numerically this equation and find the observed spectrum of photospheric emission from relativistic wind .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the radiative transfer equation for coasting relativistic wind . in section 3",
    "we report our numerical results .",
    "conclusions follow .",

    "our scheme for the classical kompaneets equation is similar to the one used in @xcite . in numerical calculations",

    "the electron comoving density decreases with increasing laboratory radius , so does the optical depth .",

    "electrons are described by the maxwellian distribution function in the comoving frame with the temperature given by the relation ( [ scalings ] ) .    since",
    "initially the outflow is highly opaque , photons in the beginning have thermal spectrum and isotropic distribution in the comoving reference frame . near the photosphere",
    "the coupling of photons to the medium is due to compton scattering on electrons .    before proceeding with steady wind model",
    ", we tested our numerical scheme . considering",
    "a uniform optically thick medium with stimulated emission taken into account and neglected , respectively , convergence to planck and wien distributions of photons has been verified .",
    "the anisotropy of photon distribution near the photosphere in comoving reference frame found by @xcite is an interesting effect which we have also found in our approach .",
    "this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ anisotropy ] .    this effect can be explained from the geometric point of view .  since collisions tend to isotropize photons , only those photons which are undergoing scatterings have nearly isotropic distribution .",
    "in contrast photons that already experienced their last scattering have increasingly anisotropic distribution in the comoving frame due to relativistic aberration . hence the local photon field at the photosphere which contains all photons ,",
    "those which continue to scatter and those which already propagate freely , becomes more and more anisotropic .     with increasing anisotropy.,width=316 ]    our computation is performed in the comoving reference frame .",
    "in order to find the photon spectrum which a distant observer will detect we have to transform the spectrum into the laboratory reference frame . one has to use the following transformations @xmath46 where the subscript `` @xmath37 '' denotes quantities in the laboratory frame .",
    "two asymptotic cases were found in @xcite to have very different spectra from the photosphere :  photon thick and photon thin ones .",

    "[ comsp ] we show the evolution of photon spectrum in comoving reference frame for selected values of radii starting at large optical depth through the photosphere ending up at small optical depth @xmath61 .",
    "while the spectrum in comoving frame initially keeps the planck shape , it becomes distorted with decreasing optical depth .",
    "it is also the consequence of interaction with electrons which on average have smaller energy than photons do , see fig .",

    "we also computed observed spectrum with different values of @xmath43 parameter .",
    "the values of @xmath66 imply that the temperature in the wind decreases with radius faster than the one given by the steady solution .",
    "more rapid change of temperature with radius may mimic some more realistic profiles of finite radial extension of the outflow , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "photons propagating in such outflows scatter on electrons with lower temperature , which leads to additional comptonization of the spectrum . at large optical depths photon spectrum",

    "[ spectra ] we show for comparison two final observed spectra @xmath68 with different values of @xmath43 , namely @xmath44 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the number of photons in the low energy part of the spectrum increases with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "this low energy part of the spectrum can be fit with a power law . performing the fit in the energy range between 1 and 10 kev we found that the power law index changes as follows @xmath69 this power law index @xmath70 actually coincides with the one used in the band phenomenological spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus we find that compton scattering near the photosphere can change the low energy part of observed spectrum .",
    "in particular , the photon index @xmath70 is shown to depend on the index @xmath43 which parametrizes the electron temperature dependence on radius .    in our calculations the stationary wind model is used .",
    "the observed durations of grbs range from a fraction of second to thousands of seconds , hence the finite duration effects have to be taken into account for theoretical calculations of light curves and spectra of the photospheric emission .",
    "such finite duration effects give rise to a new classification of relativistic outflows , which is discussed in details by @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "besides one has to keep in mind that the prompt emission of grbs contains not only photospheric component but in most cases also non - thermal component originating from optically thin regions of the outflow",
    ". however , unambiguous identification of the photospheric component in grbs is crucial since it provides basic information about the physical parameters of grbs , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we considered relativistic steady wind and computed the observed spectrum of its photospheric emission . for this goal we solved the equation of radiative transfer in comoving reference frame with exact compton collision term in fokker - planck approximation , including the effect of anisotropy of the photon field .",
    "we obtained the photon spectra in the laboratory frame , as seen by a distant observer .",
    "we confirmed the result of @xcite indicating the presence of strong anisotropy developed in the comoving frame at the photosphere .",
    "some qualitative differences in our results are due to the fact that he used approximate collision term , instead of our exact one .",
    "the observed spectrum from the photosphere of the steady coasting relativistic wind is found in agreement with previous studies .",
    "we also found that when the temperature decreases with radius faster than in the case of a steady wind the low energy part of the observed spectrum changes significantly with respect to the planck function .",
