    "galaxy surveys have allowed us to study the large scale structure in the local universe .",
    "large clusters of galaxies and voids have been detected in these surveys and they have placed constraints on cosmological parameters and models of structure formation . however , large area ( @xmath11 deg@xmath12 ) , galaxy redshift surveys have so far only probed clustering out to @xmath13 . even the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless 1998 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( gunn & weinberg 1999 ) will only observe galaxies with redshifts @xmath14 .",
    "surveys such as the canada - france redshift survey ( crampton et al . 1995 ) and the cnoc survey ( yee et al . 2000 ) have probed galaxy clustering out past @xmath15 and , in the future , the deep ( davis & faber 1998 ) and virmos ( le fvre et al .",
    "1998 ) surveys will probe galaxy clustering out past @xmath16 .",
    "steidel and collaborators have even developed techniques from which galaxies can be selected at higher redshifts by looking for the lyman break ( steidel et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "however these deep surveys currently only cover a small area of sky and the resulting ` pencil beams ' are unsuitable for direct power spectrum measurements . if we wish to measure the power spectrum of clustering out to high redshifts over a wide area in a reasonably short time period , then different techniques or a different class of object are required .",
    "since the work of osmer ( 1981 ) , redshift surveys of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) have been used to probe clustering at high redshifts .",
    "the initial attempts to measure qso clustering proved inconclusive , due to the low number density of qsos and the inhomogeneous nature of the surveys .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in the mid-1980 s that qsos are clustered , at least on small @xmath17mpc scales , and that the amplitude of qso clustering is similar to that of present day , optically selected galaxies ( shaver 1984 , shanks et al .",
    "1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "more recently , several groups have looked at the evolution of qso clustering .",
    "croom & shanks ( 1996 ) found that the amplitude of qso clustering remains approximately constant with redshift , whereas la franca , andreani & cristiani ( 1998 ) found that the clustering amplitude of optically bright qsos evolves slowly with redshift , such that the clustering amplitude of high redshift qsos is 2@xmath18 higher than that of low redshift qsos .",
    "however , existing surveys of qsos are still fairly small , for example , the durham / aat survey ( boyle 1986 ) contains @xmath19 qsos and large bright qso survey ( hewitt , foltz & chaffee 1995 ) contains 1,053 qsos .",
    "measurements of some clustering statistics have been hampered by the small number of objects contained in the survey or the limited sky coverage of the surveys .",
    "our knowledge of the structure of the universe at high redshifts will be drastically improved once the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz , croom et al .",
    "1998 ; boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; croom et al . 2001 ) and the qso part of the sloan digital sky survey ( gunn & weinberg 1995 ) are finished .",
    "these surveys will contain at least a factor of 25 more qsos and cover a larger area of sky than existing qso surveys .",
    "one of the key aims of both surveys is to measure the clustering of qsos out to @xmath20mpc with greater accuracy than is possible with existing surveys .",
    "for example , the increased number of qsos in the 2df qso survey should reduce the errors on the measured correlation function by at least a factor of 5 on scales @xmath21mpc ( croom et al .",
    "2001 )    the power spectrum is now established as one of the favoured methods of quantifying clustering .",
    "( baugh & efstathiou 1994 ; tadros & efstathiou 1996 ; lin et al .",
    "1996 ; hoyle et al .",
    "one advantage of the power spectrum over the two - point correlation function is that the two - point correlation function is affected by uncertainties in the mean density on all scales , whereas the power spectrum is only affected by these uncertainties on the largest scales ( cole , fisher & weinberg 1995 ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to measure the power spectrum of the mass density field , as this is the statistic predicted by models of structure formation .",
    "however , we are only able to observe the light in the universe . therefore , we generally measure the power spectrum of objects such as galaxies , clusters and qsos , although there are promising methods for measuring the mass power spectrum from lyman alpha forest systems ( croft et al .",
    "1998 ) and from weak lensing ( wilson , kaiser & luppino 2001 ) .",
    "however , if the bias is scale independent , then although the amplitude of the qso power spectrum may be different to that of the mass , the form of the qso power spectrum will directly probe the shape of the mass power spectrum ; the assumption of scale independent bias may be more appropriate at large scales ( coles 1993 ; mann , peacock & heavens 1998 ) .",
    "the power spectrum has never before been measured from optically selected qsos .",
    "qsos are detected out to high redshifts and so qso surveys have a large volume .",
    "however , existing surveys only cover small areas of sky and contain only a small number of qsos .",
    "the survey geometry and low qso number density within the surveys would have severely restricted the range of scales over which the power spectrum could have been reliably measured .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a power spectrum analysis to the 10k release catalogue .",
    "a correlation function analysis of the identical sample has been performed by croom et al .",
    "we describe the current data set in section [ sec : qsodata ] and look at the angular distribution of the qsos in order to create the random catalogues needed in the power spectrum analysis . in section [ sec : pkqso ] we briefly describe the method of power spectrum analysis and in section [ sec : test ] we test the measurement of the power spectrum from the current survey window using mock catalogues drawn from the virgo consortiums _ hubble volume _ lightcone simulation ( frenk et al . 2000 ) . in section [ sec : qsoreslts ] we compare the qso power spectrum to power spectra of present day galaxies and clusters and we see how the qso power spectrum evolves with redshift . in section [ sec : qsoimp ] we compare the qso power spectrum with power spectra of models of large scale structure and in section [ sec : qsoconc ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we analyse qsos that will be contained in the first public release of the 2qz , known as the _ 10k catalogue_. the catalogue will contain 10681 qsos and will be released to the community in the first half of 2001 .",
    "this catalogue will contain the most spectroscopically complete fields ( i.e. fields in which more than 85 per cent of objects have been identified ) that were observed prior to november 2000 .",
    "it will eventually be available from www.2dfquasar.org .",
    "qso candidates are identified from broad band _",
    "ub@xmath22r _ colours from automatic plate measuring ( apm ) facility measurements of uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) photographic plates .",
    "this colour selection gives a photometric completeness of better that 90 per cent up to @xmath23 ( boyle et al .",
    "the spectra of the objects are obtained using the 2df instrument on the aat .",
    "the spectra are reduced using the 2df pipeline reduction system ( bailey & glazebrook 1999 ) and objects are identified as qsos by an automated procedure known as autoz ( miller et al .",
    "autoz also identifies the qso redshifts ; these have also been visually checked by two independent observers .",
    "observations have been made over two 5@xmath2475 deg@xmath12 strips in the north and south galactic cap regions .",
    "the north galactic cap strip is centred at @xmath25 with 09@xmath2650@xmath27 @xmath28 14@xmath2650@xmath27 , while the south galactic cap strip is centred at @xmath29 , with 21@xmath2640@xmath27 @xmath28 03@xmath2615@xmath27",
    ". we will refer to these regions as the ngc and sgc respectively .",
    "the finished survey will cover an area of 740 deg@xmath12 . see croom ( 1997 ) , smith ( 1998 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for further details of the photometric catalogue .",
    "for each qso , we have an angular position and a redshift . in order to convert from a redshift into a comoving distance",
    ", we need to adopt a cosmology .",
    "we consider an @xmath3=1.0 , @xmath30=0.0 cosmology ( eds hereafter ) and an @xmath3=0.3 , @xmath30=0.7 cosmology ( referred to as the @xmath5 cosmology hereafter ) .",
    "other cosmologies , such as open cosmologies , could also be considered but here we restrict our analysis to flat cosmologies , consistent with the recent results from balloon experiments such as boomerang ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) and maxima ( balbi et al . 2000 ) .        [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in figure [ fig : models ]",
    ", we show the qso power spectrum with the eds cosmology ( open circles , a ) and with the @xmath5 cosmology ( solid circles , b ) .",
    "the lines have different values of @xmath8 : @xmath8=0.5 ( solid ) , @xmath8=0.4 ( short - long dashed ) , @xmath8=0.3 ( short dashed ) , @xmath8=0.2 ( long dashed ) and @xmath8=0.1 ( dotted ) .",
    "models with @xmath8=0.5 are ruled out at more than 3@xmath18 assuming either cosmology .",
    "this is in agreement with results from galaxy surveys .",
    "more large scale power was found in the galaxy correlation function from the apm survey than expected from the standard cdm @xmath8=0.5 model ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ) .",
    "this led to variants of the cdm model , such as @xmath5cdm and @xmath31cdm to be developed .    in both cases ,",
    "the best agreement between the models and the qso power spectra is found with a model with low values of @xmath8 .",
    "models with @xmath8=0.12@xmath320.10 best fit the shape of the qso power spectrum assuming the eds cosmology and models with lower values of @xmath33 best fit the qso power spectrum assuming the @xmath5 cosmology .",
    "the input power spectrum to the @xmath5cdm _ hubble volume _ has a shape of @xmath8=0.17 .",
    "this model is therefore consistent with the data at the 1@xmath18 level .",
    "the results found here are in reasonable agreement with those of croom et al .",
    "they find that models with @xmath8=0.5 do not provide a good fit to the correlation function measured from the 10k qso catalogue assuming the eds and the @xmath5 cosmology .",
    "models with @xmath8=0.1 - 0.2 are required to fit the correlation function with the @xmath5 cosmology assumed .",
    "however , models with @xmath8=0.2 - 0.4 best fit the correlation function if the eds cosmology is assumed .",
    "this test is quite simplistic as possible effects of the incompleteness have not been included in the shape of the model power spectrum , although by fitting to a limited range of scales we should have reduced the effect that this can have on the models that fit the power spectrum .",
    "when 2qz is finished , we will be able to compare the models over a wider range of scales and produce stronger constraints on the range of acceptable @xmath8 parameters .    in order to thoroughly test models of structure formation , full n - body simulations , such as the _ hubble volume _ are required . however , due to the large volume of 2qz , large amounts of super - computing time are required to carry out such simulations so it is currently not possible to run them for a wide range of cosmological models .",
    "physically motivated models for selecting qsos within the simulation are also required as a linear bias between the mass and the qsos may be an over simplification , even on these large scales .",
    "we have presented the first qso power spectrum analysis using the 10k catalogue from the 2df qso redshift survey . the qso power spectrum has a power law form with p@xmath34 which appears to extend to large scales .",
    "more large scale power is seen in the qso power spectra than in the apm power galaxy spectrum even .",
    "the clustering environment observed for radio - quiet qsos in ccd imaging experiments is close to that of optically selected galaxies , ( ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; smith , boyle & maddox 1995 , 1999 ; croom & shanks 1999 ) suggesting that the biasing of qsos may be no stronger than it is for galaxies ; at the r@xmath3550h@xmath0mpc scales considered here the assumption that the qso - mass bias is scale independent may therefore be reasonable .",
    "therefore , the fact that we do not see a turnover on scales up to 300@xmath36mpc places a strong constraint on the value of the shape parameter , requiring @xmath37 .",
    "we find that the large scale power seen in the qso power spectrum is best fit by cdm models with @xmath8 as low as @xmath38 .",
    "a power spectrum analysis of mock qso catalogues , created from the virgo consortium s hubble volume @xmath5cdm simulation , with @xmath10 as input , produces a result which is statistically consistent with the data .",
    "the analysis of the mock catalogues indicates that we are able to produce a first robust measurement of the qso power spectrum over a wide range of scales and thus the above results for @xmath8 are unlikely to be dominated by systematic effects due to the current incompleteness of the 2qz catalogue .",
    "we note that the low @xmath8 values measured here from the shapes of the qso power spectra are in some disagreement with the best fit parameters as measured from the boomerang and maxima cmb power spectra ( balbi 2000 , de bernadis 2000 ) .",
    "bond et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measures @xmath39=0.03 and @xmath40=0.17 for @xmath41=0.2 in a spatially flat model .",
    "for h=0.65 this implies @xmath42 which is rejected at 2@xmath18 in figures [ fig : models](a , b ) .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this discrepancy persists as more cmb and 2qz data accumulate .",
    "we measure the qso power spectrum in two bins of redshift and find that the clustering can only evolve slowly as a function of redshift as qsos with a median redshift of @xmath43=1.0 have a clustering amplitude consistent with that of qsos with a median redshift of @xmath43=1.8 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of croom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who find little evolution in the amplitude of qso clustering as a function of redshift if the eds cosmology is assumed and only slow evolution if a @xmath5 cosmology is assumed .",
    "the qso power spectrum , which is therefore broadly independent of redshift , lies close in amplitude to the power - spectrum of local , optically selected galaxies .",
    "the range of scales where the two overlap is limited , but once the 2df galaxy redshift survey is finished , an interesting comparison between power spectra of optically selected qsos and galaxies over a wide range of scales will be possible .",
    "the power spectrum of rich galaxy clusters measured by tadros , efstathiou & dalton ( 1998 ) has a far higher clustering amplitude than the qso power spectrum , again suggesting that the qso - mass bias is much closer to galaxies than galaxy clusters .",
    "we tentatively detect a ` spike ' feature at @xmath44mpc assuming the @xmath5 cosmology or @xmath45mpc assuming the eds cosmology .",
    "this feature appears to reproduce in both the ngc and sgc strips and in independent redshift bins but its statistical significance is still marginal .",
    "an investigation using cmbfast indicates that the spike is seen at a @xmath4625 per cent smaller wavenumber than the second peak caused by acoustic oscillation in the pre - recombination baryon - radiation fluid .",
    "somewhat higher values of @xmath47 than usually assumed in @xmath5cdm models may also be needed to fit the amplitude of the feature .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this feature persists in the final 25k 2qz survey p(k ) .",
    "since it lies well into the linear regime where it will evolve little with redshift under the correct assumed cosmology it could therefore act as an important probe of world models .",
    "the qso power spectrum is currently measured to an accuracy of @xmath48% over the range of scales 60@xmath49mpc for either the eds or @xmath5 cosmology adopted here . on these scales",
    ", we predict the errors will be approximately 1.5 times smaller in the completed 2qz catalogue .",
    "the power spectrum from the 25k catalogue will also be measurable out to scales of @xmath50mpc .",
    "thus , when these data become available , there is the promise of placing even stronger constraints on the large scale structure of the universe and hence on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "we would like to recognise the considerable efforts of all the aat staff responsible for the operation of the 2df instrument which has made this survey possible .",
    "we would also thank our colleagues on the 2df galaxy redshift survey team , in particular gavin dalton and steve maddox , for facilitating many of the survey observations and john peacock and shaun cole for useful comments .",
    "we also thank the virgo consortium , especially adrian jenkins and gus evrard , for providing the _ hubble volume _ simulations .",
