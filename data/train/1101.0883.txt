    "ion waves are one of the most prominent features of ionized environments with abundant occurrence in astrophysical entities and laboratory plasmas .",
    "the characterization of such waves began early in 1961 by work of vedenov et.al @xcite using pseudo - potential method .",
    "another approach which is widely employed to investigate the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear excitations is the so - called reductive perturbation technique @xcite .",
    "however , the later approach is suitable only for the study of small - amplitude nonlinear perturbations and is usually applied for treatment of plasma waves in a state very close to thermodynamic equilibrium . in order to achieve satisfactory results applicable to real environments using perturbation method , it is needed to consider the higher - order approximations for dependent plasma variables @xcite . in recent years there has been many investigations on arbitrary - amplitude nonlinear ion solitary ( isws ) , ion periodic ( ipws ) as well as electrostatic solitary waves ( esws ) in different plasma environments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the small amplitude propagation as well as interaction of isws has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in magnetized pair plasmas with the electrons and positrons possessing either non - relativistic or ultra - relativistic degeneracy pressure .",
    "it is however the aim of current work to study the propagation of ion waves in dense plasmas with arbitrary degree of relativistic degeneracy in three component electron - positron - ion dense plasmas .",
    "because of accommodation of variety of nonlinear excitations in pair plasmas with components of equal mass and charge , and also because of their inevitable applications in astrophysics , the electron - positron - ion plasma has attracted outstanding attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "for instance , electron - positron - ion plasmas exist in active galactic nuclei @xcite , pulsar magnetospheres @xcite and many dense astronomical objects like neutron stars and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that the electron - positron - ion plasma may play an important role in the beginning and evolution of universe @xcite .",
    "pair plasmas have been produced and studied in laboratory @xcite .",
    "the electron - positron - ion plasma can also be easily confined in a tokamak @xcite .",
    "calculations @xcite reveal that even in dense electron - positron - ion plasmas ion waves can have significant lifetime to propagate in such environments , despite the high rate of annihilation processes .    on the other hand , in compact dense astrophysical objects @xcite and in ordinary metals and semiconductors @xcite ,",
    "fermion constituents of plasma are under extreme condition called the degeneracy state . in a degenerated plasma",
    "the quantum and relativistic effects become important and the much higher degeneracy pressure which arises due to the pauli - exclusion mechanism should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the quantum effects become more important , specifically , when the inter - particle distances become less than the characteristic de broglie thermal wavelength , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite , using the fermi - dirac statistics for electrons , has given a mathematical criteria under which a white dwarf can be considered as completely degenerate .",
    "in the zero - temperature fermi - gas , used for a completely degenerate plasma , it is assumed that the thermal temperature of plasma species are , although finite , but fall much below the well defined characteristic fermi - temperature @xcite .",
    "although , the zero - temperature model may seem a simplifying assumption , however , it hold for many dense astrophysical entities such as white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that to have a more realistic model accounting for the electron / positron temperature , one has to revisit the finite temperature fermi - dirac model which can be our future work .",
    "it has been shown that , the electron degeneracy in massive white dwarfs which opposes the catastrophic gravitational inward pressure may give rise to softened relativistic degeneracy pressure leading to the ultimate collapse of massive star in some conditions @xcite .",
    "there are some studies , using quantum hydrodynamics , which deal with astrophysical models considering only the non - relativistic electron degeneracy case @xcite .",
    "whereas , in a typical white dwarf with the electron density as high as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , the degeneracy pressure is extreme and both quantum and relativistic considerations have to be invoked . application of semiclassical thomas - fermi approximation indicates that the dynamics of nonlinear ion excitations in the electron - positron - ion plasma can be quite different when the electrons / positrons are under ultra - relativistic degeneracy pressure from that under normal degeneracy pressure @xcite .",
    "previously reported investigations , based on the quantum hydrodynamics model @xcite , consider normal degeneracy case encountered in ordinary metals and semiconductors . in this study , we investigate a degenerated plasma for a whole range of the relativity parameter ( degree of electron degeneracy ) which can extend the applications of quantum hydrodynamics model used in mentioned references to extreme conditions found in compact astrophysical objects .",
    "we also use the fermi - dirac statistics for electrons and positrons instead of the simplified thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the presentation of the article is as follows .",
    "the basic normalized plasma equations are introduced in section [ equations ] .",
    "nonlinear arbitrary - amplitude solutions are derived in section [ sagdeev ] . numerical analysis and discussions",
    "is given in section [ discussion ] and final remarks are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we use quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) model to study the nonlinear dynamics in a superdense completely degenerate electron - positron - ion plasma . the electrons / positrons are considered relativistic and follow the fermi - dirac statistics and the positively charged cold - ions are dynamic . in this model",
    "the rate of electron(positron)-ion collisions are limited due to pauli - blocking process and the pair - annihilations can be ignored @xcite .",
    "we therefore write the conventional qhd fluid equations in dimensional form as @xmath3 where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the ions and @xmath7-species number - density , mass and velocities with @xmath8 for ions and @xmath9 with @xmath10 , for electrons and positrons , respectively .",
    "also @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , present the adiabatic constant , ion - temperature and the scaled plank - constant . the normalized set of qhd equations follow from the following scaling @xmath14 where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the vacuum light speed and the characteristic plasma frequency and sound - speed , respectively , and the parameter @xmath18 denotes the electron equilibrium density .",
    "the bar symbols denote the dimensionless quantities which are omitted in forthcoming algebra for simplicity . in a relativistic",
    "completely degenerate fermi - dirac plasma , the electron / positron relativistic degeneracy pressure is expressed in the following form @xcite @xmath19 in which @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the ratio of electron / positron fermi relativistic momentum to @xmath22 . in the limits of very small and very large values of @xmath23 we obtain @xmath24 thus , the normalized qhd set of plasma equations including the electron / poitron tunneling effect by making use of the fact that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for equilibrium number - densities of electrons and positrons , respectively , with @xmath28 being the relative positron to electron number - density , can be written in the following form @xmath29^{1/2 } + { \\frac{{{m_j}}}{{{m_i}}}}\\left ( \\frac{{{h_r^{2}}}}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\partial } { { \\partial x}}\\left ( { \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt { { n_e } } } } \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}\\sqrt { { n_e } } } } { { \\partial { x^2 } } } } \\right ) , \\\\ \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}\\phi } } { { \\partial { x^2 } } } = - 4\\pi e\\left ( { \\sum\\limits_j { { s_j}{n_j } }   + { n_i } } \\right ) , \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] where , we have introduced the normalized degeneracy parameter , @xmath30 , as a measure of the relativistic degeneracy effects i.e. so called the normalized relativity parameter .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath31 denotes the relative electron number density with respect to the base value @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter , @xmath33 , is the quantum diffraction coefficient which is related to the relativity parameter via ; @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that the parameter @xmath35 is related also to the mass - density ( of white dwarf , for instance ) through the electron number - density with relation @xmath36 or @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where , @xmath39 is the proton mass .",
    "the density @xmath40 is in the range of a mass - density of a typical white dwarf and a contribution of @xmath41 has been included in mass - density definition to account for the electron - positron pair production / anihilation .",
    "the density of typical white dwarfs can be in the range @xmath42 , which , neglecting electron - positron pair production / anihilation ( @xmath43 ) , results in values of @xmath44 for the relativity parameter of a typical white dwarf .",
    "s. chandrasekhar , in ground of fermi - dirac statistics , has proven that for a white dwarf with a mass density @xmath45 , the electron degeneracy pressure turns from @xmath46 dependence for normal degeneracy ( @xmath47 ) to @xmath48 dependence for ultra - relativistic electron degeneracy ( @xmath49 ) @xcite . in this calculation",
    "we show that this behavior has also a profound effect on the propagation and stability of nonlinear ion - acoustic excitations in a white dwarf .",
    "now , neglecting the terms containing the small mass - ratio , @xmath50 and assuming that @xmath51 , we arrive at the following simplified set of basic normalized equations @xmath52^{1/2 } = 0 , \\\\ \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}\\phi } } { { \\partial { x^2 } } } = - \\sum\\limits_j { { s_j}{n_j } }   - { n_i}. \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] * in order to get the steady state solution to the hydrodynamics normalized set of fluid equations , eqs .

    "the similar plots have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the relativistically degenerate electron - ion plasma .",
    "the increase in the value of small-@xmath86 is to enhance the matching normalized propagation - speed values , while it is to decrease the values of matching normalized propagation - speed for large-@xmath86 values .",

    "2 confirm that there is a maximum matching normalized propagation - speed value for isws in @xmath54-@xmath86 plane shown for two extreme low- and high - relativistic degeneracy values , namely , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this maximum matching normalized propagation - speed value is @xmath89 for @xmath87 while it is diminished to @xmath90 for @xmath88 which correspond to ultra - relativistic degeneracy case .",

    "it is further noticed from fig .",
    "2 that the lower part of plots ( smaller @xmath86-value ) is affected more by change in the relativistic factor @xmath35 .",

    "however , it has been shown that the quantum diffraction parameter does not modify the wave amplitude ( which increases with increase in the value of relative positron concentration , @xmath86 ) and makes only corrections to the width of the nonlinear wave @xcite .",

    "it is observed from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) that for isws / ipws the increase in the relative positron concentration decreases / increases the potential depth and width for other fixed parameters .",

    "it should be distinguished that , the speed , @xmath55 , is a relativistic speed , despite the name of sound speed and is much higher ( @xmath102 comparable to the fermi - speed of electrons in typical solids ) compared to that of the ordinary plasmas .",
    "it is also remarked that , the inclusion of pair modifies greatly the high positron - concentration portion of the stability regions ( e.g. compare figs . 2 and 4 ) , as expected .",
    "note that , in calculations for the mass density , @xmath36 , there is a @xmath86-dependent term which accounts for the extra electrons produced / annihilated in the plasma . since , the current analysis is applicable to the wide range of the relativity parameter i.e. the wide plasma mass - density range ; it can also be applied to low mass - density degenerate plasma produced in laboratory .",
    "the sagdeev pseudo - potential approach was used to investigate the propagation of nonlinear ion waves in a relativistically degenerate pair plasma in the framework of quantum hydrodynamics model .",
    "the matching criteria of existence of such solitary excitations in terms of the relativistic degeneracy parameter , relative positron density were numerically investigated and the allowed matching normalized propagation - speed range , @xmath54 , for propagation of such waves was evaluated numerically .",
    "it was shown that the electron relativistic degeneracy as well as the relative positron concentration has outstanding effects on nonlinear wave dynamics of relativistically degenerate plasmas such as that found in white dwarfs and the cores of massive planets .",

    "<S> arbitrary amplitude nonlinear ion waves is investigated in an extremely degenerate electron - positron - ion plasma with relativistic electrons / positrons and dynamic cold ions using sagdeev pseudo - potential method in framework of quantum hydrodynamics model . </S>",
    "<S> the matching criteria of existence for ion solitary as well as periodic nonlinear excitations is studied numerically in terms of the relativistic degeneracy parameter , relative positron concentration and the relativistic normalized propagation - speed range of these waves are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarked that the electron relativistic degeneracy and relative positron concentration in such plasmas have significant effects on nonlinear wave propagations in relativistically degenerate fermi - dirac plasma . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with the previously reported ones obtained using semiclassical thomas - fermi approximation in dense plasmas with non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic electrons and positrons . </S>",
    "<S> current findings can be appropriate for the study of astrophysical superdense compact objects such as white dwarfs . </S>"
