    "systems that exhibit pattern formation are common in nature and patterns often emerge in the wake of a moving front @xcite .",
    "a well known example that will be studied below is the liesegang phenomenon  , the formation of precipitation patterns by a moving chemical reaction front . in a typical experimental setup ,",
    "one has a chemical reactant ( inner electrolyte ) dissolved in a gel matrix and a second reactant ( outer electrolyte ) poured onto the gel .",
    "the concentration of the outer electrolyte is much higher than that of the inner one and so it diffuses into the gel and reacts with the inner reactant . the reaction product then precipitates and , frequently , the observed precipitation patterns are a family of bands or rings ( depending on the geometry of the system ) clearly separated in the direction perpendicular to the diffusion .",
    "this process is believed to be responsible for many precipitation patterns such as the structure of agate rocks @xcite or , to cite a somewhat speculative example , the pattern of human gallstones .    although the liesegang patterns have been known for more than one hundred years  @xcite , there is still disagreement as to the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon .",
    "the main problem is the lack of a theory that could be compared with experiments quantitatively and , to a lesser degree , the lack of experiments that produce results amenable to quantitative theoretical analysis . at first",
    "the task appears to be simple .",
    "the liesegang bands are formed at times @xmath0 at some positions @xmath1 ( measured from the planes separating the reagents at the initial moment ) , and have a width @xmath2 .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath2 obey the following generic laws :    \\i ) after a transient time , the position @xmath1 of the @xmath4-th band is related to the time @xmath0 of its formation through the so - called _ time law _ , @xmath5 , first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the time law is a rather obvious consequence of the diffusive motion of a reaction front in a gel and thus it is considered to be understood .",
    "\\ii ) for large @xmath4 , the ratio of the positions of two consecutive bands approaches a constant value 1+p [ 1+p ] with @xmath6 typically .",
    "this last property is known as the jablczynski law  @xcite or the _ spacing law _ and @xmath7",
    "is called the _ spacing coefficient_. most of the detailed experimental observations concern this law .",
    "it has been found that the spacing coefficient is a nonuniversal quantity .",
    "it depends for example on the concentrations @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the outer and inner electrolytes which can be controlled experimentally .",
    "based on several different experiments , matalon and packter   concluded that : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are decreasing functions of their arguments . for various reagents , they found @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 is less known but it is generally observed that it decreases with increasing @xmath9 . the observation expressed in equation ( [ matpac ] ) is usually called the _ matalon - packter law_.    a problem with the matalon - packter law is that , experimentally , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can usually be changed only by a factor 5 - 10 and , furthermore , @xmath16 itself has a significant error bar since it is determined from a finite number of @xmath1-s ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus the functional form ( [ matpac ] ) is far from unique , it should be considered as a power law fit to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) finally , the _ width law _ states that the width @xmath2 of the @xmath4-th band is an increasing function of @xmath4 and typically @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "since the definition of @xmath2 is open to debate and the error bars in the measurements of @xmath2 are rather large , this quantity has largely been ignored in the quantitative discussions of liesegang phenomena .",
    "although there are a large number of interesting and often puzzling observations about liesegang phenomena in particular systems , the above three points appear to be the only ones which describe quantifiable results and carry some generality .",
    "one would expect that so few experimental facts can be explained easily .",
    "indeed , there are several competing theories many of which fare well as far as the derivation of the time and spacing laws are concerned @xcite .",
    "all these theories follow how the diffusive reagents ( ions in the outer and inner electrolytes ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 turn into immobile precipitate @xmath21 a+b ... c ... d [ process ] by taking into account various scenarios for the intermediate steps denoted as @xmath22 .",
    "since the precipitate appears through some kind of supersaturation , further differences in theories arise from the details of treating the nucleation thresholds and the growth kinetics of the precipitate .",
    "the simplest ( and first developed ) theory is based on the concept of _ supersaturation of ion - product _",
    "@xcite and has been developed by many researchers .",
    "in this theory , there is no intermediate step in - between @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "when the local product of the concentrations of the reactants , @xmath24 , reaches some critical value , @xmath25 , nucleation of the precipitate @xmath21 occurs .",
    "the nucleated particles grow and deplete @xmath19 and @xmath20 in their surroundings . as a consequence ,",
    "the local level of @xmath24 drops and no new nucleation takes place .",
    "this continues until the reaction zone ( where @xmath24 is maximum ) moves far enough that the depletion effect of the precipitate becomes weak .",
    "then @xmath26 is reached again and nucleation can occur .",
    "the repetition of this process leads to the formation of bands .    in the next level of complexity",
    ", theories contain a single intermediate step in @xmath27 with the mechanism of band formation based on the supersaturation of the intermediate compound @xmath28",
    "it is assumed that @xmath19 and @xmath20 react to produce a new species @xmath28 which also diffuses in the gel .",
    "the nature of @xmath28 is not really specified , it may be a molecule as well as a colloid particle .",
    "when the local concentration of @xmath28 reaches some threshold value , nucleation occurs and the nucleated particles , @xmath21 , act as aggregation seeds .",
    "the @xmath28 particles near to @xmath21 aggregate to the existing droplet ( hence become @xmath21 ) provided their local concentration is larger than a given aggregation threshold .",
    "these models are characterized by two thresholds , one for nucleation and one for droplet growth .",
    "the depletion mechanism is similar to the one described for the ion - product theory and it leads to band formation .",
    "we shall refer to this theory as the theory of _ nucleation and droplet growth_.    a variation of the single intermediate compound theories is based on the idea of an _ induced sol - coagulation _ process . the compound @xmath28 is assumed to be the sol and this sol coagulates if the following two conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , the concentration of @xmath28 exceeds a supersaturation threshold @xmath29 and , second , the local concentration of the outer electrolyte is above a threshold @xmath30 that is often referred to as the critical coagulation concentration threshold .",
    "the band formation is a consequence of the nucleation and growth of the precipitate combined with the motion of the front where @xmath31 .",
    "the time- and the spacing laws follow from the above theories .",
    "thus , to select the correct theory ( provided there is a single theory for all liesegang phenomena ) , one would have to calculate the functional form of @xmath32 in order to find agreement or disagreement with the matalon - packter law .",
    "the spacing coefficient , however , is obtained from the numerical solution of complicated coupled nonlinear differential equations and , as a consequence , the results are in an implicit form that is not particularly useful for deducing @xmath32 .",
    "a notable exception is the simplest version of the ion - product theory which was used by wagner @xcite to derive a result , @xmath33 , that is at variance with the matalon - packter law .",
    "wagner s result raises the question whether the present theories contain the matalon - packter law at all and our aim here is to discuss this question and make an attempt at answering it .    in attempting to derive the matalon - packter law",
    ", our basic aim is to keep the calculations and formulas simple so that the explicit dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath9 could be displayed .",
    "accordingly , we have to make simplifying assumptions .",
    "the first two of these assumptions are about the experimental setup and the majority of the experiments satisfy the constraints described there .",
    "the remaining assumptions are based on observations of the time evolution of the concentrations of the reactants and reaction products obtained from numerical solution of the appropriate equations , from simulations of the process @xcite , and also from experience with the analytical solution of the problem of chemical reaction zone @xcite .",
    "we believe that the important features of the original problem are not lost after making the assumptions listed below .    1 .",
    "the experimental setup can be described by one - dimensional reaction - diffusion equations ( the gel is in a testube whose length is much larger than its diameter ) .",
    "the concentration of the outer electrolyte ( @xmath8 ) is assumed to be much larger than that of the inner electrolyte ( @xmath9 ) and it is also assumed that @xmath34 is kept fixed at @xmath35 , [ @xmath36 . in experiments one typically has @xmath37 .",
    "reaction zones and the precipitation bands are much narrower than the diffusion length",
    ". 4 .   all concentration profiles can be approximated by straight lines in the neighborhood of the reaction zones and precipitation bands .",
    "the slopes of the straight lines are determined by the diffusion lengths and by the asymptotic concentrations of the reacting species .",
    "an existing precipitation band acts as a sink ( with @xmath38 or @xmath39 boundary condition ) for the inner electrolyte and for the intermediate compound ( this is an assumption about the reaction and aggregation rates being sufficiently large ) .    using the above assumptions",
    ", we can derive relatively simple expressions for @xmath32 for all three classes of theories ( in sec.2 for supersturation of ion - product , in sec.3 for nucleation and droplet growth , and in sec.4 for induced sol - coagulation theories ) .",
    "the results are compared both with the corresponding numerical solutions of the non - simplified models and with experimental data .",
    "contains our final remarks .",
    "in closing the introduction , we list the symbols frequently used in the text :    @xmath40 - concentration of outer electrolyte , @xmath19 ;    @xmath41 - concentration of inner electrolyte , @xmath20 ;    @xmath42 - initial concentrations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ;    @xmath43 - dimensionless ratio of initial concentrations ;    @xmath44 - concentration of sol ( or intermediate compound ) ;    @xmath45 - diffusion coefficients of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath28 ;    @xmath46 - effective diffusion coefficient of reaction front ( @xmath47 ) ;    @xmath25 - ion - product threshold ;    @xmath48 - nucleation ( coagulation ) threshold ;    @xmath49 - threshold for induced coagulation ;    @xmath1 - position of the @xmath4-th precipitation band ;    @xmath0 - time of formation of the @xmath4-th band ;    @xmath50 - spacing coefficient .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case of the reaction @xmath51 .",
    "the ion - product supersaturation theory is based on the assumption that precipitation of @xmath21 at time @xmath52 and at a site @xmath53 occurs if the product of ion concentrations @xmath54 exceeds a threshold value a(x , t)b(x , t)q^ * .",
    "[ crition ] in the mean - field theory , the equations describing this reaction - diffusion process are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the diffusion constants of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath58 is the step function describing an infinitely sharp threshold for precipitation with @xmath59 being the rate constant .",
    "the last terms on the right hand sides represent the aggregation onto the existing precipitate of concentration @xmath60 .",
    "the initial conditions to the above equations are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "these equations can be solved numerically and our analytical expression found for @xmath32 in the above process is in accord with the numerical results . before deriving the results , however , let us show how the structure of the result may emerge from a simple dimensional analysis .",
    "if we assume that both the precipitation ( @xmath59 ) and aggregation ( @xmath64 ) rates go to infinity then it follows from dimensional considerations that the dimensionless spacing coefficient can be expressed through the available dimensionless combinations of the parameters and so we have p = p ( ; ; ) further simplification can be made by assuming that @xmath65 is not singular in its first argument and setting this argument to zero since in experiments @xmath66 .",
    "then the matalon - packter law can emerge only if @xmath65 is linear in its third argument thus giving p = p_1()+p_2 ( ) . we emphasize that this is not a derivation of the desired result .",
    "this is , however , what we shall show to be valid in the experimentally investigated range ( @xmath67 ) of possible @xmath16-s . our calculation is based on a simple analytical approach combined with numerical evaluation of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] gives a characteristic picture showing the concentration profiles as well as the ion - product profile past the formation of the precipitation band @xmath1 and just before the appearance of the @xmath70-th band .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the linearization of the concentration profiles is a good assumption and accordingly , in the neighborhood of @xmath1 , we can approximate the concentrations as a(x , t)=&a_0(1- ) , + b(x , t)=&(x - x_n ) .",
    "the condition for the @xmath71-st band to appear is that the maximum of the @xmath24 product reaches the value @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to the following two equations a(x_n+1,t_n+1 ) b(x_n+1,t_n+1)= q^ * [ prag1 ] + [ a(x , t)b(x , t)]_x_n+1,t_n+1=0[prag2 ] the second equation gives a simple relationship between @xmath72 , @xmath1 and @xmath73 = 2x_n+1-x_n which allows us to eliminate @xmath72 from equation ( [ prag1 ] ) and to obtain an equation for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "assuming now that @xmath4 is large enough that we can use the approximation = 1+p , and one obtains the following equation for @xmath16 : ( p)= p^3/2(1+p)(1 + 2p)^2 = [ pragmatpack1 ] .",
    "this equation clearly has a @xmath76 solution for small values of @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath16 increases with @xmath78 and and goes to infinity for @xmath79 , accounting for the fact that no bands can be formed if @xmath80 is too small for @xmath24 to reach the critical value @xmath25 .    at first sight",
    ", the matalon - packter law does not follow from this theory , since @xmath16 depends on @xmath8 and @xmath9 only through @xmath80 . furthermore",
    ", another problem is that , for small @xmath16 , we obtain wagner s result @xcite , namely the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath8 is of the form p~a_0 ^ -2/3 in contrast to the matalon - packter prediction @xmath81 .",

    ", @xmath83 is very well approximated as a straight line ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) with parameters @xmath84 .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , we can write ( [ pragmatpack1 ] ) as a matalon - packter law with @xmath85 and @xmath86 p=0.02 + 5 . in this approach",
    "we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 . numerical solution of the equations  ( [ prager_uno],[prager_due ] ) indicates that , in reality , the @xmath16 is given to an excellent accuracy by p 0.18 - 0.052 ( ) ^1/3 + [ mataionproduct ]    for @xmath89 , the order of magnitude for @xmath90 agrees with the order of magnitude values of @xmath11 in experiments @xcite and the @xmath91 dependence is also the experimentally observed behavior .",

    "it changes not only as @xmath93 is varied but it also depends on @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally observed @xmath15 is also more varied than being just @xmath86 .",
    "thus we must conclude that although it is possible to derive the matalon - packter law from the ion - product supersaturation theory , the resulting functions @xmath94 and @xmath86 are too simple to account for experimental observations .",
    "the theory at the next level of complexity assumes that the @xmath95 reaction yields the precipitate @xmath21 through an intermediate compound @xmath28 .",
    "this compound may , in principle , be a molecule @xmath96 but it may as well be a sol particle formed by @xmath19 and @xmath20 and , possibly , by some other background ions .",
    "all this rather complicated situation is described by assuming that the @xmath28-s can be treated as a diffusing species which precipitates if its concentration exceeds a threshold @xmath48 .",
    "the precipitate , @xmath21 , grows by collecting the neighboring @xmath28-s and the various theories differ in the sophistication of the description of this nucleation and growth process . in our case",
    "the nucleation threshold is sharp at @xmath48 and precipitate will be assumed to be a perfect sink for the @xmath28-s .    in order to understand the formation of precipitate , we observe that the reaction zone ( where the @xmath28-s are produced ) is narrow @xcite and that @xmath44 reaches its maximum there ( see fig.[fig3 ] for characteristic concentration profiles just before the @xmath71-st band forms ) .",
    "the @xmath4-th band acts as a sink and thus the @xmath28-s ( or about half of them ) formed at the front , @xmath97 , end up in this band .    with a good approximation",
    ", we can assume that at time @xmath72 , when @xmath98 reaches the threshold value @xmath48 and the @xmath99-th band is about to form , the concentration of @xmath28-s exhibits a triangular - like shape and it varies linearly between @xmath100 and @xmath101 . as a consequence , we can estimate the current flowing to the @xmath4-th band as j = d_c .",
    "[ current ] next we note that the front becomes quasistationary in the large - time limit ( its velocity goes as @xmath102 and so we can assume that the above expression for the current is valid in the whole time interval @xmath103 $ ] ( numerical solutions of the reaction - diffusion equations support this assumption ) .",
    "then the amount of @xmath28 which disappears into the @xmath4-th band during the time interval @xmath103 $ ] can be computed as n_cj ( t_n+1-t_n)= d_c c^*.

[ peq ]    the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath48 in the above expression are material parameters .",
    "the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath8 and @xmath9 enters through the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath46 of the front and through the concentration , @xmath106 , of @xmath28-s left behind by the moving front .",
    "the remaining task is thus to determine @xmath46 and @xmath106 .",
    "we start with the case of @xmath89 which can be discussed with relative ease @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for this case that @xmath109 is determined from the following equation : ( ) = , [ df ] where @xmath110 is the error function @xcite and @xmath43 .",
    "the remarkable feature of the solution of this equation is that , for the experimentally relevant values @xmath111 , the inverse of @xmath46 is very well approximated by a linear function of @xmath112 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) _ 1+_20.158 + 4.03 .",
    "[ dfinv ] this is an important observation since it follows from ( [ peq ] ) that @xmath113 for small @xmath16 and the matalon - packter law will emerge as a consequence of the above equation .",

    "the behavior of @xmath116 as a function of @xmath112 for @xmath117 is given on figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath116 is linear in @xmath112 in the experimentally relevant region and thus equation ( [ dfinv ] ) emerges again but the constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 are now dependent on @xmath93 .",
    "we turn now to the calculation of @xmath106 .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the width of the reaction zone is much smaller than the diffusion length @xcite and thus the reaction zone can be approximated as a point at @xmath120 where both concentrations @xmath121 and @xmath122 approach zero .",
    "this means that the field @xmath41 satisfies the diffusion equation with the reaction term replaced by the boundary condition @xmath123 and the other boundary condition being @xmath124 .",
    "once this moving boundary problem is solved , the number of @xmath28-s , @xmath104 , produced up to a given time is obtained by the time integral of the current @xmath125 evaluated at @xmath97 .",
    "finally , @xmath106 is found by dividing @xmath104 by the advance of the front in time @xmath52 , @xmath126 ( here we use the fact that the density of @xmath28-s produced by the front is constant in space  @xcite ) .",
    "the result of this calculation is given by c_0= ^-1 .",
    "[ c_0exact ] for @xmath89 and @xmath127 we can use equation ( [ df ] ) in conjunction with the asymptotics of the error function @xcite to obtain @xmath128 .",

    "for @xmath127 , we have @xmath129 and thus the front moves fast into the region of @xmath20-s and , consequently , the @xmath20-s can be treated as immobile particles yielding @xmath128 .",
    "corrections to the @xmath128 result can also be calculated using again the asymptotics of the error function @xcite .",

    "moreover , we shall assume that @xmath49 is much smaller than @xmath8 so that the right - hand side of eq.([fleq4 ] ) can be expanded in @xmath159 .",
    "there is no experimental information on @xmath49 and , although @xmath160 seems to be a natural assumption , we must be cautious with the @xmath161 limit .",
    "the problem is that the picture we are working with for the induced sol - coagulation theory ( figure [ fig6 ] ) is not valid for arbitrary small @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , the fact that the position of the @xmath47 reaction front , @xmath97 is far ahead of the point of formation of the @xmath71-st band means that diffusion length of the @xmath28 particles is smaller than @xmath162 < x_f(t_n+1)-x_n+1 .",
    "[ a*/a0condition ]    using equations ( [ fleq3],[fleq4 ] ) and neglecting higher order terms in @xmath16 and @xmath159 , the above equation yields < .",
    "[ a*limit ] the meaning of this result is the following .",
    "the place where the new band nucleates moves to the @xmath47 reaction zone and thus the inequality ( [ a*/a0condition ] ) gets violated upon increasing @xmath108 or @xmath163 and decreasing @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear thus that , at fixed values of the other parameters , @xmath159 can not be taken to zero .",
    "the lack of the limit @xmath161 has the consequence that the result for the nucleation - and - growth theory ( [ matanucl ] ) can not be obtained from ( [ fleq4 ] ) .",
    "the matter of finding an expression for @xmath16 valid in the @xmath161 limit and reducing to ( [ matanucl ] ) appears to be a rather difficult task since various lengthscales become comparable approaching this limit .",
    "we have not been able to obtain such an interpolating formula .",
    "returning to ( [ a*limit ] ) , we see that the material parameters can be such ( e.g. if @xmath164 ) that @xmath159 can be small without the inequality ( [ a*limit ] ) being violated . for such range of parameters",
    "we can expand ( [ fleq4 ] ) in @xmath159 and obtain again a version of the matalon - packter law : p=+ [ matainduced ]    the spacing coefficient ( [ matainduced ] ) can again be compared with that obtained from the appropriate reaction diffusion equations ( the equations for the nucleation - and - growth theory must be augmented with the condition that nucleation can occur only if @xmath30 ) .",
    "an exhaustive numerical study is practically impossible due to the number of parameters in the problem ( @xmath112 , @xmath159 , @xmath165 , @xmath93 , @xmath166 ) , plus the rates of reaction , nucleation , and aggregation ) .",
    "one can easily miss regimes of nontrivial behavior in this high dimensional parameter space and we claim with this numerical study only that the matalon - packter law as given by equation ( [ matainduced ] ) is indeed observed for a reasonable range of parameters ( figures [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "as one can see from ( [ matainduced ] ) , the induced sol - coagulation theory provides us with f(b_0)~1/b_0 ^ 2 , g(b_0)~(+b_0)/b_0 ^ 2 .",
    "[ fgsolcoag ]    the power law form @xmath167 is close to what has been observed in some experiments @xcite and the fact that @xmath15 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 is also in accord with the observations .",
    "it should also be clear that a more precise theory of the induced sol - coagulation process should reproduce , in the @xmath161 limit , the result @xmath168 obtained in the nucleation - and - growth theory .",
    "thus , assuming that the crossover between the @xmath169 and the @xmath170 behaviours is smooth , one should be able to find regimes where @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "since this covers a large portion of the experimentally observed range @xmath173 , we conclude that the induced sol - coagulation theory provides the best description of the pattern formation in liesegang phenomena .",
    "our main results are summarized in equations ( [ mataionproduct ] ) , ( [ matanucl ] ) , and ( [ matainduced ] ) giving the matalon - packter law for the three main theories , respectively . comparing these formulas , we arrived at our main conclusion , namely that the induced sol - coagulation theory is the best in describing the experimental observations on the spacing coefficient of liesegang patterns .",
    "it is no doubt that the arguments used in the derivation of @xmath16 can be refined and made more precise . the main aim of our work , however , was the demonstration that the matalon - packter law can be understood in terms of simple pictures for which it is possible to develop analytical arguments .",
    "we hope that one can build on these results and achieve a better understanding of liesegang phenomena .",
    "in particular , it would be important to find a description of the induced sol - coagulation process which contained the crossover to results for the nucleation - and - growth model .",
    "furthermore , we have just considered the simplest cases associated with the reaction @xmath47 . in experiments , equally important are the @xmath174 and @xmath175 cases and , obviously , one should also explore the possibilites associated with these and , possibly , more complicated reaction schemes . finally , an interesting and important test of the conclusion that the induced sol - coagulation theory is preferable in the studies of liesegang phenomena would be the application of this theory for the _ quantitative _ description of revert patterns .",
    "we thank b. chopard , p. hantz , and t. unger for useful discussions . this work has been partially supported by the swiss national science foundation in the framework of the cooperation in science and research with ceec / nis , by the hungarian academy of sciences ( grant otka t 019451 ) , and by the epsrc , united kingdom ( grant no .",

    "there are systems that display revert patterns , namely the distance between the bands decreases with band number instead of increasing as in the normal liesegang phenomena . in these cases",
    "@xmath176 i.e. @xmath177 and the matalon - packter law is clearly not applicable .                              there is a class of theories which attribute the liesegang band formation to the instability present in the postnucleation coarsening process .",
