    "nova is a thermonuclear runaway event on a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) . during a nova outburst ,",
    "the envelope on the wd expands considerably and engulfs its mass - donating companion unless it is a wide binary . as the companion orbits in the nova envelope , frictional processes between the envelope and the companion produces thermal energy . in 1980",
    "s , it was believed that these frictional processes play an important role to eject the envelope and to shorten the nova duration by a factor of 10 or more @xcite .",
    "this idea was originally proposed to reconcile observed short durations of classical novae ( @xmath1 1 yr ) with long timescales of nuclear burning ( @xmath1 1000 yr ) . however , the drag energy deposition is not effective for mass ejection in the common envelope phase of novae because the envelope masses are too small to produce drag - energy enough to eject the envelope @xcite .    in the beginning of 1990",
    "s , opacity tables were revised ( opal opacity : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of which a prominent peak at @xmath2(k)@xmath3 is strong enough to accelerate optically thick winds even in relatively less massive wds of @xmath4 .",
    "this wind is as massive as @xmath5  yr@xmath6 or more .",
    "the nova duration is drastically reduced so that the theoretical duration becomes comparable to the observed one ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the wind occurs , frictional effects are ineffective , because the density at the orbit is too low to produce large energy deposition .",
    "moreover , the wind is accelerated deep inside the orbit and the wind velocity has already reached the escape velocity at the orbit .",
    "thus , once the optically thick winds occur , the presence of a companion has virtually no effects on the envelope structure nor on the duration of nova outbursts @xcite .",
    "there are observational indications that frictional process is not effective in nova outbursts .",
    "if the frictional process is very effective in mass ejection , there should be a clear dependence of nova light curve shapes on the orbital period , but no such properties are known .",
    "for example , the recurrent nova rs oph shows a very fast development of optical light curve @xcite similar to that of u sco .",
    "rs oph is a long period binary of @xmath7 days @xcite , so that the wd photosphere does not reach the companion even at the maximum expansion @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frictional processes of companion do not work in the whole period of the nova outburst . on the other hand ,",
    "u sco is a short period binary of @xmath8 days @xcite and the companion star is engulfed deeply in the envelope during the outburst .",
    "the 1999 and 2010 outbursts of u sco were densely observed , but there is no indication for additional acceleration nor enhanced mass ejection due to the companion motion @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed a number of nova light curves with the universal decline law based on the optically thick winds @xcite .",
    "if the companion motion strongly contributes to the acceleration of matter , there should be a change in the decline rates of light curves when the companion reappears from the extended envelope of the wd .",
    "however , none of them show a particular change in the light curves before and after the epoch that the companion reappeared from the envelope .",
    "we refer two examples of classical novae , with a densely observed light curve and known orbital period : v1500 cyg ( @xmath9 days , see the light curves in figure 13 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the companion emerged on days @xmath10 but nothing had happened , and also v458 vul ( @xmath11 days , in figure 26 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the companion emerged on days @xmath12 but nothing happened .",
    "these are good counterevidence against the effectiveness of frictional process .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that frictional processes are not effective in novae whenever strong optically thick winds blow .    in our theoretical models , optically thick winds always occur in nova outbursts on massive wds ( @xmath13 ) but do not occur in less massive wds ( @xmath14 ) . between them , i.e. , @xmath10.50.7 @xmath15 , both types of nova evolutions , with / without optically thick winds , are realized for the same wd mass @xcite . when no optically thick winds are accelerated , nova outbursts show a slow evolution with a long - lasted flat optical maximum , in contrast with usual classical novae that show a sharp optical maximum caused by a rapid evolution due to wind mass loss @xcite .",
    "the first example of such no - optically thick wind evolution is the symbiotic nova pu vul , in which a flat optical peak lasted 3000 days and showed very quiet spectra indicating no strong winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented an idea that a nova outburst started in a state of no - optically thick winds ( we call this `` static evolution '' ) and then possibly changes to be in a state of optically thick winds ( `` wind evolution '' ) .",
    "they also suggested that such a transition may accompany violent activities such as oscillatory behaviors in the light curves of some slow novae .    here , we present an idea that a companion star plays a role in changing the nova envelope structure from `` static '' to `` wind . ''",
    "if this occurs in low - mass wds , it may relate to the peculiar light curves of slow novae . as an application of such a transition to slow novae like v723 cas",
    ", we have examined effects of a companion star with one - dimensional ( 1d ) approximation of nova envelopes . in section [ sec_model ] , we briefly introduce our method .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "applications to slow novae appear in section [ sec_slownova ] .",
    "discussion and summary follow in sections [ sec_discussion ] and [ sec_summary ] .",
    "we consider low - mass wds in which no optically thick winds are accelerated in the beginning of nova outbursts .",
    "this may happen in low - mass wds ( @xmath16 ) under some conditions of the initial envelope mass and chemical composition ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "after a thermonuclear runaway sets in , the envelope greatly expands and the optical brightness increases to reach a flat maximum .",
    "we approximate the nova evolution by a sequence of hydrostatic solutions when no optically thick winds occur , and by a sequence of steady - state solutions with optically thick winds when it occurs . in these sequences of solutions",
    "the envelope mass is decreasing due to nuclear burning and wind mass loss if it occurs , from which we calculate evolution timescale . this quasi - evolution is a good approximation because the thermal / dynamical timescale between two successive solutions are short enough compared with the evolution timescale of novae .    for static solutions",
    "we solve the equations of hydrostatic balance , mass continuity , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy , from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere assuming spherical symmetry . for wind solutions ,",
    "we solve the equation of motion assuming steady - state , instead of hydrostatic balance @xcite .",
    "convective energy transport is calculated in static solutions using the mixing length theory with the ratio of mixing length to pressure scale hight @xmath17 ( see * ? ? ? * for effects of the @xmath18 parameter on static solutions ) .",
    "the occurrence of optically thick winds is detected by the condition described in @xcite . in our numerical calculations",
    ", we adopt more than 8000 meshes and always insert @xmath19 meshes in the interacting region between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the position of the companion from the wd center and @xmath23 is the accretion radius as defined below .",
    "the chemical composition of the envelope is simply assumed to be uniform with the composition of @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , which are representative values for slow novae ( see table 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we assume an 0.55 @xmath15 wd and an 0.4 @xmath15 main - sequence ( ms ) companion that fills its roche lobe unless otherwise stated .",
    "this 0.4 @xmath15 is close to an upper limit of the companion mass , 0.44 @xmath15 , in a binary system with thermally stable mass transfer ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume such a large mass because a more massive companion has larger effects on the wd envelope .",
    "three effects of the companion on the wd envelope are considered here : ( 1 ) spun - up by the companion motion , ( 2 ) gravity of the companion star , and ( 3 ) drag luminosity due to frictional energy deposition .",
    "we incorporated these effects in our computer code as explained in the following subsections .      in the very beginning of a nova outburst",
    ", the envelope has so small specific angular momentum compared with the specific orbital angular momentum .",
    "after the envelope expands to a giant size , it begins to counterrotate on the rotating frame with the companion due to conservation of the local angular momentum .",
    "the outer part of the envelope may be spun up due to frictional effects of the companion motion .",
    "we incorporate the effect of centrifugal force in our 1d code .",
    "we modified the equation of hydrostatic balance as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angular velocity .",
    "this is a 1d approximation that may represent envelope structure in the equatorial plane .",
    "here we introduce the effective mass parameter @xmath29 and rewrite equation ( [ equ_hydrostatic ] ) as @xmath30 @xmath31 the factor @xmath29 represents the degree how much the gravity is effectively reduced due to the centrifugal force . in other words , the effective mass decreases to @xmath32 .",
    "we , hereafter , call @xmath29 the mass reducing factor .",
    "we assumed a simplified rotation law for the envelope ; a rigid rotation in the inner part of the envelope ( @xmath33 ) and a keplerian - like rotation in the outer part ( @xmath34 ) . since the envelope is spun up by the companion motion inside the outer lagrange point",
    ", we define the rigid rotation radius as @xmath35 because the outer lagrange point is located at @xmath36 from the companion center .",
    "for the inner part ( @xmath33 ) , we assume a solid rotation with an angular velocity of @xmath37 , here @xmath38 is a parameter that represents the ratio of the angular velocity of the envelope to that of the companion , @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , @xmath38 means the ratio of the envelope velocity to the companion velocity at the orbit .",
    "for the outer part ( @xmath34 ) we assume that the rotation velocity of the envelope varies as @xmath40 as the keplerian velocity does . in this case",
    ", the angular velocity @xmath28 changes as @xmath41 , and can be expressed as @xmath42 .",
    "using kepler s law @xmath43 , the specific centrifugal force can be rewritten as @xmath44 then @xmath29 becomes @xmath45 here we use @xmath46 at @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is constant at @xmath34 .",
    "approximations of these centrifugal force and 1d approximation are discussed in sections [ discussion_spherical ] and [ discussion_rotation_law ] .      in our 1d approximation",
    ", we have simply assumed that the companion is distributed uniformly within a shell of @xmath47 .",
    "since the envelope mass ( @xmath48 to @xmath49 ) is much smaller than that of the companion ( @xmath50 ) , the change of @xmath51 is essentially due to the mass distribution of the companion , i.e. , @xmath52 inside the radius of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 outside the radius of @xmath55 .",
    "these treatments are essentially the same as those in @xcite .",
    "figure [ drag ] shows examples of the angular velocity @xmath28 , mass distribution @xmath56 , mass reducing factor @xmath29 , and effective mass @xmath57 for our envelope models . here , @xmath29 is unity in the deep inside the envelope ( @xmath58 ) , but 0.971 , 0.741 , 0.578 and 0.418 in the outer region ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath59 , and 0.45 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , we have @xmath62 at @xmath34 , i.e. , the companion gravity is almost canceled by the centrifugal force .",
    "a small peak of the effective mass appears near @xmath63 ( cm)@xmath64 11.0 because @xmath51 is constant ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) outside @xmath66 , whereas @xmath28 begins to decrease from a bit outside , at @xmath67      we treat the drag luminosity in spherical ( 1d ) approximation in the same way as in the other previous works @xcite .",
    "the drag luminosity generated in the region from @xmath68 to @xmath69 can be approximated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the density of the envelope , @xmath72 is the relative velocity between the envelope and the companion star , @xmath73 is the cross - sectional area between a circular strip from @xmath68 to @xmath69 and a circle with the radius @xmath23 , the center of which is located at the orbit , @xmath74 . here",

    "the total drag luminosity is @xmath81 where the integral region is from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "we take the companion radius itself , @xmath84 , as the accretion radius instead of @xmath23 when @xmath23 is smaller than the companion radius .",
    "if both the density and @xmath23 are constant in space , the drag luminosity becomes the standard expression , i.e. , @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "figure [ struc.norotation ] shows distribution of the temperature , density , diffusive luminosity , and the local eddington luminosity . we do not include the effects of a companion for blue and green lines .",
    "the local eddington luminosity ( dotted lines ) is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the opacity .",
    "we used the opal opacity @xcite .",
    "as the opacity is a function of the temperature and density , and @xmath51 is also the function of the radius ( see figure [ drag ] ) , the eddington luminosity is also a local variable .",
    "the blue and three green lines in figure [ struc.norotation ] depict the envelope solutions of @xmath88 ( k)=4.9 , 4.6 , 4.3 and 3.81 for the case of no companion star .",
    "these envelopes have essentially the same structure except for the surface region . as reported by @xcite , a static envelope has a core - halo structure of the density in which a large density inversion layer develops deep inside the photosphere .",
    "the density - inversion region corresponds to the super - eddington region .",
    "the local eddington luminosity has the deepest local minimum between @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath1 10.0 and 11.0 , corresponding to the peak of the opal opacity at @xmath89 ( k ) @xmath90 .",
    "this density - inversion arises in order to keep hydrostatic balance in the super - eddington region ( @xmath91 ) as expected from the equation of hydrostatic balance @xcite .",
    "inefficient convections occur in the region of @xmath92 but are unable to carry all of the diffusive energy flux .",
    "black and red lines in figure [ struc.norotation ] indicate the models in which the companion s gravity and drag luminosity are incorporated .",
    "the three envelopes denoted by the black lines have very similar structures at @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath93 .",
    "the drag energy deposition is small as explained below .",
    "therefore , the diffusive luminosity barely increases around the orbit in the model of @xmath88 ( k)=3.9 , in which the drag luminosity deposition is 1.8% of the total flux .    comparing these envelope models ( black lines ) with those without the companion effects ( green and blue lines )",
    ", we see that the envelope matter is significantly re - distributed due to the companion s effects . in the presence of the companion ,",
    "the eddington luminosity , outside the orbit is @xmath94 , which is larger than that without companion @xmath95 .",
    "this difference causes different energy flux as shown in figure [ struc.norotation ] , @xmath96 erg  s@xmath6 in the model of black thick lines , whereas @xmath97 erg  s@xmath6 in the green thick lines .",
    "therefore , these two envelopes are in different hydrostatic balance .",
    "a lower luminosity leads to a larger local super - eddington region which causes a wider density - inversion region .",
    "the solution depicted by red lines has a photosphere just outside the companion orbit .",
    "its photospheric luminosity is close to those of the solutions with the companion , but the structure is something between the two solutions with / without the companion .",
    "figure [ struc.mcomp ] compares structures of envelope models for @xmath98 among companion masses of @xmath99 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 @xmath15 . for a larger companion mass ,",
    "the density inversion layer is smaller . in this way",
    ", the companion gravity has a role of redistribution of the envelope matter through different hydrostatic balance of gravity and pressure - gradient ; a large luminosity causes larger radiation pressure gradient so that the matter is pushed outward . dotted and dashed lines indicate the models with enhanced drag luminosities which will be explained in section [ discussion_spherical ] .",
    "when the envelope rotates , the centrifugal force has an effect to reduce the gravity by the factor @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ struc.compari ] shows the envelope structure for @xmath88 ( k)=4.3 with different angular velocity of @xmath38=0.0 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.383 , and 0.45 . for a larger @xmath38 ,",
    "the centrifugal force becomes larger , which reduces the effective gravity .",
    "when @xmath60 , the gravity of the companion ( @xmath50 ) is almost canceled as discussed earlier ( see figure [ drag ] ) , and the envelope has a structure very close to that of the solution without the companion effects . if we further increase @xmath38 to 0.45 , the envelope structure does not change much anymore except for the outer region where the temperature and density quickly drops ( see the purple dash - dotted lines ) .      figure [ struc.compari ] also shows the structures of optically thick wind solutions .",
    "the optically thick winds are accelerated due to the peak of opal opacity which locates deep inside the photosphere .",
    "the wind velocity quickly increases around the critical point and reaches the terminal velocity deep inside the photosphere @xcite .",
    "optically thick wind solutions hardly change its structure once it is accelerated even if there are some changes of acceleration source like opacity in the outside of the critical point .",
    "figure [ struc.compari ] shows optically thick wind solutions for three different @xmath38 , which correspond to different effective gravities as in figure [ drag ] . as the critical point locates far inside the companion orbit and the winds",
    "are already accelerated there , the companion s gravity hardly changes the internal structure .",
    "we already found that the drag energy deposition is small compared with the total luminosity .",
    "for example , it is only 3.2% of the photospheric luminosity in the model of @xmath88 ( k ) @xmath100 ( black solid line in figure [ struc.mcomp ] ) .",
    "this small contribution comes from the low density near the companion orbit because the drag luminosity is proportional to the density . using equation ( [ equ_drag_simple ] ) , we estimate it as @xmath101 almost the same as our model value of 3.2% .",
    "this low density is caused by the opacity peak as shown in figure [ struc.norotation ] .",
    "the density is almost constant around the companion orbit .",
    "thus , the drag luminosity is almost independent of the orbital size .",
    "if we assume a less massive companion , then we have a smaller @xmath23 .",
    "for a smaller companion mass , on the other hand , the companion s roche radius is smaller , so the companion comes into closer to the wd and the envelope s density is higher at the companion s orbit .",
    "however , a smaller radius ( accretion radius ) effect overcomes the effect of slightly higher density . as a result , a @xmath102 companion produces a hundred times smaller drag luminosity than an @xmath103 companion does .",
    "thus , an 0.4 @xmath15 companion gives almost an upper limit of the drag energy deposition for the 0.55 @xmath15 wd model . during a nova outburst , the photospheric radius decreases with time and the density around the orbit slightly decreases with time as shown in figure [ struc.norotation ] in the case of static envelopes .",
    "therefore , the drag luminosity decreases with time . in the case of rotating static envelopes ,",
    "the density around the orbit is as small as or smaller than that for the non - rotating envelope as shown in figure [ struc.compari ] , so the drag luminosity is also too small .    in the case of optically thick wind envelopes , the density around the orbit is also as small as or much smaller than those of the static envelopes as shown in figure [ struc.compari ] . during the outburst ,",
    "the density around the orbit decreases with time as will be shown later in figure [ density.evolution ] . in this way",
    ", we do not expect large drag luminosities during nova outbursts either in the static or in the wind evolution .",
    "figure [ drag_efficiency ] shows the ratio of the drag luminosity to the photospheric luminosity estimated for individual nova outbursts .",
    "a nova outburst starts from the uppermost point of each line , which corresponds to the peak luminosity , and moves downward as the envelope mass decreases with time .",
    "the drag luminosity quickly decreases with time because the density around the orbit quickly decreases in wind solutions ( see figure [ density.evolution ] ) .",
    "the black lines depict three cases of classical novae .",
    "v838 her is one of the fastest classical novae , which occurred on a very massive wd , thus the envelope mass is very small .",
    "here we adopt the envelope structure taken from the light curve model of a 1.35 @xmath15 wd calculated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model 2 in their table 3 ) and a temporarily adopted 0.45 @xmath15 companion at the separation of @xmath104 . the lowest point of",
    "the line corresponds to the stage at which the companion emerges from the photosphere and the companion effects vanish after that .",
    "in the same way , we have estimated the drag luminosities for the moderately fast nova v1974 cyg ( a 1.05 @xmath15 wd model taken from * ? ? ? * ) with an 0.2 @xmath15 companion at @xmath105 , and for one of the slowest classical novae gq mus ( an 0.7 @xmath15 wd model taken from * ? ? ? * ) with an 0.1 @xmath15 ms companion at @xmath106 .",
    "here we adopt these parameters of the secondary , assuming they are in zero - age main sequence , which may not be accurate for each object .",
    "it is , however , enough for our purpose in estimating the drag luminosity , because it is not much affected by the choice of the secondary .",
    "v838 her and gq mus are the fastest and slowest classical novae , respectively .",
    "thus , many other classical novae may fall in between these two lines like v1974 cyg .",
    "we realize that the drag energy deposition is quite small . even in the very early phase of the outburst",
    ", the ratio reaches only a few to several percent .",
    "therefore , we reconfirm that the drag energy deposition does not contribute to the luminosity in classical novae .",
    "figure [ drag_efficiency ] also shows the case of a `` transition nova , '' which is a model for v723 cas ( see the next section for more details ) .",
    "the binary consists of an @xmath107 wd and an 0.4 @xmath15 ms companion .",
    "the contribution of drag luminosity is also very small throughout the outburst .",
    "the blue lines depict the case of helium nova outbursts .",
    "v445 pup is only the known helium nova for which we adopt a @xmath108 wd model from @xcite .",
    "the companion is assumed to be a 1.0 @xmath15 helium star and @xmath109 . for comparison",
    ", we also added another case of helium nova of a 1.0 @xmath15 wd ( model taken from * ? ? ? * ) , which has no observational counterpart but it is a theoretical purpose .",
    "for the companion , we assume an 0.8 @xmath15 helium star , and @xmath110 . as shown in figure [ drag_efficiency ] the drag luminosity is still very small .",
    "@xcite pointed out that two different types of nova evolutions , i.e. , one is the evolution with optically thick winds and the other is without , can be realized in slow novae of a certain range of wd masses , @xmath111 .",
    "for example , evolution of gq mus is explained by the sequence of optically thick wind solutions on a @xmath112 wd @xcite while the evolution of pu vul is described by a sequence of hydrostatic solutions on a @xmath113 wd @xcite .",
    "a remarkable difference between these two evolutions appears in the optical light curve @xcite .",
    "the wind - type novae have a sharp peak in the optical light curve , because massive optically thick wind carries away a large part of the envelope mass and the nova light curves decay quickly .",
    "on the other hand , no - optically thick wind novae have a long - lasted flat optical peak before the magnitude slowly decays , because the nova evolves very slowly and it stays at an extended low - temperature stage for a long time , which makes a long - lasted flat optical peak .",
    "@xcite presented an idea that a transition from the static evolution to the wind evolution could occur during an outburst .",
    "in such a case , the nova shows a flat optical peak with no indication of strong mass loss in the early phase of the outburst , followed by the decay like in normal novae with strong winds .",
    "@xcite further suggested that such a transition accompanies some activities like oscillatory behavior in brightness , because the internal structures of static / wind solutions are very different and the relaxation process may cause some oscillatory features .    such a transition , however , may need some triggering mechanism .",
    "pu vul has a flat optical peak that lasted for 8 yr .",
    "this indicates that the static evolution is stable in a timescale of @xmath114 yr .",
    "we suppose that a transition to a wind evolution was not triggered in pu vul because the structures of the static envelope are very different from those of the wind solutions .",
    "the static solution , however , changes its structure when a companion star disturbs the structure of a static envelope as shown in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "this encourages us to further investigate our idea that the transition from the static to wind solution occurred in some slow novae .",
    "figure [ 4nova ] shows the observational light curve of pu vul , v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr .",
    "pu vul showed a flat optical maximum that lasted for 8 yr , neglecting the deep eclipse at @xmath115 yr .",
    "the light curves of v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr are very similar to each other as already pointed out by many authors @xcite .",
    "these novae have multiple peaks , showing an oscillatory variation around a certain magnitude .",
    "after that the magnitudes declined rather smoothly .",
    "resemblances in spectral evolutions were also suggested .",
    "v723 cas shows very narrow emission / absorption lines in the spectra at the pre - maximum flat peak .",
    "the spectrum gradually changes to a pure absorption f - type supergiant before the optical maximum @xcite .",
    "note that pu vul also shows f - type supergiant spectra with pure narrow absorptions , which are interpreted as static evolution @xcite .",
    "after the optical maximum , v723 cas changes its spectrum to that of usual novae @xcite with many emission lines , some of which show a p cygni profile @xcite .",
    "after that it entered the nebular phase ( 645 - 677 days after the discovery ) .",
    "the spectral evolution of v5558 sgr before and after the maximum is also very similar to that of v723 cas @xcite . in the pre - maximum phase the nova shows a featureless f - type spectrum except narrow emission lines h@xmath18 and h@xmath116 and many weak absorption lines @xcite , which does not resemble to those of classical novae .",
    "fast hot winds ( fwhm 1150 1500 km  s@xmath6 ) appeared in the multi - peak episode suggest that mass ejection is associated to the brightening @xcite . during the decline phase ,",
    "v5558 sgr had entered the nebular phase and the spectra resemble to those of v723 cas @xcite .",
    "hr del also showed spectral evolution unlike classical novae @xcite .",
    "the early spectra before maximum were characterized by relatively narrow emission lines with p cygni absorption , and the spectral class of f0 .",
    "@xcite examined spectral evolution before maximum and concluded that optically thick winds unlikely occurred before maximum and that the photosphere is almost stationary .",
    "hr del showed several optical maxima which accompany discrete shell ejections @xcite .",
    "in the nebular phase , spectral evolution was alike to normal novae @xcite .",
    "these spectral changes in v723 cas , v5558 sgr , and hr del are consistent with our suggestion that these novae started its outburst from no optically thick wind evolution and , after the multi - peak phase , it changes into an optically thick wind evolution like usual novae .",

    "we see that these ` maximum phases ' last 200 - 400 days , which is much shorter than the flat maximum phase of pu vul ( 8 yr ) , but much longer than the orbital periods , so there is sufficient time for the companion to orbit many times around the wd before the envelope makes the transition .",
    "pu vul is a long period binary of @xmath121 days and the companion is an m type red giant ( rg ) . during the nova outburst",
    ", the wd envelope expands to @xmath122 , which is much smaller than the companion orbit @xcite .",
    "thus , the envelope structure is not affected by the companion . on the other hand , v723 cas ( @xmath123 days = 16.6 hr :",
    "* ) and hr del are close binaries and the companion is a dwarf .",
    "the orbital period of v5558 sgr is unknown , but suggested to be as short as normal classical novae , because a large outburst amplitude ( @xmath124 mag : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the companion is not an rg .",
    "therefore , in these three novae , the companion should have been deeply embedded in the nova envelope during the outburst .",
    "this is , again , very consistent with that pu vul ( a wide binary ) underwent a quiet evolution without strong winds throughout the outburst @xcite .",
    "no transition occurred in pu vul . on the other hand , v723 cas ,",
    "hr del , and v5558 sgr ( close binaries ) outbursted as a quiet evolution at the beginning , then changed into a wind evolution .",
    "the multiple peaks of these three nova light curves may be a relaxation process associated with the transition .",
    "the absence of multiple peaks in pu vul suggests no transition triggered , which may also support our idea .",
    "no indication of dust formation has been reported for all of the four novae as in table [ table_nova_parameters ] .",
    "this is consistent with our suggestion that no / weak optically thick winds occur in these novae , because dust is usually formed in massive winds like os and and dq her .",
    "the estimated wd mass is about 0.6 @xmath15 for all three novae , v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr .",
    "note that some works on slow novae mentioned that this 0.6 @xmath15 is a mass close to the lower limit of wds having strong nova outbursts as a thermonuclear runaway event @xcite .",
    "this argument is based on the calculation by @xcite with the old opacity .",
    "recent calculations with the opal opacity , however , show that thermonuclear runaway triggers nova outbursts even in much less massive wds , e.g. , in 0.4 and 0.6 @xmath15 wds @xcite , 0.4 @xmath15 wd @xcite , and 0.2 - 0.5 @xmath15 wds @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 is not the lower mass limit for a wd having nova outbursts .",
    "instead , we emphasize that @xmath113 is a lower boundary for a nova outburst having optically thick winds for solar composition @xcite .",
    "optically thick winds are weak , so it looks like a borderline classical nova @xcite .",
    "figure [ 4nova](a ) shows theoretical light curves of pu vul taken from @xcite , which consist of only static solutions .",
    "the theoretical curve well represents the observational light curve until @xmath125 yr , and then deviates after that when the nova enters the nebular phase .",
    "this theoretical curve represents blackbody emission from the wd photosphere and does not include the contribution from nebular emission lines outside the photosphere as well as of the rg companion which dominates in the later phase . therefore , the theoretical magnitude is much lower than the observation .",
    "we made composite theoretical light curves which mimic the light curves of v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr . here",
    ", we assume that the early phase is approximated by a sequence of static solutions and the later phase by a sequence of optically thick wind solutions .",
    "we made two trial light curves ; one is the model of 0.55 @xmath15 wd with the chemical composition of @xmath126 , and @xmath25 , and the other is an 0.6 @xmath15 wd with the solar composition @xmath127 and @xmath25 .",
    "we switched the solution from static to wind when the photospheric temperature increases to @xmath88 ( k)=3.89 for the 0.55 @xmath15 wd or to @xmath88 ( k)=3.87 for the 0.6 @xmath15 wd model .",
    "the effect of the companion is included in the static phase assuming an 0.4 @xmath15 ms , but not included in the wind phase for simplicity because of their small effects .",
    "no rotation effects are included .",
    "our trial light curves are depicted in figure [ 4nova ] ( b)-(d ) .",
    "red lines indicate the model of 0.55 @xmath15 wd and black lines the model of 0.6 @xmath15 wd .",
    "we applied the above two trial light curves to the three novae , v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr .",
    "the switching epoch from a static to wind evolution is indicated by an arrow . here",
    ", we assumed that the transition occurred @xmath128 days after the outburst . in the very beginning of outbursts ,",
    "the transition unlikely occurs because the envelope structure may have not yet been close enough to that of a wind solution ( see the red line solution in figure [ struc.norotation ] ) .",
    "once the envelope has extended to a giant size , it may take several dynamical timescale for the structure change from static to wind solution .",
    "the dynamical timescale is estimated to be @xmath129 days for @xmath130 cm and @xmath131 .",
    "note this timescale is roughly consistent with the magnitude variation of these novae which may associate with a relaxation process .",
    "apart from these oscillatory behaviors , our trial light curves are roughly consistent with the observed light curves of these three novae .",
    "figure [ density.evolution ] shows envelope structures corresponding to each stage of the composite light curve model of the 0.55 @xmath15 wd ( depicted by the red lines in figure [ 4nova ] ) .",
    "the red solid lines in figure [ density.evolution ] represent the static evolution in the flat maximum , the structure of which hardly changes during the flat maximum , and the black solid lines corresponds to the wind evolution in the decay phase ( after the arrow in figure [ 4nova ] ) .",
    "the green dashed lines indicate the model without the companion effects .",
    "we see that , in the presence of a companion , the transition from the static to wind evolution probably occurs , but may not occur without the companion effects because of a large difference between the envelope structures , that is , the green dashed line deviates largely from the rightmost black solid line .",
    "these two trial models adopt a parameter set of the wd mass , companion mass , chemical composition of the envelope , and the orbit , which may be close but not the exact values for each nova .",
    "we see , however , our trial light curves reproduce a characteristic properties of observed light curves ; the flat phase of static evolution followed by a smooth decline due to wind mass loss . if we choose another set of the parameters , we can also reproduce the flat peak by static solutions and the subsequent decline phase by wind solutions with a different decay timescale .",
    "the exact parameter fitting is not the aim of the present work , but we expect that we will find a suitable set of the parameters which reproduces the light curve as well as the other observational constraints .    in the present paper , we studied nova outbursts with a 1d approximation .",
    "the effects of a companion star are , however , highly aspherical , and the transition may occur in a different way in the different direction .",
    "this aspherical nature of the transition may relate to aspherical shapes of nova ejecta , but far beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "common envelope evolution with frictional effects by a companion star has been studied by multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in relation to the formation of close binaries .",
    "@xcite showed two - dimensional ( 2d ) evolutions of a common envelope , consisting of a 5 @xmath132 rg and an engulfed 1 @xmath132 ms star .",
    "their results demonstrate that frictional process is strong enough to drive a rapid mass outflow from the equatorial plane .",
    "eventually a large part of the envelope ( namely @xmath133 ) would be ejected and the companion would spiral in . a similar calculation but for a less massive 2 @xmath132 rg and the same 1 @xmath132 ms showed that frictional energy is large enough to eject the envelope , but the companion does not spiral in @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite for a binary of a 1.05 @xmath132 rg and an 0.6 @xmath132 ms companion showed that the companion orbit is much reduced by frictional effects of the massive 0.69 @xmath132 rg envelope . in these calculations ,",
    "the companion efficiently interacts with the massive envelope .",
    "this can be understood from equation ( [ equ_drag_simple ] ) . as the drag luminosity proportionally increases with the density",
    ", we expect very large drag luminosities in massive envelopes .",
    "@xcite calculated nova outbursts on a 1.0 @xmath132 wd with a @xmath134 envelope and an 0.46 @xmath132 ms companion .",
    "the author includes the drag luminosity in 1d approximation , essentially the same as the present work , but the companion s gravity is not included and the opacity is kramers law .",
    "the author found that the expansion velocity reaches @xmath1 300 km s@xmath6 , whereas 40 km s@xmath6 in the case without drag .",
    "the nova duration is not drastically shortened , i.e. , the drag luminosity is not effective in mass ejection .",
    "the main difference between ours and macdonald s ( 1980 ) is the opacity . with the opal opacity",
    "we have obtained the strong optically thick winds of high wind velocity ( @xmath135 km  s@xmath6 ) for a 1.0 @xmath132 wd and a short nova duration ( @xmath136 yr ) as observed . due to the low density at the orbit ,",
    "the drag luminosity is very small @xcite . from these reasons ,",
    "we regard that macdonald s ( 1980 ) results are not inconsistent with ours .",
    "@xcite presented 2d calculations of a common envelope phase of a classical nova on a 1.0 @xmath132 wd with a 0.5 @xmath132 companion and with an initially spherical envelope of mass @xmath137 .",
    "their calculation showed rapid mass outflows concentrated in the orbital plane .",
    "the mass loss rate reaches @xmath138 yr@xmath6 , corresponding to a timescale of 5 yr for mass ejection , but still being much longer than the observed timescales of novae .",
    "as already pointed out in our previous work @xcite , @xcite assumed adiabatic gas , in which the drag energy is effectively consumed to push matter upward against the gravity , and results in the strong acceleration of matter .",
    "if we adopt non - adiabatic gas , all the drag energy deposition can escape by diffusion process , as already shown in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "moreover , the authors adopted @xmath139 grid points in which frictional energy and angular momentum are deposited into four zones near the companion , which may be insufficient to follow the envelope evolution .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the adiabatic gas and low - resolution grid may be the reason why the authors get strong acceleration of matter concentrated in the equatorial plane while the drag luminosity is very small .    after these works done by @xcite and @xcite , the opal opacity appeared which causes strong acceleration of nova envelopes .",
    "we obtained large mass - loss rates and wind velocities as observed @xcite .",
    "once the optically thick winds occur , the drag luminosity has little effects ( see section [ sec_results ] and also section 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to summarize",
    ", we may conclude that the drag luminosity is effective in a massive envelope , but in a much less massive envelope , like realistic models of nova outbursts , the drag luminosity is entirely negligible . in other words , the common envelope evolution does not work in nova outbursts even if the companion is deeply embedded in the envelope .",
    "we assumed spherical ( 1d ) approximation of the drag energy deposition , in which the energy is deposited in a shell of radius @xmath22 and thickness of @xmath140 . in 2d approximation ,",
    "the energy is deposited in a torus of diameter of @xmath141 with cross section of @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the energy deposition per solid angle may be @xmath143 times larger than in our 1d approximation for the case of 0.55 @xmath15 wd and 0.4 @xmath15 ms companion .",
    "here we use the solution of @xmath88 ( k ) = 3.85 ( the model denoted by the black solid lines in figure [ struc.mcomp ] ) , in which @xmath144 cm and @xmath145 cm . in order to simulate this aspherical effect , we calculated a solution with enhanced drag luminosity by a factor of 2.8 .",
    "that is , we multiply the right - hand side of equation ( [ equ_drag ] ) by the factor of 2.8 .",
    "the resultant solution is shown in figure [ struc.mcomp ] by dashed lines .",
    "the increase of the drag luminosity causes increase of the radiation pressure , which results in the density decrease around the orbit .",
    "therefore , the resultant drag luminosity is @xmath146 erg  s@xmath6 , only 1.9 times the original one , @xmath147 erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "even if we further increase this factor to 10 as an extreme case , the drag luminosity deposition increases only by 3.4 times of the original one , to @xmath148 erg  s@xmath6 . with such enhanced energy deposition , the envelope structure changes , but this effects are relatively small , i.e. , less than the change of the companion mass of 0.1 @xmath15 as shown in figure [ struc.mcomp ] . in actual multidimensional case , the energy deposition due to frictional effects may escape by diffusion process into the pole ( rotation - axis ) directions , which makes the effects further smaller .",
    "therefore , our 1d approximation may not be far from the multi - dimensional approximations .",
    "we also assumed that the companion mass is distributed in a spherical shell around the orbit . in the extended envelope ,",
    "the photospheric radius is several tens times larger than the companion orbit as seen in figure [ struc.mcomp ] .",
    "thus , the 1d approximation may not be so bad in the outer part of the envelope . in the vicinity of the orbit ,",
    "2d approximation , this may be close to a time average of a 3d case , gives a stronger gravity which may be roughly estimated as    @xmath149    where @xmath150 cm .",
    "therefore , the companion gravity is much effective than our 1d case .",
    "the companion masses of v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr are not known , but if it is as low as @xmath151 , as in many classical novae , the enhanced gravity may roughly correspond to our massive model of @xmath152 .",
    "thus , envelope structure may not be largely different from that of our 1d model .",
    "it should be however noted that the center of rotation is the center of mass , which is different from the position of the wd . in this sense ,",
    "the center of our 1d approximation ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) switches from the wd center in the inner part to the center of mass in the outer part .",
    "the intermediate region between them is an interacting region with the companion , which is highly aspherical .",
    "therefore , our 1d model is a rather crude approximation to this intermediate region , which is not easily justified by our 1d model .",
    "we need a full 3-d hydrodynamic simulation including radiative diffusion to obtain a definite conclusion to the transition .",
    "we also assumed a simple form of angular momentum distribution in the extended envelope . here",
    "we examine how this approximation affects the envelope structure , assuming a different rotation law .",
    "figure [ drag ] shows a trial angular velocity distribution ( by the orange solid line ) that represents co - rotation with the wd , i.e. , @xmath154 , in the inner part of the companion ( @xmath155 , i.e. , @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath156 ) , and specific angular momentum conservation in the outside of the binary ( @xmath157 , i.e. , @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath158 ) .",
    "in the intermediate region we connect these two laws in an arbitrary form as shown in the figure .",
    "if the nova envelope expands very slowly , it is spun up by the interaction with the companion and gets angular momentum @xmath1591.7@xmath160 per unit mass ( see numerical simulations , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this may be the maximum value for actual nova outbursts , because expanding speed is not infinitely small ( in v723 cas , the rising timescale is one week ) . if no further acceleration occurs outside , the angular velocity decreases due to the specific angular momentum conservation .",
    "we here assume that the angular velocity decreases according to the specific angular momentum conservation , @xmath161 at @xmath162 .",
    "figure [ drag ] also shows effective mass @xmath57 corresponding to the trial angular momentum distribution ( the dash - three - dotted line ) .",
    "this effective mass @xmath57 is constant ( @xmath163 ) at @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath164 as in the other models because the second term of equation ( [ equ_f_def ] ) is small , and we have @xmath165 .",
    "this means that the angular momentum at the wd surface is so small , that the results are independent of the initial rotation law of the wd envelope . on the other hand",
    ", the effective mass @xmath57 varies corresponding to the change of @xmath28 in the middle part and quickly rises as @xmath28 decreases in the outer part ( @xmath63 ( cm ) @xmath166 ) .",
    "figure [ struc.compari ] shows the envelope structure corresponding to the trial rotation law by the orange dash - three - dotted lines .",
    "the distributions of the temperature and density in the inner part are very close to those of rapid rotation ( @xmath167 0.383 and 0.45 : red solid and purple dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "as explained previously , a reduced effective gravity due to centrifugal force causes smaller eddington luminosity in the outer part , and thus , a smaller diffusive luminosity .",
    "therefore , the envelope mass redistributes to balance with a wider local super - eddington region . as a result , the envelope structure becomes closer to the one without companion , although the structure is very different in the outer part due to irregular variation of @xmath57 .    from these results",
    ", we say that our rotation law defined in section [ centrifugal_force ] may be too simple but still useful in a qualitative study of possible transition from static to wind evolution of slow novae .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "we present an idea of a transition from static evolution to optically thick wind evolution in low - mass wds ( @xmath168 ) . in close binaries , if the effects of a companion are included , the structure of a static envelope becomes close to that of a wind solution .",
    "this makes it easy to trigger the transition . in wide binaries ,",
    "the effects of a companion are not important , and the structure is very different from that of the wind solution .",
    "this makes the transition difficult .",
    "a transition from static to wind evolution could occur in slow novae such as v723 cas , hr del , and v5558 sgr .",
    "the transition can explain the spectral evolutions of these novae as well as their characteristic light curves .",
    "violent activities like oscillatory behaviors in optical light curves are regarded as some relaxation processes associated with the transition .",
    "the presence of a companion deep inside the nova envelopes triggers this transition , which is consistent with the orbital separations in short - period binaries like v723 cas . on the other hand ,",
    "no transition occurs in long - period binaries like pu vul because of no presence of a companion in the nova envelopes .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful and valuable comments that improved the manuscript .",
