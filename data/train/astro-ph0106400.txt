    "it has long been difficult to estimate with confidence the mass - loss rates from cool dwarf stars . on the basis of x - ray emission ,",
    "there is clear evidence that coronae exist around many cool dwarfs .",
    "based on analogy with the sun , it is likely that thermally driven winds emerge from these coronae . however , the column densities of these winds are so small that direct detection is usually very difficult .",
    "the thermally driven wind is , however , not the only means by which the sun loses mass .",
    "there are also episodic ejections of material into the wind .",
    "these coronal mass ejections ( cme s ) contribute on average some 16% to the solar - wind mass flux at solar maximum @xcite .",
    "the cme s occur when magnetic configurations in the corona can no longer find an equilibrium with the ambient plasma .",
    "because cme s are intrinsically magnetic in nature , it is expected that in stars where magnetic activity levels exceed those in the sun , cme s should be larger in scale , and occur more frequently , than in the sun .",
    "in particular , lower - main - sequence stars belonging to the category of flare stars are sites of particularly high magnetic activity .",
    "the energy released in flares on such stars may exceed by several orders of magnitude the energy that is released in the largest solar flares .",
    "in such magnetically active stars , we anticipate that cme s might contribute significantly more than 16% to the total mass flux . in this paper",
    ", we report direct spectroscopic evidence that points strongly to the existence of cme s from a well - known magnetically active star .",
    "our target is the late - type flare star in the v471  tauri binary system , a member of the hyades star cluster .",
    "v471  tau is an eclipsing binary with a period of 0.52  day , consisting of a cool main - sequence star ( dk2 ) and a hot white dwarf ( da1.5 ) .",
    "orbiting at only @xmath33.4 stellar radii from the dk star , the hot white dwarf ( wd ) provides a superb uv background source for probing the environment above the cool star s surface . in 1986 ,",
    "x - rays from the wd were found to be rotationally modulated with a period of 9.25 minutes ( jensen et al .",
    "1986 ) , and it was hypothesized that the modulation might be due to accretion of heavy elements onto a magnetic polar cap on the wd .",
    "direct spectroscopic confirmation of the accretion hypothesis was obtained when sion et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovered a rotationally modulated , zeeman - split uv metallic absorption line in the photospheric spectrum of the wd .",
    "the material that accretes onto the wd in v471 tau is presumed to originate in a wind from the dk2 companion .",
    "reliable evidence that the k2 dwarf is magnetically active is provided by optical spectroscopic and photometric flares which are  common and intense \" ( young 1976 ; young , rottler , & skumanich 1991 ; see also beavers et al .  1979 ) , by x - ray flares ( young et al.1983 ) , and by radio flaring activity ( patterson , caillault , & skillman 1993 ; nicholls & storey 1999 ) .",
    "the high levels of magnetic activity in this particular k2 dwarf are attributed to fast rotation : the star is tidally locked to the short orbital period of the binary .",
    "this leads to an angular velocity for the k2 dwarf , @xmath6 , that is some 50 times greater than the solar value , @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", dynamo action is expected to be much more efficient than in the sun .    associated with enhanced magnetic activity",
    ", we expect an increase in the efficiency of mass ejections in the form of cme s . in support of this",
    ", we note that young ( 1976 ) has pointed out a possible connection between mass - loss events in v471 tau and episodes of activity on the k2 star .",
    "moreover , transient absorptions in in _ iue _ spectra of v471  tau were reported by mullan et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and interpreted as evidence for cme s . based on the line strengths , mullan et al .  estimated the mass - loss rate associated with the cme s to be at least @xmath8 .",
    "eclipse timings show that the orbital period of v471  tau changes with time ( tunca et al .  1979 ) .",
    "if the period changes are secular in nature and are due simply to mass loss from one component , the rate of period change may be used to determine mean mass - loss rates .",
    "this argument led to an estimate of @xmath9 of order @xmath10 for v471  tau @xcite .",
    "however , it is alternatively possible that the apparent period changes are strictly periodic and are due to light - travel - time effects in a triple system , as has been argued by ibanolu  et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and guinan & ribas ( 2001 ) .",
    "yet another possibility , perhaps the most likely , is that the orbital period modulations in v471  tau and other active binaries arise from the magnetic activity .",
    "a specific mechanism is the gravitational interaction between the orbit and variations in shape of the active component in the system , as discussed by , e.g. , applegate ( 1992 ) , who argues that it is plausible for the case of v471  tau . in view of these alternatives ,",
    "the cited value of @xmath9 is probably a gross overestimate . in a later section",
    ", we will support this conclusion using an independent line of argument : we will show that the mass - loss rate from the k2 dwarf can not exceed @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    ", we report on uv observations of v471  tau obtained with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "the spectra show clear evidence of transient absorptions in the 1206.51  @xmath0 resonance line of , which we attribute to cme s passing in front of the wd component .",
    "the line is representative of hotter material than , and we therefore expect that the line more nearly reflects the coronal conditions in v471  tau . to the extent",
    "that this expectation is valid , the present study provides a more reliable analysis of cme properties than that based on the earlier _ iue _ data @xcite .",
    "we note that v471  tau is a detached binary , in which neither star fills its roche lobe .",
    "therefore , the mechanism that drives mass loss from the k2 dwarf has nothing to do with roche - lobe overflow . instead , the mass loss from the dk2 star must depend for its origin on the same processes to which a single star has access .",
    "for that reason , we may meaningfully consider processes that are known to operate in the sun in our attempt to interpret our observations of v471  tau .",
    "the ghrs observations that form the basis of the present paper have been described in detail by sion et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and obrien et al .",
    "the observing was optimized primarily to determine the radial velocities of the wd component , and also to search for spectroscopic variations on the rotational period of the wd ; our discovery of transient cme events was thus entirely serendipitous .",
    "briefly , in 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 , in the course of 12 _ hst _ visits , 128 individual spectra of v471 tau were obtained centered on the wavelength of ly@xmath2 . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the hot wd completely dominates the spectrum , aside from a narrow chromospheric ly@xmath2 emission line from the k  dwarf .",
    "the dispersion was 0.07    diode@xmath12 , and the wavelength range covered was 36   , broad enough to include , by chance , the 1206  @xmath0 resonance line . in 1994 - 95",
    ", there were eight _ hst _ visits , during which each individual sub - exposure had a duration of 127  s , chosen in order to resolve the 9.25-minute rotational period of the wd into four time bins . during each visit ,",
    "a series of 16 sub - exposures was taken , lasting ( including overheads between sub - exposures ) a total of 36.3  min . during the four visits in 1993 ,",
    "the sub - exposures were 101  s , and the total observation duration per visit was 29.0  min .",
    "each visit was planned to occur near orbital quadratures , i.e. , at the maximum projected separation between the wd and the dk2 components as seen from earth .",
    "the total time that the star was under observation during the 12 visits was 6.8  hours .",
    "transient absorptions in @xmath131206  @xmath0 were seen twice during the course of the observations .",
    "1 shows a pictorial representation of the spectra obtained during the more dramatic event , which occurred on 1994 oct 20 .",
    "sixteen individual 127-s exposures are stacked in fig .  1 from top to bottom in order of increasing time , in order to simulate a single - trailed photographic spectrogram .",
    "very broad photospheric ly@xmath2 absorption wings extend across the spectrum , at constant strength in all 16 spectra , and there are emission features from the dk chromosphere and a deep interstellar ly@xmath2 absorption centered in the core of the hydrogen line . in the top four spectra , there is no sign of the line , but this line appeared suddenly in absorption in the fifth spectrum .",
    "the absorption was strong as soon as it appeared , and it remained comparably strong throughout the remainder of the 36-min series .",
    "this observation was taken at orbital phase  0.82 ( wd receding and dk2 approaching ) . when the next exposures at the same quadrature were obtained 3 days later",
    ", the absorption had disappeared . as noted above , at this orbital phase ,",
    "the projected separation of the stars is at its maximum of about 3.4  dk radii ( obrien et al .",
    "2001 ) .    a second , similar but less pronounced transient event ( not illustrated here )",
    "was detected near the end of another visit on 1994 oct 17 , at orbital phase  0.77 .",
    "this transient made a sudden appearance in the 14th sub - exposure , and remained detectable during the final three sub - exposures of this visit .",
    "when the next visit at the same orbital phase occurred 2 days later , the feature had again disappeared .    in fig .  2 , we plot the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line versus time during the 36  minutes of observation on 1994 oct 20 .",
    "the ew was below detectability ( @xmath140  m ) during the first four sub - exposures .",
    "then , in the fifth sub - exposure , the line appeared at ew @xmath14110  m@xmath0 .",
    "the line grew in strength to a maximum of @xmath14275  m@xmath0 in the eighth sub - exposure , and then fluctuated approximately between these limits for the remainder of the visit .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of the line during the 1994 oct 20 absorption event ( determined by summing the 12 spectra showing the line , and measuring the wavelength of the line center ) was @xmath15 . at this time , the center - of - mass velocity of the wd was @xmath16 , according to the spectroscopic orbit of obrien et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    for the event on 1994 oct 17 the radial velocity was @xmath17 , as compared with the wd velocity of @xmath18 .",
    "thus both transient features had radial velocities within about @xmath19@xmath20 of the wd radial velocity .",
    "this indicates that , in the reference frame which rotates with the orbital motion , the transient absorber crossed the line of sight to the wd almost exactly transversely .",
    "we note that the sudden , strong absorption feature we discuss here is distinct from the much weaker and broader absorption line arising in the photospheric surface spot on the wd discovered by sion et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : the velocities are significantly different ( note that a photospheric line would have an additional gravitational redshift of @xmath21 ) , a surface  patch \" of ions would be rotationally modulated on the 9.25-min wd rotation period , and a photospheric line would show zeeman splitting ( see sion et  al . ) .",
    "we will now discuss the transient absorption events in terms of cme s passing in front of the wd .",
    "the facts that both of the transient features appeared suddenly , were not present in the immediately preceding spectra , and then persisted for the rest of the observation , imply that the absorbing material must have covered the entire disk of the wd within a time interval @xmath22 of less than the exposure time of 127  s.    with a wd radius , @xmath23 , of @xmath24  km ( obrien et al .",
    "2001 ) , this requires that the absorbing material must have traversed our line of sight to the wd at a projected speed , @xmath25 , of at least @xmath26 .",
    "given the suddenness with which the feature appeared , the true velocity of the absorber , @xmath27 , almost certainly exceeded @xmath28 , perhaps by a considerable factor .      the transient absorption on 1994 oct 20 persisted until the end of the 36-min observing sequence ( see figs .  1 and  2 )",
    "thus the duration of the absorption event , @xmath29 , was at least 1600  s. given that the absorbing feature moved across the line of sight to the wd with a speed of @xmath27 , we conclude that the extent of the absorber in projection , @xmath30 , was at least @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32  km .",
    "thus , the absorbing feature had a transverse dimension , @xmath33 , that exceeded @xmath3@xmath34 .    the dk2 star in v471  tau has a radius that is slightly less than that of the sun : @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "thus , the above lower limit on @xmath33 in terms of the dk star radius is of order @xmath36 .      only those cme s that emerge from the k dwarf in v471  tau and",
    "pass in front of the wd will create absorption features in its spectrum .",
    "moreover , the two transient features that we did detect during the 6.8  hours of observing were seen to move nearly transversely across the wd line of sight in the orbital reference frame .",
    "the question we need to address is this : under what launch conditions will a cme from the k dwarf satisfy the above conditions ?    to answer this question , we must consider the orbital mechanics of an object that moves in the gravitational field of a rotating binary with mass parameter @xmath37 , where conventionally @xmath38 is taken to refer to the more massive component .",
    "thus for the case of v471  tau we take @xmath38 to refer to the mass of the dk star and @xmath39 to refer to the mass of the wd .",
    "obrien et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have used the same ghrs observations described here to determine the spectroscopic orbit of the wd component , and have derived masses of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we thus have @xmath42 .    using the notation of gould ( 1957 ) for the restricted three - body problem",
    ", we adopt a three - dimensional @xmath43 frame of reference rotating with the orbit , with the @xmath44-axis chosen to lie along the line of centers and directed from the dk primary to the wd secondary ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the sense of rotation is denoted by the arrows close to the @xmath45 symbol in fig .",
    "3 . with the origin at the center of gravity ,",
    "the primary and secondary stars are fixed at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to motions in the orbital @xmath48 plane .",
    "the equations that we integrate are @xmath49 @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 . in these equations ,",
    "the unit of distance is the separation , @xmath52 , between the stars ( @xmath53 ) , and the unit of time is such that @xmath54 .",
    "the unit of velocity thus becomes @xmath55 , or about @xmath56 .",
    "following gould , we checked the numerical accuracy of each integration by evaluating jacobi s constant , and found it to be invariant to within one part in @xmath57 after 100 time units .",
    "each integration starts by launching a  test particle \" radially outward from the surface of the k2 dwarf ( with radius 0.29 in the normalized units used here ) .",
    "the launch point is chosen to lie on the equator , at a longitude @xmath58 relative to the line of centers .",
    "because of the complicated gravitational potential , the trajectory is very sensitive to both @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the initial launch velocity . for examples of the great variety of trajectories that can occur , see gould ( 1959 ) , especially her fig .  8",
    "in which @xmath60 has the value 0.5 , close to that of v471  tau . if we knew how to make allowance for magnetic forces , we would probably find trajectories of even greater complexity .",
    "however , in the present study , we restrict attention to the mechanics that are controlled by gravitation and rotation alone , which we can characterize with high precision in v471  tau where the stellar and orbital parameters are well known . ) , whereas centrifugal forces increase in strength ( @xmath61 ) . as a result ,",
    "the cme in effect becomes magnetically decoupled from the k star at a relatively short distance from the star . beyond that point",
    ", the trajectory is expected to be dominated by gravitation and rotation . for our present purposes",
    ", we assume that the decoupling of the cme occurs so close to the k star that , apart from controlling the launch velocity , magnetic fields have no significant effects on the subsequent motion . ]",
    "we plot in fig .  3 a series of trajectories for ejections with a range of @xmath59 values and three different launch points on the dk surface .",
    "shown as solid lines are launches from the sub - wd point ( longitude @xmath62 ) , with @xmath59 ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 ( i.e. , @xmath3380@xmath63 for the parameters of v471  tau ) . as noted , the plot is in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "the line of sight ( los ) to the earth at the quadrature where the wd is receding from us is shown .",
    "the trajectories launched from the sub - wd point all pass close to the wd , and are favorable for creating absorption in the wd spectrum at this quadrature .",
    "moreover , in all of these cases the velocity of the particle is almost entirely in the @xmath44-direction , i.e. , transverse to our los .",
    "( specifically , all of the solid lines plotted in fig .",
    "3 have @xmath64 of less than @xmath190.07 units of velocity during the wd occultation . for the parameters of v471 tau",
    ", this corresponds to less than @xmath19@xmath65 . )",
    "this family of trajectories thus agrees quite well with the velocity properties actually observed for our two transient events .",
    "moreover , such trajectories would not be able to produce absorption events at orbital phase 0.25 , again in agreement with the fact that we did not observe any transients at that phase .",
    "it should also be noted that these trajectories all leave the system after passing in front of the wd , i.e. , they represent mass that is lost from the k  star and from the binary .",
    "several optical observers , including young , skumanich , & paylor ( 1988 ) and bois , lanning , & mochnacki ( 1991 ) , have reported that h@xmath2 emission tends to be strong when v471  tau is near orbital phase 0.5 ( i.e. , when the sub - wd point faces the earth ) .",
    "this might suggest that there is enhanced activity near the sub - wd point , which would favor launches from near this region on the star . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong emission is probably related as well to the uv irradiation of the facing hemisphere by the hot wd . in any case , as noted by young , rottler , & skumanich ( 1991 ) , the h@xmath2 profiles are highly complex and variable , even at the same orbital phase , so that variable surface activity is clearly present over and above the constant effect of irradiation .",
    "it is possible to find other launch points and velocities that also lead to trajectories passing in front of the wd at phase 0.75 .",
    "3 , for example , shows ( as dotted lines ) a family of launches from @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , 1.8 , and 2.0 , several of which do pass in front of the wd as desired .",
    "however , launches from @xmath68 , shown as dot - dash lines in fig",
    ".  3 , do not pass in front of the wd as seen from earth at phase 0.75 .",
    "in order to evaluate the probability of cme detections such as those we observed , we searched in @xmath58 and @xmath59 to determine those launch conditions that give rise to occultations in which @xmath64 is no larger than @xmath190.07 . for purposes of occultation",
    ", we allow the ejecta to have a finite extent corresponding to the lower limit mentioned above ( @xmath3@xmath69 ) : as a result , occultation extends from slightly before to slightly after the instant at which the center of the ejecta transits the wd .",
    "we demand that @xmath64 have values in the range @xmath190.07 at some point during this extended occultation .",
    "results of this search are shown in fig .  4 , in",
    "which combinations of @xmath58 and @xmath59 that satisfy these criteria are plotted as @xmath70 s . for sufficiently low @xmath59",
    ", the ejecta do not escape from the k dwarf at all ; they simply fall back onto its surface . in the v471  tau system , this happens at @xmath71 , shown by a vertical line in fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath59 in excess of @xmath72 , we find that launches satisfy our criteria over a certain range of @xmath58 values .",
    "the limits of this range are outlined roughly by dashed lines : outside the dashed lines , the launches are not relevant in the present context .",
    "the allowed launch range @xmath73 is broadest ( some 50@xmath74 wide ) for @xmath751.6 . for very fast @xmath59 , the ejecta move past the wd at an increasingly large angle , such that it becomes difficult to satisfy the @xmath64 criterion . as a result , only a narrow launch window ( some 8@xmath76 wide ) is possible for @xmath77 .",
    "it is true that , in the rotating frame , the paths of most cme s eventually wrap around the binary : therefore many trajectories may in principle eventually intercept the los to the wd .",
    "however , this generally happens at such a great distance from the wd that the chances of occultation ( as seen by us ) are much smaller than in the closest approaches shown in figs .  3 - 4 , and",
    "also the gas density may well have fallen significantly at that time .",
    "if cme s with the optimal velocities @xmath781.6 ( i.e. , @xmath3450@xmath79 ) were ejected uniformly at all longitudes around the equator of the k2 dwarf , the probability that we would detect absorption in the wd near phase 0.75 would be very roughly @xmath800.2 .",
    "thus , for every cme that is in principle detectable , we will miss @xmath817 others because they are launched from the ",
    "wrong \" longitude .",
    "@xmath82 will be even larger than this if @xmath59 is outside the optimal range .",
    "we will also miss cme s that are ejected out of the orbital plane . in our computer modelling",
    ", we considered only ejections from zero latitude .",
    "because of the finite extent of @xmath33 , however , an ejection at non - zero latitude @xmath13 could still occult the wd if @xmath83 . with @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , @xmath13 exceeds @xmath3@xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath33 were @xmath14@xmath87 , @xmath13 would be of order @xmath88 .",
    "thus , if the cme s are also launched from random latitudes , for every cme that is detectable , we may miss @xmath8911 because they are launched from the ",
    "wrong \" latitude .",
    "these are upper limits on @xmath90 , since coriolis forces eventually force even high - latitude ejections to approach the equatorial plane , so that occultation may eventually be possible . as a result ,",
    "a range of crudely 310 is not implausible for @xmath90 in the v471  tau system .",
    "thus , assuming randomly distributed launch points , for every ejection that we  catch \" in absorption in v471  tau at phase 0.75 , we  miss \" at least @xmath9170 cme s .",
    "of course , it is difficult to guarantee that cme s emerge from the k dwarf in a spherically symmetric manner .",
    "if the emergence of cme s is non - spherically symmetric , the above estimates of @xmath92 will be modified . in the case of the sun , where activity is confined to low latitudes , most cme s",
    "are observed to be launched within @xmath93 of the equator @xcite .",
    "if this tendency were to occur in v471  tau , the above estimates of @xmath92 should be reduced by factors of about 1.5 .",
    "however , it is not obvious that the latitudinal distribution of activity on a rapidly rotating k star is the same as on the sun : for example , such a star may differ from the sun in having polar spots and in having differential rotation of opposite sign from that in the sun ( e.g. , vogt & hatzes 1991 ) . on a star with polar spots , the cme s",
    "might even be ejected preferentially in the polar direction : in such a case , @xmath92 would be even larger than we estimated above . indeed , doppler mapping of the dk star in v471  tau by ramseyer , hatzes , & jablonski ( 1995 ) does show spots on the surface of the star at high latitudes .",
    "two transients were detected in v471 tau in the course of 6.8 hours of our ghrs observations .",
    "this corresponds to a mean observable transient rate of @xmath147 per day .",
    "correcting for the geometric factors ( @xmath92 ) in the previous subsection , and assuming that the transient rate that we observed is typical of the time - averaged rate , the total rate of cme emergence from the k star is , very crudely , of order 100500 per day .",
    "we note that when cme s emerge from the sun , the outward velocities have lower limits of about @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "this is close to the lower limit we have estimated on @xmath27 in v471  tau .",
    "however , the mean velocities of solar cme s at various epochs are considerably higher , 350@xmath95 @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we note that the optimal launch velocities of cme s in v471  tau ( as far as being able to create with high probability absorptions in the wd spectrum similar to those we observed ) was found to be @xmath31.41.6 velocity units , or about 450@xmath79 ( cf.fig .  4 ) .",
    "this overlaps with the high end of the solar cme range of velocities .",
    "as regards the sizes of cme s in the sun , we note that the mean latitudinal extents of solar cme s at various epochs are found to be 42@xmath96 @xcite . very few events are larger in angular extent than @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "thus solar cme s near their source in most cases have linear dimensions that are comparable to @xmath98 , with very few having larger linear dimensions .",
    "if a scaling by stellar radius applies to cme s from the k star in v471  tau , then @xmath33 should not exceed about @xmath87 in linear extent .",
    "this limit on cme dimensions does not disagree with the observational constraints discussed above .",
    "we note that inhomogeneity in solar cme s is relevant to the v471  tau case .",
    "the internal structure of cme s is far from uniform .",
    "for example , two cme s reported by wood et al .",
    "( 1999 ) exhibited highly striated interiors , with many different strands of material apparently intersecting one another in complicated patterns .",
    "each strand had a width of at least @xmath99  km , and was presumably associated with a different flux rope in the original magnetic configuration . if strands of similar widths are present in cme s from the k2 star in v471  tau , then each individual strand could cover the wd ( with diameter less than @xmath99  km ) as a separate event .",
    "the presence of multiple strands could explain why the absorption line fluctuates significantly with time once the event has begun , as shown in fig .  2 .    in summary",
    ", it seems that in terms of speed , dimension , and internal complexity , the transient absorbing features in v471  tau are not inconsistent with the properties of solar cme s .",
    "below , we shall see that in terms of overall mass , the feature also resembles a solar cme .",
    "however , for the sun , even near solar maximum , the rate of cme s does not exceed about 3 per day : near solar minimum , the number is closer to 1 per day @xcite . the rate of cme ejections from the active v471  tau k dwarf evidently exceeds the solar value by a considerable factor , roughly 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "another measure of the level of magnetic activity on a star involves the size and/or number of cool spots on the surface . in the sun , as the number of spots waxes and wanes in the course of the 11-year cycle , the largest spots and faculae have areas of order @xmath100 times the visible disk area . as a result of non - exact cancellation between spot darkenings and facular brightenings ,",

    "in contrast to these small variations , the brightness of the k dwarf in v471  tau varies by as much as 0.2  mag over timescales of tens of years ( ibanolu  1978 ; tunca et al .  1979 ; ibanolu  et al .",
    "if these variations can be ascribed to waxing and waning of spots / faculae analogous to the solar activity cycle , then the areal dimensions of spots / faculae on the k dwarf in v471 tau must exceed those in the sun by factors of 200 - 400 .",
    "in fact , radiometric calculations presented by obrien et al .  ( 2001 ) , along with direct doppler imaging by ramseyer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , confirm that about 25% of the surface area of the star is covered by starspots , some 250 times that of the sun .",
    "we note that our estimates of the excess of the cme rates above solar values ( 100500 ) and our estimates of the excess of spottedness above solar values ( @xmath3250 ) are reasonably similar .",
    "is such a high level of activity possible in the context of dynamo activity ? to answer this , we recall that the angular velocity @xmath6 of the k2 dwarf in v471  tau is some 50 times larger than the angular velocity of the sun .",
    "presumably the level of magnetic activity is determined by the maximum magnetic field strength on the surface of the star .",
    "now , in a turbulent dynamo , the amplitude of the maximum field depends on the mechanism that gives rise to non - linear limiting .",
    "with one particular choice of limiting mechanism , the maximum field strength is predicted to scale as @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "this prediction suggests that magnetic fields in the k2 dwarf in v471  tau may exceed the solar values by a factor of @xmath3350 .",
    "we suggest that the excesses in cme rate and in spotted activity in v471  tau are related to this dynamo - related excess in maximum field strength .    what effects might arise from these strong fields",
    "? presumably the coronal heating process will be highly efficient . in the sun ,",
    "enhanced magnetic field strengths , @xmath102 , are correlated with enhanced coronal densities , @xmath103 . because of this correlation , the alfven speed @xmath104 does not necessarily vary greatly from one region of the corona to another . now , when a cme is created through loss of magnetic equilibrium , the velocity of ejection may be related to the local alfven speed . in such a scenario ,",
    "the speeds of cme s may exhibit a well - defined mean in spite of large variations of @xmath102 value from one part of the corona to another .",
    "analogously , the presence of strong fields in v471  tau does not exclude the possibility that @xmath105 is comparable to solar @xmath105 .",
    "this may explain why the optimal ejection speed in v471 tau overlaps with the mean range of solar cme speeds .",
    "in this section , we use the properties of the transient absorption features to set limits on the cme mass - loss rate from the k2 dwarf .",
    "we wish to estimate @xmath106 , the number of silicon nuclei per @xmath107 along the line of sight during a transient absorption . to be specific , we consider the equivalent width of the transient absorption in the 1206  @xmath0 line at the time of maximum absorption : @xmath108  @xmath0 ( see fig .  2 )",
    "to convert this to a column density , we assume that conditions are optically thin ; this seems to be a reasonable approximation in view of the relative weakness of the transient absorption . on the linear portion of the curve of growth",

    ", we find @xmath116 .",
    "the total column density of silicon nuclei , @xmath106 , exceeds @xmath110 by a factor @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the fractional abundance of silicon in the ground state .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath118 is related to the temperature of the source region from which the cme material emerged .    assuming a cosmic silicon abundance of @xmath119 by number @xcite",
    ", we find that the column density of hydrogen in the transient absorption is @xmath120 .",
    "denoting the linear extent of the absorbing material @xmath33 , we recall from  3.2 that its value is at least @xmath3@xmath121 .",
    "the volumetric number density of hydrogens , @xmath122 , in the absorbing material is thus given by @xmath123 .",
    "we shall find below ( see  4.5 ) that it is possible to set a lower limit of @xmath3@xmath124 on the value of @xmath118 . if @xmath125 , we can therefore obtain an approximate upper limit on the number density of the absorbing material of @xmath126 .",
    "is this limit reasonable for a detached binary system ? to answer that , we note that in semi - detached binaries ( where , due to roche - lobe overflow , denser gas streams are expected ) , gas densities are found to be in the range @xmath127@xmath128 @xcite .",
    "these are , as expected , larger than the upper limit we obtain here for the detached v471  tau system .      with @xmath129 protons per @xmath130 , and linear extent of @xmath33 ,",
    "the total mass of the 1994 oct 20 transient absorber , @xmath131 , was of order @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the proton mass . using the above estimates",
    ", we find @xmath134 .",
    "if we again assume @xmath135 ( analogous to the largest solar cme s ) , and consider that @xmath136 , then the cme mass for the event seen in v471  tau must have exceeded @xmath137  g.    is this mass reasonable for a cme ? to answer this , we note that in the case of the solar corona , the mass distribution of cme s has an exponential distribution with typical scale @xmath138  g @xcite .",
    "thus , once again , it is noteworthy that a cme parameter in the sun has a comparable value in v471  tau .",
    "the limiting mass of a cme from a stellar corona is presumably determined by the ability of the plasma and magnetic field of the corona to store energy only up to some limiting value @xcite . in v471",
    "tau , the levels of magnetic activity are larger than solar , but it is less clear what the plasma properties might be .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether or not the atmosphere in v471  tau is in principle capable of storing larger energies than in the solar case .      combining our estimates of the numbers of ejections per day ( @xmath3100500 ) from the k dwarf with @xmath131 from the preceding subsection",
    ", we find the cme mass - loss rate in v471  tau to be of order @xmath139@xmath140    how does this compare to the rate at which the sun loses mass in the form of cme s ? according to jackson & howard ( 1993 ) , the maximally active sun ejects cme mass at a rate of @xmath141 .",
    "thus the cme mass - loss rate in v471  tau is comparable to or somewhat larger than that in the sun if most of the si is in the form of , or could greatly exceed the solar rate if @xmath118 is low .",
    "we thus see that , although all of the input numbers are uncertain , the principal unknown factor in determining the actual cme mass - loss rate in v471  tau is the numerical value of @xmath118 .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of this value .",
    "the value of @xmath118 depends on the electron temperature , @xmath142 , at the place of cme origin . in an expanding wind ,",
    "ionization states are  frozen in \" within a short radial distance of the stellar surface .",
    " frozen - in \" conditions set in at the radial distance where the expansion time of the wind becomes shorter than the ionization time - scale @xcite . beyond that radial distance , even if the gas cools as the cme expands during its outward motion , the ionization states will not come into local equilibrium .",
    "we refer to ionization equilibria calculations under chromospheric / coronal conditions ( e.g. , arnaud & rothenflug 1985 , their table  iv ) to determine the fractional abundance of at various temperatures .",
    "( at our level of approximation , we ignore the small fraction , generally @xmath125% , of ions that are in excited states . )",
    "if the material in the transient absorber started in the corona of the k star , where electron temperatures are at least @xmath143  k , then @xmath118 would be miniscule : arnaud & rothenflug s ( 1985 ) table does not extend beyond @xmath144 for , but if we perform an ( admittedly gross ) extrapolation from the last three entries in their table , we find that at @xmath145  k , @xmath118 may be of order @xmath146 .",
    "if the material started out in the low transition region between corona and chromosphere , at ( say ) 140,000  k , then @xmath147 . the highest abundance of occurs at electron temperatures of @xmath330,000  k , where @xmath148 .",
    "finally , if the material started off in the chromosphere ( at @xmath310,000  k ) then @xmath149 .    for @xmath150 , and @xmath151 , the cme mass - loss rate from the results of the previous subsection would be ( 3@xmath152 or ( 5@xmath153 . to get fairly reasonable agreement with the estimated lower limit of @xmath154@xmath155 from _ iue _ observations of absorption @xcite , we would need @xmath1560.025 .",
    "these limits on @xmath118 correspond to an origin either in the transition region ( at temperatures above @xmath3100,000  k ) , or conceivably in the chromosphere ( at temperatures below @xmath314,000  k ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the cme material in v471 tau emerged from a truly coronal structure with a very low @xmath118 , then the mean mass - loss rate in cme s could be several orders of magnitude larger , possibly even approaching the early dynamical estimates of mass - loss rates as high as @xmath157 based on changes in the orbital period ( see  1 above ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , those dynamical estimates failed to take into account the possibility of a third body in the system , or of modulations of the orbital period by the magnetic activity itself .    here",
    "we would like to point out another argument , based on accretion , which suggests that a mass loss rate of order @xmath157 is probably too large for v471  tau .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows .",
    "the rate at which material is being accreted onto the surface of the wd has been found to be less than @xmath158 @xcite . as argued by mullan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and by sion et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this accretion rate is several orders of magnitude smaller than what should be occurring if purely hydrodynamical processes were in control of the flow of the k2 stellar wind around the wd .",
    "this suggests that a mechanism of some kind ( most probably a  magnetic propeller \" ) is providing a highly efficient shield to protect the surface of the wd from the passing wind .",
    "the properties of such a propeller allow us to set a limit on the mass - loss rate .    to determine this limit , we refer to the discussion of mullan et al .",
    "if the mass - loss rate from the k2 dwarf were to be as large as @xmath159 , the ram pressure of this wind would be so large that the  magnetospheric radius , \" @xmath160 , would be pushed in almost to the surface of the wd . specifically , inserting a mass - loss rate of @xmath159 into eqs .",
    "( 13)(18 ) of mullan et al . , we find that @xmath160 would have a numerical value of only @xmath161  cm , where @xmath162 is the polar magnetic field strength in mg .",
    "since the field strength is now known to be of order 0.35  mg from zeeman splitting of the photospheric lines @xcite , @xmath160 does not exceed @xmath163  cm .",
    "( the numerical value is quite insensitive to @xmath162 because of the small exponent : even if @xmath162 were to uncertain by a factor of 10 , @xmath160 would be uncertain only by a factor of @xmath32 . )",
    "the above estimate of @xmath160 is to be compared with the co - rotation radius , @xmath164  cm ( see eq .",
    "( 20a ) in mullan et al .",
    "( the value of @xmath165 depends only on the wd mass and its rotation period , both of which are reliably known . )",
    "we see that , with the above choice of mass - loss rate , @xmath160 is _ smaller _ than @xmath165 .",
    "the key point can now be appreciated : in a situation where @xmath166 , the propeller mechanism can not operate .    since , in fact , the propeller appears to be operating with high efficiency ( sion et al .",
    "1998 ) , we conclude that a mass - loss rate as large as @xmath167 from the k dwarf can be ruled out . in order to preserve propeller operation in the presence of a field of 0.35  mg , we find that the mass - loss rate from the k dwarf must not exceed about @xmath168 .",
    "this provides us with a lower limit on @xmath169 of @xmath3(0.5@xmath170 . using arnaud & rothenflug s ( 1985 ) tables , we find that the above lower limits on @xmath118 constrain the electron temperature in the place of cme origin to be no more than @xmath3230,000 - 280,000  k.    finally",
    ", we note that the estimates of mass - loss rate which we present here refer only to the component of mass loss associated with the transient events .",
    "it is possible that the k2 dwarf also loses mass from its corona in the form of a steady thermally driven wind .",
    "but the present data have insufficient sensitivity to allow us to study the properties of that component directly . the upper limit on @xmath171 that we derived above from propeller arguments refers to the total mass loss rate , i.e. , a combination of steady wind plus cme s .",
    "the v471  tau system ( dk2+da1.5 ) provides an extremely favorable opportunity to detect discrete episodes of mass loss from a magnetically active star , because of the presence of a strongly uv - emitting , nearly point - like close companion that shines through the stellar wind .",
    "magnetic activity in the k2 dwarf is kept at an unusually high level because the angular rotation is tidally locked to the orbital value , some 50 times solar . by extension from the case of the solar corona",
    ", we expect that the morphology of the corona in the k2 dwarf in v471  tau is dominated by magnetic structures .    in this paper , we report the serendipitous discovery of two transient absorption features of a resonance line , seen in _",
    "hst_/ghrs spectra .",
    "we interpret the transient absorption features in terms of material ejected from the chromosphere or corona of the k2 star and traversing our line of sight to the white dwarf .",
    "our analysis indicates that the absorption features have properties that are comparable to those of cme s in the sun , including size , velocity , complex structure , and ( lower limits on ) mass . the one property that shows striking differences from solar cme s is the rate of occurrence",
    ": we argue that the k2 dwarf in v471 tau ejects cme s some 100500 times more frequently than does the sun .",
    "we show that the k dwarf s mass - loss rate associated with cme s is at least ( 5@xmath5 , but it may well be considerably higher if most of the silicon in the absorbing material is in ionization states other than .    in fact , the principal uncertainty in our analysis is the lack of reliable knowledge of the fraction of silicon , @xmath118 , that is in the form of in the cme material ; this quantity depends on the unknown electron temperature at the point of origin of the material .",
    "however , since an efficient magnetic propeller appears to be at work in v471  tau , we can set an upper limit on the mass loss rate from the k2 dwarf of @xmath3@xmath172 .",
    "we have recently obtained additional uv spectroscopy of v471  tau with the space telescope imaging spectrograph , covering a much wider wavelength range than the ghrs observations reported here , and these data should provide much additional information on the excitation conditions in the wind and its mass - loss rate .",
