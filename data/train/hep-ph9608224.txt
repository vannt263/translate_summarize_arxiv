    "the masses of the superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles should not greatly exceed the tev scale if supersymmetry is to solve the hierarchy problem associated with the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "however , this fact by itself tells us surprisingly little about the scale @xmath3 at which supersymmetry is ultimately broken .",
    "it is also necessary to have an understanding of the mechanism by which supersymmetry breaking is communicated from its original source to the fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "if gravitational or other planck - suppressed interactions communicate supersymmetry breaking , then @xmath3 is perhaps @xmath4 gev or so . while this scenario has received the most attention in the last decade , it is hardly inevitable .",
    "another possibility @xcite is that the ordinary gauge interactions are responsible for communicating supersymmetry breaking to the mssm through their couplings to a messenger sector of chiral superfields , which in turn couple directly or indirectly to the fields which break supersymmetry .    in the  minimal \" model of gauge",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) @xcite , all of the soft supersymmetry - breaking interactions of the mssm are determined by just a few free parameters .",
    "perhaps the most attractive feature of this type of model is that the masses generated for squarks and sleptons with the same @xmath5 quantum numbers are automatically degenerate , so that flavor - changing neutral currents are suppressed without additional assumptions .",
    "this feature depends only on the fact that ordinary gauge interactions are flavor - blind , and will be true in a much larger class of models than just the minimal gmsb model .",
    "this class of models has another feature which may allow it to be dramatically confirmed at existing or currently planned collider facilities .",
    "because local supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at a relatively low scale , the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino ( the spin @xmath6 superpartner of the graviton ) , with a mass that is entirely irrelevant for collider kinematics ( but not for cosmology@xcite ) .",
    "the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) can therefore decay into its sm partner and the gravitino . in the case",
    "that the lightest neutralino ( @xmath7 ) is the nlsp , one has the interesting decay@xcite @xmath8 as long as the photino content of @xmath7 is non - zero .",
    "the decay length for this process depends on the ultimate scale of supersymmetry breaking @xmath3 , according to ( ) = _ 1 16 m_^5 _",
    "susy^4 where @xmath9 ( in the notation of @xcite ) is the photino content of @xmath7 .",
    "since in gmsb the typical @xmath0-term responsible for supersymmetry breaking can correspond to @xmath3 of order @xmath10 or @xmath11 tev , it is quite possible that this decay can occur ( at least a significant fraction of the time ) inside a typical detector , with many interesting phenomenological consequences@xcite .",
    "if it is sufficiently heavy @xmath7 can also have decays into @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with decay widths which suffer , however , from very strong kinematic suppression@xcite .",
    "recently it was pointed out@xcite that a single @xmath14 event @xcite observed at cdf could be naturally explained dominates@xcite .",
    "the parameter space in which this can occur will be largely but not entirely explored at lep161 and lep190 .",
    "] by gmsb ( and other theories with a light gravitino ) .",
    "this event had an energetic electron and positron , two energetic photons each with pseudorapidity @xmath15 and transverse energy @xmath16 gev , and large missing transverse energy @xmath17 gev .",
    "the sm and detector backgrounds for such events are reputed to be extremely small .",
    "this event can be explained by gmsb as either selectron pair production or chargino pair production , but only if @xmath7 is the nlsp , and if @xmath3 is less than about @xmath11 tev .",
    "these are not automatic consequences of all models , and therefore will give ( if taken seriously , which clearly should not be considered mandatory ! ) non - trivial theoretical constraints .    moreover , the discovery signatures of supersymmetry with a prompt decay @xmath8 are so spectacular that it is possible to set quite strong bounds even with existing tevatron data .",
    "in contrast to the usual supersymmetry search strategies , one can obtain a very high detection efficiency at the tevatron for the inclusive signal @xmath18 with suitable cuts on the transverse energy and isolation of the photons , and on the total missing transverse energy . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that with the present 100 pb@xmath19 of data at the tevatron , it should be possible to exclude a lightest chargino ( @xmath20 ) mass up to 125 gev and neutralino masses up to about 70 gev , assuming gaugino mass  unification \" relations as in the minimal gmsb model . in this paper",
    "we will discuss other models which do not share this feature .",
    "even when all assumptions about gaugino mass relations are abandoned , however , it was argued in @xcite that one can still find a model independent bound @xmath21 gev as long as @xmath22 gev ( to supply energetic photons ) by exploiting the inclusive @xmath18 signal .",
    "these bounds are quite competitive with and somewhat complementary to what can be done at lep upgrades .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that these bounds all assume that the decay @xmath8 occurs within the detector 100% of the time .",
    "this is not necessary , even to explain the cdf @xmath14 event , which only requires that some non - negligible fraction of @xmath7 decays occur within the detector .",
    "if most decays occur outside the detector , then one would expect many more single photon events than diphoton events , with unfortunately a much larger sm background , and much more difficult challenges for simulation studies .",
    "thus for example the discovery mode at lep2 from @xmath23 could be predominantly @xmath24 rather than @xmath25 .",
    "we should also note that in a significant fraction of the models to be studied in this paper , @xmath7 can not be the nlsp anyway unless it is higgsino - like .    while the minimal model of gmsb is quite elegant and",
    "can explain the cdf @xmath14 event , it is important to consider what all the related alternatives might be , especially in setting discovery and exclusion strategies .",
    "future phenomenological studies should therefore take into account the full richness of model - building possibilities , which undoubtedly extend far beyond the minimal gmsb model and in several different directions@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will begin to explore a few such possibilities . in section 2",
    "we develop the formalism for arbitrary messenger sector field content including the effects of arbitrary masses ( from scalar vevs and @xmath0-term breaking ) in the messenger sector . in section 3",
    "we will examine the discrete model space allowed by generalizing the particle content of the messenger sector to include possibilities which do not form complete gut multiplets .",
    "we will argue that it is not particularly unnatural or even inelegant to consider such generalizations .",
    "these effects serve to considerably enlarge the available parameter space , but in section 4 we show that some strong model - independent statements can still be made , and the gmsb models retain a distinct character even without taking into account the possibility of discovery modes involving decays into the gravitino .",

    "[ neatomodel ] which by itself ( or with additional gauge singlets ) does not happen to form any combination of irreducible representations of any simple gut group .",

    "those that do not can still participate in ensuring perturbative gauge coupling unification , but may not act as messenger fields and in particular can have little or no effect on the masses of mssm sparticles .",

    "therefore we will consider here the effects of a somewhat less constrained messenger sector .",
    "we will maintain the constraint that messenger fields should occupy the same representations as mssm chiral superfields .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that stable messenger particles with exotic @xmath102 quantum numbers are probably a disaster for cosmology .",
    "in fact it should be noted that in any case the lightest and the lightest color non - singlet members of the messenger sector must be stable insofar as they do not couple to mssm fields through non - gauge interactions .",
    "( there is an interesting possibility that a stable neutral messenger might make up the cold dark matter , however@xcite . )",
