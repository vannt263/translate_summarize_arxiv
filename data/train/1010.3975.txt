    "<S> however , to properly characterise the noise in these signals , it is critical to measure the _ unconditional noise floor _ : the signal detected when memory retrieval is triggered without any stored input signal ( figs  [ fig : single_photon](b , c ) , red curves ) . in our case , this is the detected signal when the control field is sent in with no input signal , and is measured to be 0.25 photons per pulse . </S>",

    "<S> these observations are well - described by a simple noise model ( supplementary information ) based on _ spontaneous raman scattering _ ( srs ) @xcite , in which stokes and anti - stokes photons scattered during the control pulse are both transmitted through our etalon - based filters ( see methods section ) and detected as noise . since the model does not include collision - induced fluorescence @xcite or leakage of the control , this suggests that these contributions are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : single_photon](d ) and ( e ) , around 60% of the noise affecting the quantum memory is emitted at the anti - stokes frequency ( when operated with maximal blue pumping ) and could be removed using further spectral filtering . </S>",
    "<S> this would already bring the true unconditional noise floor down to 0.1 photons per pulse resulting in an unconditional signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 10:1 for single photon retrieval . the remaining signal - frequency ( stokes ) </S>",
    "<S> noise remains even if the optical pumping and spectral filtering are perfect and has its origin in four - wave mixing seeded by spontaneous anti - stokes scattering . </S>",

    "<S> finally , although our fibre - coupled detection system is optimised for the mode of the signal , the noise is scattered mostly into the control mode @xcite , which suggests that the noise floor can be further reduced by angle tuning the control field @xcite . </S>",
