    "it was noted many years ago that the form of the @xmath12-meson peak is distorted by the interference between resonant and non - resonant @xmath0 production . for the case of `` elastic '' @xmath1 photoproduction",
    "the effect was studied by p.sding in @xcite and s.drell @xcite ( who considered the possibility to produce the pion beam via the @xmath13 process ) . at high energies",
    "the main ( and the only ) source of background is the drell - hiida - deck process @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the incoming photon fluctuates into the pion pair and then @xmath14-elastic scattering takes place .",
    "thus the amplitude for the background may be written in terms of the pion - proton cross section .",
    "recently the difractive elastic production of @xmath1-mesons was measured at hera @xcite both for the cases of photoproduction i.e. @xmath15 and of @xmath16 gev@xmath6 ( the so called deep inelastic scattering , dis , regime ) .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the interference with some non - resonant background is indeed needed to describe the distribution over the mass - @xmath17 of @xmath0 pair .",
    "it was proposed by m.arneodo that this effect can be used to estimate the value of @xmath18 from hera data at high energies @xcite ( @xmath19 gev ) , in the range which is not otherwise acceptable .    in sect .",
    "2 the formulae for the @xmath10 background which are valid for the dis as well as for the photoproduction region are presented .",
    "the expression differs slightly from the sding s one as we take into account the pion form factor and the fact that one pion propagator is off - mass shell .",
    "we consider also the absorbtion correction comming from the diagram where both pions ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) directly interact with the target proton .",
    "the role of the interference in photoproduction is discussed in sect .",
    "3 , where we estimate the @xmath3-proton cross section @xmath22 mb at @xmath23 gev . finally in sect .",
    "4 we compute the amplitude for a pion pair production in dis . at large @xmath24 gev@xmath6",
    "the background amplitude becomes relatively small , but still not negligible .",
    "it changes the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse @xmath12-meson production cross section and leads to the more slow increase of @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath1 photo- and electroproduction may be written as : @xmath27 are the resonant and non - resonant parts of the production amplitude , @xmath28 for longitudinal and transverse photons , @xmath29 -*q*@xmath30 is the momentum transfered to the proton and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the azimutal and polar angles between the @xmath20 and the proton direction in the @xmath10 rest frame .",
    "the dynamics of vector meson photo- and electroproduction was discussed in the framework of qcd in many papers ( see , e.g. [ 10 - 13 ] ) . however here",
    "we will use the simple phenomenological parametrization of the production amplitude because our main aim is the discussion of the interference between resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "so the amplitude for resonant process @xmath34 ; @xmath35 reads : @xmath36 to take into account the phase space available for the @xmath37 decay we use the width @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 mev and @xmath40 mev  its mass ) ; @xmath41 is the @xmath42-slope of the `` elastic '' @xmath12 production cross section @xmath43 ( at @xmath44 ) and the functions @xmath45 describe the angular distribution of the pions produced through the @xmath12-meson decay : @xmath46 @xmath47 note that for transverse photons with polarization vector @xmath48 one has to replace the last factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) by the scalar product @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unit vector in the pion transverse momentum direction .",
    "the amplitude for the non - resonant process @xmath52 is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the @xmath42-slope of the elastic @xmath14 cross section , @xmath55 is the pion electromagnetic form factor ( @xmath56 is the virtuality of the incoming photon ) , @xmath57 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath58  the photon momentum fraction carried by the @xmath21 -meson ; @xmath18 is the total pion - proton cross section .",
    "the factor @xmath59 is equal to @xmath60 for longitudinal photons the products @xmath61 are : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while for the transverse photons we may put ( after averaging ) @xmath64 .",
    "expressions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are the result of straitforward calculation of the feynman diagram fig .",
    "the first term in ( 6 ) comes from the graph fig . 1 ( in which the pomeron couples to the @xmath20 ) and the second one reflects the contribution originated by the @xmath65 interaction .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath21 electric charge leads to the minus sign of the second term .",
    "we omit here the phases of the amplitudes .",
    "in fact , the common phase is inessential for the cross section , and we assume that the relative phase between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is small ( equal to zero ) as in both cases the phase is generated by the same pomeron exchange .",
    "the form factor @xmath68 is written to account for the virtuality ( @xmath69 ) of the t - channel ( vertical in fig .",
    "1 ) pion . as in fig .",
    "1 we do not deal with pure elastic pion - proton scattering , the amplitude may be slightly suppressed by the fact that the incoming pion is off - mass shell . to estimate this suppression we include the form factor ( chosen in the pole form ) @xmath70 the same pole form was used for @xmath71 . in the last case",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is the mass of the @xmath12-meson  the first resonance on the @xmath12-meson ( i.e. photon ) regge trajectory , but the value of @xmath73 ( in @xmath68 ) is expected to be larger .",
    "it should be of the order of mass of the next resonance from the regge @xmath3-meson trajectory ; i.e. it should be the mass of @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "thus we put @xmath76 gev@xmath6 .",
    "finaly we have to define @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 in these notations @xmath81 and @xmath82 with the pion transverse ( with respect to the proton direction ) momentum @xmath83 ( in the @xmath10 rest frame ) given by expression @xmath84 .",
    "note that the positive values of @xmath85 correspond to @xmath86 while the negative ones @xmath87 correspond to @xmath88 .      to account for the screening correction we have to consider the diagram fig .",
    "2 , where both pions interact directly with the target . note that all the rescatterings of one pion ( say @xmath20 in fig",
    ". 1 ) are already included into the @xmath14 elastic amplitude .",
    "the result may be written in form of eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the new factor @xmath89 instead of the old one @xmath90 : @xmath91 where the second term is the absorptive correction ( fig .",
    "2 ) and @xmath92 is the momentum transfered along the pomeron loop .",
    "the factor @xmath93 reflects the contribution of the enhacement graphs with the diffractive exitation of the target proton in intermediate state . in accordance with the hera data @xcite , where the cross section of `` inelastic '' ( i.e. with the proton diffracted ) @xmath12 photoproduction was estimated as @xmath94 we choose @xmath95 .",
    "the results at @xmath96 ( photoproduction ) are shown in fig.3 .",
    "both slope parameters , @xmath97 in eq.(2 ) and @xmath54 in eq.(5 ) were assumed to be equal to 10 gev@xmath98 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the resonant production contribution .",
    "it is normalized to the experimental zeus data @xcite near the @xmath12 peak peak is about 1.5 times smaller than zeus coll .",
    "cross section @xcite , so we can not describe both experiments simultaneously . ] .",
    "the contributions of non - resonant production and its interference with resonant one depend on the form factor @xmath68 , the screening corrections and the value of @xmath18 . to demonstrate their role we present in fig.3 six variants of non - resonant ( dashed curves ) and interference ( dotted curves ) contributions .",
    "the upper dashed curve at the right - hand - side of fig.3 corresponds to the simplest calculation for @xmath99 and without screening correction .",
    "second ( to the down ) dashed curve shows the same calculation but with screening correction . here the value of @xmath100 mb was used .",
    "third and fourth curves show the results of calculations with form factor @xmath68 , eq.(7 ) , and @xmath101 mb , without and with screening corrections , respectively .",
    "fifth ( which is practically coinside with the fourth one ) and sixth curves correspond to the calculations with form factor @xmath68 , eq.(7 ) , @xmath100 mb , without and with screening corrections .    for interference contribution",
    "the upper curve at left - hand - side of fig.3 presents the case @xmath99 , @xmath100 mb and without screening correction .",
    "next two curves correspond to the calculations with form factor , eq.(7 ) , without screening correction and for @xmath101 mb and @xmath100 mb , respectively .",
    "the fourth curve shows the variant with @xmath99 , @xmath102 mb and with screening correction .",
    "fifth and sixth curves correspond to the calculations with form factor @xmath68 , eq.(7 ) , with screening corrrection and for @xmath101 mb and @xmath100 mb , respectively .",
    "the sum of all three contributions for the same six variants for background and interference terms are presented in fig.4 .",
    "solid and dashed curves here show the calculations without and with screening correction , respectively .",
    "the difference between the curves is as a rule smaller than the experimental errors .",
    "one can see quite reasonable agreement with zeus experimental data @xcite and some difference between the considered variants that can allow one to choice the best variant if the accuracy of the data will increase .",
    "it is necessary to note that the background and interference contribution have the same sign at @xmath103 and different signs at @xmath104 where these contributions cancel each other in part .",
    "so the last region is lesser sensitive to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "the to - day hera data @xcite are collected from the range of @xmath105 energy @xmath106 gev .",
    "mean energy of a pion , produced directly by the photon , is @xmath107 .",
    "thus the cross section @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath108 gev@xmath6 and one can see that cross section @xmath109 mb ( which is extrapolation by hand from lower energy region ) is in more or less reasonably agreement with the data .",
    "of course , more accurate analysis is needed for the extraction of @xmath18 with error bars .",
    "at very large @xmath7 the background amplitude ( 5 ) becomes negligible as , even without the additional form factor ( i.e. at @xmath99 ) , the non - resonance cross section falls down as @xmath110 , one factor @xmath111 comes from the electromagnetic form factor @xmath112 and another one  from the pion propagator ( term - @xmath113 in the denominator of @xmath59 ( see eq.(6 ) ) . ] while experimentally @xcite the @xmath7 behaviour of the elastic @xmath12 cross sections has been found to be @xmath114 , with @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , numerically at @xmath116 the background as well as interference contributions are still important .",
    "the results of our calculations of @xmath117 with @xmath18 = 28 mb , with form factor , eq.(7 ) , and with screening correction are presented in fig.5 .",
    "dashed curve show the case of @xmath8 pair photoproduction , four solid curves correspond to the electro production at @xmath7 = 1 , 4 , 10 and 30 gev@xmath6 , the dotted curve to the value @xmath7 = 30 gev@xmath6 and with @xmath99 .",
    "the dash - dotted curve corresponds to only resonant contribution at @xmath7 = 30 gev@xmath6 and with form factor .",
    "this value of @xmath118 should be independent on @xmath7 in the case of pure @xmath12-dominant model .",
    "really it has some slight @xmath7 dependence .",
    "the background as well as interference contributions lead to the nontrivial behaviour of the ratio @xmath25 with the two pion mass @xmath119 . in the theoretical formulae which we used the index @xmath120 denotes the polarization of the incoming photon . on the other hand experimentally one measures the @xmath12-meson polarization , fitting the angular distribution of decay pions . to reproduce the procedure",
    "we take the flows of initial longitudinal and transverse photons to be equal to each other ( @xmath121 , which is close to hera case ) and reanalyse the sum of cross sections ( @xmath122 ) in a usual way , selecting the constant and the @xmath123 parts .",
    "@xmath124 in these terms the density matrix element @xmath125 and @xmath126 namely these last ratios ( 12 ) are presented in fig.6 for different @xmath7 values .",
    "one can see that they depend both on @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
    "these ratios increase with @xmath17 for @xmath127 and this increase becomes more weak for large @xmath7 .",
    "we presented simple formulae for the background to elastic @xmath12-meson photo- and electroproduction which account for the absorptive correction and virtuality of the pion . the role of @xmath12-meson ",
    "background interference is not negligible even at @xmath128 gev@xmath6 , especially for the @xmath9 ratio .",
    "a reasonable description of the zeus photoproduction data is obtained with a value of the @xmath14 total cross section @xmath129 mb at energy @xmath130 .",
    "we consider this as an indication to the growth of @xmath14 cross section with energy in the energy region higher than the region of existing direct measurements .",
    "resonant ( breit - wigner , solid curve ) , non - resonant background ( dashed curves ) and their interference ( dotted curves ) contributions to @xmath131 reaction .",
