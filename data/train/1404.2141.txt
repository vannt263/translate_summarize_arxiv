    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    observations of high redshift type supernovae ia ( sneia ) @xcite-@xcite reveal the accelerated expansion of our universe , which nature is not exactly clear until now . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the density of matter is very much less than critical density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropies observations indicate that the universe can be considered flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical value ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . based on the experimental data , a component of the energy dubbed as dark energy is thought to be responsible of the physics of the accelerated expansion but it seems that it is not alone in the universe , so the mysterious matter component which is called dark matter should also exist . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy can be described by a pressure sufficiently negative in order to drive the acceleration of the universe and by positive energy density . </S>",
    "<S> there are several different models proposed to explain the nature of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant @xmath1 is the simplest model which can be considered , but in presence of many research papers in these fields , the origin of dark energy and dark matter is still unknown , and the possible connection between them is also unknown as well as real role of the components to the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this situation gives a lot of freedom to researchers and possibility of some simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant faced with two main problems , i.e. the absence of a fundamental mechanism which sets the cosmological constant zero or very small value ( which is known as fine - tuning problem ) and the problem known as cosmological coincidence problem , which asks why are we living in an epoch in which the densities of dark energy and matter are comparable . </S>",
    "<S> one of the interesting way to solve above mentioned problems is to consider interactions between components [ 6 ] . from observational point of view </S>",
    "<S> , no piece of evidence has been so far presented against such interactions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , possible interactions between the components of universe have been discussed in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a suitable interaction can help to alleviate the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> different interacting models of dark energy have been investigated [ 7 - 14 ] . </S>",
    "<S> + alternative models of dark energy suggest a dynamical form of dark energy , which at least in an effective level , can originate from a variable cosmological constant @xcite , or from various fields , such is a canonical scalar field @xcite-@xcite ( quintessence ) , a phantom field @xcite-@xcite , or quintom @xcite-@xcite . finally , an interesting attempt to probe the nature of dark energy according to some basic quantum gravitational principles are the holographic dark energy paradigm @xcite-@xcite and agegraphic dark energy models @xcite . among them </S>",
    "<S> a quintessence model is interesting in this paper as a component of dark energy . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the dark energy may be dynamical approaching zero with time , or it may be slowly increasing . it is now dominating the universe because the reduction of mass and radiation energy density with the scale factor ( which gives some information about the size of the universe ) is greater than the decrease in dark energy density in the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> in general , we would like the quintessence field to be decreasing with the scale factor and time at a smaller rate than the mass energy so that it will become dominant at redshifts less than one . </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence field has the property of being very weakly coupled to baryons but contributing a negative pressure to the equation of state . in the past it had a small contribution but with time it has decreased less quickly with the scale factor than the matter and radiation densities and is dominant now . + for the , dark energy component we consider several models in this paper , including viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , bulk viscosity is added to obtain more realistic models . however , a viscous pressure can itself play the role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + one of interesting dark energy models is the polytropic gas which was proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the polytropic gas model in the presence of interaction can behave as phantom field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that a polytropic scalar field can be reconstructed according to the evolutionary behaviors of the holographic and new agegraphic dark energy densities . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics was also examined for the polytropic gas model in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting model of dark energy may be van der waals gas which could be accounted as a fluid with unusually eos or could be thought a fluid satisfying to more general form of eos i.e. @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also some important models to describe dark energy based on chaplygin gas equation of state which recently considered by several papers such as @xcite , and yield to good agreement with observational data . </S>",
    "<S> + on the other hand , the lyra geometry provides one of the possible alternatives in modification of the cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> as we know the modification of the gravitational theory has long been famous , but the late - time cosmological acceleration caused to more research in this field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , we like to consider a universe filled with a two - component dark energy in lyra manifold with possibility of interaction between component . </S>",
    "<S> the first component assumed as quintessence , while we have several choices for the second component as viscous polytropic gas , viscous van der waals gas or viscous chaplygin gas . </S>",

    "<S> we obtain some observational constraints . finally , </S>",
    "<S> in section 7 , we write the conclusions of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    one of the well studied dark energy models is the quintessence model @xcite-@xcite , which is a scalar field model described by a field @xmath3 and a @xmath4 potential . </S>",
    "<S> it represents the simplest scalar - field scenario without having theoretical problems such as the appearance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density @xmath5 and the pressure @xmath6 of the quintessence scalar field model are given , respectively , by : @xmath7 and , @xmath8 canonical scalar field is not the unique solution </S>",
    "<S> . we can generalize it as follow @xcite , @xmath9 and , @xmath10 in the case of @xmath11 , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rhoqnew ] ) and ( [ eq : rhopnew ] ) transform to the canonical scalar field model with a rescaling of the field . </S>",
    "<S> below , we would like to consider an interaction term @xmath12 between dark energy and dark matter described by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive constants with a typical value of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> nature of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter is not clear . </S>",
    "<S> if we believe that it has a quantum origin , then an absence of the final theory of quantum gravity leave this question as an open problem . however if we believe that the link exist between components is due to the same origin of the dark energy and dark matter , then this approach does not give any exact solution , because the nature of the two component is not formulated and it is an other open problem . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only phenomenological assumption is an appropriate approach . for the dark matter model we will consider once a viscous modified chaplygin gas with the following equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants ( with @xmath21 in general relativity ) . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , we will consider two regimes : 1 ) when @xmath1 is a numerical constant ; 2 ) @xmath1 is a function of the cosmic time @xmath26 , therefore it is a varying quantity . in particular , we choose the following form for the time - varying @xmath1 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a positive constant , @xmath4 is the potential of the field which we consider as follow , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant parameter . </S>",
