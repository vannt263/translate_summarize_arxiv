    "in this work , we present the advanced solution for a perturbation of a schwarzschild background describing the head - on collision of black holes in the close approximation where the merger takes place in the far past .",
    "we compute the solution by means of a characteristic evolution of the weyl tensor , as governed by the teukolsky equation  @xcite .",
    "the advanced solution corresponds to stage i of a new two stage approach to the vacuum binary black hole problem  @xcite . in subsequent work ( stage ii )",
    ", we will use the results of this first stage to compute the physically more relevant retarded solution .",
    "this perturbative solution will in turn provide a valuable reference point for the physical understanding of a fully nonlinear treatment of binary black holes being pursued by a similar two stage strategy  @xcite , a computationally feasible problem using an existing characteristic code  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative results also provide a new perspective on the physical picture previously obtained by applying the cauchy problem to the close approximation  @xcite , especially with regard to global issues which have not yet been explored in the cauchy formulation .    in the characteristic formulation of this problem ,",
    "the advanced solution is simpler to compute than the retarded solution because of the global relationship between the null hypersurfaces on which boundary information is known .",
    "one of these hypersurfaces is the black hole event horizon @xmath0 whose perturbation must correspond to the close approximation of a binary black hole . in the retarded problem ,",
    "the other null hypersurface ( in a conformally compactified description ) is past null infinity @xmath1 where the incoming radiation must vanish .",
    "because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are disjoint , there is no direct way to use data on those two hypersurfaces to pose a characteristic initial value problem .",
    "however , in the advanced problem , it is at future null infinity that the radiation is required to vanish . since @xmath0 and @xmath2 formally intersect at future time infinity @xmath3",
    ", they can be used to pose a characteristic initial value problem to evolve backward in time and compute the exterior region of spacetime .",
    "potential difficulties in dealing with @xmath3 are avoided by posing the no outgoing radiation condition on an ingoing null hypersurface @xmath4 which approximates @xmath2 and intersects @xmath0 at a late time when the perturbation of the black hole has effectively died out .",
    "these data on @xmath0 and @xmath4 then constitute a standard double - null initial value problem  @xcite for the exterior spacetime , in which ingoing radiation is absorbed by the black hole but there is no outgoing radiation .",
    "this advanced solution provides the radiation incident from @xmath1 . in stage",
    "ii of the approach , this ingoing radiation will be used to generate a `` source free '' _ advanced minus retarded _ solution .",
    "a purely retarded solution can then be produced by superposition with the stage i solution .",
    "although we do not address stage ii in this paper , we will discuss the role of time reflection symmetry in the perturbation equations , which simplifies the technical details in carrying out the superposition . from a time reversed point of view , the stage i solution is equivalent to the retarded solution for a `` head - on '' white hole fission , with the physically relevant boundary conditions that radiation is emitted but that there is no incoming radiation from @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient here to formulate the stage i results in terms of such a white hole fission since the characteristic evolution then takes the standard form of being carried out forward in retarded time .    the close approximation has been extremely useful for testing fully nonlinear cauchy evolution codes .",
    "the results of numerical cauchy evolution and close - limit perturbative theory are in excellent agreement in the appropriate regime , giving great confidence in both approaches  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the perturbative approach provides an important tool for the interpretation and physical understanding of those results  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this vital synergism between numerical and perturbative approaches should also extend to characteristic evolution .",
    "however , in all perturbative studies performed to date , the background geometry has either been the schwarzschild spacetime in standard schwarzschild coordinates or the kerr spacetime in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "these coordinate systems are appropriate for comparison with results from nonlinear cauchy evolution but , to our knowledge , there does not yet exist a treatment of the close approximation in terms of null coordinates appropriate for the comparison with nonlinear characteristic evolution .",
    "this work provides such a framework .",
    "the methods and results presented here are expected to have direct bearing on the study of binary black holes presently underway using a fully nonlinear characteristic code .",
    "characteristic evolution has been totally successful in evolving 3-dimensional single black hole spacetimes for effectively infinite times ( @xmath5 in terms of black hole mass ) @xcite .",
    "although it is not yet known to what extent the characteristic approach can handle the inspiral and merger of binary black holes , it is clear that the limitations are due to difficulties in treating caustics and not due to high nonlinearity .    the characteristic data which has been obtained for the nonlinear description of a binary black hole spacetime generate close approximation data for a perturbative solution .",
    "we present here a numerical code to evolve such data as a perturbation of a schwarzschild spacetime in null coordinates .",
    "fortunately for our purposes , the perturbative formalism due to teukolsky  @xcite is amenable to a reasonably straightforward change of background coordinates , as observed in ref .",

    "the teukolsky equation is based upon the decomposition of the einstein equations and bianchi identities in terms of a conveniently chosen complex null tetrad , as carried out by newman and penrose  @xcite in the early 1960 s .",
    "the newman - penrose formalism allowed teukolsky to construct a single master wave equation for the perturbations of the kerr metric in terms of the weyl curvature components @xmath6 ( describing outgoing radiation ) or @xmath7 ( describing ingoing radiation ) .",
    "the teukolsky formalism provides a completely gauge invariant spherical harmonic multipole decomposition for both even and odd parity perturbations in terms of radial wave equations .",
    "for a kerr black hole with angular momentum , there is no similar multipole decomposition of metric perturbations in the time domain ( as opposed to the frequency domain of fourier modes ) . in the non - rotating case",
    ", the teukolsky equation reduces to the so - called bardeen - press equation  @xcite    since the 1970 s the teukolsky equation for the first order perturbations around a rotating black hole has been fourier transformed and integrated in the frequency domain for a variety of situations where initial data played no role  @xcite . in order to avoid the important but difficult problem of prescribing physically appropriate initial data for that equation ,",
    "the computation of gravitational radiation has been restricted to the cases of unbounded particle trajectories or circular motion .",

    "our overall strategy is to compactify the outgoing null direction and bring @xmath2 into a finite coordinate distance while maintaining regularity of the equations .",
    "we begin the description of our numerical setup with a discussion of the ingoing null geodesics , which forms the basis of our approach to the numerical solution of the teukolsky equation .",
