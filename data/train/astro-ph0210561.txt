    "over the years the existence of a primeval generation of ( very ) massive stars has been invoked in relation to various astrophysical issues ( see carr et al .",
    "1984 ; weiss et al .",
    "2000 for extended reviews ) , such as :    * fill the gap between the chemical abundances predicted by the big bang nucleosynthesis and those measured in population - ii stars ; * offer a viable solution to the g - dwarf problem in the solar neighbourhood ; * explain the observed enhancement in @xmath2-elements observed in metal - poor stars , as well as the chemical abundances in the inter - galactic medium as inferred from the spectra of high-@xmath3 damped ly-@xmath2 systems ; * contribute to the cosmological helium abundance ; * cause the re - ionization of the early universe ; * provide a source of dark matter , in form of stellar remnants , as required for galactic haloes and galaxy clusters .",
    "several models of population - iii stars were constructed in the 80 ( e.g. el eid et al .",
    "1983 , ober et al . 1983 ) . in recent years",
    ", the renewed interest from the cosmologic field has again spurred several studies on primordial stellar evolution ( e.g. marigo et al .",
    "2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "in this context we have carried out extensive evolutionary calculations , over a large range of stellar masses ( @xmath4 ) , covering the h- and he - burning phases , and allowing for a moderate overshooting from convective cores ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "rotation has not been included .",
    "stellar tracks are computed under the assumption of constant - mass evolution .",
    "additionally , for very massive models , with @xmath1 , we apply recent mass - loss rate ( @xmath6 ) prescriptions to account for i ) the radiation - driven winds at very low metallicities ( kudritzki 2002 ) , and ii ) the intensification effect on @xmath6 caused by stellar rotation ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) .",
    "0.3 cm    let us first consider the critical mass @xmath7 , that is the usually defined as the maximum initial mass for a star to develop an electron - degenerate c - o core , hence marking the boundary the limit between the class of low - intermediate - mass stars and that of massive stars .",
    "we find that it is around @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "figure 1 displays the expected trend of @xmath7 as a function of metallicity .",
    "it is essentially controlled by the mass of the he - core left at the end of the main sequence phase . at decreasing @xmath10 and for cno - dominated h - burning ,",
    "the initial slight decline is due to the development of larger convective cores , because of larger luminosities and more concentrated energy sources .",
    "then , the steeper rise at @xmath9 reflects a reversed situation , i.e smaller convective cores because of more extended burning regions .",
    "this is caused by the weaker temperature dependence energy generation rate when the p - p chain becomes competitive with the cno - cycle , and this latter operates at higher temperatures as in the case of @xmath9 ( or extremely low @xmath10 ) .",
    "a peculiarity of @xmath9 stars is that , differently from those with `` normal '' chemical composition , the onset of the triple@xmath11 reaction can already happen during the h - burning phase ( see marigo et al .",
    "2001 for a detailed discussion ) . in few words , due to the lack of metals ,",
    "initially the cno - cycle can not operate .",
    "the only available energy sources are the gravitational contraction and the p - p chain . due to the rather weak temperature - dependence of the latter , the central regions can contract until quite high temperatures are reached ( @xmath12 k ) , which lead to the onset of the @xmath13c reaction .",
    "as soon as a tiny abundance of @xmath14c is synthesised , then the cno - cycle can be activated for the first time .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 , such occurrence depends on the stellar mass , namely it takes place earlier and earlier at increasing @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , in the high - mass domain the triple@xmath11 reaction ignites as soon as the star settles on the zero - age main sequence , before burning any significant amount of hydrogen .",
    "figure 3 illustrates evolutionary tracks in the h - r diagram for selected values of the initial mass , under the assumption of constant - mass evolution . basing on these stellar tracks ,",
    "a set of isochrones has been constructed ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "it is available in electronic fromat at the web - address http://pleiadi.astro.it/.    with respect to massive models ( @xmath16 ) we can make the following remarks : i ) the h - burning phase is located at quite high effective temperatures such that , in combination with high luminosities , we expect these stars to emit large fluxes of uv photons ( see schaerer 2002 ) ; ii ) the he - burning phase takes place at decreasing effective temperatures at increasing stellar mass ; iii ) stars with @xmath17 remain always confined in the blue , and are not able to perform any redward excursion onto the hayashi line before the ignition of central carbon .",
    "this will have important consequences for the expected surface chemical changes ( see sect .",
    "2.8 cm    2.8 cm    -2.1 cm",
    "as we do not account for any rotationally - induced mixing , changes in the surface chemical composition are conditioned to the redward evolution of the star onto its hayashi line ( see fig .",
    "correspondingly , a deep convective envelope develops and extends into a chemically - variable profile ( left by the receding convective core during the h - burning phase ) , so that newly - synthesised elements are dredge - up to the surface .",
    "predictions for constant - mass evolution are shown in fig .  5    in summary , we find that the @xmath18 dredge - up is experienced by stars with @xmath19 , whereas the @xmath20 dredge - up takes place in stars with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noticed that further chemical changes may occur in the case of mass loss ( see sect .  7 . ) .",
    "mass loss is a crucial , but still uncertain , issue for primordial stellar evolution . in this work ,",
    "we consider two possible driving - processes , namely : radiative line acceleration and stellar rotation . to this aim",
    ", we adopt analytic formalisms recently presented by kudritzki ( 2002 ) , and maeder & meynet ( 2000 ) , respectively .",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "6 , referring to a @xmath25 model to which we apply kudritzki s ( 2002 ) prescription . in this particular case",
    ", the amount of mass ejected during the evolution from the zams to the onset of carbon - burning is negligible , i.e. @xmath26 . note the large extension ( in mass coordinate ) of the convective cores during nuclear burnings , and the continuous transition from the end of core h - burning to the onset of core he - burning . in practice",
    ", we do not expect any intermediate h - shell burning phase in zero - metallicity ( very ) massive models , due to the already high temperatures reached in the central regions at the stage of exhaustion od central hydrogen .",
    "close to the end of the main sequence , the @xmath25 model evolves towards lower effective temperatures until it approaches its hayashi line .",
    "consequently , an extended convective envelope develops so that the surface chemical composition is polluted with nuclear products of h - burning ( mainly @xmath27he and @xmath28n ) .",
    "stellar rotation is expected to increase the purely - radiative mass - loss rates .",
    "as already discussed by meynet & maeder ( 2001 ) , the almost total preservation of the initial angular momentum may favour the attainment of the break - up velocity ( @xmath29-limit ) . in combination with the very large luminosities of very massive stars , the @xmath30-limit",
    "might also be approached .",
    "however , it should be noticed that ( see heger & langer ( 1998 ) for an extensive discussion ) , since a large fraction of the total angular momentum is deposited in the outermost layers , the ejection of a relatively small amount of mass from the surface should make the star to get rid of a significant part of its angular momentum , with consequent spinning down of the rotational velocity . as a consequence ,",
    "the rotational effect on the mass - loss rate should also weaken .",
    "the effectiveness of stellar rotation in driving mass loss from zero - metallicity stars will be examined in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( marigo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this is an important issue for very massive stars , in relation to the possible occurrence of pair - instability supernovae ( heger a. & woosley 2002 ) ."
