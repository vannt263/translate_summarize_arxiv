    "the existence of multiple stellar populations in galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) is considered a widespread phenomenon ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with only a few possible exceptions ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even though chemically distinct , the age difference that should exist between populations , between tens to a few hundred myr depending on the origin of the enriched material , is extremely difficult to measure given the ancient ( @xmath0 12 gyr ) nature of all galactic gcs .    on the contrary , star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) exhibit a wide range of ages from a few myr up to clusters as old as the milky way gcs , with a distribution of masses overlapping the one in our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the study of younger clusters may give us a glimpse of the conditions of early stellar evolution in the now old gcs .",
    "specifically , in the case of young ( tens to hundreds of myrs ) and intermediate - age ( 12 gyr ) clusters , in principle both the chemistry and age difference between populations can be measured giving access to a more complete knowledge of their star formation history .",
    "the first clear evidence of multiple stellar populations in lmc clusters came from precise _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) photometry of intermediate - age gcs revealing extended main sequences @xcite , which was interpreted as extended star formation histories lasting a few hundreds of myrs .",
    "@xcite argued that up to 75% of their sample of 55 lmc clusters were not consistent with the single stellar population ( ssp ) hypothesis .",
    "the widespread nature of extended main sequences ruled out the possibility of them being the outcome of the mergers of two clusters with slightly different ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the straightforward interpretation of extended main sequences as signature of extended formation histories was quickly contended .",
    "an age spread visible at the msto level should also be visible at the red clump , but these do not show the expected spread in color and luminosity , being rather consistent with ssps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite for a different view ) , also , in young massive clusters in the lmc , where the effect on the color - magnitude diagrams should be even clearer , the evidence for multiple populations remains controversial @xcite .",
    "given the difficulties that the multiple stellar populations hypothesis face , stellar rotation has emerged as a more appealing explanation . fast rotating stars with ages",
    "@xmath0 1.5 gyr , when viewed from different angles would produce the same extension of the msto , mimicking the effect of multiple stellar populations @xcite , although it has been claimed that rotation alone can not fully reproduce the extended msto morphology @xcite .",
    "here we study the contribution of yet another ingredient into the nature of extended mss : the fact that the instability strip crosses the upper ms , msto and sub giant branch of intermediate - age clusters .",
    "variable stars near the msto could produce an spurious luminosity and color spread if their pulsation properties , in particular amplitudes , are not properly taken into account .",

    "this behavior is easily explained as the msto region moves in and out of the instability strip making the highest number of stars to develop pulsations close to 2 gyr .",
    "we stress , however , that absolute ages are model dependent , and different sets of isochrones will show differences of a couple hundred myrs to define the edges of the instability strip .",
    "in this paper we explored the influence the @xmath1  sctpulsators have in the morphology of the msto in intermediate - age clusters in the lmc . since the great majority of the photometry of these clusters comes from using merely 1 or 2 images per filter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there are several issues that variable stars _ can not _ explain , most notably the existence of bifurcated mstos in clusters like ngc 1846 @xcite and the presence of extended mstos in young clusters like ngc 1856 @xcite , where no influence of @xmath1  sctat the msto level is expected .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that @xmath1  sctwill affect the msto morphology for clusters in the 13 gyr age range , introducing a spread that can be misinterpreted as a departures from a simple stellar population , and therefore they can not be ignored .",
