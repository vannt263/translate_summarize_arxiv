    "the result of bisognano and wichmann is not only closely related to the unruh effect and the black hole evaporation , actually , in analogy of the rindler wedge with a black hole , it implies the hawking radiation , but has also made possible the derivation of some most fundamental concepts of quantum field theory , as there are the proofs of the pct theorem by borchers @xcite and of the spin - statistics theorem by guido and longo @xcite , where modular theory intervenes twice through jones index theory , the construction of the poincar group by brunetti , guido and longo @xcite , and the introduction of modular nuclearity condition by buchholz , dantoni and longo @xcite , nuclearity as a tool to single out models with decent phase space properties .",

    "but in general the modular action has to be non local and does not act as a geometric transformation anymore .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the massive scalar field is not invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "modular theory in general seems to become more and more a powerful tool for diverse problems and the natural formalism by which local quatum physics may be formulated .",
    "but the potential of modular theory will not be exhausted fully as long as the modular group @xmath88 acting on the massive algebras @xmath89 is not determined . with @xmath88 one would obtain a deeper and easier accessible understanding of the dynamics of quantum systems .",
    "more details on the state - of - the - art of the applications of modular theory in mathematics and physics as well as on the results given below can be obtained in @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of bisognano and wichmann , there have been many attempts to derive the massive modular group in the case of double cones , the most important spacetime regions , but no progress has been made so far .",
    "what should be mentioned are some assumptions on its nature , to be more precise , on the structure of its infinitesimal generator @xmath0 , where @xmath90 denotes the mass .",
    "it is well known that the generators @xmath91 of the massless groups are all ordinary differential operators of order one .",
    "because of the non local action and a result of figliolini and guido , who prove that @xmath0 is depending on @xmath90 in the strong generalised sense @xcite , one assumes that the generator @xmath0 has to be a pseudo - differential operator ( psdo ) , the generalisation of differential operators .",
    "the transition to psdos is easily seen , if we express an arbitrary differential operator with variable coordinates , @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with the following form , @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "the gradient @xmath112 does not vanish on the conic support of the symbol @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "this leads to the definition of so - called fourier integral operators , @xmath115 now , we are able to state our conjecture on the massive generator .",

    "this assumption is mentioned explicitly first by schroer and wiesbrock @xcite . however , the authors restrict themselves to a few remarks on their strategy how to calculate @xmath0 without giving proofs .",
    "this strategy supposes an intermediate step , namely the computation of the modular group @xmath118 on @xmath119 with respect to the ` wrong ' massless vacuum vector @xmath120 .",
    "they propose to derive , in a final step , the modular group @xmath88 and its generator @xmath0 with respect to the ` right ' massive vacuum vector @xmath121 via cocycle theorem .",
    "they assume that this procedure will not change the pseudo - differential nature of the infinitesimal generator .",

    ", @xmath88 has to act non - locally on @xmath89 , otherwise it would coincide with @xmath122 up to a scaling factor .",
    "thus , examples of modular automorphism groups acting non - locally may serve as a testing ground for the aforementioned assumptions on their infinitesimal generators @xmath0 . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there exist only two concrete examples for such modular groups in the literature .",
    "the first modular automorphism group is given by yngvason in the context of his investigation on essential duality @xcite , and the second one is introduced by borchers and yngvason who formulate modular groups in a more general setting , namely with respect to arbitrary kms states instead of the vacuum state @xcite .      in a poincar covariant wightman framework ,",
    "bisognano and wichmann identify the modular groups with the lorentz boosts and , furthermore , show that wedge duality holds .",
    "yngvason investigates the validity of these two properties for local nets @xcite .",
    "he can give explicit examples for fields violating essential duality , an implication of wedge duality and major assumption in the superselection theory , or lorentz covariance .",
    "we take one of his concrete examples as an opportunity to analyse the infinitesimal generator of a modular group with nonlocal action .",
    "he starts with a hermitian wightman field @xmath123 which transforms covariantly under spacetime translations , but not necessarily under lorentz transformations . for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us consider their special two - point function consisting of only one term , @xmath124 whose polynomial factorises as @xmath125 where @xmath126 ( in general no polynomial ) is analytic and has no zeros in the right wedge characterised by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the existence of such polynomials is ensured by the following example , @xmath129 where we have used the notation @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "one obtains the generalised free field @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the free field of mass @xmath90 , by setting @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for @xmath136",
    "one can now define the unitary operator @xmath137 on the fock space @xmath138 , first on the one - particle space @xmath139 by @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and then by canonical extension ( second quantisation ) to @xmath138 .",
    "one then introduces a one - parameter group of automorphisms on the von neumann algebra @xmath142 over @xmath61 generated by the weyl operators @xmath143}$ ] : @xmath144 yngvason identifies this group with the modular group with respect to the vacuum state on @xmath142 by proving the validity of the kms condition .",
    "since the operator @xmath137 maps the fourier transform @xmath145 of @xmath146 with @xmath147 into @xmath148 which is not analytic in @xmath149 and therefore can not be the fourier transform of a function with compact support in the @xmath150-direction , @xmath151 , @xmath152 can not be an element of any wedge algebra unless the wedge is a translate of @xmath153 or the left wedge @xmath154 .",
    "the operator @xmath152 is still localised only in the @xmath155-directions in the sense that it is an element of @xmath156 for some @xmath157 .",
    "one may ask if the non - local behaviour of this example is reflected in some way by the infinitesimal generator of the group .",
    "first , we derive the generator for the modular group , @xmath158 where @xmath159 , as @xmath160 for our example we obtain : @xmath161 while the second term in can be identified with the bisognano - wichmann infinitesimal generator , the first term containing the mass @xmath90 is a psdo of order zero .",
    "this additional part has to comprise the non local character of the modular group @xmath162 . to put it in a nutshell",
    ", we have verified the assumption [ assumption - gen0 ] with @xmath163      in @xcite borchers and yngvason give other examples for modular automorphism groups which act non locally on the wedges , light cones and double cones .",
    "whereas all investigations given so far have been concerned with modular groups with respect to the vacuum state , borchers and yngvason formulate the automorphism groups by means of kms states .",
