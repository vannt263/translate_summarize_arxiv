    "<S> a celebrated application of the theory of fractal diffusion is to the scaling of electrical conduction in random - resistor networks ( reviewed in refs.@xcite ) . according to ohm s law , the conductance </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 should scale with the linear size @xmath0 of a @xmath12-dimensional network as @xmath17 . in a fractal dimension </S>",

    "<S> the known @xcite values for @xmath19 are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , leading to a scaling @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this almost inverse - linear scaling of the conductance of a planar random - resistor network contrasts with the @xmath0-independent conductance @xmath23 predicted by ohm s law in two dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> all of this body of knowledge applies to classical resistors , with applications to disordered semiconductors and granular metals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum hall effect provides one quantum mechanical realization of a random - resistor network @xcite , in a rather special way because time - reversal symmetry is broken by the magnetic field . very recently </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , cheianov , falko , altshuler , and aleiner announced an altogether different quantum realization in zero magnetic field . following experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence for electron and hole puddles in undoped graphene @xcite , cheianov et al .  </S>",

    "<S> they analyzed both the high - temperature classical resistance , as well as the low - temperature quantum corrections , using the anomalous scaling laws in a fractal geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> these very recent experimental and theoretical developments open up new possibilities to study quantum mechanical aspects of fractal diffusion , both with respect to the pauli exclusion principle and with respect to quantum interference ( which are operative in distinct temperature regimes ) . to access the effect of the pauli principle one needs to go beyond the time - averaged current @xmath5 ( studied by cheianov et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and consider the time - dependent fluctuations @xmath24 of the current in response to a time - independent applied voltage @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations exist because of the granularity of the electron charge , hence their name `` shot noise '' ( for reviews , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> shot noise is quantified by the noise power @xmath26 and by the fano factor @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli principle enforces @xmath27 , meaning that the noise power is smaller than the poisson value @xmath28which is the expected value for independent particles ( poisson statistics ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of shot noise in a fractal conductor is particularly timely in view of two different experimental results @xcite that have been reported recently . </S>",
    "<S> both experiments measure the shot noise power in a graphene flake and find @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation @xcite of the effect of the pauli principle on the shot noise of undoped graphene predicted @xmath7 in the absence of disorder , with a rapid suppression upon either _ p_-type or _ n_-type doping . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is consistent with the experiment of danneau et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but the experiment of dicarlo et </S>",
    "<S> al.@xcite gives instead an approximately _ doping - independent _ @xmath8 near @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations @xcite suggest that disorder in the samples of dicarlo et al </S>",

    "<S> motivated by this specific example , we study here the fundamental problem of shot noise due to anomalous diffusion in a fractal conductor . while _ equilibrium _ thermal noise in a fractal has been studied previously @xcite , it remains unknown how anomalous diffusion might affect the _ nonequilibrium _ shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> existing studies @xcite of shot noise in a percolating network were in the regime where _ </S>",
    "<S> inelastic _ scattering dominates , leading to hopping conduction , while for diffusive conduction we need predominantly _ elastic _ scattering .    we demonstrate that anomalous diffusion affects @xmath1 and @xmath5 in such a way that the fano factor ( their ratio ) becomes scale independent as well as independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> anomalous diffusion , therefore , produces the same fano factor @xmath7 as is known @xcite for normal diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remarkable property of diffusive conduction , given that hopping conduction in a percolating network does not produce a scale - independent fano factor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our general findings are consistent with the doping independence of the fano factor in disordered graphene observed by dicarlo et al .  @xcite .    to arrive at these conclusions we work in the experimentally relevant regime where the temperature @xmath29 is sufficiently high that the phase coherence length is @xmath30 , and sufficiently low that the inelastic length is @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum interference effects can then be neglected , as well as inelastic scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli principle remains operative if the thermal energy @xmath32 remains well below the fermi energy , so that the electron gas remains degenerate .    </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly consider the case that the anomalous diffusion on long length scales is preceded by normal diffusion on short length scales . </S>",
    "<S> this would apply , for example , to a percolating cluster of electron and hole puddles with a mean free path @xmath33 which is short compared to the typical size @xmath34 of a puddle . </S>",
    "<S> we can then rely on the fact that @xmath7 for a conductor of any shape , provided that the normal diffusion equation holds locally @xcite , to conclude that the transition to anomalous diffusion on long length scales must preserve the one - third fano factor .    </S>",
    "<S> this simple argument can not be applied to the more typical class of fractal conductors in which the normal diffusion equation does not hold on short length scales . </S>",
