    "since the discovery of high temperature fe - based superconductivity,@xcite many types of fe - based superconductors have been reported including k@xmath0fe@xmath8se@xmath3.@xcite various novel phenomena were observed by chemical substitution on fe site .",
    "for example , co and ni doping in feas tetrahedra of lafeaso and bafe@xmath3as@xmath3-based pnictides give rise to superconductivity,@xcite whereas co doping in fese suppresses superconductivity.@xcite in particular , a@xmath0fe@xmath8se@xmath3 ( a = k , cs , rb , tl ) materials are strongly sensitive to chemical substitutions",
    ". @xcite    among several different types of fe - based superconductors , a@xmath0fe@xmath8se@xmath3 ( a = k , cs , rb , tl ) materials generate significant attention due to unique characteristics such as the absence of the pocket in the brillouin zone center and phase separation with fe - vacancy order where crystal separates into ( super ) conducting stripes ( block ) and magnetic semiconducting matrix regions on ( 0.01 - 100)@xmath9 m scale.@xcite the mechanism of the conducting and non - conducting states in proximity to k@xmath0fe@xmath8se@xmath3 is of the great importance for the understanding of superconductivity.@xcite consequently , the details of phase separation , phase stoichiometry , compositions as well as their magnetic and electric ground states are currently debated and are of high interest .    in this study",
    "we have investigated k@xmath0fe@xmath1co@xmath2se@xmath3 ( 0.06 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 1.73 ) single crystal alloys , where @xmath10 is fe / co vacancy .",

    "after that , the spin glass and metallicity decrease up to z@xmath240.9 . with further increase in co concentration , metallic conductivity spreads to higher temperature",
    "while spin glass is suppressed to lower temperature region ( below @xmath2420 k ) and ferromagnetic ground state emerges above the spin glass .",
    "k@xmath0co@xmath2se@xmath3 with z=1.73(4 ) is a metal , consistent with previous reports.@xcite we also note that ground state changes ( fig .",
    "6 ) are concurrent with lattice parameter variations . lattice parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath17 show general drop as @xmath5 is increased , in contrast to lattice parameters of @xmath18 .",
    "when the ferromagnetism emerges , lattice parameter @xmath53 in @xmath18 rapidly increases and is saturated similar to temperature dependence of curie temperature .",
    "it should be noted that both metallic conductivity and the total area of brighter stripe ( block ) regions increase with @xmath5 .",
    "this could imply that the brighter stripe ( block ) area is metallic whereas the matrix is semiconducting , both with and without co doping.@xcite the z=0.06(0 ) crystal shows semiconducting behavior through entire temperature region we measured ( 1.8 k@xmath4 t @xmath4 300 k ) , even though the metallic brighter stripe ( block ) areas are present ( fig .",
    "this is most likely because the connectivity of the three dimensional metallic stripe ( block ) area is insufficient to create metallic percolation in the crystal .",
    "the composite nature of our crystals and nano- to meso - scale mix of ( super)conducting and semiconducting magnetic regions may also create states at interfaces.@xcite this somewhat complicates the physical interpretation of bulk measurements . however , since in k@xmath0fe@xmath54se@xmath3 nanoscale phase separation exists below t@xmath55 = 560 k,@xcite most of conductivity changes below @xmath56 should come from the metallic regions .",
    "this is supported by recent angle - resolved photoemission results where orbital - selective mott transition in k@xmath0fe@xmath54se@xmath3 was observed above the crossover temperature.@xcite therefore , the absolute values of resistivity and magnetization reflect the contribution of both semiconducting k@xmath3fe@xmath6se@xmath7 and superconducting / metallic k@xmath0fe@xmath3se@xmath3 parts of the crystal . obtained thermoelectric power and heat capacity is contributed by metallic phase and semiconducting phase weighted by their conductivity .",
    "the estimated conductivity ratio between two phases are around @xmath24 10@xmath57 at 180 k which implies contribution of the metallic region is 1000 times larger than of semiconducting region .",
    "co substitution in superconducting / metallic k@xmath0fe@xmath3se@xmath3 unit cell is likely to have stronger effect on states associated with itinerant @xmath58 orbitals , for example via localization effect in an orbital - selective mott localization scenario.@xcite further co substitution and disorder might enhance conductivity by raising chemical potential and enlarging electron pockets , in agreement with our phase diagram.@xcite",
    "we have demonstrated how the structure , phase separation , transport , and magnetic property evolve with co doping concentration in k@xmath0fe@xmath1co@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals . a rich ground state phase diagram is discovered . by 3.5% of co doping superconductivity",
