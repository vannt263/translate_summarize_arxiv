    "the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model on a two - dimensional orthogonal - dimer lattice has attracted considerable attention since the pioneering work by shastry and sutherland , which has rigorously proved that the ground state is exactly dimerized provided the inter - dimer coupling is not stronger than a half of the intra - dimer coupling.@xcite later on , it has been verified by numerous analytical and numerical methods that the singlet - dimer state remains the true ground state even in a wider parameter range , which is limited just by the upper value @xmath3 of the interaction ratio between the inter - dimer and intra - dimer couplings.@xcite a lot of efforts have been subsequently devoted to the magnetization process of this frustrated quantum spin model , which additionally reveals several intriguing quantum ground states that macroscopically manifest themselves as intermediate magnetization plateaus.@xcite despite considerable efforts , there is still controversy and intense debate about the total number , size and microscopic nature of some intermediate magnetization plateaus .",
    "almost two decades after the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice was originally invented , the first experimental realization of this rather curious theoretical model has been found in the layered copper - based compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . the magnetic compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 has thus offered a long sought experimental verification of the singlet - dimer state theoretically predicted by shastry and sutherland,@xcite because the actual ratio between the inter - dimer and intra - dimer couplings @xmath4 is sufficiently small in order to fall into the parameter range where the product of singlet dimers is the exact ground state . early high - field magnetization measurements for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 have come up with convincing evidence of three sizable plateaus at 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/3 of the full magnetization in addition to the expected plateau at zero magnetization that corresponds to the singlet - dimer state.@xcite subsequent torque measurements performed by sebastian et al.@xcite suggested the presence of several additional plateaus besides the three most sizable plateaus mentioned previously .",
    "steady field experiments supported by nmr results@xcite have established the low - magnetization sequence of plateaus to be 1/8 , 2/15 , 1/6 and 1/4 . at very high field ,",
    "the first report in favor of a 1/2 plateau@xcite has been confirmed by recent magnetization data for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 recorded at ultrahigh magnetic fields which definitely established the presence of a robust magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the saturation magnetization , the width of which is nearly a half of that recorded for the most extensive 1/3 plateau.@xcite    another excellent realization of a magnetic structure relevant to the shastry - sutherland lattice is provided by a rather extensive class of isostructural rare - earth tetraborides rb@xmath5 ( r = dy , er , tm , tb , ho).@xcite however , the magnetic behavior of the rare - earth tetraborides rb@xmath5 is basically affected by the ising ( easy - axis ) anisotropy due to strong crystal - field effects acting on rare - earth ions in contrast to the almost isotropic magnetic behavior of the transition - metal copper ions in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "the metallic character along with the substantial ising anisotropy make a comprehensive description of magnetic properties of the rare - earth tetraborides much more complex , because one has to take into account the coupling between spin and electronic subsystems described in terms of ising ( or @xmath6 heisenberg ) and falicov - kimball models on the shastry - sutherland lattice , respectively.@xcite    in the present work , two independent rigorous analytical methods will be employed for investigating the ground state of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice in a magnetic field , which accounts for the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer and ising inter - dimer couplings .",
    "the main goal for our study is to identify the microscopic nature of spin arrangements emerging within intermediate magnetization plateaus through exact eigenstates of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice , which may also have interesting implications for the magnetization plateaus experimentally observed for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 and rb@xmath5 , as well as exact eigenstates of the full quantum heisenberg counterpart model .",

    "the general form of the effective low - energy model is then given by @xmath62 where the sums run over the sites @xmath44 of the effective square lattice built by dimers of the shastry - sutherland model and @xmath63 gives the orientation _",

    "the amplitudes of the effective model are determined in the thermodynamic limit by exploiting the linked - cluster theorem , i.e.  calculations on finite clusters are sufficient in order to treat all quantum fluctuations of a finite perturbative order correctly .",
    "the conventional quantum heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland is already special with regards to the linked - cluster expansion since the singlet ground state is an exact eigenstate and therefore no quantum fluctuations are present in the ground state .",

    "all amplitudes of the effective model can be determined on graphs consisting of at most three neighboring dimers in @xmath54- or @xmath73-direction , i.e.  the number and the size of graphs is tiny .",

    "exactly the same kind of contribution is obtained for the two - dimer graph in @xmath54-direction such that the triplet @xmath84 is located on a vertical dimer which is left .",

    "[ fig_gs ] ground - state phase diagrams of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice for a few selected values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath16 .",
    "a comparison between the displayed ground - state phase diagrams allows us to clarify the effect of quantum fluctuations pertinent to the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer interaction , the strength of which is controlled by the exchange anisotropy @xmath16 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_gs](a ) that we have correctly recovered in the ising limit @xmath180 the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 ising model on the shastry - sutherland lattice reported previously by dublenych [ ] , which involves the ising - dimer phase , the antiferromagnetic phase , the stripe 1/3-plateau phase and the saturated paramagnetic phase .",
    "it is noteworthy that all aforementioned phases become purely classical in the limiting case @xmath110 , i.e. there is no quantum reduction of local magnetizations within the stripe 1/3-plateau phase and no quantum entanglement between two - fold degenerate antiferromagnetic states within the ising - dimer phase due to the complete lack of quantum fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "the macroscopically degenerate ising - dimer phase is transformed into the unique singlet - dimer phase with a perfect quantum entanglement between two antiferromagnetic states once the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer coupling becomes non - zero ( i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized , moreover , that the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice remains qualitatively unchanged for any non - zero value of the exchange anisotropy @xmath111 [ c.f .",
    "[ fig_gs](b),(c),(d ) ] .",
    "the most fundamental difference between the spin-1/2 ising and ising - heisenberg models on the shastry - sutherland lattice thus consists in the presence of the checkerboard 1/2-plateau phase in the ground - state phase diagram of the latter model , which is however totally absent in the ground - state phase diagram of the former model .",
    "a more subtle difference can be still found within the stripe 1/3-plateau phase even though this phase is present in the ground - state phase diagram of the ising as well as ising - heisenberg model .",
    "in fact , the stripe 1/3-plateau phase undergoes according to eq .",
    "( [ qrm ] ) a quantum reduction of local magnetizations of the ising - heisenberg model with @xmath111 in contrast to fully saturated local magnetizations of the ising model with @xmath110 .",
    "the quantum reduction of local magnetizations within the stripe 1/3-plateau state is the stronger , the greater the transversal part of the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer interaction is ( i.e. the greater the parameter @xmath16 is ) . as far as two intermediate plateau states are concerned , one may generally observe the following general trends : ( i ) the easy - axis exchange anisotropy shrinks the width of the checkerboard 1/2-plateau until it completely disappears in the ising limit @xmath110 ; ( ii ) the easy - plane exchange anisotropy shrinks a width of the stripe 1/3-plateau although this plateau state does not entirely vanish in the @xmath35 limit @xmath181 .",
    "next , let us make a few comments on the ground - state boundaries between different phases , where an extremely high macroscopic degeneracy may come into play .",
    "for instance , one may formulate an effective hard - core square model at the boundary between the saturated paramagnetic phase and the checkerboard 1/2-plateau phase , because the energies of three - dimer clusters with the configurations @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 must inevitably become equal .",
    "if starting from the fully saturated state we may place the singlet state on a dimer without cost of any energy .",
    "however , two singlets can not be placed on nearest - neighbor dimers due to the restriction on the allowed configurations , which leads to an effective hard - core repulsion between particles representing singlets .    on the other hand",
    ", the ground state can be built up from any combination of the cluster configurations ( 0,0,0 ) , ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) , which are of equal energy at the boundary between the singlet - dimer phase and the stripe 1/3-plateau phase .",
    "therefore , the triplon state can be created in the singlet - dimer phase with the special conditions of hard - core repulsion : two triplons can not be placed on the nearest - neighbor dimers as well as on the next - nearest - neighbor dimers in a vertical ( horizontal ) direction for the horizontal ( vertical ) dimer , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the identical hard - core constraint for triplons was previously deduced for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice.@xcite the stripe 1/3-plateau phase can be thus viewed as the state with maximally dense packing of triplets , which still satisfies the afore - described hard - core constraint . of course",
    ", other states with a lower density of triplets are also allowed by the hard - core constraint , whereas these states have the same energy as the singlet - dimer and the stripe 1/3-plateau phase at their ground - state boundary determined by the critical field @xmath186 .",
    "this actually means that more complex ground states of the heisenberg model such as 1/8- , 1/6- or 1/4-plateau states coexist together with the singlet - dimer and the stripe 1/3-plateau ground states along their ground - state phase boundary.@xcite    the boundary between the antiferromagnetic phase and the stripe 1/3-plateau phase is somewhat different .",
    "namely , the three - dimer configuration ( -1,1,0 ) can be additionally realized at the respective boundary besides the configurations ( 1,-1,1 ) , ( -1,1,-1 ) and ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) , which are building block of the antiferromagnetic and stripe 1/3-plateau phases . with regard to this ,",
    "the boundary between these two ground states includes a lot of unexpected spin configurations .",
    "for instance , the ferromagnetic chain in the stripe 1/3-plateau phase can be extended to a set of ferromagnetically ordered chains , whereas the neighboring chains are magnetized in opposite directions with respect to each other and side chains are directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the situation at the boundary between the stripe 1/3-plateau phase and the checkerboard 1/2-plateau phase is quite similar .",
    "any random spin configuration involving antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic stripes is possible whenever the ferromagnetic stripes are separated from each other by one or two antiferromagnetic stripes .",
    "last but not least , let us compare our exact results for the ground state of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice with the known results for the analogous but fully quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice obtained within the framework of various numerical approaches.@xcite the zero - field ground states of the ising - heisenberg and heisenberg models are quite similar in two limiting cases corresponding either to the weak inter - dimer coupling @xmath187 or to the strong inter - dimer coupling @xmath188 . as a matter of fact , the singlet - dimer phase is the ground state of the ising - heisenberg as well as of heisenberg model in the limiting case of weak inter - dimer coupling @xmath187 , while the quantum reduction of local magnetization is the only relevant difference between the classical and quantum antiferromagnetic ground state of the ising - heisenberg and heisenberg models in the other limiting case of the strong inter - dimer coupling @xmath188 .",
    "hence , the most substantial difference between the zero - field ground states of both these models can be detected at moderate values of the inter - dimer interaction @xmath189 .",
    "it is worth recalling that the ising - heisenberg model with the isotropic heisenberg intra - dimer interaction shows a direct first - order phase transition between the singlet - dimer phase and the antiferromagnetic phase at the specific value of the inter - dimer interaction @xmath190 in contrast to the more complex behavior of the full quantum heisenberg model , which exhibits an additional plaquette zero - field ground state in a range of moderate values of the inter - dimer coupling @xmath191.@xcite    the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice in the @xmath192 plane is confronted in fig .",
    "[ fig_gs2 ] with the analogous ground - state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice adapted from the numerical data reported in refs .",
    "although there is still some controversy about the microscopic nature , size and total number of magnetization plateaus of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice in a non - zero magnetic field , the microscopic nature of the stripe 1/3-plateau and checkerboard 1/2-plateau has been firmly corroborated by numerous precise numerical methods along with a few more subtle 1/4- and 2/5-plateaus the nature of which is nowadays under intensive debate@xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the simplified ising - heisenberg model correctly reproduces the microscopic nature of the stripe 1/3-plateau and the checkerboard 1/2-plateau of the full quantum heisenberg model , whereas it gives through the exact eigenvector ( [ 1o3-phase ] ) some additional insight into the microscopic origin of the stripe 1/3-plateau state and the related quantum reduction of local magnetizations .",
    "in addition , it surprisingly turns out that the ground - state phase diagrams of the ising - heisenberg and heisenberg models are in a relatively good quantitative agreement not only in the limit of weakly interacting dimers @xmath193 but up to moderate values of the inter - dimer interaction @xmath194 .",
    "it is quite tempting to conjecture , moreover , that more subtle stripe 1/4- and 2/5-plateau states of the quantum heisenberg model are merely stabilized by means of the transverse ( @xmath35 ) component of the inter - dimer interaction , because these states coexist in the ising - heisenberg model at the singlet - dimer vs. stripe 1/3-plateau phase boundary and respectively , at the stripe 1/3-plateau vs. the checkerboard 1/2-plateau phase boundary .",
    "this result would imply that the ising - heisenberg model can be considered as a good starting point for the perturbative treatment of the full quantum heisenberg model .",
    "let us complete this section by the discussion of the application to some real compounds . in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , early thermodynamic measurements@xcite as well as the recent determination of the boundaries of the 1/3- and 1/2-plateaux@xcite point to a ratio @xmath195 .",
    "for this ratio , our ising - heisenberg model shows quite close results for the boundaries of the 1/3-plateau , while the boundaries of the 1/2-plateau are quite different from those of the heisenberg model ( see fig .  [ fig_gs2 ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is caused by the wide region of 1/3- and 2/5-supersolid phases below 1/2-plateau and the spin - liquid - like phase above it that were observed in the heisenberg model.@xcite therefore , the upper boundary of 1/2-plateau is rather related to the saturation field of the corresponding heisenberg model .",
    "we can briefly consider another compound with the magnetic structure the shastry - sutherland model , ( cucl)ca@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite it corresponds to the isotropic heisenberg model with strong antiferromagnetic intra - dimer and ferromagnetic inter - dimer couplings , and shows a transition from a spin - singlet ground state to the magnetized phase at the critical field @xmath196  t which correspond to a zeeman energy of 11.1  k.@xcite from eq .",
    "( [ h_fm ] ) we can estimate the relation between intra - dimer and inter - dimer interactions as @xmath197  k. the results for the heisenberg and ising - heisenberg model perfectly coincide in this particular case , since they both describe a direct field - induced transition from the phase of uncorrelated singlets to polarized dimers .",
    "the main reason for this surprising quantitative agreement is that the quantum ( @xmath198 ) part of the inter - dimer interaction has no effect on both aforementioned phases of the corresponding heisenberg model .",
    "the present work deals with the ground - state behavior of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice with the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer interaction and the ising inter - dimer interaction . exact ground states of the model have been obtained by two independent procedures leading to equivalent effective hamiltonians : the former one takes advantage of a local unitary transformation in order to establish a rigorous mapping correspondence with an effective classical spin-1 model , while the latter method leads to an effective hard - core boson model by a graph - based continuous unitary transformation .",
    "apart from the exact ground states and ground - state phase diagrams we have also studied in some detail the degeneracy at particular phase boundaries .    it has been demonstrated that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice exhibits a zero - temperature magnetization curve with just two intermediate plateaus at 1/3 and 1/2 of the saturation magnetization .",
    "the 1/3-plateau corresponds to a regular alternation of diagonal stripes of polarized dimers with two diagonal stripes of spin - singlet - like dimers , while a checkerboard ordering of singlets and polarized triplets takes place at the 1/2-plateau .",
    "the microscopic nature of the remarkable stripe 1/3-plateau has been thoroughly investigated with the help of the corresponding exact eigenvector , which shows that the quantum reduction of the local magnetization within this peculiar ground state is due to the competition between the ising inter - dimer coupling and the transverse part of the @xmath6 heisenberg intra - dimer coupling .",
    "the rigorous results for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice have been also compared with the analogous results for the purely classical ising and full quantum heisenberg models .",
    "it has been verified that the ground - state phase diagrams of the ising - heisenberg and heisenberg models are in a relatively good quantitative accordance up to moderate values of the inter - dimer coupling @xmath194 .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the 1/8- , 1/6- , and 1/4-plateaus coexist at the phase boundary between the singlet - dimer phase and the stripe 1/3-plateau phase and similarly , the stripe 2/5-plateau coexists at the phase boundary between the stripe 1/3-plateau and checkerboard 1/2-plateau .",
    "this result suggests that the exactly solved ising - heisenberg model could be used as a good starting point for a perturbative treatment of its full quantum heisenberg counterpart model in order to find out how the transverse component of the @xmath6 inter - dimer interaction can stabilize those plateau states .",

    "<S> exact ground states of a spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice with heisenberg intra - dimer and ising inter - dimer couplings are found by two independent rigorous procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the first method uses a unitary transformation to establish a mapping correspondence with an effective classical spin model , while the second method relies on the derivation of an effective hard - core boson model by continuous unitary transformations . </S>",
    "<S> both methods lead to equivalent effective hamiltonians providing a convincing proof that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice exhibits a zero - temperature magnetization curve with just two intermediate plateaus at one - third and one - half of the saturation magnetization , which correspond to stripe and checkerboard orderings of singlets and polarized triplets , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the remarkable stripe order relevant to the one - third plateau is thoroughly investigated with the help of the corresponding exact eigenvector . </S>",
    "<S> the rigorous results for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice are compared with the analogous results for the purely classical ising and fully quantum heisenberg models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss to what extent the critical fields of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 and ( cucl)ca@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 can be described within the suggested ising - heisenberg model . </S>"
