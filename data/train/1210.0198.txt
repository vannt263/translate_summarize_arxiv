    "the third condition in ( [ eq : formulation1 ] ) translates into the requirement that the span of the first two rows intersects the rowspace of @xmath83 $ ] . from this",
    "we derive the _ rank formulation _ @xmath84 this formulation of our problem is elegant and is adapted to projective geometry in @xmath16 . in terms of equations ,",
    "we simply take the minors of size @xmath85 of the matrix @xmath7 , and the minors of size @xmath86 of the matrix @xmath87 . however , this has two serious disadvantages : first , the number of minors is enormous , and second , we must get rid of extraneous solutions by saturation .",
    "namely , to get rid of solutions @xmath7 with @xmath88 , we need to saturate by the @xmath89-minors of @xmath7 , and to get rid of solutions on the boundary , we need to saturate by the product of linear forms @xmath90 .",
    "this was done symbolically in @xcite .",
    "the calculation can be sped up a little bit by taking only @xmath63 of the rows of @xmath70 , while also imposing the non - homogeneous equation @xmath91 .",
    "finally , we can replace the first two rows of @xmath70 by a single row @xmath74 - u_{++ } [ p]$ ] and require that the maximal minors of the resulting @xmath92-matrix be zero .",
    "this leads to some improvements but is still far from sufficient to get to the full range of ml degrees reported in theorem [ thm : mlvalues ] .    to get to those results , we pursue the following alternatives : first",

    "the em algorithm is an iterative method that converges to a critical point of that function , and , under some mild regularity hypotheses , that critical point @xmath362 is then a local maximum .",
    "the image @xmath360 of the point in @xmath345 is then a candidate for the global maximum of @xmath17 on @xmath345 .",
    "[ ex : em45b ] we tried the em algorithm also for @xmath410 on the @xmath324 data matrix @xmath13 in examples [ ex:4x5numeric ] and [ ex : em45 ] .",
    "we ran @xmath381 iterations with starting points sampled from the uniform distribution on the @xmath411-dimensional parameter polytope @xmath412 . from these @xmath381 runs of the em algorithm",
    ", @xmath413 converged to one of eight local  maxima .",
    "three of the runs led to other fixed points .",
    "the following six local maxima are precisely the solutions already found in example [ ex:4x5numeric ] .",
    "we note that , in this particular instance , it happened that all local maxima in the rank model @xmath397 actually lie in @xmath414 , i.e.  they have non - negative rank @xmath306 : @xmath415 in addition , our runs of the em algorithm discovered the two local maxima @xmath416 these do not satisfy the likelihood equations .",

    "it would be very interesting to carefully analyze the ( algebraic ) geometry of the em algorithm , even in the small cases of theorem [ thm : mlvalues ] .",
