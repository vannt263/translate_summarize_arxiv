    "this large variation in values for @xmath3 reported in the literature is partly due to insufficient methods of data capturing and data analysis .",
    "in previous experimental studies , different kinds of measurement methods are used and often a mixture of time and space averages are realized . especially in the case of spatial and temporal inhomogeneities the choice of the measurement method and the type of averaging have a substantial influence on the results @xcite .    up to now , congested states in pedestrian dynamics",
    "have not been analyzed in much detail .",
    "this is in contrast to vehicular traffic where the congested phase is well - investigated , both empirically and theoretically @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we show that even improved classical measurement methods using high precision trajectories but basing on mean values of density and velocity fail to resolve important characteristics of congested states . for a thorough analysis of pedestrian congestion",
    "we apply a new method enabling measurements on the scale of single pedestrians .",

    "however the resulting velocity - density relation does not allow to identify phase - separated states although these are clearly visible in the trajectories .      to identify phase separated states we determine the velocity - density relation on the scale of single pedestrians .",

    "the right peak represents the moving phase , whereas the left peak represents the stopping phase . at densities around 2.2  m@xmath29",
    "these peaks coexist , indicating phase separation into a flowing and a jammed phase .      in highway traffic ,",
    "phase separation into moving and stopping phases typically occurs when the outflow from a jam is reduced compared to maximal possible flow in the system .",
    "related phenomena are hysteresis and a non - unique fundamental diagram . at intermediate densities two different flow values can be realized .",
    "the larger flow , corresponding to a homogeneous state , is metastable and breaks down due to fluctuations or perturbations ( capacity drop ) .",
    "the origin of the reduced jam outflow is usually ascribed to the so - called slow - to - start behaviour ( see @xcite and references therein ) , i.e.  an delayed acceleration of stopped vehicles due to the loss of attention of the drivers etc .",
    "the structure of the phase - separated states in vehicular traffic is different from the ones observed here . for vehicle traffic",
    "the stopping phase corresponds to a jam of maximal density whereas in the moving phase the flow corresponds to the maximal _ stable _ flow , i.e.  all vehicles in the moving phase move at their desired speed .",
    "this scenario is density - independent as increasing the global density will only increase the length of the stopping region without reducing the average velocity in the free flow regime .",
    "the probability distribution of the velocities ( in a periodic system ) shows a similar behaviour to that observed in fig .",

    "the position of the free flow peak in the case of vehicular traffic is independent of the density .",
    "the behaviour observed here for pedestrian dynamics differs slightly from that described above .",
    "the main difference concerns the properties of the moving regime . here",
    "the observed average velocities are much smaller than the free walking speeds . therefore the two regimes observed in the phase separated state are better characterized as  stopping \" and  slow moving \" regimes .",
    "further empirical studies are necessary to clarify the origin of these differences .",
    "one possible reason are the different acceleration properties of vehicles and pedestrians as well as anticipation effects",
    ". it also remains to be seen whether in pedestrian systems phenomena like hysteresis can be observed .",
    "in this section we introduce the adaptive velocity model , which is based on an event driven approach @xcite .",
    "a pedestrian can be in different states which determine the velocity .",
    "a change between these states is called _ event_. the model was derived from force - based models , where the dynamics of pedestrians are given by the following system of coupled differential equations @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the force acting on pedestrian @xmath11 .",
