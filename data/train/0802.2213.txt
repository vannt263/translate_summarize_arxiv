    "t tauri stars are young solar - like stars that are still in the process of contracting onto the main sequence .",
    "the so - called classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) show signs of active accretion and are typically younger than their counterparts the weak - line t tauri stars .",
    "one of the enduring puzzles about ctts is their slow to moderate rotation , which suggests that they must have succeeded in losing angular momentum as they contracted .",
    "this can in principle be achieved by magnetically coupling the star to its disk and indeed the presence of a disk , as indicated by ir excesses does seem to be correlated with slower rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the detailed mechanisms by which this coupling is achieved are still unclear , the general hypothesis is well established .",
    "the stellar magnetic field disrupts the inner edge of the disk , forcing accreting material to flow along field lines down to the stellar surface .",
    "the torque associated with this magnetic field may balance the accretion torque , thus preventing the star from spinning up .",
    "any attempt by the star to spin up generates a stronger magnetic field which exerts a greater torque that acts to slow the star down .",
    "field strengths at the stellar surface can then be estimated by calculating the values at the disk necessary for such a torque balance and extrapolating back to the surface , assuming some simple geometry @xcite . this process , however , requires surface field strengths of around 0.1 - 5 kg and a disk that is truncated close to the keplerian corotation radius .",
    "the models can in principle be tested by measuring the surface field strength of t tauri stars .",
    "zeeman - broadening measurements can now be used to measure mean fields on the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "this gives distributions of local field strengths on the stellar surface that may be as high as 6 kg which is well within the range predicted by theory .",
    "however , these are similar on both accreting and non - accreting t tauri stars , suggesting that disk - locking is not responsible for determining the field strength",
    ". there also seems to be little correlation with either the values predicted by theory , or with the stellar rotation rotation rate or rossby number .",
    "furthermore , although the average surface field strengths reach several kg , current observations indicate that the strength of the dipole component is at least an order of magnitude below what is required for disc - locking models to operate ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a complementary approach is to use circular polarisation measurements both in photospheric lines ( presumably formed across the whole stellar surface ) and the helium @xmath25876 emission line believed to form in the accretion shock @xcite .",
    "polarisation measurements taken at a range of rotation phases can then be used to provide information on the structure of the magnetic field both across the surface and in the accretion shock .",
    "the low circular polarisation measured in photospheric lines rules out the presence of a global dipole , suggesting perhaps a complex field that may be locally very intense , but which is organised into small enough scales that the zeeman signatures are complex in shape and associated with small longitudinal fields . in comparison ,",
    "the large , rotationally modulated unipolar zeeman signatures in the helium emission lines suggest that the field associated with accretion is much simpler .",
    "this is no doubt to be expected , since it is the largest - scale field lines that will interact with the disk and these are likely to have the simplest structure .",
    "the nature of the star - disk interaction will clearly depend on the structure of the whole coronal field , and in particular the degree to which the complexity that seems apparent at the stellar surface may have died away by the time the coronal field reaches the inner edge of the disk .",
    "signatures of this complexity may be apparent in the x - ray emission from t tauri stars .",
    "in addition to the ubiquitous flaring - like variability seen in the x - ray emission of the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( coup ; getman et al .",
    "2005 ) stars , there is also a clear rotational modulation in a small but significant number of these stars @xcite .",
    "such modulation has previously been difficult to detect because it requires continuous observation over several rotation periods @xcite .",
    "this rotational modulation suggests that the x - ray coronae of t tauri stars are compact , with discrete bright and dark regions .",
    "some contribution to the rotational modulation may also come from the accretion funnels themselves , which , if they are dense enough , may obscure the underlying emission . @xcite",
    "have modelled the structure of t tauri coronae and found significant rotational modulation , with x - ray periods that are typically equal to the optical period ( or one half of it ) .",
    "while there seems to be little time - correlation between optical and x - ray variability , there appears to be a significant correlation between optical variability and x - ray luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission of t tauri stars is primarily produced in a complex arrangement of magnetically - active regions in a manner similar to observed on the sun @xcite .",
    "one singularly non - solar aspect of t tauri coronae however is the possible interaction between the magnetic field of the star and the accretion disk .",
    "both in the coup study and also more recently in the droxo ( deep rho ophiuchi xmm - newton observation ) study , there are flares for which modelling suggests the loops responsible must be large - perhaps reaching out into the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "field lines that connect the star and the disk in this way will be stressed by their interaction with the disk and may indeed carry much of the accretion torque @xcite .",
    "the nature of the star - disk interaction may therefore depend on the structure of the magnetic field that links to the disk , whether it is primarily open as in these more recent models , or closed as in the traditional disk - locking models @xcite .",
    "recent models of accretion powered stellar winds suggest that the angular momentum gained by the star due to accretion may be lost in a stellar wind , rather than exported back into the disk @xcite .",
    "the degree of complexity of the field affects the torque that it can exert and the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "recent results by @xcite suggest that the nature of this star - disk interaction may be fundamentally different in high and low mass stars .",
    "if we consider pre - main sequence stars of progressively lower mass , their pressure scale heights @xmath3 will _ increase _ ( since for a polytrope @xmath4 and so @xmath5 ) while their co - rotation radii will _",
    "decrease_. thus the lower the stellar mass , the more likely it is that the co - rotation radius will be within the corona . if a disk is present , this may mean that the disk strips off the outer edge of the corona , converting field lines that were closed and therefore possibly x - ray bright , to an open , x - ray dark , wind - bearing configuration . even in the absence of a disk , of course , centrifugal effects may do the same job , preventing the corona from extending much beyond the co - rotation radius @xcite .",
    "this may well explain the drop in x - ray emission measures towards lower masses seen in the coup dataset ( getman et al . 2005 ) but it also suggests that for the higher - mass stars , whose coronae may not extend as far as the co - rotation radius , any disk that exists at the co - rotation radius may interact not with the closed x - ray emitting field lines of the star but rather with the open field , which in the absence of a disc would carry a stellar wind .",
    "it is not clear what effect this would have on the interaction of the stellar and disk magnetic fields , and in particular on the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "this may be determined by a balance between the matter energy density of the disk and the magnetic energy density of the stellar magnetic field , or by a small - scale balance between the disk viscosity and the resistivity which allows matter to transfer from disk field lines to stellar field lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it seems clear that not only the strength of the stellar field but also its structure are important .",
    "recent models by @xcite suggest that accretion funnels may indeed form in mildly - accreting t tauri stars with weak dipolar fields of only 140 g , but that higher field strengths or different field topologies are needed to explain more typical accretion rates of @xmath6  .",
    "in this paper we use recently - published surface magnetograms of a fairly typical t tauri star to determine the structure of its corona and in particular to investigate the relationship between the closed - field regions that may contribute to the x - ray emission , the open field lines that may contribute to the wind and the field lines that pass through the equatorial plane inside of co - rotation which are available to accrete . by solving for the flow along these accreting field lines",
    "we determine the influence of the accretion funnels on the predicted magnitude and rotational modulation of the x - ray emission and also the mass accretion rate .",
    "v2129  oph ( sr  9 , as  207a , gy  319 , rox  29 , hbc  264 ) is a fairly typical , moderately accreting classical t tauri star with rotation rate of 6.53 d @xcite .",
    "many of its parameters are derived in @xcite and we simply summarise their results here .",
    "they find a radius and mass of @xmath7  and @xmath8   ( which imply that the co - rotation radius is at 6.8@xmath9 ) and using the evolutionary models of @xcite , they obtain an age of about 2  myr and conclude that v2129 oph is no longer fully convective , with a small radiative core of mass @xmath10  and radius @xmath11  .",
    "the presence of a radiative core is relevant to the nature of magnetic field generation since it provides a region of high shear at the boundary between the core and the convective region within which field can be generated .",
    "the mass accretion rate may be derived from the equivalent width of the 8662  line emission core , giving @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that  is significantly larger , about @xmath13  .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume here that @xmath6  , i.e. , a conservative compromise between both estimates and a typical value for a mildly accreting cttss .",
    "the surface magnetic field maps derived by @xcite are based on circular polarisation zeeman signatures detected in both photospheric lines and also in emission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion .",
    "the surface field that is recovered is complex , with many mixed - polarity regions .",
    "it is dominated by a 1.2 kg octupole , tilted by about 20@xmath14 to the rotation axis .",
    "a weaker dipole component is also present , with polar strength of 0.35 kg and a similar tilt of about 30@xmath14 . for the hemisphere in view",
    ", accretion appears to be concentrated in a single high - latitude region which covers about 5@xmath1 of the stellar surface and is in view at around rotation phase 0.8 .",
    "this apparently coincides with a dark polar feature at the photospheric level .",
    "observational evidence that the visible accretion spot is located at high latitudes is strong ; the low amplitude fluctuations in the radial velocity of the he i line ( or the ca ii irt emission core ) on the one hand , and the fact that the accretion spot ( and associated zeeman signature ) is always visible to the observer on the other hand , both argue in favour of this interpretation .",
    "this implies that any accretion from the disk must flow up out of the equatorial plane in order to impact the stellar surface at high latitudes .",
    "once the surface magnetic field is known it is possible to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field using a variety of methods and assumptions .",
    "two of the most commonly - used are a full mhd solution and the `` potential field source surface '' method which was originally developed by @xcite for extrapolating the sun s coronal field from solar magnetograms .",
    "the latter has the advantage of computational speed and simplicity , but it can not reproduce time - dependent or non - potential effects , both of which are likely to be important for the structure of the field in the region of the accretion disk . the former method can treat both of these effects , but is computationally very expensive and requires some assumption of an equation of state ( often a polytrope is used ) and the nature of the energetics . a review and comparison of the two techniques is given in @xcite .    while a full mhd solution is desirable in order to determine the nature of the interaction of the stellar field with the accretion disk , we postpone this approach for the moment , and concentrate on the first question that should be asked : is this surface magnetogram consistent with the inferred location of the accretion flows ? these flows originate in the accretion disk and if they are magnetically - channelled , the location at which they arrive at the stellar surface must depend on the structure of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "only some fraction of the field lines that leave the stellar surface ever come close enough to the accretion disk to interact with it .",
    "this interaction is likely to be time - dependent and to inject stresses into the magnetic field , just as the convective motions , surface differential rotation and meridional flows stress the magnetic field lines that emerge through the stellar surface .",
    "nonetheless , the subset of stellar field lines that pass through the disk and so are available to accrete is likely to be determined principally by the nature of the stellar field .",
    "we concentrate therefore on determining this overall structure and on determining which field lines are available for accretion and where they connect to the stellar surface .",
    "we therefore use the `` potential field source surface '' method with a code originally developed by @xcite .",
    "since the method has been described in @xcite we provide only an outline here .",
    "briefly , we write the magnetic field @xmath15 in terms of a flux function @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and the condition that the field is potential ( @xmath18 ) is satisfied automatically .",
    "the condition that the field is divergence - free then reduces to laplace s equation @xmath19 with solution in spherical co - ordinates @xmath20 @xmath21           p_{lm}(\\theta ) e^{i m \\phi } ,   \\label{psi}\\ ] ] where the associated legendre functions are denoted by @xmath22 .",

    "this second condition models the effect of the plasma pressure in the corona pulling open field lines to form a stellar wind .",
    "it imposes a relation between the term in ( [ psi ] ) that grows with radius and has coefficient @xmath26 and the term that decays with radius and has coefficient @xmath27 , since it implies that @xmath30 hence as the source surface radius decreases , the ratio @xmath31 increases and therefore the contribution to @xmath16 of the part that grows with @xmath32 becomes relatively larger . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ meanb ] ) , this means that at any given height , as the source surface is decreased , the average radial component of the field will increase while the non - radial contribution will decrease . changing the source surface",
    "therefore modifies the field structure of the whole corona , such that , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fieldlines ] ) , increasing the source surface lead to field lines that have a smaller radial component and are therefore rounder .    for each given surface map ,",
    "therefore , the source surface is the one free parameter in determining the structure of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "whatever value is chosen for this , however , the dominantly octupolar nature of the magnetic field close to the surface remains , as does the transition to a dipolar field at greater heights .",
    "this transition can be seen in fig .",
    "[ meanb ] where the radial field falls off with height as @xmath33 ( appropriate for an octupolar field ) close to the star around 2@xmath34 , while a dependence closer to @xmath35 ( appropriate for a dipole ) becomes apparent only at heights greater than around 5@xmath34 .",
    "given the strengths of the dipolar and octupolar terms , we would expect the dipole to dominate at heights above 2@xmath34 .",
    "once we have determined the coronal structure of the magnetic field , we can divide the field lines into three types , depending on whether they are open , closed or possibly accreting .",
    "the only field lines that have the opportunity to accrete are those that pass through ( or close to ) the disk at a radius where the gravitational acceleration is directed towards the star .",
    "field lines that never pass near to the disk region may either be open ( i.e. wind - bearing ) or closed ( i.e. x - ray bright ) .",
    "clearly , with our field extrapolation technique we can not determine the fate of the field lines that pass through the disk .",
    "the nature of their interaction with the disk material will depend not only on the global disk properties , such as the mass accretion rate , but also on the small - scale physics of the plasma diffusivity and viscosity .",
    "an important factor is also the strength and geometry of the field lines that intersect the disk .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ b_disk_nopress ] ) the range of field strengths of those field lines that pass through the disk .",
    "models with a range of source surfaces are shown , some well within the keplerian co - rotation radius and some beyond it .",
    "for the models where the source surface is inside the co - rotation radius , material accretes from the source surface along open field lines . in this case",
    ", the fall - off in field strength is just what would be expected from fig .",
    "( [ meanb ] ) . for models where the source surface is beyond the co - rotation radius , however , we note that material can only accrete from within the co - rotation radius . in this case ,",
    "accretion takes place from a fixed radius along predominantly closed field lines whose field strength now varies much less with the value of the source surface .",
    "field lines that penetrate the disk beyond the co - rotation radius are likely to be sheared open , adding to the flux of field lines that have been opened up by the pressure of the hot coronal gas . in this case",
    "our model would underestimate the flux of open field .",
    "considerable progress has already been made in studying the interaction of simulated stellar magnetic fields with accretion disks @xcite .",
    "recent models of multipolar fields in particular show that accreting material may take the most energetically favourable path ( i.e. closest to the equatorial plane ) and so the form of the accretion funnels depends sensitively on the stellar field structure @xcite .",
    "the distortion of the field that will take place as it couples to the disk material is , however , beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of future work .",
    "our present aim is to determine as a starting point which field lines are capable ( by virtue of their location ) of connecting to the disk at all .",
    "we therefore consider field lines that pass through the disc within the co - rotation radius .",
    "we assume that the disc lies in the equatorial plane and is of opening angle @xmath36 .",
    "the interaction of the stellar magnetic field with the disc may lead to a warping of the inner disc @xcite in which case the disc may lie along the magnetic equator , rather than the stellar rotational equator .",
    "in fact , we have found that allowing accretion to start from the magnetic equator rather than the rotational equator makes little difference in this case , and so in the absence of any evidence for a warped disc in v2129  oph , we consider the disc to lie in the plane defined by the stellar rotation axis . along the field lines that pass through this plane inside the co - rotation radius ,",
    "we determine the density and velocity structure of the accretion flow .",
    "following @xcite we assume that the disc supplies mass at a constant rate .",
    "we use a spherical grid and assume that each grid cell within the disc which is accreting supplies a mass accretion rate that is proportional to its surface area .",
    "for example , if an accreting grid cell has a surface area that is @xmath37 of the total area of all accreting grid cells , then this grid cell is assumed to carry @xmath37 of the total mass accretion rate supplied by the disc .",
    "therefore , if grid cells which constitute half of the total area of all accreting cells in the disc carry material into a single hotspot , then half of the mass accretion rate is carried from the disc to this hotspot .",
    "in such a way the accretion rate into each hotspot is different and depends on the structure of the field connecting the star to the disc .",
    "simulations suggest that both the mass and energy flux will be greatest at the centre of the hotspot @xcite .    in order to calculate the variation in the density structure of the accretion columns of v2129  oph",
    "we assume that the field is not significantly distorted by the flow and that the accreting gas flows along the path of the field ( @xmath38 is parallel to @xmath39 ) so that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass density ( see e.g. @xcite ) . if an individual accreting grid cell carries material onto an area of the stellar surface of @xmath42 with velocity @xmath43 and density @xmath44 , then the mass accretion rate into @xmath42 is , @xmath45 it then follows from ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ mdot ] ) that the density profile along the path of the field line may be written as , @xmath46 the density profiles therefore do not depend on the absolute field strength , but instead on how the field strength varies with height above the star .",
    "the density profiles are typically steeper than those derived for accretion flows along dipolar field lines since the strength of a higher order field drops faster with height above the star ( see fig .",
    "[ denpro ] ) .",
    "gas is assumed to free - fall under gravity along the path of the field after leaving the disc with a small initial velocity of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the range of accretion velocities with which flows arrive at the stellar surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ vbar_error ] .",
    "we assume that accretion occurs over a range of radii , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the approach taken previously by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who have demonstrated that such an assumption reproduces observed spectral line profiles and variability .    in order to estimate the number density of gas within the accretion columns we require the temperature distribution along the path of the field lines .",
    "the temperature variation within the accretion columns of t tauri stars is uncertain .",
    "the most comprehensive model is that of @xcite who considers both heating and cooling processes .",
    "here we elect to take the simplest approach and assume an isothermal accretion flow temperature of @xmath48 - a reasonable estimate for the temperature of accreting material ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain the number density profiles from @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath51 the dimensionless atomic weight .",
    "[ denpro ] show sthe variation of the number density along the paths of a selection of accreting field lines , with those obtained for dipolar field lines shown for comparison .",
    "the changing nature of the accreting field lines as the source surface is increased becomes very apparent when we consider the path taken by the accretion flows .",
    "( [ mdot_spot ] ) shows the fraction of the mass accretion rate that impacts on the different regions of the stellar surface .",
    "when the source surface is very small , the accreting flow takes place along the complex smaller - scale field close to the stellar surface and impacts at a range of locations .",
    "as the source surface becomes progressively larger , however , the accretion takes place along the simpler large - scale field until most of the accretion is divided equally between two accretion funnels , one in each hemisphere ( see fig .",
    "( [ acc_fieldlines_xray ] ) ) .",
    "for the field lines that are closed and not interacting with the disk we can calculate the pressure structure of the corona , assuming it to be isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium . hence for a stellar rotation rate @xmath52 , the pressure at any point is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the component of gravity ( allowing for rotation ) along the field and @xmath55 at the loop footpoints we scale the plasma pressure @xmath56 to the magnetic pressure such that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant that is the same on every field line .",
    "by scaling @xmath58 up or down we can scale the overall level of the coronal gas pressure and hence the density and emission measure .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is a free parameter .",
    "following @xcite we choose the value of @xmath58 that gives the best fit when used to model the coronal emission of the stars in the coup dataset . the plasma pressure within any volume element of the corona",
    "is then set to zero if the field line through that volume element is open , or if at any point along the field line the plasma pressure is greater than the magnetic pressure i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "from the pressure , we calculate the density assuming an ideal gas and determine the morphology of the optically thin x - ray emission by integrating along lines of sight through the corona .",
    "this technique has been used for some time now to extrapolate the coronal field of the sun .",
    "comparisons of the resulting morphology of the corona with lasco c1 images show good agreement for much of the corona , except near the polar hole boundaries where the potential field approximation is likely to break down at the interface between open and closed field regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the best agreement with observations was obtained with a scaling of @xmath60 .",
    "the question of the optimal scaling is one that is often addressed in the context of the heating of the solar corona ( see @xcite and references therein ) and indeed recent work suggests that scaling laws developed on the basis of detailed solar observations may be extrapolated to more rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "the use of field extrapolation based on surface magnetograms obtained using zeeman - doppler imaging has been developed extensively for rapidly - rotating main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "comparison of the predicted coronal x - ray emission with chandra line shifts and emission measures confirms the usefulness of this technique @xcite .    one significant difference , however , between these main - sequence stars and t tauri stars is the presence of active accretion .",

    "@xcite have shown that for the actively - accreting t tauris in the coup sample , the observed drop in @xmath61 ( and its rotational modulation ) could be explained by the presence of dense accretion funnels .    in order to test this hypothesis with the derived magnetic structure for v2129 oph",
    ", we have calculated the density profiles along the accreting field lines and determined the x - ray emission measure as a function of rotational phase for a range of models with different source surfaces .",
    "we chose a coronal temperature of 3@xmath6210@xmath63k which is typical for stars in the coup database .",
    "a lower temperature would have given a lower emission measure , but the behaviour as the source surface is changed would have been qualitatively unchanged .",
    "the values of the emission measure , while high for most solar - mass t tauri stars , are typical for a star of this mass .",
    "the average value for the case of a source surface at 6.8r@xmath0 is @xmath64  which translates to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath65  .",

    "( [ acc_fieldlines_xray ] ) which is viewed at rotation phase 0.8 which coincides with the inferred location of the accretion hotspots . the effect on the x - ray emission is rather small because of the relatively low density of the accretion funnels , and the fact that the magnetic geometry of v2129  oph is such that there is a ring of x - ray bright field at high latitude which is barely obscured by the channelled funnel of accreting gas .",
    "( [ denpro ] ) shows the variation in the density for some sample field lines , for a model with a source surface at 6.8r@xmath0 and one at 2.5r@xmath0 . in each case , the corresponding density profile for dipolar field lines is also shown .",
    "the larger the source surface becomes , the more dipolar do the density profiles become . in both cases",
    ", however , the density close to the stellar surface is similar and is of a magnitude such that scattering from the accretion funnels can reduce the x - ray luminosity , although the predicted rotational modulation for this moderate accretor is only of order 10@xmath1 at most .",
    "( [ emrange ] ) shows the corresponding x - ray emission measure for this set of models when the accretion funnels are present and also when they are neglected . in both cases , increasing the source surface initially increases the emission measure as the volume of the closed corona increases , but once the source surface extends beyond the co - rotation radius , the maximum extent of the closed corona is limited to the co - rotation radius and so the emission measure becomes independent of the source surface .",
    "the degree of rotational modulation of the x - ray emission measure also varies with the value of the source surface . as fig .",
    "( [ acc_fieldlines_xray ] ) shows , however , the octupolar structure of the field results in a ring of emission at high latitudes . due to the inclination of the star ( @xmath67 ) this ring is almost always in view as the star rotates , and hence , as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ emphase2 ] ) , the rotational modulation is small .",

    ", the location of the minimum also varies slightly , being closer to phase 0.8 when the source surface is larger .",
    "the difference is simply due to the alteration in the shape of the field lines as the source surface is changed . in this case , the field lines that are accreting connect to the star at slightly higher latitudes and later phases when the source surface is moved out .",

    "the other free parameter of our model is the value of the source surface where the outward pressure of the coronal gas is assumed to have opened up all of the magnetic field lines .",
    "we have taken a range of values for the source surface , from one well inside the co - rotation radius ( which ensures that all field lines at co - rotation are open ) to one well beyond the co - rotation radius ( which ensures that there is a mixture of open and closed field lines at co - rotation ) .",
    "the principal difference in the accretion process as we increase the value of the source surface is that accretion takes place along progressively simpler field structures and impacts on progressively fewer sites at the stellar surface .",
    "we find that in order to have the majority of the accretion impacting on a single high - latitude site in each hemisphere , we need to place the source surface beyond approximately 7r@xmath0 , close to the keplerian co - rotation radius at 6.8r@xmath0 . at this distance from the star ,",
    "the magnetic field lines that intersect the disk have a strength of only a few gauss and are certainly weak enough to be overwhelmed by the ram pressure of the accreting gas .    as the source surface",
    "is increased and the extent of the closed - field corona increases , we find that the magnitude of the predicted x - ray emission measure increases , and its rotational modulation also increases .",
    "rotational modulation can be caused either by self - eclipse of x - ray bright regions , or by scattering from the accretion funnels themselves . for v2129 oph",
    ", this predicted rotational modulation is small ( only around 10@xmath1 at most ) partly because the x - ray bright regions remain in view as the star rotates , and partly because it is only a moderate accretor and so the density in the accretion funnels is relatively small .",
    "v2129  oph is a young star in which a small radiative core appears to have already formed . for this star , the dynamo produces a field that is predominantly antisymmetric , with a complex surface distribution of polarities",
    "in which the strongest mode is that of a 1.2 kg octupole .",
    "a weaker dipole component is also present , with polar strength of 0.35 kg . by extrapolating this surface field into the corona",
    ", we have been able to determine the form of the field at a range of distances from the surface .",
    "the observation that accretion takes place mainly at one range of longitudes , into a region of positive polarity at the surface , suggest that at the field at the inner edge of the disk is much simpler than the surface field .",
    "this constrains the rate at which the field complexity decays with height and sets the limit of the closed - field corona at a height close to the co - rotation radius of 6.8r@xmath0 which is consistent with traditional disk - locking models for star - disk interaction @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the predictions of @xcite that for a t tauri star of this mass , the closed - field corona should extend out to approximately the co - rotation radius .",
    "the fact that such a relatively weak dipolar component is able to trigger accretion as far out as the co - rotation radius remains a challenge for accretion models which have traditionally considered purely dipolar fields .",
    "progress is being made , however , in modelling more complex field topologies @xcite .",
    "thus , although fig .",
    "[ acc_fieldlines_xray ] shows that the x - ray emission is concentrated within a height of  1r@xmath0 above the surface , the closed - field corona extends out much further .",
    "the degree of field complexity that might be inferred by tracing the x - ray bright loops is much greater than that seen in the accreting loops .",
    "this has parallels in the solar case , where the x - ray corona is compact and very highly structured , while the k - corona , which is also composed of gas at 10@xmath68k trapped on closed field lines , is much smoother and extends out to typically 2.5r@xmath69 .",
    "the solar k - corona is not detected in x - rays because the density of the gas at these distance is too low . in a similar manner",
    ", v2129 oph also appears to produce a large - scale , simple corona which is not apparent in the x - ray images , but which is in some sense `` illuminated '' by the accretion flows along it , without which it may have passed undetected .",
    "more observations of t tauri stars of different masses and evolutionary states are needed to determine if this field structure is particular to young stars with radiative cores , or if it is also seen on fully - convective stars which may produce magnetic fields through a different type of dynamo .",
    "simultaneous phase resolved x - ray and spectropolarimetric observations are also needed to determine if x - ray light curve eclipses are indeed visible in accreting systems and if they occur at the phases predicted on the basis of the derived magnetic field structures .",
