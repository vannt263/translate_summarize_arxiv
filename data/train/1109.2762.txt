    "we are interested in this article in the large time behavior of solutions of first - order hamilton - jacobi equations , set in a bounded domain with nonlinear neumann boundary conditions , including the case of dynamical boundary conditions .",
    "the main originality of this paper is twofold : on one hand , we obtain results for these nonlinear neumann type problems in their full generality , with minimal assumptions ( at least we think so ) and , on the other hand , we provide two types of proofs following the two classical approaches for these asymptotic problems : the first one by the pde methods which has the advantages of allowing to treat cases when the hamiltonians are non - convex , the second one by an optimal control / dynamical system approach which gives a little bit more precise description of the involved phenomena .",
    "for cauchy - neumann problems with linear neumann boundary conditions , the asymptotic behavior has been established very recently and independently by the second author in @xcite by using the dynamical approach and the first and third authors in @xcite by using the pde approach .    in order to be more specific ,",
    "we introduce the following initial - boundary value problems     u_t+h(x , du)= 0 & in @xmath0 , + b(x , du)=0 & on @xmath1 , + u(x,0)=u_0(x ) & on @xmath2    and     u_t+h(x , du)= 0 & in @xmath0 , + u_t+b(x , du)=0 & on @xmath1 , + u(x,0)=u_0(x ) & on @xmath2 ,    where @xmath3 is a bounded domain of @xmath4 with a @xmath5-boundary and @xmath6 is a real - valued unknown function on @xmath7 .",
    "we , respectively , denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 its time derivative and gradient with respect to the space variable .",
    "the functions @xmath10 are given real - valued continuous function on @xmath11 ; more precise assumptions on @xmath12 and @xmath13 will be given at the beginning of section  [ preliminary ] .    throughout this article , we are going to treat these problems by using the theory of viscosity solutions and thus the term  viscosity \" will be omitted henceforth .",
    "we also point out that the boundary conditions have to be understood in the viscosity sense : we refer the reader to the `` user s guide to viscosity solutions '' @xcite for a precise definition which is not recalled here .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of solutions of ( cn ) or ( dbc ) are already well known .",
    "we refer to the articles @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the standard asymptotic behavior , as @xmath14 , for solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations is the following : the solution @xmath15 is expected to look like @xmath16 where the constant @xmath17 and the function @xmath18 are solutions of an _ additive eigenvalue _ or _ ergodic problem_. in our case , we have two different ergodic problems for ( cn ) and ( dbc ) : indeed , looking for a solution of the form @xmath19 for ( cn ) , where @xmath20 is constant and @xmath21 a function defined on @xmath2 , leads to the equation    ( e1 ) h(x , dw(x))= a & in @xmath3 , + b(x , dw(x))=0 & on @xmath22    while , for ( dbc ) , the function @xmath21 has to satisfy    ( e2 ) h(x , dw(x))= a & in @xmath3 , + b(x , dw(x))= a & on @xmath22 .",
    "we point out that one seeks , here , for a pair @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath21 is a solution of ( e1 ) or ( e2 ) . if @xmath23 is such a pair , we call @xmath21 an _ additive eigenfunction _ or _ ergodic function _ and @xmath20 an _ additive eigenvalue _ or _ ergodic constant_.    a typical result , which was first proved for hamilton - jacobi equations set in @xmath4 in the periodic case by p .-",
    "lions , g. papanicolaou and s. r. s. varadhan @xcite , is that there exists a unique constant @xmath26 for which this problem has a _ bounded _",
    "solution , while the associated solution @xmath21 may not be unique , even up to an additive constant .",
    "this non - uniqueness feature is a key difficulty in the study of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the main results of this article are the following : under suitable ( and rather general ) assumptions on @xmath12 and @xmath13 + ( i ) there exists a unique constant @xmath17 such that ( e1 ) ( resp . , ( e2 ) ) has a solution in @xmath27 .",
    "+ ( ii ) if @xmath6 is a solution of ( cn ) ( resp . , ( dbc ) ) , then there exists a solution @xmath28 of ( e1 ) ( resp . , ( e2 ) ) , such that @xmath29    the rest of this paper consists in making these claims more precise by providing the correct assumptions on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , by recalling the main existence and uniqueness results on ( cn ) and ( dbc ) , by solving ( e1 ) and ( e2 ) , and proving ( i ) and finally by showing the asymptotic result ( ii ) . in an attempt to make the paper concise ,",
    "we have decided to present the full proof of ( ii ) for ( cn ) only by the optimal control / dynamical system approach while we prove the ( dbc ) result only by the pde approach . to our point of view , these proofs are the most relevant one , the two other proofs following along the same lines and being even simpler .    in the last decade , the large time behavior of solutions of hamilton - jacobi equation in compact manifold @xmath30 ( or in @xmath31 , mainly in the periodic case ) has received much attention and general convergence results for solutions have been established .",
    "g. namah and j .- m .",
    "roquejoffre in @xcite are the first to prove under the following additional assumption @xmath32 where @xmath30 is a smooth compact @xmath33-dimensional manifold without boundary .",
    "then a. fathi in @xcite proved the same type of convergence result by dynamical systems type arguments introducing the `` weak kam theory '' .",
    "contrarily to @xcite , the results of @xcite use strict convexity ( and smoothness ) assumptions on @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( and also far more regularity ) but do not require . afterwards",
    "j .- m . roquejoffre @xcite and a. davini and a. siconolfi in @xcite refined the approach of a. fathi and they studied the asymptotic problem for hamilton - jacobi equations on @xmath30 or @xmath33-dimensional torus . the second author ,",
    "y. fujita , n. ichihara and p. loreti have investigated the asymptotic problem specially in the whole domain @xmath31 without the periodic assumptions in various situations by using the dynamical approach which is inspired by the weak kam theory .",
    "see @xcite . the first author and p. e. souganidis obtained in @xcite more general results , for possibly non - convex hamiltonians , by using an approach based on partial differential equations methods and viscosity solutions , which was not using in a crucial way the explicit formulas of representation of the solutions",
    "later , by using partially the ideas of @xcite but also of @xcite , results on the asymptotic problem for unbounded solutions were provided in @xcite .",
    "there also exists results on the asymptotic behavior of solutions of convex hamilton - jacobi equation with boundary conditions .",
    "the third author @xcite studied the case of the state constraint boundary condition and then the dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "roquejoffre in @xcite was also dealing with solutions of the cauchy - dirichlet problem which satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition pointwise ( in the classical sense )  : this is a key difference with the results of @xcite where the solutions were satisfying the dirichlet boundary condition in a generalized ( viscosity solutions ) sense .",
    "these results were slightly extended in @xcite by using an extension of pde approach of @xcite .",
    "we also refer to the articles @xcite for the large time behavior of solutions to time - dependent hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "recently e. yokoyama , y. giga and p. rybka in @xcite and the third author with y. giga and q. liu in @xcite has gotten the large time behavior of solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations with noncoercive hamiltonian which is motivated by a model describing growing faceted crystals .",
    "we refer to the article @xcite for the large - time asymptotics of solutions of nonlinear neumann - type problems for viscous hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ preliminary ] we state the precise assumptions on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as well as some preliminary results on ( cn ) , ( dbc ) , ( e1 ) and ( e2 ) .",
    "section [ pde ] is devoted to the proof of convergence results by the pde approach . in section [ dsa ]",
    "we devote ourselves to the proof of convergence results by the optimal control / dynamical system approach .",
    "then we need to give the variational formulas for solutions of ( cn ) and ( dbc ) and results which are related to the weak kam theory , which are new and interesting themselves .",
    "in appendix we give the technical lemma which is used in section [ pde ] and the proofs of basic results which are presented in section [ preliminary ] .    before closing the introduction",
    ", we give a few comments about our notation .",
    "we write @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for @xmath42 for @xmath43",
    "we denote by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 the space of real - valued continuous , lower semicontinuous , upper semicontinuous , lipschitz continuous and on @xmath48 with values in @xmath13 , respectively . for @xmath49",
    "we denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 the set of all measurable functions whose absolute value raised to the @xmath52-th power has finite integral and which are bounded almost everywhere on @xmath48 with values in @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we write @xmath53 for the sets of @xmath54-th continuous differentiable functions for @xmath55 . for",

    "we call a function @xmath60 a modulus if it is continuous and nondecreasing on @xmath61 and vanishes at the origin .",
    "in this section , we introduce the key assumptions on @xmath62 and we present basic pde results on ( cn ) and ( dbc ) ( existence , comparison , ... , etc . ) which will be used throughout this article . the proofs",
    "are given in the appendix .",
    "we use the following assumptions .",
    "* @xmath3 is a bounded domain of @xmath4 with a @xmath5-boundary .    in the sequel ,",
    "we denote by @xmath63 a @xmath64-defining function for @xmath3 , i.e. a @xmath64-function which is negative in @xmath3 , positive in the complementary of @xmath2 and which satisfies @xmath65 on @xmath22 .",
    "such a function exists because of the regularity of @xmath66 if @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the unit outward normal vector to @xmath22 at @xmath70 in order to simplify the presentation and notations , we will use below the notation @xmath71 for @xmath72 , even if @xmath73 is not on @xmath22 .",
    "of course , if @xmath74 , @xmath75 is still an outward normal vector to @xmath22 at @xmath73 , by assumption @xmath75 does not vanish on @xmath22 but it is not anymore a unit vector .",
    "* the function @xmath12 is continuous and coercive , i.e. , @xmath76 , there exists a constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "* there exists @xmath81 such that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "* there exists a constant @xmath87 such that @xmath88 for any @xmath83 and @xmath89 .",
    "* the function @xmath90 is convex for any @xmath83 .",
    "we briefly comment these assumptions .",
    "assumption ( a1 ) is classical when considering the large time behavior of solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations since it is crucial to solve ergodic problems .",
    "assumption ( a2 ) is a non - restrictive technical assumption while ( a3)-(a4 ) are ( almost ) the definition of a nonlinear neumann boundary condition .",
    "finally the convexity assumption ( a5 ) on @xmath13 will be necessary to obtain the convergence result .",
    "we point out that the requirements on the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath73 are rather weak : this is a consequence of the fact that , because of ( a1 ) , we will deal ( essentially ) with lipschitz continuous solutions ( up to a regularization of the subsolution by sup - convolution in time .",
    "therefore the assumptions are weaker than in the classical results ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a typical example for @xmath13 is the boundary condition arising in the optimal control of processes with reflection which has control parameters : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a compact metric space , @xmath93 are given continuous functions and @xmath94 is a continuous vector field which is oblique to @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath95 for any @xmath83 and @xmath96 .",
