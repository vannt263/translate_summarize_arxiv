    "quantum systems that are chaotic in the classical limit exhibit universal behaviour , for example for the transport through quantum dots @xcite . for open systems ,",
    "the transport properties are encoded in the scattering matrix connecting the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions in the leads .",
    "if we imagine a chaotic cavity attached to two scattering leads carrying @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels respectively , with a total of @xmath2 , then the scattering matrix separates into four blocks @xmath3 of particular interest are the transmission eigenvalues and their moments @xmath4^n$ ] given in terms of the transmission subblock of the scattering matrix .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues relate to electronic transport through the cavity , like the conductance which is proportional to their first moment @xcite and the power of the shot noise which is related to their second .    to obtain a handle on the transport moments",
    ", one can employ the semiclassical approximation for the elements of the scattering matrix @xcite @xmath5 in terms of all the classical scattering trajectories @xmath6 that connect the corresponding channels .",
    "they contribute with their stability amplitude @xmath7 and a phase involving their action @xmath8 while @xmath9 is the escape rate of the corresponding classical system .",
    "the first moment of the transmission eigenvalues then follows from a sum over pairs of trajectories which start in the same channel in one lead and end in the same channel in the other @xmath10 \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\nl}\\sum_{o=1}^{\\nr}\\sum_{\\substack{\\gamma ( i \\to o ) \\cr \\gamma ' ( i \\to o ) } }   a_{\\gamma}a^{*}_{\\gamma'}\\rme^{\\frac{\\rmi}{\\hbar}\\left(s_{\\gamma}-s_{\\gamma'}\\right ) } .\\ ] ] this fluctuates as the energy is varied and as we are particularly interested in the statistics of the transmission eigenvalues , we average over a range of energies .",
    "the averaging over the phase difference picks out pairs of trajectories with highly similar actions and indeed when the trajectories are identical ( @xmath11 ) , one recovers the contribution @xmath12 @xcite which is the leading order term of an expansion in @xmath13 of the full result .",
    "the next order term was discovered to follow from trajectories that come close to themselves in an ` encounter ' as they travel through the cavity @xcite . a partner trajectory",
    "can then be found which is nearly identical , but which traverses the encounter differently .",
    "together these pairs provide the weak localisation correction @xmath14 for systems with time reversal symmetry .",
    "higher order corrections came from more complicated pairs of trajectories which are nearly identical in long stretches called ` links ' while differing in small encounter regions and which could be summed to give the complete result for the first moment @xcite .",
    ", we obtain the possible trajectory configuration in ( b ) , here shown with the trajectories tunneling through the barrier . removing the paths on the left of the encounter",
    "can be represented by leaving stubs in the tree diagram as in ( e ) .",
    "moving the encounter to the outgoing lead provides the structure in ( c ) or the tree diagram in ( f).,scaledwidth=73.0% ]    the semiclassical treatment of the first two moments and other correlations functions @xcite led to diagrammatic rules where the contribution of any diagram could be read off from its structure .",
    "in particular , each link provides a factor of @xmath13 , each encounter a factor of @xmath15 and each channel in the first or second lead a factor of @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the main leading order diagram for the second moment of the transmission eigenvalues , which is pictured in ( a ) then provides a contribution of @xmath16 . from this diagram",
    "it is further possible to shift the encounter to the left until it enters the incoming lead as in ( b ) .",
    "we note that this picture of encounters moving into leads actually derives from the semiclassical treatment of ehrenfest time effects @xcite where the remnant of the encounter provides an ehrenfest time dependent factor which ensures the unitarity of the transport",
    ". however , when the ehrenfest time is small compared to the dwell time ( the typical time that trajectories spend inside the cavity ) , the semiclassical contribution is as if the encounter is removed entirely and the channels in the lead coincide .",
    "the configuration in ( b ) then has @xmath17 and provides a contribution of @xmath18 .",
    "likewise , the corresponding case of moving the encounter into the outgoing lead in ( c ) provides the contribution @xmath19 .",
    "these three cases are the only possibilities at leading order , giving a total of @xmath20 with @xmath21 .    with the diagrammatic rules ,",
    "the problem of calculating the moments reduces to that of finding all the possible diagrams , which was performed for the first two moments @xcite through the connection to correlated periodic orbits which contribute to spectral statistics of closed systems @xcite . for higher moments instead ,",
    "the leading order diagrams can be represented as trees @xcite .",
    "for example , the trajectories in ( a ) become the tree in ( d ) while moving encounters into the leads corresponds to removing alternating links around the encounter node as in figures  [ secondmoment](e ) and ( f ) .",
    "since trees can be generated recursively by cutting them at nodes into sets of smaller trees , all the moments of the transmission eigenvalues @xcite and the moments of the delay times @xcite could be obtained at leading order in inverse channel number .",
    "this approach could also be adapted to include energy dependence and obtain the leading order behaviour of the density of states of andreev billiards @xcite .",
    "graphical recursions could then be utilised to obtain all moments of these various quantities at the next few orders in inverse channel number @xcite .    exploring the combinatorial interpretation of the semiclassical diagrams , it was recently shown @xcite that they always combine to give exactly the same results as those derived from random matrix theory ( rmt ) where the scattering matrix is modelled as having random elements and belonging to one of the circular ensembles @xcite .",
    "in fact the semiclassical diagrams can be related to factorisations of permutations , and one combinatorial interpretation for systems without time reversal symmetry ( corresponding to the unitary ensemble ) was derived from the periodic orbits of closed systems @xcite , while the other intepretation for all three classical symmetry classes reduces to primitive factorisations @xcite .",
    "this equivalence between semiclassics and rmt for transport was originally put forward in the late 80 s @xcite and rmt was first used to calculate the conductance and its variance @xcite with a diagrammatic approach later providing several leading and subleading order results @xcite .",
    "however , rmt also provides the probability distribution of the transmission eigenvalues @xcite and their moments are given by integrals related to the selberg integral .",
    "this connection more recently allowed the shot noise power @xcite and then various fourth moments to be calculated @xcite and brought a lot of interest to the evaluation of these integrals and the corresponding transport moments .",
    "various techniques were developed to obtain all the moments of the transmission eigenvalues @xcite and of the conductance and shot noise @xcite as well as of the wigner delay times and time delay @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the different techniques tend to lead to different expressions for the moments which are not so obviously related to each other even though they must be equivalent .",
    "similarly , the rmt and semiclassical moments must agree @xcite but the resulting formulae are different enough to obscure the equivalence .",
    "however , asymptotic analyses @xcite of the particular expressions for the moments obtained in @xcite have managed to recover the semiclassically calculated moment generating functions at the first few orders in inverse channel number @xcite .",
    "the above discussion was for the particular case where the leads couple perfectly to the cavity , but for the more general and important case when this coupling becomes imperfect much less is known .",
    "imperfect coupling often occurs in physical experiments in systems from microwave billiards to quantum dots and to make the theoretical treatment above of wider practical use we need to expand the framework to include the coupling . for this",
    "we add a thin potential wall or tunnel barrier at the end of the leads so that any incoming ( or outgoing ) particle is separated into transmitted and reflected parts , which was originally treated semiclassically in @xcite . here",
    "we show how this can be incorporated into the current graphical semiclassical framework @xcite .    on the rmt side the probability distribution of the transmission eigenvalues is currently unknown , with the state of the art being a cavity with one perfect and one imperfect lead @xcite",
    ". the moments are likewise generally unknown apart from at leading order when the leads are identical @xcite . for the delay times",
    ", the probability distribution is known @xcite but the moments have yet to be evaluated . in general",
    "only the weak localisation correction to the conductance and the universal conductance fluctuations @xcite along with the subleading contribution to the shot noise power @xcite have been derived diagrammatically .",
    "but these have also be obtained semiclassically by considering the diagrams explicitly @xcite a process we now show how to perform implicitly .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in we explain how tunnel barriers lead to modifications in the number of semiclassical diagrams and on the level of their individual contributions . in sections  [ trans ] and [ refl ]",
    "we derive , to leading order , the moments of the transmission and reflection eigenvalues .",
    "is devoted to the moments of the wigner delay times while in we consider andreev billiards with tunnel coupled superconducting leads as an important application .",
    "finally in [ subleading ] we work out the first subleading order terms for the transmission eigenvalues .",
    "introducing tunnel barriers leads to two main changes in the semiclassical diagrammatic treatment of transport .",
    "the first is that the contributions of the individual parts of the diagrams changes .",
    "the tunnel barriers can be treated probabilistically in the semiclassical limit so that trajectories have a certain probability to pass through each time they hit the barriers in the leads @xcite . in general this probability @xmath22",
    "can be different for each channel @xmath23 .",
    "for an @xmath24-encounter involving @xmath24 trajectory stretches of length @xmath25 which are close together , if the encounter hits channel @xmath23 in the leads , the joint survival probability of all the stretches is @xmath26 . over time , the survival probability of the encounter is @xmath27 with an escape rate of @xmath28 where @xmath9 is the escape rate of the same system without tunnel barriers in the lead .",
    "the diagrammatic rules for the contributions of semiclassical diagrams then become @xcite :    * each link provides the factor @xmath29 * each @xmath24-encounter the factor @xmath30 * each channel sum provides the factor @xmath31 or @xmath32 where @xmath33 counts the number of trajectory pairs passing through the same channel and @xmath34 the number of pairs reflected .",
    "for example for the moments of the transmission eigenvalues , a diagonal pair starting in a channel in the incoming lead and travelling together to a channel in the outgoing lead give the leading order term of the first moment @xmath35 \\right \\rangle= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\nl } p_i\\sum_{i=\\nl+1}^{n } p_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n } p_i } + o(1 ) .\\ ] ] with the same tunneling probability @xmath36 in each channel , this simplifies to @xmath37 with @xmath21 while the standard second moment diagram of ( a ) provides @xmath38 moving the encounter fully into the leads as in figures  [ secondmoment](b ) and ( c ) gives an additional @xmath39        the second main change with tunnel barriers is that many additional diagrams become possible @xcite .",
    "encounters can now partially enter the leads as trajectories can be reflected back into the cavity and are no longer forced to leave the system .",
    "staying with the simpler example of the moments of the transmission eigenvalues , from the diagram in ( a ) , we could move the encounter into either lead , let one trajectory pair stretch pass through the tunnel barrier and one be reflected as in figures  [ secondmomenttunnel](a)(c ) . from the channel sum of the encounter touching the lead ,",
    "we obtain a factor of @xmath40 or @xmath41 and an additional contribution of @xmath42 where the factor 2 comes from the two possibilities of which trajectory to let pass through the barrier .",
    "the total result for the leading order term of the second moment of the transmission eigenvalues becomes @xmath43 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle= pn\\xi(p+2\\xi-3p\\xi ) + o(1 ) .\\ ] ] our aim now is to systematically generate these additional possible diagrams , with their semiclassical contributions , for higher moments .",
    "as the moments of the transmission eigenvalues involve trajectories starting in one lead and ending in the other , the possibilities for moving encounters partially into the leads are somewhat limited .",
    "they can therefore be treated relatively easily by extending the treatment without tunnel barriers and here we mainly highlight the changes needed to incorporate them . at leading order in inverse channel number , the underlying semiclassical diagrams can be redrawn as trees @xcite as going from the top lines in and to the bottom lines .",
    "this framework has been further developed @xcite and detailed in @xcite .",
    "graphical recursions can be used to go beyond leading order and we build on that formalism here using generating functions as defined in @xcite . in particular we will obtain an expansion for the moment generating function @xmath44^n \\right \\rangle = nt_0 + t_1 + \\ldots\\ ] ]      to generate the leading order semiclassical diagrams , we start from the related tree diagrams where the encounters become vertices of even degree ( @xmath45 ) , the links become edges and the incoming and outgoing channels become leaves or vertices of degree 1 .",
    "the boundary walk of the tree allows us to recover how the semiclassical trajectories are arranged .",
    "for example , the trajectories in ( a ) become the boundary walk of the tree in ( d ) and vice versa .",
    "this also means that the incoming and outgoing channels must alternate around the tree itself . to generate the trees recursively",
    "we start by not rooting them in any channel so that these intermediate trees have an odd number of leaves and therefore come in two types .",
    "one type has an excess of outgoing channels so that , if it had a root , the root would be an incoming channel and we say that this type of tree starts from an incoming direction .",
    "for example , the tree in ( a ) is of this type .",
    "the other type has an excess of incoming channels and starts from an outgoing direction as in ( c ) .     and those with an excess of incoming channels as in ( c ) which belong to @xmath46 .",
    "by combining the top of the three trees in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) into a new encounter and adding a new link , we can create the tree in ( a).,scaledwidth=57.0% ]    we then let @xmath47 and @xmath46 be generating functions which count all trees ( including their semiclassical contributions ) starting inside the system from an incoming or outgoing direction respectively and not rooted in any channel .",
    "the function @xmath47 includes the trees in figures  [ treerec](a ) and ( b ) as well as that in ( d ) with the channel @xmath48 at the top removed . as the @xmath49th moment involves @xmath50 semiclassical trajectories with @xmath49 incoming and @xmath49 outgoing channels , by including a factor @xmath51 with each channel we can track which moment each tree diagram contributes to .",
    "the variable @xmath51 then becomes the generating variable so that later the coefficient of @xmath52 will give the @xmath49th moment .",
    "we can generate trees recursively since the trees start with a link which connects to an encounter of arbitrary size @xmath24 , while alternating below it are @xmath24 further trees of the same type as the starting tree and @xmath53 trees of the opposite type .",
    "an example for @xmath54 can be seen in ( a ) .",
    "similarly , bringing trees together in this way allows us to create all larger trees .",
    "trees can be brought together only if they all start inside the system , which is why we have this restriction on @xmath47 and @xmath46 .    without tunnel barriers , for @xmath47 we could further remove all the @xmath24 trees of @xmath47 type below the encounter and move this encounter into the outgoing lead , as in ( f ) .",
    "we include the contribution of such diagrams ( with the top channel removed again ) in @xmath47 , but since the start point of @xmath47 is supposed to be inside the system , the diagram in ( e ) is not included .",
    "such cases will be accounted for later .    with tunnel barriers",
    "the new possibilities for the encounter are illustrated for the second moment in .",
    "in general , touching the outgoing lead involves removing any @xmath34 of the @xmath24 trees and allowing the other @xmath55 to be reflected back into the cavity , as in ( f ) .",
    "the case @xmath56 just means that the entire encounter is reflected at the tunnel barrier and is already included in the semiclassical contribution of the encounter .",
    "the encounter could also move to the incoming lead with the first link from the starting point to the encounter reflected and @xmath34 of the @xmath53 trees of type @xmath46 removed to tunnel straight into the lead instead . this possibility is illustrated in ( d ) , while a diagram like that in ( e ) is not included in @xmath47 . again",
    "the case @xmath56 is already included elsewhere and we obtain the recursion relation @xmath57 the first line starts with the contribution of the smallest tree which is just a link that tunnels through into the outgoing lead as in ( b ) . in the first line we then add all the trees whose top encounter does not move into the lead . the remaining two lines count the possibilities that the encounter moves into the outgoing or incoming lead and @xmath34 of the stretches of the encounter tunnel straight through the lead ( with the remaining stretches being reflected back into the cavity ) . since the powers of @xmath51 count the order of the diagram , a factor @xmath51 is included with each tree which is removed along with a corresponding factor of @xmath36 to record that those links have tunnelled through the barrier .    in the recursion relation we can perform the sums over @xmath34 .",
    "since the @xmath58 in the top line of corresponds to the @xmath56 terms of both sums , we can simplify to @xmath59 where we further divided both sides by @xmath60 .",
    "neatly , the first two terms can be rearranged into the @xmath61 terms of the three sums over @xmath24 , so that the recursion reduces to @xmath62 for @xmath46 we likewise have @xmath63      to obtain the leading order diagrams , we now root the top of @xmath47 in an incoming channel .",
    "this also allows us to remove the top link and tunnel straight into an encounter in the incoming lead , so we can now add diagrams like ( e ) and ( e ) . of the remaining @xmath53",
    "alternating @xmath46 trees emanating from the encounter , any @xmath34 can also move straight into the lead .",
    "the generating function @xmath64 , which counts all the leading order diagrams with their contributions and divided by @xmath65 , is then given by @xmath66 performing the sums gives @xmath67      with the formulae in ,   and   we have a formal generating function for the leading order terms of all moments and we can expand @xmath47 , @xmath46 and then @xmath64 in powers of @xmath51 .",
    "however , with the sums over the different tunneling probabilities in each channel , it is difficult to manipulate the expressions further . to proceed",
    "we can make the simplifying assumption that the channels in each lead have the same tunneling probability of @xmath68 for the incoming lead and @xmath69 for the outgoing lead .",
    "equations   and   lead to quartic equations for @xmath47 and @xmath46 which in turn lead to the following quartic equation for @xmath64 : @xmath70t_0 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ s^2p_1 ^ 2p_2 ^ 2\\xi(2s-1)t_0+s^3p_1 ^ 2p_2 ^ 2\\xi^2 = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the generating variable for the moments since the @xmath49th moment involves trees with @xmath50 leaves .",
    "expanding @xmath64 in powers of @xmath74 we need to choose the correct value for the first moment , which is @xmath75 from .",
    "equation   allows us for example to consider the situation where only one of the leads has a tunnel barrier by setting @xmath68 or @xmath69 to 1 , as in the recently considered situation where the probability distribution of the reflection eigenvalues was obtained from rmt for systems without time reversal symmetry @xcite although with different tunneling probabilities in the channels in the remaining lead . with equal probabilities instead and @xmath76 , we actually obtain a cubic equation semiclassically @xmath77 which can also be obtained from through using @xmath78 and @xmath79 . the generating function in",
    "should then match the leading order moments found by integrating the corresponding transmission probability distribution to that in @xcite .      to proceed further we instead set all of the tunneling probabilities equal to @xmath80 .",
    "the quartic equation for @xmath47 now has the expansion @xmath81",

    "the quartic for @xmath64 reduces to @xmath84t_0 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ s(2s-1)p^2\\xi t_0+s^2p^2\\xi^2 = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and again for the expansion in powers of @xmath74 we need to pick the correct value of @xmath85 for the first moment ( since we divided @xmath64 by @xmath65 ) .",
    "the first few terms in the expansion are @xmath86 with the second term corresponding to the second moment calculated explicitly in .      as a further simplification",
    ", we can also have an equal number of channels in each lead so that @xmath87 . due to the symmetry we have @xmath88 , so reduces to @xmath89 where @xmath47 is actually given by the same quadratic as when there are no tunnel barriers in the leads .",
    "the moment generating function then satisfies the quadratic equation @xmath90 which is also a factor of when @xmath87 or @xmath91 .",
    "the moment generating function can then be given explicitly as @xmath92 where we chose the solution of which matches the first moment @xmath93 .",

    "however , a final result could be obtained if they assumed the two leads were identical .",

    "the result @xcite was @xmath94 semiclassically instead it is simple to have different sized leads , but with a constant tunneling probability in each . to compare the different results we can look at the common results for the simplest case of identical leads with a single tunneling probability . from the moment generating function in , including the 0th moment as 1",
    ", we can perform the hilbert transformation to get the probability density @xmath95 which is exactly with identical tunneling probabilities .",
    "that the distribution in for identical leads is a sum over the channels means that the moment generating function would likewise be a sum over terms like in again with different @xmath22 .",
    "semiclassically , with identical leads we have @xmath88 through symmetry , but this result still can not easily be seen from and . instead we have access to the complementary regime of different leads with equal tunneling probabilities",
    ".    we can proceed to higher orders in the inverse number of channels ( see @xcite ) by similarly modifying the approach @xcite without tunnel barriers .",
    "for example , we present the calculation of @xmath96 in [ subleading ] .",
    "however , the more interesting case occurs when we consider reflection quantities .",
    "when we consider the moments of the reflection eigenvalues , or their generating function @xmath97^n \\right\\rangle = nr_0 + r_1 + \\ldots\\ ] ] we now have a semiclassical approximation where the trajectories all start and end in the same lead . with tunnel barriers , this allows even more diagrammatic possibilities when moving encounters into the lead , and we may also have trajectories that never enter the system and are reflected instead directly at the tunnel barrier @xcite .",

    "at subleading order , the previous treatment @xcite could likewise be easily extended as in [ subleading ] , but apart from a computational expansion for the low moments , a generating function for all moments could only be obtained in the even more restricted case of equal leads and equal tunneling probability for all channels as in .",

    "this regime has only been investigated for fewer quantities at lower moments and order @xcite , with particularly interesting behaviour arising from the interplay of the tunnel barriers and ehrenfest time effects for diagrams contributing to the universal conductance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "diagrams at subleading order , like the example in ( a ) , all involve a loop traversed in opposite directions and therefore require time reversal symmetry .",
