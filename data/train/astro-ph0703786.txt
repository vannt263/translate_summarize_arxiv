    "the hess cerenkov telescope alerted the astronomical community on july 27 , 2006 about an increase of activity of the blazar pks @xmath0 ( z=0.116 ) in the tev energy range @xcite .",
    "the same night the blazar displayed flares up to 17 crab ( e > 200 gev ) on time scales of 5 minutes @xcite .",
    "an immediate x - ray / uv / optical follow - up with the _ swift _ satellite was activated and the analysis of data is reported in @xcite . a prompt increase of the x - ray flux without large spectral changes was revealed .",
    "interestingly , the frequency of the synchrotron peak remained at values similar to those observed in the past , with low tev activity @xcite .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , the event was so spectacular and anomalous that it deserves further attention .",
    "after an initial spectral fit of the x - ray data with power - law ( pl ) and broken power - law ( bpl ) models , we tried a log - parabolic model , which was already successfully applied to other blazars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this model is represented by the relationship :      where @xmath5 is the energy , @xmath6 the normalization , @xmath7 is the spectral slope ( photon index ) at 1 kev , and @xmath8 is the curvature .",
    "we applied this model to the _ swift _ observations with more than @xmath9 s of exposure on the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , which are listed in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the results of the fits are reported in table 1 , while the values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 versus the normalization @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the fits with the log - parabolic model are generally comparable to the values obtained by using single or broken power law models reported in @xcite . in a few cases",
    "the log - parabolic model gives a better fit than the pl and bpl .",
    "in other cases , the resulting curvature is consistent with 0 , i.e. the log - parabola mimics a pl .",
    "however , the limited photon statistic does not allow us to draw firm conclusions .        in fig .",
    "1 we display the curvature ( _ top panel _ ) and the photon index ( _ bottom panel _ ) plotted versus the normalization . the constant trend revealed by the data confirms the findings reported in @xcite : there was no significant spectral changes in the x - ray emission from pks @xmath0 during the outburst ( corresponding to increasing x - ray fluxes in fig .",

    "<S> at the end of july 2006 , the blazar pks @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) underwent a strong outburst observed at tev energies by hess ( up to @xmath2 crab flux level at @xmath3  gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ swift _ satellite followed the evolution of the source for about one month . </S>",
    "<S> the data analysis  reported in another paper  has shown that , despite the violent activity at tev energies , the synchrotron energy distribution increased in normalization , but only with a small shift in frequency . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we fit the broad - band spectrum with a log - parabolic model , to search for indications of intrinsic curvature , which in turn is usually interpreted as a signature of energy - dependent acceleration mechanisms of electrons .     </S>",
