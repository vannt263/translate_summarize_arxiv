    ", the problem of obtaining _ a priori _ estimates of the eigenvalues and their ratios has attracted a substantial attention .",
    "the existing results can be roughly divided into two groups  _ universal _ estimates , valid , as the name suggests , for all eigenvalues and all the domains in @xmath2 , which do not take into account any geometric information , and _ isoperimetric _ estimates for low eigenvalues .",
    "we briefly survey some known results below ; the reader is referred to the very detailed survey paper @xcite and references therein for a full discussion .      probably the first , and best known , estimate of this type is the payne - plya - weinberger inequality @xcite , @xmath10 this was subsequently improved by hile and protter @xcite , and , in 1990 s , by hong cang yang @xcite , whose implicit estimate @xmath11 remains the best universal estimate so far for the eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "the general method of obtaining and , as well as of similar estimates for a variety of other operators , has been the use of variational principles with some ingenious choices of trial functions , see @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative abstract scheme , based on the so - called commutator trace identities , which easily implies , in particular , and , has been developed in @xcite , see also @xcite .    by their very nature ,",
    "the universal estimates are generically non - sharp .",
    "both and give , for @xmath12 , the estimate @xmath13 this upper bound can not , in fact , be attained .",
    "already , payne , plya , and weinberger conjectured that the actual optimal upper bound on the ratio of the first two eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian is @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 stands for the @xmath16-th zero of the bessel function @xmath17 , so , in a planar case @xmath18 , @xmath19 compared with bound @xmath20 ) .",
    "conjecture was eventually proved , only in the early 1990s , by ashbaugh and benguria @xcite , using , in particular , symmetrization techniques going back to the faber - krahn inequality , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an @xmath23-dimensional ball of the same volume as @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to mention , in this context , extensive computational experiments designed to verify by haeberly @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , gives the full description of the range of the possible values of ratio of the first two eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian , @xmath24 for domains in the euclidean space ( the obvious lower bound is @xmath25 ) . in fact ,",
    "similar results were also obtained for domains in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "a natural extension would be to find optimal upper bounds on the range of the ratios of the first _ three _ eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian , @xmath28 , in particular for planar domains .",
    "in other words , we would like to find , for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the function @xmath31 and the number @xmath32 } y^\\ast(x)=\\max_{\\omega\\subset{\\mathbb{r}^{2 } } } \\frac{\\lambda_3}{\\lambda_1}({\\omega})\\ ] ] or their best possible estimates .",
    "we will use notation and when looking for maxima in particular classes of domains as well .    despite an apparent simplicity of this problem , and a wide attention it has attracted , it turned out to be rather difficult . in @xcite ,",
    "ashbaugh and benguria proved a complicated upper bound for @xmath33 and also demonstrated that @xmath34 their estimates improve upon previous results due to payne , plya , and weinberger , brands , de vries , hile and protter , marcellini , chiti , hong cang yang , and themselves ; see @xcite and their earlier papers @xcite for extensive bibliography and details of proofs .",
    "we present their estimates and other known facts in the next section ; just note at the moment that the lower bound in is attained when @xmath1 is the rectangle @xmath35\\times[0,a]$ ] with @xmath36 .    in the current paper",
    ", we describe extensive numerical experiments aimed at improving .",
    "we also show , using perturbation techniques , that the rectangle @xmath37 does not maximize the ratio @xmath38 and indicate a class of domains among which a possible maximizer could be found .",
    "the original suggestion to conduct numerical experiments on the range of @xmath28 for planar domains came from brian davies ; we would like to thank him , as well as mark ashbaugh and leonid parnovski , for valuable discussions and advice .",
    "it is the authors , nevertheless , who take full responsibility for the realization of this idea , and any criticism for possible shortcomings of this realization should be addressed to them .",
    "the spectral problem , admits a full solution by separation of variables when @xmath1 is , for example , a disjoint union of a number of rectangles or circles . for a reference",
    ", we collect below the results on the range of @xmath28 in these cases .",

    "other domains : :    there are other domains , like sectors of the annuli , ellipses , etc . ,    for which the problem of funding the eigenvalues is reduced by    separation of variables to the problem of solving some transcendental    equations",
    "however , the latter one is often not easier than the    numerical solution of the original problem , so we do not treat these    cases here .",
