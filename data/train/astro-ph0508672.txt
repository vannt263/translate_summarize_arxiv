    "the visible mass in a galactic disk is distributed in a thin disk , hence the planar and the vertical dynamics can be treated separately . the vertical distribution is not studied well unlike the planar mass distribution , though it is important to understand it since it acts as a tracer of the galactic potential and the disk evolution . the vertical distribution in a one - component , isothermal , self - gravitating disk was studied in a classic paper by spitzer ( 1942 ) .",
    "however , the physical origin of the thickness of stars and gas in a galactic disk and in particular their radial variation is not yet fully understood- we address this problem here .    in the past",
    ", gas gravity was often ignored even when studying the vertical distribution of gas , and the gas response to the stellar potential alone was considered .",
    "we show that stars and gas need to be treated jointly to get their correct vertical distribution . due to its low velocity dispersion , gas forms a thin layer and",
    "hence affects the dynamics and the vertical distribution of stars as well , despite the low gas mass fraction .",
    "the vertical scaleheight of hi gas in the inner galaxy is remarkably constant which has been a long - standing puzzle ( oort 1962 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the vertical scaleheight is a measure of equilibrium between the gravitational force and the pressure .",
    "hence the hi gas responding to the gravitational potential of an exponential stellar disk alone should show flaring , in contrast to the observed constant scaleheight .",
    "we propose that an increase in the gravitational force due to the inclusion of gas can decrease the gas scaleheight , and study this idea quantitatively ( narayan & jog 2002b ) .",
    "we formulate a general treatment where the stars , the hi gas and the h@xmath0 gas are treated as three gravitationally coupled disk components , embedded in a dark matter halo .",
    "thus each disk component experiences the same joint potential due to the three disk components and the dark matter halo , but each has a different response due to its different random velocity dispersion .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium along @xmath2 or the vertical direction for each component and the joint poisson equation are solved together .",
    "thus each component obeys : @xmath3 + { \\frac { 1}{\\rho_i } } \\large({\\frac { d \\rho_i } { d z } } \\large)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath4=1,2,3 denote the three disk components , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the mass density and the velocity dispersion respectively .",
    "the above three coupled , second - order differential equations are solved numerically and iteratively , using @xmath7 at the midplane and the observed mass surface density ( @xmath8 ) as the two boundary conditions in each case .",
    "this results in a sech@xmath9-like density profile for the mass density in each case , and we use its hwhm to define the vertical scaleheight .      on using the joint potential , the hi scaleheight decreases as expected , and",
    "is in a better agreement with observations ( fig .",
    "1 ) , especially at large radii where the effect of gas gravity is higher because of the higher gas fraction .    for h@xmath0 gas ,",
    "the joint potential gives a good agreement at all radii . in the stellar case ,",
    "the joint potential gives a nearly flat curve that slowly rises with radius with a slope of 24 pc kpc@xmath10 for 5 - 10 kpc , this agrees well with the near - ir observations ( kent et al .",
    "we next applied this general model to two external , prototypical edge - on spiral galaxies : ngc 891 and ngc 4565 , for which gas density values are known from observations - see narayan & jog ( 2002a ) for details .    from the pioneering study of the vertical luminosity distribution of edge - on spiral galaxies , van der kruit & searle ( 1981a ,",
    "b ) concluded that the stellar vertical scaleheight in a galactic disk is constant with radius , and this is explained if the ratio @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the scalelengths with which the stellar velocity dispersion and disk luminosity fall off exponentially .",
    "this has been a paradigm in galactic structure for 25 years .",
    "however , there is no clear physical explanation for this .",
    "we argue that such a strict relation is unrealistic in general given the different sources of stellar heating now known to operate in a disk , such as heating via scattering off clouds or spiral arms within the galactic disk , and via heating due to tidal encounters with other galaxies .",
    "hence , our model is applied to ngc 891 and ngc 4565 , treating the above ratio as a free parameter .",
    "the resulting stellar scaleheight is not strictly constant but instead shows flaring by a factor of @xmath1 within the optical radius ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this result agrees with observations ( de grijs & peletier 1997 ) .",
    "this is an important result for galactic structure .",
    "the multi - component approach developed here cohesively explains the observed vertical scaleheights of all the three disk components , namely the stars , the hi and the h@xmath0 gas in the inner galaxy .",
    "the above model is applied to two external galaxies , ngc 891 and ngc 4565 , and the resulting stellar scaleheight is shown to be not constant with radius , instead it shows flaring .",
    "such a moderate increase in stellar scaleheight is likely to be common in other galaxies as well ."
