    "global monopoles are heavy spherically symmetric topological objects which may have been formed by the vacuum phase transition in the early universe after planck time @xcite . although the global monopole was first introduced by sokolov and starobinsky in @xcite , its gravitational effects has been analyzed by barriola and vilenkin @xcite . in the latter",
    "it is shown that for points far away from the monopole s center , the geometry of the spacetime can be given by the line element below : @xmath2 where the parameter @xmath3 , smaller than unity , depends on the energy scale @xmath4 where the phase transition spontaneously occur .",
    "the spacetime described by ( [ gm ] ) has a non - vanishing scalar curvature , @xmath5 , and presents a solid angle deficit @xmath6 .",
    "although the geometric properties of the spacetime outside the monopole are very well understood , there are no explicit expressions for the components of the metric tensor in the region inside . , which on the other hand depends on the components of the metric itself @xcite . ] as a consequence of this fact , many interesting investigations of physical effects associated with global monopole consider this object as a point - like defect . adopting this simple model , calculations of vacuum polarization effects associated with bosonic @xcite and fermionic quantum fields @xcite , in four - dimensional global monopole spacetime , present divergence on the monopole s core .",
    "moreover , considering higher - dimensional spacetime , vacuum polarization effects associated with bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite quantum fields , also present divergences on the monopole s core .",
    "a very well known phenomenon that occur with an electric charged test particle placed at rest in a curved spacetime , is that it may become subjected to an electrostatic self - interactions .",
    "the origin of this induced self - interaction resides on the non - local structure of the field caused by the spacetime curvature and/or non - trivial topology .",
    "this phenomenon has been analyzed in an idealized cosmic string spacetime by linet @xcite and smith @xcite , independently , and also in the spacetime of a global monopole considered as a point - like defect in @xcite . in these analysis ,",
    "the corresponding self - forces are repulsive and depend on the square of electric charge ; moreover they present divergences on the respective defects core .",
    "a possible way to circumvent the divergence problem is to consider these defects as having a non - vanishing radius , and attributing for the region inside a structure . for the cosmic string",
    ", two different models have been adopted to describe the geometry inside it : the ballpoint - pen model proposed independently by gott and hiscock @xcite , replaces the conical singularity at the string axis by a constant curvature spacetime in the interior region , and flower - pot model @xcite , presents the curvature concentrated on a ring with the spacetime inside the string been flat .",
    "khusnutdinov and bezerra in @xcite , revisited the induced electrostatic self - energy problem considering the hiscock and gott model for the region inside the string .",
    "as to the global monopole the electrostatic self - energies problem have been analyzed considering for the region inside , the flower - pot model in @xcite and ballpoint pen in @xcite . in both analysis it was observed that the corresponding self - forces are proportional to the square of electric charge and are finite at the monopole s core center .",
    "differently from the electrostatic analysis , the induced self - energy on scalar charged point - like particles on a curved spacetime reveals peculiarities @xcite due to the nonminimal curvature coupling with the geometry . in the case of of schwarzschild spacetime , the scalar self - force on a scalar charged particle at rest vanishes for minimal coupling @xcite .",
    "the self - energy on scalar particle on the wormhole spacetime has been developed recently in @xcite . in the latter , the authors have observed that the self - force is zero for conformal curvature coupling , @xmath7 , for massless field .    in this paper",
    "we decide to the analysis the induced self - energy and self - force on a scalar point - like charged test particle placed at rest in the global monopole spacetime considering a inner structure to it .",
    "in fact , as first part of this investigation , we shall develop a general analysis admitting that the monopole has a non - vanishing radius , @xmath8 , and a spherically symmetric inner structure .",
    "as two different applications of this formalism we shall adopt the flower - pot and ballpoint pen models for the region inside .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following : in section [ self ] we present our approach to consider the geometry of the spacetime under consideration and present the relevant field equations associated with the scalar charged particle .",
    "the explicit formula for the self - energy will be also presented . as illustrations of the general analysis , in section [ applic ]",

    "many investigations concerning physical effects around a global monopole are developed considering it as idealized point - like defect . in this case",
    "the geometry of the spacetime is described by line element ( [ gm ] ) for all values of the radial coordinate . however",
    ", a realistic global monopole has a characteristic core radius ; for example , considering the model proposed by barriola and vilenkin @xcite , the line element given by ( [ gm ] ) is attained for the radial coordinate much lager than its characteristic core radius , which depends on the inverse of the energy scale where the global @xmath9 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath10 .",

    "moreover , for the metric spacetime under consideration the equation of motion above reduces to : @xmath27    taking the variation of ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor we obtain the energy - momentum tensor of the system : @xmath28 @xmath29 being the einstein tensor .",
    "the energy associated with the scalar particle reads @xmath30    for static fields configurations and by using the motion equation ( [ em1 ] ) , this energy reads : @xmath31 moreover , ( [ se ] ) can be expressed in terms of a bilinear function of charge density by using the three - dimensional green function defined by the differential operator in ( [ em1 ] ) : @xmath32 this equation becomes : @xmath33    considering now a point - like scalar charge at rest at the point @xmath34 , the charge density takes the form , @xmath35    finally substituting ( [ charge ] ) into ( [ e1 ] ) , we obtain for the energy the following expression : @xmath36    the evaluation of the green function that we need for the calculation of the energy is divergent at the coincidence limit .",
    "there are several methods to obtain a finite result . by the approach suggested by quinn in @xcite , one obtains a finite expression by using the _ comparison",

    "although we have started with a system in a four - dimensional spacetime , it becomes effectively defined in the three - dimensional section of the global monopole spacetime . in general",
