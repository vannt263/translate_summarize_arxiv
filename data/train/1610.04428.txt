    "in recent years , nonlinear optical phenomena through which light and elastic waves are strongly coupled have garnered a strong interest . amidst the various phenomena arising from the coupling of optics and elastodynamics ,",
    "a very well - known and studied example is stimulated brillouin scattering .",
    "spontaneous brillouin scattering is a nonlinear optical phenomenon by which light is inelastically scattered by the change in refractive index caused by adiabatic density fluctuations in a medium .",
    "these are due to thermal or quantum zero - point effects @xcite . on the other hand , in stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) ,",
    "the density variations are caused by the presence of light , through electrostriction , radiation pressure , and/or optical absorption .",
    "it is a third - order optical nonlinearity , whereby elastic and optical waves are coupled in a fluid or solid , mutually exchanging energy @xcite .",
    "while it has been known and experimented upon for several decades , recent years have seen a renewed interest in sbs and related effects , which already enable many devices , ranging from powerful sources and amplifiers to platforms for the study of slow light @xcite and nonreciprocity @xcite , and show great promise for future applications .",
    "there has been a growing body of literature on the previously unknown gain enhancements that can be achieved by specifically tailored nanostructures @xcite . in particular , it has been proven by theory and experiment @xcite that when waveguide geometries reach the nanoscale , previously unexpected , giant brillouin gain enhancements occur .",
    "these effects are so dramatic as to be 2 to 4 orders of magnitude larger than traditional theories predict ( 5 in the case of forward sbs ) @xcite .",
    "naturally , new theoretical tools have been developed to study and describe these phenomena both in waveguides and various resonant structures @xcite , which are understood to be due to a combination of surface electrostriction and radiation pressure . in hindsight , it is unsurprising that these effects only become predominant at the nanoscale , where the surface - to - volume ratio of particles and waveguides is so high . in these contexts ,",
    "perturbation theory in the form usually employed in electromagnetism can fail @xcite .",
    "these current approaches are all limited to rather simple , or highly symmetric , geometries , such as the aforementioned waveguides and resonators .",
    "an alternative to these methods , which require prior knowledge of the modes of the system , are full - wave simulations .",
    "one of the most prominent and widely used numeric techniques is the finite - element method .",
    "however , as we show , correctly simulating optomechanical effects in the frequency domain is far from straightforward , and the choice of frame of reference for the electromagnetic and mechanical solvers is of critical importance .",
    "navely overlooking this aspect leads to significantly inaccurate simulation results . in this work",
    ", we describe the problem in detail and propose a solution based on transformation optics .",
    "the key intuition is that the movement of material points and boundaries can be represented by an effective oscillation of electromagnetic properties .",
    "this simulation method is applicable to arbitrarily complex systems and geometries , which can be comprised of several materials , including metals .",
    "thus , it provides an extremely flexible computational platform for the design of optomechanical devices and artificial media , such as plasmonic and metamaterial structures @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe time - harmonic backwards stokes sbs in a solid medium . two time - harmonic electromagnetic fields ( pump and signal , labeled with the numbers 1 and 2 throughout the paper ) counterpropagate in a solid medium , interacting with an elastic wave of angular frequency @xmath0 and wavevector @xmath1 . for this process ,",
    "conservation of energy and momentum take the form @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate optical angular frequencies and wavevectors , respectively   and @xmath6 and to follow the same logical steps . ] .",
    "for ease of reading , but without loss of generality , we shall assume the solid medium to be isotropic , uniform , and electromagnetically non - dispersive .",
    "this last assumption is a reasonable approximation in the case of sbs , where @xmath7 . in the following derivations ,",
    "we consider the behavior of a bi - chromatic , time - harmonic electromagnetic field    [ eq : defeh ] @xmath8    where the tilde superscript denotes physical quantities which oscillate rapidly and harmonically in time , and for @xmath9    @xmath10    similarly , the elastic wave is represented by the vectorial displacement and scalar density variation fields    [ eq : defurho ] @xmath11      since solids in general support both longitudinal and shear waves , the mechanical aspect of the phenomenon must be described with fully vectorial elastodynamics . for finite - element mechanical simulations ,",
    "the natural choice for frame of reference are the material ( or lagrangian ) coordinates @xmath12 , which index the material points and assign a time - dependent displacement to each , without actually updating their position .",
    "by contrast , eulerian coordinates @xmath13 follow the position of material points through time .",
    "the two frames are related by the displacement @xmath14 through the relation @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eulerlagrange ] . the eulerian equilibrium equation , whose form is perhaps more intuitive , is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the instantaneous mass density , @xmath18 is the cauchy stress tensor ( referred to the current , deformed , geometry ) @xcite , @xmath19 is the gradient in eulerian coordinates , and @xmath20 is the sum of body forces ( forces per unit deformed volume ) .",
    "note that the finite linewidth of sbs resonance is due to a mechanical loss term , which can be thought of as included in the definition of stress ( by addition of a term proportional to strain rate ) @xcite .    , and displacement @xmath14 . ]    in a lagrangian frame ,",
    "the equilibrium equations assume instead the form @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial mass density , @xmath23 is the nabla in lagrangian coordinates , @xmath24 is the sum of body forces , given with respect to the undeformed volume , and @xmath25 is the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor ( referred to the undeformed geometry ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 , where the @xmath27 and @xmath28 tensors are respectively the deformation gradient and the second piola - kirchhoff stress @xcite . it is interesting here to spend a few words on @xmath27 and its properties .",
    "it is defined as the tensor relating eulerian and lagrangian coordinates @xmath29 and it is a function of the displacement @xmath14 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the identity matrix .",
    "the determinant of @xmath27 is related to the ratio of instantaneous density @xmath17 to the reference ( undeformed ) density @xmath22 : @xmath32 traditionally , most nonlinear optics textbooks such as boyd s @xcite model the mechanical aspect of sbs as simple electrostrictive volume forces .",
    "however , we want to stress that the computational method we present in this paper can be applied to arbitrarily refined descriptions of optical forces . following for the moment the traditional description , electrostriction in an isotropic , uniform medium ,",
    "corresponds to a potential @xmath33 @xcite : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 sign denotes a time average over an optical period , @xmath36 is the permittivity of vacuum , and @xmath37 is the electrostrictive constant , defined as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the relative permittivity of the material .",
    "the electrostrictive constant relates simply to the photoelastic tensor @xmath40 in the isotropic case through the fourth power of the refractive index @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian electrostrictive volume force is then @xmath41 .\\ ] ] a physical quantity of great importance that must be calculated from the solution to eq .",
    "is pressure , which is related to the cauchy stress tensor through its trace : @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "also useful is the variation in mass density @xmath43 , which is related to @xmath44 through the speed of longitudinal elastic waves @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "the electrostrictive volume force of eq .   can be entered into a finite - element solver as a weak contribution to the elastodynamic partial differential equation , which in frequency domain takes the form @xmath47      frequency - domain finite - element electromagnetic solvers are usually cast in eulerian coordinates , since for most applications there is no need to keep track of mechanical movements at electromagnetic frequencies . for an isotropic , uniform , non - dispersive medium",
    "the eulerian optical wave equation is @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the refractive index , @xmath50 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath51 is the permeability of vacuum , and @xmath52 is a polarization term that acts as a source for the nonlinear process .",
    "it can be related to a time - harmonic variation in relative permittivity due to a brillouin - related scattering mechanism as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electric susceptibility of the medium and @xmath36 is the permettivity of vacuum . in the traditional description of bulk electrostriction , the permittivity variation takes the form @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "representing @xmath56 in the frequency domain and using eq .   and eq .  , we can isolate the terms oscillating at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 re - writing eq .   in the frequency domain , and separating it into the components oscillating at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , yields :    [ eq : emfd ] @xmath60    where we have introduced the scalar wavenumbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which obey the dispersion relation @xmath63 , where @xmath49 is the refractive index of the medium .",
    "we have now described the electrostrictive sbs phenomenon through a set of mutually coupled partial differential equations , cast in the form that finite - element software most commonly solve for",
    ". however , there is a limitation to simply implementing the nonlinear coupling terms as weak contributions to standard differential equations : a computation solving the electromagnetic wave equation in eulerian coordinates is not by default able to account for the movement of the geometry , arising from the existence of displacements ( which are in turn computed in a lagrangian frame ) .",
    "this invariably leads to wrong results , especially at the nanoscale , where the effect of ( moving ) interfaces can play a dominant role @xcite .",
    "the obstacle could be avoided by performing a time - domain study instead , but it is in practice undesirable , because of the wildly different time scales of the optical and mechanical periods .",
    "thus , simulating solid - state sbs accurately would seem to be unreasonably onerous from a computational standpoint in the time domain and outright impossible in the frequency domain .",
    "to circumvent the difficulty described in the previous section , a possible strategy is to employ transformation optics ( to ) @xcite in a way that enables a standard electromagnetic solver to correctly account for the moving frame .",
    "the idea is to represent the movement of material points and boundaries by an effective time - oscillation of electromagnetic properties . in to , the material properties of an original ( isotropic , to simplify the discussion ) medium , unprimed in eq .",
    ", are transformed through the following relation :    [ eq : to ] @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation and @xmath66 is the metric tensor in three dimensions . the transformed permittivity @xmath67 and permeability @xmath68 are in general complex , symmetric rank - two tensors . in our case , the transformation is between a moving frame ( eulerian ) and a fixed frame ( lagrangian ) .",

    "more details on the derivation and explicit expressions for the metric components can be found in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .      for anisotropic , inhomogeneous material properties such as the ones typically yielded by transformation optics ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain an equation in a form as simple as a helmholtz wave equation . for time - independent properties one can derive an equation that resembles helmholtz s ,",
    "some form of which is in fact the master equation in many full - wave frequency - domain finite - element solvers @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are respectively the electrical conductivity , relative permittivity , and relative permeability tensor .",
    "our goal is to obtain a similar result in the case of time - dependent transformed material properties , in the form shown in eq .",
