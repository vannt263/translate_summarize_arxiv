    "an important and not well - understood class of supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the so - called thermal composite or mixed - morphology remnants ( mmrs , @xcite ) .",
    "these remnants are characterised by thermal x - ray emission that is centrally peaked whereas the radio emission has the familiar shell - type morphology .",
    "they have several other interesting characteristics : they are often associated with gev gamma - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is evidence for enhanced metal abundances in some of them @xcite although they are usually mature remnants , and they often show spectral features associated with strong cooling in the form of radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) or strong he@xmath2/ly@xmath2 x - ray line ratios of alpha - elements such as si , s and ar @xcite .    the centrally peaked x - ray emission of mmrs poses a problem for snr evolution models .",
    "they typically have an age on the order of 20.000 years and are therefore expected to have a shell - like density structure with a hot , tenuous plasma in the centre , based on a sedov evolutionary scenario . a flat interstellar matter ( ism )",
    "structure is therefore unsuited to create the centre - filled x - ray morphology that is observed , if the temperature is relatively uniform across the remnant .",
    "@xcite mention two possible scenarios for the formation of the emission structure typical for mmrs , the _ relic x - ray emission _ and the _ evaporating cloudlet _",
    "scenario @xcite .",
    "the former scenario is the most simple scenario , in which the outer layers of the remnant have become radiative and have cooled strongly so that they hardly emit in the x - ray band , whilst the centre consists of hot plasma that has not yet cooled below @xmath3 k. this scenario requires a high surrounding ism density .",
    "@xcite give a self - similar solution for a supernova that exploded in an environment where it is surrounded by a number of small , dense clouds .",
    "due to the large filling fraction and small size of the clouds they do not alter the dynamics of the forward shock , and they survive the passage of the forward shock due to their large density .",
    "the clouds then slowly evaporate due to heating by thermal conduction , which increases the density and decreases the temperature in the centre of the remnant .",
    "of these two scenarios , the relic x - ray emission scenario was preferred by @xcite to explain the morphology of w44 .",
    "one year later , @xcite used a similar scenario as @xcite to model the characteristics of the mmr w44 , but added a density gradient for the ism and thermal conduction .",
    "thermal conduction in the model by @xcite smoothes the temperature gradient from the centre to the outer layers , thereby reducing the pressure in the centre .",
    "a lower central pressure reduces the need to expand , which allows for a higher density to remain in the centre of the remnant .",
    "a problem with the scenarios using thermal conduction is that it is not a priori clear whether it can be important in snrs , since it is strongly suppressed by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "clear evidence for overionization of thermal snr plasmas is almost exclusively found in mmrs .",
    "thermal plasmas in supernova remnants are often found in an underionized state , and reach ionization equilibrium on a density dependent timescale @xmath4 s @xcite . due to their ages and their frequent association with high density regions ,",
    "mmrs are expected to have a plasma that is in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the fact that there is ample evidence for overionization , means the cooling rate of the plasma was faster than the recombination rate . how the rapid cooling proceeds is still unclear .",
    "efforts have been made to localise regions in mmrs which are cooling rapidly , as an association with a high density region may mean that thermal conduction is important .",
    "for example : @xcite find that the amount of cooling increases away from a molecular cloud for w49b , suggesting adiabatic cooling as the dominant cooling mechanism .",
    "@xcite suggest the cooling timescale of the plasma can not be explained by thermal conduction , and that adiabatic expansion is probably the dominant cause for cooling there . in addition , @xcite have shown that even at small expansion rates , simple adiabatic cooling combined with cooling through x - ray radiation can lead to a cooling rate of the plasma larger than the recombination rate .",
    "so far observational evidence for strong thermal conduction is lacking .",
    "the ionization state of a thermal plasma can be determined by using both the electron temperature @xmath5 and the so - called ionization temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the ionization temperature is the electron temperature that one would deduce from the ionization state of x - ray emitting elements alone , which may be different from the thermodynamic temperature in case the plasma is not in ionization equilibrium .",
    "when @xmath7 , the plasma is underionized , when @xmath8 the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) and when @xmath9 the plasma is overionized .",
    "there are different ways in which @xmath6 can be determined .",
    "@xcite determine @xmath6 by comparing the observed ly@xmath2 / he@xmath2 ratio of a certain element to the ratios of cie plasmas of different temperatures .",
    "the temperature of the cie plasma that produces the observed ratio is then @xmath6 .",
    "a different method was used by @xcite , who determined @xmath6 by using the cie model in spex to fit the plasma .",
    "this model has an additional parameter @xmath10 , compared to the xspec cie model .",
    "this parameter can be used to simulate a non - equilibrium plasma so that @xmath11 .",
    "finally there is the method used by @xcite and @xcite , who fit a plasma using the spex nei model with initial temperature @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 has a similar function as the ionization temperature , but it has a slightly different physical meaning as it describes the initial ionization state .",
    "the nei model then follows the ionization state as a function of ionization age as usual , assuming a rather sudden drop of electron temperature .",
    "note that although using the he@xmath2 / ly@xmath2 line ratios of alpha elements can show that a plasma is overionized , it has quite a large systematic error in determining the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is the result of the fact that there are emission lines of other elements which contaminate the he@xmath2 /ly@xmath2 ratio .",
    "the strengths of the contaminating lines are @xmath5 dependent , so that the systematic error is @xmath5 dependent as well .",
    "this can be taken into account by calculating the cie line ratios including the contaminating lines .",
    "the difference in ionization temperature between the line ratio and nei model methods is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tz_net ] .",
    "this figure shows the evolution of the ionization temperature as a function of ionization age , for an nei plasma that is cooling abruptly from 4 kev to 0.2 kev .",
    "it is clear from the figure that different elements show different ionization temperatures as the plasma evolves , so that a plasma can not be characterised by a single ionization temperature .",
    "this also explains why different elements in snr plasmas often show different ionization temperatures , as found by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand the nei model is not a perfect model for a cooling plasma , as it assumes the electron temperature instantly drops to a certain value .",
    "in reality the electron temperature will drop more gradual , so that the plasma evolution will be slightly different as a result of different recombination and ionization rates .    ]    here we present the first analysis of a chandra x - ray observation of 3c400.2 ( also known as g53.6    2.2 ) , which is an important member of the mmr class .",
    "this remnant has centrally peaked x - ray emission , as shown by einstein ipc and rosat observations @xcite .",
    "the radio morphology can be described as two overlapping circular shells of diameters 14 and 22 @xcite .",
    "this has led to the speculation that 3c400.2 might be two supernova remnants in contact with each other , which would make it a rare event .",
    "@xcite conclude however , using asca observations , that the remnant is the result of a single supernova explosion , based on the similar plasma properties found in the two shells .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations , including thermal conduction , show that the morphology of the remnant can be explained by a supernova exploding in a cavity , where the larger shell is a part of the remnant expanding into a lower density region than the smaller shell @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with hi observations performed by @xcite , who find a denser region to the northwest of the remnant where the smaller shell is located . in the optical",
    ", the remnant is characterised by a shell - like structure with a smaller radius ( about 8 ) than the radio shell @xcite .",
    "the optical emission is located in regions of low x - ray emissivity .",
    "optical emission suggest that those parts of the remnant contain radiative shocks , and are therefore cooling efficiently .",
    "distance estimates to 3c400.2 range from 2.3  6.9 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , the distance estimates based on radio data are obtained with the uncertain @xmath14 relationship , and the kinematic estimate of @xcite is based on interferograms of a small part of the remnant .",
    "we therefore consider the most recent distance estimate of @xmath15 kpc @xcite , which is based on hi measurements , as the more reliable one and we will use a round value of 2.5 kpc for the distance throughout this paper .    mmrs and in particular overionization of plasmas have gathered increasing attention over the past few years . in this work",
    ", we therefore aim to characterise the plasma properties of 3c400.2 in order to increase our understanding both of overionized plasmas , and the possible evolutionary scenarios of mmrs .",
    "we start with the data reduction and spectral analysis of different regions of the remnant , which is followed by a discussion on the measured plasma properties .",
    "we end with the conclusions .",
    "in this paper we report on the analysis of a @xmath16 ks archival chandra observation ( obsid 2807 ) taken on august 11 , 2002 with chandra observing in imaging mode with the acis - i ccd array .",
    "the total number of counts in the 0.3 - 7.0 kev band in the full spectrum is @xmath17k .",
    "we extracted spectra using the default tasks in the chandra analysis software ciao version 4.5 , using the task _ specextract _ to create spectra and weighted responses ( rmf and arf ) .",
    "we removed point sources from the spectral extraction regions .",
    "the spectra where grouped so that each bin contained a minimum of 15 counts .",
    "the remnant covers the whole area of the acis - i chips ( see [ fig : rosat ] ) , and there was no region available for background extraction .",
    "we therefore used the standard acis - i background files to create background spectra .",
    "we used spex version 2.03 @xcite for the spectral modelling .",
    "the nei model in spex is an extended version of the mekal model used in xspec @xcite , with the added advantage that the initial temperature of the nei model can be varied to mimic an overionized plasma .",
    "the chandra acis - i field of view covers the part of the remnant that is mostly associated with the smaller radio shell .",
    "it includes the brightest part of the remnant in x - rays , as can be deduced from the rosat image in fig .  [",
    "fig : rosat ] . with our spectral analysis",
    ", we aim to find differences in plasma properties between different parts of the remnant , and to investigate if this remnant conforms to the general properties of mmrs mentioned in the introduction , with regards to overionization and abundances .",
    "we fitted the spectra using absorbed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models , of which the parameters are the ionization age @xmath18 , the electron temperature @xmath19 , the elemental abundances and the normalisation @xmath20 .",
    "a cie plasma is identical to an nei plasma when @xmath21 @xmath22 s. in addition to the above listed parameters , the spexnei model has the initial temperature of the plasma , @xmath13 , as an optional parameter . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "putting @xmath12 makes the nei model mimic an overionized plasma , where the ionization state of the plasma is determined by @xmath13 and @xmath23 , while the continuum shape is determined by the electron temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the method to check for overionization using @xmath25 and @xmath26 line strengths is not feasible for 3c400.2 , since elements with isolated emission lines such as si and s show no significant @xmath25 lines in this remnant .",
    "we aimed to first find a satisfactory fit for the region covering almost the full area of the acis - i chips ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra ] ) , where we initially tried to fit the spectrum with an absorbed , single , underionized nei model with fixed abundances , freeing abundances only when it led to a significant improvement in c - stat / degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 was always allowed to vary .",
    "a single absorbed nei model was not sufficient to obtain an acceptable c - stat / d.o.f .",
    "in any of the extracted spectra , however .            the next step was to try to fit the spectrum with a double nei model .",
    "although the c - stat / d.o.f . improved significantly with respect to a fit with a single nei model , the fit was still not acceptable . the only way the fit of the double nei models became acceptable , was by allowing the @xmath13 of the cooler nei component to vary , so that @xmath12 , and therefore the nei plasma is overionized .",
    "we show in detail why the overionized model fits the data better than an underionized model in section [ sec : overionization ] .",
    "[ fig : full ] shows the spectrum of the full region . the best - fit model for this region",

    "it is clear from the figure that the high @xmath30 model accounts for the bulk of the fe - l ( 0.7 - 1.2 kev ) , ( 1.85 kev ) and ( 2.46 kev ) line emission , while the low @xmath30 model accounts for the ( 0.56 and 0.65 kev ) line emission , and continuum emission in the form of , and rrcs .",
    "the super - solar abundances of si , s and fe in the hot nei component suggest an ejecta origin for the plasma .",
    "the abundances of the high @xmath30 component as well as the emission measure have quite large errors .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the continuum shape at energies larger than 2.5 kev is not well defined by the data .",
    "an ill - defined continuum strength causes large formal errors in the abundances , since the strength of the continuum and the height of the abundances are anti - correlated .",
    "nonetheless the abundances are significantly super - solar , which means that 3c400.2 belongs to the group of mmrs with super - solar abundances .",
    "the ill - defined continuum at higher energies may be the result of the uncertainty introduced by the blank - sky background subtraction .",
    "overionization is found only in the lower @xmath30 plasma , and not in the high @xmath30 plasma . making the initial temperature a free parameter in the hot nei component",
    "did not improve the fit .",
    "there is therefore no evidence for overionization in the ejecta component , which is further corroborated by the absence of strong @xmath25 lines of si and s. the abundances of the low @xmath30 nei component are sub - solar in the case of ne and o and solar for all other elements , which suggest a swept - up ism origin for this plasma .",
    "overall the fit is acceptable at a c - stat / d.o.f . of 257 / 227 , although there are some significant residuals .",

    "it seems that the ionization state of si in the hot component is somewhat too high .",
    "this may be caused by the fact that this spectrum was taken from a large region of the remnant , in which in different parts the si may be in different ionization states .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] bottom right , where the hot nei component is plotted in a green dashed line , while the blue dot - dashed line represents the cooler nei component .",
    "the @xmath114 @xmath41 of the best - fit model for this region confirms the trend of increasing @xmath27 towards the nw part of the remnant .",
    "the plasma parameters of the hot component are equal within the errors to the temperatures of the full spectrum and the spectrum of region 2 .",
    "overall the model for this region confirms the notion of hot ejecta being confined to the central , brighter part of the remnant .",
    "from our spectral modelling we obtain the following .",
    "the overall spectrum is well - fitted by a two component nei model plasma , of which one is _ _",
    "under__ionized with a high @xmath115 kev and super - solar abundances of si , s and fe , while the other nei component has a lower @xmath116 kev , is _",
    "_ over__ionized and has approximately solar abundances .",
    "the central parts of the remnant show significantly higher abundances than the outer parts , which is apparent in region 1 , where no super - solar abundances are found .",
    "region 1 coincides with the optically emitting region , and shows the lowest electron temperature . although different parts of the remnant show slightly different plasma properties in terms of initial temperature @xmath55 and electron temperature @xmath5 , the parameters are consistent with a hot ejecta plasma confined to the central part of the remnant , which is surrounded by a rapidly cooling , overionized swept up ism plasma .      using the parameters listed in tab . [",
    "tab : full_param ] , we can estimate of the amount of x - ray emitting mass , both in ejecta and ism , present in the snr .",
    "the emission measure of the cool component is @xmath117 @xmath22 .",
    "we use a distance of 2.5 kpc and a spherical volume of the emitting region .",
    "the spectral extraction region has a radius of 6.67 arcmin ( 4.85 pc ) , which corresponds to @xmath118 @xmath119 .",
    "if we assume that the hot and the cool component are two separate plasmas , which both occupy part of the total emitting volume and which are in pressure equilibrium , we can get a unique solution for the density and shocked mass of the different components .",
    "the reason is that if @xmath120 = @xmath121 then also @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the number density . for @xmath124 = 1.2 n@xmath125 ,",
    "the number density @xmath126 of a component is given by @xmath127 , so that :    @xmath128    where em = @xmath20 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the above equation is equal for x = 0.4 , so that @xmath131 @xmath22 and @xmath132  @xmath22 .",
    "the respective masses are @xmath133  m@xmath134 and @xmath135  m@xmath134 .    the total emitting volume is uncertain , since the line of sight depth of the remnant is unknown and therefore the emitting volume might be a factor of two greater .",
    "note that the total mass in the remnant is larger than we calculate here , since the chandra fov covers about half of the total area of 3c400.2 , and we only estimate the mass of the plasma with @xmath136  k.    the total mass of ejecta and ism is quite similar to the mass found by @xcite , who found a mass of @xmath137  m@xmath138 for the whole remnant .",
    "this is surprisingly small for a mature remnant like 3c400.2 , even if the remnant would be located at twice the assumed distance .",
    "however , it should be noted that this is only the x - ray emitting mass , and most of the mass may in fact be ` hiding ' in the plasma cooled below @xmath139  k. the hot component , with super - solar abundances , only makes up a small fraction of the mass , and the total ejecta mass seems very low if it is the ejecta component of a massive star .",
    "however , here it should be noted that only the inner regions of a massive star have enhanced metallicity .",
    "the total metallicity is a function of stellar mass , with stars around 13  m@xmath140 producing only 0.3  m@xmath140 of oxygen @xcite .",
    "therefore a low mass of ejecta - rich material is consistent with a relatively low mass for the exploding massive star .",
    "this does , however , also suggest that the cooler plasma , which we designated ism , may partially or completely consist of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the star .",
    "an explanation for why , in particular , ejecta material remains hot needs to be addressed by detailed hydrodynamical simulations , which should incorporate the effects of the stellar wind of the progenitor .",
    "the low mass of the metal - rich component is also consistent with a type ia origin for the remnant . in that case",
    "the cooler component could be solely shocked ism .",
    "the enhanced iron abundances may indeed hint at a type ia origin , although the total mass of fe at an abundance of 15 times solar is still much lower than the h mass .",
    "in addition , the association with the hi regions in the nw part of the remnant makes a core - collapse origin more likely . to settle on the origin of the remnant",
    ", it would be important to reconfirm the distance estimate of 2.5  kpc by @xcite , as a larger distance estimate would favour a core collapse origin .",
    "it would also be helpful to identify a stellar remnant in 3c400.2 .",
    "the chandra image does not show any evidence for a bright point source that could be the cooling neutron star .",
    "the above densities suggest a hot , metal enriched , tenuous plasma surrounded by a dense , cooler plasma which is cooling rapidly .",
    "this is consistent with the shell - like density structure expected from a sedov evolutionary scenario .",
    "this is not the only mmr remnant in which such a temperature and density gradient is observed as @xcite also find a two temperature best - fit model and overionization in ic 443 .",
    "they find that the central ejecta region has a temperature of 1 kev , compared to 0.2 kev in the outer layers .",
    "however , overionization is present only in the central ejecta rather than in the outer layers , while we find overionization in the outer layers and not in the ejecta .    in the introduction we mentioned three different evolutionary scenarios that might explain the centrally peaked x - ray emission : the evaporating cloudlet scenario @xcite , the @xcite scenario with high surrounding density including thermal conduction , and the relic x - ray emission scenario .",
    "our observations show that the plasma is best explained by a low density , hot interior surrounded by a high density , lower temperature plasma .",
    "the total x - ray emitting mass is relatively low , for a mature remnant .",
    "but this is likely an indication that most of the remnant mass is not emitting in x - rays .",
    "in addition , overionization is only present in the cool plasma , suggesting that it is cooling more efficiently than the hot plasma .",
    "our results are perhaps most naturally explained by the simplest evolutionary scenario of the three : the relic x - ray emission scenario @xcite . as a result of the high surrounding ism density , the outer layers have cooled below temperatures capable of emitting in x - rays and the interior is still hot but has a low density and is therefore not cooling efficiently .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of thermal conduction , but we do not find evidence for overionization as a result of rapid cooling for the hot centrally confined plasma .",
    "moreover , the x - ray emitting plasma inside the remnant is clearly not isothermal , as indicated by the model of @xcite . as a final note",
    ", thermal conduction has mainly been introduced to models explaining the evolutionary scenarios of mmrs based on the then current observations of generally lower spectral and spatial resolution , which showed little to no temperature gradient in the remnants . however , more modeling is needed to understand whether local density alone determines if a remnant will evolve into a mmr , or whether some other conditions , such as pre - supernova evolution or ejecta structure , are important as well .",
    "the overionization of thermal plasmas can quite naturally occur in mmrs .",
    "the high initial ism density allows the plasma to reach cie on a timescale smaller than the age of the remnant , after which a combination of adiabatic and radiative cooling can make the cooling rate of the plasma higher than the recombination rate , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the higher surrounding ism density of mmrs might then be the determining factor for the occurrence of overionization compared to non - mmrs , as already noted in @xcite .",
    "indeed , all remnants cool adiabatically and by radiation , but not all remnants expand in a high enough ism density to reach cie and then overshoot to overionization .",
    "we have analysed an archival chandra observation of the mixed morphology remnant 3c400.2 .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows :    * the plasma of the mixed - morphology snr 3c400.2 is best fitted by a combination of a hot , underionized plasma with low density , and a cooler , overionized plasma with high density . to our knowledge , this is the first evidence for a combination of an overionized outer shell surrounding an ejecta - rich , underionized inner region in an mmr . *",
    "the hot plasma shows significant overabundances of fe , si and s , suggesting an ejecta origin , with fe enhanced in the central part .",
    "* overionization is significantly present in all parts of the remnant covered by the chandra field of view . *",
    "the x - ray emitting masses of the plasma components are @xmath133  m@xmath134 and @xmath141  m@xmath134 . *",
    "this low overall mass suggests that most of the x - ray emitting mass is from mix of metal - rich and hydrogen - rich ( envelope ) ejecta from a not too massive core collapse supernova , or the remnant has a type ia origin . * the observations",
    "are best explained by a scenario in which the centrally peaked x - ray emission is caused by a hot , metal enriched , tenuous plasma . due to the high surrounding ism density",
    "the outer parts of the remnant have cooled efficiently towards a temperature below which they do not radiate in observable x - ray emission . *",
    "the overionization can be naturally explained by efficient cooling due to a high ism density in combination with adiabatic expansion .",
