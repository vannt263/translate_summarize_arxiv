    "in quantum field theory spontaneous symmetry breaking achieves by means of either scalar field which develops a non - vanish vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) or dynamically produced .",
    "dynamical breaking of a symmetry was formulated by nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite . in their paper analyzed a specific field model in four dimensions as a prototype for studying chiral symmetry breaking in interacting fermion systems . in recent years studies of those models",
    "have been extended in various way @xcite ",
    "@xcite .",
    "after njl dynamical breaking was studied by gross and neveu ( gn ) in two - dimensional spacetime in the limit of a large number of fermion flavours @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these two models are similar but in contrast to the njl model , the gn model is a renormalized and asymptotically free theory .",
    "the relative simplicity of both models is a consequence of the quartic fermion interaction .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we investigated system of self - interaction massive scalar and massless fermion field with the yukawa interaction in @xmath1-dimensional spacetime . in the limit of a large mass of the scalar field",
    "the model becomes equivalent to the gn model .",
    "the results were obtained by the functional integration using method of the saddle point . we have found a phase transition in the model in the one - loop approximation .",
    "it was shown that the chiral condensate vanishes and the symmetry is unbroken if @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coupling constants of scalar and fermion fields respectively .    in this paper we study the chiral condensate beyond the framework of the one - loop approximation .",
    "we find that in contrast to the one - loop approximation excited scalar state begins to decay with the growth of the effective energy of system if the coupling constants do nt obey critical relation .",
    "in this paper we study a model with the lagrangian density given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a real scalar field , @xmath8 is a massless fermion field and the index @xmath9 runs from @xmath10 to @xmath0 .",
    "the potential of the scalar field is @xmath11    as it has already been mentioned above , the model is equivalent to the gn model in the limit of large @xmath12 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath13 the symmetry ( [ eq3 ] ) is broken either by the chiral condensate or by the scalar field which develops a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value . as it was shown in @xcite , in this model the chiral condensate",
    "is connected with v.e.v . of scalar field .",
    "we formally define the chiral condensate using the functional integral @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a normalization constant .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath16 the fermionic lagrangian is quadratic in the fields and we can integrate over them , getting @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ultraviolet cutoff . in order to integrate over the scalar field we decompose @xmath20 , where @xmath21 satisfies the classical equation of motion while @xmath22 describes small fluctuations around the classical background .",
    "then we take into account the quadratic terms of the scalar fluctuations @xmath22 , getting @xmath23 where @xmath24 the factor in front of the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is fixed at the point @xmath21 , and integrating over @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath25 the quantity @xmath26 is a chiral condensate if only @xmath27 is a ground state value of bosonic field which is determined by equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 the effective potential @xmath31 requires renormalization",
    ". therefore we renormalize it , following coleman and weinberg @xcite and gross and neveu @xcite by demanding that @xmath32 it is worth to note that in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime there is only one @xmath15-factor that appears in the renormalization of the scalar field mass , but the coupling constants obtain only finite contributions .",
    "then the renormalized chiral condensate is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is determined by equations ( [ eq9 ] ) , but for renormalized effective potential @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that the renormalized chiral condensate vanishes if @xmath36 or @xmath37 . in the latter case the discrete symmetry ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "is not restored , and the fermion field obtains a mass @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted that the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) describes the fermion multiloop contributions .",
    "this term gives an effect which does not appear within the one - loop approximation .",
    "really , after renormalizating the value @xmath39 must have the term @xmath40 which may be large negative value . then @xmath39 becomes negative value too , and effective potential @xmath41 obtains an imaginary part @xmath42 . in such a case",
    "some excited scalar states having an energy @xmath43 must decay . here",
    "@xmath44 is a solution of the equation @xmath45 .",
    "the ground scalar states are stable due to @xmath46 as we shall see below .",
    "our qualitative analysis we have verified by means of the numerical calculations .",
    "by numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) we have obtained the renormalized effective potential @xmath41 and the chiral condensate @xmath47 . the results of a numerical studies of effective potential are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] as a function of the scalar field @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters entering in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) take the next values : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the values of parameters were arbitrarily chosen as an example only .    , @xmath52 , @xmath51 .",
    "at the left from dotted line potential has an imaginary part . ]    , @xmath52 , @xmath51 and two different values of ultraviolet cutoff : @xmath53 ( solid line ) , @xmath54 ( dashed line ) . at the left from dotted line potential",
    "has an imaginary part . ]",
    "we investigated the behavior of the @xmath41 for different values of the coupling constant @xmath55 .",
    "the effective potential flabbily depends on the coupling constant @xmath56",
    ". therefore we do nt give it as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "besides , we have checked ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , that our results do not depend on the ultraviolet cutoff .     as a function of coupling constant @xmath57 for @xmath52 , @xmath51 . ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] dotted line separates the region where effective potential @xmath41 has an imaginary part ( at the left ) from the region where there is not imaginary part .",
    "the position of this dotted line strongly depends on the coupling constant @xmath57 . for the small @xmath57 the region of complex effective potential practically disappears ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the ground state value @xmath27 is always more than the value of the scalar field @xmath44 at which the imaginary part of effective potential disappears .",
    "therefore the only excited states with the energy @xmath43 decay .    the chiral condensate is presented in fig .  [ fig3 ] as a function of the coupling constant @xmath57 .",
    "we can see that the chiral condensate is equal to zero if @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the case of small @xmath57",
    "the phase transition appears as it takes place in the one - loop approximation . in the case",
    "@xmath59 the chiral condensate vanishes .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath60 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) ) , but the discrete symmetry ( [ eq3 ] ) is broken .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the dynamical symmetry breaking in model consisting of a fermion fields and a self - interacting scalar fields with the yukawa interaction beyond the framework of the one - loop approximation .",
    "we conclude that the model have a phase transition , as in the case of the one - loop approximation .",
    "besides , we showed , that the excited scalar states begin decay with the growth of the effective energy of system at the coupling constants do nt obey critical relation . here",
    "we recall that the phase transition appears if @xmath61 is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is a result of the multiloop contributions . in the model",
    "the chiral condensate vanishes at two different coupling constants @xmath57 . at the first of them",
    "there is a phase transition , at the second there is not . in the latter case the discrete symmetry is not restored .",
