    "the study of transport properties of semiconductor structures with many occupied electronic subbands has attracted scientific interest for a long time , concerning especially with two - subband occupancy and screening effects in the scattering processes @xcite .",
    "moreover , until recently these studies were made in inversion layers of si - mos ( metal - oxide - semiconductor ) structures @xcite in gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as selectively doped heterojunctions with two - subband occupied @xcite , where large - scale fluctuations of layers have small effect on the position of the energy levels and transport properties . recently ,",
    "new types of quantum wells ( qw ) , e.g. , modulation - doped qw @xcite , wide parabolic qw @xcite , and stepped qw @xcite semiconductor structures with two occupied subbands , have been grown by tailoring the conduction - band edge of iii - iv semiconductors .",
    "it was shown that these novel heterostuctures with double subband occupancy exhibit a much stronger effect of large - scale disorder on transport properties than the previously studied one - subband systems . for the new systems , the screening is effective only on the average of the external changes of the bottoms of the two occupied subbands , which are different from each other , and caused by smooth variations of qw parameters on the scale of the bohr radius as illustrated in fig .",
    ". only essential unscreened large - scale fluctuations of the both occupied qw levels are present in these systems .",
    "this paper addresses the effect of such non - screened variations of both occupied energy levels on the electronic spectrum and the classical magnetotransport by employing different confinement models : hard wall qw ( fig .",

    "short - range and small - angle elastic scattering mechanisms , within a local response approximation , are included in the linearized kinetic equation .",
    "we obtain effective magnetotransport coefficients , which are evaluated from the components of the local conductivity tensor averaged over large - scale inhomogeneities , up to second order in the disorder contributions to the conductivity@xcite , for zero temperature .",
    "in addition , we calculate the modulation of the effective conductivity by the transverse voltage .",
    "we take into account the difference between intra - subband momentum scattering frequencies and the inter - subband contributions .",
    "we investigate also the spatial variations of these frequencies .",

    "we discuss now our model for the energy levels fluctuations due to random inhomogeneities and we obtain the general expressions of the conductivity tensor based on the local response approach for nonideal qws with two occupied subbands .",
    "electron energy levels in a qw with slowly varying width can be described in terms of @xmath2 along with the in - plane kinetic energy given by the parabolic dispersion law @xmath3 with effective mass @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , the influence of nonideal heterointerfaces in the hard - wall qw , formed by large band offsets , can be studied by assuming that the qw widths , @xmath5 , are randomly varied .",
