    "the @xmath0 collider , hera , used to be the largest electron microscope of the world , where the inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) scattering of neutral and charged current ( nc and cc ) interactions has been studied over an unprecedented large kinematic region of bjorken @xmath2 and negative four - momentum - transfer squared @xmath3 .    based on the combined inclusive nc and cc cross sections measured by the h1 and zeus experiments using data taken from 1992 to 2000 in phase1 ( herai ) , a set of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , herapdf1.0 ,",
    "was previously obtained  @xcite .",
    "these data have also been the primary input for all modern pdf sets such as ct10  @xcite , mmht2014  @xcite and nnpdfs  @xcite .    in phase2 ( heraii ) , from 2002 to 2007",
    ", the integrated luminosity of the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) collision amounts to about 150pb@xmath6 ( 235pb@xmath6 ) , representing an increase by a factor of 1.5 ( 15 ) over that of the corresponding number at herai .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 beams were longitudinally polarised at heraii .",
    "however for the derivation of herapdf2.0 , the heraii data were corrected to zero beam polarisation so that a full combination with the unpolarised cross sections from herai could be made .",
    "this writeup is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : combination ] , the data combination is briefly described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdf ] , the qcd analysis to extract pdfs from the combined inclusive data is presented , followed by a summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "full details of the analysis are given in  @xcite .",
    "in total , 41 data sets have been used in the combination , of which 21 are from herai , taken mainly at nominal proton beam energy ( @xmath8 ) of 920gev but also at 820gev , and 12 from heraii are at 920gev and 4 each at 575 and 460gev , corresponding to centre - of - mass energies ( @xmath9 ) of 320 , 300 , 251 and 225gev .",
    "a total number of 2927 individual data points is transformed and combined into a set of 1307 common grid points .",
    "the transformation is performed based on predictions at high @xmath3 using an in - situ nlo qcd fit to the data and at low @xmath3 a fractal model  @xcite based fit .",
    "the combination is made by averaging the transformed data points based on a @xmath10 minimisation method  @xcite , assuming that there is only one correct value for the cross section of each process at each point of the phase space .",
    "the correlation within a data set and between different data sets is taken into account in the combination .",

    "right : the combined cc @xmath5 cross sections from herai in comparison with the full combination.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=54.5% ]    the combination has significantly improved not only the statistical precision but also the systematic one since h1 and zeus used different reconstruction methods . also for certain regions of the phase space , where one of the two experiments has superior precision compared to the other , the less precise measurement is fitted to the more precise measurement , with a simultaneous reduction of the correlated systematic uncertainty .",
    "this reduction propagates to the other points , including those which are based solely on the measurement from the less precise experiment .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : datacomb ] .",
    "the first example presents the reduction of the uncertainty from some of the selected individual nc @xmath4 cross sections to the combined one and the second one the reduction from the combined cc @xmath5 herai data to the full combination .",
    "the first example also shows the strong scaling violation effect in the nc data which gives rise to the sensitivity to constrain the gluon distribution function of the proton .",
    "the data at different @xmath8 and thus @xmath9 allow a direct measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath11 providing further sensitivity to the gluon distributions .",
    "the availability of precision nc and cc cross sections over a large phase space allows herapdf to be based on @xmath12 scattering data only and makes herapdf independent of any nuclear corrections .",

    "[ fig : fit ] ( top right ) in comparison with that from herapdf1.0 .",
    "the new pdfs have substantially better precision in particular at high @xmath2 and the new @xmath34 and @xmath35 valence quarks are slightly harder but both sets are consistent within the uncertainty bands which include the experimental , model and parameterisation uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "given the improved @xmath10/d.o.f . at higher @xmath26 ,",
    "a herapdf2.0 variant with @xmath36 , herapdf2.0hiq2 , is obtained , whose predictions at nnlo are compared with the combined nc @xmath4 data for @xmath3 below 120gev@xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( bottom left ) .",
    "good agreement is observed in the fitted @xmath3 region .",
    "the extrapolation to the low @xmath3 and @xmath2 shows , however , clear deviation between the prediction and the low @xmath37 data , which may indicate that one needs to add further contributions ( e.g.  resummation of @xmath38 terms ) beyond the fixed nnlo order for the low @xmath37 predictions .",
    "the gluon distribution is known to be strongly correlated with the strong coupling constant @xmath39 .",
    "using the inclusive nc and cc cross section data is not able to simultaneously determine both .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( bottom right ) .",
    "this is why the @xmath31 value is fixed for herapdf2.0 to 0.118 at both nlo and nnlo and to 0.130 at lo .",
    "the same figure also shows that by adding jet data ( combined charm data is also included , however its main effect is to constrain the pole mass of the charm quark to be 1.47 ( 1.43)gev in the nlo ( nnlo ) fit ) , a simultaneous fit of @xmath31 and pdfs becomes possible .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 at nlo amounts to @xmath40 , which is competitive in precision with other nlo determinations .",
    "note that the jet data can not be included in an nnlo fit as its prediction in dis has not been calculated to nnlo .",
    "the full combination of the inclusive nc and cc cross sections published previously by h1 and zeus at herai and ii is finally ready .",
    "the combined data , covering six orders of magnitude in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 and reaching an unprecedented precision with typical values of below 0.5% for medium @xmath3 region at the nominal centre - of - mass energy , represent a major legacy of hera .",
    "a new pdf set , herapdf2.0 at lo , nlo and nnlo , is derived with a qcd fit to the combined inclusive data for @xmath3 above 3.5gev@xmath19 .",
    "the new pdfs have smaller experimental uncertainties over that of herapdf1.0 .    by including additional jet and charmed data from hera , a precision determination of @xmath1 at nlo ( excluding the dominant scale uncertainties ) in obtained .",
    "the value is in excellent agreement with the world average value of 0.1185  @xcite .",
