    "similarly , a weak hybridization of the ce4@xmath11 final state , either due to the kondo effect or to the formation of 4@xmath11 metal ligands ( mott  like delocalization ) would result in a shift of the m@xmath103-edge to lower energy .",

    "the first one , g - type commensurate localized antiferromagnetism would give no muon signal and the neutron bragg peak , while the second incommensurate order , with short coherence length would be responsible for the muon signal .",
    "this scenario gives however no explanations why the two orders would have the same amplitude or why the short range magnetic order was not detected by neutron diffraction .",
    "a short range order would give a broader diffraction peak but should still be observed . a more convincing explanation is found by looking at the time scales of the two probes : @xmath128s for the muons , while @xmath129ps for the neutrons . a magnetic order occurring in a band of partial ce4@xmath11 character , such as the one revealed by the xas measurements ,",
    "is expected to have both localized and itinerant structures . on short time",
    "scales , the 4@xmath11 character dominates , with electrons found preferentially at the cerium position and domains with magnetic moment localized on the cerium site will be probed . due to the electronic motion of the ce4@xmath11 electrons ,",
    "the size of these commensurate magnetism domains will shrink at larger time scales , and the incommensurate structure formed by the itinerant charge carriers will be probed .",
    "such incommensurate magnetism is expected to generate a bessel type depolarization function for the @xmath23sr asymmetry signal , as observed experimentally@xcite .",

    "<S> the two band hole sheets are the ones of strong 4@xmath11 angular momentum character believed to play an important role in cecoin@xmath2 , both for superconductivity and antiferromagnetism@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the afm phase potentially leading to the qcp and superconductivity in cecoin@xmath2 is usually understood in term of `` delocalization '' of the ce4@xmath11 electrons . in heavy fermions systems </S>",
    "<S> , at least three different mechanisms can `` delocalize '' the ce4@xmath11 electrons : ( i ) the kondo effect@xcite , ( ii ) an increase in cerium valence@xcite , and ( iii ) the formation / broadening of an electronic band of partial ce4@xmath11 character ( mott delocalization)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each of these effects can independently introduce the ce4@xmath11 electrons into the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> note that ce4@xmath11 electrons belonging to the fermi surface ( referred to as itinerant ) via one of the previous effects can still be `` delocalized '' by the two other mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> a variation of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) coupling is unlikely to be the cause of the suppression of the afm phase as no ferromagnetism was reported under higher pressures@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of a local  itinerant transition takes place between the parent afm system cerhin@xmath2 in which most of the ce4@xmath11 electrons do not participate to the fermi surface and cecoin@xmath2 in which most of the ce4@xmath11 electrons participate to the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> such transition can be observed experimentally via a modification of de - haas - van - alphen frequencies between cecoin@xmath2@xcite and cerhin@xmath2@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to the equivalent lanthanum system , which has no 4@xmath11 electrons , leads to the same conclusion : the volume of the fermi surface is modified upon lanthanum doping in ce@xmath12la@xmath13coin@xmath2 and stays constant in ce@xmath12la@xmath13rhin@xmath2@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the afm transition in this family is however not directly related to the local  itinerant transition . in the intermediate system </S>",
    "<S> cerh@xmath14co@xmath15in@xmath2 a reconstruction of the fermi surface occurs at @xmath16 , associated with partial inclusion of the ce4@xmath11 electrons into the fermi surface for @xmath17 , while antiferromagnetism persists up to @xmath18@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in ceco(in@xmath0cd@xmath1)@xmath2 the variation of the fermi volume with @xmath19 is weak and comparable to the case of laco(in@xmath0cd@xmath1)@xmath2 at least up to @xmath20 which is already an afm system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of antiferromagnetism must therefore be ascribed to a `` delocalization '' of itinerant ce4@xmath11 electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the isostructural @xmath21@xmath10 phase transition of pure cerium shows strong analogies to the afm  </S>",
    "<S> paramagnetic transition of heavy fermion systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large volume change of the unit cell at the @xmath21@xmath10 phase transition is also attributed to one of the `` delocalization '' mechanisms discussed above@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the various proposed models are : ( i ) valence variation of @xmath22 ( promotional model)@xcite , ( ii ) kondo volume collapse model@xcite or ( iii ) formation of a band of partial ce4@xmath11 angular momentum character ( mott transition)@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the question addressed through the experiments of this study is the origin of the suppression of the magnetic order in ceco(in@xmath0cd@xmath1)@xmath2 , that is , identifying the `` delocalization '' mechanism and its relation to superconductivity . in ceco(in@xmath0cd@xmath1)@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the afm phase was probed by muon spin rotation ( @xmath23sr ) and neutron diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23sr technique also established the coexistence of antiferromagnetism with superconductivity , while the valence of cerium was determined by x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) . a comparison to metallic cerium </S>",
    "<S> allows resolving the nature of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these three different experimental probes allows a deep understanding of the ground state of this system that can not be achieved with a single technique . </S>"
