    "in this paper we define new families of equivariant free resolutions .",
    "these extend the equivariant resolutions defined in @xcite over the general linear group , which gave the first proof in characteristic 0 of the existence of the `` pure '' resolutions conjectured by boij and sderberg @xcite .",
    "the proof of acyclicity of the pure resolutions in @xcite was indirect and used the borel ",
    "bott theorem . here",
    "we give a more direct proof based on an explicit description of the differentials due to olver @xcite .",

    "we also provide some evidence for an equivariant form of the boij ",
    "sderberg conjectures that would have striking consequences for schur functions .",
    "let us describe the setup more precisely and give an overview of the paper .",
    "we work over a field @xmath0 of characteristic zero , and let @xmath1 be an @xmath2-dimensional vector space over @xmath0 .",
    "we set @xmath3 $ ] to be a polynomial ring in @xmath2 variables , and we consider the general linear group @xmath4 as an algebraic group over @xmath0 . in this paper , all modules are assumed to be graded .",
    "we consider finitely generated equivariant @xmath5-modules @xmath6 .",
    "this means that one has an ( algebraic ) action of @xmath4 on @xmath6 denoted @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and an action of @xmath5 on @xmath6 denoted @xmath10 for @xmath11 such that the identity @xmath12 holds , where @xmath13 denotes the canonical action of @xmath4 on @xmath14 .",
    "note that since @xmath4 ( and other classical groups used below ) are linearly reductive , the category of @xmath4-representations is semisimple , so every graded equivariant @xmath5-module @xmath6 has a minimal graded equivariant resolution whose terms are direct sums of free modules of type @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the irreducible representation of @xmath4 of highest weight @xmath17 .",
    "the above statements remain true when we replace @xmath4 by @xmath18 or @xmath19 whenever @xmath1 has a nondegenerate orthogonal or symplectic form .",
    "section  [ equivariantressection ] extends the results of @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "pure free resolutions are constructed in characteristic 0 using representation theory .",
    "one of the main constructions was the minimal free resolution of the cokernel of a nonzero map of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are partitions satisfying @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in section  [ purefreesection ] ,",
    "we give a simpler proof of the correctness of the terms of the minimal resolution of @xmath26 .",
    "then in section  [ pieriresolutionsection ] , we extend the construction of minimal free resolutions in theorem  [ r=1 ] by removing the restrictions on @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we only assume that @xmath27 is a subrepresentation of @xmath28 , so that a nonzero equivariant map of the form exists .",
    "we call such maps * pieri maps*. the decomposition of the modules in the resolution in terms of @xmath4 representations can be described purely combinatorially in terms of partitions . we also present a simple combinatorial algorithm for writing down a free resolution of the cokernel of a map of the form @xmath29 in theorem  [ r>1 ] ( under the natural assumption that @xmath30 is a subrepresentation of @xmath28 for @xmath31 ) . in general , the resolution we give may not be minimal , see example  [ nonminimalexample ] .",
    "however , we give an explicit closed form description for the minimal free resolution in corollary  [ singlecolumns ] for the special case when @xmath32 and @xmath21 differ in only one entry for each @xmath33 .",
    "we call the minimal resolutions of maps of the form .",
    "the map @xmath34 ( and hence @xmath35 ) can be calculated ( up to a scalar multiple ) in macaulay 2 using the pierimaps package ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 . representing the module @xmath41 by the young diagram of @xmath17 ( our convention for partitions : the diagram of @xmath17",

    "we remark that the techniques of @xcite are limited to characteristic 0 because of the failure of the borel  weil  bott theorem in positive characteristic , and our techniques are limited to characteristic 0 because semisimplicity of the general linear group fails otherwise , which means that nonzero equivariant maps of the form often do not exist .",
    "also included in section  [ pieriresolutionsection ] is how equivariant resolutions can be constructed when @xmath5 is replaced by the exterior algebra @xmath46 .",
    "the resolutions one obtains are infinite in length , but still simple to describe combinatorially .    in section  [ otherclassicalgroups ]",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite to other classical groups .",

    "the constructions in the case of the general linear group are functorial and hence extend to vector bundles .",
    "we construct the analogues of a family of graded equivariant @xmath49-modules @xmath6 which is analogous to the cokernel of pieri maps in the @xmath4 case by considering pieri resolutions of homogeneous bundles over certain homogeneous spaces for @xmath47 .",

    "they are not pure but can still be considered to be the analogues of the complexes from @xcite .",
    "the lie types @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are treated in separate subsections .",
    "the arguments here are more delicate , since the resolutions are constructed as iterated mapping cones , and for example , in the calculations for type b , one must analyze a connecting homomorphism in a long exact sequence to prove that some repeating representations cancel .    section  [ equivariantbssection ] is concerned with a possible equivariant analogue of the boij ",

    "we define its equivariant betti table @xmath54 as follows : if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 is the character of @xmath57 .",
    "the strong version of the conjecture says that given any finite length equivariant module @xmath6 with equivariant resolution @xmath58 , there exist representations @xmath59 such that @xmath60 has a filtration with associated graded @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the minimal free resolution of the map @xmath63 .",
    "the weak version of the conjecture replaces the isomorphism of complexes in with an equality of equivariant betti tables .",
    "if we remove the adjective `` equivariant , '' then the weak version of the conjecture is a theorem of eisenbud and schreyer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 0.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , their result holds over any field , and the finite length condition can be replaced by an arbitrary codimension .",
    "the weak form of the conjecture would already be interesting from the point of view of cohomology tables of homogeneous bundles on projective space . in @xcite , a bilinear pairing is defined between minimal resolutions over @xmath14 and vector bundles on the projective space @xmath64 which reveals a duality between the two .",
    "this bilinear pairing can also be defined in an equivariant way , and one hopes that a similar kind of duality holds in an equivariant sense .",
    "we present some examples of decompositions predicted by the weak version of the conjecture in section  [ equivariantbssection ] .",
    "we also provide some partial results in this direction ( see proposition  [ simplicialcase ] ) and discuss some of the difficulties in trying to extend the proof of eisenbud and schreyer to the equivariant setting and in trying to find counterexamples to the existence of such decompositions .",
