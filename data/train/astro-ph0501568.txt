    "the 30doradus region in the lmc is the largest and most massive hii region in the local group at a distance of 53  kpc . within a diameter of @xmath0 ( 200  pc ) it contains more than @xmath1 of ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the inner 60  pc contain the stellar cluster ngc2070 with about 2400 ob stars , which are responsible for about 1/3 of the total ionizing radiation of the entire 30doradus region @xcite .",
    "the dense center of ngc2070 is called r136 ( hd38268 ) . with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath2 @xcite in the inner 4.5  pc r136",
    "is often considered the closest example of a starburst region .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the projected distribution of emission line stars in the central part of ngc2070 . for the purpose of this study",
    "their exact spectral classification is rather subordinate ; what is important here , however , is that these stars are very massive o - stars ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the stars labeled in fig .  [ fig1 ] either have been classified as wolf - rayet stars @xcite or x - ray sources , presumable hmxbs @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the projected distance and spectral types for these stars .",
    "about one third of them is located within @xmath3 of r136a , close to another third is spread across the entire region , with distances ranging from @xmath4 .",
    "but more than one third of these massive stars in 30dor appear to be located in a shallow sphere of @xmath5 ( although even more of the massive stars , which we attribute to the core region , may be actually located in the sphere behind or in front of r136a ) .",
    ".emission line stars in and near r136 .",
    "the spectral type is based on determinations by @xcite.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,<,^ \" , ]     could this be just a statistical fluctuation ? for a core radius of @xmath6 @xcite and under the assumption that the stellar density distribution follows roughly a standard cluster king profile , we would expect _",
    "8^13dr = i_0 r_c _",
    "8^13  = 2.2 in the projected sphere , while we find 9 @xmath7 emission line stars  well above a random statistical fluctuation ! thus we conclude that their apparent location must have a physical origin .",
    "generally , massive stars do not form in isolation but in clusters and associations . for",
    "a salpeter imf @xcite one would expect about 65 stars with @xmath8 for each star of @xmath9 .",
    "are the massive stars around r136 surrounded by increased stellar density , relative to the overall cluster density profile , or do they appear to be isolated ?",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the local luminosity functions , derived from wfpc2 data in the v ( f555w ) and i ( f814w ) filter bands @xcite , for 16 randomly chosen test fields and the 9 emission line stars .",
    "there is no noticeable enhancement in stellar density around the peculiar emission line stars that would support the presence of smaller clusters .",
    "however , we note the possibility that smaller associations could have dissolved within only a couple of million years to a level , which is below the detection limit .      sequential star formation has been found to have triggered the lmc associations lh9 and lh10 @xcite as well as n144 and n158 @xcite in the vicinity of the 30doradus nebula .",
    "several sites of ongoing star formation , such as hodge  301 and r143 , are located only 3  arcminutes from r136 . however , the peculiar emission line star are located very close to r136 , in a region of very little extinction where the gas has been mostly cleared out @xcite .",
    "no gaseous filamentary structures , often associated with triggered star formation are present in the inner parts .",
    "most importantly , the emission line stars around r136 are likely of the same age than the stars within r136 .",
    "the core of r136 still appears to be the most recent site of massive star formation within @xmath10 , making a second generation of massive stars in its vicinity rather unlikely .",
    "runaway ob  stars , i.e. , apparent field stars with high relative velocities of @xmath11  km / s have been known for a long time  a prime example are ae  auriga and @xmath12  columba both moving at 100  km / s away from orion @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , relative velocities are difficult to determine for the stars around r136 .",
    "although it would only take them 0.3  myr to reach the observed location from the cluster core , even at a runaway velocity as low as 10  km / s the corresponding proper motion would only be @xmath13 over a 20 year baseline .",
    "radial velocity studies are in progress , but complicated by the energetic winds from these stars .    at any rate ,",
    "some of the emission line stars are o - star binaries , which can not be explained by supernova explosions .",
    "most importantly , with an age of less than 4  myr , r136 is unlikely to have yet produced such a large number of supernovae , and even more so when taking the kinematical age , i.e. , the `` travel time '' from the birthplace to the observed locations , into account .",
    "one can estimate that the timescales for global mass segregation of r136 are about @xmath14  yr @xcite .",
    "however , the relaxation time for the high mass ( @xmath15 ) stars alone is significantly shorter than for the low mass ( @xmath16 ) stars by a factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the velocity dispersions for the low and high mass stars , respectively .",
    "hence , even in the simplified analytic framework , which assumes point - like , identical particles and no binaries , the relaxation time for the high mass stars can easily be @xmath20 orders of magnitude shorter .",
    "recently , portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2004 ) performed n - body simulations of a much more realistic situation : 130,000 stars with a mass distribution given by a salpeter imf , a cluster half - mass radius of 1.2  pc , and an initial binary frequency of @xmath21 companions per primary ob star  about @xmath22",
    "times higher than the frequency of low - mass companions . ] .",
    "the initial conditions used in the simulations are similar to the conditions in r136 .",
    "the high central density , existence of binaries , finite stellar sizes and realistic mass spectrum allow the cluster to undergo sigificant dynamical evolution early on  provided that the core density is sufficiently high .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the cluster core radius for different concentration parameters . in the most extreme case",
    ", core collapse happens at less than 1  myr . at those high stellar densities dynamical processes ( binary - binary , or binary - single star interactions )",
    "can account for numerous ejections of massive stars from r136 .",
    "whether an ejected binary can become a luminous x - ray source depends on its orbital separation . for a total mass of r136 of @xmath23 , a mean stellar mass of @xmath24 , and a half - mass radius of 1.2  pc",
    "a binary of mass @xmath25 and a binding energy @xmath26 will have an orbital separation of @xmath27 , which is a typical separation for an x - ray binary .",
    "although ngc3603 has been referred to a galactic clone of r136 @xcite there are significant differences .",
    "most relevant here is that ngc3603 , with an age of about 1  myr @xcite , is significantly younger than r136 . given the strong dependency on central density and quick evolution ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) a few hundred thousand years can make a big difference .",
    "first , the tidal radius of r136 is about @xmath28 @xcite . _",
    "if _ the stars are still bound to the cluster potential they are in elliptical orbits around r136 and most likely to be found at the apocenter .",
    "second , most of the dynamical interactions , which have led to an ejection of a massive star , have occurred within a narrow time window , namely after the core has reached a critical density .",
    "third , even spherically uniform distributions tend to appear ring - like in projection .",
