    "in an article published in journal of mathematical physics in 1973 i derived and analyzed in detail a model for a gravitating particle that was an improvement on the schwarzschild blackhole model  @xcite .",
    "this static and spherically symmetric space - time manifold , discovered independently at about the same time by k.  a.  bronnikov  @xcite and formally some years earlier by o.  bergmann and r.  leipnik who rejected it for `` physical reasons ''  @xcite , i termed a ` drainhole ' with ` ether ' flowing through it .",
    "the manifold is geodesically complete , singularity - free , and devoid of horizons .",
    "it comprises a topological hole ( the ` drainhole ' ) connecting two spatial regions , an ` upper ' and a ` lower ' , on which there is a space - time vector field ( the ` ether - flow ' vector field ) representing the velocities of test particles free - falling from rest at infinity in the upper region , into and through the hole , and out into the lower region , accelerating downward all the way .",
    "the upper region being asymptotic to a schwarzschild manifold with positive mass parameter @xmath0 , the lower region is asymptotic to a schwarzschild manifold with negative mass parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a parameter that determines the size of the hole .",
    "thus the drainhole attracts test particles on its high side , but repels them on the low side more strongly , in the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "the drainhole can be thought of as a kind of natural accelerator of the ` gravitational ether ' , drawing it in on the high side and expelling it more forcefully on the low side . to avoid ambiguities associated with the term ` ether '",
    "one could say that it is space itself that is flowing into and through the drainhole , a substitution that would accord well with einstein s insight that the concepts of space and of a gravitational ether are essentially interchangeable  @xcite .",
    "in the 1973 paper i wrote that a `` speculative extrapolation from the asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath4 is that the universe expands because it contains more negative mass than positive , each half - particle of positive mass @xmath0 being slightly overbalanced by a half - particle of negative mass @xmath4 such that @xmath5 . ''",
    "this speculation lay dormant until the beginning of 2006 , when it occurred to me that the same mechanism might be used to explain not only the expansion of the universe but also the recently discovered acceleration of that expansion .",
    "to properly exploit that idea i have found it necessary to reject three of the assumptions that have been built into standard relativistic cosmological theory from its earliest days .",
    "the first is einstein s implicit assumption that active gravitational mass and passive - inertial mass are the same thing .",
    "the second , which uncritical acceptance of the first gives rise to , is that if a field thought to be associated with some form of matter couples to geometry in the field equations of space - time with the ` wrong ' polarity ( the ` wrong sign of the coupling constant ' ) , then that form of matter is a ` phantom ' or ` ghost ' form that can exist only in ` exotic ' circumstances .",
    "the third is that every scalar field included in a variational principle of relativistic gravitational theory must represent some form of matter and must therefore have its own separate field equation produced by variation of that field in the action integral of the variational principle .",
    "as i shall show , denial of these three assumptions is logically consistent and allows one to arrive at a purely geometric theory of gravitation that produces a singularity - free cosmological model of the universe that fits with very good precision hubble diagram data from recent observations of type ia supernovae .",
    "this model features a ` big bounce ' ( instead of a ` big bang ' ) , rapid inflation out of the bounce , and a ` graceful exit ' from the inflation into a long period of decelerative coasting , followed by a transition to an ultimately exponential , de sitter - like accelerating expansion .",
    "in addition , attributing the accelerating expansion to the existence of drainholes provides explanations for dark matter , dark ` energy ' , and the formation of cosmic voids , walls , filaments , and nodes .",
    "the model is offered as a replacement for and improvement on the standard @xmath6cdm cosmological model .",
    "albert einstein , in his 1916 paper die grundlage der allgemeinen relativittstheorie  @xcite that gave a thorough presentation of the theory of gravity he had worked out over the preceding decade , made an assumption that does not hold up well under scrutiny . stripped down to its barest form the assumption is that inertial mass , and by extension energy _ via _",
    "@xmath7 , is a source of gravity and must therefore be coupled to the gravitational potential in the field equations of the general theory of relativity .",
    "the train of thought that brought him to this conclusion is described in  16 , where he sought to extend his field equations for the vacuum , @xmath8 as currently formulated , to include the contribution of a continuous distribution of gravitating matter of density  @xmath9 , in analogy to the extension of the laplace equation @xmath10 for the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath11 to the poisson equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "einstein referred to @xmath9 as the `` density of matter '' , without specifying what was meant by ` matter ' or its ` density ' . invoking the special theory s identification of `` inert mass '' with `` energy , which finds its complete mathematical expression in ",
    "the energy - tensor '' , he concluded that `` we must introduce a corresponding energy - tensor of matter @xmath14 '' . further describing this energy - tensor as `` corresponding to the density  @xmath9 in poisson s equation '' ,",
    "he arrived at the extended field equations @xmath15 , in which , for a `` frictionless adiabatic fluid '' of `` density ''  @xmath9 , pressure  @xmath16 ( a form of kinetic energy ) , and proper four - velocity distribution  @xmath17 , he took @xmath18 to be @xmath19 ( @xcite,19 ) .    clearly , einstein s procedure fails to distinguish between the ` active gravitational mass ' of matter , which measures how much gravity it produces and is the sole contributor to the `` density of matter '' in poisson s equation , and the `` inert mass '' of matter , which measures how much it accelerates in response to forces applied to it , an effect entirely different from the production of gravity .",
    "these two conceptually different masses , along with yet a third , all occur in newton s gravitational equation @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is the _ active _ gravitational mass of a gravitating body a , @xmath22 is the _ inertial _ ( `` inert '' ) mass of a body b being acted upon by the gravity of a , and @xmath23 is the _ passive _ gravitational mass of b , a measure of the strength of b s ` sensing ' of the gravitational field around  a. that in suitable units @xmath24 for all bodies is another way of saying that all bodies respond with the same accelerations to the same gravitational fields , that , in consequence , the notion of a ` gravitational force ' is irrelevant , but the notion of a ` gravitational field ' is not .",
    "simple thought experiments of galileo ( large stone and smaller stone tied together )  @xcite and einstein ( body suspended by rope in elevator )  @xcite make it clear that bodies do all respond alike  an observation now treated as a principle , the ( weak ) ` principle of equivalence ' , experimentally , if somewhat redundantly , well confirmed . that this passive - inertial mass has any relation to active gravitational mass is not apparent in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , where , unlike @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath21 represents a property of a , not of b. but newton s equation for the gravitational action of b on a reads @xmath25 application of newton s law of action and reaction allows the inference that @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same magnitude , from which follows that @xmath28 , hence that the ratio of active gravitational mass to passive gravitational mass , thus to inertial mass , is the same for all bodies .",
    "it would seem likely that einstein relied , either consciously or unconsciously , on this consequence of newton s laws when he assumed that `` inert mass '' should contribute to the `` density of matter '' as a source of gravity in the field equations .",
    "newton s law of action and reaction is applicable to the bodies a and b only under the condition that gravity acts at a distance instantaneously , that is , at infinite propagation speed .",
    "but the general theory of relativity that einstein was expounding is a field theory in which gravitational effects propagate at finite speed . within his own theory of gravity",
    "there is , therefore , no obvious justification for einstein s assumption that inertial mass ( and therefore energy ) is equivalent to active gravitational mass .",
    "this , however , is not to say that there is no relation at all between the two kinds of mass .",
    "there is , for example , the seemingly universal coincidence that wherever there is matter made of atoms there are to be found both inertial mass and active gravitational mass .",
    "indeed , the fact that newton s theory is a close first approximation to einstein s would argue for some proportionality between @xmath29 and @xmath23 for such matter in bulk  not , however , for each individual constituent of such matter .",
    "a 1986 analysis of lunar data concluded that the ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath23 for aluminum differs from that for iron by less than @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "an earlier , cavendish balance experiment had put a limit of @xmath31 on the difference of these ratios for bromine and fluorine  @xcite .",
    "but those results are only for matter in bulk , that is , matter made of atoms and molecules .",
    "it is entirely possible that electrons , for example , do not gravitate at all , for no one has ever established by direct observation that they do , nor is it likely that anyone will .",
    "there is in the literature an argument that purports to show that if the ratio @xmath32 is the same for two species of bulk matter , then electrons must be generators of gravity  @xcite , but that argument can be seen on careful examination to rest on an unrecognized , hidden assumption , namely that , in simplest form , the gravitational field of a hydrogen atom at a distance could be distinguished from that of a neutron at the same distance  @xcite  another assumption no one has tested or is likely to test by direct observation .",
    "einstein s assumption that energy and inertial mass are sources of gravity has survived to the present virtually unchallenged .",
    "it has generated a number of consequences that have directed much of the subsequent research in gravitation theory  indeed , misdirected it if his assumption is wrong . among them are the following :    * the impossibility , according to penrose  hawking singularity theorems , of avoiding singularities in the geometry of space - time without invoking ` negative energy ' , which is really just energy coupled to gravity with polarity opposite to that of the coupling of matter to gravity .",
    "* the presumption that the extra , fifth dimension in kaluza  klein theory must be a spatial dimension rather than a dimension of another type . *",
    "the belief that all the extra dimensions in higher - dimensional theories must be spatial , causing the expenditure of much effort in mental gymnastics to explain why they are not apparent to our senses in the way that the familiar three spatial dimensions are .    denying einstein",
    "s assumption relieves one of the burden of these troublesome conclusions and opens the door to other , more realistic ones .",
    "if einstein s assumption is to be disallowed , then his source tensor for a continuous distribution of gravitating matter , @xmath33 , must be modified or replaced .",
    "one might think to simply drop the second term and take @xmath34 , the energy - momentum tensor of the matter . this would be inconsistent , for the @xmath9 in that tensor is the density of inertial - passive mass , which we are now not assuming to be the same as active gravitational mass . what to do instead",
    "?    at the same time that einstein was creating his field equations david hilbert was deriving the field equations for ( in particular ) empty space from the variational principle @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this is the most straightforward extension to the general relativity setting of the variational principle @xmath36 , whose euler  lagrange equation is equivalent to the laplace equation @xmath10 for the newtonian potential @xmath11 . modifying that principle to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the density of the _ active _ gravitational mass of matter , generates the poisson equation @xmath39 .",
    "the most straightforward extension of this modified principle to general relativity is @xmath40 for which the euler ",
    "lagrange equations are equivalent to @xmath41 which makes @xmath42 .",
    "equivalent to this equation is @xmath43 , the 00 component of which reduces in the slowly varying , weak field approximation to the poisson equation , with @xmath44 .",
    "the vanishing of the divergence of the einstein tensor field on the lefthand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) entails that @xmath45 , hence that @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "this would seem to be a comedown from the equations of motion of the matter distribution implied by the vanishing of the divergence of einstein s @xmath18 , but those equations are unrealistic in that they have the density @xmath9 of inertial mass playing a role that would properly belong to the density @xmath38 of active mass in any such equations derived from _ gravitational _ field equations .",
    "as will be seen , the new , improved field equations to be arrived at will allow @xmath38 to vary .    to widen the range of space - time geometries admitted by the field equations one can in the usual way add to the action integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) terms related to such things as scalar fields and electromagnetic fields .",
    "in particular , one can add a cosmological constant term , changing the integrand to @xmath46 and the field equations to @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "a positive cosmological constant @xmath6 thus appears in this context to be a ( mis)representation of a negative active mass density @xmath49 of a continuous distribution of gravitationally repulsive matter .",
    "as suggested in the introduction , an excess of this negative density over the positive active mass density @xmath38 of attractive matter could drive an accelerating cosmic expansion ( and in the process would solve the vexing ` cosmological constant problem ' by doing away with the cosmological constant ) . leaving for later a full discussion of drainholes as the source of such a density imbalance ( cf .",
    "vi.a ) , let us explore the consequences of presuming one exists , by studying cosmological solutions of field equations that incorporate a positive mass density @xmath38 , a negative mass density @xmath49 , and scalar fields @xmath11 ( not the newtonian @xmath11 ) and @xmath50 , all coupled to the space - time geometry _ via _ the variational principle @xmath51 \\",
    ", |g|^{\\frac12 } d^4\\!x = 0 \\ , . \\label{eqn6}\\ ] ]    in deriving field equations from this variational principle i will vary only the space - time metric . not varying the densities is normal , but not varying the scalar fields goes against orthodox practice .",
    "the rationale for leaving them unvaried is this : in a space - time manifold the geometry is determined by the metric alone , so only the metric should participate in the extremizing of the action . to vary the scalar fields would be to treat them as something extraneous to the metric thus to the geometry , whereas their proper role should be simply to introduce a useful flexibility into the extremizing process , _ not _ to represent explicit contributions to gravity by the ` energy ' fields of distributions of scalar matter .",
    "varying neither the scalar fields nor the densities , but only the metric , is in keeping with einstein s guiding principle that geometry can explain all of physics",
    ".    looked at another way , including the terms @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in the action can be seen as allowing ` relaxations ' of the metric , analogously to accommodating ` constraints ' on the metric by including lagrange multipliers in the action ( e.  g. , @xmath6  in the action of the @xmath6cdm model , to accommodate the constraint that the volume @xmath56 of the integration region is held fixed ) .",
    "just as one does not vary lagrange multipliers , one should not vary @xmath38 , @xmath49 , @xmath11 , or @xmath50 . in this role @xmath38 , @xmath49 , @xmath11 , and @xmath50 simply relax the field equations to allow a larger class of metrics to satisfy them .",
    "the relaxed field equations will be as useful as the metrics that satisfy them , no more , no less .",
    "breaking the scalar field portion of the action into two parts , one ( @xmath57 ) coupled to geometry with the orthodox polarity , the other ( @xmath54 ) coupled with the opposite ( ` phantom ' or ` ghost ' ) polarity is justified by the absence of any compelling reason for choosing one coupling over the other .",
    "the usual mantra accompanying the making of such a choice is that a scalar field coupled to geometry with the ` wrong sign ' has ` negative energy ' and therefore represents ` exotic matter ' that can exist if at all only in highly contrived circumstances .",
    "this superstition traces back to einstein s mistaking as active the passive - inertial density @xmath9 in his `` energy - tensor of matter @xmath14 '' .",
    "if his field equations @xmath15 were changed to @xmath58 , the effect , in the absence of pressure , would be equivalent to taking the density @xmath9 to be negative in the original equations , in which case the matter it purports to represent would be gravitationally repulsive , and ` exotic ' for having negative inertial mass and therefore negative energy . correcting this mistake",
    "reveals the constructions ` exotic matter with negative energy density ' , ` phantom field ' , ` ghost field ' , and others like them to be little more than instances of misleading jargon .",

    "( [ eqn6 ] ) generates the field equations @xmath59 and @xmath60 the latter of these , which is a derivation from the former , corresponding to the identity @xmath61 , is what one has in place of the wave equations @xmath62 and @xmath63 that would have resulted from varying @xmath11 and @xmath50 .",
