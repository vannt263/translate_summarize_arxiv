    "the enthusiasm in the analysis of @xmath0 interaction amplitudes has been increased significantly quite recently .",
    "especially important were numerous works on dispersive analyzes of experimental data made by bern  @xcite and madrid - krakw  @xcite group .",
    "the significant progress was made when the analyzes began to effectively use theoretical constrains i.e. crossing symmetry condition imposed on the amplitudes found in experimental analyzes .",
    "this was particularly important because of big differences between results obtained by various experimental groups and even between data sets found in the same experimental analysis  @xcite .",
    "those dispersive analyzes had immediately large impact on the spectroscopy of light scalar mesons ( i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) which is evident comparing the tables of the particle data group from the years 2010 and 2012 @xcite .",
    "the analyzes provided also a set of all important amplitudes ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) well describing experimental data up to 1420  mev and 2000  mev in case of works done by the madrid - krakw and bern group , respectively . in both",
    "those analyzes the @xmath1 and @xmath2 wave amplitudes were fitted also to dispersion relations with imposed crossing symmetry constrain below 1100  mev .",
    "the bern group was using roy equations @xcite which need two subtractions and found analytical solution below 800  mev .",
    "the madrid - krakw group also used roy equations and additionally roy like ones , so called gkpy equations with only one subtraction what gave more precise output amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes of higher partial - waves , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , were also fitted to such dispersion relations but only indirectly by means of the roy or gkpy equations , i.e. they were present in the kernel part of the equations written for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves .",
    "an example of practical application of the gkpy equations is our last reanalysis of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave multi - channel amplitudes  @xcite constructed in a previous analysis by fitting the experimental data only  @xcite .",
    "one of the most spectacular effects given by the gkpy equations was a shift of the @xmath5 pole by several hundred mev towards the position indicated by the analyzes of the bern and madrid - krakw group .",
    "it is important to note that this reanalysis was done keeping the original mathematical structure of the amplitudes proposed in the work  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform similar but more extensive reanalysis of the multi - channel @xmath0 amplitudes including the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 partial waves important in the low energy region ( below 2  gev ) .",
    "the initial amplitudes , in the following denoted as original , were fitted only to the experimental data and are taken from our previous analysis ( @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite , hereafter we will use notation @xmath9 if needed ( @xmath10-meson - meson partial wave and @xmath11-isospin ) ) or are updated in this work utilizing a form from  @xcite ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . to perform this analysis we use the gkpy equations for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves constructed and presented in @xcite , which have not been used so far in the analysis of amplitudes .",
    "the final amplitudes are constrained by both the experimental data and the gkpy dispersion relations ( i.e. by crossing symmetry ) .",
    "as the reanalysis is not too much effective for higher partial - waves , particularly for @xmath13 , parameters of this amplitude are expected to be only weakly changed . in the analysis , only some parameters of the amplitudes are changed which do not alter the mathematical structure of the original amplitudes , similarly as in our previous analysis of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves @xcite .",
    "the reanalyzed partial - wave multi - channel amplitudes , constrained also by the crossing symmetry , can be utilized in accounting for the final - state interactions in the decays of heavy mesons and in photoproduction processes , for example , in the clas12 and gluex experiments at jlab .",
    "the amplitudes can also be used in constructing a full @xmath0 amplitude giving the cross section at low energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly remind the method and results of our previous analysis of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 partial - wave amplitudes done in  @xcite . in section iii we present new @xmath12 and @xmath13 amplitudes fitted to experimental data . in section",
    "iv we detail the method and give results of the dispersive analysis for all considered partial - waves .",
    "section v is devoted to discussion of obtained results .",
    "here we also show results for the low - energy total and differential cross sections in the @xmath14 scattering .",
    "summary of results is in section vi .",
    "in our previous work  @xcite we reanalyzed the @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave amplitudes constructed in  @xcite refitting some of their parameters simultaneously to experimental data and to gkpy dispersion relations .",
    "these multi - channel amplitudes are unitary and analytic on the riemann surface with free parameters that are just positions of poles on different riemann sheets and few background parameters .",
    "such simple and not biased mathematical structure makes interpretation of obtained results very easy and unambiguous . in analysis",
    "@xcite these amplitudes were , however , fitted only to very dispersed experimental data from various experiments what resulted in pole positions sometimes very different from those obtained in other analyzes and from those in particle data group tables .    in the analysis @xcite the original mathematical structure of the resonant and background parts of amplitudes from @xcite",
    "was not changed .",
    "the only novelty was a new parameterization of the near threshold amplitudes , which was necessary due to the total lack of description of the phase shifts in this region  @xcite .",
    "polynomials were , therefore , added to both @xmath1 and @xmath2 amplitudes and the phase shifts ( values and the first derivatives ) were smoothly matched below the @xmath15 threshold , at about 400 and 600  mev for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite we also constructed a `` new '' @xmath1-wave isoscalar amplitude hereafter called new @xmath1-wave fitting its parameters only to the data , what improved behavior of the amplitude .",
    "in the subsequent analysis both `` old ''  @xcite and new @xmath1-wave isoscalar amplitudes were used .    in analysis",
    "@xcite the strategy of our work was following : the old ( new ) @xmath1-wave isoscalar and the old isovector @xmath2-wave  @xcite amplitudes , both supplemented with the near threshold polynomials , were used as the input in the gkpy equations that have a general form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the input and output amplitudes , respectively , in a given partial - wave @xmath19 with isospin @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 is the crossing matrix constant and @xmath22 are kernels constructed for partial - wave projected amplitudes with the imposed @xmath23 crossing symmetry condition .",
    "the kernels for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves were presented in @xcite .    as it is seen in eq .",
    "( [ eqgkpy ] ) , one has to use the imaginary parts of all important partial - wave amplitudes as an input .",
    "we took , therefore , these important amplitudes , @xmath24 , @xmath12 , @xmath25 and @xmath13 , directly from ref .  @xcite and",
    "kept them fixed during the analysis .",
    "finally we fitted some parameters of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 amplitudes simultaneously to the experimental data and to the dispersion relations ( [ eqgkpy ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath5 pole moved by several hundred mev to a new position close to that found in dispersive analyzes @xcite .",
    "the minimized full @xmath26 function was composed of two data terms @xmath27 , related with data in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves , and of three terms @xmath28 for the output amplitudes from the dispersion relations @xmath29 where @xmath30 itemizes , respectively @xmath9 partial - waves : the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath24 .",
    "corresponding @xmath27 and @xmath28 were expressed by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ^ 2}{\\left[\\delta { \\rm re}\\ : t_{\\ell}^{i^{(out)}}(s_i)\\right]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) are experimental and our - theoretical phase shifts ( or inelasticities ) and @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) are numbers of the data points for phase shifts ( or inelasticities ) of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 partial - waves in considered coupled channels .",
    "symbol @xmath39 is a number of energy points between the @xmath0 threshold and 1100  mev , at which we calculated @xmath28 ( for all three waves @xmath40 was chosen ) and @xmath41 are fixed to 0.01 in order to make the @xmath28 comparable with the @xmath27 .",
    "let us here notice that terms @xmath28 are in fact not @xmath26 functions but rather squared weighted differences between the input and output amplitudes . for simplicity we keep , however , the name @xmath26 for these terms .",
    "the experimental data for the @xmath0 scattering in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 waves were analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite to study the @xmath42 and @xmath43 mesons . in presented here analysis the s - matrix formalism for n coupled channels was utilized similarly as in our previous dispersive analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves  @xcite . due to the large number of opened channels in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves",
    "the uniformizing variable ( see eq . ( 1 ) in @xcite ) could not be used and therefore , the jost matrix determinant was constructed using the multi - channel breit - wigner forms .    in the present analysis we have used the same formalism for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 waves as in refs .",
    "@xcite and updated the list of contributing resonance states for the @xmath12 wave according to the latest issue of pdg  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding free parameters were fitted to experimental data . in the case of @xmath13 wave",
    "we have found that enough is only one resonance state @xmath44 and have constructed a reasonable description also in the threshold region .",
    "these updated @xmath12 and @xmath13 amplitudes were then used in the analysis with the gkpy equations taken from @xcite ( see [ secresdf ] ) . in the following subsections",

    "these expressions together with the formulas of analytical continuation of the matrix elements to the unphysical sheets naturally generate the resonance poles and zeros on the riemann surface .",
    "the jost determinant is considered in a separable form @xmath50 .",

    "the background part @xmath61 , which represents mainly an influence of neglected channels and resonances , adds in general an energy dependent phase in each channel .      in the analysis of the data in the tensor - isoscalar sector",
    "we have considered explicitly the channels : 1- @xmath0 , 2- effective @xmath62 , 3- @xmath63 , and 4- @xmath64 .",
    "the resonant part of the jost determinant , @xmath65 , is then given by the four - channel breit - wigner form ( [ jostdet_res ] ) with @xmath66 and the barrier factor @xmath67 where the radii @xmath68 have a common value 0.943 fm @xcite which was kept constant in our analysis .",
    "in the set of resonance states contributing to the process we have considered eleven states presented in the pdg summary table  @xcite : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . we have not included the broad state @xmath80 which was not listed in the previous issue of pdg and which can be mimic by the nearby state @xmath71 .",
    "the masses of the resonances were taken from the pdg tables but in the curse of fitting @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath76 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 resonance masses were allowed to change slightly within an interval of several standard deviations around the central value .",
    "the partial widths of the resonances , the parameters @xmath58 in ( [ jostdet_res ] ) , were fitted to the data .",
