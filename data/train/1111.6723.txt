    "such understanding requires using models describing the dynamic response of such structures to self - consistent electromagnetic fields , that also appropriately take into account the relevant quantum effects arising from quantum nature of free charge carriers in such structures and , in general , from their ( quantum ) interaction with each other and with the underlying ion lattice .",

    "it is well known that in a maxwellian plasma the collisionless ( landau ) damping of surface plasma waves is not exponentially small and significantly exceeds that of the volume plasma waves in unbounded plasma , even at small value of @xmath18 when their phase velocity greatly exceeds the electron thermal velocity  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) , the surface wave field is essentially a result of plasma response to a collection of `` virtual '' plasma waves [ i.e. , having frequency @xmath65 and wave vector @xmath129 , but not having a dispersion relation @xmath130 , unlike the `` real '' plasma waves with dispersion relation @xmath130 following from @xmath131 , with the same frequency @xmath132 but with different wave vectors @xmath133 with absolute values @xmath134 ranging from @xmath118 ( for @xmath135 ) to @xmath136 ( for @xmath137 ) .",

    ", the difference in damping of surface and the `` real '' volume plasma waves is even more striking .",
    "indeed , the `` real '' volume waves in such plasma , defined by the dispersion relation @xmath142 with @xmath80 given by eq .",

    "the `` virtual '' plasma waves are , however , still subject to landau damping by plasma electrons if their phase velocity is less than the electron fermi velocity , @xmath145 , i.e. , if their @xmath146 is large enough , @xmath147 ; such virtual waves always give a contribution to the surface wave field , as @xmath146 in ( [ eq : zeta ] ) attains arbitrarily large values .",
    "this also results in the finite , albeit small ( yet infinitely large compared to the zero damping of the `` real '' volume plasma waves ) landau damping of surface waves in degenerate plasma .",
    "the collisionless mean - field approximation used here is justified for a system of weakly interacting particles , when two - particle correlations ( and higher - order particle correlations as well ) can be ignored .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a system in which the collective effects dominate over the effects of particle collisions , which happens when the plasma coupling parameter @xmath148 is small ( see sec .  [",

    "we note that for degenerate electron plasma , the coupling parameter @xmath153 scales as @xmath154 and thus decreases as the plasma density @xmath21 increases ; hence the condition ( [ eq : kappa<<1 ] ) is satisifed for sufficiently dense plasma , with @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the effective electron mass in such plasma .",
    "however , as @xmath21 increases , the electron fermi velocity increases as @xmath157 and may become comparable to the speed of light @xmath158 , in which case the relativistic effects may become important ; to avoid this , we also require that @xmath159 .",
    "thus the nonrelativistic mean - field quasi - classical approximation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) is valid for quantum plasmas with degenerate electrons with densities @xmath160 the condition ( [ eq : joint_condition ] ) may be satisfied for some semiconductors , as pointed out in ref .",

    "the condition ( [ eq : kappa<<1 ] ) ( as well as the first part of the condition ( [ eq : joint_condition ] ) ) is not satisfied ( in fact in metals @xmath161 ) , which suggests that in metals the collisionless mean - field approximation ( as well as the qft model used in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is derived from the mean - field kinetic model  @xcite ) is formally not justified , as the two- and higher - order particle correlations ( due to their coulomb and exchange interactions ) become important .",
    "instead , a kinetic model of moderately coupled plasma , accounting for particle correlations and quantum recoil , should be developed  a difficult task , given the lack of a small parameter characterizing the electron interactions in metals . nevertheless , there are reasons , discussed below , to believe that our idealized model can still work well ( at least qualitatively ) in metals , despite being formally unjustified there .    in the experimental work of watanabe  @xcite ,",
    "the relation between energy loss and scattering angle of 25 kev electrons passing through thin metallic films was measured , and it was found , in particular , that the value of energy loss increases with the scattering angle of electrons . an empirical formula representing this relation for be , mg , and al films was found to be in _ good agreement _ with the corresponding theoretical formula that follows from the dispersion relation of electron plasma waves ( excited by the energetic electrons traversing the metallic film ) , derived using the mean - field kinetic model of free electrons in metal , despite this model being formally unjustified in metals due to violation of ( [ eq : kappa<<1 ] ) there . moreover ,",
    "the effect of quantum recoil , although detectable , is small compared to the effect of fermi - dirac statistics in the whole range of measured scattering angles , especially at small scattering angles ( corresponding to small values of plasma wave number ) .",

    "there is some theoretical evidence of this as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of electron correlations due to their exchange interaction was taken into account under the assumption of characteristic plasma perturbation wavelengths being large compared to the correlation length , using the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "in particular , it was found that the exchange correlations affect the spectrum of volume plasma waves by modifying their dispersion relation ( in the limit of small @xmath129 ) , which becomes : @xmath163 where the third term on the right is due to the exchange correlations , while the second term is due to the quantum statistics resulting in the fermi - dirac distribution ( [ eq : f0 ] ) of electron velocities in degenerate plasma .",
    "we see from ( [ eq : spectrum_exchange ] ) that the term due to exchange correlations is small compared to the term due to quantum statistics even for @xmath162 .",

    "@xcite that in plasmas with low electron temperatures , @xmath49 ( e.g. , for metals at room temperature ) , the effect of electron - electron coulomb collisions is negligible .",
