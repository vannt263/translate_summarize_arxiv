    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the long - standing theoretical possibility that supermassive stars ( smss ) , with masses of @xmath9@xmath10m@xmath1 inhabited the early universe ( see e.g. , volonteri 2012 ) and their possible fates ( e.g. , iben 1963 ; fowler & hoyle 1964 ; appenzeller & fricke 1972 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1979 ; bond et al .  1984 ; fuller et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations for their study comes from observations of quasars at @xmath11 @xmath12@xmath13 which are inferred to be powered by black holes ( bhs ) with masses exceeding @xmath14m@xmath1 ( e.g. , willott et al .  2003 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 ; mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ) . given the short time ( @xmath15myr ) available for such massive bhs to grow via accretion from their initial seed masses , as derived from the most recent cosmological parameters inferred by e.g. , the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( komatsu et al .  2011 ) , and the suppression of bh growth due to the strong radiative feedback from both stars ( e.g. , whalen et al .  2004 ; wise & abel 2007 ; oshea & norman 2008 ) and the bhs themselves ( e.g. , pelupessy et al .  2007 ; alvarez et al .  2009 ; milosavljevi ' c et al .",
    "2009 ; jeon et al .",
    "2012 ; park & ricotti 2012 ) , it now appears more likely than ever that the seeds of the most massive early bhs must have been quite massive themselves ( e.g. , @xmath16m@xmath1 ; see johnson et al .",
    "2012a ; also e.g. , shapiro 2005 ; volonteri & rees 2006 ; natarajan & volonteri 2012 ) .",
    "whereas the majority of the first , population ( pop ) iii stars may have had masses of @xmath17@xmath18m@xmath1 ( e.g. , abel et al .  2002 ; bromm & larson 2004 ; yoshida et al .  2008 ; greif et al .",
    "2011 ) , the best candidates for the seeds of smbhs are thus much more massive ( and rare ) supermassive primordial stars .    an additional , and independent , reason to consider smss in the early universe is that the conditions required for their formation are now thought to be realized much more often than was previously assumed .",
    "the most widely discussed avenue for the formation of smss is via the direct gravitational collapse of hot ( @xmath19k ) primordial gas in so - called atomic cooling dark matter ( dm ) halos at @xmath20 ( e.g. , bromm & loeb 2003 ; begelman et al .",

    ", the gas in the protogalaxy remains at the virial temperature of @xmath21 @xmath22k because h@xmath23 molecules have been photodissociated by the lyman - werner ( lw ) background , leading to the rapid formation of smss via the accretion of gas at rates @xmath24@xmath25 times higher than in the formation of most pop  iii stars from h@xmath26-cooled gas .",
    "the flux of radiation required to keep the gas h@xmath23-free depends on its spectrum , with lower fluxes required if it is produced by metal - enriched stars instead of pop  iii stars ( e.g. , shang et al .  2010 ) .",
    "recent work by independent groups has shown that pop  ii star - forming galaxies in the early universe are able to produce sufficient h@xmath23-dissociating radiation to prevent the cooling of primordial gas in a substantial fraction of atomic cooling halos , thereby leading to the seeding of these halos with smss that can collapse into bhs ( see dijkstra et al .",

    "indeed , agarwal et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) find that a large fraction of the smbhs in the centers of galaxies today may have been seeded by smss .",
    "strengthening these conclusions are other recent results which suggest that lower lw fluxes may be required for the formation of smss , due to a reduced role of h@xmath23 self - shielding ( wolcott - green et al .  2011 ) and the presence of significant turbulence or magnetic fields ( van borm & spaans 2013 ) .",

    "( 2012 ) have shown that they emit little high energy radiation that could halt their continued accretion , and inayoshi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have shown that pulsational instabilities are likewise unable to halt their growth .",
    "johnson et al .  ( 2012b ) modeled the growth of smss to much higher masses and showed that , even if they are able to emit the copious ionizing radiation characteristic of main sequence pop  iii stars , which may occur once the accretion rate becomes sufficiently low ( schleicher et al .",

    "2011 ) , the masses of primordial smss are only limited by the @xmath31myr that they have to accrete gas before they collapse to bhs ( begelman 2010 ) .    whereas the majority of smss are expected to collapse to black holes with little or no associated explosion ( e.g. , fryer & heger 2011 ; see also fuller & shi 1998 ; linke et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is possible that some fraction instead explode as extremely energetic supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , fuller et al .",

    ", we present our results on the energetics and dynamics of the explosion , as well as on metal enrichment and second - generation star formation . in section  4 ,",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of our results .",
    "here we describe the two simulations that we have carried out .",
    "the first is a 1-d radiation hydrodynamics calculation using the los alamos national laboratory rage code ( gittings et al .",
    "2008 ) which allows to track the propagation of the sn blast wave out to several parsecs from the explosion site , deep within the host atomic cooling halo .",
    "for the second , we map the results of the first into a 3-d cosmological simulation using the gadget hydrodynamics code ( springel et al .  2001 ;",
    "springel & hernquist 2002 ) .",
    "our use of these two simulation codes for the phases of the sn in which they are most well - suited to accurately model the explosion , from small ( au ) scales to large ( kpc ) scales , constitutes a significant improvement over previous cosmological simulations of sn feedback .",
    "= 7.in    = 8.5 cm      for the sms progenitor of the sn we adopt the @xmath34m@xmath1 stellar model described in whalen et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , which was evolved until the onset of explosion , using the _ kepler _ code ( weaver et al .",
    "1978 ; woosley et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the explosion was then followed using _ kepler _ and was confirmed ( chen et al . , 2013 ) using the castro code ( almgren et al .",
    "the explosion completely disrupts the star and yields an explosion energy of 7.7 @xmath35 10@xmath36 erg ( heger et al .",
    "the rage code is then used to simulate the sn from the breakout of the shock from the surface of the star until the blast wave has propagated through a circumstellar medium with a density @xmath37@xmath38 ( and a density profile @xmath39 @xmath40 ) out to several parsecs from the explosion site . up to this point , the stellar evolution calculation and the simulation of the early phases of the sn are the same as described in whalen et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , to which",
    "we refer the reader for more detailed discussion of the calclulations ( see also frey et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the blue curves in figure 1 show the velocity ( left panel ) and density ( right panel ) profiles of the sn ejecta at the end of the rage simulation , at which point the shock has propagated out to @xmath41pc from the explosion site .",
    "the @xmath34m@xmath1 of ejecta , @xmath42m@xmath1 of which is heavy elements produced during the evolution and explosion of the progenitor , are traveling at almost @xmath43km@xmath44s@xmath30 outward from the center of the host atomic cooling halo .",
    "it is from this point that we map these velocity and density profiles into a self - consistently evolved atomic cooling halo in a much larger cosmological volume .      to simulate the subsequent evolution of the sn blast wave in the appropriate cosmological environment , we map the velocity and density profiles obtained from the smaller - scale rage simulation into the center of a @xmath45m@xmath1 atomic cooling dm halo , the type of which is expected to host the formation of smss in the early universe .",
    "the halo is identified in a @xmath46mpc@xmath47 ( comoving ) cosmological volume which has been evolved from @xmath48 down to @xmath49 under the influence of a uniform , elevated h@xmath26-dissociating ( lyman - werner ; lw ) radiation field , which prevents the gas from cooling and is assumed to lead to formation of a single sms .",
    "further details of the cosmological simulation up to this point are described in johnson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who considered the impact of the alternative end state of such a sms , a rapidly accreting bh .    to map",
    "the output of the ( eulerian ) rage simulation into the ( lagrangian ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) gadget simulation , we assigned the central @xmath50 sph particles , constituting the @xmath34m@xmath1 of gas within @xmath51pc of the densest particle in the halo , outward ( radial ) velocities and hydrogen number densities so as to match those from the rage simulation .",
    "the fits that we obtain are shown in fig .  1 , with the inner @xmath34m@xmath1 in sph particles constituting the ejecta denoted by orange triangles and the unpertured particles residing in the outskirts of the halo denoted by black circles . whereas we fit the velocity profile very well , due to the mapping from an eulerian to lagrangian code the density profile is somewhat noisier .",
    "nonetheless , the basic features of the density profile containing the vast majority of the mass are represented , and the overall energy and momentum are also well - matched . from the initial conditions shown in fig .",
    "1 we restart the cosmological sph simulation , the results of which we present in the next section .",
    "beyond mapping into it the blast profile of the sms sn , we have chosen to leave the gas in the host halo otherwise unchanged .",
    "we have made this simplifying choice , in light of the large uncertainties in the radiative output of rapidly accreting smss , due to which it is unclear how the radiation emitted during the brief ( @xmath52myr ) lifetime of the star will impact the medium within the host halo . even if the star emits copious ionizing radiation , as main sequence pop  iii stars are expected to do",
    ", it may be that the h  ii region created by the star is confined to the innermost regions of the halo ( johnson et al .",
    "2012 ; see also hosokawa et al .",
    "2012 on the possibility of even less energetic radiation being emitted during the protostellar phase ) .",
    "it is possible , on the other hand , that ionizing radiation is able to escape out into the halo , if the accretion flow is highly anisotropic ( e.g. , due to the presence of an accretion disk ; e.g. , mckee & tan 2008 ) , or if accretion is intermittent ( e.g. , clark et al .",
    "2011 ; smith et al .  2011 ; vorobyov et al .",
    "2013 ) , in which case radiation could break out during periods of reduced accretion .",
    "whereas the small - scale structure of the interstellar gas in the simulation we present here is subject to the limited resolution of the cosmological simulation into which we place the expanding blast wave , we note that at sub - resolution scales ( @xmath53pc ) it is possible that a substantial amount of energy in the explosion is radiated away ( e.g. , kitayama & yoshida 2005 ; whalen et al .",
    "2008 ; de souza et al . 2011 ; vasiliev et al .",
    ". we shall address how such additional radiative losses would affect the dynamics of the blast wave and the metal enrichment of the host halo and igm in future work .",
    "here we present the results of our cosmological hydrodynamics simulation , with particular attention paid to the dynamics of the expanding blast wave and to the enrichment of the igm by the metal - rich sn ejecta .",
    "the injection of almost @xmath54",
    "erg at a single explosion site has a dramatic impact on the host halo .",
    "figure  2 shows the properties of the gas in the vicinity of the halo , as a function of the distance from the explosion site at its center .",
    "as the left - most panels show , the blast results in the complete evacuation of high - density ( @xmath55 @xmath56@xmath38 ) gas within @xmath57myr , with the material overtaken by the shock being carried out beyond the virial radius of the halo ( at @xmath58pc ) at up to @xmath27km@xmath44s@xmath30 .",
    "this material is also shock heated to temperatures up to @xmath59k , resulting in its almost complete ionization , as shown in the right - panels .",
    "the gas , however , rapidly cools due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons , h and he atomic line emission , and bremsstrahlung , as also found ( using the same gadget code ) in the less - energetic ( @xmath60erg ) pair instability supernova ( psn ) explosion in a @xmath61m@xmath62 dm halo simulated by greif et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , as well as in the 1-d calculation of a very energetic ( @xmath63erg ) pop iii sn in a slightly less massive ( @xmath64m@xmath1 ) dm halo presented in kitayama & yoshida ( 2005 ) .    as shown in figure  3 ,",
    "most ( @xmath65 ) of the @xmath66erg initially in the blast is radiated away via these processes within @xmath22yr .",
    "nevertheless , the momentum of the blast is conserved and the shock continues to propagate into the igm , sweeping up the majority of the mass after @xmath67myr . by @xmath68myr , at which time @xmath69 of the energy has been radiated away , the shock has propagated out to @xmath70@xmath57kpc and has swept up almost @xmath71m@xmath1 .    figure  4 shows the properties of the gas in the vicinity of the explosion site within a @xmath72pc ( comoving ) slice of the cosmological volume , at @xmath73myr , @xmath74myr and @xmath75myr after the explosion of the sms . comparing the radial velocity field ( second column from the left ) to the cosmological density field ( far left column ) ,",
    "it is clear that the blast wave propagates most rapidly into the low - density voids while its progress is halted in the direction of the high - density filaments , at the intersection of which lies the host halo .",
    "figs .  2 and 4",
    "also show the same general trend that , at late times , the most strongly shock - heated and highest - velocity material is located behind the shock front several kpc from the explosion site .",
    "the cooler material within the ( @xmath67kpc ) virial radius of the host halo is able to begin recollapsing after @xmath75myr . as we discuss next , this gas is likely to form second - generation stars that are enriched to fairly high metallicities .",
    "= 8.7 cm    = 8.6 cm    = 7.1 in      as is also expected for less energetic psne from pop  iii stars with masses of @xmath76m@xmath1 ( e.g. , heger et al .",
    "2003 ) , a large fraction of the ejecta from our sms sn consists of heavy elements .",
    "in particular , @xmath77m@xmath1 of newly - synthesized metals are ejected in the explosion .",
    "these heavy elements are mixed with the primordial gas , enriching it to relatively high metallicity .",
    "figure  5 shows the average metallicity to which the gas in the vicinity of the explosion site is enriched by the ejecta , after @xmath78myr , @xmath74myr and @xmath79myr .",
    "as the blast wave propagates outward into the low - density igm gas at greater and greater radii becomes enriched .",
    "as metals are carried out of the host halo , metallicities at the smallest radii fall .",
    "after @xmath79myr , however , the average metallicity of the gas out to almost @xmath74kpc ( physical ) is enriched to of the order of @xmath80z@xmath1 , and the densest gas which is recollapsing into the host halo is enriched to @xmath81z@xmath1 . as shown in figure  6 , by @xmath79myr the gas at the center of the sn remnant , shown in figure  7 , has recollapsed to densities of @xmath82@xmath38 , significantly more dense than the highest - density ( @xmath55 @xmath8310@xmath44@xmath38 ) gas that remained within the virial radius of the host halo @xmath84myr after the sn .",
    "not only is the gas recollapsing after @xmath79myr , but , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "6 , a portion of the sn ejecta is entrained in this gas .",
    "if this ejecta is well - mixed with the dense primordial gas , then we expect its metallicity to be @xmath85z@xmath1 , as indicated in fig .  5 .",
    "gas enriched to such a high metallicity is predicted to readily fragment into low - mass stars ( e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; santoro & shull 2006 ; schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) , even in the presence of the elevated lw background radiation field expected in regions of the universe where smss form ( e.g. , omukai et al .",
    "therefore , we expect that second - generation stars would form from this sms sn - enriched gas , and that a large fraction of these would have masses low enough ( @xmath86m@xmath1 ) that they could still be present in the galaxy today . while the nucleosynthetic signature of very massive pop iii pair - instability sne ( i.e. , @xmath87@xmath88m@xmath1 ) has yet to be uncovered in extremely metal - poor stars ( cayrel et al .",
    "2004 ; beers & christlieb 2005 ; frebel et al 2005 ; lai et al 2008 ; joggerst et al 2010 ; joggerst & whalen 2011 ) , it may have been found in high - redshift damped lyman alpha absorbers ( cooke et al .",
    "2011 ) , and a number of metal - poor stars in a recent extension to the segue survey have now been selected for spectroscopic followup on suspicion that they too may harbor this pattern ( ren et al .",
    "furthermore , most stars forming in the ashes of very massive primordial sne were likely enriched to metallicities above those targeted by surveys of metal - poor stars to date ( karlsson et al .",
    "2008 ) , and our simulations predict that second - generation stars formed from gas enriched by sms sne will have metallicities above @xmath80z@xmath1 , which are also above this threshold . we conclude that , while sms sne are almost certainly rare events , their chemical signature might well be found in some of the ancient but not very metal - poor stars inhabiting our galaxy today .",
    "we have carried out a multi - scale simulation of the explosion of a @xmath89m@xmath1 sms , which , with an energy approaching @xmath33erg , is among the biggest explosions in the history of the universe . with our multi - code approach ,",
    "we have captured self - consistently , and for the first time , the essential radiation hydrodynamic features of the explosion at early times and the interaction of the blast wave with its host protogalaxy and with the igm at later times .    although the atomic cooling halos expected to host the formation of smss are at least two orders of magnitude more massive than the dm halos in which the first primordial stars are expected to form , we have found that these sms sne are energetic enough to completely evacuate them of dense gas .",
    "the metal - enriched ejecta is dispersed well beyond the @xmath90kpc virial radius of the host halo , out to @xmath91@xmath74kpc into the low - density igm , after @xmath92myr . by this time",
    ", @xmath93 of the kinetic energy in the explosion has been radiated away ; nonetheless , the expansion of the shock into the igm continues even at these late times , as the remaining kinetic energy is still comparable to that expected for a @xmath94m@xmath1 pop  iii psn .    because of the deep potential well of the halo and ongoing accretion from filaments , after @xmath79myr a fraction of the metal - enriched gas in the sn remnant , shown in fig .",
    "7 , has recollapsed to high densities .",

    "<S> supermassive primordial stars are expected to form in a small fraction of massive protogalaxies in the early universe , and are generally conceived of as the progenitors of the seeds of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> supermassive stars with masses of @xmath0m@xmath1 , however , have been found to explode and completely disrupt in a supernova ( sn ) with an energy of up to @xmath2erg instead of collapsing to a bh . </S>",
    "<S> such events , @xmath3 times more energetic than typical sne today , would be among the biggest explosions in the history of the universe . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a simulation of such a sn in two stages . using the rage radiation hydrodynamics code </S>",
    "<S> we first evolve the explosion from an early stage through the breakout of the shock from the surface of the star until the blast wave has propagated out to several parsecs from the explosion site , which lies deep within an atomic cooling dark matter ( dm ) halo at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> then , using the gadget cosmological hydrodynamics code we evolve the explosion out to several kiloparsecs from the explosion site , far into the low - density intergalactic medium . the host dm halo , with a total mass of @xmath5m@xmath1 , much more massive than typical primordial star - forming halos , is completely evacuated of high density gas after @xmath6myr , although dense metal - enriched gas recollapses into the halo , where it will likely form second - generation stars with metallicities of @xmath7z@xmath1 after @xmath8myr . the chemical signature of supermassive star explosions may be found in such long - lived second - generation stars today . </S>"
