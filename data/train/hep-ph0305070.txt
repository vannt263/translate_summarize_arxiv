    "following the first evidence of partonic substructure of the nucleon , by means of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , a large amount of experimental data have been collected in order to understand the parton structure of the nucleon .",
    "it is currently known that the @xmath2 evolution behavior of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) is well described by perturbative qcd .",
    "however , the parton distributions at an initial scale reflect the nonperturbative quark and gluon dynamics of qcd bound states , which can not be determined from first principles . for this reason ,",
    "many parametrizations have been proposed  @xcite , but most of these expressions involve a large number of free parameters , with no clear physical meaning .",
    "however , some efforts have been recently made  @xcite to parametrize unpolarized and polarized nucleon pdf based on a statistical approach  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon pdf , which involve in this framework a small number of free parameters , can well describe all available experimental unpolarized and polarized dis data , so this is perhaps an indication that the pdf retain some important statistical features of the nucleon .",
    "the statistical approach of the nucleon pdf allows to make predictions , which were tested recently in a satisfactory way , by various experimental data in dis @xcite . in order to extend further this framework to new areas ,",
    "it is natural to envisage , for example , its application to the description of the pdf of the other octet baryons .",
    "unfortunately , these pdf are not directly accessible because , due to their short lifetimes , the hyperons can not be used as a target in a dis experiment .    however , it is well known that the quark distributions in a hadron @xmath3 , @xmath4 are related to the corresponding quark to hadron fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath5 , by means of the so called gribov - lipatov relations  @xcite .",
    "this connection between two basic quantities of the hadron structure has been used in several recent works @xcite , as an attempt to improve our present poor knowledge on the hadron ff .",
    "so this is our motivation to extend the statistical approach to a global description of the octet baryon ff and to check its validity against the available experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we review the main points of the framework and we give the basic procedure for the construction of the octet baryons ff in the statistical approach , in terms of fermi - dirac distributions . in sect .",
    "3 , we determine all free parameters of the model by using some data on the inclusive production of proton and @xmath0 in unpolarized deep inelastic scattering and a next - to - leading ( nlo ) fit to the available experimental data on the production of unpolarized octet baryons in @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "the results of the fit for the cross sections and the obtained ff are also presented and we compare our approach with some previous works on baryon ff @xcite . finally in sec .",
    "4 , we give our conclusions .",
    "in the statistical approach , a hadron can be viewed as a gas of massless partons ( quarks , antiquarks , gluons ) in equilibrium at a given temperature , in a finite size volume . in hadron production ,",
    "when a parton fragments into a hadron , it picks up other partons from the qcd vacuum in order to form a specific hadron .",
    "the formation probability of the hadron is characterized by its statistical properties .",
    "therefore we believe that statistical features which were proposed to build up the nucleon pdf in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be used also to construct the ff for the octet baryons .",
    "we assume that the parton ( @xmath6 ) to hadron ( @xmath3 ) ff @xmath7 , at an input energy scale @xmath8 , is proportional to    @xmath9 \\pm 1]^{-1}~ , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where the _ plus _ sign for quarks and antiquarks , corresponds to a fermi - dirac distribution and the _ minus _ sign for gluons , corresponds to a bose - einstein distribution . here",
    "@xmath10 is a constant which plays the role of the _ thermodynamical potential _ of the quark hadronization into a hadron and @xmath11 is the _ universal temperature _ , which is assumed to be equal for all octet baryons .",
    "it is reasonable to take its value to be the same as for the nucleon pdf , i.e. @xmath12 , according to ref .",
    "the statistical approach for the pdf allows to construct quark distributions of a given helicity and it is also possible to relate simply quark to antiquark distributions , resulting from chiral properties of qcd , as explained in ref .",
    "all these physical quantities were determined precisely due to the existence of a hudge amount of data in unpolarized and polarized dis . in the case of the octect baryon ff , the situation is different and the sarcacity of the polarized data does not allow such a clear separation , so we will restrict ourselves to the determination of the unpolarized quark ff , although the extention to the polarized case can be easily done . for the quarks",
    "@xmath13 the ff are then expressed as    @xmath14 + 1 } , \\label{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the potential corresponding to the fragmentation @xmath16 and @xmath8 is an initial scale , given below in table 1 .",
    "we will ignore the antiquark ff @xmath17 , which are considered to be strongly suppressed .",
    "the heavy quark ff @xmath18 for @xmath19 , which are expected to be large only in the small @xmath20 region ( @xmath21 or so ) , are parametrized by a diffractive term with a vanishing potential @xmath22 the initial scale @xmath8 , which is flavor dependent in this case , is given below in table 1 .",
    "quark is above the highest energy data investigated in this work , it does not contribute to our analysis .",
    "] this ff for @xmath23 depends on @xmath24 and a normalization constant @xmath25 for each baryon @xmath26 .",
    "for the other quarks , we make some reasonable assumptions in order to reduce the number of parameters in addition to @xmath27 , the universal power of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "first we have the obvious constraints , namely , @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "moreover we assume that we need only _ four _ potentials , two for the proton @xmath30 and @xmath31 and two for the hyperons @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "finally for the gluon to baryon ff @xmath35 , which is hard to determine precisely , we take a bose - einstein expression with a vanishing potential @xmath36 we assume it has the same small @xmath20 behavior as the heavy quarks and it is the same for all baryons .",
    "the normalization constants @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 will have also to be determined by fitting the data , a procedure we present now .",
    "the experimental data which was used is twofold .",
    "first , hadron production in dis gives access to a direct determination of @xmath40 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite , in a limited range of @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have also determined the free parameters of the model by making an analysis of the differential cross section for the semi - inclusive hadron production process @xmath42 , for @xmath43 . here",
    "we note that in these experiments , they usually do not distinguish between @xmath26 and @xmath44 , so we will include both contributions in our calculations by making the natural assumption @xmath45 .",

    ", we made a conversion to @xmath50 in the following figures . ] the subscripts @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the contributions due to transverse and longitudinal polarizations , respectively .",
    "the summation @xmath53 includes quarks , antiquarks and gluon contributions . in the following",
    "we will set the renormalization and the factorization scales equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the definitions of the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 follow those of ref . @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ sigmatot ] ) , @xmath57 is the total cross section for the process . @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the color number and we shall take @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the qed fine structure constant and @xmath62 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the sum in the above equation should be over all active quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the electroweak charges in eq .",
    "( [ sigtot ] ) can be expressed as @xmath63 with @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the electric charge of the quarks and ( @xmath69 ) , ( @xmath70 ) the electroweak vector and axial couplings of the electron and the quarks to the @xmath71 , respectively .",

    "@xcite , where for the dglap equations we used the _ timelike _ splitting functions calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . for baryon production in @xmath1 collisions",

    "this agreement of our results with experimental data is satisfactory and it confirms that the statistical approach is also successful in the description of the octet baryons ff .    in figs .",
    "[ du - proton ] and [ du - lambda ] we display the available dis data , which yield directly @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the result of our fit . in figs .",
    "[ sigproton]-[sigxi ] we show a comparison of the calculated cross sections for various baryons with experimental data . in fig .",
    "[ sigproton ] , we give our results for the proton cross section in electron - positron annihilation at @xmath86 and at the z - pole _ i.e. _ @xmath87 .",
    "the agreement with data is very good even in the low @xmath88 region ( @xmath89 ) as shown on the same figure , although these data points were not included in our fit .    for the @xmath0 production ,",
    "our results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ siglam ] for the energies @xmath90 .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ sigproton ] and [ siglam ] , which display a sizeable energy domain , that the scaling violations in this range are very small . in order to improve the small @xmath88 behavior",
    ", we need to modify the evolution of the ff in this region , and also include finite mass corrections and modifications of the splitting functions ( see a discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but such corrections are outside the scope of the present paper . in fig .",
    "[ sigsigma ] we give our results for @xmath91 production at @xmath92 and in fig .",
    "[ sigxi ] our results for @xmath82 production at the z - pole . for these strangeness production processes ,",
    "our results show a satisfactory agreement .",
    "the corresponding quark to baryon ff are presented in fig .",
    "[ fragoctet ] . for all hyperons",
    "the strange quark ff dominates largely over the @xmath93 quarks , which seems natural . for @xmath0 , we are in agreement with a model for su(3 ) symmetry breaking in ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to @xmath94 . in ref .",
    "@xcite one also finds @xmath95 smaller than @xmath96 and @xmath97 is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath93 and @xmath98 are assumed to contribute equally .",
    "however the heavy quarks have a pattern similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , with a sizeable contribution only for @xmath21 and a fast dropping off for large @xmath20 .",
    "this is also at variance with ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath99 decreases from 1 to 0.2 when @xmath20 goes from 0 to 1 . for the proton it is surprizing to see that the @xmath100-quark ff dominates only at large @xmath20 , whereas the strange and heavy quarks contribute substantially for @xmath101 or so .",
    "finally we notice that for the @xmath0 , the heavy quarks have a pattern similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , with a sizeable contribution only for @xmath21 and a fast dropping off for large @xmath20 .",
    "with the motivation to check whether the octet baryons ff have similar statistical features as the nucleon pdf previously studied , we extended the statistical approach to analyze some data on the inclusive production of the octet baryons .",
    "we found that these ff can be well described with a small number of free parameters , whose interpretion was discussed .",
    "we obtained a satisfactory description of the unpolarized experimental data , suggesting that the statistical approach , with fermi - dirac type ff , works equally well , compared to other parametrization forms .",
    "the semi - inclusive dis data for proton and @xmath0 production , which give strong constraints , have allowed a flavor separation between @xmath93 and @xmath98 quarks ff , an interesting result which remains to be more seriously checked in the future .    in our present analysis ,",
    "we did not introduce polarized ff , although our formalism can be easily extended to this case . actually , it is impossible to extract some reliable information on the polarized ff for the moment , due to the scarcity of the data , but we hope this will be possible in the future .",
