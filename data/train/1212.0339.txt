    "there are many models for the equilibrium behavior of long polymers but few for their dynamics .",
    "the celebrated rouse model  @xcite describes the temporal behavior of the chain by a set of ( rouse ) modes in a harmonic potential .",
    "such a rouse ( or fantom ) chain is however too flexible to describe the behavior of biological polymers .",
    "for instance the persistence length of a rouse chain is zero , while e.g. double - stranded ( ds ) dna persists in its orientation over some hundred base pairs .",
    "it is easy to dress the rouse model with a term that suppresses bending of the chain , while preserving the dynamics in the form of a set of independent rouse modes .",
    "however , the behavior of such a chain under an external force , i.e. the force extension curve , does still not correspond to that of the semiflexible biopolymers , as it responds to the force as a harmonic spring , while the semiflexible chain has a characteristic rapid increase of the extension for small forces , crossing over to a slow linear increase with the force .",
    "clearly rouse - type chains have too little rigidity against longitudinal forces .",
    "an opposite approach is to represent the biopolymer as a worm - like chain @xcite , which is a continuum description with the appropriate stiffness against bending .",
    "the worm - like chain ( wlc ) keeps a fixed contour length and only undergoes transversal undulations .",
    "a microscopic realization of the worm - like chain is the model in which the monomers are connected by rigid bonds .",
    "the bending stiffness is incorporated in the hamiltonian by a term suppressing the angle between two successive bonds .",
    "the rigidity of the bonds guarantees the invariance of the contour - length under the possible motion of the monomers .",
    "we refer to this model as the `` jointed chain '' ( in analogy with the well known freely - jointed chain @xcite ) .",
    "a refinement is to let the bond length vary with the external force .",
    "such an `` extensible jointed chain '' can very well reproduce the measured force - extension curve of bio - polymers by an appropriate choice of the bending stiffness . a model close to the extensible jointed chain",
    "has recently been introduced by kierfeld et al .",
    "@xcite , who extensively discuss its equilibrium properties .",
    "however , the dynamics of jointed chains is quite involved , as the motion of the monomers is strongly constrained by the rigidity of the bonds , which introduces unphysical long - range correlation .",
    "e.g. the motion between the end monomers of the chain is correlated due to the constant length of the contour .",
    "thus a polymer model that can treat the dynamics of biological polymer fragments , such as occuring in networks , is quite welcome .",
    "these fragments are of the order of the persistence length , rendering a continuum description not adequate and a description on base - pair level necessary . in this paper",
    "we propose such a model combining to a large extend the mathematical simplicity of the rouse model , while describing accurately the experimental force - extension curve .",
    "the hamiltonian for our flexible and extensible chain reads : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the bond vector between monomer @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 the end - to - end vector @xmath11 @xmath12 is the position of the @xmath9-th monomer ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 is a force tending to orient and stretch the chain .",
    "the first term in ( [ a1 ] ) is a single - bond harmonic interaction , providing the length scale @xmath15 and the energy parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the second term is a nearest - neighbor - bond interaction giving the model a bending stiffness measured by @xmath17 .",
    "the above defined hamiltonian is the simplest of a class of hamiltonians with bond interactions , not only between nearest neighbors as in ( [ a1 ] ) , but also longer - ranged interactions .",
    "if we set @xmath18 the model reduces to that of marques and frederickson @xcite ( with slightly different boundary conditions ) . as we mentioned above , such a rouse - like model does not have an acceptable force - extension curve .",
    "we will argue that a finite @xmath15 changes the properties from being rather unrealistic to realistic .",
    "the difference between our model and that of kierfeld et al.@xcite is minor as far as the equilibrium properties are concerned .",
    "however the difference is major with respect to the dynamics .",
    "while in @xcite the bending energy only depends on the angle between the bonds , in our case it depends on the bond vectors .",
    "the angles are dynamically very inconvenient parameters : changing one angle while keeping the others fixed , involves the motion of a whole segment of the chain . in our model monomer positions",
    "can be changed independently , only changing the incident bond vectors of that monomer .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the mechanical and statistical properties of the model .",
    "we formulate the dynamical equations for the monomer positions , as well as those for an equivalent description in terms of the modes of the system .",
    "we also give a few implications of the mode equations . in a subsequent study we design an efficient scheme for the solution of the dynamical equations and report on extensive simulations of the model .",
    "by varying the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath17 we cover a wide range of physical systems .",
    "we can eliminate the value of a finite @xmath15 from the problem by scaling @xmath7 with @xmath15 .",
    "then the hamiltonian reads @xmath20 thus @xmath15 can be absorbed in the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath15 does not show up directly in the expressions for the static and dynamic properties . to translate the properties to a real chain one",
    "has to multiply the bond vectors with a well chosen @xmath15 .",
    "the form ( [ a3 ] ) shows that @xmath18 is a singular point of the hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) . amongst others ,",
    "the case @xmath18 has a lowest energy state in which all bond lengths vanish .",
    "as our main interest is in describing biological polymers , which have a fairly rigid bond length and a large persistence length , we consider large values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "so it is useful to consider the ratio between @xmath16 and @xmath17 as characteristic for the model . as we will see their common magnitude couples to the temperature",
    "so we write @xmath23 and the hamiltonian gets the form that we will use in this paper : @xmath24 with the abbreviation @xmath25 equilibrium is governed by the ratio @xmath26 , which we write as @xmath27 where the reduced temperature @xmath28 equals @xmath29 thus the combination @xmath30 is absorbed in the reduced temperature @xmath28",
    ". we will discuss the model in terms of the dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "large values of @xmath16 manifest themselves in low values of @xmath28 , implying a fairly constant bond length . assuming a constant bond length reduces the model to the jointed chain and indeed the force - extension curve of our model closely follows that of the extensible jointed chain .",
    "for the analysis of the model we split the hamiltonian in three parts according to the power in which the bond vectors ( or monomer positions ) occur : @xmath33 the first term , containing the quadratic terms in the bond vectors , has the form @xmath34 it is instructive to compare this hamiltonian with the one used by marques and frederickson @xcite , which , using our parameters , reads @xmath35 one observes that stability requires the bound @xmath36 , which we also have to impose on ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "close inspection shows that ( [ a10 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) are the same , apart from two boundary terms : @xmath37 and @xmath38 occur in ( [ a10 ] ) with the coefficient @xmath39 , while in ( [ a11 ] ) they have the weight @xmath40 . for the polymer properties this difference is of little importance , but the form ( [ a10 ] )",
    "permits exact diagonalization in closed form , while for ( [ a11 ] ) one has to rely on numerical diagonalization .",

    "it prevents however an exact diagonalization of the model , which is possible for the harmonic terms .",

    "the last term in ( [ a9 ] ) is a trivial constant having no influence , neither on the equilibrium nor on the dynamics ; we will pay no further attention to it .",
    "the dynamics of the model is our main interest .",

    "we find that for small @xmath28 , @xmath61 is still close to the value ( [ b3 ] ) .",
    "the ground state energy responds harmonically to small deviations , yielding a quadratic increase in the energy .",
    "we first discuss the force free case .",
    "one can find the hessian matrix by twice differentiating the hamiltonian with respect to the positions of the monomers .",
    "as the dependence on the monomer positions is exclusively through the bond vectors , we use the rule @xmath62 and define the bond matrix @xmath63 the indices in the matrix @xmath64 run between @xmath65 .",

    "since @xmath83 evaluation of the derivative yields @xmath84 this tensor projects out the longitudinal eigenmodes and is unity for the transversal modes .",
    "longitudinal and transversal relate to the direction of the vector @xmath85 . thus the longitudinal modes are given by ( [ b9]-[b10 ] ) .",
    "we put this in formula for the decay constants @xmath86 of the longitudinal mode @xmath1 @xmath87    the two transversal modes are corrected by the term ( [ b14 ] ) , which is diagonal in the matrix indices .",
    "the diagonal contribution to @xmath64 of the quadratic terms in the hamiltonian equals 1 .",
    "so if we define @xmath88 @xmath89 becomes the diagonal matrix element .",

    "for the large values of @xmath16 ( or small values of @xmath28 ) , one gets a good impression of the orientation correlation function , by taking the bond lengths as rigid , i.e. by studying the extensible jointed chain , for which the orientation correlation function can be calculated exactly ( see appendix [ bond ] ) .",

    "thus the response is linear in @xmath46 : @xmath105 in the forceless average only the diagonal components survive .",

    "this holds only for @xmath112 as for all @xmath113 the end - to - end vector will vanish for @xmath51 , due to rotational invariance .",
    "indeed the point @xmath114 is singular and the value of @xmath115 depends on the way this point is approached .    the complete curve will be a smooth transition between the fast initial rise ( till @xmath116 is of the order @xmath117 ) and the slow rise of ( [ b9 ] ) , manifesting itself when @xmath32 becomes of the order 1 .",

    "[ decay ] we show their behavior as function of mode index @xmath1 and length @xmath0 .",
    "the striking feature is the large difference in decay coefficient for the slow longitudinal and transversal modes .",
    "the decay as @xmath208 , characteristic for the worm - like chain , has often lead to the conclusion that the slowest modes in the system show correlations over a time scale increasing as @xmath209 .",
    "this is however not the case , a fortiori not for transversal mode @xmath94 , having a vanishing decay constant .",
    "if one starts from a ground state with a certain orientation and looks at the evolution on a time scale of order @xmath210 , then the longitudinal modes have come to equilibrium , while the transversal components still fluctuate away from the chosen ground - state configuration .",
    "in fact they cause a diffusion in orientation , while keeping the shape of the polymer more or less fixed .",
    "the problem of diffusion of a rigid rod has already been considered by j.  m.  burgers in 1938 @xcite .",
    "he calculated the rotational diffusion constant @xmath211 for a rigid rod with moment of inertia @xmath212 as @xmath213 where we have inserted the moment of inertia of the ground state @xmath214 ; here , we recollect that @xmath59 is the distance between monomers .",
    "this corresponds with a rotational relaxation time @xmath215 which is indeed of the order @xmath210 .",
    "thus on the scale of @xmath216 , the orientation of the original ground state has diffused away and the slow time scale @xmath217 of the transversal modes will not be observed .",
    "it is interesting to compare the decay times @xmath218 of the transversal modes with this rotational - diffusion time scale @xmath216 . using ( [ b21 ] ) we find @xmath219 this formula seems to indicate that @xmath218 is a factor @xmath0 larger than @xmath216 .",
    "however , relation ( [ e9 ] ) assumes that the persistence length @xmath99 exceeds the length @xmath220 .",
    "so the autocorrelation time @xmath218 for the amplitude of mode @xmath221 is significantly _ smaller _ than @xmath216 .",
    "thus , the scaling of the decay time proportional to @xmath209 should not be seen as an indication that semiflexible polymers have very long times for small @xmath1 , but as an indication that their high-@xmath1 degrees of freedom decay very quickly .",
    "we have discussed properties of a polymeric chain characterised by a simple hamiltonian , in the high viscosity limit with uncorrelated noise . we feel that our model fills a gap in the spectrum of models with respect to the dynamics of polymers for the following reasons .    1 .   with only two adaptable parameters @xmath28 and @xmath98",
    ", the model interpolates between a worm - like chain and the rouse model . depending on the length of the polymer , short or long with respect to the persistence length , the properties are either more worm - like or more rouse - like .",
    "this is important for the dynamics of fragments of biological polymers such as dsdna , which neither are worm - like nor are well described by a rouse model .",

    "@xcite contains also two adaptable parameters : persistence length @xmath99 and the force constant @xmath121 . in section [ choice ]",
    "we show how to make a map between @xmath99 and @xmath121 on the one hand and our model parameters @xmath28 and @xmath98 on the other hand .",
    "the correspondence between the force - extension curve of our model and that of wang et al .",
    "is excellent , as fig .",
    "[ force ] shows .",
    "we point out that our model also enables to discuss the force - extension of short polymer fragment as occurring in networks .",
    "the appendix contains the details of such a finite - size analysis .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the model are close to that of the model of kierfeld et al . @xcite .",
    "the difference is that we use for the bending energy the inner product of two adjacent bond vectors , while ( commonly ) the cosine of the angle between the bonds is used .",
    "our model allows to have the monomer positions as unconstrained dynamical variables , whereas it is awkward to formulate the dynamics in terms of the angles .",
    "4 .   the dynamics of the model admits a description in terms of modes , showing clearly the wide spectrum of time scales from short for high - indexed modes till very long for the important low - indexed modes .",
    "two types of modes exist . for polymers much shorter than the persistence length , the mechanical modes ( described in section [ modes ] ) are relevant . for longer chains the rouse modes are the more convenient representation . since the modes have a wide spectrum of properties we have the opportunity to focus on slow and large scale phenomena and to suppress the role of the fast short - range behavior , which normally greatly slows down the calculations .",
    "the model has several options for improvement .",
    "one could introduce further bond interactions to make the model more suited to described specific polymers . in the same spirit",
    "one could add hydrodynamic interactions like in the zimm model @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent paper we describe further results of simulations of this model for realistic parameters @xmath28 and @xmath98 applying to bio - polymers .",
    "we there show how the simulation can be speeded up by orders of magnitude permitting to study chains of the order of 1000 base pairs , which makes the rouse modes a convenient description of the dynamics .",

    "[ force ] .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the properties of the chain in which the bonds all have the length @xmath223 .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence of this bond length derives from the stretching of the bonds due to the force .",
    "fixing the bond length reduces the degrees of freedom to the orientations of the bonds , given by the polar angle @xmath224 between the bond and the direction of the force and the azimuth angle @xmath225 in a plane perpendicular to the force .",
    "so the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath226 @xmath227 is the angle between the bonds @xmath9 and @xmath228 .",
    "we observe that , apart from a trivial additive term , the hamiltonian contains two dimensionless parameters @xmath229 the partition function thus is obtained as @xmath230,\\ ] ] where the trace is an integration over all angles @xmath231 . for the evaluation we use the expansion in terms of the legendre",
    "polynomials @xmath232 with the @xmath233 the @xmath234th legendre polynomial .",
    "the coefficients @xmath235 are recovered as the integrals @xmath236 these elementary integrals , related to the modified half - integer bessel - functions , can be calculated successively using the recurrence relations between the legendre polynomials .",
    "a legendre polynomial is subsequently expanded in the bond angles as @xmath237 with the @xmath238 as spherical harmonics .",
    "the advantage of this expression is that the relative angle between the bonds is expressed in terms of products of function of the the angles of the bonds in a fixed coordinate system .",
    "next we formulate the partition function as a matrix product .",
    "the first step is the integration over the azimuth angles @xmath225 .",
    "the angle @xmath239 appears only in the first joint between 1 and 2 .",
    "so its integration selects the term @xmath240 , as all the higher @xmath241 integrate to zero .",
    "this implies that also the angle @xmath242 disappears from the product , since @xmath243 subsequently one can integrate over @xmath242 and so on , each integration over an azimuth angle contributing a factor @xmath244 .",
    "the remaining integration over the @xmath224 is of the type with @xmath245 @xmath246^{1/2 } \\over 2 } \\int^1_{-1 } dz p_k ( z ) \\",

    "we now define the transfer matrix @xmath248 which allows us to write the partition function as @xmath249 with the definition of the initial state @xmath250 @xmath251 ) to make the definition of @xmath252 symmetric .    by expression ( [ a11 ] )",
    "the problem of calculating the partition function is reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath253 .",
    "for very long chains the largest eigenvalue will dominate .",
    "however , since the persistence length is long , this limit will only be reached when the chain has several thousands of bonds .",
    "therefore we also investigate the finite chain for which one has to take into account all the eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained from the equations @xmath254 then we use the representation @xmath255 note that for small @xmath256 , i.e. for weak forces , the matrix @xmath257 reduces to @xmath258 because the definition is just the orthogonality relation between legendre polynomials",
    ". then the eigenvalues of @xmath253 are given by the factor @xmath235 and one of their properties is that they decrease with increasing @xmath234 .",
    "thus for @xmath259 , i.e. forces @xmath260 , it suffices to restrict the matrix @xmath261 to a finite square in the upper - left corner .",
    "this simplifies the problem considerably since , both for the @xmath235 and the @xmath262 , simple recursions relation exist , enabling to construct them from the first few values . even for larger",
    "@xmath256 one does not need to include an excessive number of states to get an accurate answer .",
    "the partition function itself is not the main goal of the above exercise .",
    "we now apply this approach to the calculation of the force extension curve and the orientation correlation function . for the former we need the sum of the averages of @xmath263 ( see ( [ b7 ] ) ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath263 means the extra matrix @xmath264 at position @xmath265 in the matrix product , with @xmath266^{1/2 } \\over 2 } \\int^1_{-1 } dz p_k ( z ) \\ , z \\ , p_l ( z).\\ ] ] this integral equals @xmath267^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] as we plan to take the eigenfunctions @xmath261 as basis , we transform the matrix @xmath264 to that basis : @xmath268 in the same way we transform the @xmath269 vector : @xmath270 the partition function is now obtained as @xmath271 in the infinite long chain limit only the largest eigenvalues @xmath272 contributes .",
    "the numerator of the end - to - end vector gives the sum over all positions of the @xmath263 , or matrices @xmath273 in the product .",
    "we may write this as @xmath274 the factor @xmath275 accounts for all the ways the @xmath273 can be put on the bonds . on the left of the @xmath273 one will have the state @xmath56 and on the right @xmath276 .",
    "so @xmath275 is given by @xmath277 dividing ( [ a20 ] ) by @xmath0 will give the extension , i.e.  the ratio between the end - to - end vector and the contour length .",
    "as mentioned in the limit of an infinite chain we may restrict the summations over @xmath56 and @xmath276 to @xmath278 .",
    "for the orientation correlation we consider the infinitely long chain , as its definition should not be mudded by finite - size effects .",
    "we repeat the definition of the orientation correlation for the approximation considered in this appendix : @xmath279 the first term gives the contribution of the longitudinal component , the second gives the transversal component ( with respect to the force direction ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the first contribution , since we are mostly interested the persistence length of the force - free chain for which the eigenvalue problem is trivial . without an external force",
    "the longitudinal and transversal components are equal .",
    "the appearance of two terms @xmath280 and @xmath263 gives an insertion of the matrix @xmath264 at the bonds @xmath281 and @xmath265 .",
    "outside the interval @xmath282 the chain is in the state @xmath283 .",
    "inside the interval it may be in any of the eigenstates @xmath284 of @xmath261 .",
    "thus we arrive at the expression for the average @xmath285 for the force - free chain this expression reduces considerably .",
    "as we mentioned for @xmath286 the matrix @xmath257 reduces to @xmath258 and each @xmath234 is an eigenstate of @xmath253 with eigenvalue @xmath235 .",
    "therefore the @xmath273 matrix with upper indices is the same as the one with lower indices .",
