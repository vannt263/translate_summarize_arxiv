    "interestingly enough , although isolated neutron stars ( inss ) were discovered in the radio band as sources of strongly beamed radiation ( hewish et al . 1968 ) , hence dubbed _ pulsars _ , one object of this class had been already observed for many years back in the optical band .",
    "this is the baade s star , a quite bright object ( @xmath0 ) located at the centre of the crab nebula in the taurus constellation .",
    "it was only after the discovery of a bright radio pulsar ( np 0532 ) at the centre of the crab nebula ( comella et al .",
    "1969 ) that the baade s star was indeed recognised to be a possible ins and certified as such by the discovery of optical pulsations at the radio period ( cocke et al .",
    "almost a decade passed before the optical identification of another ins : the vela pulsar ( psr b0833@xmath145 ) , one of the faintest objects ever detected on photographic plates ( @xmath2 ; lasker 1976 ) , soon after identified as an optical pulsar ( wallace et al .",
    "1977 ) . while the first optical studies of isolated neutron stars ( inss ) initially focussed on radio pulsars , other classes of inss , typically radio - silent , were progressively discovered at x - ray and @xmath3-ray energies and became interesting targets for optical , near - ultraviolet ( uv ) and near - infrared ( ir ) observations .",
    "these are the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , the _ magnetar",
    "_ candidates ( see mereghetti 2008 ; 2009 ) , the x - ray dim inss ( xdinss ; haberl 2007 ; trmper 2009 ) , and the central compact objects ( ccos ) in snrs ( de luca 2008 ) . at variance with radio pulsars which are powered by the neutron star rotation ( gold 1968 ; pacini 1968 ) , and then are usually referred as rotation - powered pulsars ( rpps ) , these inss radiate through different emission mechanisms like , e.g. the decay of an hyper - strong magnetic field , for the magnetars , or the cooling of the neutron star surface , for the xdinss . at the same time",
    ", peculiar radio - loud inss were also discovered , like the high - magnetic field radio pulsars ( hbrps ; camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) and the rotating radio transients ( rrats ; mc laughlin 2009 ) . in many cases , optical or nir counterparts",
    "have been identified both for the xdinss and for the magnetars , while no counterpart has been found so far for the ccos , the hbrps , and the rrats .",
    "thus , despite of their intrinsic faintness which makes them very elusive targets , nuv , optical , and nir ( hereafter uvoir ) observations proved quite successful in detecting inss outside the radio band , thanks to both the _ hst _  and to the new 8m - class telescopes , like the _ vlt_. + forty years after the optical identification of the crab pulsar , uvoir studies of inss represent an important tile to complete an understand the multi - wavelength phenomenology of these objects ( see also mignani 2009a ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : i review the uvoir identification status of rpps , xdinss , and magnetars in  2 , while i describe their full observation database and their emission properties in  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the observation status of the ccos , the hbrps , and the rrats is described in  4 .",
    "the importance of uvoir observations for ins studies and future perspectives are summarised in  5 .",
    "being the first class of inss detected at uvoir wavelengths , the major observational effort has been devoted so far to the search and to the study of rpps which , indeed , score the largest number of ins identifications .",
    "out of the @xmath4 rpps listed in the updated atnf radio catalogue , twelve have been identified at uvoir wavelengths , albeit with different levels of confidence . + after the identification of the crab and vela pulsars , the major advances in the uvoir studies of inss were achieved thanks to observations performed with the eso _ ntt _  in the late 1980s and in the 1990s ( see , e.g. mignani et al .",
    "2000 for a review ) .",
    "these yielded to the identification of the optical counterparts to the first radio - silent ins , geminga ( bignami et al .",
    "1993 ) , to the first extra - galactic ins , psr b0540@xmath169 in the lmc ( caraveo et al .",
    "1992 ) , and to psr b0656 + 14 ( caraveo et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the refurbishment of the _ hst _  in 1993 represented a major turn - off in uvoir studies of inss ( see , e.g. mignani 2007 ) , yielding to the nuv identification of psr b0950 + 08 , psr b1929 + 10 ( pavlov et al . 1996 ) , psr b1055@xmath152 ( mignani et al . 1997 ) , and of psr j0437@xmath14715 , the first ms - pulsar detected at uvoir wavelengths ( kargaltzev et al .",
    "2004 ) . moreover , _ hst _  observations allowed to study , for the first time , the morphology and evolution of pulsar - wind nebulae ( pwne ) around the crab pulsar ( hester et al .",
    "1995 ) and psr b0540@xmath169 ( caraveo et al . 2000 ) . in the 2000s , observations with the _ vlt _   ( see mignani 2009 for a recent review ) yielded to the identification of the optical counterparts to psr b1509@xmath158 ( wagner & seifert 2000 ) and , more recently , to psr b1133 + 16 ( zharikov et al . 2008 ) and psr j0108@xmath11431 ( mignani et al .",

    "( 2008a ) to find that the position of the candidate counterpart ( @xmath7 ) nicely fitted the backward proper motion extrapolation of the pulsar and , thus , to certify its identification _ a posteriori_. for many objects , the faintness of the optical counterpart ( @xmath8 ) initially prevented the use of the straightforward optical timing identification technique , successfully used for the brighter crab and vela pulsars and for psr b0540@xmath169 ( shearer et al .",
    "1994 ) . in some cases ,",

    "the identification was later strengthened by the detection of nuv pulsations with the _ hst _  ( kargaltsev & pavlov 2007 ) . for the others ,",
    "the identification evidence mainly relies on the positional coincidence with the ins coordinates ( psr b1133 + 16 and psr j0108@xmath11431 ) , on the peculiar colours or spectrum of the candidate counterpart ( psr b0950 + 08 ) , on the possible evidence of optical polarisation ( psr b1509@xmath158 ) .",

    "unfortunately , optical / nuv observations of magnetars are hampered by the high interstellar extinction ( up to @xmath22 ) in the direction of the galactic plane , where most of them were discovered .",

    "it is interesting to note how all magnetar identifications were achieved with ground - based telescopes , mostly with the _ vlt _ , while the _ hst _   did not play a significant role , partially because its nir camera ( _ nicmos _ ) was unavailable between 1999 and 2002 . however , unless a more accurate source position is available from radio observations like , e.g. in the case of the two transient radio axps xte j1810@xmath1197 and 1e1540.0@xmath15408 ( camilo et al .",

    "given the source distance and the longer required time span , proper motion measurements are not a very efficient identification tool like , e.g. in the case of rpps and xdinss , while the search for nir pulsations at the x - ray period requires suitable instruments which are usually not available at most telescopes .",
    "indeed , optical pulsations have been detected from two axps ( see below ) using guest instrument facilities .",
    "moreover , the still significant interstellar extinction , together with the uncertainty on the source distance and the difficulty of finding a well - defined spectral template for magnetars , makes a colour - based identification uncertain .",
    "thus , in most cases the best recipe for nir identifications of magnetars is based on the measurement of correlated ir / x - ray variability .",

    "this suggests that either the neutron star surface temperature was raised through the effect of re - heating processes occurring in its interior ( e.g. , page 2009 ; tsuruta 2009 ) or it was raised by accretion from its companion star during a past pulsar spin - up phase . like for the old ms - pulsar psr j0437@xmath14715 , re - heating might have occurred also for the 200 million year old psr j0108@xmath11431 ( mignani et al .",
