    "gr predicts that orbits about a massive central body suffer periastron shifts yielding _ rosette _ shapes .",
    "however , the classical perturbing effects of other objects on inner orbits give an opposite shift .",
    "since the periastron advance depends strongly on the compactness of the central body , the detection of such an effect may give information about the nature of the central body itself .",
    "this would apply for stars orbiting close to the gc , where there is a dark object \" , the black hole hypothesis being the most natural explanation of the observational data .",
    "a cluster of stars in the vicinity of the gc ( at a distance @xmath5 ) has been monitored by eso and keck teams for several years ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , ghez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have reported on observations of several stars orbiting close to the gc massive black hole . among those ,",
    "the s2 star , with mass @xmath6 m@xmath1 , appears to be a main sequence star orbiting the black hole with a keplerian period of @xmath7 yrs .",
    "this yields @xcite a mass estimate of @xmath8 within @xmath9 pc , that is the s2 semi - major axis .",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility of measuring the gr corrections to newtonian orbits for sgr  a@xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , usually assuming that the central body is a schwarzschild black hole . however , since black holes generally rotate , and there is no reason why they should not be rotating fast , the kerr metric should be used instead .",
    "not only stellar mass black holes but also supermassive black holes are believed to be spinning . indeed , x - ray observations of seyfert galaxies , microquasars and binary systems ( @xcite and references therein ) show that the data could be explained by a rotating black hole model ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . further , supermassive black holes at the center of qsos , agns and galaxies show beamed jet emission implying that they have non zero angular momentum .",
    "hence , kerr black holes may be fairly common in nature .",
    "the relatively short orbital period of the s2 star encourages a search for genuine gr effects like the orbital periastron shift .",
    "quite possibly , more suitable stars , close to the gc black hole , will be found in the future .",
    "bini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied the gr periastron shift around sgr  a@xmath2 and estimated it for various solutions belonging to the weyl class , including the schwarzschild and kerr black holes .",
    "however , they did not take into account the presence of a stellar cluster , which could in principle be sizable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to try to find limits for the extent and density of the cluster about sgr  a@xmath2 and if those limits yield a measurement of its spin .",
    "clearly , a thorough knowledge of the cluster mass and density distribution is necessary to be able to infer the mass and spin of the black hole at the gc by measuring the periastron shift and subtracting the newtonian shift .",
    "unfortunately , the star cluster parameters are poorly known .",
    "however , the measure of the brownian motion of the central black hole due to the surrounding matter may be used to constrain the black hole to cluster mass ratio .",
    "the latest observations of the @xmath10 proper motion , @xmath11 km @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , is much tighter than the earlier one of @xmath13 km @xmath14 ( see reid , readhead , vermeulen et al .",

    ", the periastron shift is given by ( see e.g. weinberg , @xcite ) @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the test particle orbit , respectively .",
    "for a rotating black hole with spin parameter @xmath19 , the space - time is described by the kerr metric and , in the most favorable case of equatorial plane motion ( * a.v * = 0 ) , the shift is given by ( boyer and price @xcite , but see also bini et al .",
    "@xcite for more details ) @xmath20 which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ schshift ] ) for @xmath21 . in the more general case ,",
    "* a.v * @xmath22 , the expected periastron shift has to be evaluated numerically .    the expected periastron shifts ( mas / revolution ) , @xmath23 ( as seen from the center ) and @xmath24 ( as seen from earth at the distance @xmath25 kpc from the gc ) , for the schwarzschild and the extreme kerr black holes , for the s2 and s16 stars turn out to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "recall that @xmath34 notice that the differences between the periastron shifts for the schwarzschild and the maximally rotating kerr black hole is at most @xmath35 mas for the s2 star and @xmath36 mas for the s16 star . in order to make these measurements with the required accuracy",
    ", one needs to know the s2 orbit with a precision of at least @xmath37 @xmath38as .",
    "there is a proposal to improve the angular resolution of vlti with the prima facility ( @xcite but see also the related web - site ) , which , by using a phase referenced imaging technique , will get @xmath39 @xmath38as angular resolution .",
    "hence , at least in principle , the effect of a maximally rotating kerr black hole on the periastron shift of the s2 star can be distinguished from that produced by a schwarzschild black hole with the same mass .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly discuss the effect of a central star cluster on the periastron advance . in section 3",
    "we use the sgr  a@xmath2 brownian motion to constrain the black hole to star cluster mass ratio .",
    "then we consider whether the detection of the spin of the black hole from the periastron shift of the s2 star is possible , once the cluster density and size have been adequately constrained . in section 5",
    "we show how future measurements of the periastron shifts for at least three stars close to the gc black hole may be used to estimate the black hole mass and the star cluster mass density distribution . in the next section we consider what the observational requirements would be for adequate determination of the cluster parameters to be able to resolve the kerr effect . finally ,",
    "in section 7 , we present some concluding remarks .",
    "the star cluster surrounding the central black hole in the gc could be sizable .",
    "at least 17 members have been observed within 15 mpc up to now ( @xcite ) .",

    "the same is true for large enough core radii , corresponding to matter density profiles almost constant within the s2 orbit .",
    "@xmath92    figures [ orbite ] and [ shiftvscore ] show that the expected s2 periastron shift depends strongly on the total mass of the cluster . in particular",
    ", the shift due to the cluster is opposite in sign ( retrograde motion ) to the relativistic effect due to the black hole in the gc .",
    "moreover , for each value of the cluster mass and power law index , there exist two density profiles ( corresponding to two particular core radii ) which have total shift almost zero , implying that the periastron advance due to the cluster is equal ( in magnitude ) to the periastron shift due to the black hole .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that the transition from a prograde shift ( due to the black hole ) to retrograde shift ( due to the extended mass ) occurs at @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "this means that a small fraction of mass in the cluster drastically changes the overall shift .",
    "we would like to note that the assumption of the plummer model to describe the mass density distribution of the stellar cluster around the central black hole is an oversimplification .",

    "we require that the total mass enclosed within @xmath9 pc is @xmath107 .    in case _ a ) _ , the total s2 periastron shift is just the sum of the shift due to the black hole and the shift caused by the stellar cusp ( that contributes with the same sign ) .",
    "hence , the s2 shift turns out to be @xmath108 degree per revolution .    in case _",
    "b ) _ , by requiring that the total mass enclosed within @xmath9 pc is @xmath107 , we find that the dependence of the cusp mass and the induced s2 periastron shift on @xmath102 vanishes . indeed , in figure [ cusp1 ] , we give the mass enclosed within the distance @xmath54 for different values of @xmath58 .",
    "solid , dotted and dashed lines correspond to @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "figure [ cusp2 ] shows the expected s2 periastron shift as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "as noted before , the shift due to the cluster is opposite in sign with respect to that due to the black hole .",
    "moreover , for @xmath111 the total shift turns out to be zero since the contributions of the black hole and the cluster cancel out .",
    "it is noticing that , since in the case of cusp profiles the density gradient is larger than in the case of a usual ( @xmath88 ) plummer model , the value of the s2 periastron shift gets generally larger values .",
    "only if the plummer core radius is around @xmath112 mpc the resulting s2 periastron shifts are comparable in both cases .",
    "is shown for different fractions @xmath58 of the total mass @xmath59 contained within the s2 orbit .",

    "the stellar cluster is assumed to follow an @xmath113 density profile . ]    .",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to the s2 shift due to the black hole and to the stellar cusp , respectively .",
    "we note that the shift due to the stellar cusp is independent on the @xmath102 value , that , in this case , has been assumed to be larger than the s2 semi - major axis ( case _ b _ ) . ]",
    "we have then considered the superposition of a plummer model and a bahcall - wolf profile ( case _ c _ ) extended up to @xmath102 such as the cusp density at @xmath102 equals that of the plummer model at the same distance . here , if @xmath114 the s2 periastron shift will be practically equal to that caused by the plummer model ( see right panel in fig .",
    "6 ) since in this case the cusp will have a minor influence . on the contrary , for an extended cusp ( @xmath115 ) , the cusp effect on the s2 periastron shift will dominate reconciling with case @xmath116 .    as a last point",
    ", we mention that we have also considered the effect due to an extrapolation of the observed stellar density profile - the innermost point of which is the s2 star at a distance of 0.1- within @xmath104 . following @xcite and assuming a cusp stellar density profile , we find that the enclosed mass is in the range 30 - 300 @xmath117 ( for a constant mass density or a power law with index @xmath118 ) .",
    "therefore , the cusp effect on the s2 periastron shift is negligible since the corresponding @xmath58 is always greater than 0.99992 .",
    "however , we caution that the case under investigation in the present paper is different with respect to @xcite since we are assuming that a fraction of the mass contained within @xmath104 may be in a stellar cluster",
    ". hence , the cluster mass content may be larger , thus providing a stronger effect on the s2 periastron shift .",
    "we know that the mass of sgr  a@xmath2 within the s2 orbit is @xmath119 m@xmath1 to a high accuracy .",
    "though there is nothing definite known about the mass distribution , there is strong reason to believe that there is a black hole of several solar masses , possibly surrounded by a significant cluster . in principle",
    "the cluster mass could dominate over the black hole , be comparable to it or be dominated by it . that there _ is",
    "_ a cluster is highly likely on account of the large number of stars observed near sgr  a@xmath2 .",
    "though these lie outside the s2 orbit , many stars so far unseen probably do lie within the orbit as well . in this section",
    "we use current data on the brownian motion of sgr  a@xmath2 and the evaporation time for the putative cluster to put limits on the cluster mass and hence on the black hole mass .",
    "chatterjee , hernquist and loeb ( @xcite ) have developed a simple model to describe the dynamics of a massive black hole surrounded by a dense stellar cluster .",
    "the total force acting on the black hole is separated into two independent parts , one of which is the slowly varying force due to the stellar ensemble and the other the rapid stochastic force due to close stellar encounters . in the case of a stellar system with a plummer distribution ,",

    "( the same as the s2 star ) but semi - major axis 3 times smaller with respect to the s2 one . if the periastron shifts of both stars will be observed in the future the intersection between the corresponding contour lines gives information about the central stellar density profile . ]    as is evident from figures 8 - 10 , one can obtain estimates of the @xmath86 , @xmath122 and @xmath78 , provided that three stars have been observed to sufficient accuracy .",
    "assume that we have adequate accuracy of observation to see periastron shifts of 10@xmath181 mas , which is the value required to see the relativistic periastron shift .",
    "to what accuracy have we limited the cluster parameters ? to determine this , we could just vary @xmath58 for a given @xmath86 .",
    "the effect of this change would be less than the effect of changing @xmath86 _ and _ @xmath58 .",
    "as such , if we want to know how accurately the cluster parameters are determined , we need to calculate the maximum change in @xmath86 _ along with _ the change in @xmath58 , as allowed by the brownian motion limit . by varying @xmath58 by 10@xmath182 and @xmath86 maximally",
    "we find that we get the required accuracy , for evaporation rates from 1 to 10 gyr and brownian motion of 1.3 to 2.0 km s@xmath4",
    ". with this accuracy we should also be able to separate out the classical periastron shift of the stellar cluster and the relativistic effect of a maximal ( and even slightly less than maximal ) kerr black hole .",
    "with better accuracy we should be able to get an estimate , or at least an upper bound , for the black hole spin as well .",
    "the question now is , what is required to achieve this accuracy of observation of the periastron shift of three stars ?",
    "this point is discussed in the next section .",
    "in the near future , observations using large diameter telescopes in combination with adaptive optics may allow us to reach the angular resolution needed to measure the periastron shift of stars close to the gc back hole .",
    "consider for example an instrument with an angular resolution @xmath183 and assume that the relative position of stars can be determined to about @xmath184 of the achieved angular resolution , i.e. the position accuracy is @xmath185 .",
    "the positional accuracy can be increased by a factor @xmath186 , if @xmath187 reference stars are used . in this case , the maximum positional accuracy is simply given by ( @xcite ) @xmath188 it follows that if the periastron position of a star shifts by an amount @xmath189 ( as observed from earth ) , to obtain the desired accuracy we need at least that @xmath190 . in this case , the minimum number of reference stars can be determined once both the instrument angular and positional accuracies are known , i.e. @xmath191    as an example , the lbt interferometer has angular resolution @xmath192 mas and the relative position of stars is conservatively estimated to be about 1/30 of that value ( @xcite ) . therefore , to measure the periastron shift with adequate accuracy to see the least shift for the cluster parameters allowed , and thereby detect the relativistic shift , we need @xmath187 to be @xmath193 or 10@xmath194 reference stars , which automatically provides the accuracy required to see the maximal kerr ( spin ) effect . for prima ( see http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti/instru/prima/index_prima.html ) the relative positional accuracy is planned to be @xmath195as . as such , we only need a single reference star .",
    "we have used the fact that the stellar cluster close to the central black hole seems spherically symmetric to limit the brownian motion of sgr a@xmath2 to be the observed proper motion .",
    "we have taken the stronger ( 1@xmath174 ) limit of 1.3 km @xmath14 and the weaker ( 2@xmath174 ) limit of 2.0 km @xmath14 for our calculations .",
    "we also used evaporation times of 1 to 10 gyr for the cluster , appropriately modified to incorporate the gravitational well due to the black hole , to put further constraints on the cluster mass .",
    "the results of our calculations show that the stellar periastron shifts due to the cluster , even limited to the extent considered , may totally swamp not only the kerr ( spin ) effect but also the schwarzschild effect . however , the discussion focused on the observations for a single star , s2 . by modelling the star cluster density profile with a plummer low , the periastron shift contribution due to",
    "the stellar cluster depends on three parameters : the central density @xmath41 ( or equivalently @xmath78 ) , the core radius @xmath86 , and the power - law index @xmath122 .",
    "consequently , with observations of three stars we should be able to determine the cluster parameters adequately .",
    "( from fig . 8) .",
    "] we have addressed the question of what is required to obtain the desired accuracy for observing the relativistic effect .",
    "it turns out that we need about 10@xmath194 reference stars with the lbt interferometer . with",
    "the accuracy expected of prima , it should be enough to use only one reference star .",
