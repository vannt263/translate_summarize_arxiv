    "<S> carbon nanotube ( cnt ) josephson junctions in the open quantum dot limit exhibit superconducting switching currents which can be controlled with a gate electrode . </S>",
    "<S> shapiro voltage steps can be observed under radiofrequency current excitations , with a damping of the phase dynamics that strongly depends on the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are described by a standard rcsj model showing that the switching currents from the superconducting to the normal state are close to the critical current of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective dynamical capacitance of the nanotube junction is found to be strongly gate - dependent , suggesting a diffusive contact of the nanotube .    </S>",
    "<S> it was recently demonstrated that carbon nanotube ( cnt ) weak links , connecting two superconducting leads  @xcite , can be gate - controlled josephson junctions  @xcite and even gate - controlled @xmath0-junctions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first interesting application of cnt josephson junctions are superconducting transistors  @xcite and superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids )  @xcite , which are promising candidates for the detection of individual magnetic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> they might also prove useful as building blocks for more complicated superconducting devices  @xcite and new readout schemes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for all theses devices , the critical current @xmath1 and the high frequency response of cnt josephson junctions plays an important role , which is studied in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , previous investigations showed that the magnitude of the switching current @xmath2 of such cnt devices appeared to be very different from theoretical predictions : in the first experiments it was observed to be 10 times larger  @xcite and later 10 times smaller  @xcite than the result of ambegaokar and baratoff  @xcite , reformulated for a quantum dot ( qd ) in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all these previous measurements were performed for a static bias , without retrieving the effect of radiofrequency ( rf ) irradiation .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic transport through a cnt junction can be described by a qd in between two conducting leads . </S>",
    "<S> the energy level spacing @xmath3 depends on the length of the junction and the nature of the conducting leads . </S>",
    "<S> the transport can be classified into three limits depending on the ratio between the transparency @xmath4 of the qd barriers and the charging energy @xmath5  @xcite : ( i ) for @xmath6 , the maximum conductance at zero bias obeys @xmath7 . in this so - called closed qd regime </S>",
    "<S> the charging effects dominate the transport characterized by well - resolved coulomb blockade diamonds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) for @xmath8 holds @xmath9 . in this intermediate transparency regime charging effects as well as higher - order tunneling processes are very important . here </S>",
    "<S> , transport measurements show that coulomb blockade diamonds , corresponding to an odd number of electrons , are connected by kondo ridges  @xcite . for superconducting leads , higher - order multiple andreev reflections ( mars ) </S>",
    "<S> are well resolved  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) for @xmath10 , the conductance is close to @xmath11 and corresponds to the open qd regime ( the factor 4 reflects the two modes of the cnt band structure as well as the two spin orientations ) , where coulomb blockade diamonds are not observed . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a relatively high supercurrent for all gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> gate - modulated fabry - perot interferences can be observed in the last two regimes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of these devices is that backgate and sidegate electrodes can be used to vary both @xmath4 and the energy levels position in the nanotube , thus permitting to change the electric transport regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this tunability allowed us in a previous study to capture both kondo screened and unscreened junctions , leading to the observation of a @xmath12-@xmath0 transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we found that the qd barrier can be varied with the thickness of the pd contacts , enabling to access also all three transport regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> previous measurements on cnt josephson junctions were in the intermediated or closed qd regime  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first measurements in the open qd regime using a pd thickness of 7 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the present description concentrates on a single device , similar data were however obtained on a couple of other devices fabricated on the same chip .    </S>",
    "<S> the cnt josephson junction were fabricated as presented earlier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we started from a degenerately n - doped silicon substrate with 350 nm thick thermally grown sio@xmath13 layer on top used as a backgate . </S>",
    "<S> single - walled cnts were deposited using a combing technique  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nanotube location was imaged by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and aligned e - beam lithography patterned the contacts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the tube section between the contacts was about 200 nm . metal electrodes consisting of a thickness of 3 to 7 nm of pd followed by 50 nm of al , were deposited using electron - gun evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> pd provides high - transparency contacts to the carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> al is a superconductor having a critical temperature of about 1.2 k. the room temperature resistance varied between 10 and 60 k@xmath14 , strongly depending on the thickness of pd . </S>",
    "<S> only devices with no significant gate effect at room temperature were used for our studies . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for pd thicknesses below about 3 nm , the cnt junction was in the closed qd regime , for 4 to 6 nm in the intermediate , and for 7 nm and more in the open qd regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed in a shielded cryostat having heavily filtered lines in order to minimize the electronic noise reaching the sample , since electronic noise can reduce and even suppress the switching current of the cnt - squid . </S>",
    "<S> our home - built filtering system was presented in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we used mainly a four - probe , current - biased method . with a bias resistance of about 65 m@xmath14 at 4.5 k and voltage dividers at room temperature </S>",
    "<S> the voltage signal of the sample was first pre - amplified by a factor of 10@xmath15 and then measured using an oscilloscope or a look - in amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> high frequency ac current modulations in the frequency range between 1 and 12 ghz were induced via an inductive coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective bcs gap @xmath16 of the superconducting leads felt by the cnt was estimated by voltage versus current measurements as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we found a transition temperature @xmath17 = 0.7 k , yielding a @xmath16 = 1.76 @xmath18 = 0.1 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the energy level spacing of the cnt were determined @xmath19 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the high transparency of the contacts the effect of the coulomb energy is much smaller here .    . </S>",

    "<S> 1a and 1b , a magnetic field of @xmath23 = 50 mt was applied perpendicular to the electrode plane in order to suppress the superconductivity of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> the differential conductivity @xmath20 is plotted versus gate voltage at zero bias in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and , in addition , as a function of source - drain current @xmath22 in fig . 1b </S>",
    "<S> . @xmath20 oscillates between about 1.8 and 3.5 @xmath25 and is @xmath22-independent in the considered range . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is maximal when a quantum level of the cnt is aligned with respect to the fermi energy of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> a current can then flow by resonant tunneling through the cnt , and we denominate this regime as an on - state . when the quantum levels are far from the fermi energy , the current is reduced ( off - state ) . </S>",
    "<S> this cnt junction is clearly in the open qd regime because the reduction is only about a factor of two and coulomb blockade effects are not directly observable .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c presents the same measurements as in fig . 1b but with superconducting leads ( @xmath23 = 0 ) . because @xmath20 diverges </S>",
    "<S> , the differential resistivity @xmath24 is plotted . for small @xmath22 a supercurrent </S>",
    "<S> is observed , which is evidenced by a nearly zero - resistance state . at a certain bias current denoted by switching current @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the junction switches from the superconducting to the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is strongly gate - voltage dependent : it is maximal ( minimal ) in the on - state ( off - state ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the on - states are split into two @xmath2 maxima suggesting that there is still a small influence of coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> note that higher - order mars are not observed , which is probably due to strong broadening effects induced by the high transparency contacts .        </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b show typical voltage versus current curves at several temperatures for the on- and off - state . </S>",
    "<S> the on - state is characterized by the largest @xmath2 and small hysteresis effects , that is the retrapping current is close to @xmath2 . furthermore , @xmath24 increase for @xmath26 in the considered range . in the off - state , </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis effects are very large and @xmath24 decrease for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a small temperature - dependent resistance is observed at zero - bias , which is mainly due to temperature - induced phase diffusion  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the high frequency response of the cnt junctions is examined by voltage - current curves in the presence of rf - fields . </S>",
    "<S> figs . 3a and 4a show the appearance of constant voltage shapiro steps , which are due to the harmonical synchronization of the josephson oscillations and the applied rf excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the steps appear at voltages equal to @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a flux quanta . </S>",
    "<S> we checked this linear relation in the frequency range between @xmath30 = 1 to 15 ghz ( data not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the rf current @xmath31 on the shapiro steps is presented on figs . 3b and 4b for the on- and off - state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the plots show the differential resistance as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath22 , giving rise to a complicated pattern of non - dissipative lobes .    </S>",
    "<S> we modelled the data with a phenomenological description of time - dependent transport in superconducting junctions based on both the standard josephson relations and on classical circuit theory , the so - called resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this invokes simple differential equations that govern the dynamics of the phase @xmath32 across the junction :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the instantaneous voltage drop , @xmath35 the injected current with an oscillating part at the radiofrequency @xmath36 , @xmath37 the quasiparticle contribution to the current , @xmath1 the critical supercurrent , and @xmath38 the capacitance of the junction .    assuming an ohmic quasiparticle current @xmath39 and defining a basic frequency scale @xmath40 , one obtains two relevant dimensionless parameters in the analysis of the shapiro steps : i ) the reduced pulsation @xmath41 characterizing the shape of the shapiro steps  @xcite ( pure bessel functions are obtained in the limit @xmath42 only ) ; ii ) the quality factor @xmath43 that controls the damping of the phase dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are adjusted to the experimental data in the rf driven regime where the dynamics is less sensitive to phase diffusion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the experimental data in the on - state reveals a globally good agreement for @xmath44 , i.e. the rsj model with no capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the geometrical capacitance of cnt junctions is very small ( @xmath45 af ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is supported by the small hysteresis effects of the @xmath46-curves ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the predicted @xmath47 is very close to @xmath2 at @xmath31 = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the shapiro step positions present however small but appreciable deviations to the pure bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> their precise shape can indeed be more accurately described using a reduced pulsation @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a clear downward dispersion of the lobes is observed , which may be attributed to the non - ohmic character of the quasiparticle current @xmath37 above the threshold @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the phase dynamics with such non - linear rsj model , where the non - linear @xmath49 from the @xmath46-curves in the resistive state of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 was included , are provided in fig . 3c and compare favorably to the experimental data .    . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) @xmath20-maps versus @xmath22 and @xmath31 for @xmath30 = 4 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) simulation of the data in ( b ) using the non - linear rcsj model . ]    regarding the off - state , several issues point to additional underdamping effects : the @xmath46-curves are strongly hysteretic and the degree of hysteresis diminishes with increasing temperature ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the low - bias shapiro steps present a peculiar threshold behavior ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) , while the lobes show an upward dispersion . these properties </S>",
    "<S> can not be explained within the usual rcsj model , and may be only accounted for at a qualitative level by introducing a rather large effective capacitance @xmath50 ff and a non - linear quasiparticle resistance ( stronger than in the on - state discussed above ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c shows a partial agreement between our simulations and the data . </S>",
    "<S> the gate - dependence of @xmath38 suggests a diffusive cnt contact in the off - state , i.e. additional capacities coming from the cnt contacts . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for the off state , the electrode / nanotube capacitance has to be taken into account since the pd / nanotube contact is known to be distributed over a larger part of the contact  @xcite . its value can be rather strong ( @xmath51 1 ff ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the on - state however , the capacitance of the contact can be strongly renormalized by the tunnel effect  @xcite and the capacitance of the junction is mainly due to the nanotube self - capacitance estimated as 30 af for a nanotube portion of 200 nm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more thorough analysis of quantum and thermal fluctuation effects on the shapiro steps in the spirit of references  @xcite is clearly beyond the scope of the present study . </S>",
    "<S> we point out however that these effects probably do not account for the strong reduction of the critical current , as the above analysis demonstrated in the on - state .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the critical currents and the constant - voltage shapiro steps under rf irradiation of a strongly coupled cnt josephson junction , and discovered a strong gate - voltage dependence . </S>",
    "<S> these junctions are therefore very promising as tunable rf building blocks for superconducting devices .    </S>",
