    "recent years have seen a renewed interest in experimental tests of lorentz and cpt symmetry .",

    "the general realistic effective field theory for lorentz violation is called the standard - model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "it includes the standard model coupled to general relativity along with all possible operators for lorentz violation .",
    "both global @xcite and local @xcite lorentz violation are incorporated .",

    "each lorentz - violating term in the lagrange density of the sme is constructed as the coordinate - independent product of a coefficient for lorentz violation with a lorentz - violating operator .",
    "the lorentz - violating physics associated with any operator is therefore controlled by the corresponding coefficient , and so any experimental signal for lorentz violation can be expressed in terms of one or more of these coefficients .",
    "the lorentz - violating operators in the sme are systematically classified according to their mass dimension , and operators of arbitrarily large dimension can appear . at any fixed dimension , the operators are finite in number and can in principle be enumerated .",
    "a limiting case of particular interest is the minimal sme , which can be viewed as the restriction of the sme to include only lorentz - violating operators of mass dimension four or less .",
    "the corresponding coefficients for lorentz violation are dimensionless or have positive mass dimension .    the results summarized here concern primarily but not exclusively the coefficients for lorentz violation in the minimal sme .",
    "we compile data tables for these sme coefficients , including both existing experimental measurements and some theory - derived limits , and we provide tables listing some relevant definitions and properties .",
    "we also extract summary tables listing our best estimates for the maximal attained sensitivities in three sectors : ordinary matter ( electrons , protons , and neutrons ) , photons , and gravity .",

    ", tighter results may exist when suitable theoretical assumptions are adopted ; these results can be found in the data tables that follow .",
    "where observations involve a linear combination of coefficients in the tables , the displayed sensitivity for each coefficient assumes for definiteness that no other coefficient contributes .",
    "some caution is therefore advisable in applying the results in these summary tables to situations involving two or more nonzero coefficient values .",
    "care in applications is also required because under some circumstances certain coefficients can be intrinsically unobservable or can be absorbed into others by field or coordinate redefinitions .",
