    "one of the big challenges of contemporary physics is to obtain a working theory of quantum gravity .",
    "but even with such a theory in hand there could presumably remain questions of why the initial conditions of the gravitational field where what they were .",
    "such questions may even pertain to constants of nature and the like , in a theory of everything , including gravity .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look for ways in which the initial conditions can be specified in a _",
    "natural _ way .",
    "with this in mind , in the present article we study quantum brans - dicke theory @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "gravitational coupling and cosmological constant can be dynamical : with a non - trivial potential , one can typically find solutions of the classical equations in which the scalar @xmath0 carries out small oscillations around a minimum in the potential .",
    "such a minimum can then be thought of as determining a pair of effective constants @xmath1 .",
    "we note that a brans - dicke theory with potential can be obtained from string theory upon introduction of the dilaton field @xcite .",
    "the dilaton field is then related to coupling parameters of all interactions in string theory , and questions about the value of the gravitational coupling strength are thus connected to the _ dilaton stabilization problem _ ,",
    "i.e. , the problem to explain why the field value of the dilaton of our universe is located in such a stable location @xcite .",
    "this is a problem that has currently no commonly accepted answer .",
    "upon quantization of the theory , each quantum state gives probabilities for the values of @xmath0 , and these can , provided the state allows for a suitable classical interpretation , be translated into probabilities for effective constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such quantum states are obviously not unique , but there are proposals to single out a unique natural state .",
    "given such a proposal , one obtains an a priori probability distribution for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for the canonical formulation of quantum gravity , the no - boundary ( or hartle - hawking ) wave function @xmath4 @xcite is such a proposal for a natural initial state of the universe .. there is an extensive literature about and range of approaches to this question , but we will not address any of this here .",
    "rather , we will take a pragmatic approach , by just assuming that the extreme cases ( probabilities very large or small , similar or very different ) do tell us something about the kind of space times that are excluded , or , respectively , described by a specific model . ]",
    "probabilities for the values of coupling constants have been discussed in the context of quantum gravity for a long time .",
    "early works ( see for example @xcite ) rely on the fact that in the instanton approximation , the no - boundary wave - function is dominated by the euclidean de - sitter solution , whose action comes out proportional to @xmath5 , and argue that a vanishing cosmological constant is preferred by the resulting probabilities .",
    "a famous and detailed argument by coleman @xcite has @xmath6 where @xmath3 is to be interpreted as an effective constant that comprises contributions from a path integral over wormhole solutions , and the exponential of ( minus ) the effective action is to be interpreted as a probability distribution for @xmath3 .",
    "this result has also be interpreted as driving the gravitational coupling to zero @xcite .",
    "coleman s argument has been studied in the context of scalar - tensor theory @xcite , with the same result for @xmath3 , and the additional one that the whole theory would be driven toward the einstein gravity limit .    in the present work ,",
    "we are more moderate and more ambitious at the same time .",
    "we do not consider the sum over topologies , and thus the coupling constants in our action will not receive corrections . on the other hand , as described above , the scalar determines the gravitational coupling , and introducing a potential , we obtain dynamical vacuum energy . using the no - boundary wave function ,",
    "we obtain probability distributions for both .",
    "we work in the minisuperspace setting @xcite .",
    "this has been considered previously for brans - dicke theory , for example in @xcite . in @xcite various initial conditions for the wave function",
    "are studied in regards to the consequences for the effective cosmological constant , using a wkb approximation .",
    "the standard result of a minimal value for the cosmological constant is obtained for the tunneling proposal , but interestingly , not necessarily in the no - boundary proposal .",
    "what is new in our work is that we strive for a much better approximation to the no - boundary wave function .",
    "we follow @xcite in allowing fuzzy ( i.e. , complex - valued ) instantons to contribute to the approximation , and we also use numerics to determine the solutions in the fully dynamical regime . the classicality condition of @xcite also plays a pivotal role .    in section  [ sec : pre ] , we introduce the general procedure to obtain an approximation to the no - boundary measure : minisuperspace approximation , saddle point approximation of the no - boundary wave function , and imposition of classicality conditions . in section  [ sec :",
    "qua ] , we apply the method to scalar - tensor gravity , and describe the numerical algorithm that we use to find the relevant stationary points of the euclidean action . in section  [ sec : nbm ] , we report the results on the no - boundary measure for two types of potentials : quadratic potentials and double or multiple - well potential . finally , we will apply our results to the dilaton stabilization problem .",
    "we have also included analytic results wherever we could . in section",
    "[ sec : dis ] , we summarize and discuss our findings .",

    "but even after gauge - fixing , the integral is not convergent because the euclidean action is in general not positive .",

    "this generic algorithm finds the optimal parameter as the number of generations becomes sufficiently large .",
    "however , it is possible that there is no classical solution for a given @xmath155",
    ". therefore , we have to be careful whether the optimized value is really the classical solution or not .",
    "there are two main drawbacks of the generic algorithm in searching classical solutions .",
    "one is that it can converge to a local minimum of @xmath185 rather than the global minimum , or there can be two or more classical histories for a given @xmath155 . to resolve this problem",
    ", we divided the searching region of @xmath192 into several pieces and found the optimal parameters separately . in this way",
    ", one can reduce the possibility of being captured by a local minimum .",
    "the other drawback is that the result can sensitively depend on simulation parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath205 , @xmath197 , @xmath203 , and the definition of the objective function .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath205 , @xmath197 and @xmath203 should be sufficiently large until the result is not sensitively depend on the choice of them . in our choice of @xmath185 , we have to choose a proper time interval @xmath206 $ ] where we will regard that a history becomes classicalized around the time .",
    "therefore , we have to carefully choose the time interval case by case and check whether the results are not sensitively depend on the choice of parameters .",
    "in this section , we study the no - boundary measure for two types of potentials : quadratic potentials and the double - well / multiple - well potentials .",
    "the former is useful to obtain clues abut the physics the near a generic local minimum , the latter to compare the probabilities for various values of gravitational couplings in the case of the quadratic potential , we also have some analytic results that we can compare to the numerical ones .",
    "our results on these types of potentials will give some intuition for the dilaton stabilization problem .",
    "first , we will make some analytic considerations , then we will turn to the numerical investigation .",
    "for a first estimate , we regard that the potential is approximated near @xmath207 by @xmath208 after we re - define the field @xmath209 , the on - shell euclidean action becomes @xmath210 therefore , compared to the einstein case , we have an effective new term proportional to @xmath211 . the field equation is @xmath212 where we have defined @xmath213 .",
    "thus , for a quadratic potential the brans - dicke field equation is the same as that for a standard scalar coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "thus , as it was approximated by @xcite , we can compare the euclidean action to the slowly rolling and almost static field limit .    in the static case , where @xmath214 with @xmath169 determined by @xmath215 , we have the exact solution , @xmath216 where @xmath217v ' = \\frac{1}{6}v'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to satisfy no - boundary and classicality conditions , the turning point of the contour should be at @xmath218 .",
    "then the real part of the action does not grow after the turning point and the action becomes @xmath219 therefore , for small @xmath220 limit , the euclidean action negatively increases and hence @xmath221 will be preferred .",
    "let us go even a little further : we have found one exact solution fulfilling classicality , and it is a de sitter - like solution , i.e. trigonometric / exponential dependence of the scale factor in euclidean respectively lorentzian time .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to guess that other solutions contributing to the classical regime are perturbed de sitter like solutions . to obtain those ,",
    "we need a field configuration allowing an inflating space - time .",
    "the well - known mechanisms are slow - roll inflation and false vacuum inflation .",
    "we are therefore led to hypothesize that histories contributing to the classical regime are allowed under the following conditions :    1 .   a part of the potential satisfies the slow - roll conditions and the history experiences the region of the potential ( thus mimicking slow - roll inflation ) .",
    "2 .   the field becomes slowed - down and approaches a local maximum or minimum to experience an effectively de sitter space ( thus mimicking false vacuum inflation ) .",
    "the slow - roll conditions for einstein gravity are @xmath222 in terms of the brans - dicke potential , @xmath223 from this consideration , one is led to the following hypotheses : first , assuming the local extrema to be obtained for @xmath224 , both of the slow - roll conditions are difficult to satisfy , unless there is an inflection point . and @xmath3 is larger than @xmath225 ; however , a cosmological constant larger than @xmath225 , is unrealistic for our universe and we are not interested such a case . ]",
    "second , assuming @xmath226 for large @xmath0 , slow - roll conditions hold only if @xmath227 . therefore ,",
    "if the potential shape is `` runaway '' for large @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath228 , classicalization via slow - roll inflation may not happen . certainly , in both these cases , classical histories may still appear via false vacuum inflation .",
    "for the quadratic potential , the conditions are @xmath229 therefore , both of the conditions hold if and only if in the @xmath230 limit .",
    "this suggests that there are no classical histories that start near the bottom of the potential @xmath231 .",
    "such behavior has been observed numerically in the einstein case @xcite .",
    "it also suggests that the range of initial conditions that allow for classical histories gets larger as @xmath51 increases .",
    "both of these conclusions from our analytical considerations are borne out very well in the numerical results that we will present below .",
    "we have numerically determined the classical histories contributing to the no - boundary condition in the case of the quadratic potential .",
    "our algorithm converges well and finds a region of initial values for which there are classical histories . in this region",
    "one solution per initial value @xmath232 is found .",
    "this is in contrast to the einstein case , where there are two solutions due to the symmetry of the potential . under @xmath233 .",

    "other classical histories show similar characteristics , as we had already anticipated by analytical arguments .",
    "we also note that the solution becomes real in the large @xmath7 limit , as it should : it is instructive to compare the real part and the imaginary part ( top and middle of figure  [ fig : quadratic_field2 ] ) . after the turning point ( marked by the red circles )",
    ", the imaginary parts quickly decrease to zero and are in particular extremely small as compared to the real parts .",
    "also the behavior of the action ( bottom of figure  [ fig : quadratic_field2 ] ) is consistent with our expectations . during the euclidean time ,",
    "the real part of the euclidean action increases ( to the negative direction ) and variation of the imaginary part is negligible .",
    "however , after the turning point , the real part of the euclidean action is almost constant , while the imaginary part of the action increases ( to the negative direction ) .",
    "this shows that for large @xmath7 , the variation of the imaginary part of the action is much bigger than that of the real part , and hence the classicality condition holds for the solution .",

    "there is a critical @xmath155 so that there are no classical histories with initial value less than the critical one , which confirms our discussion using the slow roll conditions .",
    "as we decrease @xmath51 , classical histories can be observed in the small @xmath155 region .",
    "this is related to the effective mass @xmath213 .",
    "if the effective mass increases , or @xmath246 , then the field rolls more quickly than in the small effective mass cases , and hence it will be difficult to see a classical history near the minimum .",
    "the double - well potential has two minima for @xmath0 ; this is very important for the present work since it gives a simple model that allows two different universes with different gravitational couplings .",
    "after we gain intuition on the no - boundary measure in this case , we can apply it to the dilaton potential , by shifting one minimum to infinity .    a typical double - well potential in the jordan frame ( upper left ) , einstein frame ( upper right ) , and slow - roll conditions ( equation  ( [ eqn : sl ] ) , the second of them positive definite ) of the potential ( lower left ) , for @xmath247 , @xmath90 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 .",

    "let us consider a simple case @xmath251 and @xmath247 , @xmath90 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 .",
    "we plot the potential in the jordan frame @xmath53 ( upper left of figure  [ fig : potential_all ] ) , potential in the einstein frame @xmath252 ( upper right of figure  [ fig : potential_all ] ) , and both of slow - roll conditions ( lower left of figure  [ fig : potential_all ] ) .",
    "one can see that the slow - roll conditions never become sufficiently small at the same time .",
    "perhaps , if a saddle point and an inflection point coincide in the einstein frame , it may be possible to obtain a region where both slow - roll conditions hold .",
    "however , in this case the solution would not be stable and hence we will not consider this possibility further .",
    "however , even though slow - roll conditions do not hold , if initial conditions of the field are finely tuned so that if the field is slowed down and approaches a local extremum , there may be a possibility to see a classical history",
    ". one trivial example of this is the solution in equation  ( [ eq : exact ] ) .",
    "therefore , one may guess that such a real solution can happen near the solution of @xmath253 ( local minimum or local maximum of the potential in the einstein frame ) .",
    "however , if the solution is a minimum , this can not work .",
    "if the field does not start exactly at the minimum , it will roll to the upper region of the potential during the euclidean time evolution .",
    "only a local maximum is an attractor during euclidean time ( lower right of figure  [ fig : potential_all ] ) , and may thus provide for a continuum of classical histories via false vacuum inflation .",
    "thus there is some hope to see classical solutions    1 .   precisely at a local minimum , 2 .   precisely at a local maximum , and 3 .   for initial conditions",

    "now let us define subsets of all histories @xmath163 by imposing _ initial conditions _ : @xmath254 , @xmath255 , and @xmath256 , such that @xmath257 where @xmath258 is a local minimum , @xmath259 is a local maximum , and @xmath260 , @xmath261 are bounds to allow classical histories around the local maximum .",
    "we know that around the local minimum or maximum , the euclidean action will be approximately equation  ( [ eqn : ds ] ) , and hence @xmath262 where @xmath168 is given by the lebesgue in the space of initial conditions",

    "for the right - rolling case , since the final state has sufficient vacuum energy , one can see the exponentially increasing @xmath98 ; therefore , future evolutions of left - rolling and right - rolling cases are quite different .",

    "the allowed region for left - rolling solutions is @xmath278 and the allowed region for right - rolling solutions is approximately @xmath279 ( figure  [ fig : doublewell ] ) .",

    "now let us generalize for multiple - well cases .",
    "if we see a triple - well potential , then there are two places with non  zero measure where classical solutions can be obtained : let us call @xmath284 and @xmath285 ( figure  [ fig : multiplewell ] ) . then , there can be three final conditions : ends at the first minimum @xmath264 , ends at the second minimum @xmath265 , and ends at the third minimum @xmath286 .",

    "now we write probabilities by ( we ignore the prefactor @xmath291 ) , @xmath292 this argument can be generalized for other multiple - well potentials .",
    "let us think a typical dilaton - type potential ( figure  [ fig : dilaton ] ) .",
    "in many models of dilaton potential , there is an unstable direction in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "let us try to consider this as an extreme limit of a double - well potential , as in figure  [ fig : dilaton ] .",
    "let us call the minima @xmath293 and @xmath294 . as we have seen previously",
    ", histories in which @xmath0 is precisely located in one of the minima will lead to classical points of the no - boundary wave function with modulus squared proportional to @xmath295 .",
    "therefore , if we compare just these two points , the right minimum @xmath294 is much more preferred .",
    "we can think that a dilaton potential is an extreme limit of @xmath296 . in this point of view",
    ", euclidean quantum cosmology seems to say that the dilaton field should be destabilized and all coupling constants of nature should be zero .",
    "multiple - well potential . ]    a typical dilaton - type potential and an extension for a thought experiment . ]",
    "however , as we discussed in the previous section , other histories also contribute classical points , in particular the _ fuzzy instantons_. for the potential in figure  [ fig : dilaton ] , it is also difficult to find a region that allows slow - roll conditions to be satisfied , except inflection points",
    ". thus there can be classical solutions around the local minima or maxima ; those starting near but not precisely at the local minimum will evolve towards the maximum and obtain the main contribution to the euclidean action there .",
    "furthermore there will be continuously many classical histories starting around the local maximum of the potential .",
    "therefore , as in equations  ( [ eqn : psipsi1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : psipsi2 ] ) , the local minima will be excluded .    for obvious practical reasons",
    ", we can not directly work with the @xmath297 solution itself .",
    "numerically , we only see runaway solutions",
    ". however , as we numerically observed , all runaway solutions should experience false vacuum inflation around the local maximum , and hence the probability can not be @xmath298 .",
    "then , are the stable histories preferred ?",
    "we have to compare the left - rolling ( stable ) histories and the right - rolling ( unstable ) histories .",
    "as we discussed above , our numerical results and the understanding of the behavior of the histories contributing to the saddle point approximation that we have developed in the previous sections show that the probabilities for a classical universe with stabilized , and one with non - stabilized couplings should be of similar magnitude . at very least , it appears that the stabilized universe would not be exponentially suppresed , unless the potentially would somehow be extremely ( `` exponentially '' ) asymetric .    in conclusion , we can say on the dilaton stabilization problem using the no - boundary measure that :    1 .",
    "we _ disagree _ with the assertion that the probability of a universe corresponding to the runaway solution is @xmath225 .",
    "2 .   rather , under the approximation we are working in , probabilities for stabilization and de - stabilization are of similar order .",
    "therefore , the no - boundary proposal seems to be able to contribute to the solution of the dilaton stabilization problem .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the no - boundary measure in scalar - tensor gravity in the context of euclidean quantum cosmology .",
    "especially , we were interested in trying to explain why we see a non - vanishing gravitational coupling .",
    "this is related to the dilaton stabilization problem , to explain why the dilaton field is located in a stable vacuum of a potential .    to get a handle on this problem",
    ", we worked with a brans - dicke field with various potentials . as was found in previous work , we have seen that it is important to not only consider real field configurations in the saddle point approximation to the wave function , but also complex ones , the fuzzy instantons . in our case",
    ", we see that fuzzy instantons contributing to the probability for classical universes are allowed in the following two regions in a potential : with the scalar _ at _ a local minimum or _ near _ a local maximum .",
    "the instantons at the minimum is in fact not fuzzy , but they are of measure zero as compared to the other fuzzy instantons .",
    "therefore , even though the former have large negative euclidean action , their probability will be zero .",
    "thus , histories contributing to the probability for a classical universe should slow down and spend time around a local maximum , experience false - vacuum inflation , and then turn to lorentzian time .",
    "_ this is indeed a new classicalization mechanism _ that is different from the previous work of hartle , hawking , and hertog .",
    "the next question is whether we will roll - down to left or to right . in at the level of precision and approximation that we are working at , we can not decide .",
    "probabilities of two possibilities have similar order , unless the potential is extraordinarily asymmetric .",
    "therefore , the no - boundary measure can partly explain the stabilization of some coupling constants of nature .",
    "but it does not seem to assign probability zero universes in which they run away .",
    "this is perhaps a point where anthropic reasoning may be employed .",
    "there are some issues that we have not studied , but which may nevertheless be relevant to the questions we considered :    * in this work , we did not include volume weighting , since we did not include an inflaton field ( of course , the dilaton field can role as an inflaton field , but it may not necessarily be true ) .",
    "if we include the _ inflaton field _ , the classicalization process could be changed , since there is another field that induces inflation .",
    "the inclusion of volume weighting and/or an additional scalar may change the results . *",
    "if there is a correction term which affects histories near a local minimum so that it _ breaks symmetry _ around the local minimum , then the region near the local minimum could admit a continuous spectrum of histories . then",
    ", if vacuum energy of such a local minimum is sufficiently smaller than other positions , it may fully explain the stabilization of the dilaton field .",
    "* from our numerical results it seems that our intuition , coming from the dynamics of real fields , serves us well for the qualitative understanding of the dynamics of the fuzzy instantons .",
    "it should however be kept in mind that these are complex field configurations . in particular , they are sensitive to the analytic continuation of the potential .",
    "it is thus not inconceivable that different potentials , with a similar shape on the real sub - sector of the theory , will lead to different results .",
    "in addition , although our study is on scalar - tensor gravity , our conclusion is qualitatively relevant also for the no - boundary measure of einstein gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field . due to their choice of",
    "the potential , hartle , hawking and hertog @xcite only considered slow - roll inflation , concluded that the bottom - up probabilities do not favor larger amounts of inflation , and then appealed to volume weighting to deal with this problem @xcite .",
    "our work shows , however , that there is a second mechanism to generate classical histories , provided the potential has a more complex shape .",
    "they can be formed around the local maximum via false vacuum inflation . in this case",
    ", the bottom - up probability does not disfavor the top of the hill of the potential , and it may be possible to explain large amounts of inflation from bottom up probabilities in this way .",

    "<S> in this article , we study the no - boundary wave function in scalar - tensor gravity with various potentials for the non - minimally coupled scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to calculate probabilities for the scalar field  and hence the effective gravitational coupling and cosmological constant  to take specific values . </S>",
    "<S> most calculations are done in the minisuperspace approximation , and we use a saddle point approximation for the euclidean action , which is then evaluated numerically .    we find that for potentials that have several minima , none of them is substantially preferred by the quantum mechanical probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the same is true for the stable and the runaway solution in the case of a dilaton - type potential . </S>",
    "<S> technically , this is due to the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects ( fuzzy instantons ) .    these results are in contrast to the often held view that vanishing gravitation or cosmological constants would be exponentially preferred in quantum cosmology , and they may be relevant to the cosmological constant problem and the dilaton stabilization problem .    </S>",
