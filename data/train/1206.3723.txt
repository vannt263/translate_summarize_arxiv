    "in a seminal paper , goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1969 ) developed a dc circuit model for the magnetic interaction between jupiter and its satellite io ( see also piddington & drake 1968 ) . in this model , the orbital motion of io in the rotating magnetosphere of jupiter generates electromotive force ( emf ) , driving a dc current between io and jupiter , with the closed magnetic field lines serving as wires .",
    "in essence , the jupiter - io system operates as a unipolar inductor .",
    "this model helped to explain jupiter s decametric radio emissions which are correlated with the motion of io and the hot spot in jupiter s atmosphere that is linked magnetically to io ( e.g. , clarke et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in recent years",
    ", the dc circuit model of goldreich & lynden - bell has been adapted and applied to other types of astrophysical binary systems , including ( i ) planets around magnetic white dwarfs ( li et al .",
    "1998 ) ; ( ii ) ultra - compact white dwarf binaries with periods ranging from a few minutes to a hour ( wu et al . 2002 ; dallosso et al .",
    "2006,2007 ) ; ( iii ) coalescing neutron star - black hole binaries and neutron star - neutron star binaries prior to the final merger ( mcwilliams & levin 2011 ; piro 2012 ; see also vietri 1996 , hansen & lyutikov 2001 and lyutikov 2011 for more general discussion of unipolar induction in such binaries ) ; ( iv ) exoplanetary systems containing short - period ( @xmath1 days ) planets orbiting magnetic ms stars ( laine & lin 2012 ) ;    in the dc circuit model , the magnetic interaction torque and the related energy dissipation rate are inversely proportional to the total resistance @xmath2 of the circuit , including contributions from the two binary components and the magnetosphere .",
    "thus it seems that extreme power may be produced for highly conducting binary systems .",
    "however , we show in this paper that when @xmath2 is smaller than a critical value ( @xmath3  ohms , where @xmath4 is the orbital velocity as seen in the rotating frame of the magnetic star ) , the large current flowing in the circuit will break the magnetic connection between the binary components .",
    "thus there exists an upper limit to the magnetic torque and the energy dissipation rate . in sects .  2 - 4",
    ", we examine the general aspect of the dc circuit model , the upper limit and its connection with `` open circuit '' effect ( `` alfven radiation '' ) .",
    "we then discuss applications of the model to various astrophysical binaries in sects .  5 - 8 and conclude in sect .",
    "consider a binary system consisting of a magnetic star ( the `` primary '' , with mass @xmath5 , radius @xmath6 , spin @xmath7 , and magnetic dipole moment @xmath8 ) and a non - magnetic companion ( mass @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 ) . the orbital separation is @xmath11 , and the orbital angular frequency is @xmath12 .",
    "the magnetic field strength at the surface of the primary is @xmath13 .",
    "the whole binary system is embedded in a tenuous plasma ( magnetosphere ) . for simplicity , we assume @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are all aligned .",
    "dc circuit model of magnetic interactions in binary systems _ a la _ goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1969).,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.7 cm    the motion of the non - magnetic companion relative to the magnetic field of the primary produces an emf @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this gives , [ eq : emf]where @xmath21 .",
    "the emf drives a current along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , connecting the primary and the companion through two flux tubes ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the current in the circuit is = _ tot , where the total resistance of the circuit is _",
    "tot=_+_c+2_mag , with @xmath22 the resistances of the magnetic star , the companion and the magnetosphere , respectively .",
    "the energy dissipation rate of the system is then e_diss=2i^2r_tot=2 ^ 2_tot , [ eq : diss]where the factor of 2 accounts for both the upper and lower sides of the circuit .",
    "note that because of the finite resistances @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the magnetic flux tube in general rotates at a rate @xmath25 between @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "the slippage of the companion relative to the magnetic field gives @xmath26 .",
    "the slippage of the primary s rotation relate to the flux tube generates @xmath27 at the magnetic foot on the surface of the primary .",
    "the total emf @xmath28 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emf ] ) , independent of @xmath25 .    the total magnetic force ( in the azimuthal direction ) on the companion is @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "thus the torque acting on the binary s orbital angular momentum is t = j_orbar_cib_z-4r_cca^2_tot .",
    "the torque on the primary is @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the moment of inertia ) .",
    "the orbital energy loss rate associated with @xmath33 is then e_orb = t-2 ^ 2_tot .",
    "the total energy dissipation rate of the system is e_diss=(-e_orb)- i__s_s = -t=2 ^ 2_tot , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : diss ] ) .",
    "the equations in the previous section clearly show that the binary interaction torque and energy dissipation associated with the dc circuit increase with decreasing total resistance @xmath2 .",
    "is there a problem for the dc model when @xmath2 is too small ?",
    "the answer is yes .    the current in the circuit produces toroidal magnetic field , which has the same magnitude but opposite direction above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "the toroidal field just above the companion star ( in the upper flux tube ) is @xmath34 , where the ( height - integrated ) surface current in the companion is @xmath35 .",
    "thus the azimuthal twist of the flux tube is _",
    "= -b_+b_z=8cr_c_tot|b_z| = 16 v_relc^2_tot , [ eq : zeta]where @xmath36 is the orbital velocity in the corotating frame of the primary star . clearly ,",
    "when @xmath2 is less than @xmath37 , the flux tube will be highly twisted .",
    "gl already speculated in 1969 that the dc circuit would break down when the twist is too large .",
    "( for the jupiter - io system parameters adopted by gl , the twist @xmath38 . )",
    "since then , numerous works have confirmed that this is indeed the case .",
    "theoretical studies and numerical simulations , usually carried out in the contexts of solar flares and accretion disks , have shown that as a flux tube is twisted beyond @xmath39 , the magnetic pressure associated with @xmath40 makes the flux tube expand outward and the magnetic fields open up , allowing the system to reach a lower energy state ( e.g. , aly 1985 ; aly & kuijpers 1990 ; van ballegooijen 1994 ; lynden - bell & boily 1994 ; lovelace et al .",
    "1995 ; uzdensky et al .",
    "thus , a dc circuit with @xmath39 can not be realized : the flux tube will break up , disconnecting the linkage between the two binary components .",
    "a binary system with @xmath41 can not establish a steady - state dc circuit .",
    "the electrodynamics is likely rather complex .",
    "at best we can expect a quasi - cyclic circuit , involving several steps : ( a ) the magnetic field from the primary penetrates part of the companion , establishing magnetic linkage between the two stars ; ( b ) the linked fields are twisted by differential rotation , generating toroidal field from the linked poloidal field ; ( c ) as the toroidal magnetic field becomes comparable to the poloidal field , the fields inflate and the flux tube breaks , disrupting the magnetic linkage ; ( d ) reconnection between the inflated field lines relaxes the shear and restore the linkage . the whole cycle repeats .    in any case",
    ", we can use the dimensionless azimuthal twist @xmath42 to parameterize the magnetic torque and energy dissipation rate : & & t= -_,[eq : tmax ] + & & e_diss = -t = _ .",
    "[ eq : emax]the maximum torque and dissipation are obtained by setting @xmath43 . note that in the above , @xmath33 is negative since we are assuming @xmath44 .",
    "a reasonable extension would let @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "as discussed in gl , the validity of the dc circuit model requires that the slippage of the flux tube relative to the companion during the round - trip alfven travel time ( @xmath47 ) along the flux tube be much less than @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath48 . when this condition is not satisfied or when the poloidal field opens up , the disturbance generated by the companion s orbital motion @xmath49 will propagate along the field line as alfven waves and radiate away ( drell , foley & ruderman 1965 ) . the alfven radiation power associated with the `` open circuit '' is e_alf~14(b_z v_rel / v_a)^2v_a ( 2r_c^2 ) = 12b_z^2r_c^2v_rel^2v_a , where @xmath50 is the alfven speed in the magnetosphere ( assuming @xmath51 ) .",
    "the associated drag force is simply @xmath52 , and the torque on the orbit is t_alf~ -12b_z^2r_c^2av_relv_a . comparing @xmath53 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax ] ) , we find ~v_rel_v_a .",
    "[ eq : ealf]thus , @xmath53 is always smaller than the maximum @xmath54 of a dc circuit . equation  ( [ eq : emax ] ) ( with @xmath43 ) represents the maximum magnetic dissipation rate of the binary system , regardless of the details of the electrodynamics .",
    "gravitational wave ( gw ) emission drives the orbital decay of the neutron star ( ns ) binary , with timescale t_gw = a|a|=5c^5a^464g^3m_^3 q(1+q ) 0.012()^4s , [ eq : tgw]where in last equality we have adopted @xmath55 and mass ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the magnetic torque tends to spin up the primary when @xmath44 .",
    "spin - orbit synchronization is possible only if the synchronization time @xmath57 is less than @xmath58 at some orbital radii . with @xmath59 and the torque ( [ eq : tmax ] ) , we find t_syn&=&2(1+q ) _ ( ) ( ) ^2 + & & 210 ^ 7_^-1 ( ) ^-2(a30km)^7/2s , [ eq : tsyn]where in the second line we have adopted @xmath60 and @xmath61  km .",
    "clearly , even with magnetar - like field strength ( @xmath62  g ) and maximum efficiency ( @xmath43 ) , spin - orbit synchronization can not be achieved by magnetic torque .",
    "[ it was already known that tidal torque , due to both equilibrium tide ( bildsten & cutler 1992 ) and resonant tides ( lai 1994 ) , can not synchronize the ns spin during binary inspiral . ]    for the same reason , the effect of magnetic torque on the number of gw cycles during binary inspiral , @xmath63 , is small .",

    "with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tgw])-([eq : tsyn ] ) , we see that gw phase error @xmath66 is much less than unity even for @xmath62  g and maximum @xmath43 .",

    "some fraction of this dissipation will emerge as electromagnetic radiation counterpart of binary inspiral . whether it is detectable at extragalactic distance depends on the microphysics in the magnetosphere , including particle acceleration and radiation mechanism ( e.g. , vietri 1996 ; hansen & lyutikov 2001 ) .",
    "piro ( 2012 ) recently applied the dc circuit model to ns binaries . in the case",
    "when the magnetic ns primary dominates the total resistance , he found that the magnetic torque synchronizes the ns spin prior to merger and significantly affects the gravitational wave cycles , even for modest ( @xmath71  g ) ns magnetic fields . using the resistance computed by piro",

    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) that the corresponding azimuthal twist @xmath42 is much larger ( by a factor @xmath72 at @xmath73  s@xmath74 ) than unity , violating the upper limit discussed in sect .  3 .",
    "if one assumes that the magnetosphere resistance is given by the impedance of free space , @xmath75 , then the corresponding twist is @xmath76 , which satisfies our upper limit .",

    "note that @xmath85  g@xmath86 corresponds to @xmath87  mg ( for @xmath88  km ) , approaching the field strengths of intermediate polars .",

    "laine & lin ( 2012 ) recently applied the dc circuit model to study the interaction of close - in planets with the magnetosphere of host stars . from their calculation of the resistances of the planet , host star and magnetosphere",

    "( [ eq : tmax ] ) to a planetary system ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , we find that the magnetic torque induces orbital decay ( assuming @xmath44 , as is the case for close - in planets in a few day orbit ) at the rate = -_^2 r_p^2a^5m_p(gm_a)^1/2 .",
