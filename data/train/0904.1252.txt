    "in @xmath3 reactions , an isospin zero @xmath4 resonance at about 1870 mev in the @xmath5 channel was reported by the crystal ball collaboration and the cello collaboration@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the crystal ball collaboration presented a more detailed analysis of this resonance and its mass and width are determined to be about 1881 mev and 221 mev , respectively@xcite . in @xmath6 annihilation ,",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration reported an isospin zero @xmath4 resonance with a mass of about 1875 mev and a width of about 200 mev in the @xmath7 channel@xcite .",
    "in radiative @xmath8 decays , the bes collaboration reported a definite @xmath4 signal with a mass of about 1840 mev and a width of about 170 mev in the @xmath5 channel@xcite . in central production ,",
    "a similar @xmath4 resonance was observed by the wa102 collaboration in the @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath10 channels@xcite . using high statistics data on @xmath11 , anisovich et al .",
    "confirmed the presence of an isospin zero @xmath4 resonance with a mass of about 1860 mev and a width of about 250 mev in the @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath10 channels@xcite .",
    "it has been established that these observations in different experiments refer to a single state @xmath0@xcite , although this state is stated to need confirmation@xcite .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath0 are quoted to be @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev , respectively@xcite .    with the @xmath14 as the well - established @xmath15 @xmath2 state@xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 looks like either a @xmath15 @xmath16 [ @xmath17 or a @xmath18 hybrid [ @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) based on its mass , because the observed mass of the @xmath0 just overlaps the godfrey - isgur quark model prediction of 1.89 gev for the @xmath21@xcite and the flux - tube model prediction of @xmath22 gev for the @xmath23@xcite . of course the strong @xmath9 and @xmath7 modes",
    "are not expected from @xmath16 and hence may imply large @xmath24 flavor mixing in the @xmath0 if the @xmath0 is indeed a @xmath15 @xmath2 state .",
    "the near degeneracy of the @xmath14 and @xmath25 suggests the ideal mixing in the @xmath15 meson nonet , which disfavors the large flavor mixing in the @xmath0 qualitatively .",
    "also , the calculations from the @xmath26 model quantitatively argue against assigning the @xmath0 to the @xmath15 @xmath27 mixed quark model state@xcite .",
    "a feature of @xmath6 annihilation is that the well - known @xmath16 state such as the @xmath28 are produced very weakly , if at all@xcite ; the @xmath0 , in contrast , is produced strongly , which makes the @xmath21 interpretation for the @xmath0 unlikely . therefore , both the decay modes and production information for the @xmath0 do not favor it being the @xmath21 .",
    "apart from the @xmath0 mass , it dominantly decaying to the @xmath9 and @xmath7 is also in accord with the flux - tube model expectation for the @xmath23 where the preferred decay channels are to @xmath29-wave pairs@xcite .",
    "in addition , the discovery of the @xmath30 in @xmath6 annihilation@xcite to some extent leaves the @xmath0 as an ` extra ' , i.e. , non-@xmath2 state@xcite since the @xmath30 looks like a natural candidate for the @xmath14 s first radial excitation from its mass which is close to the godfrey - isgur quark model prediction of 2.13 gev@xcite for the @xmath1 @xmath18 state [ @xmath31 .",
    "so , the hybrid interpretation for the @xmath0 becomes a popular opinion@xcite .",
    "apart from the @xmath0 , its companion @xmath32 was also regarded to be a viable non - exotic hybrid candidate@xcite .",
    "although the hybrid interpretation for the @xmath32 and @xmath0 has several attractive features , it is necessary to exhaust their possible conventional @xmath2 descriptions before resorting to more exotic interpretations .",
    "in fact , the observation of the @xmath32 in the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 @xmath35-wave channels strongly casts doubt over the hybrid interpretation for the @xmath32 since the @xmath33 is expected to vanish and the @xmath34 @xmath35-wave is strongly suppressed for the hybrid@xcite . in our previous work@xcite , we argued that the experimental evidence for the @xmath32 is consistent with it being the conventional @xmath1 meson rather than the @xmath4 light hybrid by investigating its strong decay properties .",
    "if the @xmath32 can be described as the ordinary @xmath1 meson , one natural question is whether its companion @xmath0 could also be the ordinary @xmath1 meson or not . in this work",
    ", we shall discuss the possibility of the @xmath0 being the @xmath36 from its mass , production , total width , and strong decay pattern .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sections 2 - 3",
    ", we discuss the mass and production properties of the @xmath0 . in sect .",
    "4 , after a brief review of the @xmath26 model and the flux - tube model used in this work , we present the partial decay widths of the @xmath0 as the @xmath36 within these two models .",
    "the discussions and conclusion are given in sections 5 - 6 , respectively .",
    "godfrey - isgur quark model predicted that the @xmath36 mass is about 2.13 gev@xcite , about 250 mev higher than the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the @xmath0 therefore appears too light to be the @xmath36 at first glance .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 , both about 100 - 200 mev lower in mass than the godfrey - isgur quark model anticipated@xcite , turn out the excellent candidates for radial excitations@xcite , which indicates that godfrey - isgur quark model maybe overestimates the masses of the higher-@xmath39 radially excited mesons by about 100 - 200 mev@xcite .",
    "so the @xmath36 with a mass about 1.9 gev is presumably not implausible .",
    "also , the isovector state should act as a beacon for the mass scale of a meson nonet .",
    "if the @xmath32 can be identified as the isovector member of the @xmath1 @xmath2 nonet@xcite , the @xmath40 would be the orthogonal partner of the @xmath32 and one can naturally expect that the @xmath36 degenerates with the @xmath32 in effective quark masses .",
    "the similar behavior also exists in the established @xmath15 and @xmath41 meson nonets@xcite .",
    "recently , different approaches already consistently suggested that the @xmath42 has a mass of about 1.9 gev , close to the @xmath0 mass .",
    "for example , the vijande - fernandez - valcarce quark model predicted @xmath43 = 1.863 gev@xcite , the spectrum integral equation expected @xmath43 = 1.937 gev@xcite , and the mezoir - gonzalez quark model found @xmath43 = 1.913 gev@xcite .",
    "therefore , the assignment of the @xmath0 as the @xmath36 does not appear to be irrational based on its mass .",
    "for central production , close and kirk have found a kinematic filter that seems to suppress the well - established @xmath2 states when they are in @xmath44 and higher waves@xcite .",
    "its essence is that the pattern of resonances produced in the central production process depends on @xmath45 , the vector difference of the transverse momentum recoil of the final state protons .",
    "it has been illustrated in several channels that for @xmath46 large the @xmath2 states are prominent whereas for @xmath46 small all the undisputed @xmath2 states are suppressed while the enigmatic states probably having more complex structures such as the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 survive@xcite .",
    "the application of this kinematic filter to the centrally produced @xmath50 system , where the @xmath51 and @xmath52 have the same behavior as a function of the @xmath46 , successfully established the @xmath52 as the @xmath53 @xmath2 states@xcite . at one time",
    ", the @xmath52 was interpreted as either a hybrid@xcite , a four quark state@xcite , or a @xmath54 molecule@xcite .    in central production both the @xmath14 and the @xmath0",
    "were clearly observed , furthermore they exhibit the same behavior as a function of the @xmath46 , appearing sharply when @xmath55 gev , and vanishing as @xmath56 gev @xcite ( see table 2 of ref.@xcite and table 2 of ref.@xcite ) , as do other well - established @xmath2 states such as the @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the @xmath0 has the same dynamical structure as the @xmath14 , namely the standard @xmath4 @xmath2 . as mentioned above",
    ", the production in @xmath6 annihilation process argues against the @xmath16 interpretation of the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , with the @xmath14 as the well - established @xmath15 @xmath18 state , the production properties of the @xmath0 are consistent with it being the @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath26 model and the flux - tube model which are the standard models for strong decays at least for mesons in the initial state , have been widely used to evaluate the strong decays of hadrons@xcite , since they give a good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of the hadrons .",
    "below , we shall give the brief review of the two models employed in this work .",
    "the @xmath26 model , also known as the quark - pair creation model , was originally introduced by micu@xcite and further developed by le yaouanc et al.@xcite .",
    "the main assumption of the @xmath26 model of meson decay is that strong decays take place via the creation of a @xmath26 quark - antiquark pair from the vacuum .",
    "the newly produced quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath58 ) , together with the @xmath59 within the initial meson , regroups into two outgoing mesons in all possible quark rearrangement ways , which corresponds to the two decay diagrams as shown in fig.1 for the meson decay process @xmath60 .",
    "the transition operator @xmath61 of the decay @xmath62 in the @xmath26 model is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a dimensionless parameter representing the probability of the quark - antiquark pair @xmath58 with @xmath65 creation from the vacuum , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the momenta of the created quark @xmath68 and antiquark @xmath69 , respectively .",
