    "modern astronomers first recognized dark nebulae as regions of star formation in the late nineteenth century .",
    "molecular line studies ( e.g. , myers & benson 1983 ) showed that these dark nebulae contained copious amounts of cold material .",

    "the only starless core observed so far is l1014 , which presented a surprise .",
    "spitzer s observations reveal an infrared point source in this supposedly `` starless '' core . _",
    "l1014 is a lynds opacity class 6 dark cloud ( lynds 1962 ) that was undetected by both iras and msx .",
    "visser et al . ( 2002 ) observed this core with the submillimetre common users bolometer array ( scuba ) , and concluded that l1014 is a starless core based on two criteria : 1 ) it was not detected by iras and 2 ) they could not find evidence for an outflow .",
    "while most authors have assumed a distance of 200 pc to l1014 , there is no firm evidence for this distance .",
    "the lack of foreground stars indicates that it must be closer than 1 kpc . because it lies in the plane ( @xmath3 ) near the cygnus arm , distance estimates to these sources are unreliable .",
    "we adopt a distance of 200 pc for l1014 , but we discuss the consequences of larger distances .",
    "for l1014 , we present several new observations .",
    "first , we used spitzer s infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) to observe this core at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 @xmath0 m ( fazio et al .",

    "the two closest , bright , bluer sources are seen in 2mass ; the brighter of the two is saturated in some of the irac bands .",

    "brand & blitz ( 1993 ) assigned a distance of 2.6 kpc to an hii region , s124 , whose associated molecular cloud has @xmath34 km s@xmath23 ; s124 is offset from l1014-irs by ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this velocity component was not seen in our observations of hcn ( 1@xmath200 ) and cs ( 2@xmath201 ) . because no foreground stars are observed within @xmath11  of the core s center",
    ", the dark cloud as seen in the dss image can not be at 2.6 kpc , so it must be associated with the 4 km s@xmath23 component .",

    "in an attempt to understand the physical state of l1014 , we have used the data to create a working model .",
    "we used the scuba 850 @xmath0 m data to determine the density profile by matching our models with the observed intensity profile at 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "we have used a 1-dimensional radiative transfer package , _ dusty  ( ivezi et al . 1999 ) , to calculate the temperature profile and the observed sed ; _ obssphere  ( shirley et al . 2002 ) was used to simulate the scuba observations , including the effects of chopping .",
    "we used the dust opacities of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) , which represent grains with thin ice mantles ( oh5 dust ) and are appropriate for cold , dense cores ( e.g. , evans et al . 2001 ) . _",
    "_    the core is heated internally by a protostar and externally by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) . the isrf has been attenuated with dust whose properties are given by draine & lee ( 1984 ) with @xmath37=0.5 . both a shallow power - law ( @xmath38 ) and a bonnor - ebert ( be ) sphere were found to provide good fits to the observed 850 @xmath0 m brightness profile , in agreement with results from other `` starless '' cores ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "because it offers a good fit to the density structure , we use the analytical approximation given by tafalla et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for an isothermal be sphere , @xmath39 and found a good fit for @xmath40 @xmath41 ; for this central density , a be sphere is approximated with @xmath42 au and @xmath43 .",
    "we used inner and outer radii of 50 and 15000 au , respectively , but these are poorly constrained .",
    "this core has a mass of 1.7 m@xmath2 .",
    "the long - wavelength dust continuum emission shows that a cold , dense core is present and external heating can explain the emission longward of 70 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity for l1014-irs is 0.3 l@xmath2 , typical of starless cores heated only by the isrf ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ) . in these respects , l1014 looks like a core with no significant internal heating .",
    "the irac and mips data trace the sed of a considerably warmer source .",
    "the starless core model underestimates the 70  flux by a factor of 50 and can not begin to explain the data at shorter wavelengths .",
    "given the parameters above , we find that a source with luminosity of 0.025 l@xmath2 and @xmath44 k best fits the irac data ( as seen in figure  [ sed ] ) .    to match the 24 and 70 @xmath0 m points , a cooler component with substantially more surface area , such as a disk , is required .",
    "we use a simple model ( butner et al .",
    "1994 ; adams et al 1988 ) to simulate the disk emission .",
    "the disk has a total mass ( gas & dust ) of @xmath45 m@xmath2 , and a temperature profile , @xmath46 , simulating the effects of accretion onto the disk surface .",
    "@xmath47 , the outer radius of the disk , is set to 50 au , the smallest disk that matches the 70  data ; larger values for @xmath47 and the mass are possible .    the disk model that fits is passively heated by the central protostar and is itself luminous , possibly from accretion directly onto the disk .",
    "the partition of luminosity between the star and disk is not well constrained , so we use 0.09 l@xmath2 for the total luminosity of a central source in further discussion . future observations with millimeter and submillimeter",
    "interferometers are needed to constrain the value of @xmath47 and hence mass ; this model , with @xmath48 au , predicts a flux of 4.3 mjy at 850 @xmath0 m .    if this model is correct , we are observing a very low - mass protostar ( or proto - brown dwarf ) . assuming spherical accretion at a rate of @xmath49 m@xmath2 yr@xmath23 (",
    "as expected for a 10 k collapsing , isothermal sphere ) onto a star with a radius of 3 r@xmath2 and a mass of 0.1 m@xmath50 , the luminosity would be 1.8 l@xmath50 , 20 times what the observations permit . if we consider accretion rates appropriate for the be or `` plummer - like '' sphere ( e.g. , @xmath51 m@xmath2 yr@xmath23 ) as in whitworth & ward - thompson ( 2001 ) , the disparity between the predicted and observed luminosity is greatly amplified .",
    "kenyon and hartmann ( 1995 ) suggested that protostars may appear sub - luminous if accretion occurs toward the edge of a circumstellar disk .",
    "as the disk becomes too massive , the system will undergo an fu ori - type event where material accretes onto the star in a short burst .",
    "maybe , we see l1014-irs during a quiescent time when material is accreting and collecting in the disk . nonetheless , this is not an ordinary , accreting pre - main - sequence star .",
    "unless accretion is much less or the radius much larger , the mass of the central object is possibly substellar .",
    "these conclusions depend on the distance , which is uncertain .",
    "roughly , the core mass and central luminosity scale as @xmath52 . for 400 pc , the values would be 6.8 m@xmath2 and 0.36 l@xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the geometry might vary from the 1-dimensional core model studied in this paper .",
    "we have created a simple 2-dimensional model that includes a completely evacuated outflow cavity with a 30@xmath11 opening angle and an internal source as already described . using _",
    "radmc  ( dullemond & dominik , 2004 ) , we have calculated the sed for this model and found that , unless you look into the outflow cavity , the sed does not change by more than 10% .",
    "another possible alternative is that l1014-irs is a background protostar in the @xmath22 km s@xmath23 cloud at 2.6 kpc .",
    "models were calculated for an embedded protostar at this distance obscured by a foreground cloud ; the emergent sed for this model is shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "this was calculated in two steps in _ dusty , first calculating the emerging spectrum of the protostar and then illuminating a 10 k planar slab of an @xmath53 with this spectrum .",
    "the protostellar envelope was assumed to be free - falling ( @xmath54 , and the isrf was ignored .",
    "the modeled protostar had @xmath55 l@xmath2 and was surrounded by a 0.6 m@xmath2 envelope but no disk .",
    "the infrared source could be a typical protostar at a larger distance .",
    "we find this scenario to be statistically unlikely for several reasons .",
    "first , the lack of cs and hcn emission from the @xmath22 km s@xmath23 component and the fact that the co and @xmath21co emission do not peak at this position argue against this scenario .",
    "second , a map of cs ( 2@xmath201 ) at fcrao with a 50  beam shows that the 4 km s@xmath23 component has peak emission within one beam of l1014-irs , further supporting our nearby distance ( de vries et al . in prep . ) .",
    "finally , at 70 @xmath0 m , l1014-irs was the only source of emission within our field ; the 24 @xmath0 m flux for this source was the largest within the mips field for l1014 .",
    "such bright , infrared objects are uncommon , so a chance alignment between a background protostar and a foreground starless core is unlikely . _ _",
    "we have presented one of the most comprehensive sets of continuum data for a `` starless '' core since their discovery .",
    "these data span wavelengths from 2.17 to 1200 @xmath0 m and include spatially resolved maps of the millimeter emission from l1014-irs . from these data , we conclude that this core , previously thought to be starless , does harbor a central object . assuming a distance of 200 pc , we have created a model for this object that includes a 1.7 m@xmath2 envelope heated externally by the isrf .",
    "this core contains a central object with low luminosity ( @xmath56 l@xmath50 ) .",
    "this central source must have `` stellar '' and disk - like components in order to match the 3.6 to 70  photometry .",
    "this object appears to be substellar , though there is enough envelope mass to grow a star if a substantial fraction accretes .",
    "we have considered an alternate scenario , in which a distant , more luminous , but less embedded , protostar lies behind the core of the l1014 dark cloud .",
    "this scenario is unlikely but can not be ruled out conclusively without further observations .    assuming that the infrared source lies in the l1014 cloud , there are two significant conclusions .",
    "first , cores thought to be starless may harbor central objects .",
    "if this phenomenon is common , estimates for timescales for the evolution of starless cores will need revision .",
    "second , for plausible distances , this source has a very low luminosity .",
    "the usual assumptions about accretion rates and pre - main - sequence masses and radii produce far more luminosity than is seen .",
    "this object currently appears to be substellar , though it is likely to accrete more mass .",
