    "we note that in general , a morphism of real algebraic curves @xmath181 , inducing a covering map on real points , may have trivial _ real _ monodromy but be algebraically nontrivial ( i.e. , not be a local isomorphism ) . corollary [ cor : w = id ] shows that this can not occur for schubert curves .",
    "it is considerably easier to analyze the orbit structure of @xmath2 , and , therefore , the geometric structure of the schubert curve , using @xmath69 . as examples , we give two families of triples @xmath182 for which the schubert curve @xmath178 exhibits ` extremal ' numerical and geometrical properties .",
