    "note that the estimated ordered moment size of 0.2  @xmath64 per os@xmath9 is consistent with similar moment sizes seen in other double perovskite antiferromagnets such as ba@xmath0naoso@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for such small ordered moments , essentially undetectable to neutron powder diffraction , @xmath10sr provides nearly the only means of measurement .",
    "in particular , magnetic bragg peaks are expected to scale quadratically with the ordered moment size ; an ordered moment of 0.2  @xmath64 would yield a bragg peak 12 times smaller than the 0.7  @xmath64 upper limit derived from 63  hr of neutron data .",
    "it is also intriguing that both ba@xmath0yruo@xmath1 and ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 exhibit significantly higher frustration indices @xmath29 than ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 , indicating an increased level of frustration in the former materials .",
    "this is particularly intriguing in the case of the rhenate since in addition to being identical in structure , re@xmath14 and os@xmath9 are isoelectronic and , being neighbors on the periodic table , should have a very similar spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath27 , which scales as @xmath86 .",
    "recently , a mean field theory of ordered cubic double perovskites based on @xmath8 ions under strong soc has been published @xcite .",
    "a rather complex phase diagram is found with seven potential ground states which is reproduced as figure 11 .",
    "the y - axis depicts j/j , where j is a nearest - neighbor fm interaction scaled to a j = 1 afm nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the x - axis depicts v / j , which is the similarly normalized quadrupolar interaction defined as    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the quadrupole moment and @xmath2 is the unit cell constant .",
    "this is a repulsive term involving @xmath16 orbitals on nearest - neighbor sites and @xmath88 increases as a function of the degree of `` hybridization '' of oxygen @xmath89- and metal @xmath16-orbitals .",
    "of the seven states , three are ferromagnetic : fm110 , fm111 and * .",
    "there are also three antiferromagnetic states : afm100 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ; the latter two represent complex four - sublattice structures . the final state is a quadrupolar state , also described as a `` spin nematic '' , which does not break time reversal symmetry .",
    "calculated phase diagram of @xmath8 double perovskites exhibiting spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , under the model hamiltonian h = h@xmath92 + h@xmath93 + h@xmath94 .",

    "@xcite ; copyright ( 2011 ) by the american physical society.,width=321 ]    it is of interest of course to determine the relative placement of ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 and ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 within this diagram , @xmath95 , with respect to the j/j and v / j axes . comparing the curie - weiss temperatures , both are strongly negative but @xmath65@xmath96/ @xmath65@xmath97 @xmath12 4 , indicating that j/j@xmath98 @xmath18 j/j@xmath99 . to determine the relative v / j positions , the re@xmath7o and os@xmath7o distances should reflect the degree of hybridization with oxygen .",
    "these are 1.955(1 )   and 1.919(2 )  , respectively , indicating a larger v / j for the ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 phase . with the present work and previous heat capacity studies @xcite the ground state of the caos material",
    "is well established as afm and limits can be placed on the magnitude of the ordered os@xmath9 moment using both neutron diffraction and @xmath10sr results .",
    "unfortunately , the type of afm order can not yet be determined due to the very small ordered moment .",
    "ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 is thus described by the small j/j part of figure 11 , and the likely choices are afm100 , @xmath90 or @xmath91 , the latter two being complex four - sublattice states .",
    "there is one further important result from ref .",
    "@xcite which can guide this choice .",
    "the calculations were also carried out for @xmath4 @xmath5 0 and thus include predictions concerning the nature of the phase transitions from the high temperature paramagnetic state to any of the @xmath4 = 0 phases of fig .",
    "the transitions to @xmath90 and @xmath91 are found to be continuous while that to afm100 is strongly first order .",
    "the @xmath10sr data of fig . 8 indicate a continuous transition for ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 and thus there is a strong argument for either the @xmath90 or @xmath91 ground states .",
    "indeed , it was suggested that ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 might be assigned to @xmath91 . in the same paper",
    "it was postulated that ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 could be a candidate for the quadrupolar - spin nematic region of the phase diagram .",
    "however , this seems inconsistent , if v(ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 ) @xmath5 v(ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 ) , as argued here . for any of the above choices of ground state for ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 , given that both v / j and j/j are smaller for ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1",
    ", the afm100 state would be expected for this material , according to fig .",
    "it was suggested that disorder precludes the establishment of one of the predicted ground states for ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 .",
    "however , the level of one type of potential disorder , namely y / re intersite exchange , was examined using the very sensitive technique of @xmath100y magic angle spinning ( mas ) nmr and such disorder was not detected , placing an upper limit of @xmath1010.5 % on b / b site disorder @xcite .",
    "interestingly , y / m site disorder was easily seen by this method in the closely related double perovskites , ba@xmath0ymo@xmath1 at the levels of 1% ( m = ru ) and 3% ( m= mo ) @xcite .",
    "the ground states of these two materials appear to be unaffected by such larger disorder levels , as seen in table i. that an ordered ground state is not found for ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 indicates either that a very low , as yet undetectable , disorder level plays a decisive role or that one must go beyond the mean theory level of ref .",
    "@xcite to find an explanation .",
    "the double perovskite ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 , based on the 5@xmath8 ion , os@xmath9 , has been synthesized and characterized using neutron diffraction and @xmath10sr techniques which complement earlier studies of the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that cubic @xmath3 symmetry is retained to 3.5  k and that the material orders antiferromagnetically near 50  k with an estimated ordered moment size of @xmath120.2@xmath64 .",
    "however , the long - range nature of the ordered state can not be determined solely from the @xmath10sr data , as @xmath10sr is a local probe sensitive only to local field environments .",
    "this behaviour is in remarkable contrast to that of its isostructural and isoelectronic dppelganger , ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 , which , with essentially the same cubic unit cell constant , has a @xmath6 four times larger and is found in a spin frozen ground state with @xmath102  @xmath12  35  k @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 can also be contrasted with the closely related 4@xmath85 and 4@xmath103 based double perovskites , ba@xmath0yruo@xmath1 and ba@xmath0ymoo@xmath1 , which also exhibit cubic @xmath3 symmetry and have afm @xcite and gapped spin singlet ground states @xcite respectively .",
    "this is consistent of a general evolution from ordered to increasingly disordered ground states as one proceeds from @xmath85 to @xmath8 to @xmath103 systems .",
    "as monoclinic la@xmath0lireo@xmath1 also does not order @xcite , ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 is the first 5@xmath8 based double perovskite which does , exhibiting @xmath10sr spectra more closely resembling the 4@xmath85 ba@xmath0yruo@xmath1 than the isoelectronic 5@xmath8 system ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 .",
    "the properties of ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 and ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 have been discussed in the context of a recently published mean field theory for n@xmath8 double perovskites under the influence of strong soc @xcite . while ba@xmath0caoso@xmath1 might be described in terms of an exotic four sublattice afm state , @xmath90 or @xmath91 , it is difficult to accommodate ba@xmath0yreo@xmath1 within this theoretical framework . while some level of disorder might play a role in the latter case",
