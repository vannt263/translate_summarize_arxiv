    "in the first part of this work @xcite ( hereafter referred to as part  i ) , we have discussed the evolution of level energies and wave functions along the [ o(6)@xmath0u(5)]@xmath1o(5 ) transition in the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that this transitional class is integrable  due to the o(5 ) underlying symmetry and the associated seniority quantum number @xmath7and exhibits a second - order ground - state phase transition from deformed @xmath5-soft to spherical equilibrium shapes .    remind that our family of model hamiltonians is given by @xmath8 \\ , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 $ ] denoting a dimensionless control parameter that drives the system between the o(6 ) ( @xmath10 ) and u(5 ) ( @xmath11 ) dynamical symmetries .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath12 at any point of the transitional path depends on the specific interplay of both terms in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , where @xmath13^{(2)}$ ] represents the quadrupole operator and @xmath14 the @xmath15-boson number operator .",
    "note that @xmath16 is the total number of bosons , which in the classical limit tends to infinity ( both terms in the above hamiltonian are properly normalized by the @xmath17 denominators to yield finite contributions in this limit ) , and @xmath18  mev is an arbitrary scaling factor .",
    "the @xmath19 ground - state shape - phase transitions takes place at @xmath20 .",
    "we have shown that one of the most significant features of spectra in the @xmath9 $ ] transitional regime of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is the pattern of alternating compressions and dilutions of levels with angular momentum @xmath21 around energy @xmath6 .",
    "this pattern spreads over a wide interval of the control parameter between @xmath22 and 0.8 , see fig .",
    "1 in part  i. after deconvoluting spectra with different seniorities , it transforms into a sequence of avoided crossings that constitute what we called the shock - wave scenario  @xcite .",
    "the level bunching pattern represents basically a huge oscillation of the level density in the @xmath6 region , not dissimilar to shell effects in single - particle spectra of some quantum - mechanical potentials .",
    "there exists a deep and far - reaching relation between fluctuations of the quantum level density and properties of periodic orbits in the classical counterpart of the given system @xcite .",
    "while it is known that each periodic orbit brings one oscillatory term into the level density , with an amplitude related to the orbit s dimensionality and stability @xcite , the interference of several such terms gives rise to spectral _ beating patterns _ that underlie shell effects in nuclei , quantum dots , or metallic clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , as follows from the analysis performed by balian and bloch @xcite , the inclusion of just two simplest periodic orbits in a spheroidal cavity explains the essentials of the shell structure in these systems .",
    "majority of semiclassical studies on the level - density fluctuations was performed for hard - wall systems  two - dimensional billiards or three - dimensional cavities @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the calculation is considerably simplified since each individual orbit exists with easily predictable properties for all energies of the particle bouncing between the walls and contributes by a well - defined term to the single - particle level density . nevertheless , the influence of periodic orbits is equally important also in systems with soft  potentials , where the orbit analysis is much more involved .",
    "this is also the case of ibm , where the classical limit for @xmath21 describes two - dimensional motions within a bounded ( for each finite @xmath23 ) range of quadrupole deformation parameters , governed by a hamiltonian containing specific kinetic and potential terms @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present part of our contribution is to show that the shell effects and the ibm level bunching phenomenon are indeed of similar nature , both originating in some particular features of classical periodic trajectories .",
    "nevertheless , our reasoning does not only point to ordinary beating patterns , known from hard - wall systems , but makes use of two concepts that in the context of nuclear models are somewhat less usual .",
    "the first one relies on _ bifurcations _ of periodic orbits @xcite , the second on _ monodromy _ in classical and quantum integrable systems @xcite .",
    "both these effects lead to singular contributions to semiclassical trace formulas , that provide a simplified description of the level - density fluctuations .",
    "therefore , they can be potentially linked to anomalous effects in quantal spectra , such as the level bunching at @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ hami ] we review the construction of the classical limit of the ibm hamiltonian under study and describe basic features of the resulting classical dynamics . subsection [ berry ] briefly recapitulates the berry - tabor trace formula and the role of singular orbits and bifurcations in the semiclassical theory of quantal spectra",
    ". numerical analysis of orbits with @xmath21 , presented in sec .",
    "[ nume ] , shows that in the @xmath6 region our system passes through a robust structural change of classical dynamics .",
    "this change is correlated with the occurrence of a singular bundle of @xmath2 trajectories and triggers multiple bifurcations of orbits in the region @xmath3 .",
    "the relation of these findings to the concept of monodromy is discussed in section  [ mono ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclu ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "the classical limit of the ibm can be obtained via the well - known procedure , elaborated in detail by hatch and levit @xcite , and by alhassid and whelan @xcite .",
    "the procedure makes use of glauber coherent states @xmath24 with complex time - dependent coefficients @xmath25 which define a set of 12 classical - like variables ( both coordinates and momenta ) .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath26 are derived from the time - dependent variational principle , which results in the hamilton function given by the coherent - state average @xmath27 .",
    "this function and analogous counterparts of other operators can be obtained by substitutions @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the respective normal - ordered quantal expressions .",
    "since glauber coherent states do not fix the total number of bosons , an additional constraint must be required , namely @xmath30 .",
    "this ( plus an arbitrary choice of the overall phase , @xmath31 ) reduces the number of relevant degrees of freedom from six to five . naturally , the classicality of coherent states becomes more and more pronounced as @xmath16 increases and the fully classical limit is obtained in the @xmath19 limit . to prevent divergence of the corresponding averages",
    ", one has to scale all operators according to their order [ see the @xmath32 factors in hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) ] and to absorb the respective factors into the definition of @xmath26 s .",
    "this leads to the substitution @xmath33 while , simultaneously , the @xmath32 factors drop out .",
    "final expressions for the classical - limit observables are obtained after the identification of real coordinates @xmath34 and momenta @xmath35 via relations @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath34 are associated with the geometric variables describing an instantenous quadrupole deformation of the nucleus and its orientation in the laboratory frame . due to the fixed boson number average",
    ", the motion is constrained by the condition @xmath38 to the interior of a sphere in the 10-dimensional phase space .",
    "the calculation of classical observables is substantially simplified for zero angular momentum , @xmath21 @xcite . in this case , the intrinsic frame connected with the ellipsoid of deformation remains at rest and one can fix @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( while @xmath41 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 classical limit of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reads as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the squared radius in the @xmath44 plane ( the polar angle denoted as @xmath5 ) and @xmath45 the squared length of the associated vector of momenta : @xmath46    hamiltonian ( [ clas ] ) can be thought to describe planar motions of a particle with the position - dependent kinetic energy @xmath47 in potential @xmath48 , which is for @xmath10 , 0.6 and 1 shown in figure  [ champ ] . while for @xmath49 , the potential has the mexican hat  ( or champagne bottle ) form , for @xmath50 it is just a well with minimum at @xmath51 . to emphasize the rotational symmetry in the @xmath52 plane , we show both positive and negative  domains of @xmath4 ( the latter corresponding to the rotation by angle @xmath53 ) . as follows from the form of the potential and from eq .",

    "since in the latter case each oscillatory term in the berry - tabor formula contains also a nontrivial energy dependence of the amplitude , the semiclassical analysis of spectra in such cases is certainly much less intuitive than in the hard - wall systems .    in general , there may exist singular orbits with diverging contributions to the berry - tabor formula .",
    "this happens if either the period of the given orbit grows to infinity , @xmath113 , or if the denominator of the prefactor in eq .",

    "[ mono ] .    the second possible source of infinite contributions to the berry - tabor formula ( [ bt ] )",
    "is connected with the cases when @xmath116 .",

    "note that the gutzwiller formula @xcite , which is valid in nonintegrable systems with isolated periodic orbits , is formally similar to eq .",

    "the new orbits are detached from the primitive orbit @xmath132 as its period @xmath103-tupling clones .",
    "consequently , @xmath132 is not isolated and the corresponding term in the gutzwiller formula diverges .",
    "this situation is analogous to the one with @xmath129 , as described above .",
    "both the above singular cases correspond to the same general phenomenon , called bifurcation @xcite . in hamilton systems of classical mechanics , bifurcations represent branching of periodic orbits at some critical values of energy or other parameters @xcite .",
    "while periodic orbits existing below and above the given bifurcation energy @xmath136 are isolated , either in the sense of @xmath127 or @xmath134\\neq 0 $ ] , at @xmath137 two or more orbits merge together in the way described above , giving rise to zero denominators of the respective semiclassical level - density formulas . at the bifurcation energies",
    "@xmath136 , the berry - tabor or gutzwiller formulas do not represent correct approximations of the fluctuating level density . improved semiclassical methods were developed to treat these situations",
    "intuitively one expects an enhancement of the level - density oscillations at the bifurcation points . in the following subsection",
    "we will show that in our system numerous bifurcations of periodic orbits take place in the energy range @xmath3 .",
    "we have performed a numerical analysis of classical motions corresponding to hamiltonian ( [ clas ] ) in the interval of energies @xmath138 $ ] using a sample of about 50000 generated orbits .",
    "individual trajectories were calculated with initial positions and momenta chosen randomly within the phase - space region accessible at a given energy and classified by the ratio @xmath139 of periods @xmath140 and @xmath141 associated with oscillations in both @xmath5 and @xmath4 directions , respectively . since @xmath142 and the angular velocity @xmath143 connected with @xmath4-vibrations are both time dependent , one has to use the corresponding average angular frequencies per period , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "their inverse ratio coincides with @xmath146 and is analogous to the above - discussed ratio @xmath100 of frequencies in the action - angle variables .",
    "in particular , rational values @xmath147 correspond to periodic orbits with period @xmath148 .",
    "examples of periodic orbits with various rational values of the ratio ( [ fract ] ) are shown in figure  [ traje ] .",
    "the rational fraction @xmath147 classifying the given orbit has visual meaning as the number of outer return points of the @xmath4-vibration over the number of rotations in the @xmath5-direction needed to close the orbit .",

    "[ traje ] do not just trivially bounce between the outer ( and inner ) limits , as in the case of circular or annular infinite sharp wells , they still resemble to a large extent the trajectories in these simple systems @xcite .",
    "periodic orbits form a dense subset of all allowed motions and we therefore need a more complete picture .",

    "note that the rapidity of changes of classical motions around zero energy is connected with the fact that for @xmath171 the radius of the central disc converges to zero with a rate increasing to infinity ( @xmath172 ) , as directly follows from the form of the potential @xmath48 close to the @xmath51 maximum .",

    "( c ) for @xmath187 , the @xmath89 bands look similar as in case ( b ) , but terminate at energies just below @xmath2 , supposedly following the steep @xmath82 branch of the curve @xmath163 .",

    "unfortunately , the unstable orbits are not accessible to numerical studies , so they are not seen in fig .",
    "[ widle ] .",
    "this problem may be further investigated analytically .",
    "it follows from the above discussion that the bifurcations are connected only with the region of positive energies ( there is a ridge of @xmath153 values , apparent in the inset of fig",
    ".  [ domain ] , which is located solely at the @xmath163 edge with @xmath3 ) .",
    "this implies that divergences of the berry - tabor formula associated with bifurcations are not directly relevant in the explanation of the main level - bunching pattern in fig .  1 of part  i @xcite ( except perhaps the 3/1 case with @xmath190 ) .",
    "bifurcation energies for low - period orbits are not even correlated with the secondary , less pronounced bunchings of levels , observed in the region @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that the presence of various orbits in the same energy range and an interplay of their bifurcations result in interferences that wash out contributions of individual orbits .    on the other hand , highly organized behavior of levels at @xmath6",
    "perfectly coincides with the predicted existence of a singular torus of orbits with infinite period at zero energy , and also with the observed abrupt redistribution of the spectrum of orbits in a narrow vicinity of this energy .",
    "the anomalous @xmath2 bundle of orbits with infinite period , discussed in sec .  [ berry ] , is related to a more general phenomenon , called monodromy .",
    "classical monodromy in integrable hamilton systems can be briefly introduced as the impossibility to define global action - angle variables due to the existence of a singular , so called pinched  torus @xcite .",
    "the name @xmath191 ( once around ) originates from a property similar to that of the m \" obius strip : if one follows a closed loop in the space of regular tori around the singular torus and  loosely speaking  redefines the coordinate system on the consecutive tori continuously on the way along the loop , one returns back to the starting torus with a coordinate system that differs from the initial one .",
    "classical monodromy affects the quantum counterpart of the system via the einstein - brillouin - kramers ( ebk ) quantization rules @xcite .",
    "it turns out that quantum monodromy can be seen as a point defect in the lattice of quantum numbers corresponding to a complete set of commuting operators .",
    "this defect results in a transformation of the elementary quantum cell when a closed loop is completed around the singular point , in analogy with the above feature of phase - space tori .",
    "an overview of the mathematical background and various examples of monodromy can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "soon after its discovery in 1980 @xcite it became clear that monodromy substantially affects global features of numerous integrable systems , which might previously be considered as too trivial for detailed analyses .",
    "the simplest system that exhibits monodromy is the spherical pendulum ",
    "particle moving on a sphere in a gravitational field .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the phase - space torus passing the unstable equilibrium position at the north pole , with the particle energy exactly equal to the critical value @xmath192 needed to reach that point , is pinched , i.e. , one of its basic circles is contracted to a single point ( with appropriate initial conditions the particle is at rest ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the lattice of quantum states , characterized by quantum numbers enumerating energy @xmath23 and the projection @xmath193 of angular momentum , has a point defect at @xmath194 .",
    "it was found that closely related to this simple observation is the realization of monodromy in vibrational and rotational spectra of some molecules @xcite .",
    "other examples of monodromy can be found in the following systems : particle in quartic , sextic , and decatic potentials @xcite , hydrogen atom in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields @xcite , systems of two or three coupled angular momenta @xcite , particle bouncing between walls in a prolate elliptic cavity @xcite or moving in a two - center attractive potential @xcite . like in the spherical pendulum , monodromy in several of the latter systems",
    "is connected with the trajectories passing with the critical energy via the point of an unstable equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we already know that a similar point , namely the top of the central maximum at @xmath51 , can be found in our classical hamiltonian ( [ clas ] ) for @xmath195 , with @xmath196 being the minimal energy needed to pass through this point . in fact , our hamiltonian for @xmath197 is identical with the champagne - bottle  hamiltonian of ref .",

    "[ hami ] that although the physical quantum states can be represented by non - negative values of @xmath75 , the intrinsic degeneracy of classical motions in both @xmath5-directions results in mirror imaging of all states with @xmath225 into the @xmath226 half - plane ( to guarantee a smooth continuation of quantum numbers , we assign values @xmath227 to these twin  states ) . in absence of monodromy , one must be able to engage all states in the _ extended _ lattice into a crystal  grid of continuous and _ smooth _ lines , corresponding to constant values of two compatible global quantum numbers , with elementary cells   of the grid being topologically equivalent to squares . from fig .",
    "[ lattice](a ) we see that a smooth grid , symmetric under the @xmath228 reflection , can be constructed in the o(6 ) case , using the pair of generating quantum numbers @xmath215 . in the u(5 )",

    "the latter structure can be extended to the whole interval @xmath230 $ ] where the u(5)-like spectrum exists .",
    "in contrast , quantum monodromy implies the absence of a smooth _ global _ grid .",

    "[ lattice](b ) , where a smooth grid for @xmath82 would be generated by the pair of quantum numbers @xmath231 , but for @xmath3 by the pair @xmath229 .",
    "any attempt to define two global quantum numbers that behave smoothly in the entire lattice for @xmath232 fails at the point @xmath233 , which represents the singular torus of trajectories and , simultaneously , a defect  in the quantum lattice of states @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in the transition to the o(6 ) limit the defect is gradually pushed up to the upper edge of the lattice . for the whole interval",
    "@xmath232 the singular point indicates the place where the energy - momentum map passes between the o(6 ) and u(5 ) types of elementary cells ",
    "tetragons with ordered @xmath215 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 vertices , and analogous tetragons in @xmath229 , respectively .",
    "note that elementary cells of either type can not be uniquely defined along a closed loop around the singular point since after one turn the cell gets distorted .",
    "this can be illustrated by a graphical construction in fig .",
    "[ lattice](b ) and its mirror image , but the rigorous proof would require an infinite density of the lattice in the @xmath19 limit .",
    "the last observation represents a common quantum signature of monodromy @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that monodromy in the present case is not a property of just a single hamiltonian , but characterizes the whole @xmath237 family ( [ ham ] ) of transitional systems . since  as shown in part  i @xcite  the most substantial changes in quantum spectra of these systems take place in the @xmath6 region , monodromy seems to play the key role in the process of redistribution of individual levels between the o(6 ) and u(5 ) multiplets .",
    "related examples exist also in other parametric families of hamiltonians , for instance , in transitions between uncoupled and coupled regimes of two quantum rotators @xcite and between zeeman and stark limits of the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "also in these examples , the crossover between the limiting spectral structures takes place at the point ( or in the interval ) of control parameters and energy where monodromy exists .",
    "these findings deserve further investigation .",
    "in the present part of our work , devoted to the [ o(6)@xmath0u(5)]@xmath1o(5 ) transition of the interacting boson model , we have studied the classical limit of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with zero angular momentum .",
    "results of the analysis of level dynamics , presented in part  i @xcite , were qualitatively discussed with the aid of the berry - tabor semiclassical trace formula , which describes fluctuations of quantum spectra in integrable systems in terms of families of periodic orbits existing at various energies .",
    "the transitional regime was exemplified by the choice of a single value of the control parameter , @xmath76 .    both possible sources of diverging contributions to the trace formula ( [ bt ] ) , namely , the existence of bifurcating ( @xmath189 ) and singular ( @xmath238 ) orbits , were identified in our system . while bifurcations of periodic orbits with ratios between @xmath5- and @xmath4-vibration periods @xmath182 $ ] were shown to exist in the region @xmath3 , singular orbits with @xmath87 appear at @xmath2 .",
    "the latter finding led to the identification of classical monodromy , which on the quantum level exhibits itself as a defect in the lattice of quantum states located at zero values of energy and seniority .",
    "this results in the bunching of levels in the @xmath6 region @xcite and underlies the process of redistribution of states between o(6 ) and u(5 ) spectral structures , i.e. , between the @xmath215 and @xmath229 types of elementary cells , and the respective multiplets of levels .",
    "also the numerical analysis of periodic and nonperiodic classical vibrations disclosed that the most substantial changes in the spectrum of allowed ratios @xmath146 take place in a very narrow energy interval around @xmath6 .",
    "this interval represents a kind of demarcation line between the o(6 ) and u(5 ) types of classical motions . at @xmath239 ,",
    "the inaccessible central disc in the plane of deformation parameters becomes sufficiently small to allow for vibrations with @xmath182 $ ] , and at @xmath2 , when the disc vanishes , the oscillator - like orbits with @xmath240 arise . with the energy further growing to positive values , individual vibrations with @xmath241 eventually disappear in bifurcations ( annihilations  of two separate @xmath89 branches of a given orbit ) .",
