    "the metal to insulator transition in v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a long standing yet not completely resolved issue .",

    "the relevance of possible electron - lattice interactions has been stressed by recent theoretical work.@xcite    in an earlier paper@xcite we have shown that a detailed understanding of the interplay of structural and electronic degrees of freedom requires both information on the global structure as measured by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and of the local structure of the compound .",
    "interatomic distances and symmetries can deviate locally from the global lattice symmetry , therefore indicating the presence of an order - disorder component of the transitions or of structural fluctuations .",
    "our earlier results demonstrate that the two insulating phases of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , the paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) and the antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase , are structurally very similar on a local scale and therefore indicate that there might exist a common route for both the transitions from the paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phase to the pi and the afi phase , respectively .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the local structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 in the vicinity of the pm to afi transition to shed light on the detailed structural changes associated with the mit .",
    "the results of our temperature dependent extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) measurements show a rather complex behavior of the local structure , which differs along different crystallographic axes . in particular , we observe a structural precursor to the mit which consists of characteristic changes of nearest neighbor distances for the first time .",
    "exafs measurements were performed on a v@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal grown by chemical transport using tecl@xmath2 as transport agent .",
    "the crystal was mounted on a thin glass plate and reduced in thickness by lapping and polishing the sample down to approximately 12 @xmath3 m which corresponds to roughly two absorption lengths .",
    "this treatment allowed to detect the x - ray absorption in a transmission geometry , thereby avoiding damping of the signal due to selfabsorption effects which would have been present in fluorescence mode.@xcite the sample was oriented so that the angle between the polarization vector @xmath4 of the incoming x - rays and the hexagonal @xmath5 axis of the crystal ( @xmath6 ) could be changed by rotating the sample around the surface normal .",
    "measurements were made with @xmath4 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath6 .",

    "contacts were made by attaching platinum wires ( diameter : 40  @xmath3 m ) to the sample by silver epoxy .",

    "the electronic transition was observed at a temperature of 130 k at the cold finger of the cryostat .",

    "the analysis of the polarization dependent measurements reveals that two distinct movements with different temperature dependencies have to be distinguished : the positioning of the vanadium ions within the basal plane and the change of the v - v pair distance perpendicular to the basal plane , i.e. along the hexagonal @xmath5-axis .",
    "the former movement determines the rotation of these vanadium pairs , ranging from an alignment parallel to @xmath6 in the pm phase to a tilt of roughly 2@xmath56 away from this axis in the afi phase.@xcite following tanaka,@xcite hybridization between the @xmath57 and the @xmath58 orbitals increases on rotating the v@xmath16v@xmath17 pairs out of the direction of the @xmath5-axis .",
    "depending on the hybridization strength , two minima of the free energy exist , which are characterized by two different equilibrium distances between the two nearest v neighbors along @xmath6 .",
    "while the electron - lattice coupling is weak when the v - v pair is aligned parallel to the hexagonal @xmath5-axis , increased hybridization on tilting the pair renders the orbital configuration almost energetically degenerate .",
    "the so modified interactions favor a new ground state configuration with a reduced occupation of the @xmath57 orbital.@xcite in this configuration , the electron - lattice coupling is strong and an enlarged v pair distance is expected .    we observe a continuously increasing tilt , starting well above the mit and continuing even within the afi phase . along with",
    "it , the hybridization strength increases as just pointed out . at a certain hybridization strength ,",
    "the system snaps into the second minimum of the free energy , which corresponds to the enlarged pair distance .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the v@xmath16v@xmath17 distance expands primarily after the tilt of the pair has adopted its maximum value , what is exactly the behavior we observe experimentally .",
    "our measurements thereby substantiate the scenario proposed by tanaka which does not regard the metal - insulator transitions in v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( both the pm to afi and the pm to pi transitions ) as usual mott transitions.@xcite the fact , that on a local scale the trigonal symmetry is not fully recovered in the metallic phase , suggests that the trigonal and monoclinic structure are very close in energy , allowing fluctuations between the two .",
    "we want to point out that the present results are consistent with our earlier findings@xcite that the trigonal symmetry can be broken on a local scale while the global symmetry remains trigonal .    in step with the separation of the two neighboring v ions along the hexagonal @xmath5 axis an `` umbrella like '' distortion of the oxygen coordination octahedron around each v ion occurs.@xcite",
    "thus , the trigonal distortion of the coordination octahedron is directly determined by the distance between the next v neighbors along @xmath6 .",
    "the increased distortion of the oxygen octahedron is responsible for the stabilization of the insulating state@xcite since it results in a large shift of ( dynamical ) spectral weight .",
    "however , from theoretical considerations it has been pointed out@xcite that in - plane interactions are important for the mit in v@xmath0o@xmath1 and and should not be treated as small perturbations . this view is supported by our measurements which suggest that in - plane interactions are a decisive ingredient to the mit by triggering the modification of the v@xmath16v@xmath17 distance via changes in hybridization .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the debye - waller factor of the in - plane vanadium neighbors does not display substantial changes at the transition .",
    "if structural degrees of freedom were the driving force behind the increase of the in - plane interatomic distances , the debye - waller factor should be strongly affected .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the change in hybridization is driven by orbital interactions .",
    "the change in hybridization will also result in a change of the crystal field splitting and accordingly alter the orbital occupation .",
    "evidence for orbital interactions is given from neutron scattering results by bao _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite as shown by laad _",
    "_ , the variation of orbital occupation can result in a first order phase transition.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , the measurements of the local structure of pure v@xmath0o@xmath1 in the vicinity of the metal to insulator transition show that complex changes of the interatomic distances on a local scale are decisive for the changes of the physical properties at the transition .",
    "we can distinguish between two structural effects with different temperature characteristics : at the onset of the electronic and magnetic transition temperature , the next vanadium neighbors along the hexagonal @xmath5 axis abruptly increase their distance , resulting in an increase of the trigonal crystal field component and a shift of spectral weight , rendering the system insulating .",
    "however , a continuous increase of the monoclinic distortion in the basal plane is already observed far above the mit reaching its maximum value at the onset of the electronic and magnetic transition .",
    "while the monoclinic distortion , in other words the tilt of the @xmath5-axis vanadium pair against this axis , determines the orbital configuration via changes in hybridization strength , the pair distance only reacts to these changes by locking into one of the two minima of the free energy defined by the orbital configuration .",
    "these findings suggest that the metal to insulator transition could be driven by changes in the hybridization triggered by in - plane orbital interactions ."
