    "the helicity integral @xmath57 can be split into the contributions of every single ring separately , since the magnetic field is zero outside the flux rings . for a thin ring the integral can be approximated by @xmath58 here @xmath18 is the magnetic flux in a single ring and the integral is evaluated along a closed curve running along the center of the flux ring . through stokes theorem",
    "the integral can be rewritten to : @xmath59 where the definition for the vector potential @xmath60 has been used , and @xmath61 indicates the magnetic flux throught the surface enclosed by the curve .",

    "the same alfvenic timescale is used .",
    "the fields evolve in the same manner as the linked fields rings in the paper , with an initial fast drop in magnetic energy , followed by a much slower decay .",
