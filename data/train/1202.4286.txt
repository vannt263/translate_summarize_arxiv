    "coastline morphology is of current interest in geophysical research and coastline erosion may have important economic consequences  @xcite .",
    "even more , the concern about global warming has increased the demand for a better understanding of coastal evolution .",
    "this paper deals specifically with the erosion of rocky coasts .",
    "rocky coasts have been estimated to represent @xmath1 of the world s shorelines  @xcite .",
    "they are found in different contexts , and there exists a rich bibliography on the subject , see for example  @xcite and the references therein , as well as  @xcite for an update bibliography . however , this estimation strongly depends on the very definition of what constitutes a rocky coast .",
    "many cliffed coasts are fronted by beaches , with many different morphologies and several different dynamical processes in action .",
    "the morphology of these sea - shores may result from several different processes ; tectonicity and various erosion mechanisms ( sea , rivers , wind ) acting on different soils as well as the possible role of sediment transport .",
    "sea erosion can be imperceptibly slow , but nevertheless shapes coastal morphology .",
    "it can also be observed over human timescale , being of concern to planners .",
    "for instance , a study of cliff coasts in new zealand reports sea erosion rates with peaks as high as @xmath2 meters in one year  @xcite ( with typical rates ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 m / yr ) . eroding cliffed shorelines account for @xmath5 of the entire new zealand coast  @xcite .",
    "accordingly to the definition of rocky coasts given in  @xcite , here we address coasts dynamics in the limiting case where the role of sediment transport is considered to be negligible .",
    "for instance , tectonically active coasts often display rocky coasts with very limited sediment deposited by rivers ( as in peru and chile or along the north america cordillera ) . the rugged appearance of these coasts is usually considered as an extension of the rugged mountains characterizing the nearby landscape , however it is difficult to exclude that sea wave erosion does not play a role in their morphology .",
    "collision coasts also tend to be rocky , containing few depositional features . because of their relative youth , neo - trailing edge coasts , such as the arabian coast along the red sea , are also rugged and mostly rocky . furthermore , there are many sites throughout the world where rocky and rugged coasts are found in tectonically passive margins , such as south africa , parts of argentina and brazil , eastern canada , southern australia and a section of north - west europe",
    ".    one might think that wave erosion can play a role in relatively low rocky coasts , but the height of the cliff is not a general contraindication for erosive sea dynamics .",
    "very often these coasts exhibit some kind of irregular morphology . in the last decades , attempts to describe global geometry of sea - coasts",
    "have been made using the tools of fractal geometry to the point that the coast of britain has been taken as an introductory archetype of self - similarity in nature  @xcite . since then",
    ", many tentative applications of fractal concepts to geomorphology  @xcite have been published but at the same time there has been some debate about the fractality of coastlines  @xcite .    in other words , coasts and rocky coasts may be fractal or not , depending possibly on the scale on which the coast is observed . often but not always , different scales exhibit different shapes .",
    "this corresponds to the variety of possible contributions to coast morphology mentioned above .",
    "nevertheless , the observation of geometrical similarities and the presence of `` some sort '' of scale invariance in the morphology of rocky coasts , may suggest the existence of a common mechanism which , when in action , shapes this type of coastline .",
    "a qualitative model for the appearance of fractal sea - coasts had been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that irregular coasts contribute to the damping of sea waves with the consequence that the resulting erosion is weaker .",
    "more recently , a numerical model of such coastal dynamics was developed  @xcite and studied .",
    "it was found that a mechanism based on the retro - action of coastal shape on wave damping , leads necessarily , for the specific case worked in this paper , to the self - stabilization of a fractal coastline .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the self - stabilized geometry belongs to a well defined universality class , precisely characterized in the mathematical theory of percolation  @xcite . in that sense , the notion of fractal geometry for rocky sea - coasts should no more appear as a curiosity , but as a necessary consequence of percolation theory .    in this paper",
    "we advocate the model , discussing the statistical analysis of earth geomorphological data , the possible role of sediments in erosion , the role of large scale heterogeneity in the lithology of the eroded coasts , and we address the problem of statistical characterization of different non fractal morphologies predicted by the model .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .    in section  [ sec :",
    "singular ] we present some statistical field geomorphological data that suggest that coastlines geometry differs from the general earth geomorphology .",
    "our specific erosion model , based on the aforementioned retro - action mechanism , is presented in section  [ sec : model ] . there",
    "we discuss the fundamental connection between our model and the general theory of percolation .",
    "the erosion dynamics , short and long term evolutions , are discussed in section  [ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "we also discuss how the critical nature of percolation , results in a very irregular , or episodic , erosion process .",
    "the question of fractal versus non - fractal sea - coast is discussed in section  [ sec : fractalornot ] .",
    "more precisely we give statistical arguments that could help to distinguish transitory from final morphology .    in section  [",
    "sec : geology ] we address the fundamental question of the role of geology in the frame of our retro - action model .",
    "the qualitative results is that , very often , coastal morphology should be the results of both retro - action and geological constraints .    in section  [ sec : sediment ] we discuss the possible role of sediments and rubbles in the erosion process .",
    "we show that in various cases the same scaling and morphologies should be obtained .    in section  [ sec : complexity ] we present some detailed data analysis of some rocky coasts , unfolding the complexity of the real morphology of coastlines as well as of the inland coastal regions .    in section  [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "we give the summary and conclusion of the paper .",
    "a question that can be raised , observing rocky coasts , is whether their geometry is simply inherited by the morphology of the inland  @xcite , or whether the interaction with the sea changes and shapes the coast in a distinct way . in order to disentangle and recognize specific features of coastlines , with respect to higher earth surface isolines ,",

    "interestingly , exactly at @xmath8 elevation a rapid change in the measured average fractal dimension is observed .",
    "this gives an indication that the interaction between sea and land is responsible for the complex geometry of coastlines .",
    "in this sense , a model for the geometry of rocky coastlines should explicitly take in account the main physical processes taking places at the interface between sea and land , that is the dynamics of coastal erosion .",

    "discussion of several other examples of coastline complexity will be given in section  [ sec : complexity ] below . through these more detailed examples ,",
    "we wish to put forward the idea that those shores with _ high local slopes ( or terrain gradients ) at the shore _ may be reasonably attributed to marine erosion , acting in a given geological context .",
    "rocky coasts erosion is the product of marine and atmospheric causes  @xcite .",
    "there exist many different erosion processes : wave quarrying , abrasion , wetting and drying , frost shattering , thermal expansion , salt water corrosion , carbonation , hydrolysis . in the same time , the mechano - chemical properties of the rocks constituting the coast , which are linked to structure , composition and aging defining their `` lithology '' , exhibit an unknown dispersion .",
    "on the other hand , erosion is the consequence of the existence of an `` erosion power '' .",
    "it is a selective mechanism , which progressively eliminates the weaker parts of the surface .",
    "the remaining shore is then hardened as compare to the initial shore .",
    "but the erosion power is not constant and may change during erosion . in particular , damping mechanisms caused by the erosion itself could arise , establishing a self - stabilizing mechanism . in other words , erosion is the product of three ingredients : erosion power , rocks lithology , _ and _ a damping depending on the shore morphology .",
    "the interplay between these three factors is discussed here in various conditions , through the numerical implementation of a simple model  @xcite .",
    "the specific damping mechanism considered here , relies on the studies of irregular or fractal acoustic cavities .",
    "they show that viscous damping is increased on a longer , irregular surface  @xcite .",
    "these considerations have been applied practically in the conception of efficient acoustic road absorber now installed along several roads in france  @xcite .",
    "an other example of the proposed selection mechanism , is the case of the dynamics of pit corrosion of thin aluminum films  @xcite .",
    "there , fractal geometries spontaneously appears at the interface of the corroded solid .",
    "the phenomenon can be understood by means of a minimal model  @xcite , which disregards many atomic details of the corrosion process .",
    "the analogy between erosion and corrosion is less artificial than one could think _ a priori _ ( see discussion in section  [ sec : sediment ] ) .    in the following we make an arbitrary distinction between _",
    "`` rapid '' _ mechanical erosion ( namely wave quarrying ) and _ `` slow '' _ weakening of the rocks due to the action of the elements ( weathering processes ) .",
    "these _ `` slow '' _ weakening events trigger , from time to time , new _",
    "`` rapid '' _ erosion sequences .",
    "the justification is that mechanical erosion generally occurs rapidly , mainly during storms , after rocks has been slowly altered and weakened .",
    "we first study this supposedly rapid erosion mechanisms .",
    "then we show that the full complex dynamics , involving fast and slow processes , changes the shape of the coast on a longer time scale keeping its gross geometrical characteristics .",
    "this dynamics is reminiscent of the _ quasi - equilibrium _ evoked by trenhaile  @xcite ( see below )    our model schematize the sea , the land , and their interaction in the following way .      in analogy with the acoustic oscillations in a cavity , the sea , together with the coast ,",
    "is considered to constitute a resonator  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that there exists an average excitation power of the waves @xmath13 .",
    "the `` force '' acting on the unitary length of the coast is measured by the square of the wave amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "this wave amplitude is related to @xmath13 by a relation of the type @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the morphology dependent quality factor of the system : the smaller the quality factor , the stronger the damping of the sea - waves .",
    "there are several different causes for damping .",
    "since the different loss mechanisms occur independently , the quality factor satisfies a relation of the type @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quality factor due to the `` viscous '' dissipation of the fluid moving along the coast and the nearby islands and @xmath19 is related to other damping mechanisms ( e.g. bulk viscous damping ) .",
    "studies of fractal or irregular acoustic cavities  @xcite have shown that the viscous damping increases roughly proportionally to the cavity perimeter .",
    "this model uses , as a working hypothesis , the idea that sea - waves are more damped along an irregular coast much in the same way as acoustic modes in irregular cavities .",
    "this appears to be an empirically known effect used to build efficient break - waters that are based on hierarchical accumulations of tetrapods piled over layers of smaller and smaller rocks , in close analogy with fractal geometry ( see fig .",

    "our measure of the fractal dimension of such coast is close to @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",height=158 ]    to check the relation between irregularity and damping for the particular shapes of a sea - coast during erosion , we consider the properties of four 2d resonators , with the upper side corresponding to four successive coast shapes . for each time and morphology",
    "we solve numerically the helmoltz wave equation with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we compute the eigenmodes in a given frequency range , assuming weak losses on the eroding profile . for each eigenmode",
    "we compute the energy dissipation which is supposed to take place on the coast . in other words",
    "we study the wave dissipation due to viscous forces acting on the boundary of irregular swimming pools .",

    "[ fig : cavities ] , showing that the average losses of the computed eigenmodes in the four resonators increase roughly proportionally to the coast perimeter .",

    "the coast perimeter @xmath20 increases and the damping increases roughly proportionally to the coast perimeter . ]",
    "therefore , one can , in first approximation , assume that @xmath18 is inversely proportional to the coast perimeter @xmath21 whereas @xmath19 is independent of the coast morphology . in other words ,",
    "the sea exerts a homogeneous erosion power @xmath22 on each coast element proportional to @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath21 is the total length of the coast at time @xmath25 ( then @xmath26 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath27 measures the relative contribution to damping of a flat shore as compared with the total damping .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the renormalized value of @xmath13 such that @xmath29 at all @xmath25 .",
    "small @xmath27 factor correspond to _ weak coupling _ between the erosion power and the coast length and large @xmath27 correspond to _",
    "strong coupling_.    note that for the higher frequency waves with short wavelengths that contains a large erosion power , it is clear that their damping is proportional to the coast perimeter .",
    "these are the breaking waves usually considered to be the most erosive waves .",
    "the functional dependence of the erosion force as a function of the coast perimeter could be different without affecting the results .",
    "rather , a better model for damping should take care of a possible wave frequency dependence as well as the possibility of localization effects along the irregular coast  @xcite",
    ". this would modify eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] and change the time evolution .",
    "note however , that what is important here is that , as erosion proceeds and sea `` penetrates '' progressively the earth , the erosion power is diminished .",
    "this is the essence of such a retro - action model .",
    "any model which would present this property would lead to the same type of results .",
    "in particular if erosion sediments stay locally on the sea floor , ( are not transported ) and contribute to damping , the erosion power would decrease as a function of the total amount of material already eroded and would create the same type of effects ( see below ) .",
    "the `` resisting '' random earth is modeled by a square lattice of random units of global width @xmath30 .",
    "each site represents a small portion of the earth , named _ a rock _ here .",
    "the sea acts on a shoreline constituted of these rocks , each one characterized by a random number @xmath31 , between @xmath8 and @xmath32 , representing its lithology .",
    "the erosion model should also take into account that a site surrounded by the sea is weaker than a site surrounded by earth sites .",
    "hence , the resistance to erosion @xmath33 of a site depends on both its lithology and the number of sides exposed to the action of the sea .",
    "this is implemented here through the following weakening rule : sites surrounded by three earth sites have a resistance @xmath34 . if in contact with @xmath35 sea sites the resistance is assumed to be equal to @xmath36 . and",
    ", if site @xmath37 is attacked by @xmath38 or @xmath9 sides , it has zero resistance .",
    "the iterative evolution rule is simple : at computer time step @xmath25 , all coast sites with @xmath39 are eroded ( sometimes exposing new sites to erosion ) , and then @xmath21 and @xmath22 are updated together with the resistances of the earth sites in contact with the sea .",
    "then , from one step to the next , some sites are eroded because they present a `` weak lithology '' while some strong sites are eroded due to their weaker stability due to sea neighboring .",
    "an example of local evolution is shown in fig .",

    "we will see below in section  [ sec : fractalornot ] that there exists statistical methods to distinguish transitory ( young coasts ) from final morphologies ( old coasts ) .    in summary",
    ", we discuss a model which although based on very few ingredients , gives rise to a variety of coastline morphologies , fractal or simply rugged , transitory or final .",
    "our study indicates the existence of a connection between coastal erosion of rocky coasts and percolation theory .",
    "percolation is a cornerstone of the theory of disordered systems , which has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics , materials science , complex networks , epidemiology , etc .",
    "@xcite    percolation theory deals with the following statistical problem .",
    "consider a lattice , like the square lattice for instance , and independently assign to each site a random number obtained from a uniform distribution between @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "now select the set of sites which happen to have a number smaller than some fixed arbitrary value @xmath53 and occupy them .",
    "if these selected sites are first nearest neighbors , they define so - called clusters .",
    "of course if @xmath53 is small , the clusters themselves will be of small size .",
    "however , strictly above a critical value @xmath54 , there exists an infinite cluster that crosses the lattice from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "the most important characteristics of percolation phenomena is that near criticality , that is when @xmath53 is close to @xmath54 , the scaling properties of the system are independent of the lattice geometry .",
    "although the value of the percolation threshold @xmath54 does depend on the lattice under consideration the exponents of the so - called scaling laws that describe the properties of clusters and the geometry of the infinite cluster at percolation are independent of the lattice .",
    "in particular the external frontier of the percolation cluster is fractal with a fractal dimension exactly equal to @xmath55 and the so - called accessible perimeter has a fractal dimension equal to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "as the reader can suspect , there is a similarity between the percolation cluster and the coastline produced by our model .",
    "in fact , at the end of the erosion process , all earth sites at the interface with the sea have a resistance larger than the wave erosive power .",
    "so , in some sense , our erosion model spontaneously identifies , and stops at , a percolating interface constituted of `` strong '' sites .    indeed",
    ", there exist a direct relation between our model and the theory of percolation .",
    "in particular , besides the fractal dimension of the coast , the behavior of the width @xmath43 as a function of the coupling factor @xmath27 exhibit a power law dependance , as shown in fig .",
    "this power law is characteristic of a specific variant of percolation , called _ gradient percolation _  @xcite . in the appendix  [ app : gp ]",
    "we explain gradient percolation and how it can be related to our erosion model .    at this stage",
    "it is important to recall briefly the concept of universality in statistical physics .",
    "universality means that several very different phenomena can exhibit analogous macroscopic properties described by the same power law exponents .",
    "the phenomena which exhibits the same exponents belong to a unique _ universality classes_. the models described in this paper , percolation , gradient percolation , our model of coastal erosion , all belongs to the percolation universality class , irrespectively of many details .",
    "for example , if we change the lattice geometry , or the distribution of the rocks lithology , the model still belongs to the percolation universality class .",
    "here it means that shorelines made of rocks of different nature and sizes , subjected to different external climate , can exhibit the same large scale geometrical properties .",
    "recent studies inspired by our model , corroborates the deep connection between coastal morphology and percolation .",
    "a remarkable property of such real coasts has been observed : they have been found to be conformally invariant  @xcite .",
    "this geometrical property stands for itself but there exists a mathematical demonstration that it exists for the so - called accessible perimeter of the percolation cluster .",
    "( it should be stressed that not every fractal with dimension @xmath0 is conformally invariant .",
    "let now describe in more detail the erosion dynamics resulting from the minimal rules defined by our model . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider first the case of a flat ( smooth ) initial coastline submitted to the erosion action of the sea .",
    "as discussed later ( section  [ sec : smoothing ] ) , the dynamics with different initial morphologies can be understood from these results .      in the first steps of the dynamics",
    "the erosion front keeps quite smooth and it roughens progressively as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] . during the process",
    ", finite clusters are detached from the infinite earth , creating _",
    "islands_. at any time , both the islands and the coastline perimeters contribute to the damping .",
    "as the total coastline length @xmath21 increases , the sea force becomes weaker . at a certain time",
    "step @xmath56 , the weakest point of the coast is stronger than @xmath57 and the `` rapid '' dynamics stops .",
    "this indicates that erosion reinforces the coast by preferential elimination of its weakest elements until the coast is strong enough to resist further erosion .",
    "whatever the dynamics , at the stopping time @xmath56 the coastline is irregular ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) up to a characteristic width @xmath43 .",
    "this width @xmath43 is defined as the standard deviation of the final coastline depth .",
    "more precisely , defined @xmath58 as the mean number of points of the front lying on the line @xmath59 , and @xmath60 as the average position of the front , that is @xmath61 then @xmath43 is @xmath62    the ( averaged ) time evolution of @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( left ) .",
    "the dynamics depends strongly on the value of @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is large enough the dynamics is rapid and the erosion stops on an irregular but non - fractal sea - shore ( see the _ strong coupling _",
    "case @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . on the opposite , if @xmath27 is small enough , the dynamics last much longer and it finally stops on a fractal sea - shore ( _ weak coupling _",
    "case ) . note that the final values of the sea - power are different from the classical percolation threshold .",
    "this is linked to the weakening rule implemented in the model .",
    "it is however important to stress that the time here is a computer step , not directly comparable with physical time .",
    "a unit of computer step corresponds to the duration between erosion events .",
    "such a duration is _ directly related to the strength or fragility of the coast itself_.      of course , the real dynamics of the coasts are more complex than the _ `` rapid '' _ processes considered above .",
    "they result from the interplay with the slow weathering processes , generally attributed to carbonation or hydrolysis  @xcite .",
    "these processes act on longer , geological , time scales .    in order to mimic this long term evolution after the ending of _ `` rapid '' _ erosion ,",
    "the lithology parameter @xmath31 of all the coast sites is decreased by a small fraction @xmath64 , _ i.e. _ @xmath65 with @xmath66 after the erosion has stopped at @xmath56 .",
    "one or a few coast sites then become weaker than @xmath57 and they are eroded .",
    "this exposes new sites , previously protected , to erosion , triggering possibly a new start of the rapid erosion dynamics up to a next arrest .",
    "this process can then be iterated .",
    "snapshots of the coastline at successive arrest times are shown in fig .",
    "[ slow ] together with their measured fractal dimension .",

    "[ fig3 ] right ) . in the language of coastal studies  @xcite",
    ", the system state evolves through a dynamical equilibrium where small perturbations may stimulate large fluctuations and avalanche dynamics .",
    "the coastal engineering community has recently suggested the use of a stochastic description of the dynamics of rocky coast erosion , characterized by episodic , discontinuous events , more than simple constant erosion rate processes  @xcite .",
    "field inspections  @xcite confirmed that the local variability in rock resistances , or in general `` geological contingency influences the nature and scale of erosion processes and thresholds ''  @xcite .    in our model",
    "such fluctuating dynamics is due to the underlying criticality of percolation systems .",
    "a detailed statistical analysis of the episodic erosion events is out of the scope of the present paper . nevertheless , we wish to point out that the statistics of such events should follow power laws ( similarly to what has been computed for the etching of disordered solids at low temperature  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , power laws have been observed in the statistics of field coastal soft - cliff erosion  @xcite . in  @xcite , using a high temporal resolution rockfall statistics , the episodic character of the dynamics is debated , in opposition to a continuum activity . within our approach , a power law statistics is expected in the framework of percolation theory .",
    "note that the fluctuating dynamics of @xmath22 in our model , are not due to fluctuations of the sea incoming power @xmath28 .",
    "these could also be included , in order to mimic storms , for instance .",
    "such fluctuations could give raise to reactivations of fast eroding events , as for the weathering mechanism .",
    "in general , we do nt expect a change in the overall set of morphologies generated by the model .",
    "as explained above , our model of coastal erosion shows how the feedback between the lithology heterogeneity of shores and the damping effect of geometric irregularity may lead , in the weak coupling case , the coast towards a fractal geometric shape with a dimension characteristic of percolation .",
    "this case can be qualified as `` canonic '' since it corresponds to well established percolation theory results .",
    "however , under different conditions , the model may generate coastlines with complex irregular shapes , not necessarily fractal .",
    "this happens in the case of strong coupling morphology of `` old coasts '' , or in the case of transient morphologies of the weak coupling `` young coasts '' .",
    "a measure that can result useful to characterize the morphology in this case is the following .",
    "first , one has to recall that the exponent which plays a role in the geometry is that of the accessible perimeter , namely @xmath0 .",

    "up to now , the results described here where obtained under the assumption that sediments play no role , either because they do not modify damping on the surface , either because they disappear by a rapid transport effect .",
    "there exists , indeed , situations in which sediment transport can be neglected .",
    "see , for instance , the discussion in chapt .",
    "18 in  @xcite .",
    "however , when sediments stay on site , they can produce two different effects in terms of rock erosion ( the role of sediments produced by erosion as determinant for shaping sediment rich shorelines , which has witnessed recent modeling efforts  @xcite , is not discussed here ) .",
    "first if they are small enough they can play the role of little hammers accelerated by the waves . on the opposite they can fall on the sea floor and contribute to the damping of waves .",
    "to simplify , the small pieces increase erosion while the large heavy pieces increase damping .",
    "the erosion increase has been neglected here because its role should be only transitory .    now , suppose , in an extreme scenario , that the damping is not dominated , as was assumed above , by the interaction with the coast perimeter but by the damping effect of the sediments . in fact , it is known , and however poorly understood , that the shore waves are partially damped by their interaction with the sea floor . in first approximation , the more sediments the more damping .",
    "this means that the equivalent quality factor would be inversely proportional to the total amount of eroded material at time @xmath25 that me call @xmath89 , rather than to the coast perimeter length . in that case",
    "the erosion power would evolve as @xmath90 where the factor @xmath91 measures the relative contribution to damping of accumulated sediments shore as compared with the total damping .",
    "it might also take care of the fraction of the sediments transported away from the coast .",
    "in particular erosion of very high cliffs , producing large amounts of heavy rubble , would consequently induce a strong coupling effect , leading to rugged but not fractal sea shores .",
    "note that this damping mechanism , in which the eroding force decreases with the amount of eroded mass , leads to a one to one correspondence with the aluminum corrosion experiments and models mentioned above  @xcite ( where the corrosive power decreases with the amount of corroded material ) .",
    "then , the theory developed there , which again makes connection to gradient percolation , applies also in our case .",
    "this means that erosion will lead also to fractal or scaling interfaces with the sames scaling geometries .",
    "the two mechanisms may occur simultaneously , giving @xmath92 , without affecting the result : more generally we expect that any model that express some kind of link between random erosion and increased damping would lead to the same type of self - organized fractality or scaling .",
    "the analysis presented in section  [ sec : singular ] , suggests that the coastal morphology is not the sole reflect of the inland morphology . before discussing specific examples in detail one",
    "should recall that other phenomenon are known to play a role .",
    "for example sand deposits usually smooth the irregularity of rocky coasts , filling bays , or may display specific patterns  @xcite .",
    "also the rough geometry of glacial valleys gives the very convoluted coastline typical of fjords at large absolute latitudes .",
    "note also that our model has used implicitly the fact that the power giving rise to wave excitation was uniform .",
    "of course this may be not true on a too large scale ( think for instance to different wind or current conditions ) .    in this section",
    "we consider several specific locations , and we analyze the coastline fractal morphology , in comparison with the fractal geometry of the closest inland isolines .",
    "this is made possible by high resolution srtm3 data - set , which provide altimetric data of the earth surface in a grid of @xmath38 arc - seconds ( that is a resolution of about @xmath93 m ) and with a vertical error smaller than @xmath2 meters  @xcite .",
    "thanks to this new tools , it is possible to unfold the complexity of real coastline geometry , which is the result of the interplay of several physical phenomena , and , consequently might go beyond the simple model proposed here .    in the following field analysis , we restrict to coasts where there the terrain gradient at the coast is much larger than the average gradient in the inland , that is what we named plateau coasts , in section  [ sec : plateau ] .",

    "in particular , nonlinear damping effects , possibly including the role of turbulence , would modify the time history of erosion but not the scaling properties of the coast geometry .",
    "* once the coast is stabilized the long term evolution will be stochastic .",
    "it will be triggered even by small events and will produce some kind of avalanche statistics .",
    "this is related to the fact that a stabilized sea - shore may hide `` weak '' lithology regions or more fragile patches . * in the field , the islands which have resisted erosion under a power larger than the final power @xmath57 , should be stronger that the coast itself .",
    "this could be verified on the historical data of known seacoasts and the evolution of neighboring islands .    in summary ,",
    "the present work provides a rationale that connects damping , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrapods ] left , with rocky coast morphology , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetrapods ] right . a simple feedback mechanism that relates the large scale morphology with the sea wave erosion power ( usually noted with @xmath101 in the coastal literature  @xcite ) , together with a local variability of rock resistance ( @xmath102 ) , naturally lead to the formulation of our minimal model , which points out how both the irregular morphology of coastlines as well as the episodic and stochastic erosion dynamics may both be the effect of an underlying critical ( percolation ) point . of course , such a feedback process , does not exclude the existence of other processes acting at more local , or meso - scales  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our framework confirms the idea that the final coast emerges from a natural selection process , which eliminates the weaker part of the coast .",
    "the resulting shoreline constitutes a strong , but possibly fragile , barrier to sea erosion . to the extent that this idea applies",
    ", natural coasts should be `` preserved '' and managed with care .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge illuminating and fruitful discussions with jens feder and niels hovius , and alistair rowe for a reading of the manuscript .",
    "topographic data for earth have been obtained from the srtm30-plus set  @xcite .",
    "the data consists in the earth surface elevation over a grid of points .",
    "the resolution of the grid is @xmath35 minutes of degree for latitude and longitude , which corresponds , in the region of interest , to about four kilometers .",
    "we have extracted the coastline as the set of points at zero elevation .",
    "in fact , we use a generalized method to extract `` isolines '' at arbitrary elevation : to draw the isoline of level @xmath103 , we identify on the topographic grid all the nearest neighbor sites whose elevations , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , satisfying @xmath106 . using coordinates and elevations of such points , the coordinates of the isoline point",
    "are computed via a simple linear interpolation .",
    "once the isolines are found , the whole earth surface is divided in squares of @xmath9 degrees latitude x @xmath9 degrees longitude .",
    "in fact the square regions are separated by only two degrees as to have an overlapping covering of the total surface .",
    "then we proceed in computing the fractal dimension in each square , via the classical box counting procedure  @xcite : the fractal dimension @xmath107 has been measured through a least squares fit of the exponent of the box counting plot in the range of @xmath108 degrees , which roughly correspond to a range from few kilometers to several tenths of kilometers .",
    "we disregard fractal dimensions computed on isoline sets with less than @xmath109 points .",
    "the regression error in the fractal dimension @xmath107 so estimated never exceeded @xmath110 .",
    "the whole numerical analysis has been repeated in the following cases : ( i ) full resolution for continental land ( @xmath111 seconds instead of @xmath35 minutes ) ; ( ii ) different interpolation schemes for the definitions of isolines ; ( iii ) different minimum number of points ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the values of the corresponding measured fractal dimensions are only slightly affected , and the main results do not change .",
    "in order to relate the erosion model to the theory of percolation , we need to introduce the gradient percolation model ( * gp * )  @xcite . in this model , each site @xmath113 of the lattice is occupied with a probability which change linearly from @xmath32 to @xmath8 in a given direction @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is the size of the lattice in the @xmath59 direction ) .",
    "there is then a _ gradient _ in the occupation probability ( not to be confused with the terrain gradient in geomorphology ) .    in *",
    "gp * there is always an infinite cluster of occupied sites as there is a region where @xmath53 is larger than the standard percolation ( * sp * ) threshold @xmath54 .",
    "there is also an infinite cluster of empty sites as there is a region where @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "the object of interest is the * gp * front , i.e. the external limit ( or frontier ) of the infinite occupied cluster .",
    "this front is a random fractal object with @xmath116 but the accessible part of it is a random fractal with @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "it has an average position @xmath60 and a statistical width @xmath43 defined as follows . for @xmath117",
    ", @xmath118 is the mean number , per unit horizontal length , of points of the front lying on the line @xmath59 .",
    "it measures the front density at distance @xmath59 .",
    "the position @xmath60 and the width @xmath43 of the front are then defined in terms of the @xmath118 by  eq.[xfdef ] and  [ sigmadef ] .    it was found in  @xcite that the mean front is located at a distance where the density of occupation is very close to @xmath54 or @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the width @xmath43 depends on @xmath115 through a power law @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the correlation length exponent @xcite so that @xmath122 . the width @xmath43 was also shown to be a percolation correlation length  @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the fractal dimension of the accessible * gp * front coincide with the value measured in the erosion model .",
    "moreover , the width of the front scales with respect to the gradient exactly as the width of our coastlines do with respect to the parameter @xmath27 , i.e. through an exponent equal to @xmath123 .",
    "10 right )    the reason for this is that _",
    "@xmath27 is proportional to a gradient of occupation probability by the sea _ from the following argument . at time @xmath25",
    ", the erosion power is @xmath22 while the sea has eroded the earth up to an average depth @xmath124 , an increasing function of @xmath25 .",
    "inverting this function , @xmath125 can be written as @xmath126 .",
    "there exists then a spatial gradient of the occupation probability by the sea . for small enough @xmath27 one can write @xmath127 .",
    "the quantity @xmath128 is a function of @xmath27 but to the lowest order it is a constant independent of @xmath27 since even with @xmath129 , there will be an erosion due to randomness and a consequent perimeter evolution @xmath21 . then to lowest order , the real gradient @xmath130 is linear in @xmath27 , the coupling factor in the erosion model .",
