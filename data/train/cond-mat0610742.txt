    "for example , ligating the metal ions , or simply depositing the molecules on electrodes , can preferentially stabilize one state versus another .",
    "understanding the detailed molecular interactions responsible for binding metalloporphyrins to well - characterized metal surfaces is therefore a subject of great technological interest , one which has received extensive experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite study .",
    "memory and sensor applications of transition metal porphyrins rely on electrochemically - induced switching of the electronic and magnetic states.@xcite the field dependent self - assembly and mobility of porphyrin molecules on electrodes have also been the subject of experimental interest under ultra - high vacuum conditions@xcite and in solution.@xcite electric - field induced changes in the electronic states can lead to structural changes in porphyrin molecules , and this may impact their functions and reactivity in subtle ways.@xcite macrocycle conformational changes in nickel and zinc porphyrins have recently been the subject of a series of investigations.@xcite attaching ligands to ni(ii ) or photoexcitation can switch the low - spin nickel ground state with a @xmath2 configuration to the high - spin expanded @xmath3 state , so that core expansion causes the porphyrin ring to undergo a conformational change from a ruffled to a dome - like geometry . when outlying porphyrin appendages or bridles are attached to the ni porphyrins , this small but energetic motion triggered by nickel spin state changes",
    "can potentially be harvested as nanomechanical motion in molecular switches.@xcite it would be of great interest to extend this general principle to other transition metal porphyrins and related molecules deposited on gold electrodes . in such cases ,",
    "the transition metal charge or spin states can be altered by electrochemical means , and the resulting conformational changes can be monitored using atomic force microscopy .",
    "given the wide range of interest in porphyrins adsorbed on metal surfaces , it is important to elucidate the precise nature of metalloporphyrin adsorption on and interaction with metal electrodes .",
    "experimentally , it is known that certain substituted porphyrins and related molecules lie flat on au(111 ) surfaces.@xcite even when they contain bulky substitutents , the molecules are only slightly distorted from a planar adsorption geometry.@xcite it is also possible to have substituted porphyrins self - assembled into a tube - like geometry and lie edgewise on material surfaces if they are tethered using sulfide or other linkages.@xcite    density functional theory ( dft ) might appear to be the theoretical method of choice to shed light on the binding energies , spin states , geometries , and external electric field effects of porphyrins adsorbed on metal surfaces .",
    "dft simultaneously addresses the electronic and geometric properties of the composite molecule - metal system .",
    "it is a formally exact method , but the quality of its predictions depends on the approximate exchange correlation functional used .",
    "an early dft calculation@xcite was performed prior to detailed experimental studies of porphyrin adsorption on atomistically flat gold surfaces.@xcite ( for the purpose of this work , we ignore the herring - bone surface reconstruction on au(111),@xcite which occurs on long length - scales . ) motivated by molecular electronics experiments on self - assembled molecules which are somewhat similar to porphyrins,@xcite lamoen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite examined palladium porphines ( pdp ) adsorbed edgewise on au(111 ) , and reported a large , @xmath4  ev , binding energy .",
    "this calculation was performed using the local density approximation ( lda ) , which tends to overestimate the binding energy .",
    "a subsequent dft work@xcite considered pdp adsorbed in a similar edgewise geometry on al(111 ) surfaces .",
    "this study reported a sub ev adsorption energy using lda , and an even smaller binding energy using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite version of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange correlation functional .",
    "gga is generally more accurate than lda for treating molecule - material binding@xcite and has been widely used in such studies.@xcite    guided by recent experiments and building on these earlier dft results , one of the goals of this work is to apply the pbe functional to re - examine pdp adsorption on the au(111 ) surface .",
    "we consider both the flat adsorption geometry found in experiments where porphyrins are not tethered to metal surfaces,@xcite and the edgewise geometry adopted in earlier calculations .",
    "pdp can be considered a prototypical metalloporphyrin which adsorbs weakly on au(111 ) .",
    "for many transition metal compounds and materials , such as second row elements like pd , most implementations of dft appear to yield the correct ground spin state and electronic properties , and they are valuable techniques to apply.@xcite however , we are also interested in first row transition metal porphyrins ( e.g. , ni(ii ) and mn(ii ) , which are pertinent for studying effective ion size - driven conformational changes in porphyrin molecules).@xcite here we encounter a dilemma that has hindered dft studies of composite systems involving first row transition metal ions . in brief ,",
    "dft implementations with non - hybrid exchange correlation functionals such as pbe@xcite and pw91,@xcite widely used in the condensed matter physics community , treat gold and other metal surfaces accurately but are less accurate for interactions between ligand / crystal field and first row transition metal ions .",
    "the becke 3-parameter lee - yang - parr ( b3lyp)@xcite hybrid exchange correlation functional correctly predicts the high - spin ground state for mnp , but is at present too costly for modeling metal surfaces.@xcite    accurate predictions for bulk transition metals lattice constants and magnetic properties were among the early successes of non - hybrid gga.@xcite pw91 and pbe are among this class of gga .",
    "however , these functionals underestimate the exchange interaction among the strongly localized , partially filled @xmath5 orbitals in first row transition metal _ ions_. this leads to underestimation of the stability of high - spin states in some first row transition metal ions in impurity centers or ligand fields , where non - hybrid gga often predicts ground states with incorrect spin multiplicities.@xcite indeed , a recent _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation of mn(ii ) centers was compelled to apply a high - spin constraint throughout the trajectory.@xcite    hybrid exchange correlation functionals contain fractional non - local or hartree - fock exchange , which amounts to 20% for b3lyp.@xcite this admixture is apparently the right amount to reproduce the experimental spin ordering and energy splitting between spin states in many complexes between ligands and mn@xcite as well as other first row transition metal ions,@xcite and is widely and successfully used for mn centers.@xcite a slightly smaller admixture yields better results in other cases.@xcite at present , applying these hybrid functionals in simulation cells with periodic boundary condition is computationally costly  up to 100 times more so than for non - hybrid functionals.@xcite this factor may further depend on system size . as such , b3lyp",
    "has only seen preliminary applications in condensed phase systems.@xcite to our knowledge , it has not been applied to the large , slab - like , periodically replicated supercells needed to study porphyrin adsorption on metal surfaces,@xcite or for that matter , for large scale dft calculations that require periodic boundary conditions , such as in aqueous systems via _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics.@xcite as will be shown , periodically replicated simulation cells with adequate brillouin zone sampling are crucial for modeling porphyrin adsorption on gold surfaces .",
    "we note that hybrid functionals are not universally successful for all transition metal species .",
    "for example , ( 1 ) hybrid functionals tend to overestimate the stability of @xmath6 electronic configurations over @xmath7 ones in transition metal atoms.@xcite ( so does non - hybrid gga.@xcite ) this consideration does not play a role when the metal @xmath8-orbital is no longer available due to its involvement in doubly occupied bonding orbitals,@xcite or in mn(ii)p and mn(iii)p , which have largely empty mn @xmath9 orbitals . ( 2 ) the binding energies and bond lengths of many transition metal dimers are more accurately predicted using non - hybrid rather than hybrid gga.@xcite this issue may be related to ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , complexes with mn - mn bonds may be particularly challenging for hybrid functionals.@xcite ( 3 ) for as yet unknown reasons , b3lyp is ambiguous regarding the stability of the high - spin electronic configurations of some first row transition metal porphines , such as ligated fep,@xcite while non - hybrid gga performs considerably worse;@xcite a larger admixture of hartree - fock exchange seems necessary in this case .",
    "a promising alternative method to characterize the correct spin state is to use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods , which up to now have been used to study porphine ( h@xmath10p ) which lacks coordinated metal ions.@xcite another option is to impose the experimentally known spin polarization in the entire supercell.@xcite as will be discussed , however , this approach may not yield accurate metal - nitrogen distances within the porphyrin ring .",
    "furthermore , when a metal electrode is present , the bulk metal valence electrons can be excited to the conduction band to give arbitary spin multiplicities at negligible energy penalties .",
    "so , a global spin constraint will likely change the bulk metal magnetic behavior without affecting the adsorbed transition metal ion complex .",
    "clearly , new computational techniques are needed to treat porphyrin molecules adsorbed on metals .    in this work ,",
    "we apply the dft+u method@xcite to treat the composite manganese porphine - gold metal system .",
    "this method , which emphasizes the role of on - site screened coulomb interactions , has successfully predicted the correct electronic ground state for transition metal oxide crystals such as nio@xcite and lacoo@xmath11,@xcite where traditional non - hybrid gga has failed .",
    "this mean field approach augments the dft exchange correlation interactons _ among electrons in a subset of orbitals _",
    "( mn @xmath5 in our case ) with hartree - fock - like interactions parameterized with coulomb ( @xmath12 ) and exchange ( @xmath13 ) terms .",
    "electrons in these orbitals still interact with the rest of the system ( including the c , h , n atoms in the porphine ring and the au(111 ) substrate ) via the dft formalism .",
    "the specific implementation we use is described in more detail in the supporting information section .",
    "formally speaking , the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to coulomb and exchange integrals.@xcite in practice , @xmath12 has been set at values required to achieve agreement with experiments.@xcite when dealing with molecules embedded with transition metal ions , we propose that @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be fitted to either experiments or predictions via other gas phase theoretical methods such as high level quantum chemistry , quantum monte carlo , and hybrid functional dft  as long as the latter are known to agree with experiments .",
    "the dft+u technique is readily amenable to periodically replicated simulation cells , and is thus well suited for studying metal porphine molecules adsorbed on gold surfaces .",
    "we note that this method is empirical in nature , and it assumes that correlation between the @xmath5 electron can be approximated as static.@xcite nevertheless , it has seen wide and successful applications to many solid state materials where lda / gga treatments fail for electronic / magnetic properties.@xcite it may also become a general technique for _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics study of first row transition metal centers in condensed phases.@xcite    as a proof of principle , we will focus on a second prototype porphyrin : manganese ( ii ) porphine ( mnp ) .",
    "mnp exhibits behavior drastically different from that of pdp discussed above .",
    "pdp is umambigously stable in the low spin state , and pbe and dft+u methods yield similar predictions .",
    "however , mn(ii ) complexes in general and mn(ii ) porphyrins in particular are known to have high - spin ground states.@xcite we will show that pbe incorrectly predicts the intermediate spin state to be the mnp ground state . on the other hand , by fitting @xmath12 to b3lyp results ( which yield the experimental high spin ground state ) , both the high / intermediate spin energy splitting and the gas phase mnp geometry are successfully reproduced using the dft+u method.@xcite    having validated the dft+u technique for isolated mnp , we further apply it to investigate the geometric , electronic , and magnetic properties of mnp adsorbed on au(111 ) surfaces .",
    "we also examine the effect of an electric field on the adsorbed mnp , and show that it can induce significant changes in these properties .",
    "the mnp structure is particularly strongly affected by the applied field , with the mn - n distance in the porphine ring increasing by 0.13   .",
    "this suggests that mn porphyrins may exhibit conformational changes related to those seen for ni porphyrins.@xcite    to summarize , we have conducted a comprehensive study of the adsorption of two prototype transition metal porphine molecules , pdp and mnp , on gold surfaces .",
    "the effect of an applied electric field on the properties of adsorbed mnp is investigated .",
    "we also emphasize the success and importance of applying the dft+u technique to treat the first row transition metal ion mn(ii ) , and conjecture that this technique may be widely applicable to condensed phase systems .",

    "we find there is at most a transfer of 0.2  electron from mnp to the substrate , despite the drastic changes in the dos and the spin multiplicity from their gas phase values .",
    "the binding between mnp and au(111 ) is thus best described as covalent or metallic .",
    "given that the mnp - au(111 ) interaction is associated with partial electron transfer , we expect that changing the electric potential on the gold substrate will strongly influence the adsorption behavior .",
    "an electric field which favors transfer of electrons from mnp to au can strengthen the mnp - au interaction .",
    "an electric field which favors electron transfer back into mnp @xmath5 orbitals should cause the mn(iii)-like behavior to revert back to mn(ii ) .    applying electric fields within plane wave",

    "@xmath34-point sampling is used throughout .",
    "table  [ table5 ] shows that a 0.7  v /  electric field strongly reduces the binding energy and changes the magnetic moment to almost its isolated mnp value : @xmath35@xmath36 according to dft+u predictions , compared with @xmath37@xmath36 in isolated mnp .",
    "the mn - n distance , @xmath27 , also increases from the zero field value of 2.02   to 2.15 , which is even larger than the value of @xmath38 predicted in isolated mnp .",
    "the pbe predictions for molecular geometry and spin states are substantially different ; this reflects the inability of pbe to predict the correct spin state and molecular geometry for isolated mnp .",
    "the larger mn - n distance in adsorbed mnp in an electric field compared to isolated mnp is due to the significant mn ion displacement out of the porphine plane towards the gold substrate , and not to a change in the porphine conformation , which remains essentially planar .",
    "this is demonstrated by the similar core sizes for isolated mnp ( 2.090   ) and for mnp adsorbed on au(111 ) with an electric field ( 2.087   ) ( the core size is defined as the radius of a cylinder which can fit through the porphine hole ) .",
    "nsd analysis ( supporting information ) also shows that the a@xmath39 ( in - plane ) deformation of mnp on au(111 ) in the absence of an applied field is consistent with a mn(iii)-like species , with a a@xmath39 deformation of + 0.08   compared to + 0.11   predicted for isolated mnclp .",
    "as expected , with an applied electric field of 0.7  v /  , the first order a@xmath39 deformation of + 0.31   is similar to that predicted for isolated mnp ( + 0.37   ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the effect of the applied field on the charge density .",
    "the field evidently repopulates the mn @xmath40-like orbital and restores electron density to the top side of the mnp molecule .",
    "there still appears substantial electron cloud overlap between mnp and the gold surface despite the small @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig5]d depicts the induced charge differential . note",
    "that the field causes both the surface top site au atom and the mn ion to move towards the gold substrate , whereas the electron densities on both atoms are displaced in the opposite direction .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] plots the electronic dos predicted by dft+u in the applied field . compared with the zero field case ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , the occupied states are shifted to lower energies relative to the fermi level . in particular ,",
    "the highest lying orbital with substantial mn @xmath5 character is brought below the fermi level in the mnp - au(111 ) complex , and is occupied by electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the field induced change in the total magnetic moment .",
    "nevertheless , if we demarcate the charge density at the narrowest region of the electron cloud between au and mn , once again we find a small , @xmath1 electron difference between the total charge on mnp and au with or without the electric field .",
    "thus , while the charge and spin state of the mn ion differ , the locus of the total electron density is not strongly affected .",
    "the 4-layer bare gold slab is stable in the 0.7  v /  field , and the field - induced change in its energy is proportional to the square of the field magnitude .",
    "we find that smaller , 0.525  v /  and 0.35  v electric fields lead to similar behavior described for mnp adsorbed on gold in a 0.7v / a field , although the mn - n bonds becomes shorter ( 2.109 and 2.102   , respectively ) .",
    "due to the technical difficulty of converging a dft+u calculation in a system with spin polarization , a zero band gap , and an electric field , we have not located the minimal field needed to trigger this switching .",
    "this will be investigated in a future work .",
    "these calculations are performed in vacuum , and we have not attempted to relate the field strength to an electrostatic potential . in electrochemical cells , where the molecules and electrodes are immersed in electrolytes , the voltage difference required to reduce mn(iii ) porphyrins to mn(ii ) is much smaller : about 0.4  volt in water,@xcite and on the order of 0.2 - 0.3  volt in organic solvents.@xcite",
    "in this work , we use a combination of density functional theory ( dft ) in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the dft+u technique to study the adsorption of transition metal porphine molecules on atomistically flat au(111 ) substrates .",
    "the pbe exchange correlation functional is adequate for treating palladium porphine ( pdp ) .",
    "we find that pdp preferentially adsorbs flat on au(111 ) surfaces , in agreement with experimental observations of substituted porphyrins lying flat on gold surfaces.@xcite the binding energy is 0.27  ev , irrespective of the adsorption site .",
    "there is no charge transfer or covalent bonding between pdp and au , and the interaction is predominantly dispersive .",
    "in contrast to a previous dft calculation,@xcite we find that a self - assembled tube - like geometry with the pdp adsorbing edgewise on au(111 ) is not energetically favorable . using multiple dft codes and types of pseudopotentials , we find that the lda binding energy for this edgewise adsorption geometry is 0.25  ev , not @xmath4  ev as previously predicted.@xcite the pbe exchange correlation functional predicts little or no binding . furthermore , an accurate binding energy for this geometry requires more extensive brillouin zone sampling than has been attempted in the literature .",
    "the behavior of manganese porphine ( mnp ) is qualitatively different .",
    "the pbe exchange correlation functional does not reproduce the correct ground state ( high spin @xmath41 state ) or the experimental mn - nitrogen distance .",
    "however , pbe can be augmented with the dft+u technique , which can be parameterized to yield the correct ordering of spin multiplicity .",
    "the dft+u ground state geometry exhibits a mn - n distance in good agreement with experiments and b3lyp predictions .",
    "mnp selectively binds to the top site of au(111 ) .",
    "when we use mn(ii)p as the reference state , the binding energy of mnp on au(111 ) is significantly larger than for pdp .",
    "the adsorbed mnp exhibits partial charge transfer from orbitals with substantial mn @xmath42 character to au(111 ) states .",
    "the overall magnetic moment also changes from @xmath37@xmath36 ( @xmath41 ) to @xmath43@xmath36 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "in other words , mn takes on a + 3 oxidiation state character .",
    "this mnp - au(111 ) interaction can be partially reversed by applying an electric field with the appropriate polarity .",
    "a sufficiently large field causes the mn ion to revert back to a mn(ii)-like spin state , resulting in a significant , up to 0.13   , increase in the mn - n distance within the porphine ring .",
