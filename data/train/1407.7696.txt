    "the draconid meteor shower , almost unnoticeable in most years , produced intense meteor storms in 1933 and 1946 as well as outbursts in 1985 and 1998 @xcite and moderate activity in some other years , e.g.  2005 @xcite .",
    "the parent body of the shower is the jupiter family comet 21p / giacobini - zinner .",
    "the mechanism of the outbursts is now well understood , which allowed the prediction of another outburst on october 8 , 2011 @xcite .",

    "@xcite gave also the abundances of minor elements but their values are based on low resolution and noisy spectra and can not be considered as reliable .",
    "another aspect is the temporal evolution of the spectra .",
    "the previous studies @xcite noted a shift of the na line toward higher altitudes in some draconids .",

    "interestingly , our two best spectra 4 and 6 are quite different in this respect ( figs .",
    "[ 4spectra ] and [ sodium ] ) .",
    "meteor 4 is a pronounced example of the early start and early end of the sodium line .",
    "the maximum of na is shifted up by about 5 km in comparison with mg . in meteor 6 , na is present along the whole trajectory in nearly constant proportion to mg . though both meteoroids had almost the same initial mass ( table  [ meteors ] ) , the heights of the maxima and the shapes of the light curves were also quite different ( figs .",
    "[ lc ] and [ sodium ] ) .",
    "meteor 4 had a flat maximum around height 95 km , while meteor 6 exhibited a bright flare at a much lower height of 83 km .",
    "all these facts suggest that the meteoroid structure may be different .",
    "in order to get more insight into the structure of the meteoroids , we evaluated their decelerations along the trajectory .",
    "in fact , the directly measured quantity is the position of the meteor as a function of time ( or frame number ) . of course , individual position measurements are subject to error . moreover ,",
    "once fragmentation starts , the meteor is no longer a point - like object .",
    "as drag depends on mass , grains of different sizes separate along the meteor s direction of travel to form a streak of light @xcite .",
    "as the fragmentation and ablation proceeds , different parts of the streak may become the brightest part .",
    "this effect may lead to large scatter of apparent deceleration / acceleration from frame to frame .",
    "thus , as a first step , we evaluated the lag of each meteor along its trajectory .",
    "the lag at any time is defined as the difference between the predicted meteor position in case of zero deceleration ( i.e.  considering only the initial position and velocity ) and the actual position .",
    "since the time is a relative quantity for each meteor , meteors are best compared by the lag as a function of predicted height .",
    "the predicted height is the height as it would be without deceleration .",
    "kg , bulk density 200 kg m@xmath21 ( diameter 1 cm ) , ablation coefficient 0.02 s@xmath22km@xmath23 and zenith angle 22@xmath0 .",
    "meteor 6 showed less deceleration because it was more massive . ]    the comparison of the lag of meteors 4 and 6 is given in fig .",
    "we can see that the lag ( and thus the deceleration ) was much larger for meteor 4 than for meteor 6 .",
    "this is another substantial difference between these two meteors , besides the shape of the light curve and the release of sodium , and again suggests differences in structure and fragmentation history .",
    "the erosion model , described in detail by @xcite , can provide further insight into the causes of the differences between individual draconid meteors .",
    "the model assumes that a gradual continuous release of individual grains , from which the meteoroid is composed , starts at a certain height , after the meteoroid received a certain amount of energy per unit surface from the collisions with atmospheric molecules .",
    "after the release , each grain behaves as an individual meteor .",
    "the grain density is assumed to be 3000 kg m@xmath21 .",
    "the bulk density of the whole meteoroids can be much lower due to high porosity .",
    "the rate of the grain release is described by the erosion coefficient , @xmath24 .",
    "the rate of ablation ( vaporization ) of both the grains and the whole meteoroid is described by the ablation coefficient , @xmath25 .",
    "the erosion may proceed in several ( usually two ) stages , i.e.  the initial erosion may be applied only to a certain percentage of the meteoroid , while the rest continues unaffected ( only subject to ablation ) for some more time .",
    "the parameters of the erosion model are adjusted to fit the light curve in white light and the lag in the trajectory .    to provide some deceleration data , we smoothed the lag data fits obtained with the erosion model @xcite and plotted the corresponding decelerations in fig .",

    "meteoroids 1 and 6 were characterized by much slower grain release , so that the erosion was finished only at heights much lower than 90 km . moreover , about 1/6 of both meteoroids did not participate in the initial erosion and resisted fragmentation to lower heights ( 84 and 83 km , respectively ) .",

    "we can see that meteor 6 was still nearly point - like at the height of 92.5 km and only slightly elongated at 90.5 km . at 84.5 km ,",
    "the meteor head was quite concentrated again but there was a faint wake seen in the maia camera , about 2 km long . at 82 km , both the head and",
    "the wake became longer . at 79 km ,",
    "the wake was more than 6 km long but the meteor head was still well defined .",
    "meteor 4 was clearly elongated in the low resolution maia image already at the height of 92 km and the elongation increased with time . at lower heights , the meteor became a streak of light without any head .",
    "these differences are consistent with our interpretation that meteoroid 4 quickly disintegrated into grains , which dispersed along the trajectory .",
    "meteoroid 6 fragmented more slowly and in two stages .",
    "we note that the long wake may not have been caused only by the ablating grains , since draconids also exhibit persistent trains @xcite whose radiation is driven by different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "we have combined spectroscopy , photometry , dynamics and morphology of draconid meteors to study physical and chemical properties of the meteoroids from comet 21p / giacobini - zinner .",
    "the meteoroids were somewhat larger ( sizes 1  3 cm ) than the majority of meteoroids from our previous draconid study @xcite .",
    "the spectra were not available in the previous study , except for one bright draconid .",
    "meteors 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 had some common characteristics : smooth and flat light curves without any flares , high decelerations , and the release of most sodium in the first half of their trajectories ( at least meteors 4 , 7 , 8  we do not have complete spectrum of meteor 2 ) .",
    "all these features can be explained by the complete and quick disintegration of the meteoroids into small grains . in our model",
    ", the disintegration was finished at the height of 93 km or larger for all four meteors . at the disintegration end height ,",
    "almost all the sodium had evaporated .",
    "we believe that the reason was that the grains were small enough to release sodium and potassium from their whole volumes earlier than the other elements were vaporized , an effect called differential ablation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , sodium may be part of a hypothetical glue which holds the grains together @xcite .",
    "meteors 1 and 6 exhibited flares at relatively low heights 8483 km , where other draconids had nearly disappeared .",
    "the deceleration of meteoroids 1 and 6 was much lower and sodium was present along the whole trajectories .",
    "our analysis suggests that their bulk density was not very different from the meteoroids of the previous group and their fragmentation started at similar heights or only somewhat lower .",
    "the main difference was that either the grain release was much slower or they fragmented in a somewhat different manner .",
    "moreover , significant parts of the meteoroids ( 1/6 of mass in both cases ) resisted the fragmentation until heights of 8483 km .",
    "here they disrupted abruptly causing the meteor flares .",
    "these more compact parts contained significant sodium and the sodium was radiated out efficiently during the flares ( see fig .",
    "[ sodium ] ) .",
    "it is possible that mechanical strength of the material was exceeded at these heights , where the dynamic pressure reached 5 kpa .",
    "this would still mean a quite low mechanical strength in comparison with most non - draconid meteoroids @xcite .",
    "meteoroids 3 and 5 were intermediate cases . the light curves and the sodium release pattern were similar to meteors 1 and 6 but the decelerations were higher and the flares occurred at larger altitudes .",
    "meteoroid 3 was particularly complex since it exhibited three stages of erosion / fragmentation .",
    "we note that meteors 1 and 2 , which may have come from an older ejection event than the others , have very different characteristics , and are each more similar to meteors from the main peak than to each other .",
    "this fact suggests that the differences found among the meteoroids reflect the inhomogeneity of the cometary material and not the exposure age in space .",
    "we analyzed eight moderately bright draconid meteors .",
    "some of the most precise trajectories and orbits of the 2011 draconids were provided .",
    "the main purpose of this work was , nevertheless , to study the physical and chemical properties of draconid meteoroids .",
    "our data are consistent with the known fact that draconids are porous conglomerates of grains and the abundance ratios of the main elements ( mg , fe , na ) are chondritic .",
    "nevertheless , significant differences in fragmentation behavior of cm - sized draconids were found .",
    "various textures with various resistance to atmospheric fragmentation clearly exist among draconid meteoroids and even within single meteoroids .",
