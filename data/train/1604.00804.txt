    "this paper deals with the global dynamics of nonlinear parabolic systems of the form @xmath4 where time variable @xmath5 and space variable @xmath6",
    "are real , spatial domain is the whole real line , the function @xmath7 takes its values in @xmath8 with @xmath9 a positive integer , @xmath10 is a fixed @xmath11 positive definite symmetric real matrix , and the nonlinearity is the gradient of a scalar _ potential _ function @xmath12 , which is assumed to be regular ( of class at least @xmath13 ) and coercive at infinity ( see hypothesis in ) .",
    "the main feature of system  [ init_syst ] is that it can be recast , at least formally , as the gradient flow of an energy functional .",
    "if @xmath14 is a pair of vectors of @xmath8 , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the usual euclidean scalar product and the usual euclidean norm , and let @xmath17 denote the scalar product associated to @xmath10 and the corresponding norm , respectively .",
    "if @xmath7 is a solution of  [ init_syst ] , the _ energy _ ( or _ lagrangian _ or _ action _ ) functional of the solution reads : @xmath18 = \\eee[x\\mapsto u(x , t ) ] = \\int_{\\rr } \\bigl(\\frac{\\abs{u_x(x , t)}_{\\ddd } ^2}{2}+v\\bigl(u(x , t)\\bigr)\\bigr)\\,dx \\,.\\ ] ] its time derivative reads , at least formally , @xmath19 = -\\int_{\\rr }",
    "\\abs{u_t(x , t)}^2\\,dx \\le 0\\,,\\ ] ] and system  [ init_syst ] can formally be rewritten as : @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ]    if system  [ init_syst ] is considered on a _ bounded _ spatial domain with boundary conditions that preserve this gradient structure , then the integrals in  [ form_en ] and  [ d_form_en_dt ] converge , thus the system is really  and not only formally  of gradient type . in this case",
    "the dynamics is ( at least from a qualitative point of view ) fairly well understood , up to a fine description of the global attractor that is compact and made of the unstable manifolds of stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "according to lasalle s principle , every solution approaches the set of stationary solutions ( and even a single stationary solution if the potential is analytic , @xcite ) .",
    "if space is the whole real line and the solutions under consideration are only assumed to be bounded , then the gradient structure above is only formal and allows a much richer phenomenology ( the full attractor is far from being fully understood in this case , see the introduction of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a salient feature is the occurrence of travelling fronts , that is travelling waves connecting homogeneous equilibria at both ends of space .",
    "those solutions are known to play a major role in the asymptotic behaviour of `` many '' initial conditions ; roughly speaking they are two classes of them , depending on the nature of the invaded equilibrium : monostable fronts , where an unstable equilibrium is replaced by a stable one , and bistable fronts , where the invaded equilibrium also is stable .",
    "a reasonably wide class of solutions , sufficiently large to capture the convergence to travelling fronts while limiting the complexity of the dynamics encountered is made of solutions that are close to homogeneous equilibria at both ends of space , at least for large times . and among such solutions the simplest case is that of _ bistable _ solutions , when those equilibria at both ends of space are stable .    in the late seventies ,",
    "substantial breakthroughs have been achieved by p. c. fife and j. b. mcleod about the global behaviour of such _",
    "bistable _ solutions in the _ scalar _ case ( @xmath9 equals @xmath21 ) .",
    "their results comprise global convergence towards a bistable front @xcite , global convergence towards a `` stacked family of bistable fronts '' @xcite , and finally , in the case of a bistable potential , a rather complete description of the global asymptotic behaviour of all solutions that are sufficiently close , at infinity in space , to the local ( non global ) minimum point @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper , together with the companion papers @xcite , is to make a step further in this program , by extending those results to the case of _ systems _ , and by providing for such systems a complete description of the asymptotic behaviour of all bistable solutions ( under generic hypotheses on the potential @xmath3 ) .",
    "concerning the nature of the arguments involved in the proofs , the main difference with respect to fife and mcleod s approach is the fact that the maximum principle does not hold any more for systems .",
    "it turns out , though , that a purely variational approach is sufficient to recover the results obtained by these authors , exploiting the fact that a gradient structure similar to the one above exists in every travelling referential ( though only in the case where the diffusion matrix @xmath10 is the identity matrix , unfortunately ) .",
    "observe by the way that this gradient structure in every travelling referential was already mentioned and used by fife and mcleod in their seminal ( initial ) paper @xcite of 1977 ( see p. 350 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the global behaviour of every bistable solution is as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) : each of the two spatially homogeneous equilibria at the ends of space may ( or not ) be invaded by a bistable travelling front , which may itself be followed by a second one ( at a speed that is not larger than the one of the first front ) , and so on .",
    "each of these travelling fronts replaces a ( local ) minimum point of the potential by another where the value of the potential is lower .",
    "since the potential is bounded from below , the number of fronts in these two `` stacked families '' ( one at each end of space ) is finite ( and by the way possibly zero ) .",
    "the two equilibria left behind the `` last '' front of each of these two families must belong to the same level set of the potential , and behind these `` last '' fronts , the solution relaxes towards the set of stationary solutions that are homoclinic or heteroclinic to critical points  they will be assumed to be ( local ) minimum points  in this level set .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to treat ( only ) the `` relaxation '' part of this program . to be more explicit ,",
    "it is to describe the asymptotic behaviour of bistable solutions connecting ( local ) minimum points in the same level set of the potential and having a ( properly localized ) energy that remains bounded from below ( that is , for which the equilibria at both ends of space are _ not _ `` invaded '' by travelling fronts ) . as a consequence , the gradient structure in travelling frames will not be required .",
    "there is a huge amount of literature about relaxation of solutions for systems like  [ init_syst ] .",
    "a tremendous work was achieved to obtain precise quantitative information about the approach to stationary solutions and the metastable dynamics ( `` dormant instability '' ) resulting from the long range interaction between these ( spatially localized ) stationary solutions .",
    "often , this has been done on the simplest possible models exhibiting these phenomena ( like the allen - cahn equation ) , often in the scalar case @xmath9 equals @xmath21 , with the use of the maximum principle , sometimes on a bounded domain ( and also by the way often in higher space dimension ) , often for a potential taking only nonnegative values , and often for solutions of finite energy .",
    "the papers of s .-",
    "ei @xcite and f. bthuel , g. orlandi , and d. smets @xcite  both especially relevant with respect to the present work  contain a more complete list of references together with short historical reviews .",
    "the purpose of this paper is more modest , since the results that will be proved are purely qualitative ( they only concern the asymptotic dynamics after an arbitrarily long interval of time for which no quantitative estimate will be given ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypotheses we will have to deal with ( in relation with the purpose of describing in @xcite the global dynamics of all bistable solutions ) are slightly more general than those usually made in the literature mentioned above .",
    "besides the fact that no maximum principle is available for systems and that the set of stationary solutions is a priori unknown , we must consider potentials that may take negative values and solutions for which expression  [ form_en ] of energy ( integral on the whole real line ) may be infinite .",
    "the difficulties to overcome are thus to control the behaviour of bistable solutions at both ends of space ( in a way sufficient to ensure an approximate decrease of a localized energy ) , and to prove convergence towards the set of stationary solutions that are homoclinic or heteroclinic to homogeneous equilibria without any a priori information about this set .",
    "the results ( [ thm : relax , thm : patt_disc ] below ) are eventually nothing but a purely qualitative ( thus weaker ) version of many well - known results on more specific examples or with more specific hypotheses , especially if compared with the results proved by bthuel , orlandi , and smets in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the uniformly local sobolev space @xmath23 ( its definition is recalled in [ subsec : funct_fram ] ) .",
    "this space is the most convenient with respect to estimates on the localized energy and localized @xmath24-norm of the solutions that are used along the paper .",
    "however , due to the smoothing properties of system  [ init_syst ] , the choice of the functional framework is not crucial , and every statement remains true if @xmath22 denotes , instead of @xmath23 , the more familiar banach space @xmath25 of functions of class @xmath26 that are uniformly bounded together with their first derivative .",
    "accordingly , it is within the functional framework @xmath27 that the statements are the least sensitive to regularization properties , and thus most appropriate to further generalizations to a wider class of systems , for instance hyperbolic systems ( see [ subsubsec : damp_hyp ] ) .",
    "system  [ init_syst ] defines a local semi - flow in @xmath22 ( see for instance d. b. henry s book @xcite ) .",
    "let us assume that the potential function @xmath12 is of class @xmath28 with @xmath29 not smaller than @xmath30 ( see [ subsec : glob_exist ] ) , and is strictly coercive at infinity in the following sense :    : :    @xmath31    ( or in other words there exists a positive quantity @xmath32 such that the quantity @xmath33 is larger than @xmath34 as soon as @xmath35 is sufficiently large ) .    according to this hypothesis , the semi - flow of system  [ init_syst ] is actually global , in other words solutions",
    "are defined up to @xmath36 in time ( details are given in [ subsec : glob_exist ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath37 this semi - flow .",
    "then , for every @xmath38 in @xmath22 , the solution corresponding to the initial data @xmath38 reads : @xmath39 and is defined for all @xmath6 in @xmath40 and @xmath5 in @xmath41 .",
    "our targets are bistable solutions , let us define them formally . in the definition",
    "below and everywhere in this paper , the term `` minimum point '' denotes a point where a function  namely the potential @xmath3  reaches a local _ or _ global minimum , and the adjective `` nondegenerate '' means ( for a minimum point ) that the hessian matrix of the function at this point is positive definite .    a solution @xmath7 of system  [ init_syst ] is called a _ bistable solution _ if there are two ( possibly equal ) nondegenerate minimum points @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the potential @xmath3 such that the quantities : @xmath44 both approach @xmath45 when time approaches @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , such a solution is called a _ bistable solution connecting @xmath42 to @xmath43 _ ( see [ fig : bist_sol ] ) .     to @xmath43.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a function @xmath38 in @xmath22 is called a _ bistable initial condition ( connecting @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) _ if the solution of system  [ init_syst ] corresponding to this initial condition is a bistable solution ( connecting @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote two nondegenerate minimum points ( possibly equal ) of the potential @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the subset of @xmath22 made of bistable initial conditions connecting @xmath42 to @xmath43 .    by construction ,",
    "this set is positively invariant under the semi - flow of system  [ init_syst ] .",
    "it will be proved in [ sec : spat_asympt ] ( [ cor : bist ] ) that it is nonempty , open in @xmath22 ( for the usual norm on this function space ) , and that it contains all functions sufficiently close to the minimum points @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the ends of space .      in this paper , only bistable solutions connecting minimum points in the same level set of @xmath3 will be considered . for convenience , we will assume that this level set corresponds to the value @xmath45 .",
    "thus the following notation will be used : @xmath47 and the following `` normalization '' hypothesis will be made `` without loss of generality '' :    : :    there exists at least one nondegenerate minimum point of    @xmath3 in the level set @xmath48 . in other    words ,",
    "the set    @xmath49    is nonempty",
    ".    the following additional hypothesis will be required at various stages of the proofs .",
    "the question of whether this hypothesis is required for the validity of the results stated below will unfortunately not be answered in this paper ( for the reason that the author does not know the answer , see comments in [ subsubsec : uns_quest ] ) .    : :    all critical points of @xmath3 in the level set    @xmath48 are nondegenerate minimum points .",
    "in other    words , at every point of @xmath8 where both    @xmath3 and its gradient vanish , the hessian matrix of    @xmath3 is positive definite .",
    "note that for a generic potential @xmath3 satisfying the critical point are nondegenerate thus their number is finite and they belong to distinct level sets of @xmath3 , and as a consequence follows from .",
    "in practical examples it often occurs , however , that several critical points belong to the level set @xmath48 , but this follows in general from the existence of a symmetry for @xmath3 ( like in examples ( a ) and ( b ) of [ fig : shape_pot ] ) , so that these critical points have the same morse index ; thus in such cases again follows from .",
    "a stationary solution @xmath50 of system  [ init_syst ] is a function from @xmath40 to @xmath8 that is solution of the second order differential system in @xmath8 : @xmath51 or equivalently of the first order differential system in @xmath52 : @xmath53 which is a hamiltonian system . indeed ,",
