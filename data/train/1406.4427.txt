    "bachelard @xcite stresses that philosophy must submit to the teachings of science . as a physicist and a philosopher of science ,",
    "i am inspired by this point of view . in the following ,",
    "i am introducing a study of a relatively new field of physics , the quantum hall effects , and trying to extract some relevant philosophical view point from that study .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the first parts of this paper ( sections 2 to 5 ) are devoted to an elementary introduction to this field .",
    "section [ progress ] sets the historical stage which allowed for the appearance of the quantum hall effects ( hereafter qhe ) .",
    "section [ revo ] explains why the qhe qualify as a scientific revolution .",
    "section [ history ] specializes in the history of these effects , beginning with the classical one , and introducing some simple elements of theory for the motion of electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "subsections [ classic ] and [ ll ] deal , respectively , with the classical hall effect , ancestor of the qhe , and the basic quantum theory of electron dynamics in a magnetic field .",
    "subsection [ prelude ] describes the `` normal science '' prediction , published before experiments were conducted .",
    "the astonishing experimental discovery of the integer qhe @xcite ( hereafter iqhe ) , which seemed to refute qualitatively those theoretical expectations , is described in subsection [ klitz ] .",
    "subsection [ storm ] introduces the second revolutionary finding : the fractional qhe ( hereafter fqhe ) @xcite and briefly introduces the discoveries for which laughlin @xcite is responsible , such as fractional statistics and fractionally charged excitations ; a novel theoretical entity , composite fermions , is mentioned .",
    "it was introduced by jain @xcite as a development of laughlin s theory , to account for some experimental results which the latter did not explain .",

    "subsections [ topological ] and [ ferro ] introduce two new theoretical and experimental entities which are by - products of the qhe : the topological insulator and the quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "section [ fqh ] is devoted to the second quantum hall revolution : the experimental discovery @xcite and the theory of the fractional quantum hall effects ( hereafter fqhe ) also by laughlin @xcite ; subsection [ cf ] explains the main idea at the basis of the composite fermion proposal . in the last parts , ( section [ philo ] ) i will attempt to draw some philosophical inferences from the material described in the previous sections . in particular , i will discuss two versions of `` realism '' .",
    "first , i will spend some time discussing `` scientific realism '' , as developed by ian hacking ( section [ sr ] ) , in his book \" _ representing and intervening , introductory topics in the philosophy of natural science \" _ @xcite .",
    "hacking s views on the importance of practice in establishing truths about the world will be stressed ; this section contrasts hacking s views with those of dialectic materialism .",
    "section [ truth ] discusses the possibility of establishing truths about the world from hacking s point of view , in relation with the qhe .",

    "scientific pluralism is discussed in section [ pluralism ] ; section [ about ] discusses the qhe from the point of view of various other science philosophers . in section",
    "[ contradict ] , i discuss some of the relations this study may have with the question of the unity and struggle of opposites in nature , namely one of the thesis of dialectic materialism in nature .",
    "the conclusion lists the main results of this work ( section [ conclu ] ) .",
    "the discoveries of the iqhe in 1980 , and of the fqhe in 1982 , deal with an apparently restricted class of quantum phenomena : the behaviour of electronic systems in a two dimensional space under strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the two dimensional sample @xcite . what could we possibly learn about nature or about knowledge which could be of any universal interest ?",
    "this paper aims at offering some answers to this question .",
    "a first observation is that the developments which are the topic of this paper were made possible by progress in the physics of semi - conductors .",
    "the latter is an intimate mixture of theoretical and experimental progress , based in particular on the quantum mechanics of electrons in various pure and impure crystalline structures .    at the interface of two types of semi - conductors ,",
    "experimentalists have been able to create electron populations which are confined , at low enough temperatures , to a thin spatial slice of the order of a nanometer .",
    "this is made possible by mastering the theory and experiments on the electronic band structure of the relevant semi - conductors , and of their interface : the energy for an electronic excitation to migrate to positions far from the interface can be made a few orders of magnitude larger than temperatures of order 100 k , while the energy for an electronic displacement in the interface is much smaller .",
    "then , at low enough temperatures , electrons are restricted to a two dimensional ( 2d ) world .",
    "this , in turn , was made possible by advances in the purity and regularity control of the crystalline arrays at the interface .",
    "the reader will notice how important is the notion of `` order of magnitude '' : of energy compared with temperature , of distances compared to interatomic ones , etc .",
    "this notion was first highlighted in the philosophy of physics , i believe , by bachelard @xcite .",
    "improving the mobility of electrons at the interface of specially selected semi - conducting materials was a precondition for the experimental and theoretical study of quantum particles in a two dimensional environment , which allows to observe details at a much finer scale than at the time of the original discovery of the iqhe ] .",
    "this sets another example of the importance of the order of magnitude of the entity under study , in comparison with orders of magnitude of other relevant entities .",
    "the concept `` order of magnitude '' is a relational one .    since the discovery of the qhe , two very different experimental systems have been found to exhibit qhe .",
    "an anisotropic crystal of weakly coupled organic conducting filaments exhibits the iqhe @xcite ; then the discovery of graphene @xcite in 2004 has provided a genuinely two dimensional electronic system : a sheet of carbon , the thickness of an atomic radius , can be sliced off a graphite crystal .",
    "although i will not discuss those systems in this paper , it is worth mentioning that electrons in graphene have zero inertial mass , obey a relativistic dirac equation , and move in a two - dimensional space where the `` velocity of light '' is the fermi velocity , two to three orders of magnitude slower than the actual velocity of photons in the vacuum .",
    "the observation of quantum hall effects , and particularly that of fqhe , participated in changing significantly the theoretical outlook on electronic liquids in condensed matter physics . indeed",
    "the collective behaviour of electrons in simple metals has been described with considerable success by the landau liquid theory @xcite . within that picture ,",
    "interactions between electrons alter _ adiabatically _ the ground state , as compared to that for which interactions are neglected . in other words interactions in that picture",
    "are considered as perturbations which modify only quantitatively the parameters of the theory which has no interaction : no spontaneous symmetry breaking is usually expected . from a technical point of view , the main theoretical methods used in this context have been those of feynman diagrams , and quantum field theory .",
    "superconductivity has been explained , in part , with the landau liquids as starting point , and the mechanism for its breakdown  together with a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry  with the bcs theory : at low temperatures , the fermi sea becomes unstable to the formation of electron pairs , due to an effective attractive interaction mediated by the vibration quanta of the crystalline network @xcite ; those pairs are bosons which ( to be simple ) form a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this theoretical framework , although responsible for some irreversible advances in the understanding of a large class of insulators , semi - conductors and conductors , has met its limits with the discovery of the qhe , and of a number of other phenomena , such as mott insulators , or the high temperature superconductivity in copper oxydes in 1986 @xcite .",
    "new theoretical methods have been necessary to account for such discoveries , and in particular that of the qhe .",
    "the path followed by laughlin @xcite led him to the nobel prize award in 1993 .",
    "what is revolutionary in the qhe is : a ) the original laughlin s method to find the almost exact ground state wave function for strongly interacting fermions ( electrons ) in two space dimensions , on the basis of symmetry considerations , within a particular gauge choice ; b ) this opened  within the vast field of quantum mechanics  a new field of physics , with new methods , new theoretical entities , such as incompressible quantum fluid , composite fermions , or topological insulators .",
    "the method was a radical departure from methods that had been followed until then .",
    "in perturbative approaches , the theorist starts from a known solution for the non interacting problem , which is related to the single particle problem .",
    "although this approach may seem to justify a reductionist point of view ( i.e. the properties of electron liquids would be the sum of properties of single electrons ) , the statistical properties of electrons , due to the antisymmetry of their wave function , introduce from the start a major correction ( the exclusion principle ) to a naive reductionist viewpoint .    a useful way to think about many aspects of physical systems is that they embody conflicting energies : in the case of electronic systems , the conflict between kinetic energy and interaction energy is often essential .",
    "the reason why they are in conflict is that the equilibrium properties , which govern a large number of physical properties , depend on reaching an energy minimum .",
    "the configuration of particles , or the density , which minimizes , at equilibrium , the kinetic energy is in general qualitatively different from that which minimizes their interaction energy .",
    "when the kinetic energy dominates , the wave functions spread in space as much as is possible ; repulsive interactions in this case are a weak perturbation of the system with zero interaction : on the theory side , a zero order solution is easily constructed from the knowledge of the single particle behaviour .",
    "when interactions dominate , each particle becomes an obstacle to the motion of all others ; the hopefully simple limit of infinite interactions is in general one with a ground state which has a formidable degeneracy , and there is no intuitive way to guess how this degeneracy may be lifted when interactions become finite .",
    "a whole new world of symmetry breaking possibilities opens up , and the reductionist point of view is of little help : the properties of the whole may differ qualitatively from that of its parts .",
    "this is at the basis of so - called emergent properties .",
    "what laughlin showed is that , in the case of the quantum hall effect , physical intuition , a careful analysis of the symmetries of the problem , and clever choice of theoretical language , could provide for an answer , at little or no computational cost . in most problems so far dealing with many body physics , after the nineteen fifties ,",
    "quantum field theory had been considered a necessary tool .",
    "laughlin broke away from this paradigm and provided an answer written in terms of bona fide wave functions , written in first quantization language .",
    "the choice of theoretical language , namely quantum field theory or first quantization , seems , at first sight , to be a matter of convenience , at least in non relativistic physics , which is in general the case of condensed matter physics .",
    "quantum field theory is a technical progress in handling many - particle states , because of their symmetry ( bosons ) or antisymmetry ( fermions ) under permutation of particles .",
    "contrary to some philosophy papers , quantum mechanics of many particle systems do not alter the fundamental duality / conflict of waves and particles , which is at the basis of all quantum formulations , either in terms of quantum fields or in terms of first quantized wave functions : the schr@xmath0dinger equation is the fundamental starting point .",
    "the classical hall effect was described by hall in 1879 : if an electrical current is driven through a flat metallic bar ( see figure ( [ fig01 ] ) ) in the presence of a static magnetic field @xmath1 the direction of which is orthogonal to the bar surface , a gradient of electronic density is created in the bar in a direction orthogonal to that of the current .",
    "this gradient leads to a potential difference @xmath2 between the edges of the bar .",
    "this defines a `` hall resistance '' @xmath3 which is proportional to the field and inversely proportional to the electronic density , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is a surface density if the current is stricly two - dimensional and @xmath6 is the electron charge .",
    "the classical theoretical graph for @xmath3 is thus a straight line as a function of @xmath1 , with a slope inversely proportional to the electron density .",
    "the experimental set - up sketched in figure [ fig01 ] is a perfect example of what bachelard @xcite called a _ phenomenon operator _",
    "i.e. an artifact constructed in the laboratory , on the basis of theoretical views , to investigate the response of nature to specific stimulations . hacking @xcite developed similar views on experimental set - ups .    in a perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "the classical electron motion in free 2d space is circular , with frequency @xmath7 .    in the presence of an electric field @xmath8 and a magnetic field @xmath9 , the straightforward analysis of the resistivity , when interactions can be neglected , relies on the ( newton ) equation of motion of a single classical charge which describes the time evolution of the particle momentum @xmath10 : @xmath11 this equation is valid when dissipation processes are neglected .",
    "the current density is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "the resistivity @xmath13 is defined by the ( matrix ) equation @xmath14 this defines longitudinal resistivity by , for example , @xmath15 , and transverse resistivity by @xmath16 .",
    "the result is : @xmath17    thus @xmath18 and the hall resistivity @xmath19 .",
    "the conductivity matrix @xmath20 is the inverse of the resistivity matrix : @xmath21 notice that the result ( [ ro ] ) is counter - intuitive : the longitudinal conductivity vanishes together with the longitudinal resistivity .",
    "this is due do the transverse character of transport in a magnetic field , which is also the reason for the matrix formulation .      in the nineteen thirties ,",
    "landau studied the quantum mechanical motion of an electron in a magnetic field in two dimensions .",
    "he found that the equations of motion are those of a quantum harmonic oscillator , so that , as for the quantum oscillator , the energy levels ( which in this problem are called `` landau levels '' ) of the electron are equidistants , with a spacing @xmath22 the energy levels @xmath23 are labeled by positive integers @xmath24 : @xmath25 each level has a large field dependent degeneracy : the number of states per landau level ( hereafter noted ll ) is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the sample surface , and @xmath28 is the density of magnetic flux through the sample surface , measured in units of flux quantum @xmath29 . typically , for a magnetic field of order a few tesla , @xmath30 par @xmath31 , a large degeneracy indeed .",
    "since electrons are fermions , they gradually fill the ll electronic states , as their number increases .",
    "it is natural to define a ll filling factor @xmath32 : @xmath33        figure ( [ fig1:02 ] ) is a schematic diagram of the landau levels and their occupation by single electron states .",
    "interesting magnetic effects  well known in 1980  occur at low magnetic fields when the number of occupied landau levels is large ; i do not discuss them in this paper .",
    "the quantum hall effects arise at large fields , such that the ll degeneracy is of the order of the number of electrons in the sample , i.e. such that only a few landau levels are occupied .      as mentioned above , theoretical and technological advances in the nineteen seventies allowed to foresee the experimental realization of two - dimensional samples with good control of the electron density .",
    "the experimental realization of a situation where only one landau level ( the lowest energy one ) would be partially or completely occupied became a practical possibility .",
    "it was natural to explore the theoretical prediction for the behaviour of such electron systems under perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the coulomb interaction energy has to be much larger than the kinetic energy , which practically vanishes from the picture when the lowest ll only is completely or partially occupied .",
    "the `` normal science '' prediction ( to use kuhn s language ) was to predict the occurrence , when only the lowest landau level is occupied , at low temperature of a `` wigner crystal '' or , equivalently , a `` charge density wave '' @xcite .",
    "the former is a compressible crystalline array of electrons stabilized by the minimization of the interaction energy : instead of organizing in a fermi sea of itinerant electrons with overlapping wave functions which spread over the whole sample volume , the electrons stay localized around lattice points ; staying as far apart from one another as possible minimizes their interaction energy .",
    "such objects are known to exist in other areas of condensed matter physics .",
    "a straightforward prediction , associated to this idea , was that this would result in an insulating behaviour below the temperature for crystallization of the electrons .",
    "this again was a well known logical consequence of the inevitable sample defects ( impurities , dislocations , etc . ) which are known to pin the electron crystal to the sample atomic lattice , thus suppressing the electronic conductivity .",
    "another straightforward prediction was that this wigner crystal , which breaks the continuous translation symmetry of a liquid , would possess phonon modes , i.e. quantized vibrations of the electron lattice , with an energy mode going continuously to zero with their inverse wavelength .",
    "in other words , the prediction was that below the wigner crystal crystallization temperature , the longitudinal and hall resistance would diverge exponentially with inverse temperature , and low energy phonon modes would exist .",
    "the classical hall resistance is represented on figure ( [ fig02 ] ) by a dotted line .",
    "von klitzing undertook the task to check the wigner crystal prediction with the available samples and magnetic fields .",
    "his experimental project was , as usual , heavily intertwined with the theoretical notions described above .",
    "his findings were radically different from the predicted effect .",
    "not only did the hall ( transverse ) resistance develop plateaux around integer values of the filling factor of electronic ll , but the longitudinal resistivity was found to vanish exponentially with temperature around the same values ! there was no sign of any tendency towards a compressible insulating wigner crystal . and there is no sign of low energy phonon modes . on the contrary ,",
    "a gap is observed to govern the low temperature properties .",
    "furthermore , the conductivity for each plateau appeared to be a constant ( identical for all plateaux ) times an integer , the number of totally filled landau levels , which characterizes each plateau .",
    "the `` normal science '' prediction was a total failure . should physicists have given up fermi statistics , or the quantum description of electronic motion in the presence of magnetic or electric fields , or perhaps quantum mechanics ?",
    "should they have regarded all or part of those theories as obsolete beliefs ?",
    "none of this happened .",
    "the wigner crystal prediction was ( temporarily ) abandoned , and the experimental result acquired the status of riddle .    just as the failed wigner crystal prediction , the iqhe discovered by v. klitzing @xcite in 1980 ( nobel prize in physics in 1985 ) , is in fact a consequence of landau level quantization , together with the pauli principle obeyed by fermions .",
    "in contrast with the failed theoretical predictions , laughlin @xcite concentrated first on electron transfer from one edge of the hall bar to the other . the iqhe is due to an incompressible electronic liquid state .",
    "incompressibility here means there is a gap between the ground state and the first excited energy level in the structure of energy levels of the system . at low temperatures ,",
    "when @xmath34 , constant hall resistance plateaux appear ; they are quantized as @xmath35 where @xmath24 is an integer , the integer part of the ll filling factor : @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the proportionality constant is a universal constant @xmath37 !",
    "each plateau in the hall resistance coincides with zero longitudinal resistance , or , more precisely , exponentially decreasing @xmath38 with temperature ( low field part of figure ( [ fig02 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the wigner crystal hypothesis was subsequently proved correct , but in a different range of parameters , and found to describe the physics of the 2d electron system under magnetic field at lower filling fraction . ]",
    "@xmath39 , and in certain cases for higher ll quantum numbers than those for which various qhe states are stabilized .",
    "in particular , new details of the hall resistance experiments have been explained by a competition of qh states with a novel version of the wigner crystal @xcite : crystalline arrays of electron droplets , each droplet containing an integer number ( larger than one ) of electrons .",
    "this last paragraph may sound confusing .",
    "how can the wigner crystal prediction of reference @xcite be wrong in a given range of ll filling fraction , and right in another ?",
    "the explanation is that the free energies for the wigner crystal and that of the qh state compete with one another , and the competition depends on the ll filling fraction @xmath32 . whichever has the lowest free energy in a given range of @xmath32 values",
    "will be stabilized at the expense of the other .",
    "the authors of the wigner crystal prediction @xcite , wrote their paper before the experiment was done .",
    "it revealed instead a new , unknown state of matter  the qh state  , because of its lower energy than that of the wigner crystal .",
    "the wigner crystal disagreement with experimental prediction in a certain range of @xmath32 values did not prove it wrong as a possible physical state of the 2d electron system .",
    "as laughlin proved the qh states had lower energy in the experimental range of parameters which was studied at first .",
    "in other ranges of ll filling fraction , the wigner crystal may be the winning physical state .",
    "the resistance quantization is independent of the sample geometry , which is a remarkable property in two spacedimensions : the hall resistance @xmath3 at a plateau is given in terms of fundamental constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the resistance value accuracy at @xmath42 is such ( @xmath43 ) that this plateau now serves to define the resistance metrology standard , the v. klitzing constant , @xmath44 ohms .",
    "in fact , as appears from notes which von klitzing scribbled on his experimental notebook , he immediately guessed that the value of the resistivity plateau he observed was the resistance quantum @xmath37 .",
    "the discovery of the fqhe @xcite , which was another huge surprise , followed in 1983 .",
    "it occurs at \" magical  ll filling fraction .",
    "] smaller than @xmath45 , in particular that of the lowest ll .",
    "the first observed fractional plateau ( i.e. at fractional ll filling fraction ) was at @xmath46 . since then , with better samples , more accurate measurements , etc . , a wealth of other plateaux have been observed .",
    "our basic understanding to - day is based on the fqhe theory by laughlin @xcite in 1983 : he proposed an almost exact many particles trial wave function which describes an incompressible electronic liquid . in the fqhe",
    "as well , an incompressible quantum liquid is one for which the excitation spectrum is separated from the ground state by an energy gap .    in this picture",
    ", laughlin @xcite made the revolutionary proposal that , associated with the fractional occupation of the ll , were various fractionally charged excitations with respectively @xmath47 of an electronic charge .",
    "this prediction has been later on proved experimentally correct , at least inasmuch as the existence of the @xmath48 fractionally charged excitation has been experimentally verified .",
    "furthermore , such excitations obey `` fractional statistics '' .",
    "the latter is a generalization of the statistics which govern quantum particles in three space dimensions ; in the latter case , particles obey either fermi statistics ( electrons , neutrons , protons ) or bose statistics ( @xmath49he , photons , @xmath50 particles , etc . ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "the exchange of two identical particles may multiply the wave function by a factor @xmath51 where @xmath52 can be _ any _ angle , whence the name _ anyon _ coined for such particles , the existence of which have overcome a long standing belief that particles have only a binary choice of statistics . in three dimensions , the angle @xmath52 for exchange of two particles is either @xmath53 ( bosons ) or @xmath54 ( fermions ) .",
    "various generalizations followed .",
    "in particular the fqhe may well be the signature of the condensation or emergence of a new type of particle , known as composite fermion @xcite ( hereafter cf ) .",
    "the latter are bound states of an electron ( a fermion ) and an even number of flux quanta , a quite novel idea and a quite novel particle . in fact",
    "laughlin s wave function may be recast in the cf language . in this picture ,",
    "the @xmath48 fqh plateau is a completely filled ll of cf .",
    "the surface per cf state is @xmath55 times the surface of an electron state @xmath56 .",
    "cf represent at least a useful theoretical tool to understand many new features of the quantum hall effects .",
    "they have allowed theoretical predictions which have been successfully tested .",
    "the history of physics has taught us that many new theoretical concepts which were thought at first to be mere mathematical constructs to account for phenomena ( _ sauver les apparences _ , following duhem @xcite ) , eventually were shown to reflect in a more or less detailed way objective material features of the world .",
    "the heliocentric model of copernicus , the atoms , the molecules , the electrons , the photons , the molecular carriers of genetic information , etc . , have transited in the course of history , from the status of useful hypothesis to that of more or less exact reflection of real material entities .",
    "there are many theoretical and experimental facts which suggest that the cf hypothesis may reflect our present knowledge of such real objects .",
    "most advances in many - body physics , until the discovery of the fqhe , had used perturbation methods , apart from gell - mann s eightfold way , mott s theory of a class of magnetic insulators , or anderson s theory of the resonating valence bond @xcite .",
    "what became clear with the fqhe was the unsuspected richness of strongly interacting systems , be they electronic or nuclear systems .",
    "the yang - mills gauge theories have developed gauge field theories to study strong interactions , and spontaneous symmetry breaking , etc .. with his work on the fqhe , laughlin chose a different theoretical path , and showed that strong electronic interactions had in store many surprises , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "new concepts have emerged as the consequences of novel experimental phenomena , reflecting the existence of unforeseen particles , unforeseen realities .",
    "this is explained in more technical details below .",
    ".[complem ]      in the classical treatment of two dimensional electron motion in the presence of a ( perpendicular ) magnetic field , it is found that electrons move in circular orbits characterized by a radius which depend on their kinetic energy .",
    "this is because the lorentz force @xmath57 is orthogonal to the electron velocity @xmath58 , and does no work : it merely deflects the electron from a rectilinear trajectory in zero magnetic field .",
    "the coordinates @xmath59 , @xmath60 of the circle center are constants of motion , which may be located at any point on the sample surface .",
    "the quantum treatment can not start from the lorentz force equation ; it has to start with the lagrangian or the hamiltonian , which are formulated in terms of the potentials , in particular in terms of the vector potential @xmath61 , the curl of which yields the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath61 lies in the plane perpendicular to @xmath9 , i. e. the sample plane .",
    "the details will not be given here .",
    "however an important remark is that gauge invariance enters the problem while it is absent in the classical lorentz force equation .",
    "gauge invariance proves an important tool @xcite for the flexibility of theoretical approaches of the quantum problem .",
    "the quantum treatment of the 2d electron system in perpendicular magnetic field also has constants of motion @xmath59 , @xmath60 , i.e. operators which commute with the hamiltonian @xmath62 : @xmath63 = 0 \\hspace{2 cm } [ y , h ] = 0.\\ ] ] however a new feature appears : the well known non commutativity of the momentum operators @xmath64 with the position operators @xmath65 leads , for 2d electrons in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 , to the following commutator of @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath66 = il^2_b \\hspace{2 cm } \\left [ \\eta_x,\\eta_y \\right ] = -il^2_b\\ ] ] in the second equation above , @xmath67 are the coordinates of the electron relative to @xmath68 .",
    "the length @xmath69 which appears is the so - called `` magnetic length '' defined by @xmath70 .",
    "the surface @xmath71 is that through which the flux of the field @xmath1 is one flux quantum @xmath72 .",
    "the commutator in equation ( [ xy ] ) is , of course , gauge invariant . in the zero field",
    "single particle quantum mechanics , the commutator of @xmath73 and @xmath74 defines a surface @xmath75 in phase space , as found by planck in his study of the black body radiation . equation ( [ xy ] ) defines a surface @xmath76 in the . _",
    "real space in this problem plays the role of phase space in the zero field problem_. in other words each electronic state occupies in the sample a surface through which a flux quantum @xmath77 is threaded by the magnetic field .",
    "the heisenberg relations associated to the commutator in equation ( [ xy ] ) are : @xmath78 the surface @xmath76 plays the role that @xmath41 plays in the zero field quantum mechanics !",
    "it is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "typically for a field of a few tesla , the length @xmath69 is of order of @xmath80 to @xmath81 nm .    equation ( [ delta ] ) expresses the fact that the spatial extent of an electron state has center of motion coordinates which are spread over a surface @xmath76 . in terms of a measurement language , it means that @xmath59 and @xmath60 can not be simultaneously determined with a better accuracy than @xmath82 together with equation ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "both uncertainty relations , i.e. equation ( [ delta ] ) , and the standard heisenberg relations in the absence of field , are a direct consequence of the commutator of @xmath74 and @xmath83 . however , ( [ delta ] ) deals with a surface in real space , in contrast to a surface in phase space .",
    "while the latter is an abstract concept , the former is straightforward and concrete .",
    "this should allow the heisenberg uncertainty principle to appear less mysterious to whoever wants to understand the meaning of quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum mechanics in zero field sets a limit to the classical definition of a point in phase space , because the classical notion of trajectory  given by the simultaneous determination of @xmath84 and @xmath85  becomes irrelevant at a microscopic level .",
    "similarly , equation ( [ delta ] ) sets a limit to the classical notion of center of motion in a magnetic field : it is spread over the state surface @xmath56 .",
    "infinite accuracy would require an infinite field , for which @xmath86 would vanish , which would also mean infinite energy for the lowest ll .",
    "the complementarity of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is straightforward , since their uncertainty serves to determine a surface in real space : the surface occupied by a quantum state .",
    "thus , the simplest quantum treatment of 2d electrons in a magnetic field , besides being a first step for the qhe theory , offers an interesting view point on complementarity .    the landau level degeneracy can be directly found from the surface associated to a flux quantum : the number of states per level and per unit sample surface is obtained by dividing the latter by the flux quantum surface , i.e. @xmath56 ; or , equivalently , by dividing the total flux per surface unit by the flux quantum : @xmath28 .",
    "this result was mentioned above : it can be derived with no knowledge of the mathematical solution of the schrdinger equation , merely by using the commutation relations ( [ xy ] ) .",
    "a consequence of ( [ xy ] ) is that a variation of @xmath1 induces a variation of the number of states available for electrons per landau level in a given sample , since the degeneracy of the latter is @xmath87 per surface unit . since the electron density is in general fixed in a given sample , increasing the field intensity @xmath1 amounts , at temperature low compared to the inter - level energy distance @xmath88 , to gradually emptying high energy levels of their electrons which are transferred to lower energy ones",
    "what is happening when , at large enough @xmath1 , the lowest landau level is only partially filled ?",
    "the answer to this question was awarded the nobel prize , and is described in section ( [ fqh ] ) .",
    "the basic ingredients to understand the iqhe are :    * each completely filled ll contributes a conductance quantum @xmath89 to the sample hall conductivity . _",
    "the latter is thus defined in terms of universal constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 ! _ * electrons added to , or subtracted from the filled ll are localized by the sample impurities , and do not contribute to electric transport , so that the conductivity remains pinned at its value for the filled ll , until electrons become delocalized . as mentioned above , increasing the magnetic field intensity amounts to creating more states in each ll for a fixed number of electrons in the sample .",
    "thus , starting from a filled ll situation , increasing the field intensity amounts to gradually emptying the highest occupied ll of its electron population .",
    "conversely , starting from a filled ll situation , and decreasing the field intensity , decreases the number of states per ll , and promotes a number of electrons to the next higher energy ll . in the absence of impurities ,",
    "no plateau can be formed , and the classical behaviour of the hall resistance should be retrieved . * upon adding , or subtracting more and more electrons away from the filled ll condition , one eventually saturates the number of impurity sites which localize electron states ( or hole states ) and one finally reaches a different plateau corresponding to a different filling factor .    in other words , the unprecedented accuracy of the iqhe plateaux is allowed by the very imperfections of the samples !",
    "another surprise was mentioned above : in 2d , the transverse conductance of a hall bar is independent of the geometric details of the sample ! this is in sharp contrast with resistivity measurements of a 3d material , which are plagued by the accuracy constraints on length , diameter , etc .. sample defects as a cause of accuracy on the determination of a fundamental constant of physics : some would call this a paradox , some a contradiction . in any case",
    "this should stimulate some thoughts about the coexistence of contraries in the world , and in the process of its knowledge .",
    "the explanation of the iqhe does not require an explicit many - body wave function .",
    "the only necessary ingredients are single electron wave functions in a magnetic field , and the exclusion principle for fermions , which states that no two electrons can occupy simultaneously the same state . in order to sort out the behaviour of one electron",
    ", one must chose a gauge for the potential vector , while formulating a theory , the results of which must be independent of the gauge choice . to study the way electrons",
    "fill completely the lowest ll , the best gauge choice is that which makes theory simplest . in turn , this depends on the problem at hand . if one is interested in a multiply connected disk geometry @xcite , the symmetric gauge comes in handy : states are concentric rings .",
    "laughlin found the first argument for the iqhe by resorting to such a geometry , and invoking gauge invariance .",
    "it is easier to describe the physics of the hall bar geometry by resorting to another gauge choice , the landau gauge , whereby the vector potential is perpendicular to the bar long dimension .",
    "this leads to a rigorous analogy between the conducting properties of the electron liquid in a 2d hall bar and a one dimensional conductor .",
    "the conductivity of the latter is a trivial undergraduate problem .",
    "but the solution of this problem answers the main questions about the iqhe , and allows to introduce a new concept in physics : that of the topological insulator .",
    "a topological insulator is a conducting material the volume of which has insulating properties , while conduction occurs on the sample surface , with no dissipation in the qh filled ll case .",
    "the hall bar has a zero resistance `` chiral '' one dimensional electron channel on each side of the bar .",
    "the current directions on either side of the bar are antiparallel .",
    "the term `` chiral '' , means that electrons travel in one direction only , and can not suffer back scattering ( resistive ) collisions .",
    "the vanishingly small longitudinal resistivity of a macroscopic hall bar is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon : a quantum phenomenon which occurs in the macroscopic world .    in other words ,",
    "the iqhe resistivity plateau , beside the paradox , or contradiction , noted above about impurities , topples the traditional antinomy between insulator and conductor , in a different way from that of semi - conductors .",
    "because it is both quantum and macroscopic , it is yet another example , besides superfluidity , ferromagnetism , non locality effects in entangled macroscopic states , neutron stars , etc .",
    ", of the fuzzy boundary between the quantum world and the classical one .",
    "classical behaviour is in general a property of macroscopic objects , at least in a wide range of experimental parameters .",
    "macroscopic quantum phenomena compel physicists and philosophers to reflect upon , and clarify , the necessary conditions for emergence of the classical behaviour of matter from the quantum laws of the microscopic world .",
    "topological insulators are a quickly developing subject nowadays which should have an impact on such studies .",
    "ferromagnetism is another macroscopic quantum phenomenon the effects of which have been known experimentally for a few thousand years .",
    "iron ( fe ) , cobalt ( co ) , nickel ( ni ) , are transition metals which exhibit ferromagnetism at room temperature . below a certain temperature , known as the critical temperature @xmath90 , those metals , and their alloys , exhibit a continuous / discontinuoustransition to a spontaneously broken symmetry state .",
    "the high temperature state has the full rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian . at a temperature smaller than @xmath90",
    ", a macroscopic magnetization vector appears , which selects an arbitrary direction in space .",
    "the symmetry of that state is reduced to axial symmetry around the magnetization vector .",
    "the historical development of the theoretical understanding of ferromagnetism has been slow in the twentieth century , with antagonistic schools claiming a thorough account of phenomena on the basis of conflicting hypothesis : one claimed that electrons in ferromagnetic metals are localized at the lattice sites ; this theoretical picture relied on the success of the so called heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "the latter seemed at first to account for a number of ferromagnetism phenomena ; it describes how localized electronic spins interact through inter - site coupling energies which change sign when the coupled spins change from parallel to antiparallel directions .",
    "the other theoretical picture paid more attention to the metallic character of ferromagnets , which is described by delocalized electrons , the wave functions of which spread in the whole sample volume , and interact through intra - site coulomb repulsive energy .",
    "this school relied on the so called hubbard hamiltonian , which allowed to account for more detailed phenomena ( alloy phenomenology , etc . ) .",
    "eventually , those antinomic pictures were tentatively reconciled in a complicated theory , whereby delocalized electrons interact in a way such that they behave much as localized ones .",
    "the delocalized picture has been able to explain many experimental features .",
    "the delocalized character is the dominant feature , the only which can reconcile magnetic , transport and alloy properties .",
    "but it is safe to say that the theory of magnetic transition metals is not yet in a fully satisfactory state .",
    "not so for the quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "it is the best known and understood example of ferromagnet .",
    "a two dimensional quantum hall ferromagnet is stabilized because of coulomb interactions between electrons when the lowest landau level is full , and all others empty .",
    "the interaction energy is minimized when all spins are in the same symmetric state , and the orbital part of the wave function is fully antisymmetric , as it should because of fermion statistics .",
    "this ensures that no two electrons can be close to one another .",
    "the many body wave function for the quantum hall ferromagnet is almost exactly known , from lauglin s theory , because there is a large gap for single reversed spin excitations , so that the whole quantum hall physics can be reduced to the study of a single level .",
    "furthermore , topological spin excitations of this ferromagnetic material , called skyrmions exhibit both theoretically and experimentally the property that a spin texture carries necessarily with it a charge texture , so that a skyrmion carries one electronic charge .",
    "this is elegantly demonstrated theoretically by resorting to the berry phase calculation of quantum adiabatic transport around the skyrmion center @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the quantum hall ferromagnetism and that of , say , fe , is  besides the two dimensionality of the qh samples  the negligible kinetic energy term in the quantum hall case : all electrons have the same kinetic energy , so the latter drops out of the picture : the competition ( contradiction ) between kinetic energy and interaction energy is entirely dominated by the interaction energy term .",
    "the latter is minimum when all spins are parallel .",
    "the originality of laughlin s work is manifold . he faced a problem",
    "for which , if the interaction energy were neglected , the ground state would have a huge degeneracy : that of a distribution of @xmath91 identical particles among @xmath92 states of equal energy ! the problem of finding the ground state with the interaction energy appears at first a lot more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack",
    "!    laughlin started with the fact that the dominant energy , within the kinetic energy / potential energy conflict ( contradiction ) in the physical case at hand ( two dimensional electron gas , partial occupation of the lowest ll ) was the interaction energy energy ; this prohibits using perturbation methods on a non - interacting ground state .",
    "he used a mathematical feature of gauge symmetry ( analyticity of wave functions in the ll ) to write a many - body wave function which is restricted to the lowest ll .",
    "he used the antisymmetry requirement for the fermionic wave function to find the general form of the many - body wave function such that particles would be equally distributed among all quantized surfaces @xmath76 in the sample surface .",
    "this was dictated by the failure of the wigner crystal proposal to account for the experiments @xcite .",
    "he then proved that this unique state was separated in energy from the first excited state energy by a large gap of order of @xmath93 .",
    "this result has the force of a theorem .",
    "the numerical value of the gap is not exactly given by laughlin s wave function , but an exact evaluation can only alter this in a minor quantitative way : the qh incompressible electronic liquid is an absolutely true result of the theory , for the convenient set of parameters for which it has a lower energy than the wigner crystal .",
    "the integer or fractional value of the hall conductivity plateaux in terms of the conductance quantum @xmath89 is also an exact result .",
    "the lowest landau level single particle eigenstates , in the symmetric gauge , are all proportional to an integer power @xmath94 of the two dimensional complex position @xmath95 ( apart from a gaussian normalizing multiplicative factor ) .",
    "this analyticity property is specific of the lowest ll .",
    "an analytic wave function contains no admixture of any component pertaining to higher energy ll .",
    "two different single particle eigenstates in the ll differ by their respective exponents is the integer eigenvalue of the angular momentum operator component along the direction of the magnetic field . ] .",
    "there are as many values of @xmath94 as the degeneracy of the ll , which is , as we have seen , the number of flux quanta threading the surface sample .",
    "laughlin s choice of mathematical formulation may be thought of as a beautiful combination of invariance ( all eigenstates are analytic functions ; they are all eigenstates of the angular momentum operator projection along the external field ) and change ( two single electron eigenstates differ by their center of coordinates @xmath68 or by the quantized value of the angular momentum projection @xmath94 associated to @xmath96 ) .    in order to grasp the beauty of the many body wave function for @xmath97 particles written down by laughlin , it is useful to consider first the wave function for two particles . for a state which has rotation and translation invariance ,",
    "the most general two particle antisymmetric wave function for particles with the same spin state is : @xmath98 modulo a gaussian factor which normalizes @xmath99 in an area of order @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is the amplitude for the component with exponent @xmath94 .",
    "antisymmetry of fermion wave functions imposes that @xmath94 is odd , i.e. @xmath102 where s is any integer . strictly speaking ,",
    "@xmath99 is multiplied by the symmetric spin ket @xmath103 , which is left out , because spins play no role in the simplest theory described here .",
    "it requires both deduction and inductive intuition to admit that laughlin s wave function proposal for large @xmath104 is , logically : @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is a positive integer and the gaussian normalizing factors have been left out for simplicity . ) in fact , for @xmath107 this function is precisely the full ll wave function with all electronic spins parallel : that of the iqh ferromagnet",
    ".    the wave function for the @xmath48 filling , and full spin polarization , of the lowest ll corresponds to @xmath108 .",
    "this function has all the requisites of a many - fermions wave functions with all spins parallel : it is totally antisymmetric with respect to interchange of pairs of particles : the spin part of the wave function is symmetric since all spins are parallel .",
    "this wave function vanishes when any two electrons have the same space coordinates .",
    "this obvious remark has decisive consequences , because the coulomb repulsive energy is considerably reduced , since electrons are kept far apart from one another .",
    "laughlin nailed the coffin of the wigner crystal proposal ( for this ll filling ) by showing very simply that this state has lower energy than the wigner crystal .",
    "the astonishing property of this electronic liquid ( it is easy to see that it is a liquid , and that translation symmetry is not broken by ( [ s1 ] ) ) is that its elementary excitations are vortices with fractional charge .",
    "charges of @xmath48 of an electronic charge have been predicted and experimentally confirmed using several techniques .",
    "this discovery may inspire useful considerations on reductionism ; electrons and magnetic field are of course the basic bricks of the qh effects .",
    "in the integer qhe , one only needs solving the single particle schr@xmath0dinger equation and finding the quantum levels .",
    "however this does not help predicting the low temperature transport properties of a fractionally filled landau level in a finite size sample such as a hall bar .",
    "reductionism is thus simultaneously correct , and wrong : the basic bricks are electrons and magnetic field , and the whole theory is derived from the hamiltonian .",
    "thus reductionism seems vindicated .",
    "but the quantum state of a large number ( @xmath109 per @xmath110 ) of electrons has qualitatively new features(ferromagnetism , skyrmions , coupling of charge and spin textures , excitations with fractional charge , etc . )",
    "which are out of reach of reductionist approaches , as emphasized in a general context by nobel laureate p. w. anderson , in his paper entitled _ more is different _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the occurrence of fractionally charged particles in the fractional quantum hall states is an emergent property of the electronic system which can not be predicted or understood , starting from the enigma of the fractional quantum hall resistivity steps observed experimentally , except by recognizing , and working out , the new paradigm , i.e. the structure and properties of the strongly correlated many - electron system in two dimensions submitted to a magnetic field .",
    "a good proof of this is the failure of the wigner crystal proposal @xcite , based on electrons , magnetic field , and the hamiltonian , etc .",
    ", to foresee what experiments revealed , a new state of matter .",
    "this paradigm illustrates another ubiquitous property of the world : the transformation of quantity in quality , in different ways : it required at first a sufficient lowering of the temperature , in a sufficiently intense magnetic fields to go over from the linear slope of the classical hall resistivity with field to the quantum hall plateaux .",
    "varying the magnetic field intensity allows to go over from an accurately quantized hall plateau , with zero longitudinal resistivity , to a continuous variation of both ( see figure [ fig02 ] ) . and",
    "it took a sufficient density of 2d electrons in a sufficiently intense magnetic field to have a novel electron quantum hall liquid with fractionally charged excitations , which came as a complete surprise .",
    "laughlin s successful explanation of the iqhe and fqhe is based on a few fundamental and simple quantum mechanical laws for a 2d electron system submitted to a static perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "quantum mechanics needs nowadays no confirmation of its validity .",
    "if it did , the theoretical success it registers with the qhe would be an additional proof of the truth content of the schr@xmath0dinger equation , of the superposition principle , of the motion of charged microscopic particles in a magnetic field , etc ..      the theoretical discovery of fractionally charged excitations in condensed matter physics , and their experimental observation has a general conceptual novelty which goes far beyond the apparently restricted area of the physics at hand .",
    "it overcomes the belief that particles with fractional charge are only found in the strong interaction physics of quarks .",
    "laughlin s wave function ( equation [ s1 ] ) explains the fqhe at ll filling fraction @xmath111 .",
    "but it fails to account for a number of fqh plateaux , such as , for example @xmath112 , which have been discovered after the first experimental findings .",
    "the plateau at @xmath113 is part of the series @xmath114 , where @xmath84 and @xmath106 are positive integers . in 1989 , jain @xcite proposed a trial wave function based on a re - interpretation of laughlin s wave function .",
    "he simply separated the factors with exponent @xmath115 , as a product of two factors , one with exponent @xmath116 and one with exponent @xmath45 .",
    "the result is to interpret the fqh plateau at @xmath117 as the fully occupied ll wave function for composite fermions , for the iqh plateau at an effective cf filling factor @xmath118 ( instead of @xmath119 for @xmath120 for electrons ) .",
    "the other factor is interpreted as the wave function for @xmath116 vortices attached to each electron .",
    "each vortex is associated to a hole in the electron liquid , and carries a flux quantum threading the sample . in other words ,",
    "the laughlin wave function for @xmath121 can be analyzed as that of a filled ll where each electron is attached to @xmath116 flux quanta .",
    "an electron attached to an even number of flux quanta is a composite fermion ( cf ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that electrons attached to an even number of flux quanta , whatever the meaning or the mechanism of the attachment process , are fermions .",
    "the novelty introduced by jain is to replace the wave function of the filled ll at @xmath118 ( for @xmath122 ) by the wave function for @xmath84 filled landau levels . as a result",
    ", the plateau at @xmath123 is viewed as due to @xmath124 filled ll with cf carrying two flux quanta .",
    "the effective field applied to the cf is the real field reduced by the density of flux quanta which have been attached to the electrons .    at this stage",
    ", cfs can be seen as a trick to generalize laughlin s theory of the fqhe at @xmath125 to the new family of states with @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "duhem @xcite would say cf help `` save appearances '' , but has no nontological meaning .",
    "however the simple physical idea behind the cf story is that at fractional ll filling @xmath128 , the strong interaction energy is minimized when electrons are kept on the average a distance @xmath129 apart .      .",
    "[ metal ]    jain s cf picture was quite successful at interpreting various observed families of qh plateaux .",
    "the situation became somewhat more intriguing when it was remarked that if jain s construction is applied to the half filled landau level ( @xmath131 ) , the resulting effective field on composite fermions would vanish : indeed there is one flux quantum per state in the ll , so if two flux quanta are subtracted from the external field and attached to each electron at half filling of the ll , this disposes of all available external flux quanta .",
    "the prediction then was that the cf system at @xmath130 should be a metal , in zero apparent external magnetic field , with a a filled fermi surface ( a fermi disk in 2d ) , the fermi wave vector of which is predicted accurately .",
    "this was a daring proposal , if one remembers that we have an applied magnetic field on a two dimensional electron system , the single electronic levels of which are landau levels .",
    "experiments , such as the measurement of cf cyclotron orbit , ultrasound absorption , etc . , have beautifully confirmed this prediction of the cf picture .",
    "the notion of flux quanta attached to electrons and subtracted from the real field to yield a vanishing field at half ll filling has gained flesh as a notion which may reflect , at least in some essential way , a real process of nature .",
    "another daring proposal , taking the metallic state of cf at @xmath132 as a fact of nature is to propose that cf might condense in a bcs superconducting state , as happens for most ordinary metallic states in zero magnetic field at low enough temperature .",
    "this suggestion converges with a theoretical pairing proposal which had been formulated earlier to account for the state at @xmath133 . at the time of this writing ,",
    "the author is not aware of experimental evidence for or against this spectacular suggestion which would , if confirmed , add a novel member to the family of superconducting states .",
    "cf , of course can not exist in vacuum .",
    "if they are true entities , they need the specific medium of 2d electron qh liquid , under magnetic field , to exist .",
    "the amount of correct predictions and of experimental results it allows to explain is impressive ; future theoretical and experimental work should allow to clarify their ontological status .",
    "in the above sections i have mentioned the existence of opposites which contradict each other within some objects in nature .",
    "i have stated a number of theoretical and experimental results as if they were unquestionable .",

    "none invites a healthy sense of reality ... by attending only to knowledge as representation of nature , we wonder how we can ever escape from representations and hook - up with the world .",

    "( the twentieth ) john dewey has spoken sardonically of a spectator theory of knowledge ... i agree with dewey .",
    "i follow him in rejecting the false dichotomy between acting and thinking from which such idealism arises ... yet i do not think that the idea of knowledge as representation of the world is in itself the source of that evil .",
    "the harm comes from a single - minded obsession with representation and thinking and theory , at the expense of intervention and action and experiment _ '' .",
    "i agree with hacking , inasmuch as he defends scientific realism .",
    "scientific realism says that the entities , states and processes described by correct theories really do exist .",
    "i do not underestimate , as i think hacking seems to do , the explanatory power of a correct theory , such as laughlin s theory for the quantum hall effects .",

    "the certainty i have about the reality of a qh incompressible electron liquid originates jointly from theory , experiments , and observations of qh plateaux in @xmath134 together with an exponentially low longitudinal resistivity @xmath38 .",
    "however this certainty is intimately connected , not only with the explanation provided by laughlin , but also with various historical acquisitions of physics ; for example the certainty that quantum mechanics describes correctly a vast amount of microscopic phenomena , which are at the basis of countless technologies which billions of humans use everyday , which govern an increasing amount of industrial production , of all sorts of weaponry , as well as ( devastating ) financial operations worldwide .    hacking points out that not all experiments are loaded with theory , as lakatos @xcite would have it .",
    "the qhe belong to this category of discoveries where experiments were intimately intertwined with theory .",
    "the actual initial specific theoretical prediction of the wigner crystal turned out to be denied ( falsified ) by the experimental result , but countless theoretical advances such as electromagnetism , the classical theory of the hall effect , schr@xmath0dinger equation , band theory of cristalline material , etc .",

    "compare with hacking ( p.146 of @xcite ) : `` _ `` real '' is a concept we get from what we , as infants , could put in our mouth _ ''    how come hacking does not refer to those predecessors who have stressed , as he does , that the criterion of reality is practice ?",

    "but contrary to kant s and cartwright s thesis , there is , in general , no limit to the accuracy with which epistemics approach ontological truths . at any finite time in human history , except in few cases , there is no complete bridging of the the gap between the representation of the _ thing _ and the _ thing in itself_. when topology is concerned absolute truths can be reached , but they are only partial truths about the `` thing '' .",

    "however neither chalmers , nor hacking , accept that reality can be self contradictory , and in particular that theories may access to partial truths , which are absolute truths when they are related to their validity limits .",
    "what i m claiming here is that the theory of the qhe is now so well established , it has produced so many results , so many tests , so many applications , that if someone would spend time nowadays to find a theory based on different principles than those laughlin described to account for the iqhe plateaux , or for the simplest fqhe ones , her intellectual capacities would be doubted by all experts , on rational grounds .",

    "chalmers @xcite has reviewed critically the works of popper , kuhn , lakatos , and feyerabend , and concludes that `` _ the aim of physics is to set limits for the application of present day theories and develop theories which are applicable to the world with a higher degree of accuracy _ '' .",
    "his proposal is that of `` non figurative realism '' ( nfr ) : `` _ the world is what it is , independently of the knowledge we may have ; our theories , inasmuch as they are applicable to the world , are always more than statements of correlations between series of observations _ '' .",
    "however , his conclusion is that `` _ nfr does not suppose that our theories describe entities within the world , such as wave functions and fields ... we can evaluate our theories according to their degree of success in grasping some aspect of the world , but we can not go beyond that , and evaluate their success in describing the world as it is really , because we have no access to the world independently of our theories ... _ '' .",
    "chalmers denies that physics may reach ontological truths .",
    "he justifies his denial of the possibility of reaching truths by historical examples such as the fact that newton s corpuscular theory of light cannnot be reconciled with the modern theory of light , or with the failure of newton s dynamics when velocities are comparable to that of light , etc .. he states that `` _ there is no concept of truth , the quest of which would be the ultimate goal of science _ '' .    in other words ,",
    "chalmers departs partially from the positivist attitude  la duhem @xcite , following which theories establish a mere correspondence between mathematical signs and appearances , but can not go beyond . on the basis of this , a fierce battle raged between energeticists and atomicists .",
    "the former denied all ontological truth to the concept of atom , while the latter stated that atoms exist in nature .",
    "history has given a clear judgment on this matter .",
    "however , chalmers agrees with kant s transcendental idealism in denying that science can eventually access absolute truths about the world .",
    "the weaknesses of chalmers position are : 1 ) his refusal of admitting the basic thesis of dialectical materialism , namely the statement of coexistence and struggle of opposites within the `` thing in itself '' , 2 ) his under estimation of what bachelard thought essential about physics : the notion of order of magnitude @xcite and 3 ) his failure to recognize the criterion of practice as a criterion of reality . in this respect ,",
    "chalmers is one step behind hacking . both tend to have skeptic views about the relation of theory with truth .",
    "as for quantum mechanics , it may not be the ultimate theory of the microscopic world , but it is definitely true for all orders of magnitude available to day to humanity for experiments or technology .",
    "chalmers may be right when he states that electrons are not the tiny individual charged massive spheres they were thought once to be , but the correct ( non relativistic ) theory of electrons definitely rests , as putnam says @xcite on the definition of their rest mass and charge , the undiscernability principle , and their description by schr@xmath0dinger s equation . in this paper ,",
    "i have given reasons to accept that the laughlin wave function in two dimensions , under suitable magnetic field intensity is both an effective mathematical representation of the electron liquid , and reflects objective properties of that liquid , within the accuracy of present day measurements , the quality of present day hall bars , etc .. in other words absolute truths have been stated , under relevant experimental conditions and orders of magnitudes : absolute truths are also relative ones .",
    "what is at stake in a number of discussions above may be interpreted as the question of `` scientific pluralism '' : can it be that two or more conflicting theories account for the same phenomena , or account for the causal powers of the same objective real entities ?",
    "dickson @xcite defines scientific pluralism as `` _ ... the existence or toleration of a diversity of theories , interpretations , or methodologies within science _ '' .",

    "they can be mutually inconsistent , and none is the whole truth .",
    "dickson asks : _ `` how can one be a pluralist about science while respecting the ( approximate ) validity of our best scientific theories ? '' _ in the course of his paper , he defends his own admission that as far as quantum mechanics is concerned , pluralism is justified and acknowledges the existence , and toleration of a diversity of contradictory theories .",
    "he writes : _ i shall address the most obvious and serious objection to such a view ... namely , that it places the scientifically minded person in the intolerable position of explicitly endorsing contradictions within science ( as a matter of principle and not merely as a pragmatic matter ) . to do so",

    "the authors in references @xcite admit that there might be pluralism in theories , in various guises . but",
    "admitting ontological contradictions within the thing seems to all authors , except perhaps putnam , to be prohibited and intolerable .",

    "what i am defending here is that contradictions in epistemics may reflect disagreements between erroneous vs correct theories , etc . , but may also reflect .",
    "one must free oneself from the secular aristotelian prohibition  which does not mean dismissing aristotelian logic altogether , in its own domain of validity  and face the possibility that accepting contradictions in nature is a way to save the scientific enterprise when science is pluralist .",

    "i stress here that he , a philosopher convinced of the aristotelian prohibition of contradictions , is constrained to admit them as a true feature of theory .",
    "laughlin s theory of the qhe , on the other hand , seems to have no theoretical rival , to be no example of pluralism in theory .",
    "however , we have seen that the wigner crystal proposal @xcite is valid in certain magnetic field intensities or electronic density ranges .",
    "this is due to a competition of two ground states within the free energy of the 2d electronic liquid .",
    "the analogy with the ice - liquid transition in water helps understand that there is no complete exclusion of one dominated state from the dominant one : space and time dependent correlations reflecting the tendency to form the dominated phase generally exist in the dominant one .",

    "i have stressed a number of times that contradictions ",
    "the coexistence and competition / struggle of opposites  appear fairly regularly , upon scrutiny , as intrinsic features of reality .",
    "this notion , which is a fundamental aspect of dialectical materialism @xcite is often tacitly considered as a superseded pathology of stalinist dogmatism .    the formulation by engels @xcite has been the basis of the so - called `` laws '' of dialectic materialism : the unity and struggle of contraries ( or equivalently , opposites ) , the transformation of quantity into quality , and the negation of the negation . the very term of `` law '' can not be taken at face value , since it carries with it an equivalence with scientific laws .",
    "dialectical materialism is not a science , but its nature and its epistemic criteria are closely related to science @xcite .",
    "the term `` thesis '' is probably more suitable .",
    "a first observation is that dialectical materialism can not be reduced , once and for all , to the body of the three `` laws '' mentioned above .",
    "opposites , or contraries , which form a contradictory unity may be antagonistic ( so that one of the poles struggles to destroy the other ) or non antagonistic , so that the opposites coexist and interpenetrate each other @xcite .",

    "sve @xcite points out the interest and necessity of deepening our understanding of the rich variety of forms of contradictions in nature , and of their development .",
    "another observation is that the three `` laws '' listed above have not been , to the best of my knowledge , of any conscious use in the development of the theory and experiments on the qh effects .",
    "this is not surprising , but has no consequence on the question of their relationships , and that of dialectical materialism , with the topic described in this paper .",
    "dialectical materialism does not provide a scientific methodology which would be valid at all times in all cases .",

    "most times , new theoretical concept have appeared which blend the previously contradicting views into reflecting an intrinsically contradicting reality : light is both corpuscular and wave - like , so are electrons , atoms , nuclei , etc .. let me quote bohr again : `` contraria sunt complementa '' .    nowadays , thirty years after the discovery of the new `` high temperature '' superconductors@xcite , the battle is still raging between followers of the `` strong interaction '' paradigm and the `` weak interaction '' one , between `` strong repulsive '' and `` weak attractive '' ones , `` electron - electron'' interactions and `` electron - phonon '' or `` electron - polarons '' ones , etc . , with tens of thousands of published mutually conflicting papers in the scientific press :",
    "a good example of scientific pluralism , probably reflecting incompletely understood ontological contradictions .",
    "it is of interest to ascertain if a culture of contradictions , a culture about allowing the unity of opposites in our understanding of our scientific objects of studies is not one of definite interest and fecundity .",
    "the dominant ignorance , or rejection of the main thesis of dialectics in nature or in epistemics produces definite damages in scientific discussions , as well as in philosophical writings about physics .",
    "this prohibition has proved its value in the development of logic ; but the dogmatic exclusion of contradictions within nature does not seem to be justified . developing a culture which warns against unilateral views about the world seems an important task .",
    "one question in this paper is whether there is a way to examine if the results i have described give credence , or not , to a general philosophical statement about the meaning of dialectics in nature .",
    "the issue is both about the dialectics of the thought process ( the theory ) , and whether the latter reproduces , in its specific subjective way , correlations , relations and processes which exist objectively in nature , in the particular case of the physics i have discussed .",
    "the answer to this question , which this work suggests is positive , plays a role in the discussion of the numerous contemporary trends of subjectivist philosophies @xcite .    even though , as i stated above , the three thesis of dialectical materialism as formulated by engels are a somewhat schematic summary of the dialectics of nature , i proceed below to examine the qhe physics along those lines , for simplicity .",

    "perhaps the total energy of the universe , if this is a meaningful concept ... but even if this be the case , the way this energy is distributed in the various parts of the universe is a continuously evolving one . + in any case , beside its seemingly esoteric formulation , negation of negation seems a rather straightforward property of an ever changing world .",

    "i have underlined that negation of negation appears also as a thought process , as a way of interpreting the experimental curve .",
    "+ what about a qh plateau ? the resistivity value is not changed in a whole interval of the magnetic field ; but when the field varies , the distribution of electronic states inside the sample changes , since the degeneracy of the ll changes , so there is `` negation of negation '' of the electronic distribution even though the resistivity is pinned to a plateau quantum resistivity value . here",
    "change coexists with permanence , where the latter is expressed in terms of universal constants ! eventually this process leads to variation away from ( negation of ) the resistivity plateau .",

    "a `` fixed intensity of the field '' is a true property as long as the accuracy of the experiment allows to neglect its variations .",
    "fluctuations are as the oscillations of a pendulum : a continuous negation of variation leading to a variation of opposite sign , and so on .",
    "thermal equilibrium is also a continuous succession of thermal exchange between two sources of heat such that a temperature increase is immediately countered by an opposite effect . +",
    "even though the concept of negation of negation has not helped anybody at all in the discovery and explanation of the qh effect , there seems to be no difficulty in interpreting things with it a posteriori .",

    "a less trivial example , and a spectacular one at that , is the transition of the 2d electron liquid under magnetic field from the quantum hall topological insulator at ll filling @xmath140 to a 2d metallic state at @xmath141 .",
    "a more trivial one is that the qhe has no meaning for a few electrons : it only exists for a large enough number of electrons .",
    "+ we have seen along this work that this ubiquitous property of matter is important in discussing the validity of the reductionist analysis of phenomena .",
    "* contradictions , unity of opposites : the coexistence , struggle , and interpenetration of opposites ( or contraries ) in nature .",
    "+ this is the most controversial aspects of dialectical materialism in the sciences of nature .",
    "many philosophers accept as straightforward the notion that antagonistic classes exist within society , and that contradicting forces act at various levels in the objects of social sciences .",
    "but what is the validity of the notion of contradictions within a thing in nature ? can we give meaning to a statement that contraries , or opposites , co exist , struggle with and interpenetrate each other within an object ?",
    "on the other hand , how rational is the logical dogma following which contradictions in nature are prohibited ?",
    "+ i have stated above that a standard attitude of physicists is to determine what is the dominant parameter in a given object of study : entropy versus internal energy ( thermodynamics ) , kinetic energy versus potential energy ( classical and quantum mechanics , qhe ) , localization versus delocalization ( wave functions , qhe ) , continuous versus discrete ( quantum mechanics ) , symmetric versus asymmetric ( phase transitions , qhe ) , reversibility versus irreversibility ( thermodynamics , phase transitions , qhe ) order versus disorder ( phase transitions , qhe ) , long range versus short range ( phase transitions , qhe ) , insulating versus conducting ( thermal and electromagnetic properties of matter , qhe , topological insulators ) , interacting versus non interacting ( ubiquitous , qhe ) , magnetic versus superconducting ( magnetism , superconductivity , qhe ) , attraction versus repulsion ( molecules , atoms , nuclei , ) change versus invariance ( phase transitions , mechanics , qhe , etc . ) .",
    "etc .. + physicists will then examine ( not in those words ) under what conditions the dominant parameter will cease to be dominant and surrender its domination to the opposite pole : in general , this signals a qualitative change in the object under study .",
    "+ the very list of those seemingly antinomic pairs , which clearly coexist , compete ( struggle ) and interpenetrate each other in various ways is sufficient to convince that the `` third thesis '' of dialectical materialism is meaningful for a large number of problems discussed in physics , with a large diversity of ways for contradictions to appear .",
    "whoever thinks that such contradictions only exist in the subjectivity of human theoretical constructions will run into difficulties to prove her point , because of the many practical consequences which prove their objective validity .",
    "the contradictions i have listed above are convenient , at a given time in history , to describe reality because they reflect , with more or less accuracy , contradictions which are at work in nature .",
    "+ if we think about the qh phenomena discussed in this paper , how can we avoid being impressed by the fact that a transverse resistance qh plateau , which coincides , within a range of external field values , with a vanishing longitudinal resistivity , as well as a vanishing sample conductivity , is driven by the simultaneous coexistence of an extended conducting channel on the edge of the sample , with localized ( insulating ) states inside the sample ? ( a new contradiction appears here : inside versus outside ... ) i have stressed above the paradox ( contradiction ) between the accurate quantization of the hall plateaux conductivity in terms of universal constants @xmath89 , and the contingency of impurity disorder in the sample which causes those plateaux to exist ( here we have necessity versus contingency ... ) .",
    "notice also that depending on the amount of impurities , plateaux will vanish ( too many impurities ) , appear , or disappear ( no impurity disorder ) .",
    "we have here a rich variety of coexisting competing opposites .",
    "as the external magnetic field varies , the balance of localized states and extended edge states shifts , until extended states within the sample connect the two qh bar edges ; extended states within the sample connecting one edge of the hall bar with other put an end to the ( almost ) perfect conductivity of the edge channel and the quantization of the transverse resistance plateau .",
    "+ in all cases , depending of which pole , in the above list of opposites , dominates the other , and depending on the process which is at work in the contradiction , the object within which such opposites coexist will have different properties . depending on the way a given object is isolated , or submitted to external fields , the competition ( or contradiction , struggle , etc . ) between the opposites listed above may lead to qualitative differences depending of which pole dominates , the negation of negation will appear as an obvious process , or will not , etc ..    what seems to emerge from the discussion above is that it is a posteriori justified in many instances to analyze a number of objects in nature in terms of dialectical materialist terms .",
    "the variation of their properties with various parameters leads to different ways for opposites to combine within the object and change its properties .",
    "this `` combination '' of opposites may be described as a `` struggle '' , inasmuch as the domination of one over the other determines specific properties .",
    "for example when kinetic energy dominates the potential energy in a mechanical system , the latter has a qualitatively different behaviour than in the opposite case . still in classical mechanics ,",
    "a qualitative change of dynamics appears when the number of interacting bodies increases beyond @xmath142 , and chaotic trajectories emerge while analytic trajectories continue to exist . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "delocalization of the wave function lowers the kinetic energy ; the potential energy drives localization . in thermodynamics , the internal energy drives order in a state of equilibrium ;",
    "the entropy drives disorder ; order at short distance may coexist with disorder at long distance . in the qh effects ,",
    "when the orbital energy @xmath88 is small compared to the fermi energy @xmath143 of the electron system in zero field , the behaviour is classical .",
    "when on the contrary @xmath144 the qh behaviour dominates .",
    "as explained earlier , the behaviour of the 2d electronic system under strong magnetic field is entirely dominated by the interaction energy , which is much larger than the width of a landau level .",
    "the latter is determined by the fluctuations of the impurity potential .",
    "the condition on this width for the qhe to appear is that it be much smaller than the inter ll energy @xmath88 .",
    "the fundamental question about dialectical materialism is whether this analysis in terms of struggle of binary opposites is universally valid , and if such is the case , in what sense . in this paper",
    "i have discussed qh effects .",
    "their analysis shows that it is plausible . in various different ways ,",
    "dialectical materialism is supported by the qhe .",
    "this may sound trivial to many , and totally wrong to others .",
    "attacking , with rational arguments , the conventional dogma of the `` no contradiction principle '' in nature following which opposites can not coexist in a contradictory unity in nature is not a negligible contribution to the philosophy of physics .",
    "the main points i have discussed in this paper about the qhe deal with :    * \\a ) various contemporary brands of philosophy of science .",
    "i have spent time with scientific realism ( sections [ sr ] , [ nfr ] ) : hacking , in particular , acknowledges practice as a central criterion of assessing the reality of theoretical entities .",
    "i have discussed briefly , in subsection [ about ] , the shortcomings of different authorspositions more or less associated to positivism , who have not recognized the practice criterion . all",
    "seem to agree on the difficulty , or impossibility of knowledge to access truths about the world , a skepticism about theories which i have argued is impossible to hold on general grounds , and for which , in sections [ progress ] , [ revo ] , [ history ] , [ complem ] , [ fqh ] , the qhe provide a counter example . *",
    "\\b ) scientific realism .",
    "the evidence for integer or fractional hall conductivity plateaux in terms of the universal constant @xmath89 , the existence of incompressible hall liquids , as well as their competition with various forms of wigner crystals are established as true theoretical entities , as is the existence of fractional charges in the fqhe ; the qhe theories contain undisputable elements of truth about the world .",
    "the status of composite fermions , discussed in subsection [ cf ] is less clear : the concept helps retrieving different families of qhe  characterized by fractions @xmath145 where @xmath127  within the same category of theoretical entities described by the laughlin wave function ( @xmath122 ) ; the prediction and observation of the metallic state at @xmath132 lends credence to the existence of entities ( cf ) such that even numbers of flux quanta bind to electrons under determined physical conditions .",
    "the quantum dynamics of 2d electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field may well give rise to this novel real entity .",
    "i am not aware of evidence which would prove their reality in terms of individual entities within the strongly correlated qh medium",
    ". such evidence would be necessary to clarify their ontological status .",
    "* \\c ) dialectical materialism .",
    "the ubiquitous transformation of quantity into quality is obvious in the qhe as it is in many other processes of nature .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the material described in this paper is also an example of this in the process of knowledge : the accumulation of theoretical , experimental and technical advances of `` normal science '' discussed in section [ progress ] eventually results in a revolutionary advance such as the qhe .",
    "can one draw conclusions about the unity of opposites within things in the case of the qhe ? i have argued in favour of a positive answer .",
    "this is connected with the transformation of quantity in quality : for example the quantitative change of magnetic field intensity governs the transitions of qh resistivity plateau to plateau , separated by qualitatively different intervals where the longitudinal resistivity is finite : this reflects the transition from a qh regime of localized states within the hall bar , and perfectly conducting chiral edge states to a regime where both edge currents , which have become resistive , are connected by extended states within the hall bar .",
    "this is an example where perfectly conducting edge states depend on localized states within the hall bar , while resistive edge states are connected with conducting states between edges .",
    "apart from the obvious fundamental contradiction of quantum mechanical systems ( waves versus particles ) , i have reviewed a number of contraries present in the qh system under magnetic field in section [ contradict ] .",
    "the historical development of the qhe has been marked by the contradictory theories of the wigner crystal @xcite and the qhe incompressible liquid @xcite .",
    "the dialectical combination of both is now a matter of consensus among physicists , and can also be viewed in the successful interpretation of the experiments revealing re - entrance of the qhe @xcite .",
    "in fact both theories ( qhe and wigner crystal or its variations ) reflect true features of the electronic liquid in different ranges of electronic density or magnetic field intensity .",
    "scientific pluralism is often , ( not always ) a reflection in theory of ontological contradictions in the thing .",
    "i have mentioned the long lasting , now superseded , struggle between the itinerant and the localized theory of ferromagnetism .",
    "the qhe offer yet another field of knowledge where the unity and struggle of contraries within nature can be found in various forms .    in spite of their seemingly reduced area of experimental physics ,",
    "the quantum hall effects have led to a number of advances of universal significance .",
    "this is perhaps due to the well defined set of parameters ( @xmath146 ) which govern their appearance .",
    "there is little room in the physics of 2d electron liquids under magnetic field for other relevant parameters such as appear in other topics of condensed matter physics ( ferromagnetism of @xmath147 and alloys , high @xmath90 superconductivity , for example ) .",
    "this is a striking effect of the contradiction between the reduced specificity of the object of study and the universality of lessons one can learn from it .",
    "as far as lessons are concerned , this paper does not pretend to impress much the scientific practice in physics laboratories : it is spontaneously , though mostly unconsciously , materialist and dialectic . however i hope it contributes to a larger interest of philosophical thinking for dialectic materialism .",
