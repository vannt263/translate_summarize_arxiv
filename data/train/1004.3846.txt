    "discovered more than fifteen years ago,@xcite the family of quaternary intermetallic compounds , rni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( r = rare earth elements ) , have attracted great attention.@xcite they provide a unique opportunity for the investigation of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in a homologous series of compounds .",
    "they can be classified into four subgroups : magnetic members ( r = pr , nd , gd , tb ) , superconductors ( r = sc , y , lu ) , coexisting materials ( r = dy , ho , er , tm ) , and heavy fermions ( r = yb).@xcite the non - magnetic superconducting borocarbides , luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , a pristine model to study the superconductivity in this family , have the highest superconducting transition temperature : @xmath1 16.5 k and 15.5 k , respectively . despite intensive studies over the past decade , there is no consensus on their detailed gap structures . how magnetism and superconductivity coexist or compete in the coexisting members",
    "remains a topic of considerable research interest since a systematic evolution of both phase transitions is observed over a comparable temperature range ( @xmath2 k ) . on a broader context , the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism has become a central theme in the studies of novel and unconventional superconductors including heavy fermions , cuprates , and the recently discovered iron - based superconductors .",
    "the magnetic and superconducting orders in rni@xmath0b@xmath0c have different origins , arising from the localized 4f electrons on r@xmath3 ions coupled via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction,@xcite whereas the superconducting condensation is associated with the itinerant electron bands residing on the ni@xmath0b@xmath0 layers.@xcite    complex fermi surface ( fs ) structures with multiple sheets have been predicted from band structure calculations@xcite and confirmed by several experimental techniques.@xcite there are three bands crossing the fermi level , all having electron - like character.@xcite while the small ellipsoidal fs from the 19th band is known to contribute very little to the electronic density of states , both the 17th and 18th bands have been observed to comprise the major fs sheets although their topology is quite different from each other . for the magnetic borocarbides , the ` cushion'-like fs from the 18th band , coming exclusively from the ni 3@xmath4 and 3@xmath5 derived states , is not affected by the magnetic moments of the rare earth ions and , thus , the superconductivity originating from this band can survive under the development of magnetic order.@xcite    the superconductivity in the non - magnetic borocarbides rni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( r = y , lu ) has been associated with both the 17th and 18th bands.@xcite thus , a fundamental question to be addressed is comprised of two parts : ( i ) whether the superconducting order parameter consists of multiple components in these bands ; and ( ii ) what is the order parameter symmetry and anisotropy in momentum space .",
    "early on , shulga _ et al._@xcite reported on the evidence for a multi - band nature of the superconductivity from the temperature dependence measurements of the upper critical field in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and luni@xmath0b@xmath0c . a variety of experimental investigations such as photoemission spectroscopy@xcite , raman scattering @xcite , thermal conductivity@xcite , specific heat@xcite , and ultrasound attenuation@xcite point to a large anisotropy in the superconducting gap functions .",
    "more detailed information on the gap anisotropy is reported from the measurements of thermal conductivity @xcite and specific heat @xcite as a function of magnetic field orientation .",
    "clear four - fold oscillations are observed in both kinds of measurements and interpreted as strong evidence for an anisotropic gap structure with gap minima located along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions . in particular ,",
    "et al._@xcite report the possible existence of point - like nodes from the observation of diminishing oscillation amplitude as the field direction changes from the @xmath6-plane to the @xmath7-axis",
    ". this may be consistent with an extremely large gap anisotropy : @xmath8100 .",
    "it is noted that these measurements can be obscured by the anisotropy in properties other than the superconducting order parameter , making their interpretations non - trivial.@xcite this can be an issue particularly relevant to the borocabide superconductors since many properties are known to be anisotropic such as the fs,@xcite upper critical field,@xcite and vortex lattice structure.@xcite    maki and coworkers@xcite propose a hybrid s+g wave order parameter , in which the g - wave component is added as an ansatz to simulate the point - node structure implied by experimental observations .",
    "kontani@xcite point out that point - like nodes can be formed in a phonon - mediated s - wave superconducting order parameter if antiferromagnetic fluctuations exist on some parts of the fs connected by a nesting vector .",
    "earlier , band structure calculations based on local density approximation predicted a nesting feature on the fs with nesting vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the basal plane.@xcite this is directly observed from two - dimensional angular correlation measurements on luni@xmath0b@xmath0c using the electron - positron annihilation radiation technique.@xcite interestingly , an antiferromagnetic order in the magnetic borocabide compounds is observed to have an ordering wave vector @xmath11,@xcite very close to the nesting vector .",
    "the phonon - mediated pairing has long been attributed to the superconductivity in the borocarbide family.@xcite for instance , martinez - samper _ et al._@xcite report on scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements , in which features due to strong electron - phonon coupling reminiscent of a pb tunnel junction are observed .",
    "their extracted coupling constant is highly anisotropic due to soft phonon modes as observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments.@xcite according to the theoretical arguments by kontani,@xcite the nesting feature in the fs would generally weaken the electron - phonon coupling along @xmath12 .",
    "thus , this scenario can explain the experimentally observed anisotropic gap structure in the nonmagnetic borocarbide superconductors .",
    "spectroscopy based on the measurement of andreev reflection conductance has been adopted frequently as a measure to investigate superconducting order parameters ( see refs .   and   and references therein ) .",
    "called point - contact andreev reflection spectroscopy ( pcars ) , it is a simple and versatile technique , with which two groups have reported results on the nonmagnetic borocarbide family .",
    "disparate claims are made from measurements using virtually the same technique .",
    "et al._@xcite observe a large anisotropy ( @xmath13 ) between the gap values along the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] directions .",
    "they interpret this as evidence for the s+g order parameter with point nodes as suggested by maki _",
    "et al._@xcite later , they interpret this as evidence for multiband superconductivity.@xcite naidyuk and coworkers do not report such large anisotropy.@xcite between these two groups , the temperature dependences of the gap value along the [ 100 ] direction are strongly contradictory .",
    "thus , our motivation for this work was , in part , to address this controversy with our own detailed gap structure measurement in the non - magnetic borocarbide superconductors.@xcite",
    "the working principle behind point - contact spectroscopy is that the energy dependence of quasiparticle scattering at an interface between two metallic electrodes is reflected as a non - linearity in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "analysis of such nonlinearity provides important information on the scattering sources .",
    "when applied to a superconductor , the most relevant scattering process is andreev reflection , which is essentially a scattering off the pair potential .",
    "thus , pcars relies on the strong energy dependence of this scattering at a normal - metal / superconductor interface .",
    "in order to avoid complications due to other scattering processes ( elastic or inelastic ) , a point - contact junction must fulfill requirements for the ballisticity .",
    "ideally , its size needs to be smaller than the electronic mean free paths of the electrodes . in practice ,",
    "nanoscale metallic junctions can be made by bringing a sharpened metal tip into contact with a superconductor using fine mechanical adjustments .",
    "we perform systematic investigations of the gap structures in the nonmagnetic borocabide superconductors yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and luni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "differential conductance spectra along three major crystallographic directions are taken from two sets of luni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals of different sources and one set of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals .",
    "crystals from different batches are used for each direction in the set luni@xmath0b@xmath0c # 1 . for the sets luni@xmath0b@xmath0c # 2 and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c ,",

    "a crystal is cooled down to about 2 k in the liquid helium cryostat , and then a sharp gold tip is moved to engage onto the crystal surface by a fine differential micrometer until a reasonable junction resistance is reached .    the junction resistance , @xmath15 , usually ranges from several ohms to tens of ohms . applying the wexler s formula@xcite using these @xmath15 values along with known materials parameters for borocarbides ( @xmath16 1.30 @xmath17 cm and @xmath18 500   as reported in ref .  ) , we infer that the junctions are in the ballistic limit .",
    "what is more important to ensure the spectroscopic nature is that our measured conductance spectra are reproducible as shown below and free from non - spectroscopic effects such as local heating .",

    "i.@xcite below , we put forward possible explanations for this discrepancy , based on the fermi surface topology and tunneling cone effect .",
    "we note that , by nature , thermal conductivity and specific heat in the superconducting state are sensitive to the gap minimum , whereas inherently anisotropic gap features could be smeared out in pcars since the momentum of an injected electron can distribute over a wide range of angle with respect to the nominal surface normal .",
    "we begin by reviewing the fermi surface topology revealed by band structure calculations and recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes),@xcite and quantum oscillation experiments.@xcite    the claimed nesting structure on the 17th band fs has been observed by different experiments such as arpes,@xcite and electron - positron annihilation measurements @xcite , where the nested part only occupies a small portion of the fermi surface.@xcite according to kontani,@xcite antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the nested parts of the fs could induce a point - node - like gap minimum along the nesting wave vector .",
    "recently , baba _",
    "et al._@xcite have reported on the detailed gap structures in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c measured by high - resolution arpes .",
    "their results show that the superconducting gap is observed on multiple bands ( the 17th and 18th ) with very different momentum dependences .",
    "more specifically , it is revealed that the gap is highly anisotropic on the 17th band with two minima , whereas the 18th band has a nearly constant gap .",
    "the two minima are 1.5 and 2.3 mev on different parts of the 17th band fs .",
    "their momentum directions are identified as [ 100 ] , consistent with other reports.@xcite it was claimed that the points on the fs where the gap shows a minimum of 1.5 mev can be connected by the nesting vector @xmath46 , implying an intimate connection between the minimal gap and the fs nesting . it was also argued that the reason why the gap minimum has a non - zero value is because their arpes data were taken off the basal plane with @xmath47 .",
    "based on these observations from arpes , it is naturally understood that the node - like gap minimum along [ 100 ] can not be observed in pcars since the shape of a conductance curve will be dominated by the other gap minimum ( 2.3 mev ) which is located along the same direction . indeed , this gap value is close to those we observed in this study ( see table [ table : table1 ] . ) , explaining why we observe only a small gap anisotropy in both luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and yni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "our experimental results are in strong contradiction with those reported by raychaudhuri and coworkers.@xcite from pcars measurements on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , they reported a gap anisotropy of @xmath48 , much larger than ours ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly associated with their extremely small gap value along [ 100 ] ( @xmath50 mev ) since their gap value along [ 001 ] ( @xmath51 mev ) is not much different from ours .",
    "moreover , they observed that @xmath34 closes at @xmath52 k , much lower than the bulk @xmath24 .",
    "this is in strong contrast with our observation of @xmath34 closing at the bulk @xmath24 .",

    "originally interpreted their results as evidence for s+g gap structure with point nodes,@xcite and later on claimed for the multiband nature of the superconductivity in borocarbides.@xcite we think this is an unlikely interpretation considering the recent arpes measurements discussed above since there is no way for pcars , which does nt have such high momentum resolution as in arpes , to probe only an extremely small gap value ( @xmath50 mev ) while there exists another but sizable gap minimum ( @xmath53 mev ) along [ 100 ] . rather , it is more natural to attribute the exotic behavior of their measured @xmath34 to non - intrinsic effects such as suppressed superconductivity on the sample surface , as was also pointed out by naidyuk _",
    "et al._@xcite    next , we discuss the tunneling cone effect on the conductance spectra . in the original btk",
    "model,@xcite the integration is carried out only over the energy , assuming an isotropic gap structure .",
    "thus , it is inaccurate for the analysis if the energy gap has substantial dependence on momentum .",
    "a straightforward way to deal with this situation is to include an integration with respect to momentum .",
    "here sets in the tunneling cone effect.@xcite if we consider a planar tunnel junction with a potential barrier of finite thickness , the transmission probability varies depending on the momentum direction , being maximal for a direction normal to the barrier . assuming a gaussian distribution for the probability",
    ", the tunneling cone angle can be as small as @xmath54 degrees in typical tunnel junctions.@xcite this angle is expected to increase with decreasing barrier strength",
    ". therefore , its effects are not negligible in pcars due to inherently small barrier strength as well as small junction size ( uncertainty principle ) . here , we simulate conductance spectra in order to study the effect of tunneling cone on the gap structure with large anisotropy .",
    "namely , we calculate conductance curves that are obtained from a given gap function with a varying cone angle , and then determine the gap values from the peak positions . in order to simulate conductance curves",
    ", we adopt the extended btk model for a @xmath55-wave superconductor , formulated by tanaka and kashiwaya,@xcite but only consider gap functions without a sign change since there is substantial evidence in these materials for this premise .",

    "as an approximation , we assume a gaussian - type distribution : @xmath68 the parameter @xmath69 is a variable characterizing the tunneling cone for a given junction .",

    "an assumption is made that the tunneling cone @xmath69 does not depend on the surface orientations .",
    "the inherently large anisotropy is observed for a narrow tunneling cone .",
    "however , the anisotropy becomes smaller as the cone angle increases .",
    "@xmath72 at @xmath69 = 25 and 35 deg .",
    ", for the s+g and anisotropic s - wave case , respectively . although qualitatively similar , there is difference between the two gap functions in their response to the tunneling cone .",
    "that is , the calculated gap values do not merge in the s+g case , whereas they merge into one for large tunneling cone in the anisotropic s - wave case .",
    "this indicates that the anisotropic s - wave with @xmath73 deg .",
    ", rather than the s+g , agrees with the small gap anisotropy we have observed constantly .",

    "it turns out that @xmath75 is very small in all our measurements as listed in table [ table : table1 ] .",
