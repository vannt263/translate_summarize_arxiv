    "target space duality is a remarkable phenomenon where different 2-dimensional nonlinear sigma models are physically equivalent .",
    "a key reason for interest in this subject is that duality often turns a strong coupling problem into an equivalent weak coupling one thus transforming an intractable problem into a manageable one .",
    "there are two questions which immediately come to mind .",
    "the difficult one is : given a sigma model does there exist a dual model ?",
    "a more accessible one is : when are two sigma models dual to each other ? in these lectures we will attempt to address the latter question within the framework of classical hamiltonian mechanics",
    ".    basically , two sigma models are target space duals of each other if there exists a canonical transformation between the phase spaces which preserves the respective hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a map is a difficult question to determine because the phase spaces are infinite dimensional . to make progress",
    ", we look for guidance in explicit examples .",
    "the case of toroidal target spaces suggests a promising approach . the duality transformation between the infinite dimensional phase spaces , in the case of toroidal target spaces ,",
    "may be viewed as being induced by a special map between some finite dimensional bundles over the target spaces . in these lectures",
    "we address whether a similar phenomenon can arise between more general targets .",
    "we will see that it is possible to look for a special type of `` restricted '' target space duality which leads to an intriguing problem in classical differential geometry .",
    "there is a known duality transformation which arises when one of the target spaces is a simple lie group .",
    "the explicit form of the generating function suggests a generalization to more general manifolds .",
    "this plays a pivotal role in our formulation .",
    "there is a lot known about target space duality when the target is a torus .",
    "the excellent review article of giveon , porrati and rabinovici  @xcite discusses the physics arising from toroidal targets in great detail .",
    "additionally , there are roughly 300 references to the literature in this review which allow the reader to explore the historical development of the subject .",
    "we will use @xcite as our unique reference on toroidal target spaces .",
    "the more recent phenomenon of `` non - abelian '' duality goes back the work presented in  @xcite but can actually be traced back to a much older paper  @xcite .",
    "the notion that duality can be formulated as canonical transformation goes back to  @xcite even though in the 1970 s much work was done in statistical mechanics on the study of abelian duality in lattice systems from the partition function viewpoint .",
    "the explicit construction of a canonical transformation including the generating function for the target space @xmath0 is due to  @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in these lectures is different from the traditional approaches to duality presented in the literature ( see for example the discussions in @xcite ) . in all these approaches",
    "one has explicitly symmetries in the target space which play a central role in the discussion of duality .",
    "the duality transformation in these theories with symmetry is some type of generalized fourier transform .",
    "i was looking for a formulation which did not depend on the existence of symmetries .",
    "i wanted something which might be applicable to mirror symmetry  @xcite . the key analogy to keep in mind while reading these lectures",
    "is presented in table  [ oa - analogy ] .",
    "+ & _ is to _ & +    [ oa - analogy ]    mostly i will present ideas and concepts rather than detailed mathematical formulas .",
    "the derivation of explicit formulas requires a discussion of the theory of @xmath1-structures , a discussion of the differential forms version of the frobenius theorem , and a presentation of cartan s equivalence method  @xcite .",
    "these topics are outside the scope of these lectures and will be presented in part  i of @xcite .",
    "the ideas presented here can be generalized by weakening the requirement that the canonical transformation be induced by a finite dimensional map .",
    "this requires the full machinery of cartan - kahler theory  @xcite and will be presented in part  ii of @xcite .",
    "these ideas can be extended to complex manifolds as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the classical nonlinear sigma model is defined by a map @xmath2 from a lorentzian world sheet @xmath3 to a target manifold @xmath4 and some additional geometric data which specifies the lagrangian . in this article",
    "we will take the world sheet @xmath3 to be either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the first factor is time and the second factor is space .",
    "local coordinates on @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the target space @xmath4 is endowed with a metric tensor @xmath8 and a 2-form @xmath9 .",
    "the lagrangian density for this model is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the two dimensional lorentzian metric on the world sheet .",
    "a good way of denoting the sigma model is to use the notation @xmath12 which incorporates all the relevant geometrical data .",
    "the canonically conjugate momenta are given by @xmath13 local coordinates in phase space may be taken to be @xmath14 . if the spatial part of @xmath3 is a circle then @xmath14 is a loop in @xmath15 , the cotangent bundle of @xmath4 .",
    "if the spatial part of @xmath3 is @xmath16 then @xmath14 is a path in @xmath15 . the symplectic form on the phase space is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the differential on the phase space .",
    "with this symplectic structure we see that the basic poisson bracket is given by @xmath19 the hamiltonian density and the worldsheet momentum density are respectively given by @xmath20    target space duality is the phenomenon that a nonlinear sigma model @xmath12 is _ equivalent _ to a different nonlinear sigma model @xmath21 .",
    "we need to define _ equivalent_. for the moment we will make a preliminary definition which will be modified later .    [ oa - duality - prelim ] two sigma models @xmath12 and @xmath21 are said to be _ target space dual _ to each other if there exists a canonical transformation from the phase space of @xmath12 to the phase space of @xmath21 which maps the hamiltonian @xmath22 of the first model to the hamiltonian @xmath23 of the second model .",
    "later we will see that there are some important domain and range issues which must be addressed to have a good definition of target space duality .",
    "as an example of the above we consider the case where the target space is a circle of radius @xmath24 ( for a more detailed discussion look in @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath2 on the circle has period @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian density is given by @xmath26 we can define a _",
    "formal _ canonical transformation by the ordinary differential equations @xmath27 it is clear that the hamiltonian is preserved by this map .",
    "the new hamiltonian tells us that the new target space is either @xmath16 or @xmath28 .",
    "the transformation above is formal because of certain domain and range issues .",
    "first we note that there is an @xmath28 action on our circle given by translating @xmath2 .",
    "noether s theorem leads to the conserved target space momentum @xmath29 associated with translations in the target space . for the moment",
    "let us assume the world sheet is @xmath30 . in this case , the difference @xmath31 is quantized in units of @xmath32 where the winding number @xmath33 is an integer .",
    "consequently , phase space divides into sectors labeled by @xmath34 $ ] where @xmath33 is the winding number and @xmath35 is the total target space momentum .",
    "since both these quantities are conserved , the subspace labeled by @xmath34 $ ] will be invariant under the hamiltonian flow .",
    "this observation has important consequences when we examine the duality transformation in more detail . integrating equations  ( [ oa - can-1 ] ) and ( [ oa - can-2 ] )",
    "we see that : @xmath36 the above indicates that the dual target manifold should be a circle of radius @xmath37 and we should have relations @xmath38 and @xmath39 . since the winding number @xmath40 must be an integer we see that @xmath35 must be `` classically quantized '' and likewise @xmath41 . at the classical level we have the following : given two radii @xmath24 and @xmath37 , the sigma model with radius @xmath24 on the reduced phase space characterized by @xmath42 $ ]",
    "is dual to the sigma model on a circle of radius @xmath37 on the reduced phase space characterized by @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "note that some type of `` pre - quantization '' has taken place in trying to define duality .",
    "there is no `` good '' map from the full phase space of the nonlinear sigma model on a circle of radius @xmath24 to the nonlinear sigma model on a circle of radius @xmath37 . under quantization",
    "we observe that the momentum @xmath44 must be quantized in units of @xmath45 , likewise , the momentum @xmath46 must be quantized in units of @xmath47 .",
    "incorporating this we see that there is now a relation @xmath48 between @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that if we take @xmath49 then the winding number is not defined and the domain and range issues do not appear .",
    "the lesson learned in this example is that there are delicate domain and range issues which must be understood if one wants to be mathematically precise .",
    "preliminary definition  ( [ oa - duality - prelim ] ) must be expanded to include domain and range information .",
    "a better definition of classical duality would be    two sigma models @xmath12 and @xmath21 are said to be _ target space dual _ to each other if there exists a canonical transformation from a reduced phase space of @xmath12 to a reduced phase space of @xmath21 which maps the hamiltonian @xmath22 of the first model to the hamiltonian @xmath23 of the second model .",
    "the reduced phase spaces must be invariant under the respective hamiltonian flow .",
    "in this example we choose the target space to be an @xmath50-dimensional torus @xmath51 ( for a more detailed discussion look in @xcite ) .",
    "the metric @xmath52 and the 2-form @xmath53 are chosen to be constant .",
    "the basic poisson brackets for this model are given by equation  ( [ oa - poisson ] ) . by differentiating they",
    "may be written as @xmath54 if we now put @xmath55 and @xmath56 into a @xmath57-vector @xmath58 then the poisson brackets may be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 the indices @xmath61 and @xmath53 range over @xmath62 .",
    "we see that a constant linear transformation @xmath63 will preserve the symplectic structure if @xmath64 is in the pseudo - orthogonal group @xmath65 consisting of linear transformations which preserve the quadratic form @xmath66 .",
    "this group is isomorphic to @xmath67 .",
    "since the hamiltonian is a quadratic form in the @xmath68 s with constant coefficients , we see that a @xmath69 leads to a new sigma model hamiltonian with constant coefficients .",
    "a similar phenomenon will be studied in detail in a more general setting later . for the moment",
    "we make a few observations . since the hamiltonian a positive definite quadratic form in @xmath70 , the linear transformations in @xmath65 that preserve the quadratic form belong to a certain maximal compact subgroup @xmath71 which is isomorphic to @xmath72 .",
    "the dimension of the coset space @xmath73 is @xmath74 which is precisely the total number of independent components in the metric @xmath52 and the 2-form @xmath53 .",
    "in fact the coset space @xmath73 parameterizes the space of nonlinear sigma model hamiltonians with constant coefficients .",
    "actually one has to be careful in the quantum theory .",
    "one can show that transformations in the subgroup @xmath75 lead to equivalent hamiltonians .",
    "in this report we are interested in local conditions which necessarily guarantee the existence of a restricted type of target space duality .",
    "because we are only interested in local issues we will generally take @xmath49 .",
    "we revisit toroidal target spaces and adopt a different viewpoint which will generalize to generic targets .",
    "there is a very interesting structure which arises in the models we have been studying .",
    "introduce a new space isomorphic to @xmath76 with coordinates @xmath77 .",
    "define @xmath78 by @xmath79 note that there is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath77 due to the constant of integration .",
    "instead of working in phase space @xmath14 we can work in a space with coordinates @xmath80 . in terms of these new variables",
    "the symplectic form may be written as @xmath81 this symplectic form is degenerate .",
    "we have also discarded a surface term .",
    "we will ignore these technical issues .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath66 enters into this formulation of the symplectic form .",
    "also , a constant coefficient linear transformation @xmath69 acting on @xmath82 space will preserve this symplectic form . using the variables",
    "@xmath82 we can integrate equations  ( [ oa - can-1 ] ) , ( [ oa - can-2 ] ) , and obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants . in passing we mention that if @xmath86 and if we naively quantize then there will be appropriate periodicity requirements on @xmath82 and @xmath87 .",
    "the map @xmath88 between the toroidal target spaces @xmath89 induces transformations ( [ oa - int-1 ] ) and ( [ oa - int-2 ] ) on the space of paths .    the question which will occupy our attention throughout",
