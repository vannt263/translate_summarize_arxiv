    "discrete vortex methods ( dvm s ) are lagrangian methods for solving for rotational fluid flow in which the vorticity field is partitioned into a finite number of discrete vortex elements , and the evolution of the flow field is determined by following the motion of the vortex elements .",
    "one advantage of dvm s is that the computational effort is applied only in the regions of most interest .",
    "also , for flow past bodies , the far field conditions are automatically satisfied as the vorticity field will decay to zero away from the body , avoiding the problems that can occur when truncating the domain in grid based methods .    for two - dimensional inviscid flow",
    ", there is a single component of vorticity , and for inviscid flow , the elements are convected with constant strength at the local velocity of the fluid . for viscous flow ,",
    "some method of modelling the viscous diffusion must to added to the numerical scheme .",
    "a number of schemes have been developed .",
    "one of the first applications of a dvm for viscous flow @xcite used a random walk to model the viscous effects .",
    "a random walk is simple to apply but has relatively low resolution and produces noisy results .",
    "a more sophisticated method is the particle strength exchange ( pse ) method , introduced in @xcite , which models the viscous effects using integral operators .",
    "a related method is the vorticity redistribution method of shankar and van dommelen @xcite which , like pse , involves redistributing circulation between the elements , but does not require a regular mesh , introducing elements locally as required . a more recent redistribution .",
    "based on time dependent gaussian cores , is given by @xcite .",
    "a description of many aspects of vortex methods can be found in the book by cottet and koumoutsakos @xcite .",
    "also , a comparison of four viscous methods which do not require the introduction of a grid can be found in @xcite .",
    "many papers on vortex use the total force ( coefficients ) to assess the accuracy of the method but do not present details of the pointwise surface forces .",
    "these are frequently noisy due to the irregular distribution of vortex particles , as can be seen in @xcite , who use random walk for the diffusion .",
    "in fact , the total force can also be noisy and require smoothing , as in @xcite .",
    "in one of the benchmark papers using vortex methods , koumoutsakos and leonard @xcite do present plots of the surface pressure and vorticity , although they observe high frequency oscillations in the surface vorticity .",
    "koumoutsakos and leonard @xcite use the pse method for diffusion .",
    "pse involves the introduction of a grid to the scheme with frequent remeshing in order to maintain the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "it appears that the order introduced into the method by the remeshing helps smooth out the spurious high frequency oscillation in the forces that are found in some other methods .",
    "hence , a possible way of reducing the noise would be to remesh every time step with a pse method . however , an alternative is to combine the remeshing and diffusion operation in single step .",
    "this can be done by making the redistribution of the circulation satisfy certain constraints which have a physical meaning .",
    "this is a variation of the redistribution method of shankar and van dommelen @xcite , but rather than redistributing circulation between vortex elements , the circulation contained in each discrete vortex element is independently transferred onto a small set of neighbouring nodes .",
    "the solution for this redistribution problem can be written explicitly as a set of algebraic equations .",
    "the result is a simple , efficient scheme which maintains a regular distribution of vortex elements .",
    "the surface force can be calculated directly from local variables , showing very good agreement with test data .",
    "also , since this scheme works with the circulation of a vortex element , independent of the vorticity distribution in the element , there is no requirement for overlap of cores , as in the pse method .",
    "the paper is structured as follows ; first , an outline of the basic method is presented .",
    "this is followed by a description of the redistribution scheme .",
    "means of calculating the body forces are then discussed .",
    "a brief description of the finite - spectral code used to generate test data is given .",
    "test results are then presented for impulsively started flow past a cylinder and a square .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given .",
    "the two - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes equation in vorticity form is @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the velocity components in cartesian coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the time , @xmath4 the vorticity , @xmath5 the reynolds number , and @xmath6 the two - dimensional laplace operator .",
    "the velocity is normalised by the free stream velocity @xmath7 , the length scales by a characteristic length @xmath8 , and time by @xmath9 .",
    "the reynolds number is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 and fluid density and @xmath12 its dynamic viscosity .",
    "consider an individual vortex element centred on @xmath13 where @xmath14 gives the coordinates in complex form , with a vorticity distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 , where @xmath17 so that the distribution function has unit circulation . the vorticity field",
    "is represented by @xmath18 discrete vortex elements so that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the strength of vortex @xmath21 .",
    "the velocity generated by the vortex elements is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23    a number of different functions can be used for the vorticity distribution @xmath24 . in general , point vortices given by a delta function are not used .",
    "instead , a smooth distribution which does not have the numerical problems associated with point vortices is adopted .",
    "a standard distribution , used here , is the gaussian vortex , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a measure of the core size of a vortex .",
    "this gives @xmath27 \\label{lvv}\\ ] ]    as usual , the boundary conditions at the surface of the body are satisfied by the use of a vortex panel method .",
    "both standard straight , constant strength , vortex panels and the higher order panels given in @xcite in equation 16 ) is from a definite integral and should be the difference between the two terms not the sum of them . ]",
    "were investigated .",
    "the latter method uses overlapping curved panels with a linear distribution of vorticity along the panels .",
    "this allows an accurate representation of a smooth body and produces a velocity distribution which is singularity free . however , there was little difference in the results for the different panels for flow past a circular cylinder if enough panels were used .",
    "the cylinder results ( section [ cylinder_results ] ) presented below use the high order panels , but , because of the sharp corners , constant strength , straight panels were used for flow past a square ( section [ square_results ] ) .",
    "the velocity now consists of three components , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fluid velocity , @xmath30 is the free stream velocity , @xmath31 is the velocity generated by the vortex elements , and @xmath32 generated by the panels used to satisfy the boundary conditions at the surface of the body .",
    "numerically , an operator splitting method is used , with inviscid and viscous sub steps , satisfying @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the equation for the inviscid sub step represents the fact that for two - dimensional inviscid flow vorticity is convected by the flow .",
    "numerically , the element vortices are moved at the local fluid velocity , i.e.   @xmath35 a second order runge - kutta method is used to move the vortices at each time step @xmath36 @xmath37    a number of methods exist for the viscous sub step ( [ sub_v ] ) .",
    "the method developed here is based on the vorticity redistribution scheme of shankar and van dommelen @xcite . in this method , at each time the circulation of vortex elements are updated through @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the fraction of the circulation of vortex @xmath40 transferred to vortex @xmath21 by diffusion during time step @xmath41 .",
    "the summation is over a group of vortices local to @xmath42 , the position of vortex @xmath21 .",
    "the fractions @xmath39 are calculated to satisfy the following constraints @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the characteristic diffusion distance over time @xmath48 .",
    "stability requires @xmath49",
    ". equations ( [ vr_2]-[vr_5 ] ) enforce conservation of vorticity , the centre of vorticity , and linear and angular momentum .",
    "the redistribution is performed over all vortices within a distance @xmath50 of vortex @xmath40 , i.e. such that @xmath51 the accuracy of the method depends on the value of @xmath52 and a minimum value of @xmath53 is required for a first or second order solution to exist @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 was used in @xcite .",
    "a solution may not always exist , for example if there are less than six vortices within the region ( [ vr_6 ] ) .",
    "if no solution is found , new vortices are introduced a distance @xmath55 from the centre ( @xmath42 ) until a solution exists .",
    "further details of the method and its theoretical basis can be found in @xcite .    in this scheme ,",
    "all vortex elements satisfying ( [ vr_6 ] ) must be identified .",
    "the redistribution problem can then be solved using a linear programming method , for example the revised simplex scheme found in @xcite .",
    "the redistribution scheme above ( [ vr_1]-[vr_5 ] ) operates by transferring circulation between vortex elements , introducing new elements as required .",
    "however , an alternative is to transfer the circulation onto a set of nodes at known positions . consider a one - dimensional unsteady diffusion problem , with a uniform grid with grid step @xmath56 .",
    "suppose there is a vortex of strength @xmath57 placed at @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 then a solution of the redistribution equations is @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 where circulation @xmath65 is transferred to the grid point @xmath66 .",
    "all other @xmath67 are zero .",
    "a second solution is given by @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath71 for the other @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .    in principle either of these solutions could be used .",
    "however , consider the case when the element is midway between grid points , i.e.  @xmath74 . on physical grounds",
    ", the redistribution would be expected to be symmetric , but both of the solutions are asymmetric . a simple way of producing a symmetric solution in this case is to use the average of the two solutions , i.e.@xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "this gives the same solution as would be obtained by using the four points @xmath77 to @xmath78 and assuming symmetry ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "more generally , a linear combination of the two basic solutions , ( [ rd2]-[rd4 ] ) and ( [ rd5]-[rd7 ] ) , can be used @xmath81 this produces a symmetric three point solution if the element is at a grid point , and a symmetric four point solution if the element is midway between grid points , with a smooth change between these two extreme cases .",
    "it is the simplest solution which satisfies both the redistribution equations and symmetry .",
    "some test calculations have been performed for a circular cylinder case using using only three point formula ( ( [ rd2]-[rd4 ] ) for @xmath82 and ( [ rd5]-[rd7 ] ) for @xmath83 ) , but these produced undesirable short scale variations in the solution when a vortex element moved across a midpoint and the redistribution changed bias .",
    "this did not occur when using the combination ( [ rd8 ] ) .",
    "stability requires that the redistribution fractions are positive .",
    "the most restrictive case when using ( [ rd8 ] ) is when the element is at a grid point .",
    "the condition is then @xmath84    as simple test problem is that of one dimensional diffusion starting from a point distribution of vorticity at @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",
    "figure [ 1d_test ] shows the analytic and redistribution solutions for the vorticity for a test case at @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and total circulation of @xmath90 .",
    "the calculation was started from the analytic solution at @xmath91 .",
    "the grid step was @xmath92 and the time step was @xmath93 .",
    "two different grids were used in the calculation .",
    "there was an offset between the grids and they were used alternatively at successive time steps .",
    "a number of different offsets , ranging from @xmath94 to @xmath95 ) were tested , and the good agreement with the analytic solution shown in figure [ 1d_test ] is typical .     with @xmath89 , @xmath92 and @xmath96 .",
    "the solid line is the analytical solution and the symbols are from the redistribution scheme . ]",
    "consider now the two dimensional case in @xmath2 with grid @xmath60 and @xmath97 and a vortex element located at @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the one dimensional redistribution in the @xmath101 direction is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and the @xmath104 and @xmath105 are obtained as in ( [ rd2]-[rd7 ] ) .",
    "the two dimensional redistribution scheme is given by @xmath106 these weights satisfy all of the constraints in the original redistribution scheme ( [ vr_2]-[vr_5 ] ) .",
    "this solution of the redistribution problem satisfies shankar and van dommelen condition for the existence of a solution ; the simplest two - dimensional solution has a nine point stencil and the stability condition implies that the corner points of the stencil must be a distance of at least @xmath107 from the centre point .",
    "figure [ 2d_test ] shows typical constant vorticity contours for the two dimensional diffusion problem .",
    "again , two offset grids were used .",
    "the contours shown are from the numerical solution . at the scale",
    "shown they are identical to the contours from the analytic solution .",

    "the standard case of flow past a circular cylinder will be used as a test for the method . the obvious grid to use in this case is one using polar coordinates @xmath109 . however",
    ", the original redistribution equations must be converted to the appropriate form .",
    "transforming between polar and cartesian coordinates in standard form @xmath110 , @xmath111 , write @xmath112    substituting ( [ polar_1 ] ) into ( [ vr_3]-[vr_5 ] ) and expanding , while retaining all terms @xmath113 ) or greater , produces the constraints @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117    equations ( [ polar_2]-[polar_5 ] ) are analogous to the original constants ( [ vr_3]-[vr_5 ] ) with the cartesian lengths replaced by the polar ones ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) apart from the linear radial constraint ( [ polar_2 ] ) which has a nonzero right side .",
    "this term arises from the @xmath120 in the polar laplace operator ; setting the right side of ( [ polar_2 ] ) to zero would produce a nonphysical result in which the diffusion operator is @xmath121 .",

    ". the azimuthal redistribution solution is obtained from ( [ rd2]-[rd6 ] ) with the lengths replaced by @xmath131 . again , linear combinations of the redistribution solutions are formed , and the two dimensional redistribution scheme obtained as in ( [ rd11 ] ) .      above the redistribution method",
    "has been presented for cartesian and polar coordinates system .",
    "the method extends to other , more general , systems .",
    "for example , for a transformation given by @xmath132 , the condition for first moment in @xmath133 becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 and the other equations are obtained by replacing @xmath136 by @xmath137 .",
    "further , the redistribution problem can formulated for a general grid with fixed nodes by calculating the appropriate terms , a procedure equivalent to calculating the metric terms scaling the derivatives in the diffusion operator in a finite volume method .",
    "the full scheme is a fractional step algorithm consisting of the following steps     1 .",
    "redistribution onto a fixed grid over a time step of @xmath138 .",
    "convection of the vortex elements using the two - step runge - kutta scheme ( [ rk_step1],[rk_step2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   redistribution onto a fixed grid over a time step of @xmath138    a method for diffusing vorticity from the surface where it is created must be incorporated into this scheme .",
    "a number of methods can be found in the literature .",
    "the simplest is to create new vortex elements a small distance off the boundary , as in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite solve a diffusion problem using the flux of vorticity from the surface as a boundary condition . in @xcite ,",
    "the redistribution method is used to diffuse vorticity from the vortex sheet on the boundary into the interior .",
    "the last approach is the one used here , in the simplest manner consistent with the algorithm .",
    "the circulation from the vortex panels created at the start of step 2 is placed on a set of points on the boundary ( the control points used to calculated the strengths of the vortex panels ) , and these are used as new vortex elements added to the redistribution of step 3 .",
    "all circulation distributed across the boundary during the redistribution steps is reflected back across the boundary , ensuring conservation of circulation and imposing a no flux boundary condition .",
    "the standard way to calculate the lift and drag with a dvm is to use the impulse ( see e.g.  @xcite ) - @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the drag and lift normalised by @xmath142 where @xmath8 is a reference length . the summation is performed over the entire domain @xmath143 for all circulation carrying elements .",
    "the surface pressure can be related to the strength of the vortex panels @xcite through @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the circulation carried by the relevant portion of the wall .",
    "the wall shear stress is obtained by using a finite difference formula with velocity components evaluated at fixed points near the surface . for the circular cylinder ,",
    "the redistribution grid has @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "the shear is calculated using the velocity at midpoints through the one sided , second order formula @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the azimuthal velocity .",
    "there are a large number of papers which use flow past a circular cylinder as a test case .",
    "however , in most of these only the lift and drag ( coefficients ) are presented . to provide",
    "detailed data for comparison , a finite difference - spectral ( fds ) code was used .",
    "the streamfunction - vorticity formulation is used , with governing equations the vorticity transport equation ( [ ns ] ) , and the poisson equation for the streamfunction @xmath150",
    "@xmath151    fourier modes were used in @xmath152 , and second order central difference formula in the radial direction .",
    "a one sided backwards difference formula , similar to ( [ ss_force ] ) , was used for the time derivative , except for the first time step where a backwards euler scheme was used .",
    "the code is fully implicit , iterating to obtain the solution at each time step .",
    "the radial grid was stretched to give a fine grid near the cylinder , and place the outer boundary of the computational domain a long way from the surface .",
    "the non - linear terms were handled in the usual pseudo - spectral manner .    with an impulsive start",
    "the boundary layer grows as @xmath153 .",
    "this scaling was used for the earlier part of the computation , with @xmath154 the calculation was switched to a fixed grid at @xmath155 , using the radial distribution from ( [ t_scale_1 ] ) at this time .",
    "this produces a relatively simple but efficient code in which high accuracy can be obtained by using a large number of fourier modes and radial grid points and a small time step .",
    "grids of up to 1024 complex fourier modes , 2000 radial points , and a time step of @xmath156 were used for the data presented below .",
    "grid independence was checked for all reynolds numbers .    on the surface of the cylinder",
    "@xmath157 which can be used to calculate the surface pressure using a reference value of zero at the front of the cylinder .",
    "this equation is analogous to ( [ press_force ] ) for the dvm .",
    "both relate the flux of vorticity from the surface to the pressure gradient .",
    "the results produced by this code compare well with those found in other high resolution simulation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "also , they agree with the short time series solutions given by @xcite .",
    "as a test case for the effects of the numerical parameters and grid on the accuracy of the solution , the drag for the flow past an impulsively started cylinder for short time will be used .",
    "lengths are scaled or the diameter of the cylinder @xmath158 so that the surface of the cylinder is at @xmath159 , the vorticity is scaled by @xmath160 where @xmath7 is the free stream velocity , and the time is scaled by @xmath161 .",
    "the reynolds number is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "a body fitted polar grid is used in the region @xmath164 .",

    "the inner grid is arranged so that the surface of the cylinder falls midway between radial grid points , with @xmath146 where @xmath166 is the radial grid step , so that the surface is at @xmath167 .",

    "the end of the vortex panels are at @xmath170 , with the control points for the evaluation of the boundary velocity at @xmath171 .    the method does not explicitly allow for the @xmath172 behaviour for small time , so the solution can not be expected to be accurate over the first few time steps .",
    "however , with an appropriate choice of parameters , solutions which achieve high accuracy after a few time steps can be obtained .",
    "there are six numerical parameters which must be chosen .",
    "the grid steps in @xmath173 and @xmath152 for the inner grid , the grid step @xmath56 for the outer grid ( a square grid is used here although this is not required ) , the region for the inner grid ( @xmath174 ) , the time step @xmath48 and the core size @xmath26 .",
    "the maximum time step is fixed by the stability of the redistribution scheme .",
    "since the algorithm has two redistribution substeps over time @xmath175 , the stability condition becomes @xmath176 , or @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the smallest of the three grid steps @xmath166 , @xmath179 and @xmath56 .",
