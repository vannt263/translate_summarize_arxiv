    "the tunneling time problem has remained a controversial issue after the question of how long it takes a particle to traverse a classically forbidden region , was raised 70 years ago @xcite .",
    "there are a number of approaches to this problem @xcite . in this paper , an unexpected close relationship is found between a real time feynman path integral approach @xcite and the quantum shutter approach @xcite , which are , at first sight , unlikely to be related .",
    "if we use the real time feynman path integrals @xcite , we can define the `` amplitude distribution `` of tunneling time as the sum of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the action ) over the paths that take a specified amount of time to traverse the barrier region . with the amplitude distribution",
    ", we can deal with the interesting question whether or not a probability distribution is definable for tunneling time @xcite .",
    "the definability of the probability distribution depends on whether or not the amplitude distribution has the property of orthogonality , i.e. , whether or not the classes of feynman paths taking time @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) to traverse the region interfere . for rectangular barriers ,",
    "one of the authors studied the interference quantitatively to conclude that ( i ) a probability distribution is not definable @xcite but ( ii ) the range of the values of tunneling time is definable @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a function @xmath7 is introduced to analyze how different classes of feynman paths ( each class being characterized by the value of @xmath8 ) contribute to the tunneling process .",
    "the function @xmath7 was used to prove the undefinability of the probability distribution and also to estimate the range of the tunneling times . for typical opaque barriers ,",
    "the graph of @xmath7 showed a peaked structure near the bttiker - landauer time @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that @xmath7 is an important quantity for the study of the tunneling time problem .",
    "it is however important to understand how @xmath7 is related to the dynamics of tunneling , which is not evident at all from the feynman paths construction of @xmath7 . in the present paper",
    ", we will relate @xmath7 ( to be precise , @xmath9 as discussed below ) to a time - dependent wave function .",
    "now , we have to quickly add the following : in general , a feynman path crosses the barrier region many times , so that we can define `` the amount of time taken by a feynman path to traverse the barrier region '' in several ways . we can define it as the sum of the times during which the feynman path is within the barrier region @xcite , which may be called the resident time of the feynman path . or",
    ", we can define it as the last time the path leaves the barrier region minus the first time it enters the region @xcite , which may be called the passage time of the feynman path .",
    "these two different definitions at the level of feynman paths would lead to physically different tunneling times , which we shall call the tunneling time of resident time type ( _ resident time _ for short ) and the tunneling time of passage time type ( _ passage time _ for short ) .",
    "reference @xcite concerns the resident time , while refs .",
    "@xcite and this paper concern the passage time .",
    "we shall attach , if necessary , subscript @xmath10 to the quantities for the resident time ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) and subscript @xmath12 for the passage time ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) .",
    "another novel approach , relevant to the tunneling time problem@xcite , is to consider an analytic time - dependent solution to schrdinger s equation with the initial condition at @xmath13 of an incident cutoff wave , to investigate the time evolution of the probability density through an arbitrary potential barrier .",
    "this problem may be visualized as a _ gedanken experiment _ consisting of a shutter , situated at @xmath14 , that separates a beam of particles from a potential barrier located in the region @xmath15 . at @xmath13",
    "the shutter is opened , and the probability density rises initially from a vanishing value and evolves with time through @xmath16 . at the barrier edge @xmath17 , the probability density at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 ,",
    "yields the probability of finding the particle after a time @xmath18 has elapsed .",
    "since initially there is no particle along the tunneling region , detecting the particle at the barrier edge at time @xmath18 should provide a relevant time scale of the tunneling process . in recent work ,",
    "two of the authors @xcite analyzed the time evolution of the probability density @xmath1 for a rectangular potential barrier using the above formalism .",
    "there , it was found that the probability density at the right barrier edge @xmath17 , exhibits at short times a transient structure that they named _ time - domain resonance_. the maximum of the time - domain resonance , occurring at a time @xmath20 , represents the largest probability of finding the particle at @xmath17 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the above authors called the attention of the readers to the fact that the shape of the graph of @xmath1 depicted in fig .",
    "1 of that paper resembles the average shape of the graph in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the graph of @xmath11",
    ". then they guessed that @xmath1 would be more related to the passage time rather than the resident time .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , yamada has studied @xmath9 to find that , if @xmath8 is simply replaced by @xmath18 , the graph of @xmath9 for a monochromatic case is actually indistinguishable from the graph of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the transmission amplitude .",
    "however , there has been no explicit proof that these two functions are really equivalent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that the function @xmath9 and the probability density @xmath1 under the initial condition stated above are actually related by @xmath23 thereby establishing a surprising relationship between the two approaches . as a by - product of our proof to eq .",
    "( [ yeq:7 ] ) , we present an alternative derivation , along the transmitted region , of the expression for @xmath24 without using the laplace transform method . this derivation is the second purpose of the present paper .",
