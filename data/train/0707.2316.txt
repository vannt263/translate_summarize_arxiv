    "galaxy redshift surveys have played a significant role in constraining the cosmological model , with the largest surveys to date having been performed by the 2dfgrs and sdss teams using optical techniques .",
    "low redshift samples have been used for some time to derive constraints on cosmological parameter combinations @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the total matter and baryon densities defined relative to critical , and @xmath10 , as well as the spectral index of the density fluctuations , @xmath4 , and neutrino densities  @xcite .",
    "more recently the sdss team have used a more sparsely sampled , but larger volume survey of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) to measure the expected baryon acoustic peak on scales of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "since the acoustic scale is a standard ruler , this provides a distance measurement allowing further constraints to be placed on cosmological parameters and , in particular , those which parametrize the properties of the dark energy .",
    "a large number of projects have been proposed recently to develop these ideas and to perform large photometric surveys in the optical ( and possibly the infra - red ) waveband to find @xmath12 galaxies out to @xmath13 ( dark energy survey ; des ) , as well as deeper spectroscopic surveys to find @xmath14 galaxies at @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "such surveys will have much larger search volumes than those presently available , allowing for significantly more accurate measurements of the power spectrum and hence of the acoustic scale at a variety of redshifts .",
    "this could lead to very tight constraints on the properties of the dark energy .",
    "another promising technique is to use the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen ( hi ) as a tracer of the galaxies allowing for a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey  @xcite",
    ". this will require the development of telescopes with much higher survey speed , and hence a combination of larger collecting area and field - of - view ( fov ) , than those available at present .",
    "the current state - of - the - art is a shallow all - sky survey ; the combined hipass  @xcite and hijass  @xcite survey , which has found @xmath16 galaxies .",
    "fortunately , a world - wide technology development programme is underway with the ultimate aim of building a square kilometre array ( ska ) with collecting area @xmath17 and a fov much greater than @xmath18 , with these specifications the ska surveys may detect @xmath19 galaxies .",
    "before the full ska comes into operation ( @xmath20 ) another large radio telescope will have been constructed which also has great potential for hi surveys .",
    "the five - hundred - metre aperture spherical telescope ( fast ) will be an arecibo - like telescope with a significantly larger aperture ( @xmath21 ) and fov  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the scientific potential of a low - redshift hi survey of galaxies as a fast key science programme .",
    "we will show that , if a focal plane array with 100 instantaneous beams can be developed , @xmath0 galaxies can be detected within a realistic survey period ( @xmath22 years ) and that the low - redshift galaxy power spectrum can be measured much more accurately than is currently possible with optical surveys .",
    "since hydrogen is the fundamental baryonic constituent of the universe such a survey would provide an important view of the large - scale structure of the universe with different biases and be an important stepping stone to the larger hi galaxy surveys which will become possible with the ska .    in the next section we will briefly discuss some relevant observational parameters of fast and then in subsequent sections",
    ", we will estimate the number counts , make forecasts for errors on the power spectrum and constraints on cosmological parameters that could be possible with such a survey .",
    "the fast telescope is funded and when completed in around 2012 - 2013 it will be the largest single dish telescope in the world .",
    "the expected specifications of the telescope  @xcite relevant to our discussion here are :    * the prime - focus feed illuminates an area corresponding to a parabolic dish of diameter @xmath23 with aperture efficiency of @xmath24 giving @xmath25 , * at 21 cm wavelength the beam width ( fwhm ) @xmath26 arcmin ; the effective pixel ( equating the volume of a cube of height unity to the integral under a gaussian beam with the same height ) has side 1.064@xmath27 and area 1.133@xmath28 . *",
    "the maximum observable zenith angle is of order @xmath29 allowing the observation of @xmath30 of the full sky without significant degradation of performance .",
    "henceforth , the ` full sky ' is defined to be the maximum amount of sky accessible to the telescope i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "* one of the principal receiver systems will be a focal plane array covering a frequency range around 1.4 ghz ( the 21-cm hi line ) which can produce @xmath32 instantaneous beams each with a system temperature @xmath33 ( hence @xmath34 per beam ) and dual polarization capability .",
    "the expected thermal noise for a dual polarization single beam can be computed using @xmath35 for an observing time of @xmath36 and a frequency bandwidth of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "if we assume a bandwidth of @xmath39 which corresponds to a velocity linewidth of @xmath40 at 21 cm then the instantaneous sensitivity of each beam of the fast system will be @xmath41 .",
    "the focal ratio of the telescope ( @xmath42 ) restricts @xmath32 to @xmath43 for a conventional close - packed horn - based array , similar to that used for hipass and operated at the prime focus .",
    "larger arrays require some of the horns to be far enough off - axis that aberration losses become unacceptable .",
    "a 19-beam array gives an instantaneous fov of @xmath44 .",
    "we will use this 19-beam system as the fiducial benchmark for our basic calculations .",
    "a receiver array with @xmath45 may well be possible .",
    "this requirement could only be met with close - packed phased arrays of small antenna elements ; these would not take up much more area than the 19-beam horn system .",
    "the required phased array technology is actively being developed by several groups working within the international square kilometre array r&d effort and hence we can be confident that by the time fast comes into operation in 2012 - 3 the 100-beam receiver capability will be available .",
    "this would allow for @xmath46 .",
    "such a system will be at least twice as sensitive per beam as that on the arecibo telescope and have a survey speed ( @xmath47 ) which is at least @xmath48 times faster than the 7-beam system presently available there .",
    "fast will also have more frequency flexibility due to the excellent rfi enviroment at the fast site and will be able to observe twice the area of the sky than does the arecibo telescope .",
    "the hi mass , @xmath49 , of a galaxy at redshift @xmath50 is given in terms of the observed flux , @xmath51 , and line width , @xmath52 , by  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the luminosity distance to the galaxy .",
    "we note that this formula is usually quoted in terms of the euclidean distance and without the @xmath55 ; this is the correct formula in an frw universe .",
    "one can estimate the number of galaxies above some limiting mass @xmath56 by computing @xmath57 where the sky area covered is @xmath58 and the size of the redshift bin is @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is the comoving volume element for the frw universe and @xmath61 is the comoving number density of galaxies per unit mass which we shall assume can be approximated by a schechter function @xmath62\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will , for the most part , assume no evolution in the hi mass function out to the moderate redshifts appropriate for a fast survey and , therefore , use values of the parameters derived from the most recent survey of the local universe  @xcite . in particular , we will choose @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "one can compute the average redshift of galaxies in the survey from @xmath66 by integrating appropriately over @xmath50 , that is , @xmath67    in order to compute the limiting mass of the survey we will make a point source approximation , that is , we will assume that each galaxy detected will be smaller than the telescope beam , and hence , all the flux it emits will contribute to a single beam .",
    "this is likely to be a good approximation for most objects in the survey , but will break down for the closest , most massive objects .",
    "we expect those objects which violate this assumption to be the minority if we choose the survey strategy sensibly .",
    "there is an empirically derived relation between the hi diameter , @xmath68 , which is defined to be the region inside which the hi surface density is greater than @xmath69 , and the hi mass of a galaxy .",
    "this can be used to investigate the extent to which the point source approximation is valid .",
    "we will use  @xcite @xmath70 which has been converted to an angular scale using the angular diameter distance @xmath71 for the range of relevant hi masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : rda ] .",
    "we note immediately that at @xmath72 massive galaxies containing @xmath73 of hi will be resolved by the fast beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rda ] ) but we postpone more detailed discussion of the validity of the point source assumptions to later in section b.    the beam area increases like @xmath74 . as a result",
    "if an optimal survey strategy , in which one uniformly tiles the @xmath2 slice , is chosen then slices of the survey at higher redshift receive extra exposure due to the fact that these slices will overlap .",
    "the effect has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the flux limit relevant to a particular redshift slice is reduced by @xmath55 .",
    "hence , the flux limit for an observation , @xmath75 , for a specific signal - to - noise ratio @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 a given object is detectable if its flux density in bandwidth @xmath78 is greater than @xmath75 .",
    ".[tab1 ] predicted number counts with @xmath79 in one day of observation using a receiver system with @xmath80 for a range of observation strategies .",
    "counts expected for longer observations , or for larger numbers of beams , can be computed using a simple linear scaling .",
    "the limiting fluxes are computed using eqn .",
    "[ eq : fluxlimit ] with @xmath2 .",
    "all numbers have been rounded to 2 significant figures . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "an early phase of the ska with , say , @xmath81 of the total collecting area ( that is , an effective collecting area of @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 larger than fast ) and a fov of at least @xmath84 ( that is more than three times larger than the 100-beam case ) is likely to come into operation during the first five years of fast operation .",
    "it is interesting to compare and contrast the likely performance of such an early - stage ska relative to fast .",
    "we will assume that , for hi observations , the value of @xmath85 for the 10% ska is the same as for fast ( we note that it is likely to be slightly higher , but not appreciably so ; our results can be scaled by @xmath86 where appropriate ) .",
    "the angular resolution will , however , be much higher since the baselines on the ska `` core '' will extend out to @xmath87 km and hence the synthesised beam will be @xmath88 arcsec .",
    "this introduces an extra complication into predicting the number counts since many galaxies may be resolved and hence use of the point source approximation will overestimate the number of objects detected , particularly for shallow surveys .    in order to model this effect",
    "we have introduced an upper limit in the integral in eqn .",
    "[ eq : zeroth ] which is defined as the mass of object at a specific redshift which is resolved by the telescope beam .",
    "of course , this then underestimates the number of objects found since some resolved objects are always found in any survey .",
    "however , the number which are missed by this procedure are likely to be small since the vast majority of detections are just above mass threshold .",
    "the number of detections expected in one day are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tenpercent ] for a range of angular resolutions between 6 and 24 arcsec as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "included also for comparison are predictions for fast with 19 and 100 beams .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the fast curves are almost straight lines which peak at the lowest possible value of @xmath89 confirming our earlier assertion that the best observing strategy for fast , in terms of the number of objects detected , is to choose the value of @xmath89 so that one would cover the whole sky available to fast in a defined survey time .",
    "the curves for the 10% ska have a very different shape , following a line similar to that for the fast case for large values of @xmath89 before eventually turning over and plumetting to zero .",
    "this is the effect of the finite resolution , with the maximum being where the majority of objects found in a survey fill the beam exactly .",
    "it is clear to see that for @xmath90 the 10% ska would make most of its detections in the point source regime for @xmath91 .",
    "a higher resolution is more likely and if we consider the case of 12 arcsec resolution then the optimum value of @xmath92 , but in terms of the number of objects found per day it is only marginally more powerful than for fast with @xmath93 . for higher resolution still",
    "the optimal value of @xmath89 increases to around @xmath94 at 6 arcsec . in this case",
    ", one would be performing a much deeper survey which might capable of probing power spectrum at much higher redshifts and constraining the dark energy using the baryonic acoustic oscillations .",
    "it would certainly be very different in nature to that which we have proposed for fast  @xcite .    to summarize",
    "if the 10% stage of the ska has relatively low resolution and a fov of @xmath95 deg@xmath96 then it will be a factor of a few times more powerful than fast , in terms of the number of galaxies found at relatively low redshifts .",
    "but if it has much higher angular resolution then the survey which it will yield will be dominated by objects at much higher redshifts .",
    "if this were to be the case the fast and 10% ska would be complementary .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the upcoming fast is an extremely capable instrument for large - scale neutral hydrogen surveys over the whole sky with the potential for large numbers of galaxies being discovered daily in the redshift range @xmath97 and tens of galaxies out to mid - redshifts of order @xmath98 .",
    "this would provide complementary information to the redshift surveys already performed at optical wavelengths and would be considerably better than those presently available ( or likely to be available in the near future ) selected using neutral hydrogen as the tracer .",
    "in calculating the number of galaxies expected we have taken into account the effect of different angles of inclination for the galaxies to the observer and shown that an increase of @xmath99 is expected over simplistic approaches .",
    "essentially the increase arises from the detection of face - on galaxies which are otherwise neglected .",
    "a first - order estimate has also been made of the effect of the evolution of the hydrogen mass of a galaxy by means of a toy model based on a linear increase in the mass of @xmath100 with redshift .",
    "although simplistic this nevertheless indicates that quite conservative increases in the neutral hydrogen content of a galaxy with redshift can lead to a factor of two increase in the expected number counts . this would lead to reductions in errors of the power spectrum due to shot noise , although we have not used this evolving hi mass function for the cosmological parameter constraints of section  [ sec : errorforecasts ] .",
    "prior to the main fast survey we have suggested a deep , month - long survey to investigate these evolution effects by estimating the hi mass function out to @xmath101 .    for the fast hi galaxy survey to be a major improvement over current optical surveys it will be necessary to detect @xmath0 galaxies over @xmath102 deg@xmath96",
    ", most of which will lie within redshifts of a few tenths .",
    "a uniformly sampled @xmath103 hi galaxy survey will allow nearly an order of magnitude improvement of cosmological parameter constraints than currently provided by sdss .",
    "for example the fast survey will , independent of cmb observations , constrain @xmath104 to 7% and @xmath6 to 5% .",
    "used in conjunction with observations of the cmb made by planck this could reduce the volume of the overall cosmological parameter space .",
    "we have shown , however , that to achieve this performance in a reasonable time ( @xmath22 years ) a receiving system providing of order 100 beams is necessary .",
    "conventional horn - based systems with physical limits to their packing density are restricted to @xmath105 beams at the fast prime focus and hence the 100-beam requirement can only be met with close - packed phased arrays of small antenna elements ; these would not take up much more area than the 19-beam horn system .",
    "the required phased array technology is actively being developed by several groups working on technology for the ska and hence we can be confident that by the time fast comes into operation in 2012 - 2013 the 100-beam receiver capability will be available .",
    "we have briefly looked ahead to the first phase of the ska and compared the shallower fast surveys with those from the much higher resolution interferometric surveys which will come somewhat later than that from fast .",
    "the fast and early - ska surveys are complementary with the higher resolution ska surveys preferentially finding higher redshift objects .",
    "ard is supported by a stfc studentship .",
    "we would like to thank nan rendong and bo peng for helpful comments ."
