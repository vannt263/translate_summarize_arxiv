    "the study of nuclear spin isomers of molecules was started by the discovery of the ortho and para hydrogen in the late 1920 s @xcite .",
    "it became clear already in that time that many other symmetrical molecules should have nuclear spin isomers too .",
    "nevertheless , their investigation has been postponed by almost 60 years .",
    "the reason for this delay was severe difficulties in the enrichment of spin isomers .",
    "the situation is improving now ( see the review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but yet we are at the very early stage of this research : in addition to the well - known spin isomers of h@xmath2 only a few molecules have been investigated so far . among them ,",
    "the ch@xmath1f nuclear spin isomers occupy a special place being the most studied and understood .",
    "the conversion of ch@xmath1f nuclear spin isomers has been explained @xcite in the framework of _ quantum relaxation _ @xcite . which is based on the intramolecular ortho - para state mixing and on the interruption of this mixing by collisions .",
    "this mechanism of spin conversion has a few striking features .",
    "the nuclear spin states of ch@xmath1f appeared to be extremely stable surviving @xmath3 collisions .",
    "each of the collision changes the energy of the molecule by @xmath4  @xmath5 and shuffles the molecular rotational state substantially .",
    "nevertheless , the model predicts that the spin conversion is governed by tiny intramolecular interactions having the energy",
    "@xmath6  @xmath5 .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the validity of the proposed theoretical model should be checked with great care .",
    "this is especially important because the ch@xmath1f case gives us the first evidence of the new mechanism behind the nuclear spin conversion in molecules .",
    "hydrogen spin conversion , which is the only other comprehensively studied case , is due to the completely different process based on direct collisional transitions between ortho and para states of h@xmath2 .    presently there is substantial amount of the experimental data on ch@xmath1f isomer conversion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "theory and experiment on the ch@xmath1f isomer conversion were compared in a number of papers but these comparisons were never aimed to determine a complete set of parameters necessary for _ a quantitative _ description of the process .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct such self - consistent theoretical model of the ch@xmath1f isomer conversion .",
    "the ch@xmath1f molecule is a symmetric top having the c@xmath7 symmetry .",
    "the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei in the molecule can be equal to @xmath8 ( ortho isomers ) , or @xmath9 ( para isomers ) .",
    "the values of the molecular angular momentum projection on the molecular symmetry axis ( @xmath10 ) are specific for these spin isomers .",
    "only @xmath10 divisible by 3 are allowed for the ortho isomers .",
    "all other @xmath10 are allowed for the para isomers .",
    "consequently , the rotational states of ch@xmath1f form two subspaces which are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for the particular case of the @xmath0ch@xmath1f molecules .",
    "let us briefly recall the physical picture of the ch@xmath1f spin conversion by quantum relaxation .",
    "suppose that a test molecule was placed initially in the ortho subspace of the molecular states ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . due to collisions in the bulk",
    "the test molecule will undergo fast rotational relaxation _ inside _ the ortho subspace .",
    "this running up and down along the ortho ladder proceeds until the molecule reaches the ortho state @xmath11 which is mixed with the para state @xmath12 by the _",
    "perturbation @xmath13 . then , during the free flight just after this collision , the perturbation @xmath13 mixes the para state @xmath12 with the ortho state @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the next collision is able to move the molecule to other para states and thus to localize it inside the para subspace .",
    "such mechanism of spin isomer conversion was proposed in the theoretical paper @xcite .",
    "the quantum relaxation of spin isomers can be quantitatively described in the framework of the kinetic equation for density matrix @xcite .",
    "let us consider first a free molecule which is not subjected to an external field .",
    "one needs to split the molecular hamiltonian into two parts @xmath14 where the main part of the hamiltonian , @xmath15 , has pure ortho and para states as the eigenstates ; the perturbation @xmath13 mixes the ortho and para states . in the first order perturbation theory the nuclear spin conversion rate , @xmath16 , is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the decay rate of the off - diagonal density matrix element @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the energy gap between the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the boltzmann factors of the corresponding states .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are crucial for the quantitative theoretical description of the @xmath0ch@xmath1f spin isomer conversion .",
    "all previous comparisons between the experiment on the ch@xmath1f spin conversion and the theory were performed using _",
    "`` total '' _ rates of conversion which summarize all contributions to the rate from many ortho - para level pairs .",
    "the `` total '' rate is just a single number and obviously can not provide unambiguous determination of all parameters which are present in the expression ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "one may combine the experimental data on `` total '' rates with theoretical calculations of some parameters but it is not easy . in this case one has to perform extensive calculations of the intramolecular ortho - para state mixing .",
    "even more difficult is to calculate the decoherence rates @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , development of the self - consistent model of the nuclear spin conversion in which all parameters are unambiguously determined should be based on a different approach .",
    "theoretical model of spin conversion predicts strong dependence of the conversion rate , @xmath16 , on the level spacing @xmath26 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) . this can be used to single out the contribution to the conversion from each level pair which should substantially simplify the quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite and performed in @xcite to use the stark effect for crossing the ortho and para states of ch@xmath1f .",
    "these crossings result in sharp increase of the conversion rate @xmath16 giving the conversion spectra if electric field is varied .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "it is evident that such spectrum contains much more information than the `` total '' conversion rate which is just a single number .",
    "comparison of the conversion spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with the theory needs a modification of the model in order to incorporate the stark effect .",
    "homogeneous electric field lifts partially the degeneracy of the @xmath22-states of ch@xmath1f ( see appendix ) .",
    "the new states , @xmath27-basis , can be found in a standard way @xcite : @xmath28 because electric field in the experiment is relatively small , it is sufficient to consider only diagonal matrix elements of the stark perturbation over angular momentum @xmath29 when calculating the @xmath27-states . energy of the @xmath27-states are given by the expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy of free molecule ; @xmath32 is the molecular permanent electric dipole moment ; @xmath33 is the electric field strength .",
    "the new states are still degenerate with respect to the spin projections @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and to the sign of @xmath37 .",
    "an account of the stark effect in the spin conversion model is straightforward .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) should be rewritten in the @xmath27-basis with the level energies determined by the eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) .",
    "nuclear spin conversion in @xmath0ch@xmath1f at zero electric field is governed almost completely by mixing of only two level pairs ( @xmath38=11 ,  @xmath39=1)(@xmath29=9 ,  @xmath10=3 ) and ( 21,1)(20,3 ) @xcite . the spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is produced by crossings of the @xmath37-sublevels of the para ( 11,1 ) and ortho ( 9,3 ) states .",

    "there is no contribution to the mixing of this level pair from the spin - rotation interaction because of the selection rule for spin - rotation interaction @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "contrary to that , the spin - rotation interaction in ch@xmath1f is known only approximately . for more details on spin - rotation contribution to the ch@xmath1f spin conversion",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite    the second pair of ortho - para states ( 21,1)(20,3 ) , which is also important for the spin conversion in @xmath0ch@xmath1f at zero electric field , is mixed by both the spin - spin and spin - rotation interactions .",
    "the magnitude of the latter is presently unknown .",
    "nevertheless , it does not complicate the fitting procedure because in the vicinity of the ( 11,1)(9,3 ) resonances presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the ( 21,1)(20,3 ) pair gives very small and almost constant contribution .",
    "let us find out now an analytical expression for modelling the experimental data .",

    "the level pair ( 21,1)(20,3 ) contributes nearly 30% to the total conversion rate @xcite . at electric fields ,",
    "where @xmath41 has peaks , this contribution is on the order of 10@xmath55 in comparison with @xmath41 .",

    "it was found out after the experiment @xcite was performed that the thickness of the glue used to attach the stark electrodes was not negligible .",
    "the updated spacing between the electrodes in the stark cell is @xmath59  mm .",
    "such correction of the spacing gives 1% systematic decrease of the experimental electric field values given in @xcite .",
    "this shift is taken into account in fig .",
    "let us compare the parameters obtained in the previous section with their theoretical estimates .",
    "we start from the analysis of the level spacing @xmath51 .",
    "the best sets of the ground state molecular parameters of @xmath0ch@xmath1f are given in ref .",
    "the spacing between the levels ( 11,1 ) and ( 9,3 ) is presented in the table  1 where the set having most accurate molecular parameter @xmath60 was used .",

    "the difference between them is @xmath61 which is less than 1% in comparison with @xmath51 itself .",
    "next , we calculate the parameter @xmath44 which characterizes the spin - spin mixing of the level pair ( 11,1)(9,3 ) in @xmath0ch@xmath1f .",

    ".    for the spin - spin mixing of the ortho and para states in @xmath0ch@xmath1f one has to take into account the interaction between the three hydrogen nuclei ( @xmath70 ) , between the three hydrogen and fluorine nuclei ( @xmath71 ) , and between the three hydrogen and carbon nuclei ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "we used the ground state structure of @xmath0ch@xmath1f determined in @xcite : @xmath85   , @xmath86   , and @xmath87 .",
    "the numbers in parentheses represent the error bars in units of the last digit . by using these parameters",
    "one can obtain the value of @xmath44 which is given in the table  1 .",
    "the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath44 is equal to @xmath88",
    "small difference between the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath51 unambigiously confirms that the mixed ortho - para level pair ( 9,3)(11,1 ) was determined correctly . from the spectroscopical data @xcite one can conclude that there are no other ortho - para level pairs which can mimic the level spacing @xmath89  mhz .",
    "it is also true if one takes into account even all ortho - para level pairs ignoring the restrictions imposed by the selection rules for the ortho - para state mixing .",
    "the difference between experimental and theoretical values of the level spacing at zero electric field , @xmath51 , is only @xmath90  mhz .",
    "the main error in theoretical value of @xmath51 is caused by the error in the molecular parameter @xmath60 .",
    "it gives nearly half of the error indicated in the table  1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath10 dependences of the molecular electric dipole moment are too small @xcite to affect our determination of the theoretical value of @xmath51 .",
    "it is possible that the experimental value of @xmath51 is affected by the pressure shift , which magnitude we presently do not know .",
    "further investigations can precise the frequency gap between the states ( 9,3 ) and ( 11,1 ) .",
    "the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath44 is rather small ( @xmath917% ) but well outside the statistical error .",
    "this difference may originate from our method of calculating @xmath92 in which we used the molecular structure ( bond lengths and angles ) averaged over ground state molecular vibration .",
    "more correct procedure would be to average an exact expression for @xmath44 over molecular vibration .",
    "this requires rather extensive calculations .",
    "there are a few contributions to the systematic error of value of @xmath93 .",
    "the response time of the setup used to measure the concentration of ortho molecules ( @xmath94  sec ) was not taken into account in the processing of the experimental data .",
    "this gives @xmath912% systematic decrease in the value of @xmath93 .",
    "another few percent of the systematic error may appear due to the procedure employed in @xcite to find out the conversion rate inside the stark cell .",
    "this procedure relies on the ratio of the stark cell volume to the volume outside the electric field .",
    "taking these circumstances into account we can estimate that up to @xmath9110% difference between the experimental and theoretical values of @xmath44 can be explained by the systematic errors . despite this difference",
    ", it is rather safe to conclude that our analysis has proven that the levels ( 9,3 ) and ( 11,1 ) are indeed mixed by the spin - spin interaction between the molecular nuclei .",
    "it is impressive that the level - crossing spectrum in the @xmath0ch@xmath1f isomer conversion has allowed to measure the hyperfine spin - spin coupling with the statistical error of 0.5 khz only .",
    "comparison between the measured spectrum and the model supports our choice for the @xmath46 being independent on @xmath37 and @xmath49 .",
    "independence of this parameter on @xmath37 is the direct consequence of the spatial isotropy of the media .",
    "the independence on @xmath95 is more intricate .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail elsewhere .    the value of @xmath48 obtained from the fitting procedure , @xmath96  s@xmath97/torr , appeared to be close to the level population decay rate @xmath98  s@xmath97/torr measured in ref .",

    "the factor 2 difference is not surprising .",
    "@xmath48 refers to the decay rate of the off - diagonal density matrix element @xmath99 between the states ( 11,1 ) and ( 9,3 ) which should be different from the population decay rate .",
    "in addition , the rotational quantum numbers in these two cases are different too .",
