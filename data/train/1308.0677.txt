    "the rotational dynamics of solar system bodies is fundamentally driven by its torque free motion , although the tiny influence of external torques like the gravity - gradient or the yorp effect may induce long - period or secular effects .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that these torques are generally small makes the computation of approximate analytical solutions possible using perturbation methods ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the torque free motion admits analytical , closed form solution , which is commonly taken as the zero order in the computation of approximate solutions of perturbed problems . in a hamiltonian framework ,",
    "this solution is obtained by finding the transformation from andoyer to action - angle variables @xcite , mainly because action - angle variables make achievable the essential checking of kam conditions in the completely reduced hamiltonian @xcite , and prevent the appearance of mixed secular - periodic terms in the solution of perturbed problems @xcite .",
    "then , the disturbing function is expressed as a trigonometric series in action - angle variables so that the perturbed hamiltonian can be simplified by the usual averaging of fast - evolving angles @xcite .",
    "the perturbation approach is quite feasible in the case of axisymmetric bodies , an instance in which andoyer variables are action - angle variables by themselves . in that case ,",
    "even the standard successive approximations method is suitable for finding the direct integration of the equations of motion by simple quadratures ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in the triaxial case , however , because of the elliptic integrals and functions on which the solution of the unperturbed problem rests , expanding the disturbing function as a trigonometric series may require a nontrivial preprocessing in which elliptic integrals and functions are conveniently expressed in terms of jacobi theta functions @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , some exceptions are found where the solution of the perturbed problem can be computed directly in elliptic functions , at least up to the first order , without need of resorting to series expansions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is customary to expand the solution of the torque free motion in terms of certain small quantity .",
    "thus , either in the ( physical ) case of rigid bodies with small triaxiality , or in the ( dynamical ) case of rotational motion close to a principal axis of inertia , early truncations of the series expansion of the unperturbed solution may result very efficient @xcite .",
    "specifically , the former applies to the rotation of the earth and other major bodies of the solar system , whose figure departs only slightly from the axisymmetrical case @xcite , whereas the latter may be the alternative for studying the rotation of some asteroids @xcite .",
    "it worths noting , however , that when the triaxiality of the rigid body is small , the part of the torque free rotation hamiltonian related to triaxiality can be taken as a perturbation of the axisymmetric case , and , consequently , can be included among the terms of the disturbing function ( see @xcite , for instance ) . when applying this strategy to the integrable problem of torque free rotation , the truncated expansions of kinoshita s analytical solution@xcite are recovered term for term @xcite .",
    "this alternative approach , taking an integrable problem as a perturbation of a simpler integrable problem , may be applied to further rearrange the torque free motion hamiltonian like a perturbed spherical rotor .",
    "such an ordering makes a perturbation approach by lie transforms very efficient in the case of almost spherical , almost axisymmetrical rigid bodies @xcite .",
    "the perturbation approach is not limited to the case of rigid bodies with small triaxiality and may be applied also to bodies with any triaxiality , either large or small , when the rotation happens close to the principal axis of maximum inertia , that is : rotating in the so - called short - axis - mode , or sam ( see appendix c of @xcite for a detailed classification of rotational modes ) .",
    "the demonstration of the feasibility of such perturbation approach is the goal of the present research .",
    "the first step in the procedure is to reorganize the torque free hamiltonian in such a way that the sine of the inclination angle between the body s equatorial plane and the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector is shown to scale the hamiltonian terms related to the non - sphericity of the rigid body . next , a trivial manipulation changes this general scaling into a perturbation scaling in which the magnitude of the small parameter is proportional to the sine of _ half _ that inclination angle .",
    "remarkably , the main part of the new perturbation arrangement , which is called here the main problem of sam rotation , is formally the same as the torque free rotation hamiltonian except for the halving of the inclination angle .",
    "but this subtle difference is enough to release the solution from its dependence on elliptic functions and integrals .",
    "it follows the standard hamilton - jacobi reduction @xcite to find the action - angle variables of the main problem of sam rotation , which is selected as the unperturbed problem .",
    "then , after formulating the perturbation part of the free rigid body hamiltonian in the new action - angle variables , the straightforward computation of a perturbation solution to the torque free motion by lie transforms @xcite is carried out up to any desired order .",
    "comparison of the lowest orders of the perturbation series solution with kinoshita s expansions of the closed form analytical solution of the free rigid body @xcite shows complete agreement between both independent solutions .",
    "finally , the known equivalence between short- and long - axis - mode ( lam ) when interchanging the moments of maximum and minimum inertia , trivially shows that the perturbation solution is useful also in the case of lam rotation with minor modifications in the definition of the inertia parameters .",
    "because of the preservation of the angular momentum vector @xmath0 , the plane perpendicular to it ( the so - called _ invariable _ plane ) plays an important role in finding the analytical solution of the torque free motion .",
    "thus , classical solutions using euler angles take this plane as the inertial plane to which the attitude of the rigid body is referred @xcite .",
    "referring the body frame to a different inertial plane is achieved by trivial rotations of fixed angles , say a new set of euler angles .",
    "this description of the attitude dynamics by means of two sets of euler angles makes it natural the introduction of the angles @xmath1 , between the @xmath2 axis of the inertial plane and the ascending node of the invariable plane on the inertial plane , @xmath3 , between this node and the ascending node of the equatorial plane of the body on the invariable plane , and @xmath4 , between the latter node and the @xmath2 axis of the body .",
    "their conjugate momenta are the modulus of the angular momentum vector @xmath5 , conjugate to @xmath3 , and the projections of @xmath0 over the @xmath6 axis of the inertial and body frames , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , conjugate to @xmath1 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the canonical set @xmath9 is what is customarily called andoyer variables @xcite , and so it is throughout this paper .",
    "the convenience of andoyer variables results evident when using hamiltonian formulation , because they disclose the integrable character of the torque free motion . due to the absence of external forces the hamiltonian of the torque free motion coincides with the kinetic energy of rotation about the center of mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is",
    "the angular velocity and @xmath12 is the inertia tensor .",
    "therefore , taking into account that @xmath13 and choosing the body frame as defined by the principal axes of inertia , it is easily found that @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the body s principal moments of inertia .",
    "equation ( [ andoyer ] ) shows that @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath16 are integrals of the problem due to the ignorable character of their respective conjugate variables . in consequence , the hamilton equations of eq .",
    "( [ andoyer ] ) decouple the reduced system in @xmath17 , of one degree of freedom , from the time evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is solved by quadrature after integrating the reduced system .",
    "therefore , the reduced phase space @xmath17 can be represented by simple contour plots of the hamiltonian , providing an alternative description to the poinsot ellipsoid representation @xcite .",
    "concerned with the rotation of the major bodies of the solar system , for which @xmath18 , andoyer@xcite introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 given by @xmath21 and reordered eq .",
    "( [ andoyer ] ) as a perturbation problem @xmath22.\\ ] ]    both andoyer s parameters have a clear physical meaning as is apparent in eq .",
    "( [ alfabeta ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath23 implies @xmath24 , the oblate case , whereas @xmath25 results from @xmath26 , the prolate one , both extremes corresponding to axisymmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 shows how much the body s figure departs from the axisymmetrical case , and hence is usual called the triaxiality coefficient . on the other side",
    ", @xmath28 corresponds to a spherical rotor @xmath29 and , therefore , this coefficient indicates how much the body departs from the spherical figure .",
    "is noted @xmath30 by kinoshita @xcite who , in addition , instead of @xmath31 uses the inertia parameter @xmath32 first proposed by hitzl and breakwell @xcite . ]",
    "andoyer s arrangement of the free rigid body hamiltonian is quite convenient when studying the rotation of the major bodies of the solar system under external torques , a case in which both @xmath31 and @xmath27 are small quantities . besides , this is the natural ordering in a perturbed spherical rotor approach , in which both the non sphericity and the triaxiality are taken as perturbations , and that proved very efficient when approaching the perturbed rotation of almost spherical bodies by lie transforms @xcite .",
    "however , neither @xmath31 nor @xmath27 have to be small , in general , and hence the general solution of the torque free motion must be taken as the zero order in the perturbation approach , a fact that complicates the development of the disturbing function because of the elliptic integrals and functions on which the solution of the free rigid body rotation unavoidably depends .",
    "nevertheless , using the general solution to the torque free motion can be avoided in other specific cases , where perturbation strategies can be set up .",
    "that is the case of rotations close to the principal axis of maximum inertia , a case in which @xmath33 .",
    "then , the inclination angle @xmath34 between the equatorial plane of the rigid body and the invariable plane is small , and so it is @xmath35 in eq .",

    "<S> a simple rearrangement of the torque free motion hamiltonian shapes it as a perturbation problem for bodies rotating close to the principal axis of maximum inertia , independently of their triaxiality . </S>",
    "<S> the complete reduction of the main part of this hamiltonian via the hamilton - jacobi equation provides the action - angle variables that ease the construction of a perturbation solution by lie transforms . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest orders of the transformation equations of the perturbation solution are checked to agree with kinoshita s corresponding expansions for the exact solution of the free rigid body problem . for approximately axisymmetric bodies rotating close to the principal axis of maximum inertia , the common case of major solar system bodies , </S>",
    "<S> the new approach is advantageous over classical expansions based on a small triaxiality parameter . </S>"
