    "two - particle intensity interferometry , exploiting bose - einstein correlations between pairs of identical bosons ( pions , kaons ) , has been extensively used to extract information about the space - time structure of high - energy hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "three - particle bose - einstein correlations were shown to yield additional information which can not be extracted from two - particle correlations @xcite : ( i ) after subtracting the two - particle correlation contributions and extrapolating to zero relative momentum , the strength of the genuine three - particle correlation term relative to the two - particle correlator provides an unambiguous measure for the degree of chaoticity of the source ( or , conversely , it limits the degree of phase - coherence in the particle emission process ) @xcite .",
    "this idea has recently been applied by the star collaboration @xcite to three - pion correlations from 130@xmath0gev au+au collisions at rhic , showing that at these collision energies the data are consistent with a completely incoherent ( `` chaotic '' ) pion emission process .",
    "( ii ) for a completely chaotic source , the full momentum dependence of the `` reduced '' three - pion correlator @xmath1 can be used to extract spatial asymmetries of the source around its point of maximum emissivity @xcite ; for a partially coherent source , the momentum dependence of @xmath2 constrains the relative spatial sizes of the coherent and incoherent parts of the emission function @xcite .",
    "this information is , however , difficult to extract because the required accurate analysis of its full momentum dependence puts statistical demands on the measured three - pion correlator which can not be met by presently available data .",
    "statistical limitations therefore so far force experimentalists to project the three - pion correlation function onto a single relative momentum variable .",
    "the preferred choice @xcite for this variable is a lorentz scalar that is completely symmetric under interchange of the three pions : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the lorentz - invariant relative momenta between pairs in the pion triplet .",
    "this projection has undesirable , but to some extent unavoidable consequences for the relative momentum dependence of the three - pion correlator .",
    "specifically , it is known @xcite that for a completely chaotic source the leading relative momentum dependence of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the average momentum of the triplet while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two linearly independent relative momenta ) at small @xmath9 is of @xmath10 order in the components of the relative momenta @xmath11 .",
    "the projection on @xmath12 instead introduces a dominant quadratic @xmath13-dependence which buries the coefficients of the @xmath10- and higher - order contributions that would allow to extract additional interesting source information , such as the momentum dependence of the point of maximum emissivity and the asymmetry of the source around that point @xcite .    in this short note",
    "we investigate in some detail the effects of this projection procedure .",
    "we show that there are different possibilities to project onto a single variable @xmath12 some of which exacerbate the above problem far beyond the unavoidable minimum .",
    "in particular , the version employed so far in the data analysis has the undesirable feature of introducing a relative momentum dependence in the projected three - pion correlator _ even for a static gaussian source for which the underlying unprojected correlator is completely momentum - independent_. we therefore suggest a different projection method which avoids this undesirable feature and furthermore allows for a `` staged projection '' onto any subset or different combination of the three particle momenta . as a side effect , the new method also facilitates the comparison of the projected three - pion correlator with theoretical models .",
    "the two- and three - particle correlation functions are defined as the ratios between the two- and three - particle coincidence cross sections and the products of independent single - particle cross sections : & & c_2(12 ) c_2(_1,_2 ) = , + & & c_3(123 ) c_3(_1,_2,_3 ) = , where n_1(_i ) & = & ( i=1,2,3 ) , + n_2(_1,_2 ) & = & , + n_3(_1,_2,_3 ) & = & .",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) are frame - independent even though they do nt look that way since the energy factors @xmath14 making the cross sections @xmath15 etc .",
    "lorentz invariant cancel between numerators and denominators . in the absence of correlations @xmath16 .",
    "one defines the `` true @xmath17-particle correlators '' @xmath18 ( cumulants ) by subtracting uncorrelated parts and correlations involving fewer than @xmath17 particles : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the `` normalized true three - particle correlator '' @xmath21 @xcite is obtained by dividing @xmath22 by the square root of the product of 2-particle correlators :    r_3(123 ) = .    for a fully chaotic source ,",
    "@xmath2 approaches the value 2 at zero relative momenta , @xmath23 , for any value of the triplet momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the leading deviations from this limit in both numerator and denominator are of second order in the components of @xmath11 , but these leading corrections cancel in the ratio , leaving a leading @xmath10 order term in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that a projection of the numerator and denominator onto a smaller number of momentum components will in general destroy the cancellation of the leading @xmath24 order terms , thus generating an artificial leading quadratic @xmath11-dependence of the projected @xmath2 .",
    "this leading quadratic @xmath13-dependence is not interesting because its coefficients depend on properties of the source which can already be extracted from the two - particle correlation function .",
    "unfortunately , this extraction is not completely model - independent @xcite , so it is not clear whether , even in principle , it might be possible to subtract the unwanted second order terms , using the measured two - particle correlators , in order to uncover the subleading @xmath10 order terms in the projected @xmath2 .",
    "we will not address this issue here .",
    "instead we will focus on a different question : _ is it possible to minimize these projection artefacts by using an optimized projection algorithm ? _",
    "in @xcite the star collaboration constructed a projected version @xmath25 of the normalized true three - pion correlator using the following procedure : first , they constructed projected two- and three - particle correlation functions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , by taking pairs and triplets of pions from the same collision event , summed over all events , binning them in the lorentz - invariant variables @xmath28 and @xmath12 , respectively , and dividing the contents of each bin by that of an equivalent bin at the same @xmath29-value which was filled with uncorrelated pairs or triplets generated from mixed events @xcite .",
    "this procedure can be formally represented by the following definitions :     [ 5 ] |c_3(q_3 ) & = & . from these projected correlation functions",
    "one then constructs the ratio ( [ 3 ] ) by fixing @xmath12 and summing over all two - particle relative momenta @xmath28 whose squares add up to @xmath30 .",
    "formally & & |r_3(q_3 ) = ^-1 + & & _ 0^dq_12 dq_23 dq_31 ( q_3- ) .",
    "note that the four terms in the numerator of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) involve four different @xmath31-functions .",
    "this is clearly inconvenient when comparing to theoretical model calculations ( for example those by nakamura and seki @xcite ) which are not easily projected in the same way .",
    "more seriously , however , the mixing of different projection algorithms for @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) upsets the above - mentioned partial cancellation of the relative momentum dependences in the numerator and denominator of the integrand .",
    "it thereby acerbates the problem of introducing unwanted @xmath13-dependence into @xmath2 by projecting it .",
    "we demonstrate this by considering a very simple , spherically symmetric source characterized by the following ( unnormalized ) emission function : s(x , p ) = e_p ( t - t_0)e^-^2/2r^2 e^-^2/2 ^ 2 .",
    "particles are emitted instantaneously at global time @xmath34 , with a gaussian momentum distribution which is independent of the emission point ( no `` @xmath35-@xmath36-correlations '' ) .",
    "the factor @xmath37 is introduced for calculational convenience so that it drops out from relations such as @xmath38 which relate the @xmath17-particle spectra @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) to the emission function @xmath40 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we assume nonrelativistic momenta , @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath63 is plotted in figure  [ f1 ] as a function of @xmath62 in the relevant range @xmath64 where the two- and three - particle correlation functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 show measurable deviations from unity @xcite .",

    "the continued cancellation of 2@xmath67 order terms is probably accidental and due to the particularly simple structure of the emission function ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in front of the @xmath68 term is small , and the deviations of @xmath63 from 2 become significant only at @xmath69 .",
    "this may explain why humanic did not see such a deviation in his monte carlo model study @xcite which explored @xmath63 in a restricted @xmath12 range and with limited statistical accuracy , even though he employed the same projection procedure ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence in eq .",

    "the numerator contains sums and differences of different kinds of triplet yields : the first term denotes real triplets where all three pions come from the same collision event , the last term mixed event triplets where all three pions come from different events , and the middle three terms subtract mixed - event triplets where two pions come from the same and the third from a different collision . for consistency with eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , the distributions of both types of mixed - event triplets must be normalized such that they agree with the real triplets at large relative momenta where all quantum statistical correlations disappear : eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) shows that for @xmath71 , @xmath72 vanishes in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "the denominator in ( [ 18 ] ) involves a product of differences between yields of real pairs and mixed - event pairs ( again normalized to the same total number of pairs ) , with pion momenta as indicated by the arguments .",
    "it can be rewritten as the yield of mixed - event triplets multiplied by a weight factor , [ den(_1,_2,_3 ) ] = n_1(_1)n_1(_2)n_1(_3 ) ( _ 1,_2,_3 ) , where the latter is computed from the ( coulomb corrected ) two - particle correlation function @xmath74 according to ( _ 1,_2,_3 ) = .",
    "fully six - dimensional analyses of the two - particle correlation function @xmath75 are available",
    ". it can be tabulated and interpolated , allowing for a straightforward calculation of the weight @xmath76 .",
    "( again the mixed - pair background must be normalized such that @xmath77 . )",
    "we propose to construct @xmath2 directly from the ratio ( [ 18 ] ) instead of first constructing two- and three - particle correlation functions and then using ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to project eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) onto the single relative momentum variable @xmath12 ( or onto any other desired combination of the three pion momenta ) by binning the numerator and denominator separately in @xmath12 and taking the ratio : r_3(q_3 ) = .",
    "note that , by symmetry , the three middle terms in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) give identical contributions to eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "the numerator is thus obtained by first running separately through all real triplets , all triplets with two particles from the same event and the third particle from a different event , and all mixed - event triplets , binning each of these in @xmath12 . after normalizing the bin contents of the mixed - event triplets by the appropriate factor which ensures that their distributions agree with that of the real triplets at large @xmath78 ( note that this does _ not _ imply that they necessarily agree at large @xmath12 ! ) , one then subtracts , for each value of @xmath12 , from the bin containing the real triplets three times the bin content from the half - mixed triplets and adds twice the content from the fully mixed triplets . for the denominator one runs over all fully mixed triplets ,",
    "calculates for each of them the weight @xmath79 and bins these weights in @xmath12 . at the end one",
    "normalizes the bin contents by the same factor as for the fully mixed triplets in the numerator .",
    "while this projection procedure does not , of course , completely sidestep the unavoidable interference with the cancellation of the leading relative momentum dependences between numerator and denominator , at least it preserves the _ momentum - independence _ of @xmath2 in the `` trivial '' case ( [ 7 ] ) of a spherically symmetric , static source without @xmath35-@xmath36-correlations : for the source ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath80 .",
    "a technical complication for the data analysis arises from the repulsive final state coulomb interaction between the emitted charged pions which must be corrected for before computing the reduced three - pion correlator @xmath2 .",
    "this problem poses itself similarly for both projection techniques and can be dealt with in the same way in either approach , by using coulomb correction factors extracted from a self - consistent coulomb correction of the two - pion correlation functions .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "note that in the form given in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) , the coulomb correction must be applied to the _ real _  pairs and triplets , and not to the mixed - event ones .",
    "we have shown that , for a simple spherically symmetric , non - expanding source with sudden particle emission , the standard projection procedure , as up to now applied in the experimental analysis of three - pion correlations , introduces an artificial momentum dependence into the normalized true three - pion correlator @xmath2 , even though the exact result for @xmath2 is completely momentum - independent .",
    "this suggests that the observed @xmath12 dependence of @xmath63 seen by wa98 in pb+pb collisions at the sps @xcite and by star in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite may be significantly affected by artificial projection effects .",
    "even though projection - induced relative momentum dependence of @xmath2 can in general not be completely avoided , it can be minimized by using the new projection procedure suggested in this paper .",
    "this procedure computes @xmath2 in a more direct way and applies the same binning to all terms .",
    "it preserves the momentum - independence of @xmath2 for a symmetric non - expanding source .",
    "the new projection algorithm can also be easily employed in theoretical model calculations , rendering the comparison with data ( but not necessarily the interpretation of the extracted source parameters ) more straightforward .",
