    "although the classical correlation and , consequently , the quantum discord ( [ def : quantum correlation ] ) is extremely difficult to compute in terms of von neumann entropy , the classical correlation ( [ linear - entropy - cc ] ) expressed in terms of linear entropy can be calculated analytically . in what follows",

    "( [ t1 ] ) gives the analytical formula for the classical correlation in terms of linear entropy for a general @xmath0 quantum state .",
    "indeed , one only needs to find the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath64 .    since ,",
    "for a given state @xmath4 , the reduced state @xmath40 , @xmath39 and the map @xmath44 are fixed , the classical correlation can readily be computed in terms of linear entropy @xmath65 .",
    "what concern us here are the optimal measurements that give rise to @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondence between all possible povm measurements and all convex decompositions of @xmath66 @xcite ; namely , if @xmath67 is the pure state decomposition of @xmath66 , then the following are the corresponding povms : @xmath68 m_1=(\\rho^b)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}p_1 |\\psi_{1}\\ra\\la \\psi_{1}| ( \\rho^b)^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is full - ranked .",
    "otherwise , we can find the inverse of @xmath40 in its range projection and , from the optimal pure state decompositions of @xmath66 , we can get the corresponding optimal povms . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have shown how to find the optimal decomposition of @xmath66 .",
    "first write @xmath66 in its bloch form : @xmath69 .",

    "there are exactly two solutions of the equation @xmath75 .",
    "hence the optimal decomposition of @xmath66 reads : @xmath67 . from the two pure states in the optimal decomposition",
    ", we obtain the two optimal povm measurement operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is well known that to maximize the classical correlation it is necessary to use the most general povm quantum measurement . as it is much more complicated to find the maximum in ( [ def : classical correlation ] ) over all povms than over von neumann measurements , almost all known analytical results are based on the latter . indeed , only very few results are based on povm @xcite .",
    "here , we show that for the case of a bipartite qudit - qubit state , the classical correlation based on linear entropy is maximized over projective measurements ( see proof in the appendix ) .",
    "this leads to our first theorem :    * theorem 1 . *",
    "the classical correlation of a qudit - qubit state @xmath83 defined by running over all ( arbitrary ) povm measurements is the same as the classical correlation defined by running over all projective measurements , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "theorem 1 implies that the optimal povm in the classical correlation defined by eq .",
    "( [ linear - entropy - cc ] ) is in fact a projective measurement .",
    "this is very different from the case of classical correlation @xmath85 defined by von neumann entropy , in which the classical correlation based on povm could be larger than the one based on projective measurement @xcite .",
    "this shows that , although von neumann entropy and linear entropy have many properties in common , they behave quite differently in optimizing classical information .",
    "however , by using the optimal projective measurement for the classical correlation @xmath61 based on linear entropy , we can get a tight lower bound for the classical correlation based on von neumann entropy , and hence a tight upper bound for the quantum discord based on von neumann entropy .",
    "this leads us to our second theorem :    * theorem 2 . *",

    "in fact , there is a connection between discord and entanglement of formation ( eof ) : the classical correlation @xmath85 can be obtained from eof by the koashi winter relation @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath85 is the original classical correlation of @xmath92 state @xmath4 , @xmath93 is the eof of state @xmath94 , and @xmath94 is the purification of @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that , from theorem 2 , we can get an upper bound of eof for arbitrary rank two @xmath95 state @xmath94 .",
    "although the upper bound ( [ lb ] ) of @xmath96 is given by the optimal measurement of @xmath65 , we show , by means of examples , that it is a surprisingly good estimate of @xmath96 .",
