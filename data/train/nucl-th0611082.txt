    "<S> more precisely , we study the contributions to the @xmath0-hyperon optical potential due to the long - range two - pion exchange , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons in the internal baryonic lines and considering nh and @xmath3h excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the contribution to the spin - orbit potentials that comes out from these terms . </S>",
