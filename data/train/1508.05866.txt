    "kelvin probe force microscopy ( kpfm ) , a variant of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has become one of the indispensable tools used to investigate electronic properties of nanoscale material as well as nanoscale devices . in kpfm ,",
    "a surface potential of a sample is measured by detecting a capacitive electrostatic force that is a function of the surface potential and applied bias voltage . in order to separate the electrostatic force component from other force components such as van der waals force , chemical bonding force and magnetic force , the electrostatic force is modulated by applying an ac bias voltage and the resulting modulated component of the measured force",
    "is detected by lock - in detection @xcite .",
    "kpfm has been implemented in a variety of ways that can be classified into two distinct categories , amplitude modulation ( am ) @xcite and frequency modulation ( fm ) @xcite .",
    "the former implementation takes advantage of enhanced electrostatic force detection sensitivity by tuning the modulation frequency to one of the resonance frequencies of the afm cantilever , leading to an enhanced detection of the electrostatic force by its quality ( @xmath1- ) factor that can reach over 10,000 in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the latter method ( fm - kpfm ) detects the modulation in the resonance frequency shift that is induced by a low frequency ac voltage . while this method requires a much higher ac voltage amplitude , it offers higher spatial resolution because the resonance frequency shift is determined by the electrostatic force gradient with respect to the tip - sample distance rather than the force itself @xcite .",
    "here we report a new kpfm implementation ( d - kpfm ) using the dissipation signal of conventional fm - afm systems to detect the electrostatic force .",
    "the dissipation arises from an oscillating electrostatic force acting on the afm tip that is coherent with the tip oscillation ( trajectory ) .",
    "the oscillating electrostatic force is induced by applying an ac voltage between the tip and sample . by setting the phase of the ac voltage to @xmath2 out of phase with respect to the tip oscillation",
    ", an electrically induced dissipation can result without affecting the resonance frequency shift , allowing topography imaging to be performed in constant frequency shift mode .",
    "the kpfm feedback loop can be implemented with the electrically induced dissipation signal as it is proportional to the effective dc potential difference between the tip and sample , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are an applied dc voltage and the contact potential difference , respectively .",
    "this new technique makes it possible to take full advantage of the enhanced force sensitivity by the high @xmath1-factor fundamental resonance mode as there is no need to excite higher flexural modes for the electrostatic force detection . in conventional am - kpfm @xcite , because the fundamental mode is used for topography imaging , the frequency of ac bias voltage is typically configured to excite a higher resonance mode ( typically second flexural mode ) that have much higher effective spring constant , cancelling the high @xmath1-factor resonance enhancement .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of the technique presented here allows the use of a much smaller ac voltage enabling less invasive potential measurements , which is of great importance in the electrical characterizations of technically relevant materials whose electrical properties are influenced by the externally applied electric field as is the case in semiconductor electronic devices .",
    "although a similar technique has already been reported by fukuma _",
    "@xcite , it has not been adopted widely probably because of complexity in its implementation .",
    "the present technique is simpler in implementation and even requires no additional lock - in amplifier as there is no low - frequency modulation involved .",
    "the electrostatic force between two conductors connected to an ac and dc voltage source , @xmath6 , is described as follows @xcite : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the tip - sample capacitance , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the applied dc voltage and the contact potential difference , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the amplitude , angular frequency and phase of the ac bias voltage .",
    "@xmath13 is the position of the tip with respect to the sample surface and the oscillating tip around its mean position , @xmath14 , expressed as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being its oscillation angular frequency and amplitude , respectively .",
    "we assume that the tip oscillation is driven by another means such as piezoacoustic or photothermal excitation and its frequency , @xmath18 , is chosen to be that of the fundamental flexural resonance mode , @xmath19 .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "[ eq : felec ] and isolating each harmonic component , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which result from the applied ac bias voltage , yields the following terms : @xmath23    notice that the @xmath13-dependence of @xmath24 must be taken into account in order to correctly describe the response of the oscillating cantilever subject to the oscillating electrostatic force induced by the coherent ac voltage .    by expanding @xmath25 around the mean position , @xmath14 , and taking the first order term ,",
    "@xmath25 is expressed as follows :    @xmath26    substituting eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] into eq .",
    "[ f0 ] and rearranging it yields , @xmath27    note that the second term expresses an oscillating force whose frequency is @xmath28 while the first term expresses the static deflection of the cantilever . as this oscillating force is in phase with respect to @xmath29",
    ", it results in a shift in resonance frequency @xcite .    substituting eq .",

    "[ eq : f1 ] , which are detected in the conventional fm - kpfm @xcite .",
    "we focus on a special case where @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 can be simplified as follows : @xmath34 we notice that the interaction between the mechanical oscillation of the tip and the oscillating electrostatic force produce a static force and two harmonic forces with frequency , @xmath16 and @xmath35 .",
    "likewise @xmath36 ( eq .  [ f2 ] ) contains three harmonic terms with their frequency , @xmath16 , @xmath35 and @xmath37 under the same condition ( @xmath38 ) as follows : @xmath39    as is shown in the theory of fm - afm @xcite , the resonance frequency shift and dissipation signal are essentially determined by the in - phase and quadrature component of the fundamental harmonic component ( in this case @xmath16 ) of the oscillating force , respectively .",
    "putting together all the @xmath16 components from @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and rearranging them , we get the following expression :    @xmath40    where @xmath41{v_\\mathrm{ac}}^2   \\label{eq : fin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath42    these @xmath43 and @xmath44 cause the resonance frequency shift and dissipation signal in fm - afm , respectively . as can be seen in the formula for @xmath43 , the frequency shift versus @xmath45 curve will be a parabola whose minimum is shifted from @xmath5 by the value determined by the phase , @xmath12 , and amplitude , @xmath10 , of the oscillating bias voltage .",
    "this indicates that the bias voltage at the parabola minimum is no longer @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the special case where @xmath46 , we find @xmath47    the resulting resonance frequency shift , @xmath48 and the dissipation signal , @xmath49 , are obtained using the formulas found in ref .   as follows :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the effective spring constant of the fundamental flexural mode of the cantilever and @xmath52 is the dissipation without the ac bias voltage which is given by the mechanical @xmath1 factor of the cantilever . in the case",
    "where the applied bias , @xmath4 , is equal to the contact potential difference , @xmath5 , the dissipation goes back to its original value , @xmath52 .",
    "it is therefore possible to use the dissipation signal , @xmath49 , as the kpfm bias voltage feedback signal with @xmath52 as its control setpoint value .",

    ", the d - kpfm technique requires only two additional components , a phase shifter and proportional - integrator ( pi ) controller compared to normal fm - afm systems .",
    "the oscillation of the afm cantilever was controlled by a self - oscillation feedback loop electronics which consists of a phase shifter and an amplitude controller .",
    "the amplitude controller is used to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude and composed of a root - mean - square ( rms ) amplitude detector and a pi controller ( nanosurf easypllplus oscillator controller ) .",
    "the output of the amplitude feedback pi controller is the dissipation signal which will be used for controlling the dc bias voltage .",
    "the detection bandwidth of the rms amplitude detector was extended to about 10  khz by replacing the integration capacitor in the original rms detector circuit .",
    "the deflection signal is fed into the additional phase shifter , which serves to adjust the relative phase , @xmath12 , to produce the ac voltage which is @xmath2 out of phase to the cantilever deflection . due to the phase delay in the deflection sensing electronics ,",
    "the actual phase shift value set by the phase shifter may be different from @xmath2 .",
    "the dissipation signal acts as the input signal to the pi controller , which adjusts the applied dc bias , @xmath4 , to maintain a constant dissipation equal to the value without @xmath10 applied , @xmath52 .",

    "the height of the ridge is approximately 20  nm with respect to the etched regions .",
    "a clear fractal - like pattern can be seen on the ridge in both potential images .",
    "the potential contrast can be ascribed to the residue of the etch resist ( pmma ) as the topography images show the similar contrast whose thickness is about 1  nm .",

    "the similar difference has been observed in the potential contrast taken with fm - kpfm and am - kpfm and is ascribed to the fact that the am - kpfm is sensitive to electrostatic force whereas fm - kpfm uses the modulation in the resonance frequency shift which is sensitive to force gradient @xcite .",
    "the similarity between d - kpfm and am - kpfm is apparent in the expression of @xmath49 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : g ] ) which is proportional to @xmath68 rather than @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that the smaller potential variation observed in d - kpfm resulted from larger spatial average due to the stray capacitance including the body of the tip and the cantilever @xcite .     on sio@xmath60/si substrate by ( a ) d - kpfm ( @xmath70  hz , @xmath71  nm@xmath57 , @xmath62  mv@xmath57 ) and ( b ) fm - kpfm techniques ( @xmath70  hz , @xmath71  nm@xmath57 , @xmath63  v@xmath57 , @xmath72  hz ) .",
    "[ fig : dkpfm_image],width=332 ]    in spite of lower contrast , d - kpfm has a clear advantage that it requires much smaller @xmath73mv@xmath57 compared with 1  v@xmath57 for fm - kpfm , in this case .",
    "this advantage is important for such samples as semiconductor where the influence of the large @xmath10 can be very important due to band - bending effects .",
    "the detection bandwidth of d - kpfm is determined by the bandwidth of the amplitude control feedback loop used in fm - kpfm .",
    "in fact , applying the coherent @xmath10 causing dissipative force can be used to measure the dynamics of the amplitude control feedback system . in fm - kpfm",
    ", the afm cantilever serves for the frequency determining element of an oscillator circuit ( i.e.self-oscillator ) so that the oscillation frequency of the oscillator keeps track of the resonance frequency of the cantilever . in this way",
    ", the conservative force has no influence on the drive amplitude @xcite and the amplitude controller compensates for the effective @xmath1 factor change caused by dissipative force .",
    "therefore , by modulating @xmath4 at a low frequency ( < a few khz ) together with applying the coherent @xmath10 , the amplitude of the dissipative force can be modulated as can been seen in eq .",
    "[ eq : fout90 ] and the frequency response of the amplitude feedback loop can thus be measured with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the measured @xmath74  db bandwidth of the amplitude feedback loop is as high as 1  khz , which is wider than that of the pll frequency detector ( 400  hz ) .",
    "note that in contrast to the settling time of the oscillation amplitude of a cantilever subject to a change in conservative force which is @xmath75 @xcite , the response time to a dissipative force is not limited by @xmath1 and can be faster as the energy dissipated per cycle is given by @xmath76 rather than @xmath77 for the case of conservative force .",
    "this explains the observed fast response of the amplitude feedback loop , resulting in the wider bandwidth of the voltage feedback loop in d - kpfm than that in fm - kpfm that is limited by pll demodulation bandwidth ( typically @xmath78  khz ) which sets the bias modulation frequency .",
    "the noise of @xmath5 is ultimately determined by the noise in the tip oscillation amplitude , @xmath79 .",
    "the change in the oscillation amplitude of the self - excited cantilever , @xmath80 , caused by the dissipative force , @xmath44 , is given by @xmath81    eq .",
    "[ eq : amp_dep ] resembles the amplitude response of a simple harmonic oscillator driven on resonance on which am - kpfm is based .",
    "the noise in @xmath5 , @xmath82 can thus be expressed as follows : @xmath83 which agrees with the result by fukuma _",
    "this indicates that @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "in typical am - kpfm measurements @xcite where the second flexural mode oscillation is used for detecting electrostatic force , the improvement of @xmath82 by the enhanced @xmath1 factor is partially cancelled by the substantially higher dynamic spring constant of the second mode with @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "d - kpfm enables to fully take advantage of the resonance enhancement while retaining the advantages of the single - pass fm - afm .",
    "so far we assumed that no other process other than the dissipative electrostatic force causes the dissipation signal in fm - afm systems .",
    "although it is often the case that the contribution from other processes are negligible , even when other intrinsic or extrinsic dissipation processes are present , it is possible to separate the dissipation induced by @xmath44 just as is done in fm - kpfm with @xmath48 or in the method by fukuma _",
    "_ @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath4 needs to be modulated at a low frequency and the resulting modulated dissipation signal is used for the dc bias feedback .",
    "clearly this scheme is slower than the fast response achieved by d - kpfm technique .    in conclusion ,",
    "we report a new experimental technique for kelvin probe force microscopy using the dissipation signal of fm - afm for dc voltage feedback .",
    "it features the simpler implementation and faster scanning as it requires no low frequency modulation .",
    "the dissipation is caused by the oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip oscillation , which is induced by a sinusoidally oscillating ac voltage applied between the tip and sample .",
    "we analyzed the effect of the phase of the oscillating force on the frequency shift and dissipation and found that the relative phase of 90@xmath0 is the most appropriate for kpfm measurements .",
    "d - kpfm technique requires a significantly smaller ac voltage amplitude ( a few tens of mv ) by virtue of the resonance enhanced force detection and the use of fundamental flexural mode oscillation",
