    "the setup we have in mind consists of two dqd s alongside a qpc , _ cf . _",
    "[ pmeter ] * ( a)*. we will show that a capacitance model based only on _ linear _ relations between charge and potentials explains the existence of the desired _ quadratic _ coupling ( [ quadc ] ) in our device . while in ref .",
    "the quadratic measurement is achieved by considering an inflection point of the transmission with @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the transmission amplitude and @xmath5 the potential of the measurement device , the quadratic coupling which we discuss below is realized for arbitrary transmission since it is a consequence of the spatial symmetry of our arrangement .",
    "a similar idea , using geometric symmetry ( in a more complicated interferometric structure ) to realize a quadratic detector has been proposed in ref .  .",
    "we assume that each dqd contains a single electron , which therefore acts as a charge qubit , and can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 here @xmath2 ( for the two different qubits ) , @xmath7 is the difference of single particle energy levels in each dot , @xmath8 is the tunnel coupling between the dots , and @xmath9 is a pauli matrix acting on qubit @xmath10 . the direct electrostatic coupling between the two dqd s is neglected .",

    "the coupling hamiltonian may be expressed in the basis , defined with each of the configurations @xmath22 , where we assign pseudo - spins to the position of the electron in the dqd : spin @xmath23 corresponds to the case where the electron is in the upper dot and spin @xmath24 corresponds to the case where the electron is in the lower dot .",
    "the even parity class contains the states @xmath25",
    ". we will show below that the parity detector can distinguish only between the even and the odd parity classes .",
    "this defines the basis that is accessible to the parity detector .",
    "the parity detector can not distinguish the states in either even or odd subclass , but it can distinguish between parity subclasses .",
    "in particular , the energy of both even configurations are equal , and the energies of both odd configurations are equal , but the even energy is not equal to the odd energy",

    "we will now demonstrate that a single qpc placed in a special way between two dqd s has a hamiltonian of the form ( [ hint ] ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pmeter ] * ( b ) * , we divide the two dqd s as well as the qpc in two regions with two corresponding charges each .",

    "the saddle point potentials allow us to determine the transmission coefficient of the qpc .    as compared to the odd parity class",
    ", the even class will polarize the qpc , i.e. there will be an additional electrical field @xmath14 at the saddle point with a potential @xmath45 , which will give rise to a shift in the location of the saddle point and an increase in its height @xmath46 to estimate the field @xmath14 we consider the capacitive model shown in fig .",
    "[ pmeter ] * ( b)*. the qpc dipole is described with a capacitance @xmath47 and the dipole charges @xmath48 and @xmath49 exist in regions with potentials @xmath50 and @xmath51 . @xcite a charge on a dot next to a dipole region has a capacitance @xmath52 and the interaction of the charges across a dqd is described by an ( internal ) capacitance @xmath53 . for simplicity , we assume that only nearest neighbor charge configurations couple to each other .",
    "this is justified because the qpc screens the dqd s , and , therefore , decreases the direct coupling between the dqd s substantially .",
    "we now have for the dqd charges the equations @xmath54 and for the qpc dipole charges @xmath55 these become a complete set of equations if we assume that the region over which the dipole extends has a density of states @xmath56 such that a small variation of the potential in these regions gives rise to a charge @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 . here",
    "we have assumed that the qpc potential is spatially symmetric in the odd parity configuration .",
    "this requires that the qpc is located symmetrically in between the dqd s and permits us to take the density of states to the right and the left of the qpc to be equal to @xmath60 .",
    "we obtain for the coulomb energy @xmath61 where @xmath62 we see that there exist a contribution to the coulomb energy proportional to @xmath63 given by @xmath64 this contribution affects the saddle point potential in such a way that the qpc acts as a parity meter .",
    "( [ ec ] ) can be identified with eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) .",
    "we now estimate the saddle point potential , in the even configuration , which determines the transmission .",
    "the voltage drop of the dipole is @xmath65 and , assuming that the center of its charges is separated by a distance @xmath66 , we find an electric field @xmath67 .",
    "hence , using eqs .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ u ] ) we obtain @xmath68 thus , the qpc has a saddle point height @xmath43 for the odd configuration [ @xmath69 and a somewhat higher saddle point potential @xmath44 for the even configuration [ @xmath70 .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ dipol ] the symmetric potential landscape of the qpc in the odd case and the generated dipole across the qpc in the even case as well as the corresponding saddle point potentials .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath71 of the qpc is directly related to the saddle point height via @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fermi energy in the qpc , @xmath74 for the odd case , and @xmath75 for the even case .",
    "this shows that the transmission probability through the system considered here has indeed the desired property stated in eq .",
    "( [ quadc ] ) .",
    "to summarize , there are three physically distinguishable situations : ( i ) there is no charge dipole ( both odd configurations ) , ( ii ) there is a qpc charge dipole pointing up ( the even configuration @xmath76 ) , and ( iii ) there is a qpc charge dipole pointing down ( the even configuration @xmath77 ) .",
    "although all three situations are distinguishable in principle , the crucial fact is that the potential height experienced by the transport electrons is the same in both even configurations .",
    "therefore , the current differs only between the even and the odd configuration . for later reference ,",
    "we define here the two currents @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the bias voltage across the qpc and we have re - introduced @xmath80 and @xmath81 for clarity . during the measurement , the qpc should be operated in the regime of linear @xmath79 but still @xmath82 .",
    "the reason is that a large bias would break the symmetry between the @xmath83 and the @xmath84 state , so the parity meter could then distinguish the two states of the even class . in typical systems",
    "( for instance the ones investigated in ref .  ) , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and the @xmath87-@xmath88 characteristics of the qpc is linear .",
    "thus , the above stated requirements can be easily met .",
    "the parity measurement time @xcite @xmath89 with @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is the time scale required to a obtain a signal - to - noise ratio of order 1 .",
    "in current ( present day ) gaas - based quantum dot devices this time scale will be of the order of a few @xmath92 ( see e.g. ref .  ) and therefore much longer than typical coherence times of the order of a few @xmath93 .",
    "for quantum dots in other physical systems such as carbon nanotubes or nanowires the coherence times should be much longer and therefore the measurement time @xmath94 can , in principle , become of the same order as the coherence time or even smaller .    for the bell measurement ( discussed below ) , it is important that the coupling between the two qubits ( the two dqd s ) can be turned off after the state has been prepared . in our setup , the coupling between the two dqd s is minimized by removing the bias voltage ( @xmath95 ) and by pinching off the qpc , therefore , reducing @xmath96 .",
    "for all operations that are done on a time scale @xmath97 , the density matrix of the two dqd s experiences little coherent evolution due to the coupling term ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "therefore , on such short time scales the two qubits would behave as if they were decoupled .",
    "at the symmetry point of the two - qubit system , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , our device acts as an entangler just by measuring the current through the qpc .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two qubits at the symmetry point ( index sp ) reads @xmath100 the eigenstates of @xmath101 are the two anti - symmetric bell states @xmath102 the state @xmath103 belongs to the odd parity class and the state @xmath104 to the even one .",
    "thus , both eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath101 can be distinguished from each other by a current measurement through the qpc in fig .",
    "[ pmeter ] .",
    "the other two symmetric bell states @xmath105 are transformed into each other , obeying the time - evolution @xmath106 here , @xmath107 is an arbitrary phase .    since the states ( [ psib1 ] )  ( [ psib4 ] ) form a complete basis of the two - qubit system",
    ", we can conclude that a measurement of the current through the qpc can take three possible outcomes : ( i ) @xmath108 , which means that the system is driven into the steady state ( [ psib1 ] ) by the measurement , ( ii ) @xmath109 , which means that the system is driven into the steady state ( [ psib2 ] ) by the measurement , and ( iii ) @xmath110 ( with @xmath111 ) , which means that the system is driven into the state ( [ statedyn ] ) , which exhibits a dynamical detector signal that is both oscillatory and noisy .",
    "this behavior can be demonstrated within a simple model of continuous parity measurement state preparation with a series of projective parity measurements . using a master equation description of the time evolution of the density matrix of the two - qubit system ,",
    "we have verified that the latter model is in agreement with continuous weak measurement . in the master equation description , we have treated the electrons in the qpc as bath variables and integrated out the bath degrees of freedom in the weak coupling and markovian regime .",
    "the resulting master equation is of the lindblad form , where the decay rates are proportional to the auto - correlation function of the input variable of the parity detector .",
    "the algorithm of our model of continuous parity measurement state preparation is as follows :    1 .",
    "fix the desired initial state in the measurement basis",
    ". it can be randomly chosen , or can be fixed as a state that is experimentally simple to prepare .",
    "2 .   apply a unitary transformation to change to the bell basis , where hamiltonian evolution is simple .",
    "more explicitly , if we represent an arbitrary state as @xmath112 a simple basis transformation enables us to write the same state as @xmath113 then , the time evolution in the bell basis is simply given by @xmath114 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "do a parity measurement : * find the probability of getting the result even ( @xmath14 ) , or odd ( @xmath15 ) from the state .",
    "* use these probabilities to choose a random outcome , @xmath14 or @xmath15 . * based on the result , update the state .",
    "transform back to the bell basis .",
    "repeat the algorithm from step 2 .    as mentioned before",
    ", this algorithm gives three possible outcomes : ( i ) the parity meter measures @xmath15 all the time @xmath115 state @xmath116 has been prepared , ( ii ) the parity meter measures @xmath14 all the time @xmath115 state @xmath117 has been prepared , and ( iii ) the parity meter measures a string of a mixture of @xmath15 and @xmath14 results @xmath115 a dynamical superposition of the states @xmath118 and @xmath119 has been prepared , which is not a steady state of @xmath101 . a long sequence of either @xmath15 s or @xmath14 s",
    ", corresponding to cases ( i ) or ( ii ) , indicates a statistically confident preparation of a bell state .",
    "a statistical analysis of our model shows that if we start with a product state in one of the two parity classes , e.g. @xmath120 in the odd class , which can be easily prepared experimentally , then the parity meter drives the system with probability @xmath121 into the bell state @xmath116 .",
    "( the same holds for the other parity class and the bell state @xmath122 . )    if we , however , start with a random state , e.g. a fully mixed state , then the parity meter still accomplishes a bell state preparation of the two states @xmath116 and @xmath122 with a success probability of @xmath123 each .",
    "if there are non - ideal symmetries , e.g. @xmath124 , then , on longer time scales , there will be random switching between the different parity classes .    before proceeding to the next section",
    ", we briefly note that the needed symmetry in the coupling constants between detector and each of the qubits may be tested by dc current measurements , using gate voltages to force the quantum dots into each of the four classical configurations .",
    "if there is any asymmetry , this will show up in a slight current difference when comparing the different configurations .",
    "the difference of the couplings constants can by slightly tuned with the use of top gates .",
    "we describe two applications of the parity meter of interest for quantum information processing .",

    "_ in order to do a measurement of a violation of a bell inequality in the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form , @xcite we have to rotate each qubit and afterwards measure qubit - qubit correlators in different bases .",
    "the single qubit rotation can be done by pulsing @xmath130 and @xmath131 independently of each other .",
    "thus , during this step , we drive the system away from the symmetry point . note that this is the only option to measure the two qubits in different bases , because typical measurement devices for charge qubits can only measure in the @xmath132 basis of the qubit .",

    "[ bmeas ] .",
    "the time delay between the two projective measurements is analogous to the relative phase between the beam - splitters in the original chsh proposal .",
