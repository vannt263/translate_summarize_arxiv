    "the process of supernova remnant expansion evolution has long been the subject of thorough investigation , and as a result we can be confident of a few well established facts . in the initial free expansion stage ,",
    "a tremendous amount of energy in the form of material ejecta is thrown outwards in a ( assumed ) spherically symmetric explosion , driving a shock wave into the ambient medium .",
    "later , when the mass of the swept - up material considerably exceeds the ejected material mass , the supernova remnant enters the sedov stage @xcite , as a reverse shock reaches the center of the remnant and the forward shock undergoes significant deceleration .",
    "this simple picture is complicated by the presence of a pulsar wind nebula expanding within , but separate from , the snr bubble @xcite .",
    "it eventually encounters the reverse shock , which induces complicated radial reverberations , before relaxing into sedov phase expansion @xcite .",
    "each stage of evolution can be described by the expansion parameter @xmath5 , defined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the linear radius and @xmath8 is the remnant age .    in g11.2@xmath00.3",
    ", we find a textbook example of a composite supernova remnant ( snr ) comprising an extremely circular radio and x - ray shell , a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) contained within the snr @xcite , and an x - ray pulsar psr  j1811@xmath01925 @xcite located at the center .",
    "its high surface brightness and the extremely centralized position of the pulsar within the remnant imply that it is much younger than the pulsar s characteristic age , @xmath9 yr @xcite , and support the possible association with the historical supernova ( sn ) event of 386  ad @xcite . furthermore",
    ", this discrepancy suggests the pulsar s current spin period is very near its initial value and that its spin - down energy , @xmath10 ergs / s , has remained nearly constant since the supernova explosion .",
    "g11.2@xmath00.3 is an ideal snr for detailed study due to the observability of emission from all of its components , either at hard x - ray , thermal x - ray or radio frequencies ; for a description of its radio and x - ray properties see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of performing an expansion measurement is to set unambiguous upper and lower limits on its age by examining the expected behaviour of the outer shock during the free expansion ( high velocity ) and sedov ( low velocity ) phases .",
    "we obtained 20- and 6-cm data of g11.2@xmath00.3 taken during 1984@xmath085 ( epoch 1 ) from the vla archival database .",
    "details of these observations can be found in table 1 of @xcite ; data from 1985 february were omitted from this analysis due to poor calibration .",
    "our recent observations made during 2001@xmath002 ( epoch 2 ) at 20 and 6 cm ( 1465 and 4860 mhz , respectively ) are outlined in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the data processing was performed using standard procedures within the miriad package @xcite , in mosaic and multi - frequency synthesis mode .",
    "we performed calibration and editing on each data set individually , before combining all the data of a particular frequency band and epoch .",
    "the primary gains were determined using 3c  286 and 3c  48 , and phase calibrations were made from observations of 1743@xmath0038 , 1751@xmath0096 , 1751@xmath0253 and 1820@xmath0254 ( j2000 ) .",
    "imaging was performed with robust weighting @xcite as a compromise between maximized signal - to - noise and resolution .",
    "we utilized the maximum entropy method ( mem ) algorithm for deconvolution @xcite , and applied self - calibration iteratively to improve phase and amplitude calibrations .",
    "the vla and other radio interferometers have been used to measure the expansion of many snr such as g11.2@xmath00.3 . for a summary of remnants and the techniques used to study them ,",
    "see @xcite and the references therein . because it is not always possible to make new observations with the same @xmath11 coverage as the archival data , it is important to match up as many of the properties which might affect the quality of our results as best possible , before attempting to directly compare the final images from each epoch .",
    "we used the final self - calibrated epoch 2 clean map , after correcting it for primary beam attenuation , as the model for self - calibrating epoch 1 data , as described by @xcite in his cross - calibration method .",
    "the purpose of this step was to apply the same residual calibration errors to epoch 1 as existed in epoch 2 , thereby minimizing the effects of self - calibration errors on the final subtracted map . in order to match the spatial scales of our images at both epochs , we used miriad modelling procedures to spacially filter the @xmath11 coverage of epoch 2 data to match that at epoch 1 , thus creating an epoch 2 dataset with degraded visibility coverage @xcite .    rather than subtract our maps in the @xmath11 plane as done by @xcite , we instead mimicked the direct approaches of @xcite and @xcite ( used to measure the remnant expansions of sn  1006 ad and tycho s sn ( 3c  10 ) , respectively ) who adopted procedures outlined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . using the miriad task imdiff",
    ", we fit the five parameters , described by the maximum likelihood algorithm of @xcite , between our final images : expansion , amplitude ( the mean brightness ratio between epochs ) , x - shift ( in the negative right ascension direction ) , y - shift ( declination ) , and dc offset ( the difference in background brightness levels ) .",
    "the best - fit geometrical center of the shell was found to be @xmath12 from the position of psr j1811@xmath01925 .",
    "we then fixed the amplitude , x - shift , y - shift and offset at the fitted values , performed a series of image subtractions of epoch 1 from epoch 2 , each time artificially scaling the epoch 1 image by an expansion factor between 0% and 1.5% in steps of 0.1% , and examined the radial profiles of each difference image for the best - fit expansion factor , or more specifically , the profile that most resembled a line of zero slope .",
    "it was evident when examining the difference images that 1.5% was a sufficiently large upper bound on the expansion factor .",
    "the difference images were convolved with gaussians whose fwhm were the same as the synthesized beams ( @xmath13 at 20 cm , @xmath14 at 6 cm ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dif ] shows a map of epoch 2 minus epoch 1 at 20 cm with zero expansion .",
    "we divided the remnant into 24 wedge - shaped regions of @xmath15 azimuthally , and found the average flux of each difference image in annular ring sections as a function of radius between 1@xmath16 and 3@xmath16 , recalling that the radius of g11.2@xmath00.3 is @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of averaging over wedges , as opposed to simply taking radial cuts , was to smooth out small fluctuations that might have corrupted our data @xcite .",
    "the next task was to determine which of these profiles of average residual flux vs. radius most resembled a flat line .",
    "a straightforward @xmath18 analysis was not possible , due to our lacking measured uncertainties @xmath19 on the residual profile data points .",
    "therefore , we chose to take a modified approach to @xmath18-fitting in the hopes of obtaining somewhat legitimate error bars .",
    "we weighted each profile data point according to the total intensity in that region at that radius , in lieu of @xmath19 , and calculated @xmath18 at each expansion value using a flat line as the expected difference profile . to find the best expansion and uncertainties for a particular region",
    ", we divided the @xmath18 values by the minimum @xmath18 of that region ; therefore , when we fitted the values to a parabola , its minimum was forced to be near 1 . the best expansion was determined by the location of the minima , and the @xmath20 errors from the location of @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted that although these error bars do not represent @xmath20 in the traditional sense , they do provide a rough indication of each measurement s precision .",
    "figure  [ fig : exp ] contains a plot of the best expansion rate estimates as a function of azimuthal angle .",
    "as expected , the largest uncertainies correspond to the regions of the shell that are most diffuse , specifically the south - western quadrant ( between @xmath22 and @xmath23 w of n ) .",
    "we calculate the weighted mean expansion rate for the entire shell , and find the overall expansion during the @xmath24 yr period separating the epochs to be ( @xmath1)% from 20-cm data and ( @xmath25)% from 6-cm data .",
    "this corresponds to a rate of @xmath26/yr and @xmath27/yr ( from 20- and 6-cm data , respectively ) .",
    "the uncertainties represent the rms deviation about the weighted mean .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath28 will later be used to constrain a rough estimate of the age of g11.2@xmath00.3 ; here , we assume that the age is equivalent to the time since sn 386  ad , @xmath29 yr , and calculate @xmath30 ( 20 cm ) and @xmath31 ( 6 cm ) . we do not know why there exists a general trend in the difference between the two sets of results , making the expansion at 20 cm appear consistently greater than that at 6 cm ; however , we note that the 6-cm data is more susceptible to errors in primary beam correction and incomplete @xmath11 coverage .",
    "even so , the error bars on our data points overlap significantly and the calculated mean expansion values agree within our scatter - based uncertainties .    as an independent check",
    ", we compare our measured expansion with the general overall expansion for the entire remnant as fit by imdiff .",
    "our results agree with the fit values of 0.7% and 0.5% at 20- and 6-cm , respectively .",
    "in the first phase of sn evolution , the outer shock wave freely expands into the surrounding medium such that @xmath32 , and the mass of the ejected material @xmath33 is much greater than the mass of swept up material @xmath34 .",
    "as the forward shock begins to decelerate , a reverse shock is driven towards the center of the snr where it interacts with the pwn , if present @xcite .",
    "eventually these interactions dissipate as the snr enters the sedov phase . at this stage ,",
    "@xmath35 , and the expansion is described by the sedov solution @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "interactions between the sn shock front and its ambient medium , which has a density profile thought to be affected by a circumstellar wind produced by pre - supernova mass loss of type  ii sn , are currently the subject of extensive investigations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 values predicted for such an environment tend to lie between the extreme values of free expansion and the classical sedov solution for a constant density medium .",
    "therefore , we will consider these classical definitions for now .",
    "assuming that g11.2@xmath00.3 has been in either the free expansion or sedov state continuously since birth , we use our above results and the definition of @xmath5 to calculate upper and lower constraints on its age , where @xmath37 and ( 0.0050 @xmath38 0.0017 ) . from our 20-cm result , we find upper and lower age limits , corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively : @xmath41  yr , @xmath42  yr . likewise , from the 6-cm result we find @xmath43  yr and @xmath44  yr .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the result of this calculation is highly inconsistent with the characteristic age of psr  j1811@xmath01925 , @xmath9 yr ; it is , however , of the same order of magnitude as the time passed since sn 386 ad , and indeed 1616  yr falls easily within these constraints . to eliminate any doubt as to the association between the pulsar and snr , see the detailed discussion by @xcite ; also discussed are the implications of this age discrepancy on young pulsar astronomy .    although the pwn is not bright enough to measure a rate of expansion in a similar fashion , we find the presence of flux outlining the general region of the pwn in the zero expansion difference image noteworthy ( see figure  [ fig : dif ] ) .",
    "the positive emission is indicative of positive expansion ; therefore , we conclude that the reverse shock is not compressing the pwn shock front and the snr is not yet in the sedov phase .",
    "we look to the study of nonradiative snr evolution by @xcite , who predict analytically and numerically the expected forward blastwave and reverse shock positions throughout a remnant s lifetime , for a corrobrative explanation .",
    "based on the fact that g11.2@xmath00.3 is likely 1616  yr old , and the expansion parameters we find corresponding to that age , we estimate roughly that the snr reverse shock radius is currently between 0.5 and 0.8 times the forward blastwave shock radius , assuming a typical ejecta mass for type  ii sn of 3@xmath05 @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio of pwn to snr diameter is @xmath46 , so the reverse shock would not be expected to have reached the pwn yet .",
    "this agrees with what we observe in figure  [ fig : dif ] , as well as conclusions outlined in @xcite based on the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we refer to @xcite , who predicts that the initial expansion phase of a snr with a red supergiant progenitor can be described by a self - similar solution with a value of @xmath47 , as long as both the circumstellar material and the stellar envelope density distributions are power - laws in radius .",
    "this is considerably higher than our @xmath5 estimates , based on @xmath29 yr , of roughly 0.48 to 0.68 , which suggests that the transition from the initial phase to the sedov phase is well under way .",
    "the distance to g11.2@xmath00.3 is estimated by considering its expansion and angular size . given the relations @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the shell s spatial velocity , @xmath51 is the angular radius , and @xmath52 is the distance to the remnant , it can be seen that @xmath53 to find the velocity of the shell , we consider the mach number of the snr shock front @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the sound velocity @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath56 , and the ratio of pressure to particle mass density is given by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the temperature of the surrounding material and @xmath59 is the mean mass per particle ( @xmath60 for cosmic abundances , @xmath61 is proton mass ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath62 for a strong shock in an ideal gas .",
    "we measure the temperature behind the shock @xmath63 k from x - ray spectral fits @xcite ; however , @xmath64 is the ion temperature and if the electrons are not in full thermal equilibrium with the ions , the observed spectrum may underestimate the shock temperature , and our distance estimate will be too small by a factor of @xmath65 @xcite . combining the above information we find @xmath66 which gives a lower bound on the distance estimate : @xmath67 @xcite previously estimated a minimum distance of @xmath68  kpc to the remnant based on its spectrum .",
    "fits to the x - ray spectrum with the npshock model of @xcite suggest that the electrons are near equilibrium ; therefore , the distance derived assuming total equilibrium should be very close to that at near equilibrium , and , hence , not much greater than the minimum distance .",
    "based on radio interferometric images of snr g11.2@xmath00.3 we have made a simple measurement of the outer shell expansion and found a mean rate of @xmath3/yr from 20-cm data , and @xmath4/yr from 6-cm data .",
    "if we compare the expected age of g11.2@xmath00.3 , determined by our measurements , with the characteristic age of its associated pulsar psr  j1811@xmath01925 , we find an order of magnitude discrepancy ; our result further strengthens the growing body of evidence linking g11.2@xmath00.3 with the historical sn of 386  ad .",
    "the evolutionary status of this snr appears to be pre - sedov , a conclusion that agrees with other observational evidence , as well as theoretical arguments .",
    "we also estimate the distance to the remnant based on its x - ray shock velocity to be @xmath69 kpc and find it consistent with previously published results .",
