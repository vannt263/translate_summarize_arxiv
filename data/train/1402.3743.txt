    "ultracold bosonic gases with dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) have drawn a great deal of attention in the last years , which is stimulated by new experimental achievements in the achievement of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in gases made of atoms carrying permanent magnetic moments , such as chromium @xcite , dysprosium @xcite , and erbium @xcite , and the development of efficient theoretical methods for the analysis of such condensates @xcite .",
    "the long - range and anisotropic character of the ddi leads to new physical phenomena , which are not expected in bec with contact interactions , see reviews  @xcite . among these phenomena",
    "well known are pattern - formation scenarios @xcite , the @xmath0-wave collapse @xcite , nonlocally coupled solitons in stacked systems @xcite , multidimensional anisotropic solitons @xcite , solitons in dipolar condensates in optical lattices  @xcite , and others .",
    "in addition to direct - current ( dc ) external magnetic fields , various configurations of dipolar condensates can be also controlled by combinations including alternating - current ( ac ) components @xcite .",
    "another novel and potentially important ingredient available in bec settings is spatially periodic modulation of the local strength of the contact interactions by means of the feshbach resonance controlled by periodically patterned laser or magnetic fields , as considered , e.g. , in @xcite , leading to the concept of optically or magnetically induced _",
    "nonlinear lattices_. the nonlinearity modulation in space gives rise to new types of solitons and solitary vortices , as summarized in review  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was recently demonstrated that periodic modulation of the local orientation of permanent atomic or molecular dipole moments in an effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting , which may be induced by a periodically inhomogeneous external polarizing field , makes it possible to create ddi - induced _ nonlocal _ nonlinear lattices in atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "the necessary periodic field structure can be built using the available technique of magnetic lattices @xcite , or similar ferroelectric lattices ( see , e.g . ,",
    "@xcite ) . the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was focused on 1d solitons in the dipolar condensate with periodic variations of the angle between dipoles .",
    "another possibility for the creation of nonlocal nonlinear lattices and the study of self - trapped matter - wave modes in them is to use a bosonic gas of polarizable particles , which do not carry permanent dipole moments , while a spatially periodic distribution of the dipolar density is _ induced _ by an external spatially varying _ polarizing field _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , a promising possibility is to consider an ultracold gas of polarizable molecules , with dipole moments induced by a spatially modulated dc electric field ( such periodic settings were not considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the ddi in gases of field - induced dipoles may be very strong and give rise to a number of significant effects  @xcite .    in the present work we consider a quasi-1d dipolar bec with electric dipole moments of particles induced by the dc field with the local strength periodically varying in space , while its direction is uniform , being oriented along the system s axis , thus giving rise to the attractive ddi in the condensate ( on the contrary to the repulsive interactions between induced dipoles polarized perpendicular to the system s axis or plane , which was the subject of the analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "the objective is to investigate the existence and stability of bright solitons in this system , controlled by the effective ddi - induced nonlocal nonlinear lattice .",
    "the mobility and collisions of the solitons are considered too .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the models is presented in sec .",
    "ii , which is followed by the study of the existence and stability of bright solitons in sec .",
    "results for dynamics and collision of solitons are reported in sec .",
    "iv . conclusions and perspectives are summarized in sec .",
    "we consider the condensate elongated along axis @xmath1 , with dipole moments of polarizable molecules or atoms induced by an external field directed along @xmath1 too . the local strength of the polarizing field also varies along @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , one can use the effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , with the ddi term derived from the underlying 3d gpe , as shown below .",
    "the necessary spatially modulated dc electric and/or magnetic field can be imposed , as said above , by ferroelectric or ferromagnetic lattices .",
    "below , we consider local dipole moment induced by a polarizing electric field .",
    "one can also consider magnetic dipole moments induced by a solenoid , as shown at the end of this section .",
    "in addition to the ferroelectric lattice , the periodic modulation of the strength of the electric field oriented _ perpendicular _ to the system s axis ( @xmath1 ) can be provided by a capacitor with the separation between its electrodes modulated in @xmath1 periodically , as per eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) written below , cf .",
    "however , the most essential part of the analysis is developed below for the periodically modulated strength of the electric field directed _ along _ @xmath1 , to fix the attractive character of the respective ddi .",
    "this configuration of the electric field can be provided by a stacked capacitor built along the @xmath1 axis ( with the array of parallel electrodes made as grids , to prevent interference with the bec flow along the axis ) , assuming periodic modulation of the dc voltage applied to adjacent pairs of electrodes .",

    "typical values of the parameters are : @xmath18 1 debye , @xmath19 @xmath20 ghz , which yields an estimate for the necessary electric - field strength , @xmath21 v@xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "such fields are accessible to experiments with bec in atomic gases ( see appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the spatial variation of the strength of the polarizing dc electric field , @xmath24 leads to the respective spatial modulation of the ddi , with @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , the periodic variation of the field , such as that adopted below in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , induces the above - mentioned effective nonlocal nonlinear lattice in the gpe .    to derive the equation for the wave function in the quasi-1d case , we use the method elaborated in ref .",
    "if the ground state in the transverse plane , @xmath26 , is imposed by the trapping potential , the 3d wave function may be factorized as usual @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . substituting this expression into ( [ eq3 ] ) and integrating over @xmath30",

    "note that the ddi can be represented by a pseudopotential which includes a contact - interaction ( delta - functional ) term @xcite .",
    "then , spatially modulated @xmath45 may induce a position - depending part of the contact interactions too .",
    "such a combination of nonlinear local and dipolar lattices may be a subject of interest for a separate investigation .",
    "however , in the present setting , the regularization scale @xmath46 in kernel ( [ v1d ] ) eliminates the singular part of the ddi at scales @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , in the present work we restrict ourselves to the consideration of the pure nonlinear nonlocal lattice .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the system in the perpendicular directions is completely frozen , i.e. , the transverse trapping frequency , @xmath48 , is much larger then the longitudinal one , @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath50 is not too large , interesting transverse effects may occur , such as the einstein - de haas effect  @xcite , the consideration of which is beyond the scope of the present work .    in the potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we can identify the usual harmonic - trap potential , @xmath51 , nonlinear term @xmath52 accounting for the collisional interaction , and an effective ddi potential , composed of linear and a nonlinear terms : @xmath53 ,   \\label{ddipot}\\ ] ] where the modulation function [ see eq .",
