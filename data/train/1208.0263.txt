    "the calculation of heavy - ion interaction potentials is of fundamental importance for the study of fusion reactions between stable and neutron - rich nuclei , and for the study of superheavy element production .",
    "we have developed a fully microscopic method to extract ion - ion potentials directly from the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) time - evolution of the nuclear system .",
    "the only input is the effective nn interaction ( skyrme ) , and there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "radioactive ion beam facilities have opened up the possibility to study fusion reactions of neutron - rich nuclei . in many cases ,",
    "the dynamics of the neutron rich skin of these nuclei enhances the sub - barrier fusion cross section over that predicted by a simple static barrier penetration model , but in some cases suppression of fusion is also observed .",
    "very recently , at the hribf facility a series of experiments has been carried out with radioactive @xmath0sn beams on @xmath5ca targets  @xcite . also , at the ganil - spiral facility a reaccelerated beam of @xmath6o was used to measure near- and sub - barrier fusion with a @xmath4c target  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory provides a useful foundation for a fully microscopic many - body theory of large amplitude collective motion  @xcite including deep - inelastic and fusion reactions .",
    "recently it has become feasible , for the first time , to perform tdhf calculations on a 3d cartesian grid without any symmetry restrictions and with much more accurate numerical methods  @xcite . at the same time the quality of effective interactions has also been substantially improved  @xcite . during the past several years , we have developed the dc - tdhf method for calculating heavy - ion potentials  @xcite , and we have applied this method to calculate fusion and capture cross sections above and below the barrier .",
    "so far , we have studied the systems @xmath0sn+@xmath7ni  @xcite , @xmath7ni+@xmath7ni , @xmath8o+@xmath9pb  @xcite , @xmath10sn+@xmath11zr , and we have studied the entrance channel dynamics of hot and cold fusion reactions leading to superheavy element @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have investigated sub - barrier fusion and pre - equilibrium giant resonance excitation between various tin + calcium isotopes  @xcite and calcium + calcium isotopes  @xcite .",
    "last not least , we have studied sub - barrier fusion reactions between both stable and neutron - rich isotopes of oxygen and carbon  @xcite that occur in the neutron star crust . in all cases , we have found good agreement between the measured fusion cross sections and the dc - tdhf results .",
    "this is rather remarkable given the fact that the only input in dc - tdhf is the skyrme effective n - n interaction , and there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "the tdhf equations of motion are obtained from the variational principle @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the quantum many - body hamiltonian of the system consisting of kinetic energy and coulomb / nuclear two - body interactions .",
    "the main approximation in tdhf is that the many - body wave function @xmath15 is assumed to be a single time - dependent slater determinant which consists of an anti - symmetrized product of single - particle wave functions @xmath16 the variational principle confined to the subspace of slater determinants yields the tdhf equations for the single - particle wave functions @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the mean - field hamiltonian .    in the present tdhf calculations we use the skyrme sly4 interaction  @xcite for the nucleons including all of the time - odd terms in the mean - field hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out on a 3d cartesian lattice . for @xmath5ca+@xmath0sn",
    "the lattice spans @xmath19  fm along the collision axis and @xmath20  fm in the other two directions , depending on the impact parameter .",
    "derivative operators on the lattice are represented by the basis - spline collocation method .",
    "one of the major advantages of this method is that we may use a relatively large grid spacing of @xmath21  fm and nevertheless achieve high numerical accuracy .",
    "first we generate very accurate static hf wave functions for the two nuclei on the 3d grid .",
    "the static hf equations are solved with the damped gradient iteration method .",
    "the initial separation of the two nuclei is @xmath22  fm for central collisions . in the second step ,",
    "we apply a boost operator to the single - particle wave functions .",
    "the time - propagation is carried out using a taylor series expansion ( up to orders @xmath23 ) of the unitary mean - field propagator , with a time step @xmath24  fm / c .    in figures  [ fig : dens22.0],[fig : dens11.8],[fig : dens10.4],[fig : dens9.66 ] we show contour plots of the tdhf mass density for a central collision of @xmath2ca+@xmath0sn at @xmath25  mev .",
    "the density distributions are shown as a function of time , or equivalently , as a function of the internuclear distance @xmath26 .",

    "in the absence of a true quantum many - body theory of barrier tunneling , sub - barrier fusion calculations are reduced to the calculation of a potential barrier between the interacting nuclei and a subsequent calculation of tunneling through the barrier  @xcite . to date , theoretical studies of fusion cross sections are still dominated by phenomenological methods such as the coupled - channels ( cc ) approach  @xcite . in this approach , one either uses empirical parameterizations of the ion - ion potential ( e.g. woods - saxon ) or one calculates the potential with the double - folding method using experimental or theoretical nuclear densities for projectile and target . in the latter case ,",
    "one relies on the `` frozen density '' or `` sudden '' approximation in which the nuclear densities are unchanged during the computation of the ion - ion potential as a function of the internuclear distance .",
    "the frozen density approximation ignores dynamical effects such as neck formation during the nuclear overlap .",
    "it has been demonstrated that for deep sub - barrier energies the inner part of the potential barrier plays a very important role  @xcite .",
    "while phenomenological methods provide a useful starting point for the analysis of fusion data , it is desirable to use a microscopic many - body theory . we have developed a fully microscopic method to extract heavy - ion interaction potentials @xmath29 from the tdhf time - evolution of the dinuclear system .    in our dc - tdhf approach , the time - evolution takes place with no restrictions . at certain times",
    "@xmath30 or , equivalently , at certain internuclear distances @xmath31 the instantaneous tdhf density @xmath32 is used to perform a static hartree - fock energy minimization @xmath33 while constraining the proton and neutron densities to be equal to the instantaneous tdhf densities @xmath34 these equations determine the state vector @xmath35 .",
    "this means we allow the single - particle wave functions to rearrange themselves in such a way that the total energy is minimized , subject to the tdhf density constraint .",
    "we have a self - organizing system which selects its path following the dynamics given by the microscopic tdhf equations .    in a typical dc - tdhf run , we utilize a few thousand time steps , and the density constraint is applied every @xmath36 time steps .",
    "we refer to the minimized energy as the `` density constrained energy '' @xmath37 @xmath38 the ion - ion interaction potential @xmath29 is essentially the same as @xmath37 , except that it is renormalized by subtracting the constant binding energies @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the two individual nuclei @xmath41 the interaction potentials calculated with the dc - tdhf method incorporate all of the dynamical entrance channel effects such as neck formation , particle exchange , internal excitations , and deformation effects . while the outer part of the potential barrier is largely determined by the entrance channel properties ,",
    "the inner part of the potential barrier is strongly sensitive to dynamical effects such as particle transfer and neck formation .    using tdhf dynamics , it is also possible to compute the corresponding coordinate dependent mass parameter @xmath42 using energy conservation at zero impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "as expected , at large distance @xmath26 the mass @xmath42 is equal to the reduced mass @xmath43 of the system . at smaller distances ,",
    "when the nuclei overlap , the mass parameter increases in all cases .",
    "instead of solving the schrdinger equation with coordinate dependent mass parameter @xmath42 it is numerically advantageous to use the constant reduced mass @xmath43 and to transfer the coordinate - dependence of the mass to a scaled potential using a scale transformation ( for details , see  @xcite ) . for simplicity of notation",
    ", we denote this transformed potential in the following by @xmath29 . in general , we observe that the coordinate - dependent mass changes only the interior region of the potential barriers , and this change is most pronounced at low @xmath44 energies .    the schrdinger equation for the coordinate @xmath26 involving constant reduced mass @xmath43 and transformed potential @xmath29 has the familiar form @xmath45 \\psi_{\\ell}(r ) = 0 \\;. \\label{eq : schroed1}\\ ] ] by numerical integration of eq .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : pot_132sn+40ca_v3 ] we show heavy - ion interaction potentials for @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca calculated with the dc - tdhf method .",
    "the potentials have been transformed so that they correspond to a constant reduced mass @xmath43 . in general , the potentials are energy - dependent and they are shown here at four different tdhf energies .",

    "also shown are experimental data obtained at hribf  @xcite .",
    "the main point of this display is to demonstrate that the energy - dependence of the heavy - ion potential is crucial for an understanding of the strong fusion enhancement at subbarrier energies . at very high energy ( @xmath49  mev )",
    "the potential approaches the limit of the frozen density approximation : the collision is so fast that the nuclei have no time to rearrange their densities .",
    "we observe that the measured fusion cross sections at energies @xmath54  mev are well - described by this high - energy potential . at low energies , however , the situation is quite different : due to the slow motion of the nuclei , the nuclear densities have time to rearrange resulting in neck formation , surface vibrations , particle transfer , and the interior region of the heavy - ion potential is strongly modified .",
    "these effects ( which are included in tdhf ) lower the fusion barrier as described above , thus strongly enhancing the subbarrier fusion cross section .",
    "we observe that the data points measured at the two lowest energies @xmath55 and @xmath56  mev can be understood by the heavy - ion potential calculated at @xmath51  mev .",

    ", we have interpolated the theoretical cross sections obtained with the energy - dependent dc - tdhf potentials  @xcite .",
    "we can see that our theoretical cross sections agree remarkably well with the experimental data .",
    "if one compares the fusion cross sections for both systems at low energies , one finds the surprising result that fusion of @xmath0sn with @xmath1ca yields a larger cross section than with @xmath2ca .",
    "for example , at @xmath58 mev we find an experimental cross section of @xmath59 mb for @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca as compared to @xmath60 mb for the more neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath2ca .",
    "this behavior can be understood by examining the corresponding heavy - ion potentials which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot2 ] .",
    "both potentials have been calculated at the same center - of - mass energy @xmath61  mev .",
    "we observe that while the barrier heights and positions for both systems are approximately the same , the _ width _ of the dc - tdhf potential barrier for @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca is substantially smaller than for @xmath0sn+@xmath2ca , resulting in enhanced sub - barrier fusion at low energy .",
    "fusion of very neutron rich nuclei may be important to determine the composition and heating of the crust of accreting neutron stars  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_c+o ] we show the dc - tdhf potential barriers for the c@xmath62o system .",

    "the barrier for the @xmath4c@xmath62 @xmath64o system occurs at a slightly larger @xmath26 value with a barrier peak of @xmath65  mev .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_fus_c+o ] shows the corresponding cross sections for the two reactions .",
    "also shown are the experimental data from ref .",
    "the dc - tdhf potential reproduces the experimental cross - sections quite well for the @xmath4c@xmath62 @xmath8o system , and the cross section for the neutron rich @xmath4c+@xmath64o is predicted to be larger than that for @xmath4c + @xmath8o .",
    "we have compared our results to the phenomenological so paulo barrier penetration model which calculates an effective potential by folding over static densities for the projectile and target .",
    "there are interesting differences between our calculations and the so paulo model . for the asymmetric systems @xmath4c+@xmath64o or",
    "@xmath8o+@xmath64o we predict an order of magnitude larger cross section than for the so paulo model .",
    "this is likely due to dynamical effects that change the nuclear densities during the collision process caused by the rearrangement of the single - particle wave functions .",
