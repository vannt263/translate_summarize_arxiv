    "@xcite , considered an observer outside a black hole , interacting with ( perturbing ) the event horizon .",
    "surprisingly , they found that the observer will experience the perturbations of the  stretched \" horizon as modes of a viscous fluid possessing electric charge and conductivity .",
    "this inspired a host of works over the years but the connection between gravitational physics and fluids became sharper with the advent of the ads / cft correspondence when policastro et .",
    "al @xcite related the shear viscosity of @xmath1 super yang - mills theory to the absorption of energy by a black brane .",
    "this was the start of using the holographic principle , that is the correspondence between gravitational theories on @xmath2-dimensional manifolds and @xmath3-dimensional quantum field theories , as a tool for calculating hydrodynamic properties .",
    "more recently , there has been a set of works that directly relate solutions of einstein s equations of a particular type to solutions to the navier - stokes equations in one dimension less @xcite .",
    "later we will review the details of how this correspondence is derived but the essential flavour is as follows .",
    "one writes down a very particular ansatz for the metric in @xmath4 dimensions which has undetermined functions , @xmath5 and parameter , @xmath6 with the index @xmath7 i.e. over a @xmath8 subset of the @xmath3 spacetime dimensions . solving the einstein equations then constrains the functions @xmath5 to give a set of second order nonlinear differential equations for @xmath5 .",
    "this set of equations are the navier - stokes equations describing a fluid in @xmath3 dimensions with pressure , @xmath9 , fluid velocity field @xmath10 and viscosity @xmath6 .",
    "thus particular solutions to the navier - stokes equations provide particular solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "other recent work on the fluid / gravity correspondence may be found in @xcite .",
    "it has been known since buchdahl @xcite that for manifolds with isometries einstein s equations have solution generating symmetries .",
    "that is there are  hidden \" symmetries of the equations that map from one solution to the other .",
    "in fact there is a vast set of these as described by ehler @xcite and geroch @xcite .",
    "the question we wish to pose in this paper is whether the solution generating symmetries of einstein s equations can lead to solution generating symmetries in the navier - stokes equations ?    the procedure to determine this will be as follows :    * impose a killing symmetry in a spacetime that admits the metric ansatz corresponding to the navier - stokes equations ; * carry out generalised ehler s transformations that preserve the ansatz ; * determine the induced transformation of the navier - stokes data i.e. @xmath11 .    the procedure could immediately fail if there were no generalized ehler s transformations that preserve the metric ansatz required for the fluid / gravity correspondence .",
    "we will find that there are a finite set and we will be able to explore the transformations on the navier - stokes fields for different choices of killing directions in spacetime . along the way we will show that they are not part of the usual spacetime ehler s transformations and yet they do produce solution generating transformations for the navier - stokes fields .    the paper will try to be as self contained as possible and so we begin with a review of the necessary ideas in fluids ; the navier - stokes equation ; the fluid gravity correspondence ; and solution generating symmetries in general relativity .",
    "we will then carry out the procedure described above for spatial , timelike and null killing vectors to see what solution generating symmetries they correspond to in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "we end with some comments and ideas for future work .",
    "a reader familiar with the formalism of hydrodynamics and the navier - stokes equation may wish to skip directly to section 3 where we carry out the solution generating transformation in the gravity dual to see the resulting induced transformations on the solutions of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the study of hydrodynamics is fundamental to vast areas of physics and engineering , owing to its origin as the long - wavelength limit of any interacting field theory at finite temperature .",
    "such a limit needs a consistent definition .",
    "consider a quantum field theory where quanta interact with a characteristic length scale @xmath12 , the correlation length .",
    "the long - wavelength limit simply requires that fluctuations of the thermodynamic quantities of the system vary with a length scale @xmath13 much greater than @xmath12 , parameterized by the dimensionless knudsen number @xmath14 for a fluid description to be useful in non - equilibrium states , we naturally require that @xmath13 remain small compared to the size of the system .",
    "this is usually satisfied trivially by considering systems of infinite size .",
    "the long - wavelength limit allows the definition of a particle as an element of the macroscopic fluid , infinitesimal with respect to the size of the system , yet containing a sufficiently large number of microscopic quanta .",
    "one mole contains an avogadro s number of molecules , for example .",
    "each particle defines a local patch of the fluid in thermal equilibrium , that is , thermodynamic quantities do not vary within the particle .",
    "away from global equilibrium quantities vary between particles as function of time @xmath15 and spatial coordinates @xmath16 , combined as @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of particles in the fluid is parameterized by a relativistic velocity @xmath18 , which refers to the velocity of the fluid at @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the thermodynamic quantities , such as the temperature @xmath20 and the density @xmath21 , are determined by the value of any two of them , along with the equation of state .",
    "the evolution of the system is then specified by the equations of hydrodynamics in terms of a set of transport coefficients , whose values depend on the fluid in question .",
    "fluid flow is in general relativistic in that the systems it describes are constrained by local lorentz invariance , and velocities may take any physical values below the speed of light .",
    "applications at relativistic velocities are multitudinous : the dust clouds in galaxy and star formation ; the flow of plasmas and gases in stars supporting fusion ; the superfluid cores of neutron stars ; the horizons of black holes are all described by hydrodynamics .",
    "modelling black holes ( and black branes in m / string theory ) with hydrodynamics has now developed into a fundamental correspondence of central importance to our present study , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : fluid - gravity ] .",
    "quark - gluon plasmas behave as nearly ideal fluids and are expected to have formed after the inflationary epoch of the big bang , are reproduced in collisions at the rhic and lhc .",
    "non - relativistic fluids are equally ubiquitous , somewhat more familiar , and constitute an endless list of phenomena from the atmosphere to the oceans .",
    "we begin with a discussion , adapted from @xcite , of the relativistic fluid described by the stress energy tensor @xmath22 and a set of conserved currents @xmath23 where @xmath24 indexes the corresponding conserved charge .",
    "the dynamical equations of the @xmath3-spacetime dimensional fluid are @xmath25 for an ideal fluid , with no dissipation , the energy - momentum tensor and currents may be expressed in a local rest frame in the form    [ tjideal]@xmath26    where @xmath27 is the pressure , @xmath28 are the conserved charges and @xmath29 is the metric of the space on which the fluid propagates .",
    "the velocity is normalised to @xmath30 .",
    "the entropy current is given by with the charge @xmath31 being given by the local entropy density .",
    "the conservation of the entropy current illustrates the non - dissipative nature intrinsic to zero entropy production .    in a dissipative fluid",
    ", there are corrections to .",
    "we must first take into account the interrelation between mass and energy to define the velocity field more rigorously .",
    "this is achieved by using the landau gauge , which requires that the velocity be an eigenvector of the stress - energy tensor with eigenvalue the local energy density of the fluid ( this is satisfied by the velocity normalisation for the ideal fluid ) .",
    "if the stress energy tensor gains a dissipative term @xmath32 , and the current a term @xmath33 , this reads @xmath34 dissipative corrections to the stress tensor are constructed in a derivative expansion of the velocity field and thermodynamic variables , where derivatives implicitly scale with the infinitesimal knudsen number .",
    "recalling that the equations of motion for the ideal fluid are composed of relations between these gradients , we may express @xmath32 purely in terms of the derivative of the velocity ( when charges are present this is only true to to first order ) .",
    "this can be iterated to all orders in the expansion .",
    "now , the derivative of the velocity may be decomposed using the acceleration @xmath35 , divergence @xmath36 , a symmetric traceless shear @xmath37 , and the antisymmetric vorticity @xmath38 into the form @xmath39 where @xmath40}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 is a projection operator onto spatial directions . in the landau frame",
    ", only the divergence and shear can contribute to first - order stress - energy tensor . a similar analysis for the charge current retains the acceleration , and if one includes the parity - violating pseudo - vector contribution @xmath42 the leading order dissipative equations of motion for a relativistic fluid are with    [ tjdiss]@xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the shear in  [ sec : non - rel ns ] .",
    "] and bulk viscosities respectively , @xmath46 is the matrix of charge diffusion coefficients , @xmath47 indicates the contribution of the temperature gradients and @xmath48 the pseudo - vector transport coefficients .",
    "the transport coefficients have been calculated in the weakly coupled qft in perturbation theory , whereas in the strongly coupled theory , a dual holographic description may be employed , see e.g. @xcite .      in the non - relativistic limit defined by long distances , long times and low velocity and pressure amplitudes ( see e.g @xcite ) ,",

    "we will mostly be concerned with fluid flow in the absence of external forces , where @xmath49 is zero .",
    "a metric dual to the non - relativistic incompressible navier - stokes equations was first developed in @xcite on the rindler wedge , up to third order in the non - relativistic , small amplitude expansion detailed later in this section .",
    "an algorithm for generalising this metric to all orders was subsequently developed in @xcite , though terms calculated beyond third order are not universal .",

    "we discuss whether the fluid transformations of  [ sec : spacelike ] , derived directly from the generalized ehlers transformation on the basis of definition of the dual metric components , lie within the spacetime ehlers group .",
    "the spacetime ehlers map is defined only in @xmath124 spacetime dimensions , so we assume this number of dimensions for all calculations in this section .",
    "consider the fixed boundary transformations .",
    "for those examples calculated in  [ sec : spacelike ] , the ernst scalar transforms as @xmath218    in the case of the vacuum - to - vacuum spacetime ehlers group , the ernst scalar transforms according to the mbius map . if conjugation of the ernst scalar is to belong to this map , we must have @xmath219 which is satisfied if and only if @xmath220 .",
    "explicit calculation for those examples in  [ sec : spacelike ] shows that @xmath220 requires @xmath221 .",
    "the mbius map with these parameter values reduces to @xmath222 that is , complex conjugation and the mbius map are equivalent only where they describe a constant complex shift .",
    "it follows from the definition of complex conjugation that this demands a vanishing twist potential . for those fluid transformations of  [ sec : spacelike ]",
    ", the twist potential is non - vanishing , so complex conjugation of the ernst scalar does not here correspond to the mbius map .",
    "therefore these fluid transformations , generated by the generalized ehlers group on the basis of the dual metric definition , do not correspond to transformations within the spacetime ehlers group .",
    "we have demonstrated how solution - generating transformations of the einstein equations in the presence of a killing vector may be applied to spacetime holographically dual to hydrodynamics .",
    "our focus has been on the incompressible navier - stokes fluid dual to vacuum rindler spacetime , where we have uncovered a selection of fluid transformations : a linear energy scaling symmetry for solutions with vanishing vorticity ( this constraint may be relaxed to ) , deriving from rg flow of the fluid hypersurface through the bulk , and a @xmath0 group of transformations for fixed viscosity ( boundary ) with explicit examples of reflection - like symmetry in translational and rotational fluid isometries .",
    "these transformations may not be remarkable from the perspective of hydrodynamics but it shows how part of the generalized ehlers transformations can survive holography and give rise to transformations in the fluid dual .",
    "these fluid transformations , when applied to fluid metrics , will produce solution - generating transformations in the vacuum einstein equations . however , the transformed metrics produced directly by our method are not necessarily vacuum . this apparent contradiction may be explained as follows .",
    "it is discussed in @xcite how the electromagnetic field strength contribution to the navier - stokes equations is determined by the projection of the electromagnetic field strength of the bulk spacetime along the unit normal to the hypersurface .",
    "if in the transformed spacetime this projected field strength vanishes , one will still recover the navier - stokes equations ( without forcing terms ) in the dual parameters . in this way , it is not strictly necessary that the fluid metrics be vacuum to recover solution - generating transformations of the unforced incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "one can then be inspired to try the harrison transformation which is a solution - generating transformation in einstein - maxwell theory to give new transformations in magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "a holographic relation of the sort described here has been constructed for magnetohydrodynamics in @xcite .",
    "the harrison transformation in the bulk may then lead to nontrivial transformations in magnetohydrodynamics transforming between fluid velocity and magnetic potentials ; this is the subject of current work .",
    "one can also study the dimensional dependence of these solution - generating transformations . in recent work @xcite , the difference in scaling for turbulence between three and four dimensions",
    "was studied holographically with a large difference in qualitative behaviour .",
    "one could also examine backgrounds associated with nontrivial chemical potential in the dual ; for example rotating or charged black hole backgrounds .",
    "essentially , in this paper we wish to open up the use of gravitational solution generating symmetries in holography .",
    "it is encouraging that this did not immediately fail and one could preserve the fluid metric ansatz with some residual transformations surviving , yet it is intriguing that these transformations did not give anything particularly new . the results for magnetohydrodynamics may prove more significant .",
    "we would like to thank cynthia keeler and andrew strominger for their illuminating and insightful thoughts and comments on the fluid gravity correspondence and shiraz minwalla whose lectures on hydrodynamics at the isaac newton institute programme on m - theory were an inspiration .",
