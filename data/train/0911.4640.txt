    "large - dimension communication systems are likely to play an important role in modern wireless communications , where dimensions can be in space , time , frequency and their combinations .",
    "large dimensions can bring several advantages with respect to the performance of communication systems .",
    "for example , use of large number of transmit / receive antennas increases the number of spatial dimensions , which results in increased capacity @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a severely delay - spread inter - symbol interference ( isi ) channel ( i.e. , large number of echoes of the transmitted signal in time dimension ) , as witnessed in ultrawideband ( uwb ) systems , can provide the opportunity for increased time - diversity @xcite .",
    "harnessing such benefits of large - dimensions in practice , however , is challenging .",
    "in particular , optimum receiver complexity can become practically infeasible in large dimensions .",
    "consequently , low - complexity receiver techniques / algorithms that scale well for large dimensions while achieving near - optimal performance are of interest .",
    "it has been found that many modern meta - heuristic algorithms give near - optimal performance at a much reduced complexity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report one such heuristic based on _ tabu search _ @xcite,@xcite , and illustrate its near - optimal performance in two practically important large dimension systems , namely @xmath0 a ` large - mimo system ' with _ tens of transmit / receive antennas _ ( with a motivation to achieve high spectral efficiencies ) , and @xmath1 a severely delay - spread mimo uwb system with _ tens to hundreds of multipath components _ ( with a motivation to achieve high time - diversity orders )",
    ".    tabu search ( ts ) is a heuristic originally designed to obtain approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "ts is increasingly being applied in communication problems @xcite-@xcite . for e.g. , in @xcite ,",
    "design of constellation label maps to maximize asymptotic coding gain is formulated as a quadratic assignment problem , which is solved using a reactive ts ( rts ) strategy @xcite .",
    "rts approach is shown to be effective in terms of bit error performance and efficient in terms of computational complexity in cdma multiuser detection @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a _ fixed _",
    "ts based detection in v - blast is presented for small number of antennas .",
    "a key objective in this paper is to propose a _",
    "reactive _ tabu search based approach to seek approximately maximum - likelihood ( ml ) solutions in large dimension problems ( but with significantly lower computational complexity than that of the true ml solution ) in linear vector channels ( lvc ) in general , and to establish its performance and complexity in two interesting communication systems in particular .",
    "the first communication system we consider is a large - mimo system that employs tens of transmit antennas to achieve high spectral efficiencies ",
    "e.g. , a @xmath2 v - blast system with 16-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code can achieve a spectral efficiency of 48 bps / hz . we show that the rts algorithm achieves increasingly closer to ml performance for increasing number of transmit antennas ( we refer to this behavior of the algorithm as the ` large - dimension behavior ' ) . for e.g. , in a @xmath3 v - blast system with 4-qam , rts is shown to achieve @xmath4 uncoded ber at an snr of just 0.4 db away from single - input single - output ( siso ) awgn performance .",
    "we present a comparison of the performance and complexity of rts with those of low - complexity variants of sphere decoders ( sd ) , including a suboptimal fixed - complexity sd ( fsd ) reported in @xcite . in a @xmath5 v - blast system with 4-qam",
    ", rts is shown to perform better than fsd by about 1.5 db at @xmath6 uncoded ber .",
    "interestingly , rts achieves this better performance at about an order less complexity than fsd .",
    "we also show that rts can achieve near - ml performance in decoding large non - orthogonal space - time codes ( stbcs ) from cyclic division algebras ( cda ) , which can offer full transmit diversity in addition to achieving full rate as in v - blast @xcite,@xcite .    the second communication scenario considered is equalization in severely delay - spread mimo - isi uwb channels with large number of multipath components ( mpc ) .",
    "communication systems using uwb techniques typically have very high transmission bandwidths to accommodate very high data rates @xcite .",
    "such uwb channels are characterized by severe isi due to large delay spreads @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the number of mpcs in indoor and industrial environments has been observed to be of the order of several tens to hundreds ; number of mpcs ranging from 12 to 120 are common in uwb channel models @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these mpcs , if carefully exploited , can provide the opportunity to achieve increased time - diversity benefits @xcite .",
    "algorithms based on likelihood ascent search ( las)/bit flipping @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and factor graphs @xcite have been proposed for equalization in such systems .",
    "we show that the proposed rts algorithm achieves increasingly close to optimal performance for increasing number of mpcs , and achieves better performance due its inherent escape strategy from local minima .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the proposed rts algorithm for detection in linear vector channels",
    "is presented in section [ sec2 ] .",

    "our interest is to achieve near - ml performance for large @xmath7 at low complexities . in the following subsection",
    ", we present a rts based detection algorithm which is a low - complexity iterative local search algorithm suited well for large @xmath7 .",
    "the rts algorithm starts with an initial solution vector , defines a neighborhood around it ( i.e. , defines a set of neighboring vectors based on a neighborhood criteria ) , and moves to the best vector among the neighboring vectors ( even if the best neighboring vector is worse , in terms of likelihood , than the current solution vector ; this allows the algorithm to escape from local minima ) .",
    "this process is continued for a certain number of iterations , after which the algorithm is terminated and the best among the solution vectors in all the iterations is declared as the final solution vector . in defining the neighborhood of the solution vector in a given iteration ,",
    "the algorithm attempts to avoid cycling by making the moves to solution vectors of the past few iterations as ` tabu ' ( i.e. , prohibits these moves ) , which ensures efficient search of the solution space .",
    "the number of these past iterations is parametrized as the ` tabu period . '",
    "the search is referred to as fixed tabu search if the tabu period is kept constant .",
    "if the tabu period is dynamically changed ( e.g. , increase the tabu period if more repetitions of the solution vectors are observed in the search path ) , then the search is called reactive tabu search .",
    "we consider reactive tabu search in this paper because of its robustness ( choice of a good fixed tabu period can be tedious ) .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the cardinality of @xmath35 .",
    "define a set @xmath36 , @xmath37 } , as a fixed subset of @xmath38 , which we refer to as the _ symbol - neighborhood _ of @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the cardinality of this set to be the same for all @xmath40 ; i.e. , we take @xmath41 . note that the maximum and minimum values of @xmath42 are @xmath43 and 1 , respectively .",

    "let @xmath49 , @xmath50 denote the @xmath51th element in @xmath36 ; i.e. , we say @xmath49 is the @xmath51th symbol - neighbor of @xmath39 .",

    "step 1_.    the algorithm can be stopped based on a fixed number of iterations . though convergence can be slow at low snrs , it can be fast at moderate to high snrs .",
    "so rather than fixing a large number of iterations to stop the algorithm irrespective of the snr , we use an efficient stopping criterion which makes use of the knowledge of the best ml cost found till the current iteration , as follows .",
    "since the ml criterion is to minimize @xmath132 , the minimum value of the objective function @xmath133 is always greater than @xmath134 .",
    "we stop the algorithm when the least ml cost achieved in an iteration is within certain range of the global minimum , which is @xmath134 .",
    "we stop the algorithm in the @xmath53th iteration , only if @xmath135 and the condition @xmath136 is met with at least @xmath137 iterations being completed to make sure the search algorithm has ` settled . '",
    "the bound is gradually relaxed as the number of iterations increase and the algorithm is terminated when @xmath138 in ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are positive constants .",
    "in addition , we terminate the algorithm whenever the number of repetitions of solutions exceeds @xmath141 .",
    "also , the maximum number of iterations is set to @xmath142 .",
    "it is noted that the likelihood ascent search ( las ) algorithm presented in @xcite-@xcite is also a local neighborhood search based algorithm , where the basic definition of neighborhood is the same as in rts .",
    "however , las differs from rts in the following aspects : @xmath0 while the definition of neighborhood is static in las for all iterations , in rts , in addition to the basic neighborhood definition , there is also a dynamic aspect to the neighborhood definition by way of prohibiting certain vectors from being included in the neighbor list ( implemented through repetition checks / tabu period ) , and @xmath1 while las gets trapped in the local minima that it first encounters and declares this minima to be the final solution vector , rts can potentially find better minimas because of the escape strategy embedded in the algorithm ( by way of allowing to pick and move to the best neighbor even if that neighbor has a lesser likelihood than the current solution vector ) .",
    "it is further noted that a general version of las reported in @xcite , termed as multistage las ( mlas ) , executes a different escape mechanism when it encounters a local minima , by changing the neighborhood definition : it considers vectors which differ in two or more coordinates ( as opposed to only one coordinate in the basic neighborhood definition ) as neighbors . on escaping from a local minima",
    ", the algorithm reverts back to the basic neighborhood definition till the next local minima is encountered and stops when no escape from a local minima is possible .",
    "since the performance gain of mlas compared to las is found to be small , we limit our comparison of rts with only las .",
    "our simulation results for the systems considered in sections [ sec3 ] to [ sec5 ] show that rts performs better than las .",
    "consider a v - blast mimo system with @xmath143 transmit and @xmath144 receive antennas . for this system , in the received signal model in ( [ eqn1 ] )",

    "since the rts algorithm is a heuristic , analytical evaluation of the ber and convergence behavior is difficult .",

    "two main observations can be made from fig .",
    "[ fig0x ] : @xmath0 for the system parameters considered , the ber converges ( i.e. , change in ber between successive iterations becomes very small ) for _ max_iter _ greater than 300 , and @xmath1 the converged ber of rts exhibits large - dimension behavior ( i.e. , converged ber improves with increasing @xmath159 ) ; e.g. , the converged ber improves from @xmath160 for @xmath158 v - blast to @xmath161 for @xmath3 v - blast .",

    "figure [ fig2x ] shows the ber performance of rts and las algorithms for @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 v - blast with 4-qam .",
