    "as soon as  @xmath0 approaches  @xmath3 , a flat @xmath0-minimal surface approach a classical , smooth , minimal surface , and this will allow us to keep the lipschitz norm of this approximating graph under control .",
    "then , we perform an estimate on the detachment of this graph from its tangent hyperplane : this bound ( together with a suitable auxiliary function and an estimate relating the integral equation with the classical mean curvature equation in the limit ) provides an alexandrov - bakelman - pucci type theory that controls the oscillation of the graph in measure .",
    "this may be repeated at finer and finer scales via dyadic decomposition , by possibly taking advantage of the closeness to the smooth minimal surface when the size of the cubes become too small . in this way , one obtains a pointwise control on the oscillation of the approximating graph ( and so of the original @xmath0-minimal surface ) , leading to the proof of theorem  [ main ] .    below are the full details or the proof .",
    "one of the difficulties of our framework is that the  @xmath0-minimal surfaces we are dealing with are not necessarily graphs . to get around this problem ,",
    "we follow an idea of  @xcite and we consider level sets of the distance function in an appropriate scaling ( this may be seen as a sup - convolution technique ) .    for this , we recall the following classical geometric observation on the regularity of the level sets of the distance function :    [ cc1l ] let  @xmath59 .",
    "assume that @xmath75 for some  @xmath76 .",
    "let  @xmath77 and  @xmath78",
    ".    then , there exist  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 such that if  @xmath81 then  @xmath82 is a lipschitz graph in the  @xmath27th direction with lipschitz constant bounded by  @xmath83 .    furthermore ,  @xmath84 ( resp . ,  @xmath85 ) may be touched at any point of  @xmath86 by a tangent paraboloid from above ( resp .",
    ", below ) .",
    "we focus on  @xmath84 , the case of  @xmath85 being analogous .",
    "we would like to show that for any  @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath89 from which the desired result follows by possibly exchanging the roles of  @xmath87 and  @xmath90 .",
    "for this , we argue like this . for any  @xmath91 ,",
    "the ball of radius  @xmath92 centered at  @xmath87 is tangent to  @xmath31 at some point  @xmath93 , and , conversely , @xmath94 let  @xmath95 . since  @xmath96 , we have that  @xmath97 must lie in the closure of  @xmath13 .",

    "we point out that the lipschitz bound @xmath83 in lemma [ cc1l ] is optimal , as the example in figure  1 shows .    a global version of lemma  [ cc1l ]",
    "is given by the following result :    [ corcc ] let  @xmath121 .",

    "more precisely , there exists a constant  @xmath133 for which  @xmath134 is a lipschitz graph in the  @xmath27th direction and the lipschitz norm of  @xmath129 is controlled by  @xmath135 , where  @xmath136 is the lipschitz norm of  @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore ,  @xmath84 ( resp .",
    ",  @xmath85 ) may be touched at any point of  @xmath137 by a tangent paraboloid from above ( resp . , below ) .",
    "finally , for any  @xmath138 , @xmath139    since  @xmath122 is  @xmath32 , it separates with power  @xmath140 from its tangent hyperplane , with multiplicative constant  @xmath124 .",
    "then , we take  @xmath141 and we cover  @xmath122 with cylinders  @xmath142 , centered at points of  @xmath143 and rotated parallel to the tangent plane of  @xmath143 .    by construction , in each of these cylinders , @xmath143 separates no more than  @xmath144 from its tangent hyperplane , and so  @xmath13 is  @xmath145-close to such hyperplane .",
    "therefore , lemma  [ cc1l ] applies ( with  @xmath126 there replaced by  @xmath145 ) .",
    "consequently , in each of these cylinders ,  @xmath146 is a lipschitz graph with respect to the normal direction  @xmath57 of  @xmath143 ( and its lipschitz norm is bounded by  @xmath83 with respect to  @xmath57 ) .",

    "then @xmath426    the proof is not simple , but the naive idea is to argue by contradiction , supposing that there is a sequence of  @xmath427 s that oscillate too much .",
    "then one performs the following steps :    * by  @xcite , one gets a sequence  @xmath428 for which  @xmath427 approaches a classical minimal surface  @xmath429 ; * by  , one shadows  @xmath427 with level sets of distance functions  @xmath430 from above and below , and the graphs of @xmath430 are close to  @xmath143 as  @xmath428 ; * since ( by contradiction ) we assumed  @xmath427 to oscillate too much , there are points of  @xmath427 ( and so of the graphs of  @xmath430 ) that stay very close to the bottom and the top of the cylinder of height  @xmath431 ; * accordingly , from the fact that there is a point for which  @xmath432 is close to the bottom , we deduce that  @xmath432 is close to the bottom in a rather large set : for this , one needs to use a dyadic cube argument  when the cubes are reasonably big , one can repeat lemma  [ silv 8.6 ] , and when the cubes get too small one takes advantage of the regularity theory for the classical minimal surface  @xmath429 ; * analogously , from the fact that there is a point for which  @xmath433 is close to the top , we deduce that  @xmath433 is close to the top in a rather large set ; * in particular , we find a point for which  @xmath433 is close to the top and  @xmath432 close to the bottom , that is  @xmath434 is of the order of  @xmath431 ; * this is in contradiction with   and so it completes the proof .",
    "we remark that , in these arguments , there are two uncorrelated scales involved .",
    "one is the flatness of order one ( which , in the course of the proof , will be dominated by a configuration of cylinders whose ratio between the height and the base is some  @xmath435 ) ; the other is the one induced by the criticality ratio for the minimal surfaces flatness condition ( which is some universal  @xmath436 ) . of course , both these configurations are somewhat induced by the trapping of the surface in a strip of small size  @xmath431 .",
    "the interplay between these two scales is what allows us to choose the critical @xmath0 in an independent way , and so to decouple the ratio of the scales involved .",
    "finally , this implies also that as the flatness  @xmath34 of   improves ( while the classical minimal surfaces flatness  @xmath436 is a fixed constant ) , we can apply the decrease of oscillation more and more times , so that in the vertical blow up limit we get a hlder graph , that is harmonic in viscosity sense ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "below is the full detail discussion .",
    "the proof is by contradiction .",

    ". therefore ( see the remark after corollary  17 in  @xcite ) @xmath427 approaches  @xmath429 uniformly in  @xmath445 and then , by theorem  6 in  @xcite , we have that  @xmath429 is a classical minimal surface in  @xmath446",
    ".    we will define  @xmath447 to be the distance between  @xmath427 and  @xmath429 in  @xmath446 : by construction @xmath448 let also @xmath449 and notice that @xmath450 now , we observe that  @xmath451 if  @xmath452 is large enough , and so we can take  @xmath453 such that @xmath454 now , we denote by  @xmath436 the flattening constants of the classical minimal surfaces ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) according to which if a minimal surface is trapped in a cylinder whose ratio between the height and the base is below  @xmath436 , then the minimal surface is a  @xmath32-graph in half the cylinder . by  , and the uniform convergence of  @xmath427 , we see that , for large  @xmath452 ( possibly in dependence of  @xmath436 ) , @xmath455 and so @xmath456 now , we use corollary  [ corcc ] with  @xmath457 and  @xmath458 : for this , we define @xmath459 and we deduce from   and corollary  [ corcc ] that  @xmath460 is @xmath461 also , from  , and  , we have that @xmath462 for any  @xmath463 , as long as  @xmath251 is large enough .",

    "now , we use the following notation : given any  @xmath470 , let  @xmath471 such that  @xmath472 , and let  @xmath473 .",

    "such estimate will be based on a caldern  zygmund type dyadic cube decomposition . according to the different scales involved , we use either a repeated version of lemma  [ silv 8.6 ] or the vicinity of the classical minimal surface  @xmath429 to deduce the necessary rigidity features .",

    "now we take a dyadic cube decomposition of  @xmath511 , with the notation that if  @xmath512 is one of the cubes of the family , its predecessor is denoted by  @xmath513 .",
    "we claim that @xmath514 notice that if   holds , then , by lemma  4.2 of  @xcite ( applied here with  @xmath515 ) and the inductive assumption ( that is , in this case ,   with  @xmath501 ) , we have that @xmath516 this would complete the induction necessary for the proof of  , hence we focus on the proof of  .    for the proof of",

    "if @xmath521 we use lemma  [ silv 8.6 ] . for this scope , given  @xmath522 , we notice that @xmath523 as a consequence , recalling  , @xmath524 with this , we are in position to apply lemma  [ silv 8.6 ] with  @xmath503 , @xmath525 and  @xmath526  notice indeed that   follows from  , follows from   and , recalling  , we see that  @xmath527 which is small if so is  @xmath435 : this configuration is represented in figure  4 .",
    "so , we obtain from   that @xmath528 which is in contradiction with  .",
    "this proves   if   holds true .",

    "also , the ratio between  @xmath534 and  @xmath535 is below  @xmath536 , hence a minimal surface that is trapped inside  @xmath537 is the graph of a function  @xmath538 , with  @xmath539 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath540 keeping this in mind , we take  @xmath251 so large that  @xmath447 , i.e. the distance between  @xmath427 and  @xmath429 is less than  @xmath541 ( recall  ) .",
    "also , for large  @xmath251 , we have that the graph of  @xmath432 is at distance  @xmath542 less than  @xmath543 from  @xmath427 , and so less than  @xmath544 from  @xmath429 ( recall   and  ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath545 is trapped in a slab of width  @xmath546 , and , by  , its boundary contains a point with vertical entry below  @xmath547 .",

    "thanks to lemma  [ ovidiu 6.9 ] , we have obtained a statement analogous to the one of lemma  6.9 of  @xcite , but with uniform estimates .",
