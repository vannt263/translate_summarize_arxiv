    "the notion of trace in the smooth theory , i.e. , in the situation , when the group is trivial , appeared in the works @xcite .",
    "there it was shown , in particular , that the trace of a pseudodifferential operator is a pseudodifferential operator on @xmath1 .",

    "namely , the trace of a @xmath12-operator on a submanifold is an operator localized at a certain submanifold in @xmath1 ( for instance , it can be localized at a point , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the trace is not a pseudodifferential operator and is an operator of fundamentally new nature , for instance , it can be localized at a point(this can happen at the isolated fixed point of the group action ) , and to describe such operators , one needs not only fourier transform ( as for @xmath19do s ) , but also mellin transform .",
    "the present paper is devoted to studying this new class of operators .",
    "the main result is a localization theorem , which describes the set , on which the operator is localized .",
    "this theorem is given in section  [ par3 ] .",
    "in subsequent sections we consider a number of examples , which clarify the situation both from the geometric ( section  [ par4 ] ) and analytic ( section  [ par5 ] ) points of view .",

    "we are also grateful to the referee for useful remarks on a preliminary version of the paper .",
    "as we stressed in the introduction , the trace of a @xmath12-operator @xmath3 on a submanifold @xmath20 is generally localized at a certain subset in @xmath1 . to describe this set , we consider the following two closed subsets in @xmath1 :    1 .",

    "condition  [ cond1 ] is easy to check in examples ( see below ) .",
    "the meaning of this condition is clear : an element @xmath16 takes the neighborhood @xmath29 to a set disjoint with @xmath1 for almost all @xmath30 ( roughly speaking , if an orbit is not contained in @xmath1 , then it is outside of @xmath1 almost everywhere ) .",

    "this enables us without loss of generality to pass to an operator of the form , where the integration is carried out over a small neighborhood of the identity in @xmath12 .",
    "further , we identify this neighborhood with a neighborhood @xmath43 of zero in the lie algebra denoted by @xmath44 . by the assumption ,",

    "the operator acts continuously in the spaces @xmath49 . in particular , it is compact as an operator of order @xmath50 .",
    "the idea of the proof is that integration along @xmath47 is an integration in a transverse direction to @xmath1 , and , when we perform it , there disappears _ one _ of the @xmath51-functions , which enter in the coboundary operator , hence , we get the summand @xmath52 in the formula given above .",
