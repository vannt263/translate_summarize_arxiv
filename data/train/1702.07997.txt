    "the relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc , together with the lattice monte - carlo simulations , allow us quantitative studies of the phase diagram at high temperature and low baryon density .",
    "there the qcd phase transition is known to be a crossover in which a hadronic matter continuously transforms into a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "then it also raises a question on the nature of hadron - quark phase transitions at low temperature and high baryon density .",
    "the questions addressed in this talk are : ( i ) what is the nature of hadron - quark matter phase transitions ?",
    "( ii ) how does the gluon dynamics change as density increases ?",
    "( iii ) what kind of many - body correlations emerge at high baryon density ?",
    "we try to get some hints to answer these questions by studying equations of state which are nowadays strongly constrained by neutron star observations @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite , and qcd calculations at low @xcite and high @xcite density limits .",
    "there are theoretical guides from qcd calculations . at low density , realistic nuclear potentials , combined with the sophisticated many - body calculations @xcite , are able to explain the properties of light nuclei and nuclear matter in good accuracy . at @xmath3 , however , there arise a number of conceptual questions such as the convergence of many - body forces , hyperon softening problem , and the possibility of the structural changes in hadrons . the validity of hadronic calculations should be understood from microscopic treatments of qcd dynamics .    at high density ,",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations have been carried out to 3-loop order @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the expansion works at quark chemical potential @xmath4 larger than @xmath5 or at baryon density @xmath6 , while at lower density the results show the large renormalization scale dependence , indicating that soft gluons are important and the matter is strongly correlated .",
    "the domain @xmath7 is hard to explore directly from qcd calculations , but neutron star observations provide us with considerable information . in principle , if the @xmath8-@xmath9 relation for neutron stars are established , one can use it to directly reconstruct equations of state @xcite .",
    "such direct conversion is not possible at present , but the current data can already impose significant constraints on possible equations of state .",
    "practically it is very useful to note that the shapes of mass - radius ( @xmath10 ) curves are roughly determined by the pressure at several fiducial densities @xcite ( fig.[mr ] , left ) .",
    "the overall radii of typical neutron stars are determined by the pressure at @xmath11 , and softer ( stiffer ) equations of state give smaller ( larger ) radii .",
    "the recent trend obtained from the ( suggestive ) estimates of neutron star radii with @xmath12 for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : solar mass ) @xcite indicates soft equations of state at @xmath11 , and this is consistent with heavy ion data @xcite , nuclear symmetry energy @xcite , and recent advance quantum monte - carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "further constraints will be obtained if the gravitational waves from neutron star mergers are discovered @xcite . with equations of state at @xmath3 , the @xmath10 curves start to rise almost vertically and the slopes are determined by pressure for @xmath15 .",
    "then the curves reach their maximal masses whose values strongly correlate with equations of state at @xmath16 .",
    "the existence of @xmath17 stars play significant roles here : it requires that equations of state at @xmath16 must be very stiff , and many model equations of state were already rejected by this condition @xcite .",
    "the softness at low density and stiffness at high density together give significant constraints on possible equations of state for @xmath15 .",
    "in general , such soft - to - stiff behaviors require the increase of pressure for finite energy interval , but such increase must be sufficiently slow in order to keep the causality constraint , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ( adiabatic ) speed of sound and @xmath20 is the light velocity .",
    "the restriction becomes even severer if we have the strong first order phase transition in the intermediate region ; because of the softening associated with first order phase transitions , after the transitions we must introduce rapid stiffening within small energy density interval to get the connection with stiff high density equations of state . for these reasons , we are inclined to think that the intermediate region does not have strong first phase transitions , and low and high density matter are connected by smooth crossover or weak first order transitions turns out to be very stiff , then we can still allow strong first order phase transitions @xcite . ] .",
    "these theoretical and observational constraints bring us to the 3-window description of dense matter @xcite : ( i ) at @xmath21 , the matter is dilute and nucleons exchange only few mesons so that baryons and mesons are well - defined objects .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath22 , baryons start to exchange many mesons ( or quarks ) and many - body forces become increasingly important . with many quark exchanges",
    "the identity of a hadron becomes ambiguous .",
    "( iii ) at @xmath16 , baryons overlap and quarks begin to develop the quark fermi sea , forming a quark matter .",
    "nevertheless the matter is supposed to be strongly coupled according to the pqcd calculations .",
    "we construct equations of state based on this picture ( fig.[mr ] , right ) . at @xmath23",
    ", we use akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall ( apr ) equation of state . ] as a representative of nuclear equations of state @xcite . for @xmath24",
    ", we use a schematic quark model for @xmath24 leaving the in - medium coupling constants as free parameters .",
    "the @xmath17 constraint limits the range of the effective couplings and from which we delineate the properties of dense matter @xcite .",
    "the most difficult is the modeling of matter at @xmath25 , where neither purely hadronic nor quark matter descriptions are reliable .",
    "thus we construct the equations of state by interpolating the apr and quark model pressure and applying thermodynamic and causality constraints .",
    "this patchwork study apparently has a lot of freedoms , but actually the recent constraints are so tight that one can derive useful insights into the qcd phase diagram .",
    "based on the crossover picture , we assume the adiabatic continuity in which the structure of effective interactions are smoothly connected from low to high density .",
    "we use the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite with effective interactions inspired from hadron and nuclear physics , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are gell - mann matrices for flavors and colors respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath29 is the standard njl model which is responsible for the descriptions of chiral symmetry breaking / restoration and the changes in quark bases .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath30 is responsible for the confining forces that trap three quarks into a baryon .",
    "this term should be crucial at low density but we will drop it off by restricting the use of our model to the quark matter domain .",
    "the third term expresses the color magnetic interaction which is responsible for the @xmath31 splitting and the color super conductivity at high density .",
    "the last term is the repulsive density interaction which is inspired from the repulsive @xmath32-meson exchange in nuclear physics .",
    "the _ in - medium coupling constants _ , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , at @xmath35 are treated as free parameters while we fix the scalar coupling constant @xmath36 in @xmath29 to the vacuum value but we found that @xmath36 at @xmath37 should be as large as its vacuum value to avoid strong first order phase transitions . ] , @xmath38 . we note that the effective interactions summarize the microscopic processes of quarks and gluons in a concise way , and their importance is reflected in the values of @xmath39 .",
    "if the matter is weakly coupled and gluons become perturbative , the equations of state should be like an ideal gas so that @xmath39 should be much smaller than the vacuum values . instead",
    ", our model analyses suggest that the effective couplings at @xmath16 should be comparable to the vacuum value to pass the @xmath17 constraint .",
    "in short , we use @xmath40 to stiffen equations of state , which in turn requires @xmath41 for the smooth connection to the apr equation of state at @xmath42 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , more elaborated treatments of the running @xmath34 were performed .",
    "this picture is actually consistent with our implicit assumption on the qcd vacuum energy . for instance suppose that the matter at @xmath43 becomes weakly coupled and perturbative .",
    "then the resulting pressure must consist of perturbative contributions _ plus a constant term _",
    ", @xmath44 ( bag constant ) , that reflects the difference between the perturbative and non - perturbative vacua .",
    "the size of such bag constant is naively given by the qcd scale @xmath45 , comparable to the energy density at the core of neutron stars .",
    "if such large bag constant would appear , it would reduce the pressure by @xmath44 while increase the energy density by @xmath44 , causing the significant softening in the equations of state .",
    "thus we expect that the gluons remain non - perturbative and do not produce significant bag constant at @xmath43 .    in summary , we delineate properties of qcd matter by studying the equations of state supposed from theoretical and empirical constraints .",
    "it seems to us that the crossover phase transition together with adiabatic continuity from hadronic to quark sectors offer a consistent description of qcd matter .",
    "gluons seem non - perturbative even after the quark matter formation .",
    "such regime has been studied in the context of quarkyonic matter in which one takes the large @xmath46 limit to keep gluons in medium as non - perturbative as in the qcd vacuum @xcite . at finite @xmath46 , the description of gluons in neutron star densities is a highly nonlinear problem ; it strongly depends on how strongly quarks near the fermi surface fluctuate , but the nature of such fluctuations is very sensitive to the condensed phases in consideration @xcite .",
    "the effects of the condensates appear in the excitation modes @xcite and the resulting thermal equations of state .",
    "the future detection of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers will provide us with such information , with which we should be able to discriminate various phase structures and test theoretical scenarios .",
