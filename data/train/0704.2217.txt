    "magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence seems to be a major physical process to generate and maintain the magnetic fields observed in most of the structures of the universe @xcite . when addressing the problem of the generation of large scale magnetic fields by small scale turbulent flows , a model known as mean field dynamo ( mfd )",
    "is usually considered @xcite . despite its simplicity and lack of broad applicability",
    ", it proved to be a very useful tool in studying qualitatively conceptual issues of large scale magnetic field generation .",
    "the mechanism is based on decomposing the fields into large scale , or mean fields , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and small scale , turbulent ones @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 . these small scale fields have very small coherence length , but their intensities can be higher than the one of the mean fields . in this mechanism the evolution equation for @xmath4 is written @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ohmic resistivity and @xmath12 the turbulent electromotive force ( t.e.m.f . ) .",
    "denote volume averages , i.e. , quantities that can depend only on time . ]",
    "the term @xmath13 is usually disregarded in the studies of mfd as the focus of most of them is to understand the generation of large scale quantities due to small scale effects .",
    "if homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is considered , the t.e.m.f can be written as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 , @xmath17 being a correlation time @xcite .",
    "the dependencies on @xmath18 and @xmath7 are due to the back - reaction of those induced fields on the dynamo @xcite . in the kinematically driven dynamo considered here , the features of the generated fields crucially depend on the helicity of the flows : helical flows are at the base of the mechanisms to generate large scale fields , while non - helical flows would only produce small scale fields .",
    "this separation , however , is somewhat artificial , as small scale fields are also produced by helical turbulence @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to address an issue not ( or very seldom ) considered in the literature up to now , namely , the induction of large scale flows @xmath0 , also named shear flows , by the small scale turbulent fields , and how these induced flows back - react on the turbulent electromotive force @xmath19 of a mfd .",
    "on one side , we mean that the expression @xmath20 would be valid only during the time interval in which @xmath21 ; and on the other , even if this conditions is satisfied , @xmath22 could be affected by the generation of @xmath0 and consequently its functional form should be modified to incorporate this effect .",
    "the generation of magnetic fields due to the action of these large scale velocity flows instead of by @xmath22 was recently addressed analytically by several authors @xcite , and was also studied numerically by @xcite and semi - analytically by @xcite . however , none of those works addressed specifically the issue we want to analyze here .",
    "we work in the framework of the two scale approximation , that consists in assuming that mean fields peak at a scale @xmath23 while turbulent ones do so at @xmath24 , and also consider homogenous and isotropic turbulence .",
    "although this kind of turbulence is of dubious validity when dealing with large scale fields , it serves well for initial , qualitative studies of the sought effects .",
    "another assumption we shall make is that @xmath4 is force - free , i.e. , of maximal current helicity .",
    "although fields with this feature can be observed in certain astrophysical environments , they are not a generality , and also they are not seen in some numerical simulations .",
    "the main reason to use them here is to simplify the ( heavy ) mathematics , while maintaining a physically meaning scenario .    in order to find @xmath22 when lorentz force acts on the plasma",
    ", we must solve a differential equation that contains terms with one point triple correlations , i.e. , averages of products of three stochastic fields evaluated at the same point .",
    "this means that instead of dealing with only one equation to solve for @xmath22 , we have to solve a hierarchy of them . in order to break this hierarchy and",
    "thus simplify the mathematical treatment of the problem we must choose a _ closure prescription _ , which consists in writing the high order correlations as functions of the lower order ones , but maintaining the physical features of the problem under study . in mhd the intensity of the non - linearities",
    "is measured by the magnetic reynolds number , which is defined from the induction equation for the magnetic field , @xmath25 , as @xmath26 , where now @xmath27 is a characteristic velocity of the plasma , @xmath28 is a characteristic length and @xmath11 is the ohmic resistivity .",
    "thus for @xmath29 the non - linear terms can be neglected in front of the resistive ones , and therefore the equations become linear , while for @xmath30 the resistive terms should be dropped off in front of the non - linear ones .",
    "the intermediate regime is more difficult to analyze . in this paper",
    "we shall consider @xmath31 , i.e. , the non - linearities must be maintained , and consequently a closure scheme must be selected to deal with them .",
    "we choose to work with the so called minimal @xmath32 approximation @xcite , whereby the triple moments in the equation for @xmath22 will be considered as proportional to quadratic moments , and written in the form @xmath33 , with the proportionality factor @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a relaxation time that can in principle be scale , and/or @xmath36 , dependent .",
    "the validity of this closure was checked numerically @xcite for low reynolds numbers , and was also verified for the case of passive scalar diffusion .",
    "we shall assume that it is also valid for all the triple correlations that may appear throughout this work .",
    "we consider boundary conditions such that all total divergencies vanish .",
    "these conditions may be a bit unrealistic for astrophysical systems , but they have two advantages : magnetic helicity becomes a gauge - invariant quantity @xcite , and the obtained results can be compared with numerical simulation , as to perform them it is customary to use those conditions .",
    "we consider fully helical , prescribed , @xmath6 fields .",
    "our starting points are the evolution equations for @xmath37 and for the magnetic helicities @xmath38 , as the evolution of these quantities is tightly interlinked @xcite in the absence of shear flows . when including @xmath39 new terms appear in the equation for @xmath40 , but the ones that drive the evolution of @xmath40 in absence of @xmath0 , i.e. , the @xmath41 and @xmath2 terms @xcite , are not explicitly modified . for those new terms ,",
    "further equations must be derived , that in turn show the subtleties of the interplay among @xmath42 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 . due to the chosen boundary conditions ,",
    "the evolution equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 do not explicitly depend on @xmath0 , they will do so implicitly through @xmath22 .",
    "we consider fully helical @xmath0 fields , so we study their growth through its associated kinetic helicity , @xmath45 and show that , for fully helical , prescribed @xmath46 , large scale flows will be always generated , as long as small scale lorentz force is not null , i.e. , if @xmath47 . we shall consider two values for the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and for each case analyze the effect of short and large @xmath35 .",
    "in general we find that for short @xmath35 ( large @xmath50 ) , i.e. , strong non - linearities , the effect of large scale flow is negligible , thus producing results that practically do not differ from the ones in the absence of large scale flows . for large @xmath35 (",
    "small @xmath51 ) the general effect is an enhancement of the electromotive force and the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity , this enhancement being stronger for @xmath52 than for @xmath48 .",
    "ohm s law for an electrically conducting fluid reads @xmath53 , with @xmath11 the electric resistivity and @xmath54 the electric current . the equation for @xmath55 is the induction equation :    @xmath56    and from @xmath57 we have    @xmath58    which is an evolution equation for @xmath59 .",
    "the equation for the velocity field @xmath60 is the navier - stokes equation that , when considering only lorentz force , reads    @xmath61    with @xmath62 the kinetic viscosity . to work within mean field theory @xcite",
    "we decompose the different fields as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where any mean value of stochastic quantities vanishes .",
    "the derivation of the evolution equations for the mean and stochastic fields is a standard procedure , already described in the literature @xcite .",
    "consequently we only write here the results . assuming incompressibility of the large and small scale flows , considering that @xmath4 is force free and working with coulomb gauge for the vector potential , i.e. , @xmath68",
    ", we obtain the following equations for the mean fields @xmath69 , \\label{g}\\ ] ] @xmath70 -\\eta \\mathbf{\\nabla } \\times \\overline{\\mathbf{b } } ,   \\label{h3}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the t.e.m.f . , and @xmath72 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\nu \\nabla ^{2}\\overline{\\mathbf{u}}.   \\label{i2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 is the projector that selects the subspace of solutions of eq .",

    "( [ i2 ] ) shows that a large scale velocity field can be induced from an initially zero value , as long as @xmath74 .",

    "this last quantity is defined as the average over the entire volume of the dot product @xmath78 @xcite . in this way",
    ", we write the magnetic helicity associated to the large and small scale fields respectively as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and by definition they can only depend on time . the evolution equations for @xmath43 and @xmath81 , for the chosen boundary conditions , read @xcite @xmath82and @xmath83observe that these equations have the same form as the ones obtained in the absence of large scale flows .",
    "this fact is due to the selected boundary conditions : magnetic helicity can be injected into the system through the boundaries by large scale flows .",
    "thus , in the case under consideration here , these flows can not explicitly transport magnetic helicity between the different scales , they will act implicitly through @xmath37 .    from the definition of @xmath22 given above , the evolution equation for the t.e.m.f .",
    "is @xmath84 .",
    "proceeding in a similar form as in refs .",

    "observe that the presence of @xmath0 adds two new terms to the equation for @xmath22 but does not explicitly modify the ones found in the absence of those flows .",
    "the influence of @xmath39 on the terms proportional to @xmath4 will be through the dependence of those terms with the magnetic helicities ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to gain conceptual clearness",
    "we shall make further physical hypotheses on our systems , that will also help to simplify the mathematics .",
    "one of them is to consider that large scale flows @xmath0 are fully helical .",
    "this is consistent with the concept of mean field dynamo and with the chosen boundary conditions . therefore to track the evolution of the large scale velocity flow",
    ", we shall study its associated kinetic helicity , defined as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the vorticity .",
    "the derivation of the equation for @xmath89 is explained in the appendix , and the result is @xmath90where the semi - equality is due to the fact that we are approximating volume average by a local spatial average .",
    "it is well known that kinetic helicity is not conserved in mhd @xcite , so eq . ( [ t ] ) is not an essentially new result .",
    "however it serves to our purposes in showing that large scale helical flows can be induced by turbulent @xmath7-fields , provided they are not force - free . at this point",
    "we make another supposition : we take @xmath91 which , besides being consistent with the chosen boundary conditions , means that the induction of large scale magnetic fields maximal for @xmath92 ( cf .",
    "observe that by imposing coulomb gauge on eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) we obtain a further constraint on the mean fields , namely @xmath93 , and the fact that we consider it equal to zero allows us to replace @xmath94 .",
    "as was advanced in the introduction , we shall work within the two scale approximation , whereby mean fields are supposed to peak at a scale @xmath95 , and stochastic ones at @xmath24 .",
    "we begin by noting that eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) together with the definition of the t.e.m.f . and",
    "( [ t ] ) , are very complicated , involving new functions of the mean and stochastic fields for which further equations must be deduced . from the constraint on @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath4 derived from @xmath96 , and the fact that we are considering @xmath97 as force - free , we can write @xmath98 , where the last semi - equality stems from the fact that @xmath4 is considered to be force - free . from eqs .",
    "( [ n ] ) and ( [ p ] ) , we see that the dot product of @xmath22 with @xmath99 is responsible for magnetic helicity transport .",
    "let us write @xmath100 .",
    "its evolution equation is @xmath101 . proceeding similarly as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the following full form for the evolution equation for @xmath102 , in the two scale approximation : @xmath103 \\left\\vert h_{l}^{m}\\right\\vert \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{2}{3}k_{l}^{2}e^{u}h_{l}^{m } -\\zeta _ { 1}\\overline{\\mathcal{e}}^{\\overline{b } } ,   \\label{es - a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we replaced @xmath104 , the large scale cross - helicity ; @xmath105 , the small scale cross - helicity ; @xmath106 ; @xmath107 and @xmath108 where these two last quantities are considered prescribed .",
    "since we are considering @xmath109 to be force - free , we replaced @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ es - a ] ) , @xmath112 , includes the effect of viscosity , resistivity , the term @xmath113 and , more importantly , the three point correlations denoted by @xmath114 in eq . ( [ r ] ) .",
    "we see that besides the equations derived until now we need the ones for @xmath115 .",
    "the derivation of these equations is sketched in the appendix and , although being a straightforward procedure , it is a rather tedious one and we end up with a system of seven equations , besides the four ones already shown above : the two equations for @xmath116 , the ones for @xmath117 , i.e. , the dot product of the small scale lorentz force with @xmath4 , for @xmath118 , for @xmath119 , for @xmath120 , i.e. , the scalar product of the t.e.m.f . with the large scale vorticity , and for @xmath121 ,",

    "although this condition can be fulfilled in certain astrophysical environments , this is not a general situation , therefore it should be dropped off in future works that aim at generalizing this work .",
    "we found that large scale flows act on the t.e.m.f . @xmath37 through large and small scale cross - helicities , and that , for the minimal @xmath32 closure considered here , the effect of those fields is stronger for large relaxation times ( @xmath208 ) . for short relaxation time ( @xmath185 ) , the effect of those fields seems to be negligible .",
    "the choice of the values for @xmath178 was arbitrary , in the sense that , to our present knowledge , it is not known how that parameter depends on the magnetic reynolds number for @xmath209 .",
    "for @xmath179 it seems to be confirmed that @xmath178 is of order unity .",
    "here we chose to work with two values that may be considered as representative of two extreme possibilities : @xmath185 would be consistent with the predictions of the numerical simulations ( although they were made for a different @xmath36 interval ) , while @xmath210 would represent a resistive case . in any case",
    ", more reliable values should be given by numerical simulations performed for @xmath211 .",
    "due to the simple system considered and the approximations we made , we do not intended to find quantitative results , as for example estimate the time interval during which @xmath212 is valid , nor do we extract more conceptual and qualitative conclusions .",
    "we end this work stressing the importance of studying this problem via numerical simulations , that will show us the next paths to follow in a further analytical study , besides confirming or contesting the results presented here .",
