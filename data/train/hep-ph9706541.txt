    "the formalism has been successfully applied to large transverse momentum processes @xcite .",
    "interestingly , inclusive production cross sections for charmonium at low energies , dominated by low transverse momenta , also seem to have a good phenomenological description in terms of this approach @xcite . the remaining phenomenological problem is to explain the @xmath17 ratio observed in hadro - production .",
    "@xmath18 are first produced at order @xmath19 , whereas @xmath9 begins only at order @xmath20 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that a better understanding of this ratio may require higher order terms in @xmath21 and @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    "the nrqcd series was evaluated to order @xmath20 . in the dominant gluon fusion channel a previously missed term at order @xmath22",
    "was found for @xmath18 and up to eleven terms at order @xmath20 were obtained for all @xmath23 states .    in this paper",
    "we extend the computations of @xcite to polarisation asymmetries , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the helicities of the beam and target respectively , and @xmath27 is the cross section for fixed initial helicities .",
    "this allows us to formulate several tests of nrqcd and the velocity scaling rules that it yields .",

    "the nrqcd factorisation formula for the inclusive production of heavy quarkonium resonances @xmath29 with 4-momentum @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a flux factor .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are computable in perturbative qcd and hence have an expansion in the strong coupling @xmath21 ( evaluated at the nrqcd cutoff ) . although the matrix element is non - perturbative , it has a fixed scaling dimension in the quark velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the fermion bilinear operators @xmath35 are built out of heavy quark fields sandwiching colour and spin matrices and the covariant derivative @xmath36 . the composite labels @xmath37 and @xmath38 include the colour index @xmath39 , the spin quantum number @xmath40 , the number of derivative operators @xmath41 , the orbital angular momentum @xmath42 ( found by coupling the derivatives ) , the total angular momentum @xmath43 and the helicity @xmath44 . when the final state spin is unobserved , the hadron projection operator @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 denotes hadron states with energy less than the nrqcd cutoff ) , is diagonal in these quantum numbers .",

    "we evaluate the polarised cross sections to order @xmath20 . the taylor expansion order , @xmath61 is obtained by setting @xmath62 and @xmath63 in eq .

    "at low @xmath86 the asymmetry is dominated by the asymmetry in the gluon densities . however , at @xmath86 of a few hundred gev , the gluon asymmetry reduces to about 0.001 , and the neglected @xmath98 channel becomes important .",
    "these terms appear with the opposite sign and reduce the asymmetry even further . as a consequence , we expect the @xmath7 asymmetry to be small for all @xmath86 @xmath255 any attempt to see structure in this asymmetry would probably require unreasonably large statistics .",
    "the @xmath6 asymmetry seems to be enormously complicated because of the feed - down from radiative decays of the @xmath23 states .",

    "thus the asymmetry comes entirely from the 2040% of the cross section due to @xmath23 decays . taking into account the ratios of the production cross sections of @xmath23 and the branching fractions for their decays into @xmath6 , we find that the @xmath9 and @xmath219 states contribute equally to @xmath6 . hence the @xmath6 polarisation asymmetry",

    "alternative points of view can be taken about the scaling of the non - perturbative matrix elements .",

    "since the dimension 4 terms @xmath261 appear in the @xmath23 cross sections at order @xmath262 , they dominate the cross section . heavy quark spin symmetry then gives the @xmath17 ratio to be @xmath263 , in agreement with the pion - nucleon observations .",
    "the same @xmath17 ratio is then predicted for charm and bottom mesons in hadro- and photo - production , and the result remains stable even when higher order terms are introduced .",
    "the rearrangement of the series also leads to @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "the consequences for the asymmetries are @xmath266 and totally different from the nrqcd results summarized in eqs .",

    "these give somewhat different results .",
    "the asymmetries for @xmath4 and @xmath267 are independent of such assumptions , and hence form good measures of polarised gluon densities .    in conclusion ,",
