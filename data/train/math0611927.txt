    "then @xmath18 and @xmath19 are homeomorphic 4-manifolds ( with @xmath20 ) , having as boundary the brieskorn sphere @xmath21 however , they are not diffeomorphic : this can be shown using the donaldson or seiberg - witten invariants ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but also by comparing the hat heegaard floer invariants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cobordisms from @xmath26 to @xmath27 obtained by deleting a @xmath11-ball from @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . indeed , the arguments of fintushel - stern @xcite and szab - stipsicz @xcite can be easily adapted to show that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have different hat heegaard floer invariants ; one needs to use the computation of @xmath28 due to ozsvth - szab @xcite , and the rational blow - down formula of roberts @xcite .",
    "( it is worth noting that the maps @xmath29 give no nontrivial information for closed 4-manifolds , cf .",
    "@xcite ; exotic structures on those can be detected with the mixed heegaard floer invariants of @xcite . )",
    "the original definitions of the vector spaces @xmath30 and the maps @xmath29 involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of riemann surfaces ; the riemann surfaces are related to the three - manifolds and cobordisms involved via heegaard diagrams . in @xcite , sarkar and the third author showed that every three - manifold admits a heegaard diagram that is nice in the following sense : the curves split the diagram into elementary domains , all but one of which are bigons or rectangles . using such a diagram , holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially , and the result is a combinatorial description of @xmath31 for any @xmath32 as well as of the hat version of heegaard floer homology of null homologous knots and links in any three - manifold @xmath1 . a similar result was obtained in @xcite for all versions of the heegaard floer homology of knots and links in the three - sphere .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps @xmath33 when @xmath24 is a cobordism between @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the property that the induced maps @xmath34 and @xmath35 are surjective .",
    "note that this case includes all cobordisms for which @xmath36 is torsion , as well as all those consisting of only 2-handle additions .",
    "roughly , the computation of the ranks of @xmath33 goes as follows .",
    "the cobordism @xmath24 is decomposed into a sequence of one - handle additions , two - handle additions , and three - handle additions . using the homological hypotheses on the cobordism and the @xmath37-action on the heegaard floer groups we reduce the problem to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to two - handle additions only . then , given a cobordism made of two - handles , we show that it can be represented by a multi - pointed triple heegaard diagram of a special form , in which all elementary domains that do not contain basepoints are bigons , triangles , or rectangles . in such diagrams",
    "all holomorphic triangles of maslov index zero can be counted algorithmically , thus giving a combinatorial description of the map on @xmath38    we remark that in order to turn @xmath30 into a fully combinatorial tqft ( at least for cobordisms satisfying our hypothesis ) , one ingredient is missing : naturality .",
    "given two different nice diagrams for a three - manifold , the results of @xcite show that the resulting groups @xmath30 are isomorphic .",

    "we then turn to the description of the map induced by two - handle additions .",
    "for the sake of clarity , in section  [ sec : two ] we explain in detail the case of adding a single two - handle : we show that its addition can be represented by a nice triple heegaard diagram with a single basepoint and , therefore , the induced map on @xmath30 admits a combinatorial description .",
    "we then explain how to modify the arguments to work in the case of several two - handle additions .",
    "this modification uses triple heegaard diagrams with several basepoints . in section  [ sec : last ] , we discuss the additions of one- and three - handles , and put the various steps together . finally , in section  [ sec : example ] we present the example of @xmath41 surgery on the trefoil .    throughout the paper",

    "since the image of @xmath146 is unpunctured and positive , we have @xmath168 by , we get @xmath169    this means that at least one component of @xmath124 is topologically a disk .",

    "the finger moves successfully kill the badness of all regions other than @xmath316 in which we keep the basepoint @xmath288 the result is a nice triple heegaard diagram for the cobordism @xmath24 .",
    "we now explain how the arguments in this section can be extended to a cobordism @xmath24 which consists of the addition of several two - handles .",
    "we view @xmath24 as surgery along a link @xmath335 of @xmath231 components .",

    "each of the two sets of curves ( @xmath268 and @xmath338 ) has @xmath339 elements .",
    "applying the algorithm in @xcite we can make this diagram nice , i.e. such that all regions not containing one of the @xmath297 s are either bigons or rectangles . for @xmath340",

    "we then add twin gamma curves as in step 2 of section  [ sec : boss ] .",
    "for this we need to do several isotopies of the beta curves as in figure  [ fig : adding_gamma_curve_after ] . in that figure , if the region on the top left is @xmath345 the one on the right might be @xmath346 for @xmath347 ; however , the isotopy can be done as before .",
    "next , we stabilize the heegaard diagram @xmath231 times ( once for each link component ) to obtain a triple diagram for the cobordism , as in step 3 of section  [ sec : boss ] .",
    "we then do the analogue of step 4 by pushing @xmath231 fingers to kill the badness of the regions of type @xmath348 .",
    "since the fingers only pass through rectangles , they do not intersect each other .",
    "the only change is that in figures  [ fig : dprime_ds_bad ] and [ fig : dprime_ds_nice ] , the region on the very right may contain a different puncture @xmath59 than the one on the left . by contrast , in case 2 of step 4 , the region on the right in figure  [ fig : dprime_bigon ] contains the same puncture as the region on the left , since they lie in the same connected component of the complement of the beta circles .    at the end of step 4 , the beta curves split the heegaard surface into @xmath231 connected components @xmath349 .",
    "we then do the analogue of step 5 in section  [ sec : boss ] .",
    "note that this step ( except for the very last bit , figure  [ fig : dw2_special_bad_region ] ) only involves moving gamma curves through alpha curves .",

    "therefore , we can perform the moves in this step once for each connected component of @xmath232 , independently of each other , because the moves take place in the corresponding component @xmath350 in the situation considered in figure  [ fig : dw2_special_bad_region ] , the gamma curves cross a beta curve ; however , the special region @xmath321 is part of a unique @xmath351 , so we can perform the isotopy of the gamma curves as before , without interference from another @xmath352    finally , for step 6 , note that in all the previous steps we have not destroyed the property that the projection of @xmath232 to the heegaard surface is embedded . more precisely , in the part of the stabilized heegaard diagram shown in figure  [ fig : stabilization ] , we take a component of the link projection to be a loop starting in @xmath310 , near the upper foot of the handle , going down along @xmath307 until it reaches @xmath313 , then going inside @xmath313 until it reaches the intersection of @xmath308 and @xmath353 and then going along a sub - arc of @xmath308 to its original departure .",
    "these paths remain embedded , and disjoint from each other , throughout steps 4 and 5 .",
    "( indeed , neither @xmath305 nor this sub - arc of @xmath308 is moved during these steps . )",
    "it then suffices to note the finger moves in step 6 take place in a neighborhood of the projection of the corresponding link component ( the path considered above ) .",
