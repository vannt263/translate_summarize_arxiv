    "since half a century ago the idea of effective interactions has been strongly pursued after the pioneering works by goldstone  @xcite , moshinsky  @xcite and skyrme  @xcite .",
    "they suggested to use this notion to cut down the complexity of the nuclear many body problem due to strong short range repulsion which arises when nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions are probed at sufficiently high energies .",
    "effective interactions were profitably exploited in the mid 70 s  @xcite and have reached a high degree of sophistication ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a very recent compilation of parameters is given in ref .",
    "@xcite displaying a huge diversity , somewhat reflecting the disparate phenomena which are used to fix the effective hamiltonian , but remarkably exhibiting no link to the fundamental two - body interaction . in a recent work  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) a model independent and implicit way of determining the effective interactions from nn low energy scattering data has been suggested .",
    "they depend on the minimal de broglie wavelength between nucleons in a finite nucleus , a trend consistent with fitting coarse grained nn interactions  @xcite to fixed upper center of mass ( cm ) momenta  @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "there has been an intense reformulation of the nuclear many body problem inspired by the wilsonian renormalization group ideas providing an alternative approach to the determination of effective interactions  @xcite ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and their characterization as finite cut - off counterterms  @xcite .",
    "this framework takes advantage of the proper momentum scale resolution or cut - off @xmath1 , separating explicitly what degrees of freedom and interactions behave dynamically below that scale . the requirement",
    "that observables should be cut - off independent determines the implicit @xmath1 dependence of the effective interaction . a direct and explicit way to achieve such interaction uses the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) method with a block - diagonal generator whence an effective hermitean phase - equivalent interaction",
    "is derived  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyse the block - diagonal similarity renormalization group ( bd - srg ) scheme  @xcite as applied to the two body problem .",
    "this allows to implement by a continuous and unitary evolution in a momentum - dimension auxiliary parameter @xmath2 , referred to as the srg - cutoff , a block - diagonal separation of the hilbert space in two orthogonal ( decoupled ) subspaces @xmath3 which are below or above @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the evolution runs from @xmath4 ( the ultraviolet limit ) to @xmath5 ( the infrared limit ) and interpolates between a _ bare _",
    "hamiltonian , @xmath6 , and the block - diagonal one @xmath7 in a unitary way @xmath8 .",
    "this is the unitary implementation  @xcite to all energies of the previously proposed @xmath9-approach  @xcite where the higher energy states are missing , and in practice a free theory was assumed above the energy determined by the momentum cut - off @xmath1 , hence generating a truncation error . for the rest of the paper we will refer to this @xmath1 as the @xmath9-cutoff to be identified with the block - diagonal srg one .",
    "we emphasize that a complete hilbert space separation corresponds to the limit @xmath10 .",
    "although this block - diagonal scheme solves the problem as a matter of principle , srg equations are differential equations in the srg - cut - off @xmath2 for unbound operators defined on the hilbert space , and they have only been solved exactly for simple cases  @xcite . for most cases however , srg equations must be numerically posed on a finite @xmath11dimensional momentum grid , @xmath12 , and the differential equations require a further grid in the srg - cut - off @xmath13 which introduces two infrared resolution scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the bd - srg equations @xmath1",
    "takes values on the momentum grid @xmath12 .",
    "the interplay among these scales makes the limit @xmath16 numerically stiff and computationally expensive .",
    "we will show that this infrared behaviour is best reproduced by directly using low energy scattering data in the continuum and , most remarkably , that effective interactions are accurately determined this way in a wide cut - off range .",
    "we review briefly the renormalization problem for the two - nucleon system from a wilsonian point of view to introduce our notation in a way that our results can be easily stated ( see e.g. ref .",

    "( [ eq : k - mom - bare ] ) we get @xmath26 the idea is that by using this truncation one can work in a smaller space , without explicit reference to high energy states .",
    "this does not provide a unique definition of the effective interaction , so an auxiliary condition must be specified . in the original @xmath27 approach",
    "@xcite the half - off shell t - matrix was fixed to the bare one , a procedure which did not guarantee a self - adjoint operator , and hence a subsequent hermitization procedure was required . in the bd - srg approach",
    "@xcite the hermiticity is preserved along the srg evolution .",

    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "while the effective interaction idea is very appealing there is no unique way to define it ; its definition depends on _ how _ are the high and low energies separated and _ what _ is the relevant energy scale cut - off . within a given scheme ,",
    "however , the cut - off scale dependence of effective interactions representing a given bare interaction in a model space can be carried out in two complementary ways : either explicitly from a block - diagonal srg transformation or implicitly by using scattering data and renormalization conditions .",
    "although the complementarity of both explicit and implicit views of the renormalization procedure is often invoked on general grounds , we note that it is seldomly tested within the present context of nuclear effective interactions .",
    "as we have shown such a test requires to pin down the numerics in a finite momentum grid with sufficient accuracy making the explicit bd - srg method computationally expensive and impractical . at low energies",
    "effective interactions and their scale dependence are just given by counterterms evaluated for finite cut - offs .",
    "we find a remarkably wide range of cut - offs where this complementarity holds in a model independent way .",
    "this suggests that the implicit renormalization approach may be a simpler , more accurate and direct method to determine the effective interaction than the explicit and traditional method based on numerically integrating the operator srg flow equations using as initial condition a phenomenological bare interaction fitted to nn scattering data below pion production threshold .",
