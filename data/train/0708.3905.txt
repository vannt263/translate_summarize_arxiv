    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion in the standard model .",
    "its mass is at the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale . due to its large mass",
    "its weak decay time is much shorter than the typical time for the strong interactions to affect its spin @xcite .",
    "therefore the information on its polarization , is not disturbed by hadronization effects but transferred to the decay products . within the standard model ,",
    "the dominant decay of the top quark is @xmath7 .",
    "the angular distributions of the top quark decay products are determined by the momentum and spin state of the top quark itself .",
    "it is believed that top quark physics will be crucial to understand the structure of standard model and existence of new physics beyond .",
    "detailed discussions on top quark spin polarization properties will contribute future researches on this subject .    in this work",
    "we investigate top quark spin polarization along the direction of various spin bases for the single production in @xmath8 collision via the process @xmath9 .",
    "the research and development on linear @xmath3 colliders have been progressing and the physics potential of these future machines is under study .",
    "after linear colliders are constructed its operating modes of @xmath0 and @xmath10 are expected to be designed @xcite .",
    "real gamma beam is obtained through compton backscattering of laser light off linear electron beam where most of the photons are produced at the high energy region .",
    "the luminosities for @xmath0 and @xmath10 collisions turn out to be of the same order as the one for @xmath3 @xcite , so the cross sections for photoproduction processes with real photons are considerably larger than virtual photon case . in our calculations",
    "we consider three different center of mass energies @xmath2=0.5 , 1 and 1.5 tev of the parental linear @xmath3 collider .",
    "there are many detailed discussions in the literature for single top quark production and spin correlations in @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath6 collisions @xcite . at @xmath5 and @xmath11 colliders",
    "top quarks are produced @xmath12 and single t production modes . in double production case ,",
    "spin up top quark and spin down anti - top quark are more likely produced and there are observable angular correlations among the decay products .",
    "@xmath13 decay products in the final states give larger statistics than the single production case . on the other hand , final state in the single top case",
    "is relatively simple and may compensate for the smaller statistics @xcite . in @xmath6 collisions , top quark decay products in the final states are dominated by the single top production due to absence of the @xmath12 production . since single top production contains an electroweak process with produced top quarks coupled to a w boson , decay products of the final top quark gives a high angular correlation @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in the @xmath8 collision .",
    "moreover linear @xmath3 collider or its @xmath0 mode provide a clean environment to study polarization phenomena of top quarks .",
    "in @xmath3 linear colliders a hard photon beam can be produced by compton backscattering of laser light off linear electron or positron beam .",
    "we consider the case in which the photon beam is obtained by compton backscattering off linear electron beam and the positron beam directly takes part in the subprocess .",
    "the spectrum of the backscattered photons is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath15    with @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the energy of initial laser photon and @xmath18 is the energy of initial electron beam before compton backscattering .",
    "@xmath19 is the fraction which represents the ratio between the scattered photon and initial electron energy for the backscattered photons moving along the initial electron direction .",
    "maximum value of @xmath19 reaches 0.83 when @xmath20 in which the backscattered photon energy is maximized without spoiling the luminosity .",
    "the integrated cross section over the backscattered photon spectrum is given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the square of the center of mass energy of the subprocess @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath23 is related to @xmath24 , the square of the center of mass energy of @xmath3 by @xmath25 .",
    "the single production of top quark via the process @xmath1 is described by four tree level diagrams .",
    "each of the diagrams contains wtb vertex and due to its v - a structure , produced top quarks are highly polarized . because of its large mass the helicity of a top quark is frame dependent and changes under a boost from one frame to an other .",
    "the helicity and chirality states do not coincide with each other and there is no reason to believe that the helicity basis will give the best description of the spin of top quarks . so it is reasonable to study other spin bases better than helicity for top quark spin .",
    "the spin four - vector of a top quark is defined by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 in the top quark rest frame .",
    "the laboratory frame is the @xmath3 center of mass system where the cross section is performed .",
    "we consider four different top spin direction in the laboratory frame ; the incoming positron beam , photon beam directions and outgoing @xmath28 direction and also the helicity basis .",
    "@xmath29 should be obtained by a lorentz boost from laboratory frame :    @xmath30    here @xmath31 is the momentum of the particle moves along the top spin direction in the laboratory frame and @xmath32 is the momentum observed in the rest frame of the top quark .    in table",
    "i - iii polarized cross sections , dominant spin fractions and spin asymmetries are given for the various top quark spin bases .",
    "it is shown from these tables that @xmath4-beam direction gives the highest degree of polarization ; @xmath33 at @xmath34 tev , @xmath35 at @xmath36 tev and @xmath37 at @xmath38 tev .",
    "its energy dependence is significant . in relatively low energies",
    ", helicity will not give the best description of the spin of a massive fermion like top quark .",
    "therefore other spin bases may give a better description of top quark spin .",
    "in our case favorite spin basis is the @xmath4-beam spin decomposition axis .",
    "when energy increases top quark gradually becomes ultrarelativistic and spin fraction in the helicity basis grows .",
    "this behaviour is shown from table i - iii .",
    "spin fraction for the helicity basis increases with energy ; @xmath39 at @xmath34 tev , @xmath40 at @xmath36 tev and @xmath41 at @xmath38 tev . at the energy region",
    "we have considered speed of the top quarks are not ultrarelativistic therefore helicity is not the favorite spin basis .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain similar results for anti top quarks with the process @xmath42 . in this case",
    "favorite spin basis is the @xmath43-beam spin decomposition axis .",
    "same results at table i - iii for the spin fractions are obtained with the interchange of the bases ; @xmath4-beam @xmath44 @xmath43-beam , @xmath28-beam @xmath44 @xmath45-beam .",
    "but the spin orientations should be reversed ; spin up @xmath44 spin down , l @xmath44 r.    another useful quantity about spin - induced angular correlations is the spin asymmetry    @xmath46    here subscript up arrow @xmath47 ( down arrow @xmath48 ) stands for spin up @xmath49 ( spin down @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 represents number of event for the corresponding spin .",
    "the angular distribution of the top quark decay involves correlations between top decay products and top quark spin :    @xmath52    here the dominant decay chain of the top quark in the standard model @xmath53 is considered .",
    "@xmath54 is defined as the angle between top quark decay products and the top quark spin quantization axis in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "@xmath55 is the correlation coefficient and @xmath56 for @xmath57 or @xmath58 which leads to the strongest correlation .",
    "one can see from table i that @xmath4-beam basis improves the asymmetry a factor of 4.35 when compared to helicity basis at @xmath34 tev . from table ii and iii",
    "we see that this factor takes the value of 2.38 and 1.85 respectively .    in order to get an idea about the influence of spin polarization on transverse momentum @xmath59 distributions of singly produced top quarks",
    "we plot fig i - iii .",
    "similar features in the tables are reflected in the figures also ; deviations of the @xmath59 distributions from the unpolarized ( total ) is the largest for helicity basis .    in our calculations",
    "phase space integrations have been performed by grace @xcite which uses a monte carlo routine .",
    "we have shown that in the energy region @xmath60 tev @xmath4-beam direction provides a high degree of polarization .",
    "considerable improvements have been obtained in the spin fractions and asymmetries with respect to helicity basis .",
    "therefore a detailed analysis of top spin polarization and studying various spin bases in the @xmath8 collision is important and may contribute future researches .",
    "linear @xmath3 collider and its @xmath0 mode provide a clean environment and the experimental clearness is an advantage of @xmath0 collisions with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath6 collisions . at hadron",
    "colliders the interacting particles are not the beam particles themselves .",
    "the reactions are initiated by one of many partons present in the incident hadron . so the energy and quantum state of the initial state are not fixed . on the other hand lepton colliders",
    "tend have much cleaner beams and lower backgrounds .",
