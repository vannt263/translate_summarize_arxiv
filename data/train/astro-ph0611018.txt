    "recent progress both in numerical simulations and observations has improved physical modeling of galaxy clusters beyond a simple isothermal and spherical approximation for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications ; departure from isothermal distribution was discussed in the context of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , an empirical @xmath0-model profile has been replaced by that based on the nfw dark matter density profile @xcite , non - spherical effects of dark halos have been considered fairly extensively @xcite , and the physical model for the origin of the triaxial density profile has been proposed @xcite .    despite an extensive list of the previous studies , no physical model has been proposed for the statistical nature of underlying inhomogeneities in the intra - cluster medium ( icm , hereafter ) . given the high spatial resolutions achieved both in observations and simulations , such a modeling should play a vital role in improving our understanding of galaxy clusters , which we will attempt to do in this paper .",
    "temperature of the icm is one of the most important quantities that characterize the cluster . in x - ray observations , the spectroscopic temperature , @xmath1 ,",
    "is estimated by fitting the thermal continuum and the emission lines of the spectrum . in the presence of inhomogeneities in the icm ,",
    "the temperature so measured is inevitably an _ averaged _ quantity over a finite sky area and the line - of - sight .",
    "it has been conventionally assumed that @xmath1 is approximately equal to the emission - weighted temperature : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gas number density , @xmath4 is the gas temperature , and @xmath5 is the cooling function .",
    "@xcite , however , have pointed out that @xmath1 is systematically lower than @xmath6 .",
    "the authors have proposed an alternative definition for the average , _ spectroscopic - like temperature _ , as @xmath7 they find that @xmath8 with @xmath9 reproduces @xmath1 within a few percent for simulated clusters hotter than a few kev , assuming chandra or xmm - newton detector response functions .",
    "@xcite performed a more systematic study of the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 using a sample of clusters from sph simulations and concluded that @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite provided a useful numerical routine to compute @xmath8 down to icm temperatures of @xmath11 kev with an arbitrary metallicity .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath6 is not directly observable , although it is easily obtained from simulations .    the above bias in the cluster temperature should be properly taken into account when confronting observational data with theory , for example , in cosmological studies . as noted by @xcite",
    ", it can result in the offset in the mass - temperature relation of galaxy clusters .",
    "@xcite have studied its impact on the estimation of the mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath12mpc , @xmath13 .",
    "the authors perform the statistical analysis using the latest x - ray cluster sample and find that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the systematic difference of @xmath16 can thus shift @xmath13 by @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to explore the origin of the bias in the spectroscopic temperature by studying in detail the nature of inhomogeneities in the icm .",
    "we investigate both the large - scale gradient and the small - scale variations of the gas density and temperature based on the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "having found that the small - scale density and temperature fluctuations approximately follow the log - normal distributions , we construct an analytical model for the local icm inhomogeneities that can simultaneously explain the systematic bias .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe our simulation data ,",
    "construct the mock spectra and compare quantitatively the spectroscopic temperature with the emission - weighted temperature and the spectroscopic - like temperature suggested by @xcite . in  3",
    ", we propose an analytical model for the inhomogeneities in the icm . in  4 , we test our model against the result of the simulation . finally , we summarize our conclusions in  5 . throughout the paper ,",
    "temperatures are measured in units of kev .",
    "the results presented in this paper have been obtained by using the final output of the smoothing particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulation of the local universe performed by @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions were similar to those adopted by @xcite in their study ( based on a pure n - body simulation ) of structure formation in the local universe .",
    "the simulation assumes the spatially ",
    "flat @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5 cdm ) universe with a present matter density parameter @xmath18 , a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath19 , an rms density fluctuation amplitude @xmath20 and a baryon density parameter @xmath21 . both the number of dark matter and sph particles are @xmath22 million within the high - resolution sphere of radius @xmath23 mpc which is embedded in a periodic box of @xmath24 mpc on a side , filled with nearly 7 million low - resolution dark matter particles .",
    "the simulation is designed to reproduce the matter distribution of the local universe by adopting the initial conditions based on the _ iras _ galaxy distribution smoothed on a scale of 7 mpc .",
    "the run has been carried out with gadget-2 @xcite , a new version of the parallel tree - sph simulation code gadget @xcite .",
    "the code uses an entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite , and allows a treatment of radiative cooling , heating by a uv background , and star formation and feedback processes .",
    "the latter is based on a sub - resolution model for the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium @xcite ; in short , each sph particle is assumed to represent a two - phase fluid consisting of cold clouds and ambient hot gas .",
    "the code also follows the pattern of metal production from the past history of cosmic star formation @xcite .",
    "this is done by computing the contributions from both type - ii and type - ia supernovae and energy feedback and metals are released gradually in time , accordingly to the appropriate lifetimes of the different stellar populations .",
    "this treatment also includes in a self - consistent way the dependence of the gas cooling on the local metallicity .",
    "the feedback scheme assumes a salpeter imf @xcite and its parameters have been fixed to get a wind velocity of @xmath25 @xmath26 . in a typical massive cluster the sne ( ii and ia ) add to the icm as feedback @xmath27 kev per particle in an hubble time ( assuming a cosmological mixture of h and he ) ; @xmath28 per cent of this energy goes into winds .",
    "a more detailed discussion of cluster properties and metal distribution within the icm as resulting in simulations including the metal enrichment feedback scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "the simulation provides the metallicities of the six different species for each sph particle .",
    "given the fact that the major question that we addressed is not the accurate estimate of @xmath1 or @xmath8 , but the systematic difference between the two , we decided to avoid the unnecessary complication and simply to assume the constant metallicity .",
    "therefore we adopt a constant metallicity of 0.3 @xmath29 in constructing mock spectra below , and the mekal ( not vmekal ) model for the spectral fitting .",
    "the gravitational force resolution ( i.e. the comoving softening length ) of the simulations has been fixed to be 14 kpc ( plummer - equivalent ) , which is comparable to the inter - particle separation reached by the sph particles in the dense centers of our simulated galaxy clusters .      among the most massive clusters formed within the simulation we extracted six mock galaxy clusters , contrived to resemble a3627 , hydra , perseus , virgo , coma , and centaurus , respectively",
    ". table [ tab : all ] lists the observed and simulated values of the total mass and the radius of these clusters . in order to specify the degree of the bias in our simulated clusters , we create the mock spectra and compute @xmath1 in the following manner .",
    "first , we extract a @xmath30 cubic region around the center of a simulated cluster and divide it into @xmath31 cells so that the size of each cell is approximately equal to the gravitational softening length mentioned above .",
    "the center of each cluster is assigned so that the center of a sphere with radius @xmath32 equals to the center of mass of dark matter and baryon within the sphere .    the gas density and temperature of each mesh point ( labeled by @xmath33 )",
    "are calculated using the sph particles as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the position of the mesh point , @xmath36 denotes the smoothing kernel , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the mass associated with the hot phase , position , smoothing length , temperature , and density associated with the hot gas phase of the @xmath42-th sph particle , respectively .",
    "we adopt the smoothing kernel : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "it should be noted that the current implementation of the sph simulation results in a small fraction of sph particles that have unphysical temperatures and densities .",
    "this is shown in the temperature  density scatter plot of figure [ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the red points correspond to sph particles that should be sufficiently cooled , but not here because of the limited resolution of the simulation .",
    "thus if they satisfy the jean criterion , they should be regarded as simply cold clumps without retaining the hot gas nature ; see figure 1 and section 2.1 of @xcite . in contrast , the blue points represent the sph particles that have experienced the cooling catastrophe , and have significantly high cold gas fraction ( larger than 10 percent ) . in either case , they are not supposed to contribute the x - ray emission .",
    "thus we remove their spurious contribution to the x - ray emission and the temperature estimate of icm .",
    "specifically we follow @xcite , and exclude particles ( red points ) with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the critical density , and particles ( blue points ) with more than ten percent mass fraction of the cold phase . while the total mass of the excluded particles is very small ( @xmath48 ) , they occupy a specific region in the @xmath49-@xmath4 plane and leave some spurious signal due to high density , in particular for blue points .",
    "second , we compute the photon flux @xmath50 from the mesh points within the radius @xmath51 from the cluster center as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the redshift of the simulated cluster , @xmath54 is the metallicity ( we adopt 0.3 @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 is the hydrogen mass fraction , @xmath57 is the proton mass and @xmath58 is the emissivity assuming collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "we calculate @xmath58 using spex 2.0 .",
    "the term @xmath59 represents the galactic extinction ; @xmath60 is the column density of hydrogen and @xmath61 is the absorption cross section of @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the effect due to the spectrum distortion , not statistical error , we adopt a long exposure time as the total photon counts @xmath62 500,000 . in this paper",
    ", we consider mock observations using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , thus we neglect a peculiar velocity of the cluster and a turbulent velocity in icm because of insufficient energy resolution of _ chandra _ acis - s3 and _ xmm - newton _ mos1 detector .    finally , the mock observed spectra are created by xspec version 12.0 .",
    "we consider three cases for the detector response corresponding to 1 ) perfect response , 2 ) _ chandra _ acis - s3 , and 3 ) _ xmm - newton _ mos1 . in the first case",
    ", we also assume no galactic extinction ( @xmath63 ) and refer to it as an `` ideal '' case . in the second and third cases , we adopt an observed value to @xmath60 listed in table [ tab : all ] and redistribute the photon counts of the detector channel according to rmf ( redistribution matrix file ) of acis - s3 and mos1 using the _ rejection method_.    figure [ fig : exam_spec ] illustrates the mock spectra of `` virgo '' and `` perseus '' using rmf of acis - s3 . unless stated otherwise , we fit the spectra by an absorbed single - temperature mekal model in the energy band 0.5 - 10.0 kev .",
    "we define the spectroscopic temperature , @xmath1 , as the best - fit temperature provided by this procedure . since the spatial resolution of the current simulations is not sufficient to fully resolve the cooling central regions , a single - temperature model yields a reasonable fit to the mock spectra . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the spectra for a single temperature corresponding to the `` emission weighted '' value of the mesh points within @xmath51 : @xmath64 we calculate the cooling function @xmath65 using spex 2.0 assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , the energy range of 0.5 - 10.0 kev , and the metallicity @xmath66 .",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath67 is clearly distinguishable on the spectral basis in the current detectors .",
    "figure [ fig : tsl - tspec ] shows the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath6 for our sample of simulated clusters .",
    "it is well represented by a linear relation @xmath68 with the fitted values of @xmath69 ( ideal ) , @xmath70 ( acis ) and @xmath71 ( mos ) , respectively . in the range of temperatures corresponding to rich clusters ,",
    "the spectroscopic temperature @xmath1 is systematically lower than @xmath6 by @xmath72 % .",
    "we note that the above bias should depend on the energy band in which @xmath1 is evaluated . in order to demonstrate it quantitatively",
    ", we also list in table [ tab : all ] the fitted values of @xmath1 from the 0.1 - 2.4 kev and 2.0 - 10.0 kev data , respectively .",
    "because the exponential tail of the thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum from hotter components has negligible contribution in the softer band , the bias tends to increase and decrease in the softer and harder bands , respectively .      in order to better approximate @xmath1 ,",
    "@xcite proposed a `` spectroscopic - like temperature '' ; they found that equation ( [ eq : def_tsl ] ) with @xmath9 reproduces @xmath1 in the 0.5 - 10.0 kev band within a few percent . throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath9 when we estimate the spectroscopic - like temperature quantitatively . in figure",

    ", we hereafter use @xmath74 to represent @xmath1 , and express the bias in the spectroscopic temperature by @xmath75 table [ tab : all ] provides @xmath76 ( mesh - wise ) for the six simulated clusters .",
    "the range of @xmath76 ( mesh - wise ) is approximately 0.8 - 0.9 .",
    "while @xmath76 is systematically lower than unity , the value is somewhat higher than the results of @xcite , @xmath77 .",
    "this is likely due to the different physics incorporated in the simulations and the difference in how @xmath8 and @xmath6 are computed from the simulation outputs .",
    "the major difference of the physics is the amplitude of the wind velocity employed ; @xcite used have a feedback with weaker wind of @xmath78 , while our current simulations adopt a higher value of @xmath79 .",
    "because weaker wind can not remove small cold blobs effectively , the value of @xmath80 of @xcite is expected to be larger .    to show the difference of the temperature computation scheme explicitly , we also list in table [ tab : all ] the values of @xmath81 ( particle - wise ) computed in the `` particle - wise '' definitions used in @xcite : @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ,",
    "the emission - weighted and spectroscopic - like temperatures defined in equation ( [ eq : p - tew ] ) and equation ( [ eq : p - tsl ] ) are sensitive to a small number of cold ( and dense ) sph particles present , while their contribution is negligible in the mesh - wise definitions , equation ( [ eq : tmesh ] ) and equation ( [ eq : tslmesh ] ) . as in @xcite",
    ", we have removed the sph particles below a threshold temperature @xmath84 kev to compute @xmath76 ( particle - wise ) .",

    "having quantified the bias in the temperature of simulated clusters , we investigate its physical origin in greater detail . since clusters in general exhibit inhomogeneities over various scales , we begin with segregating the large - scale gradient and the small - scale fluctuations of the gas density and temperature .    for the large - scale gradient",

    "we have explored the origin of the bias in the spectroscopic temperature of simulated galaxy clusters discovered by @xcite .",
    "using the independent simulations data , we have constructed mock spectra of clusters , and confirmed their results ; the spectroscopic temperature is systematically lower than the emission - weighted temperature by 10 - 20% and that the spectroscopic - like temperature defined by equation ( [ eq : def_tsl ] ) approximates the spectroscopic temperature to better than @xmath167 6% . in doing so",
    ", we have found that the multi - phase nature of the intra - cluster medium is ascribed to the two major contributions , the radial density and temperature gradients and the local inhomogeneities around the profiles .",
    "more importantly , we have shown for the first time that the probability distribution functions of the local inhomogeneities approximately follow the log - normal distribution .",
    "based on a simple analytical model , we have exhibited that not only the radial profiles but also the local inhomogeneities are largely responsible for the above mentioned bias of cluster temperatures .",
    "we would like to note that the log - normal probability distribution functions for density fields show up in a variety of astrophysical / cosmological problems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it is not clear if they share any simple physical principle behind , it is interesting to attempt to look for the possible underlying connection .    in this paper ,",
    "we have focused on the difference between spectroscopic ( or spectroscopic - like ) and emission - weighted temperatures , which has the closest relevance to the x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "another useful quantity is the mass - weighted temperature defined by @xmath168 this is related to the cluster mass more directly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass - weighted temperature is highly sensitive to the radial density and temperature profiles , while it is little affected by the local inhomogeneities .",
    "though challenging , it will be `` observable '' either by high - resolution x - ray spectroscopic observations @xcite or by a combination of the lower resolution x - ray spectroscopy and the sunyaev - zeldovich imaging observations @xcite .",
    "we will discuss usefulness of this quantity and the implications for the future observations in the next paper .",

    "we also thank the referee , stefano borgani , for several pertinent comments on the earlier manuscript .",
