    "recently , the lhcb collaboration has reported the observation of the decay @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the interest in this decay is related to the possible existence of the exotic glueball state decaying into the @xmath0 pair @xcite .",
    "the spin - parity quantum numbers of the resonance states decaying into @xmath0 are reported to be @xmath11 , and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has also reported the observation of four resonance structures in the decay @xmath13 , in the mass range 4140  4700 mev , decaying into @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this group of resonances is widely discussed because of their possible exotic nature @xcite , side by side with the explanations based on the dynamical rescattering effects @xcite .",
    "two of them , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , have masses in the range 4100  4350 mev attained in the @xmath1 mass spectrum in the decay @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the preferable spin - parity quantum numbers of these resonances are @xmath6 @xcite .    the data of ref .",
    "@xcite were plotted against the phase space distribution which was shown to be inadequate because the resonance bumps were seen in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass spectra @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to write down the amplitudes and the mass spectra of the above final states in the decay @xmath2 upon taking into account possible intermediate resonance states in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , irrespective of the model assumptions about their nature .",
    "the task of obtaining the effective amplitudes is greatly simplified when one takes into account the near - threshold kinematics of the decay @xmath2 .",
    "then one can neglect the higher partial waves in the decay amplitudes .",
    "the expressions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass spectra obtained under such an approximation upon taking into account the intermediate resonances @xmath16 and @xmath17 are used to extract from the fits the masses and coupling constants of these resonances .",
    "it should be emphasized that the presentation of the results in terms of coupling constants is more informative than the popular representation in terms of the partial widths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains the expressions for the lowest momenta effective vertices of the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 transitions assuming @xmath3 for the @xmath20 resonances and @xmath6 for the @xmath21 ones .",
    "the partial decay widths @xmath16 and @xmath22 are given there .",
    "section  [ amps ] is devoted to the derivation of the @xmath2 decay amplitudes upon taking into account the @xmath9 mixing due to the common @xmath0 decay channel , and @xmath10 mixing due to the @xmath1 one .",
    "the modulus squared of the @xmath2 decay amplitude and the expressions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass spectra are calculated in sec .",
    "[ spectra ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , these expression are applied to the description of the lhcb data @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] contains the brief discussion of the obtained results .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] serves as a conclusion .",
    "some details used in the derivation of expressions in the main text are given in the appendices .",
    "we assume the existence of the resonances at @xmath23 and 2.2 gev in the @xmath0 mass spectrum which will be called as @xmath20 , and the resonances @xmath14 and @xmath15 with masses in the range 4100  4350 mev , in the @xmath1 mass spectrum @xcite which will be called @xmath21 .",
    "one needs the effective vertices @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . since all particles in the final state of the decay @xmath28 have unit spin , the number of effective contributions to the decay amplitude is frighteningly large , especially when taking into account the fact that space parity is not conserved because the @xmath29 meson decays due to the weak interactions , so that only the angular momentum conservation , not the space parity , restricts the number of possible lorenz structures in the effective decay amplitudes .",
    "the couplings of @xmath30 with @xmath0 and @xmath31 with @xmath1 are considered to be due to the strong interactions , hence they conserve parity , but again the unit spin admits many independent effective contributions . the situation can be greatly simplified if one takes into account the fact that the kinematics of the decay @xmath32 is such that all particles in the final state have relatively low momenta . indeed , the invariant mass of the @xmath0 pair varies in the range @xmath33 that is , @xmath34 gev .",
    "the maximum momentum of the @xmath35 is reached when the final @xmath36 meson is at rest while two @xmath35 mesons move in opposite directions , and this gives @xmath37 .",
    "analogously , the invariant mass of the @xmath1 state varies in the range @xmath38 that is , @xmath39 gev",
    ". the maximum momentum of the @xmath36 meson is reached when one of the @xmath35 mesons is at rest , while other moves oppositely to @xmath36 resulting in @xmath40 .",
    "however , these relatively small ratios are not in fact reached because the above kinematic situations taking place at the border of phase space are suppressed by the final state phase space factors .",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ s12 ] ) and ( [ s23 ] ) below .",
    "this permits one to take into account only the effective decay vertices with the lowest nonvanishing powers of momenta .",
    "let us start with the parity - conserving effective vertices of @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the required lowest momenta @xmath25 vertices for various quantum numbers are @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the polarization tensor of the spin two resonance , @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for the polarization four - vector and four - momentum of the @xmath45 meson , and @xmath46 is the totally antisymmetric unit levy - civit tensor .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances are now established : @xmath47 @xcite . then the effective lowest momentum @xmath27 vertex looks like @xmath48 in the above expressions , @xmath49 , @xmath50 stand for the polarization four - vectors of the @xmath31 , @xmath36 mesons , respectively , and @xmath51 is the four - momentum of the @xmath31 resonance .",
    "the justification of this expression is given in the appendix [ b ] .",
    "all effective vertices are assumed to be real , and the possible dependence on the momentum squared is neglected .",
    "let us give the effective amplitudes for the weak decays of the @xmath29 meson .",
    "the lowest momenta amplitudes of the transitions @xmath24 for different quantum numbers of the resonance @xmath30 are @xmath52where @xmath53 .",
    "note that , in the first expression in eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) , the amplitude conserves ( breaks ) the space parity in the case of @xmath30 with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , respectively . the expression of the decay amplitude to the tensor resonance in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ br ] ) breaks parity .",
    "the parity - conserving amplitude is @xmath56 , hence it has the @xmath57 wave form to be neglected side by side with the parity - breaking @xmath57 wave expression @xmath58 .",
    "the lowest momentum @xmath26 transition amplitude , @xmath59 breaks space parity .",
    "our goal here is to take into account the energy dependence of the partial widths of the resonances involved , as well as their mixing due to the common decay modes ( if any ) .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg ) gives the @xmath0 , @xmath60 decay modes for the tensor @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 resonances and the @xmath64 one for the @xmath63 resonance @xcite .",
    "again , because of the low statistics of the available data we will take into account only the @xmath0 decay mode relevant in the context of the data presented in ref .",
    "the same assumption will be adopted for the scalar and pseudoscalar ones observed by the besiii collaboration @xcite .",
    "the standard calculation gives the partial decay widths for the resonances with the given quantum numbers .",
    "taking into account only the lowest nonvanishing momenta , one gets , using the effective vertices eq .",
    "( [ rvert ] ) , the following expressions : @xmath65hereafter , @xmath66is the standard klln function .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath67 partial width calculated from eq .",
    "( [ xvert ] ) is @xmath68 in what follows , the @xmath2 decay amplitudes to be derived below will include only the resonance contribution with specific @xmath69 . by this reason , all resonances @xmath30 with different quantum numbers",
    "will be labeled by the single letter @xmath30 in the coupling constants , without pointing to the @xmath69 quantum numbers .",
    "according to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , let us represent the @xmath2 decay amplitude as the sum of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 resonance contributions , @xmath70    the diagrams of the decay @xmath2.,width=302 ]    the lhcb data @xcite visibly demonstrate the appearance of two enhancements in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mass spectra .",
    "so , it will be assumed in what follows that there are two resonances @xmath4 , @xmath5 with the spin zero and ( or ) spin two in the @xmath0 system mass range from 2.0 to 2.4 gev @xcite and two resonances @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath6 in the @xmath1 system mass range from 4.14 to 4.35 gev @xcite .",
    "their masses are close , and the resonances have common decay modes like @xmath0 in the case of @xmath20 or @xmath1 in the case of @xmath21 .",
    "they can mix inside each group . using refs .",
    "@xcite we take into account the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing by introducing the nondiagonal polarization operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "then the simplest breit - wigner resonance contribution in the case of , say , @xmath20 , @xmath73 should be generalized to include the effects of energy dependent widths and mixing by means of introducing the amplitude @xmath74 with amputated kinematic factors ( to be included below ) .",
    "taking into account the effect of resonance mixing in general case is outlined in appendix [ b ] by eq .",

    "( [ rwidth ] ) , and the nondiagonal polarization operator which includes the common @xmath0 mode is @xmath79 analogously , the mixing of @xmath31 resonances is taken into account by introducing the amplitude with amputated kinematical factors :    @xmath80    the inverse propagator of the @xmath81 resonances ( @xmath77 ) that appears in eq .",

    "( [ xwidth ] ) . equations ( [ gr12 ] ) and ( [ gx12 ] )",
    "reduce to the simple sum of two breit - wigner contributions in the case of vanishing mixing @xmath85 .",
    "the explicit alternative expression for the mixing amplitude valid in the case of the two resonances mixed via the single common decay channel is given by eq .",
    "( [ gpart ] ) in appendix [ b ] .    as for the eqs .",
    "( [ dri ] ) and ( [ pir12 ] ) , their imaginary parts originated from the @xmath0 loop contribution are fixed by the unitarity relation .",
    "the real parts are divergent when calculated from the dispersion relation upon neglecting the vertex form factors , @xmath86 in the case of @xmath55 and @xmath12 , when restricting to the @xmath87-wave approximation , the divergence is logarithmic and can be regularized by the subtraction at the resonance mass .",
    "however , there is the @xmath57 wave contribution neglected in eq .",
    "( [ rwidth ] ) which makes the divergence much stronger , and there are no model independent ways to fix the subtraction constants .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath88 wave decay of the @xmath54 resonance .",
    "alternatively , one may insert the vertex form factors to make the loop integrations finite , but this again requires the fixing of additional free parameters characterizing the above form factors .",
    "the same refers to the @xmath31 resonances whose decay width contains the @xmath57-wave contribution essential in the dispersion integral at large momenta .    in practice",
    ", one can adopt the following way of action . in the present case ,",
    "there are no sharp energy dependencies of the loop effects like those observed in the case of the difference of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 loop contributions @xcite .",
    "the decay kinematics is such that it involves relatively narrow intervals of the invariant masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ m12 ] ) and ( [ m13 ] ) .",
    "hence , one can ignore the possible dependence on energy of the really incalculable smooth real parts of the loop contributions and take them as constants . in the case of the diagonal polarization operators ,",
    "the constants are absorbed in the masses of the resonances @xmath91 , while in the nondiagonal one , @xmath92 , it is included as the free parameter @xmath93 , all these to be determined from the fit .    after these remarks , one can write the contribution of the mixed resonances in the @xmath0 state .",
