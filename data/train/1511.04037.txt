    "the low single pass absorption needs to be compensated by plasmonic or nanophotonic absorption enhancement exploiting strong field enhancement and coupling to guided modes .",
    "while optical simulations have been instrumental in the design and optimization of light - trapping and absorber structures , electrical simulations of these ultra - thin photovoltaic devices have received little attention so far .",
    "this might be related to the apparent simplicity of the device structure , which in the past has never made it necessary to go beyond the conventional drift - diffusion model for bulk materials .",
    "however , it is not obvious that an absorber as thin as a few tens of nanometers and correspondingly large built - in fields should still behave as homogeneous bulk .",

    "conventionally , the radiative rate is related to the charge carrier densities as follows @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the intrinsic carrier density , is the absorption coefficient and @xmath20 is the black - body radiation flux .    for the solution of the above system of differential equations , boundary conditions need to be specified .",

    "v , as computed from the negf for a ballistic system and including electron - phonon interaction , respectively.[fig : absem_ball_phon],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the second source of discrepancies is the spatial variation of the generation and recombination rates within the device , especially close to the contacts ( fig .",

    "this is due to the treatment of minority carrier contacts in the negf formalism , enforcing nodes in the charge carrier density at those contacts . to investigate the impact of deviations in the rate on the overall device characteristics , the negf rates for generation and recombination are directly used in the semi - classical balance equations - .",
    "while @xmath43 is able to handle external generation files , the recombination rate needs to be engineered via the emission coefficient , using relation : the emission coefficient @xmath79 is adjusted such that expression with the semi - classical charge carrier densities reproduces the negf emission rate .",
    "the result displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : jv_all ] ( open squares ) reveals a perfect agreement with the full quantum kinetic simulation .",
    "this means that , for the situation under consideration , where transport is mediated by states that are still rather extended , the use of a semi - classical drift - diffusion model for charge carrier transport is valid . at the same time , a microscopic model with spatial resolution is required to capture the deviations from bulk rates induced by the strong internal fields . indeed , the density of states being the property most affected by the field , a larger impact is to be expected on spectral quantities - such as absorption - than on integral quantities like the effective dos entering the transport model , since there , some of the field induced spectral modifications are integrated out .    , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper , it is demonstrated that straight - forward application of semi - classical models to the simulation of ultra - thin solar cells leads to severe discrepancies with respect to the more generally valid microscopic picture .",
    "this is most manifest in both spatial and bias dependence of photogeneration and radiative recombination rates due to the strong impact of the built - in field on absorption and , to a smaller extent , on emission .",
    "the results from the full quantum kinetic model can be recovered if the negf rates are used in the semi - classical transport equations .",
    "this means that transport is still well described by the drift - diffusion model , deviations from bulk dos at the band edges being integrated out .",
    "the picture is expected to change for the case where coherence plays a role in the transport , as in superlattice absorbers @xcite , similar to the situation found in thz quantum cascade lasers@xcite , or in the presence of barrier layers at the contacts@xcite . there , at least partial break - down of the validity of the semi - classical transport description is expected , necessitating the use of quantum - kinetic models such as the one presented here .",
