    "direct measurements of stellar mass ( @xmath9 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies at all redshifts provide essential information for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a wide variety of sfr indicators is currently accessible through the exploitation of a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "this has enabled us to establish , up to @xmath10 , that a tight correlation exists between these two quantities , with the bulk of star - forming galaxies clustering around a `` main sequence '' ( ms ) in the @xmath11 plane ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the ms slope and dispersion differ appreciably from one study to another , likely due to sample selection , adopted sfr indicator , extinction law , and the method used to measure stellar masses .",
    "it is clear that evolutionary studies of the ms require consistency with redshift and in particular the use of a well - calibrated sfr indicator . in the local universe ,",
    "the most accurate and extensively implemented sfr estimators are based on the h@xmath1 emission line luminosity as applied to large spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , beyond a redshift of @xmath12 , h@xmath1 is redshifted to the near - ir and one has to rely on other sfr indicators , such as [ oii ] , mid - ir , uv luminosities or @xmath13 radio flux .",
    "the `` bolometric '' infrared luminosity ( @xmath14 ) is another very powerful sfr indicator , but current herschel data are not deep enough to fully map the ms , instead identifying and characterizing outlying _ starburst _",
    "galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , efforts have been made to detect h@xmath1 in the near - ir with narrow - band imaging or grism spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but new ground - based near - ir instruments ( subaru / fiber multi - object spectrograph ( fmos ) , keck / mosfire , the very large telescope ( vlt ) /kmos ) will acquire spectra for large samples of galaxies at @xmath15 , detecting the emission lines h@xmath16 , [ oiii]@xmath174959 , 5007 , h@xmath1 , [ nii]@xmath176548 , 6583 . in particular , subaru / fmos @xcite , with its high multiplex and wide field - of - view , enables us to utilize the `` local '' sfr indicator h@xmath1 for galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "previous studies with fmos have been implemented in the low - resolution mode ( @xmath19 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the present study ,",
    "we exploit the first opportunity to use fmos in the high - resolution mode ( @xmath20 ) to detect h@xmath1 from galaxies in the cosmos field at @xmath21 as offered by our `` intensive program '' ( s12b-045 , pi : j.  silverman ) . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , ab magnitudes , and a @xcite initial mass function used consistently , including comparisons to published studies .",
    "our sample is chosen to represent the star - forming galaxy population in cosmos for which we can detect h@xmath1 .",
    "this is achieved by a selection based on stellar mass ( @xmath25 ) , photometric redshift ( @xmath26 ) , color ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and predicted h@xmath1 flux ( see below ) .",
    "these are sbzk - selected @xcite galaxies , from the catalog of @xcite , based on deep near - ir imaging from the canada - france - hawaii telescope with @xmath29 , and optical imaging ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) from subaru .",
    "photometric redshift estimates are from @xcite based on photometry as described in @xcite .",
    "a critical component of our selection further depends on the sfrs and extinction properties that likely result in the detection of h@xmath1 with a flux greater than @xmath32 , the limit corresponding to a line detection with a significance greater than 3@xmath33 for integration times of 5 hr .",
    "sfrs are estimated from the rest - frame uv luminosity as derived from @xmath30 photometry and corrected for reddening using the @xmath34 color ( following @xcite , 2007 ) . to estimate the expected h@xmath1 flux , following @xcite we use a multiplicative factor to compensate for the differential reddening between stars and line - emitting regions ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this relative reddening of stars and nebular regions is further addressed in sections [ sec : bd ] and [ sec : sfrs ] . for this study , we isolate those galaxies with an error on @xmath36 less than 0.03 mag .",
    "we highlight that the imposition of a limit on the expected h@xmath1 flux , at the level given above , results in a sample of target galaxies having moderately higher sfrs and lower levels of extinction ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we observed 755 sbzk galaxies satisfying the above criteria over six nights in 2012 march and two nights in 2013 january that essentially cover the full central square degree of cosmos .",
    "the @xmath38-long grating spans a wavelength range of @xmath39 and has sufficient throughput to detect h@xmath1 at these redshifts .",
    "all data are reduced with fmos image based reduction package ( fibre - pac ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are measured with a quality flag which describes the significance of the emission line as judged by eye in two - dimensional spectra .",
    "a flag of 2 is indicative of a strong line covering a number of contiguous pixels with both h@xmath1 and [ nii]@xmath176583 seen is some cases .",
    "emission lines with low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , whose reliability is questionable , are assigned a flag of 1 . of the 271 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "there are 168 with quality ( @xmath40 ) line detections .",
    "we note that our failures ( @xmath41 ) are likely due to either an h@xmath1 line being masked out by the oh suppression system that covers @xmath42 of the spectral range , the true redshift being outside the observed wavelength interval , or h@xmath1 being extremely weak , possibly due to high extinction .",
    "the latter is likely to place additional constraints on the characteristics of the observed sample .",
    "we acquired additional spectroscopy using the @xmath6-long grating ( @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ) to detect the h@xmath16 ( and [ oiii]@xmath175007 ) required to measure the balmer decrement and correct for extinction .",
    "these observations were carried out in 2012 march , 2012 december and 2013 february through a cooperative effort with the university of hawaii ( pi : d.  sanders ) . in our sample , 182 galaxies have both @xmath38- and @xmath6-long coverage and 89 of them have a quality detection of h@xmath1 .",
    "while most individual spectra do not show a clear detection of h@xmath16 , the emission line is highly significant in the mean spectra ( see below ) .",
    "we refer the reader to a dedicated paper ( j.  d.  silverman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) that fully describes the survey including target selection ( with a departure from color selection ) , redshift success rates , and inherent biases .",
    "we run a fitting algorithm to measure the flux and associated error of emission lines observed in the @xmath38 ( h@xmath1 and [ nii]@xmath45 ) and @xmath6 ( h@xmath16 and [ oiii]@xmath46 ) bands . to mitigate the impact of residual oh features and account for errors , we define a weighting function as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an error spectrum .",
    "each emission line is modeled by a gaussian with the lower bound on the fwhm set to the spectral resolution of the instrument ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath6-long and @xmath38-long respectively ) .",
    "we fix the width of all lines to be equivalent and the flux ratios @xmath51}\\lambda 6583/\\mbox{[n{\\sc ii}]}\\lambda6548 $ ] and @xmath52}\\lambda 5007/\\mbox{[o{\\sc iii}]}\\lambda4959 $ ] to the theoretical values of 2.96 and 2.98 @xcite , respectively . in figures  [ fig : spec](a ) and ( b ) , we show an example spectrum with a best - fit model",
    ".    we account for flux falling outside the aperture of the fmos fiber of @xmath53 diameter by the seeing conditions and the extended nature of our sources . for each galaxy",
    "we estimate the fraction of the total light sampled by fibers by using the _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) @xmath54-band images @xcite , this amounts to an assumption that the rest - frame uv and h@xmath1 emission have the same spatial distribution .",
    "this is justified by the tight correlation between the half - light radii in h@xmath1 and the acs @xmath55-band for the sins / zcsinf galaxies ( mancini et al .",
    "2011 ; c. mancini and n. m. f \" orster - schreiber , private communication ) .",
    "we smooth the acs image by convolving with a point - spread function of seeing sizes of @xmath56 and then perform photometry with _ sextractor _ @xcite .",
    "the resulting aperture correction factors are distributed in the @xmath57 range , with a typical value of @xmath58 . for bright galaxies ( @xmath59 ) the continuum level from the flux- and aperture - corrected fmos spectra agree with the @xmath6-band and @xmath38-band photometry .      since",
    "our data do not permit an evaluation of the balmer decrement for most individual galaxies , we measure the average ratio of @xmath60 as a function of both stellar mass and reddening @xmath36 . with 89 galaxies having both a quality h@xmath1 detection and a @xmath6-band spectrum ,",
    "we split galaxies into three mass and reddening bins and average their de - redshifted spectra .",
    "we perform a simple average using only pixels free of oh emission , without error weighting spectra to avoid biasing the stack toward lower extinction , typical of galaxies with high s / n line detections . in figures [ fig : spec](c ) and",
    "( d ) , we show the mean spectra binned by stellar mass .",
    "to achieve an intrinsic h@xmath1 luminosity used for determining an extinction - free sfr , we must assess the level of attenuation . throughout our analysis",
    ", we assume the applicability of the @xcite extinction law ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) .",
    "the balmer decrements @xmath60 have been widely used to quantify the reddening in not only local but higher ( up to @xmath63 ) redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath64 } ,      \\label{eq : bd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is applicable for the interstellar medium under the assumption of case b recombination @xcite with a gas temperature @xmath65 and an electron density @xmath66 .",
    "while we have a measure of the color excess @xmath36 based on the observed @xmath34 color for each galaxy ( see @xcite ) , we need to establish whether this information can be used to accurately assess the extinction affecting the nebular emission .",
    "our aim is to establish a method to apply an extinction correction for individual h@xmath1-detected galaxies lacking the detection of h@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite formulated the empirical relation @xmath67 with @xmath68 by studying a sample of low - redshift starburst galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not established whether this conversion factor is applicable for star - forming galaxies at higher redshift . while some studies at high-@xmath69 support the validity of this relation @xcite",
    ", @xcite argue that such excess reddening for nebular emission may not be needed for uv - selected galaxies at @xmath70 ( see also @xcite , for a similar conclusion ) .",
    "values of the @xmath71 factor larger than 0.44 are also favored in a recent herschel work ( m.  pannella et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . rather than being dependent on redshift",
    ", this factor may be related to specific sfr ( see equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for this exercise",
    ", we resort to using stacked spectra , as described in section [ sec : stack ] .",
    "we specifically measure @xmath72 in three bins of @xmath36 .",
    "the measured balmer line fluxes require a correction for the underlying stellar absorption , which we assume to be ew@xmath73 , ew@xmath74 @xcite . the stellar absorption impacts the h@xmath16 luminosity at the @xmath75% level while this is less for h@xmath1 ( @xmath76% ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : bd](a ) , the nebular extinction @xmath72 ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 that corresponds to @xmath77 . furthermore , there is a clear correspondence between the nebular and stellar extinction that can be fit with a linear relation characterized by @xmath78 , a factor that is dissimilar to the canonical value of 0.44 and is consistent within the errors with an extrapolation of the relation from @xcite .    in figure 2(b ) , we compare the level of extinction of fmos and low - redshift galaxies , i.e. , @xmath79 ( at a given stellar mass ) as derived from the individual values of @xmath36 for each galaxy and modified by our new factor @xmath80 .",
    "star - forming galaxies at @xmath81 from sdss dr9 are indicated with stellar masses provided by mpa - jhu and the best - fit relation of @xcite .",
    "while showing very good agreement between the two samples at the low - mass end , the fmos sample is elevated from the best - fit relation of sdss galaxies at higher masses .",
    "this is in slight disagreement with results from @xcite at @xmath82 , who implemented a hybrid approach using [ oii]/h@xmath1 calibrated against the balmer decrement of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "this inconsistency may not be surprising since the use of the [ oii]/h@xmath1 ratio as a indicator of dust attenuation is questionable , given that the gas - phase metallicity and the ionization parameter can also affect this ratio .",
    "however , we can not definitely rule out agreement with both of these studies due to the uncertainties of our extinction corrections . a best - fit relation to the fmos data ( small yellow circles in figure  [ fig : bd](b ) ) can be expressed as follows : @xmath83}.      \\label{eq : ahalpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in table  [ tb : stack ] , we list our measurements based on our line - fitting routine and provide the derived measure of extinction in bins of @xmath36 and stellar mass .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : stack ]",
    "we now compare the sfrs derived from h@xmath1 and from uv , assuming that both intrinsic sfrs are the same and then determine what level of extinction ( as parameterized by our factor @xmath71 ) is needed to match the observed values . in figure [ fig : hauvsfr ] , we plot the ratio @xmath84 for our quality ( @xmath40 ) sample as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "sfrs are derived from @xmath85 using equation ( 2 ) of @xcite or from @xmath86 using equation ( 7 ) of @xcite .",
    "we see a clear correlation between this ratio and the reddening thus we can express the ratio of the observed sfrs in terms of both @xmath36 and a specific value of @xmath71 as follows : @xmath87 it is apparent that our data clearly falls well above the line representing the case where @xmath68 . while the @xmath80 case as determined from the balmer decrement is more closely aligned with the observed data than the canonical value , we find that a best - fit of equation ( [ eq : hauvsfr ] ) to the data yields a value of @xmath88 .",
    "this best - fit value of @xmath71 is specific to the present sample , the procedures adopted to estimate the sfrs and assumed extinction law .",
    "based on the limitations of the current data set , we conclude that the value of @xmath71 likely lies between 0.69 and 0.83 . for subsequent analysis , we average the results of the two approaches to arrive at a factor @xmath89 .",
    "the similarity between h@xmath1- and uv - based sfrs seen here is further checked in a companion study that includes the far - ir data ( g. rodighiero et al . , in preparation ) .    - to uv - based sfrs as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the typical errors are shown in the lower right corner .",
    "the lines show the relations with different values of @xmath71 ( equation ( [ eq : hauvsfr])).,height=240 ]      we derive sfrs using equation ( 2 ) from @xcite from extinction - corrected h@xmath1 luminosities based on the color excess for each galaxy modified for nebular emission using @xmath89 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ms ] , sfrs are shown to cover a range of @xmath91 typical for star - forming galaxies at these redshifts , and exhibit a close relation with stellar mass as described in the literature as the `` main sequence '' .",
    "a fit to all h@xmath1 detections ( @xmath92 and 2 ) yields the following relation : @xmath93}. \\label{eq : ms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation has a very similar normalization and slope as compared to related studies at high - redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . we recognize that the slope may be biased low due to the sensitivity limit of our survey ( @xmath94 ; see section  [ sec : observations ] ) ; such a bias is typical of spectroscopic samples that are more likely to measure a redshift if the sfr is above the average near the low - mass limit of the survey .",
    "the slope is also dependent on the adopted extinction law .",
    "we measure the width of the ms to be @xmath95 , somewhat lower than typically reported values ( @xmath96@xmath97 dex ) .",
    "such comparisons are not trivial since the observed width is dependent on various factors such as the redshift range considered , the imposed selection on expected h@xmath1 flux , the impact of redshift failures , and variations in dust extinction not properly accounted for . on the other hand",

    "we are undertaking a major initiative using subaru / fmos to carry out a near - ir spectroscopic survey of star - forming galaxies in cosmos at @xmath98 .",
    "our aim is to further our understanding of galaxies in an environmental context at epochs close to the peak of the sfr density .",
    "we present the first results based on the early data to measure the sfrs based on the @xmath99 emission line and establish the relation between the sfr and the stellar mass .",
    "this has entailed a detailed study of the extinction properties of our sample , based both on measurements of the balmer decrement in bins of color excess ( stellar ) and stellar mass , and a comparison of h@xmath1 and uv - based sfr indicators . due to the complex selection of our sample and success rate of emission line detection ,",
    "our results pertain to a specific subset of the overall high - redshift galaxy population and are as follows :    * the extinction @xmath79 ranges between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as measured from the balmer decrement , and appears to exceed the corresponding values for low - redshift galaxies in sdss at @xmath102 . *",
    "the relation between the nebular and stellar extinction is determined to be @xmath67 where @xmath71 is between 0.69 and 0.83 .",
    "this differs from the canonical factor ( @xmath68 ) and may indicate a more uniform dust distribution in high-@xmath69 galaxies as compared to local galaxies .",
    "this suggests that hot , massive stars and hii regions are spatially correlated more tightly in high redshift galaxies .",
    "* a @xmath11 relation based on h@xmath1 luminosity , corrected for extinction , shows a clear correspondence between these two parameters with a slope of 0.81 , a width of 0.22 dex , and a normalization ten times elevated from the local relation that is in close agreement with related high-@xmath69 studies .",
    "the higher levels of extinction seen in our sample may be a consequence of both gas masses and sfrs being typically @xmath103 higher ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in galaxies at @xmath90 as compared to local counterparts .",
    "nonetheless , we may expect some modulation of the extinction due to the lower metallicities typically seen in high - redshift galaxies , which was first noted by @xcite for a sbzk - selected sample ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy metallicities will be presented in a companion study ( h.  j.  zahid et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . to conclude , we highlight that further spectroscopic coverage of h@xmath16 will improve stacked spectra and average balmer decrements , with detections for individual galaxies giving the extinction dispersion at a given mass , thus lessening biases in the current sample .",
