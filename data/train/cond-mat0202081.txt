    "it is well known @xcite that the peltier effect is the basis for solid thermoelectric cooling .",

    "electric current flows through this contact .",
    "boundary conditions in an electric current contact have been discussed in a previous work .",
    "@xcite here we are interested in the heat flow .",
    "the absorption or extraction of heat ( cooling or heating ) depends on the current direction .",
    "the traditional approach to determine the quantity of this heat ( peltier heat ) is based on the generalized thermal conductivity law , @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the heat flux density , @xmath2 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the electrochemical potential of the charge carriers , @xmath5 is the electric potential , @xmath6 is the chemical potential of the carriers , @xmath7 is the charge of the carriers , @xmath8 is the peltier coefficient , @xmath9 is the electric current density .    let us suppose that the temperature gradient is absent in the electric circuit , and that the electric current flows through the contact of two media ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume also that the lateral sides of the circuit are adiabatically insulated , and that the circuit has a unit section .",
    "let us choose the small volume bounded by the planes @xmath10 near the contact @xmath11 , and calculate the peltier heat @xmath12 at this volume under the presence of the electric current ( see fig.1 ) . in the linear approximation to the electric current ( we neglect the joule heating )",
    "this heat per unit time is equal to @xmath13    we integrate over the surface limiting the chosen volume in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath14 is the peltier heat density , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the surface element , @xmath17 is the external normal . for the simple chosen geometry",
    "it is straightforward to verify that in the limit @xmath18 ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the peltier coefficients of the first and the second materials , and @xmath21 is the electric current .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 determines the peltier heat at the contact between the two media . under fixed current direction",
    "@xmath23 if @xmath24 and the contact is heated . on the contrary , if @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the contact is cooled . actually the thermoelectric cooling modules are fabricated from two semiconductor brunches with electron ( n ) and hole ( p ) type conductivities.@xcite figure  2 illustrates the sketch of this module .",
    "two semiconductors are coupled electrically in series and thermally in parallel . for non - degenerate electrons ( n ) and holes ( p),@xcite @xmath27.\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath3 is the temperature in energy units , @xmath28 are the chemical potentials of electrons and holes which are measured from the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band , respectively ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the band gap ) , @xmath31 is the hole charge , @xmath32 are the exponents in the momentum relaxation times,@xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the energy of the carriers .",
    "the constant quantities @xmath35 and @xmath32 for different relaxation mechanisms can be found elsewhere.@xcite .        for degenerate electron and hole gases ,",

    "notice that , similar to the chemical potentials , the mean energies @xmath38 are measured from the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band respectively .",
    "often the chemical potentials @xmath28 are interpreted as the potential energies of electrons and holes.@xcite    for non - degenerate statistics ( @xmath41 ) ,    @xmath42    while for the degenerate case ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44    to demonstrate the physical meaning of the peltier effect , a metal - n - type semiconductor contact is usually used ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the surplus of the electron energy in the semiconductor , in comparison with the metal , is @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the obtained result is clear for this type of contact . at the same time",
    "these contacts are not really used in applications .",
    "the consideration of other contacts do not have the same obvious understanding , and a priori the following questions arise :    * what does the potential energy for the degenerate gas of the charge carriers mean ? *",
    "what is the physical meaning of the energy change in a metal - p - semiconductor contact and in a p - n junction ?",
    "* why does the approach stated above ignore the work of the built - in electric field within the contact ?",
    "* it is easy to show that the value @xmath47 in any type of contacts is different on the left and on the right from the contact plane .",
    "therefore , the description of the contact refrigeration based on the consideration of the separate electron transitions is not valid .",
    "one needs to take into account the statistics of these transitions .",
    "how to reflect this fact in the preceding scheme ?",
    "in the usual scheme of n - n or p - p junctions the contact heating or cooling is explained by the electron ( hole ) transitions between @xmath48 - levels ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the latter are counted from the common fermi level . in p - n junctions",
    "it is necessary to take into account the electron - hole generation and recombination .",
    "these are the processes that determine contact cooling and heating . in most works devoted to discuss this problem ,",
    "the recombination rate is assumed to be infinite .    ) ]    .",
    "[ fig:4 ]    here we present some new assumptions . let us consider first the n - n contact between non - degenerate semiconductors ( fig.5 ) .",
    "if the momentum scattering in both semiconductors is the same , then [ see eq.(7 ) ] ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the contact voltage , and @xmath51 is the work of a valence force .",
    "this means that the contact cooling or heating is connected with the work of the built - in electric field @xmath52 and the work of the valence forces @xmath53 .",
    "the total work is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here",
    "the valence force is caused by the abrupt change of the conduction band .",
    "a similar reasoning is valid for the p - p junction .",
    "is the vacuum level ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 are workfunctions and electron affinities , respectively.,width=302 ]    if we have the @xmath59 or @xmath60 junction , the peltier effect does not depend on the contact properties , and it is determined only by the parameters of the non - degenerate semiconductor ( see fig.3 ) , @xmath61    in the case of a contact between two degenerate n- or p - type semiconductors ( or two metals ) the peltier effect depends on the contact properties again ( see figs.6 and eq.(10 ) ) , and the work of the built - in electric field jointly with the work of the valence forces occurs .",
    "now @xmath62            comparing ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) we see that the peltier heat in the contact between degenerate materials is essentially less than that in the contact between the non - degenerate semiconductors .",
    "let us note also that the work of the built - in electric field and the valence forces give rise to the qualitatively different temperature of the contacts in the case of non - degenerate and degenerate brunches of the circuit . in the former @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the non - equilibrium temperature , @xmath65 is the built - in electric field",
    ", @xmath66 is the room temperature . in the latter , @xmath67",
    "let us examine the p - n junction ( fig.7 ) .",
    "it is easy to see from fig.7 that @xmath68    the generation or recombination at the contact causes the peltier heating or cooling in this case .",
    "in addition , eq.(15 ) corresponds to the infinitely strong recombination rate . at the same time",
    "there are a lot of situations when this rate is weak enough",
    ". what has happened with the peltier effect in this case ?",
    "the situation is similar to the electric current or thermoelectric current in the bipolar semiconductors .",
    "@xcite the fermi quasilevels must appear causing the redistribution of carriers concentrations , electric fields and conductivity . as a result",
    "the nature of the peltier effect can drastically change .",
    "it follows from fig.8 that under the chosen current direction the cooling exchanges to the heating if the recombination is absent .",
    "we do not present here the detailed calculations , and give only the main equations for this problem .",
    "the general approach to the problem of the contact cooling or heating accounting for the generation and recombination processes requires the solution of the following set of equations :    @xmath69    here @xmath70 are the electron and hole electric current densities ; @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the concentrations of non - equilibrium electrons and holes , and @xmath73 are the electron and hole recombination rates . +",
    "a rigorous theory of recombination suggests that @xmath74 is identically equal to @xmath75 and therefore for all recombinatiion mechanisms in a linear approximation we have @xcite @xmath76    the values of @xmath77 are material parameters having the dimension of time , but they are not electron and hole lifetimes .",
    "however , when the condition of quasi - neutrality holds @xcite ( @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the debye radius and @xmath80 is the width of the p - n junction ) , as it is often the case , the non - equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are equal ( @xmath81 ) . in this case",
    "one can define a lifetime common to electrons and holes as    @xmath82    from a previous work,@xcite it follows that @xmath83 ; therefore , the lifetime of non - equilibrium carriers can be expressed as @xmath84    as it is well known , @xcite using poisson equation in a quasi - neutrality approximation becomes unnecessary , and the electric potential at the boundary of two semiconductors displays jump - like changes .",
    "the boundary conditions to eqs.(16)-(18 ) can be found elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the surface recombination rates present in these boundary conditions are @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the parameters characterizing the contact properties .",
    "if the quasi - neutrality conditions ( @xmath81 ) are satisfied , a surface recombination rate common to electrons and holes can be introduced : @xmath88 therefore one can write @xmath89",
    "in this section we will present qualitative arguments regarding the two limiting cases of very strong and very weak recombination rates .",
    "the criteria for these rates have been discussed in @xcite . according to those results ,",
    "the surface and the bulk recombination rates are strong if @xmath90 , or @xmath91 respectively , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes , @xmath95 and @xmath96 and are the electron and hole conductivity ; @xmath97 .",
    "the inequalities @xmath98 and @xmath99 determine the weak surface and bulk recombination .",
    "if the strong recombination occurs , then the physical process in the p - n junction is as in fig.7 , and eq .",
    "( 12 ) is right . in the opposite case ( weak recombination )",
    ", electrons from the n - region will pass to the p - region and occupy the states with mean energy @xmath100 ( cf .",
    "fig.8 ) . by analogy holes will pass to the n - region and will occupy the states with the mean energy @xmath101 . in the latter case , under the appropriate current direction , the contact is heated and the cooling is absent .    in conclusion",
    ", we wish to emphasize that the contact refrigeration is a promising field for applications in different spheres of human activity .",
    "in particular , a proper description of the physical processes involved is very important in the today s problem of acheaving high values of the figure of merit @xmath102 for thermoelectric materials .",
    "@xcite all the efforts devoted to this problem up to now @xcite have been based on the expression @xmath103 @xciteor in the simpler expression @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are , respectively , electron and hole thermoelectric power , thermal conductivity and electric resistance . @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the thermoelectric power and the electric conductivity of an effective medium .",
    "we want to underline that in thermoelectricity this expression is good for the circuit consisting of the metal and semiconductor of n - type and for another materials if the surface and the bulk recombination is very strong . at the same time",
    "this formula must be revised in the case of the contacts metal - p - semiconductor and in p - n junctions , where the recombination processes are essential even in the linear approximation .",
