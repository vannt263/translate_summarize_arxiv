    "in a deformable porous solid filled with two immiscible fluids ( water and air , say ) , two sources of hysteresis are observed : the solid itself is subject to irreversible plastic deformations , and the fluid flow exhibits capillary hysteresis which is often explained by the surface tension on the interfaces between the two fluids .",
    "a lot of works have been devoted to this phenomenon , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "mathematical analysis of various mechanical porous media models with capillary hysteresis and without temperature effects has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "a pde system for elastoplastic porous media flow with thermal interaction was derived in @xcite , but the existence of solutions was only proved for the isothermal case .    here , we focus on the qualitative analysis of the model derived in @xcite , assuming in addition that the heat conductivity depends in a controlled way on the temperature similarly as in the phase transition model considered in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we borrow here some techniques employed in @xcite and @xcite in order to prove existence of a weak solution for the initial boundary value problem associated with the pde system coupling the momentum balance ( cf .  ) , featuring , in particular , a thermal expansion term depending on the temperature field , with a mass balance ( cf .  )",
    "ruling the evolution of the capillary pressure , and an energy balance ( cf .  ) displaying , in particular , quadratic dissipative terms on the right hand side .",
    "the main mathematical difficulties are related to the low regularity of the temperature field mainly due to the presence of the high order dissipative terms in the internal energy balance .",
    "this is the reason why we need to employ here a key - estimate ( cf .  ) , already exploited in @xcite and more recently in @xcite for the analysis of non - isothermal phase transition models . roughly speaking ,",
    "since the test of the internal energy balance by the temperature @xmath0 is not allowed , we test by a suitable negative power of it and use the growth condition of the heat conductivity @xmath1 in hypothesis [ h1 ]  ( ii ) . another key point in our proof",
    "is the @xmath2 estimate we get on the pressure which entails a bound in a proper negative sobolev space for the time derivative of the absolute temperature , which turns out to be another fundamental ingredient in order to pass to the limit in our approximation scheme .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . the model from @xcite",
    "is briefly summarized in section [ mod ] . in section [ hys ]",
    "we recall the definitions and main results of the theory of hysteresis operators that are used here .",
    "section [ mai ] contains the mathematical hypotheses and statements of the main results . in section [ reg ]",
    "we regularize the problem by adding a small parameter @xmath3 accounting for `` micro - movements '' and a large cut - off parameter @xmath4 to control the nonlinearities , and solve the regularized problem by the standard faedo - galerkin method . in section [ pt1 ]",
    "we let @xmath3 tend to @xmath5 and @xmath4 to @xmath6 and prove that in the limit , we obtain a solution to the original problem .",
    "consider a domain @xmath7 filled with a deformable solid matrix material with pores containing a mixture of liquid and gas .",
