    "dielectron spectra have been measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite and the star collaboration @xcite in au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "in fact , dileptons have been proposed as a kind of clear probe in the study of the hot and dense matter named quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , created in heavy ion collisions @xcite , due to the fact that dileptons do not interact strongly and therefore survive the whole evolution of a heavy ion collisions .",
    "this concerns the initial hard scattering drell - yan pairs , the thermal emission from the qgp and the hadron gas phase , and the decay of light and heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "the dielectron spectra from both star and phenix show the low mass enhancement beyond the cocktail .",
    "this phenomenon was also observed in the ceres dielectron @xcite and na60 dimuon data @xcite .",
    "medium modifications of the @xmath6 meson spectral functions have been considered to describe this enhancement , based on hadronic many body effective theories @xcite and using a relatively simple expanding fireball model .",
    "another approach used the forward scattering amplitude method @xcite and viscous hydrodynamics with smooth initial conditions as medium .",
    "these two methods could get a similar result @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two methods @xcite could also describe the star dielectrons data reasonably well , using a 2 + 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model .",
    "in addition , a microscopic transport model- parton - hadron string dynamics ( phsd ) @xcite has successfully described the observed dimuon enhancement by na60 and dielectron enhancement by star .",
    "elliptic flow is the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal particle distribution .",
    "the thermal elliptic flows of dileptons has been studied in hydrodynamic simulations with smooth initial conditions @xcite and also with fluctuating initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations seem to play an important role in elliptic flows of dileptons in heavy ion collisions",
    ". however , the predicted elliptic flows of thermal dileptons are small , so do their predicted elliptic flows of direct photons . the observed large elliptic flow of direct photons seems a big puzzle in our field . using epos3102 , a ( 3 + 1)d viscous hydrodynamic model well constrained by hadron data",
    ", it seems that one can reproduce naturally the measured elliptic and trianger flow of direct photons@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will compute thermal dilepton production in an approach which has been successfully tested concerning hadron and photon production .",
    "this will serve as a benchmark to a systematic compilation of hadron , dilepton and photon results .    in additional to the thermal sources",
    ", dileptons may be produced from non - thermal sources such as primordial drell - yan annihilation and electromagnetic final - state decays of long - lived hadrons . to account for these ,",
    "star cocktail results from refs  @xcite have been employed in this paper .",

    "we briefly review the calculation approach of thermal dilepton emission rates from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and hadronic matter . in section 3",

    "finally , a conclusion is made in section 4 .",
    "the calculation of dilepton production is obtained as an integration over an emission rate @xmath7 , based on the space - time evolution of a qgp and the hadronic stage according to epos3@xcite .",
    "we use a qgp emission rate from extrapolating lattice qcd results to finite momenta .",
    "the calculation of the hadronic emission rate is done by employing the vector meson dominance model .",
    "we consider explicitly the @xmath6 meson , for the rest we refer to the so - called cocktail according to the star experiment ( dileptons from decays of measured resonances )  @xcite .",
    "this procedure to compute dileptions , discussed in more detail in the following , will be referred to as epos3+dil1 .      as explained in @xcite , epos3 is an event generator based on a 3 + 1d viscous hydrodynamical evolution starting from flux tube initial conditions , which are generated in the gribov - regge multiple scattering framework @xcite .",
    "an individual scattering is referred to as pomeron , identified with a parton ladder , eventually showing up as flux tubes ( or strings ) . each parton ladder is composed of a pqcd hard process , plus initial and final state linear parton emission .",
    "nonlinear effects are considered by using saturation scales @xmath8 , depending on the energy and the number of participants connected to the pomeron in question .",
    "the final state partonic system ( corresponding to a pomeron ) amounts to ( usually two ) color flux tubes , being mainly longitudinal , with transversely moving pieces carrying the @xmath9 of the partons from hard scatterings @xcite .",
    "one has two flux tubes , based on the cylindrical topology of the pomerons , but each quark - antiquark pair in the parton ladder will cut a string into two , in this sense one may have more than two flux tubes . in any case , these flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter , also referred to as `` core '' @xcite ( which thermalizes , flows , and finally hadronizes ) and jets ( also referred to as `` corona '' ) , according to some criteria based on the energy of the string segments and the local string density .",
    "concerning the core , we use a 3 + 1d viscous hydrodynamic approach , employing a realistic equation of state , compatible with lqcd results .",
    "we employ for all calculations in this paper a value of @xmath10 .",
    "whenever a temperature of @xmath11mev is reached , we apply the usual cooper - frye procedure to convert the fluid into particles . from this point on",
    ", we apply a hadronic cascade @xcite , based on hadronic cross sections .",

    "this is the basis of the dilepton ( rate ) calculations discussed later . in the hadronic phase , we have from epos a complete description of hadron trajectories .",

    ", urqmd has been employed after freeze - out in epos , and macroscopic quantities such as energy - momentum and flow velocity are reconstructed in order to calculate thermal emissions of dileptons and photons , as mentioned earlier .",
    "the emission rate is the number of dileptons emitted per space - time unit and per energy - momentum unit .",

    "<S> dileptons , as an electromagnetic probe , are crucial to study the properties of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the invariant mass spectra and the anisotropic emission of thermal dielectrons from au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energy @xmath0  gev based on epos3 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a realistic ( 3 + 1)-dimensional event - by - event viscous hydrodynamic description of the expanding hot and dense matter with a very particular initial condition , and a large set of hadron data and direct photons ( besides @xmath1 and @xmath2 ! ) can be successfully reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> thermal dilepton emission from both the qgp phase and the hadronic gas are considered , with the emission rates based on lattice qcd and a vector meson model , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the computed invariant mass spectra ( thermal contribution + star cocktail ) can reproduce the measured ones from star at different centralities . </S>",
    "<S> different compared to other model predictions , the obtained elliptic flow of thermal dileptons is larger than the star measurement referring to all dileptons . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a clear centrality dependence of thermal dilepton not only for elliptic flow @xmath1 but also for higher orders . at a given centrality , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 of thermal dileptons decreases monotonically with @xmath4 for @xmath5 . </S>"
