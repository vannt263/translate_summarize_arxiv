    "grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath0 @xcite are very attractive candidates to unify the strong , weak and electromagnetic forces into a single force , as well as to shed light on some of the open questions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "quarks and leptons of each family are unified into a single irreducible representations of @xmath0 group , the 16-dimensional spinor , which also contains the right - handed neutrino .",
    "the presence of the right - handed neutrino makes the seesaw mechanism @xcite for generating small neutrino masses very compelling in these theories .",
    "since @xmath0 gauge symmetry is automatically anomaly - free @xcite , it provides a nice explanation for the miraculous cancelation of anomalies that occurs within each fermion family .",
    "the observed quantization of electric charges is also understood in these theories owing to their non - abelian nature .",
    "unifying all fermions into a single multiplet gives us the hope of understanding some aspects of the flavor puzzle in these theories .",
    "unification of gauge couplings occurs naturally at an energy scale of @xmath10 gev @xcite , as @xmath0 admits an intermediate symmetry group  unlike theories based on @xmath11 which must break directly to the sm .",
    "it is of course well known that if supersymmetry is assumed to be present in its minimal version at the tev scale , one - step breaking of @xmath0 directly down to the sm can be realized at an energy scale of @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is , however , @xmath0 theories without the assumption of supersymmetry .",
    "we wish to inquire what an economic yukawa sector would look like in renormalizable @xmath0 theories .",
    "this may appear to be a well understood issue , but as we suggest here , this question has not been properly resolved .",
    "economy may be viewed as having the least number of higgs fields as well as yukawa parameters while being realistic .",
    "assuming that there are no new fermions beyond the three families of chiral 16s ( or other real representations ) with gut scale masses exist and mix with the chiral 16s , new possibilities are available , see for e.g. , ref .",
    "] the answer to this question may be found in the group theory of fermion bilinears : @xmath13 here the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for symmetric and antisymmetric components ( in family space ) .",
    "the 10 and the 120 are real representations in @xmath0 , while the 126 is complex .",
    "the most general renormalizable yukawa couplings in @xmath0 theories then would take the form @xmath16 here the index @xmath17 takes values @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of @xmath1 fields employed , and similarly the index @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the number of @xmath2 and @xmath24 present in the theory .",
    "the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath27 complex symmetric matrices in family space , while @xmath28 are complex antisymmetric matrices .",
    "we wish to identify the smallest possible set of \\{@xmath29 } that would lead to a realistic spectrum of quark and lepton masses as well as mixing angles .",
    "this set will turn out to be the choice @xmath30 , as we shall see .",
    "this result is satisfying , as it suggests that nature has utilized each possible higgs field for fermion mass generation exactly once , without any replication .    before establishing this assertion , which will be done in the next section ,",

    "@xmath34 may be constructed from _ two real _ 120s . in these cases ,",
    "the yukawa couplings will involve terms of the type @xmath35 as well as @xmath36 with completely independent yukawa coupling matrices , and similarly for the @xmath34 field .",
    "it is possible to assign a charge exterior to @xmath0 to these fields  such as the peccei ",
    "quinn @xmath37 motivated on other grounds  so that the yukawa couplings contain only the @xmath35 term , and not the @xmath36 term . these restricted class of yukawa couplings in @xmath0 have been studied extensively @xcite . while interesting , the predictions of such models are those of @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a symmetry exterior to @xmath0 , and not of the true grand unified symmetry @xmath0 itself .",
    "our inquiry relates to the minimal yukawa sector in theories where only the @xmath0 gauge symmetry plays a role .",
    "it should be noted that in theories which assume supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is not the focus of the present work , chiral superfields are necessarily complex , thus requiring the complexification of 10 and 120 higgs fields .",
    "holomorphy of the superpotential would imply that the coupling @xmath36 is not present simultaneously with the superpotential term @xmath40 .",
    "these models share some of the features of non - susy models based on @xmath41 , although the renormalization group evolution of the fermion mass parameters between the weak scale and the gut scale would be different in the two classes of theories .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath0 models have been studied extensively , and it has been shown that economic models where only a ( complex ) @xmath1 and a @xmath24 couple to fermions can be predictive and consistent with all fermion masses and mixings @xcite @xcite . if the additional higgs fields needed for symmetry breaking are restricted to a @xmath3 and a @xmath42 , split supersymmetry may be required for consistency @xcite . alternatively , a ( complex ) @xmath2 may be introduced to relax some of the restrictions imposed by the symmetry breaking sector @xcite .",

    "2 we present our proof that the economic higgs sector will have @xmath30 . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the predictions of this model for quark and lepton masses and mixings . here",
    "we present our numerical study which shows full consistency with experimental data . in sec .",
    "4 we present the constraints on these models from the unification of gauge couplings ; in sec .",
    "5 we calculate the proton decay branching ratios . in sec .",
    "6 we conclude .",
    "four appendices contain a discussion on how the fine - tuning is achieved , technical details on the proof of economic yukawa sector as well as the best fit parameters for the minimal model .",
    "in this section we establish the assertion that @xmath30 is the economic choice of yukawa sector in non - supersymmetric @xmath0 theories .",
    "this corresponds to choosing one real @xmath1 , one real @xmath2 and a complex @xmath24 of higgs bosons that have yukawa couplings with the three chiral families of @xmath43 .",
    "an additional higgs filed belonging to @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath42 would be needed for completing the symmetry breaking .",
    "these fields , however , do not have yukawa couplings with the @xmath43 , and the precise choice is not so important for now .",
    "a proof of our assertion would require that the choice @xmath30 leads to a realistic fermion spectrum , and no other simpler choice exists consistent with realism .",
    "the former part of the proof is delegated to sec .",
    "3 where we perform a numerical analysis of this economic yukawa sector ; here we address the latter part .",
    "if only one higgs field among @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath24 is present in a theory , there would be no flavor mixing  as the yukawa coupling matrix of this single higgs field can be diagonalized using an @xmath0 rotation .",
    "thus at least two higgs fields are needed for realistic fermion spectrum .",
    "one of the fields used must be a @xmath3 , since it gives large majorana masses to the righ - handed neutrinos directly .",
    "this field also plays a role in the symmetry breaking sector , as it breaks @xmath0 down to @xmath11 , reducing the rank .",
    "one could consider replacing the @xmath3 with a @xmath46 which can play a similar role in rank reduction .",
    "in such a case the right - handed neutrino can acquire a large majorana mass via the two - loop witten diagram @xcite involving gauge boson and scalar loops .",
    "the induced majorana mass can be estimated @xcite to be of order @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath0 gauge coupling , @xmath49 is the yukawa coupling of @xmath1 , and @xmath50 is the @xmath51 breaking vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath46 . in a nonsupersymmetric @xmath0 theory @xmath50 is well below the gut scale for consistency with gauge coupling unification , with its range being @xmath52 gev depending on the surviving intermediate symmetry .",
    "@xmath53 is then of order @xmath54 gev or less , which is too small to reproduce the correct order of magnitude for the light neutrino masses .",
    "the susy particle masses should be of order the gut scale to prevent additional suppression factor of @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ two - loop ] ) , which may cause a problem with generating a higgs boson mass of 125 gev @xcite . ]    keeping one @xmath3 field in the theory , we seek if a realistic fermion spectrum can be generated with the addition of a second higgs field .",
    "this turns out to be not possible . if the second higgs field is a @xmath3 , the mass relations @xmath56 and @xmath57 will result at the gut scale , which are inconsistent with observations .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 is found to be about 1.7 at the gut scale ( with small input errors ) when the low energy mass parameters are evolved up to the gut scale using sm renormalization group equations .",
    "we found that this ratio is more realistically in the range @xmath59 , when intermediate scale threshold effects arising from the right - handed neutrino sector and the gauge bosons of @xmath60 are included .",
    "each of the two threshold effects causes a decrease in the ratio @xmath58 at the gut scale .",
    "we conclude that the relation @xmath61 is clearly excluded .",
    "the relation @xmath62 is not too far off ( our rge evolution shows the ratio @xmath63 to be about 4 at the gut scale ) , while @xmath64 is off by an order of magnitude . thus a minimal yukawa sector consisting of two copies of @xmath24 is not realistic .",
    "if the second higgs field is a real @xmath1 , two complex symmetric yukawa matrices can be written down , one with the @xmath1 , and one with the @xmath24",
    ". however , the higgs doublet in the @xmath1 is self - conjugate , and is contained in the @xmath65 representation of the pati - salam subgroup @xmath66 .",
    "this field can be written as @xmath67 in general , if the ( 1,1 ) element of @xmath68 is independent from the ( 2,2 ) element , we can denote their respective vacuum expectation values to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath69 giving mass to the up - quarks and dirac neutrinos , while @xmath70 generates down - quark and charged lepton masses .",
    "the reality of @xmath1 implies that @xmath71 , and thus the ratio @xmath72 . with @xmath73 ,",
    "the needed splitting between the top and bottom quark masses can not be achieved .",
    "note that @xmath73 is a special case of the general @xmath41 models with @xmath74 .",
    "such models have been studied , which find the phenomenological requirement @xmath75 . a three generation analysis of fermion masses and mixings with a complex @xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that a realistic fit requires @xmath76 , which is well outside of the prediction of @xmath73 in the case of real @xmath1 .",
    "thus we conclude that one @xmath24 and one real @xmath1 is not realistic @xcite .    what about using one @xmath24 and one @xmath2 ? as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this case also can not reproduce fermion masses correctly .",
    "the ratio @xmath77 comes out to be of order one , rather than the phenomenological value of @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , as we shall show , this model predicts the gut scale mass ratio @xmath79 , with any deviation of order @xmath80 .",
    "as already noted , the ratio @xmath81 at the gut scale in @xmath0 models under discussion .",
    "thus we conclude that only two higgs fields being responsible for yukawa couplings can not be realistic .",
    "when three higgs fields are introduced , the choice of one @xmath1 , one @xmath2 and one @xmath24 appears attractive , as there in no replication here .",
    "this choice can indeed lead to a realistic fermion mass spectrum , as we elaborate in the next section .",
    "there would be two complex symmetric yukawa coupling matrices in this case , along with one complex antisymmetric matrix .",
    "if an alternative choice of one @xmath24 and two copies of @xmath2 can lead to a realistic spectrum , that would have less parameters with one symmetric and two antisymmetric yukawa matrices .",
    "however , as we show in appendix b , this choice would lead to the relation @xmath61 with corrections of order 5% , even when one allows for large off - diagonal contributions to the mass matrices from the @xmath2 .",
    "models with one @xmath24 and two copies of @xmath1 would be realistic ; however , these models would have three complex symmetric yukawa matrices which have more parameters compared to the case of one @xmath1 , one @xmath2 and one @xmath24 .",
    "this completes the first part of the proof that @xmath30 is the economic choice for the yukawa sector . to complete the proof we establish in the next section that this choice is indeed realistic .",

    "as is well known , any grand unified theory has to address the question of making one higgs doublet light , while its color triplet gut partner remains superheavy so as to not cause rapid proton decay .",

    "if the higgs doublet mass is not split from the color triplet mass , either the electroweak symmetry would break at the gut scale , or not break at all , or the light color - triplet would lead to far too fast proton decay .",

    "we note that this is nevertheless only one fine - tuning , albeit not easily enforceable by actual calculations .",
    "the hermitian higgs doublet mass matrix is tuned to have near - zero determinant .",
    "in contrast , in minimal susy guts , the needed tree level tuning requires the determinant of the complex doublet higgsino mass matrix to be near zero .",
    "recall that in susy all mass parameters in the superpotential are complex in general .",
    "such a tuning amounts to two conditions , unlike the non - supersymmetric tuning , which requires only one such condition .",
    "although the higgs mass can be ensured only after including very high order corrections in non - susy @xmath0 , we find it intriguing that the fine - tuning condition is more minimal here compared to minimal susy @xmath0 .",

    "<S> we show that in @xmath0 models , a yukawa sector consisting of a real @xmath1 , a real @xmath2 and a complex @xmath3 of higgs fields can provide a realistic fit to all fermion masses and mixings , including the neutrino sector . </S>",
    "<S> although the group theory of @xmath0 demands that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 be real , most constructions complexify these fields and impose symmetries exterior to @xmath0 to achieve predictivity . the proposed new framework with _ real _ @xmath1 and _ real _ @xmath2 relies only on @xmath0 gauge symmetry , and yet has a limited number of yukawa parameters . </S>",
