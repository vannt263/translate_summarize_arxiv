    "( [ basicfesr ] ) requires the suppression of contributions from that part of the contour @xmath29 near the timelike point  @xcite .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by working with `` pinched '' weights , @xmath26 , i.e. those having a zero at @xmath30 .    .",
    "many authors have employed the `` @xmath31 spectral weight sum rules '' , for which the integrand on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ basicfesr ] ) is @xmath32 .",
    "these sum rules are `` inclusive '' , in the sense that the @xmath31 spectral integrals , denoted @xmath33 , can be constructed from the experimental distribution without having to first perform a separation of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components .    in flavor - breaking differences such as @xmath36 or @xmath37-@xmath38 ,",
    "the leading @xmath39 ope terms cancel , leaving as leading contribution a @xmath40 term , essentially proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "appropriately - weighted fesr s involving such differences thus , in principle , allow one to determine @xmath0 .",
    "flavor - breaking spectral combinations of the @xmath31 spectral weight type are constructed by forming @xmath42 a number of determinations of @xmath0 using flavor - breaking sum rules have appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we discuss some non - trivial complications , not all of which have been effectively tamed in the majority of these analyses , below .",
    "recently it has been realized that @xmath2-decay - based , flavor - breaking sum rules also provide a novel method for extracting @xmath1  @xcite , one whose systematics are completely independent of those associated with alternate determinations based either on combining lattice results for @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 data  @xcite or on @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-decay - based determination is competitive for the following reason .",
    "the difference of rescaled @xmath47 and @xmath4 spectral integrals corresponds to an integrated correlator difference with exactly cancelling @xmath39 ope contributions only if the correct @xmath1 is used to rescale the experimental @xmath4 data .",
    "an incorrect @xmath1 leaves a residual @xmath39 contribution . since the @xmath40 term in the @xmath4 v+a ope is _",
    "very _ small compared to the leading @xmath39 term , even a small error in @xmath1 yields a sizeable @xmath39 residual .",
    "the integrated @xmath39 and @xmath40 ope contributions scale differently with @xmath48 , so such a @xmath39 residual can be detected by studying the @xmath48 dependence of the two sides of the resulting fesr .",
    "if one has external information on @xmath0 , this can also be used as input on the ope side in order to determine the @xmath1 value for which the desired @xmath39 cancellation occurs . an ideal sum rule for this purpose would be one for which the weighted @xmath40 ope integrals were as small as possible , reducing errors associated with uncertainties in the input value of @xmath0 , and/or possible slow convergence of the integrated @xmath40 series .",
    "for such a sum rule , the fractional uncertainty on @xmath1 would be essentially half that on the integrated @xmath4 spectral integral , a figure which could be rather small when b factory spectral data is finally available .",
    "this ideal situation is not as well realized as one might hope for most of the weights discussed to date in the literature .",
    "we discuss this point further below .",
    "four main complications are encountered in analyzing flavor - breaking @xmath2-decay - based fesr s : ( i ) the bad behavior of the integrated @xmath40 longitudinal ope series ; ( ii ) the convergence ( order by order in @xmath49 ) of the integrated @xmath50 @xmath40 ope series ; ( iii ) the role of possible @xmath51 ope contributions and ( iv ) strong @xmath47-@xmath4 spectral integral cancellations for many of the weights employed in the literature ( leading to significant _ fractional _ errors on the resulting difference , and hence also in the extracted values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that the convergence of the integrated @xmath40 longitudinal ope series relevant to the determination of @xmath0 is very poor  @xcite . in `` contour",
    "improved perturbation theory '' ( cipt ) , e.g. , even at the highest possible scale , @xmath52 , the integrated @xmath53 series behaves as @xmath54 .",
    "the non - convergence is even worse in fixed order perturbation theory , and/or for @xmath55 .",
    "one obvious solution is to restrict one s attention to the better - behaved @xmath50 sum rules , where the problem does not arise .",
    "this , however , requires a separation of the @xmath7 components of the experimental spectral distribution , which is not feasible experimentally at present .",
    "many analyses have , therefore , employed `` inclusive '' ( @xmath21 plus @xmath50 ) sum rules and attempted to assign conservative errors to the @xmath56-truncated , badly - converged integrated @xmath40 longitudinal ope sum .",
    "this procedure turns out to violate inequalities among longitudinal contributions to the flavor - breaking @xmath57 spectral weight sum rules which folow from the positivity of @xmath58 and/or @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on this point in the next paragraph .",
    "while the @xmath60 and @xmath61 pole contributions to the longitudinal spectral functions are well known experimentally , the `` continuum '' contributions ( beginning at @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the @xmath4 v and a channels , respectively ) are not . for the flavor @xmath47 correlators ,",
    "these are proportional to @xmath64 , and numerically negligible .",
    "the chiral suppression is of @xmath65 and hence much less strong for the @xmath4 v , a correlators .",
    "the basic fesr relation , combined with the known pole term values , ensures that any prescription for handling the weighted longitudinal @xmath4 @xmath40 ope series translates into a statement about the correspondingly - weighted longitudinal continuum spectral integral .",
    "denote this contribution by @xmath66^c_l$ ] for the @xmath31 spectral weight case . then , since @xmath67 for @xmath68 , spectral positivity ensures that the @xmath69^c_l$ ] must ( i ) be a decreasing function of @xmath70 and ( ii ) satisfy the rigorous inequalities",
    "@xmath71_l^c < 0.87 \\left[\\delta^{(k,0)}\\right]_l^c\\ . \\label{rigorous}\\ ] ] for kinematic reasons , one expects the @xmath72 and @xmath73 resonances to dominate @xmath69^c_l$ ] . neglecting other contributions ,",
    "the even stronger constraints @xmath74_l^c\\simeq 0.44 \\left[\\delta^{(0,0)}\\right]_l^c$ ] and @xmath75_l^c\\simeq   0.22 \\left[\\delta^{(0,0)}\\right]_l^c$ ] are obtained . the @xmath76 @xmath69^c_l$ ]",
    "implied by the @xmath56 @xmath40 ope truncation prescription ( employing a @xmath70-independent @xmath0 ) are , in contrast , in the ratios @xmath77 , badly violating even the weaker constraint , eq .",
    "( [ rigorous ] ) .",
    "since the experimental spectral distribution necessarily respects spectral positivity , independent fits for @xmath0 using different @xmath57 fesr s will , unavoidably , produce central values having an unphysical decrease with @xmath70 .",
    "such a decrease is seen in all inclusive @xmath57 analyses .",
    "a large portion of the observed instability - with-@xmath70 can be attributed to the violation of spectral positivity  @xcite .",
    "much improved stability is obtained for the longitudinally - subtracted @xmath50 version of the @xmath57 analysis  @xcite .",
    "the absence of an experimental spin separation means that , to avoid the above problems , and work with the better - behaved @xmath50 sum rules , one needs theoretical input for the unknown ( continuum ) part of the longitudinal spectral distribution .",
    "the flavor @xmath4 a part can be obtained from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which determines the excited @xmath61 decay constants from a sum rule analysis of the flavor @xmath4 pseudoscalar correlator ) ; the flavor @xmath4 v part , similarly , from a detailed study of the related flavor @xmath4 scalar correlator  @xcite .",
    "details may be found in the original references    these analyses can also be used to obtain independent determinations of @xmath0 ; the consistency of these determinations with those from the @xmath50 @xmath2 decay sum rules provides further support for their reliability .    .",
    "it turns out that , even if one assigns very conservative errors ( @xmath78 ) to these determinations , the impact on the uncertainties in the resulting longitudinally - subtracted @xmath50 sum rules is small .",
    "the reason is easily understood .    to simplify discussion ,",
    "consider the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) for the @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding decay constants , @xmath79 , vanish in the @xmath80 chiral limit and hence receive a chiral suppression ( proportional to @xmath0 ) for physical @xmath0 . the corresponding longitudinal spectral contributions ( @xmath81 )",
    "are thus doubly chirally suppressed relative to the @xmath60 and @xmath61 pole terms . in the nwa , taking the @xmath53 spectral weight case to be specific , the integrated longitudinal contribution of a scalar or pseudoscalar state of mass @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath83 the kinematic factor , @xmath84 , is @xmath85 for the @xmath61 and @xmath86 for the @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the relative size of the integrated longitudinal continuum and @xmath61 pole contributions is determined almost entirely by the square of the ratio of the corresponding decay constants , and is doubly chirally suppressed . since the @xmath61 pole contribution is very accurately known , even rather large errors on the continuum contribution will correspond to small errors on the full ( pole plus continuum ) longitudinal spectral integral .",
    "the subtraction needed to go from the inclusive experimental @xmath53 spectral integral to the analogous @xmath50 component thereof can thus be performed with good accuracy .",
    "extra factors of @xmath87 , present for the higher @xmath57 sum rules , will further suppress continuum contributions relative to the leading @xmath61 pole term , making the longitudinal subtraction even more reliable .    in summary ,",
    "( i ) the conclusion that only non - inclusive , @xmath50 flavor - breaking fesr s should be employed in future seems unavoidable , in view of the severity of the problems with the corresponding inclusive fesr s ; ( ii ) the longitudinal subtraction needed for a determination of the spectral integrals of the @xmath50 sum rules is dominated by the well - known @xmath61 pole term , and can be performed with good accuracy , with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to be used for the small flavor @xmath4 continuum contributions ; ( iii ) having accepted the necessity of performing a longitudinal subtraction , one of the major arguments in favor of the use of the @xmath31 spectral weights ( the possibility of avoiding a spin separation of the experimental spectral data ) is no longer operative , and one is free to explore alternate weight choices which may improve the accuracy with which the ope and/or spectral integral sides of the resulting flavor - breaking @xmath50 sum rules can be evaluated .",
    "we will return to the latter point below .",
    "the necessity of a longitudinal subtraction means that one must focus on sum rules for the flavor - breaking @xmath50 correlator .",
    "experimental and theoretical uncertainties are reduced by working with the difference of the v+a sums for the flavor @xmath47 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "two points , related to the question of the convergence of the integrated ope series , require discussion : the behavior of the integrated @xmath40 series , and the treatment of contributions with @xmath51 .      in the @xmath89 scheme ,",
    "the @xmath40 term in the ope of the @xmath50 v+a @xmath4 correlator is proportional to @xmath90 ^ 2/q^2 $ ] times the series  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 and the @xmath93 coefficient is the pms estimate based on the @xmath94 result reported by chetyrkin at this meeting  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath95 , the convergence of the last few terms of the series is actually very slow at the spacelike point on the circle @xmath29 , even at the largest scale , @xmath52 , allowed by kinematics . as one moves along the circle toward the timelike point",
    ", however , the logarithmic running of @xmath49 causes @xmath96 to decrease , improving the convergence of the correlator series .",
    "different choices of fesr weight , which emphasize different regions of the circle , can thus lead to integrated @xmath40 series with significantly different convergence behaviors . within the @xmath57 spectral weight family , e.g. , one expects increasing @xmath70 to produce slower convergence , since the additional factors of @xmath97 weight more and more heavily contributions from the part of the circle near the spacelike point , where convergence is slowest .",
    "cancellations on the contour can also play a role in determining the convergence of the integrated series .",
    "the convergence behavior of the integrated @xmath47-@xmath4 v+a , @xmath50 @xmath40 ope series for the @xmath57 spectral weights is illustrated in table 1 .",
    "the contributions have been evaluated using cipt , for @xmath52 .",
    "the results are normalized to the leading ( @xmath98 ) term .",
    "we have included an @xmath93 contribution generated using the pms estimate for the @xmath93 correlator coefficient    it is worth noting that the analogous estimate for the @xmath94 coefficient  @xcite turned out to be reliable with an accuracy of @xmath99 .    .",
    "the pattern of convergence is typically somewhat worse if one works with the adler function , rather than the correlator itself ( see chetyrkin s talk at this meeting for more on this point ) .",
    "the convergence also deteriorates significantly as @xmath48 decreases .",
    "note that the convergence of the @xmath53 series is _ not _ good , despite the impression an @xmath100 truncation might give .",
    "the @xmath100 contribution happens to be small because of cancellations among contributions from different parts of the ope contour ; this cancellation , however , is `` accidental '' , in the sense that it does not persist for higher order contributions .",
    "similar accidental cancellations occur for the other @xmath57 cases , though at orders which increase with @xmath70 ; as a result , only a hint of this behavior shows up in the table for @xmath101 .",
    ".15 in    .convergence of integrated @xmath88 @xmath40 ope series for the @xmath57 , @xmath102 spectral weights [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ vusstability ]    the results show a high level of sensitivity to ckm input for those weights having the strongest cancellation .",
    "the strong cancellation also leads to large fractional errors for the integrated @xmath47-@xmath4 differences .",
    "this effect is responsible , e.g. , for the large errors quoted on @xmath53 spectral weight fesr determinations of @xmath0 in the literature .",
    "large shifts in the central values of @xmath0 caused by apparently rather small changes in the total strange branching fraction value are also the result of this high level of cancellation .",
    "( another example of this effect will be seen in the next section . )",
    "the cancellation is at a much more acceptable level for the @xmath103 and @xmath104 weights .",
    "unfortunately , as we have seen above , these weights have rather slow @xmath40 convergence , as well as large coefficients which make neglect of @xmath51 contributions more problematic .",
    "more accurate @xmath4 data , especially in the region above @xmath105 , might allow alternate weights to be constructed which deal with this problem more effectively , without producing a deterioration in the @xmath47-@xmath4 error situation .    in view of the above - noted `` close cancellations '' , it is desirable to reduce , where feasible , the error on any particular @xmath47-@xmath4 spectral integral .",
    "evaluating the @xmath60 and @xmath61 pole term contributions using the more accurate @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xmath44 and @xmath45 determinations is helpful in this regard .",
    "while one should obviously check that @xmath2 decay determinations of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 br s are compatible with standard model ( sm ) expectations based on @xmath44 and @xmath45 data , attempts to extract @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 from @xmath2 decay data are predicated on the assumption that beyond - the - sm effects may be neglected in @xmath2 decay ; there is , thus , no compelling reason to use the larger - error @xmath2-decay - based pole term values in such analyses .",
    "we illustrate some features of the above discussion by considering a determination of @xmath1 analogous to that reported in ref .",
    "a value @xmath110 mev , representing an average ( with conservative errors ) from non-@xmath2-decay based determinations is used on the ope side of the various fesr s .",
    "the corresponding spectral integrals are based on the recently - reported opal update of the @xmath4 spectral database  @xcite , with the following caveats . at present , neither the numerical values of the opal @xmath4 spectral distribution nor the corresponding covariance matrix have been made publicly available .",
    "opal has reported spectral integrals , with fully correlated errors , only for the @xmath57 spectral weights , and , for these , only at @xmath52 . to work out spectral integrals for either non - spectral weights , or for spectral weights , but at @xmath55 , we follow the strategy used previously by aleph ( see the two papers by s. chen et al . in ref .",
    "explicitly , we start with the 1999 aleph @xmath4 spectral distribution  @xcite and rescale that part of the spectral distribution associated with each exclusive mode by the corresponding ratio of current to aleph 1999 branching fractions .",
    "to guide the eye we include `` experimental '' errors generated using the publicly - available aleph covariance matrix .",
    "we have also employed @xmath44 and @xmath45 results in evaluating the @xmath60 and @xmath61 pole term contributions .",
    "the results of this exercise for a selection of the weights discussed above , as a function of @xmath48 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ vusstability ] . to avoid ( further )",
    "cluttering the figure , ope errors have not been included .",
    "the figure shows considerable instability for the @xmath53 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 spectral weights .",
    "good stability is observed for @xmath111 , @xmath112 and the @xmath113 spectral weight .",
    "the instability of the @xmath53 determination is almost certainly a consequence of the poor convergence behavior of the integrated @xmath40 ope series .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence , together with the comparison of the results for the range of different weights shown , gives one confidence in an extracted value of @xmath1 represented by the convergence of the four lowest weight cases as @xmath114 in the figure , @xmath115 .",
    "more detailed results , with realistic experimental and ope errors will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we conclude with a further illustration of the sensitivities of output parameters to small changes in experimental data , resulting from strong cancellations in the @xmath47-@xmath4 spectral integral differences .",
    "the above result for @xmath1 employed the world average , @xmath116 , for the @xmath117 branching fraction . if one instead shifts to the average , @xmath118 , of the opal and cleo determinations , which are in good agreement , and not in good agreement with aleph , the central value of @xmath1 , e.g. , from the good - stability @xmath111 extraction , changes from @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
