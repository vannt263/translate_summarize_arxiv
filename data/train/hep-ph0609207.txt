    "from these computations one would expect the lightest glueball in the scalar sector in the mass range up to about 1800 mev . in this search",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      a unique solution for @xmath23 mev has been suggested recently by kamiski , pelez and yndurin @xcite who found good agreement for the @xmath24 wave phases from the three above mentioned determinations up to 1400 mev : cm - i , cm - ii ( sols . @xmath25 or , equivalently here @xmath26 , or sols .",

    "we can obtain a further selection among the remaining ambiguities above 1400 mev by comparing with the reaction @xmath29 with its different ambiguity structure .",
    "such data have been obtained from @xmath30 collisions at 100 gev / c ( gams @xcite ) and at 18.3 gev ( e852 @xcite ) . for our study",
    "we use the gams data which extend to masses @xmath31 mev with good accuracy .",
    "we also take into account the @xmath32 amplitude @xmath33 . for the mass range @xmath34 mev we represent the data @xcite on phases and inelasticities by the parametrizations @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] ( masses in gev ) .",
    "the errors on the inelasticity at the higher energies are rather large @xmath37 .    for further analysis of elastic @xmath38 scattering",
    "we take the cm - ii results which use the full correlation matrix in the determination of the amplitudes and therefore have small statistical errors , but the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are qualitatively similar . as cm - ii used an older purely elastic @xmath33 wave we recalculated @xmath39 from the measured @xmath38 amplitude assuming @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining two @xmath41 amplitudes @xmath39 ( @xmath26 and @xmath25 ) corrected in this way are shown in in fig .",

    "[ fig : swave00 ] is shown the amplitude @xmath42 for the process @xmath29 which we extracted from the magnitude @xmath43 , the phase @xmath44 and the breit wigner phase of @xmath45 in the @xmath46 wave as determined from gams data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41 amplitude @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath47 and is shown in the same diagram . a second solution from the unresolved sign of @xmath48",
    "is rejected by the unitarity requirement .",
    "the amplitude @xmath39 so obtained shows a circular motion from 1000 to 1740 mev with a smaller circle superimposed above 1400 mev .",
    "this behaviour is only consistent at the qualitative level with the @xmath38 solution @xmath26 which we therefore select as the physical solution .",
    "there are some remaining discrepencies between the results on @xmath39 from both processes . these we attach to systematic errors in the determination of the overall phase from leading resonances , from truncation of higher partial waves and the uncertainty in the @xmath32 amplitude",
    ". these uncertainties over large mass scales should not affect the nature of local resonance phenomena like @xmath2 or @xmath5 .",
    "it is nevertheless satisfactory that agreement within these limitations is obtained .",
    "it shows the production of @xmath2 , the small circle , with parameters roughly according to pdg ( m=1500 mev , @xmath49=109 mev ) and with branching ratio into @xmath1 of @xmath50 , whereas we estimate from the depth of the circle @xmath51 .",
    "the polarised target ckm data on @xmath52 @xcite which are determined in a model independent way agree better with cm - ii for @xmath53 mev and better with gams for @xmath54 mev with its higher inelasticity .",
    "next we look for resonances in the solution @xmath55 of cm - ii ( corrected ) .",
    "we represent the @xmath24 matrix for the 3 channels ( @xmath56 ) as product of 3 matrices for resonances @xmath57    @xmath58^{-1 }     \\nonumber\\\\     & &    \\phantom{xxx}\\times\\rho^{\\frac{1}{2}t } ( g_ig_j)\\rho^\\frac{1}{2 }      \\label{smatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 .",

    "[ fig : glueball ] .",
    "it corresponds to a mass parameter in ( 2 ) of @xmath63=1100 mev and a total width of similar size .",
    "the parametrization ( 2 ) with constant @xmath64 has not the threshold behaviour expected from chiral theory .",
    "the adler zero can be enforced by multiplication of the couplings with @xmath65 .",
    "we found that this modification has little effect in the mass range considered here ( @xmath66 ) mev , but one may expect that the pole position in the amplitude has shifted from 1100 mev towards a lower value .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 and the @xmath67 effects are presumably the same phenomena .",
    "the dependence of the pole position on the actual line shape can be seen in a simple unitary model amplitude with adler zero , communicated to us by h. zheng @xcite ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 with pole at @xmath70 . in the extreme cases , for small coupling the pole is near @xmath71 mev ) , whereas for very strong coupling @xmath72 re @xmath73 , i m @xmath74 re @xmath75 .",
    "we note that there is no evidence for @xmath5 from our fitting .",
    "this state would show up as a second circle in the argand diagram and as another dip in @xmath76 at the corresponding mass . if we allow for such a state in the fit the mass tends towards 1500 mev and the width to decrease such that the additional circle fits into the first one .",
    "we therefore exclude an additional state with branching ratio @xmath77 near 1370 mev .",
    "results are also available on the inelastic processes @xmath78 where the reconstructed argand diagrams @xcite show one extra circle above background .",
    "explicit fits @xcite have denied a second narrow resonant state beyond @xmath2 , contrary to the recent study @xcite , so this situation has to be clarified .",
    "the main evidence for @xmath5 comes from fits to 3-body final states in low energy @xmath79 annihilation and @xmath80 decays , also central @xmath81 production of the decays @xmath82 .",
    "none of these studies have presented a full 2-dim energy - independent phase shift analysis showing the existence of a second circle .",
    "such studies are essential in processes with large background from a broad resonance and considerable @xmath32 components .",
    "we see the following arguments in favour of the broad state to be a glueball .",
    "+ 1 . in our interpretation of the spectrum",
    "the broad state , presumably identical to @xmath67 , does not belong to a nonet .",
    "in particular , we would not add this effect centered around 1 gev , at least not entirely , to a light nonet of any kind , so it is `` left over '' in the @xmath8 systematics .",
    "the state is produced in most processes considered as `` gluon rich '' .",
    "in radiative @xmath80 decays a broad or constant contribution has been seen in @xmath83 @xcite , in @xmath84 @xcite , but not yet in @xmath85 which may be difficult ; furthermore in central production , like @xmath86 and in annihilation , like @xmath87 and also in @xmath88 @xcite with the gluonic contribution @xmath89 .",
    "the broad state appears together with @xmath2 in channels @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the signs of interference in these channels are consistent with @xmath2 being a flavour octet ( as in models @xcite ) and @xmath4 being near a flavour singlet @xcite .",
    "another expectation is the suppression of glueball production in @xmath92 processes .",
    "based on the earlier result @xcite on @xmath93 we noted @xcite a relative suppression in comparison with @xmath45 .",
    "a better study in the 1000 mev region is important .",
    "i would like to thank peter minkowski for the collaboration on these topics and to ugo gastaldi , stephan narison and hanqing zheng for the discussion about the scalars ."
