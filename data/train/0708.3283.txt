    "q - balls @xcite occur in a wide variety of ( theoretical ) physical contexts .",
    "they appear naturally in the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite as condensates of squarks or sleptons .",
    "the larger ones ( @xmath0 ) can have a crucial cosmological significance as dark matter candidates @xcite if they are stable or long living , or ( since they carry baryon or lepton number ) as a possible explanation for the baryon asymmetry in the universe @xcite and the baryon to dark matter ratio @xcite .",
    "small q - balls @xcite can be produced even more easily in high temperatures and may also be found as dark matter . they may also be produced in colliders for direct inspection of their interesting properties @xcite .",
    "see also e.g. enqvist&mazumdar@xcite and dine&kusenko @xcite for further reviews .",
    "a large number of discussions of various other aspects of q - balls exists already with different approaches : analytic @xcite , mixed - analytic and numerical @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite for addressing more complicated issues like scattering ( not yet in 3 spatial dimensions ) and so on .",
    "all the above - mentioned q - ball studies are based on the `` original '' flat space q - balls .",
    "however , it is evident that for a large enough mass scale , gravitational effects become important and one needs to study q - stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of q - stars was demonstrated by friedberg _",
    "et al _ @xcite and by lynn @xcite .",
    "further studies revealed more features like the fact that gravity limits the size of q - balls @xcite or the properties of spinning q - stars @xcite , or made generalizations like q - stars with non - minimal coupling to gravity @xcite .    furthermore , unifying theories ( typically in higher dimensions ) lead frequently to non - linear sigma models , so q - balls and q - stars should be studied in these models as well .",
    "although topological solitons in non - linear sigma models @xcite have been studied for decades , it seems that non - topological solitons of the same models have received very little attention .",
    "this work will be devoted to a special type of those : q - balls and their self - gravitating counterparts , i.e. sigma model q - stars .",
    "sigma model q - balls and q - stars are spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations derived from the action @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a non - negative dimensionless function , which may be interpreted as a weyl factor of a conformally - flat ( two - dimensional ) target space metric .",
    "a particularly simple system which will be studied here is the o(3 ) sigma model @xcite which corresponds to @xmath3 .",
    "this is the conformal factor of a target space of @xmath4 with a diameter @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 is a non - negative potential which will be chosen such as q - ball solutions will exist as will be explained below .",
    "more notations and conventions : @xmath7 is the covariant derivative , the signature is @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is newton s constant and @xmath11 will denote the einstein tensor .",
    "the field equations derived from the action ( [ action1 ] ) are : @xmath12 and @xmath13 + u(|\\phi|)g_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{einstv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to @xmath14-u(|\\phi|)g_{\\mu\\nu } = 0 \\label{einstv2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is well - known that in flat space and a proper choice of potential which `` contains any attractive interaction however weak '' @xcite , the `` linear '' system @xmath15 has non - topological solitons stabilized by the global u(1 ) charge @xmath16 .",
    "the u(1 ) current density in the general case is given by the slightly modified expression @xmath17 the simplest way to obtain non - vanishing u(1 ) charge is to allow a uniform rotation in target space ( `` field space '' ) , @xmath18 and indeed it can be proven @xcite that this must be the form of the field which minimizes the energy within the sector of a given @xmath16 in the `` linear '' theory .",
    "the generalization to the `` non - linear '' case is straightforward .",
    "the condition of finite charge leads to the boundary condition @xmath19 at infinity .",
    "if we assume further spherical symmetry , @xmath20 will depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath21 and the line element will take the usual form @xmath22 note that the @xmath23 factor indeed modifies the energy - momentum tensor but keeps it static .",
    "einstein equations ( [ einstv2 ] ) for q - stars become @xmath24 and they should be supplemented by the scalar field equation : @xmath25    the charge and mass are given by @xmath26 we note that the sigma q - star can be viewed as a bound state of @xmath27 elementary bosons ( that is , it is stable against decay into free bosons ) if @xmath28 . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume @xmath29",
    "so we will have @xmath30 as well .    actually , we have to solve a system of three differential equations : eq .",
    "( [ scalareqqball ] ) and only two of the three eqs ( [ einseqqballsr00])-([einseqqballsrang ] ) . by taking combinations of those three we get two first order equations ( which may be obtained directly from the @xmath11 equations ) .",
    "it is more comfortable and efficient to introduce a dimensionless mass function @xmath31 and use it instead of the metric function @xmath32 following the definition @xmath33 note that @xmath34 is the accumulated mass up to radial coordinate @xmath21 and the total mass of the q - star is the limit @xmath35 which we simply abbreviate by @xmath36 where there is no danger for ambiguity .",
    "since the solutions are localized , @xmath34 becomes essentially constant quite fast ( this is one reason for using it instead of @xmath32 ) , and using the numerical radial end point instead of infinity is accurate enough .",
    "it is also simpler and more natural to revert to an angular field @xmath37 defined by @xmath38    it is straightforward to rewrite the field equations in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath39 and actually to cast them in a dimensionless form which is ready for numerical solution .",
    "we get :    @xmath40 \\label{sigmaeinseqqballsg00dmlss } \\\\ \\left(1-\\frac{2{\\cal m}}{x}\\right)\\frac { xa'}{a}= \\gamma x^2\\left[\\frac{\\overline{\\omega}^2 \\sin^2 ( \\theta)}{8a^2 } + \\left(1-\\frac{2{\\cal m}}{x}\\right)\\frac{\\theta'^2}{8}-u(\\theta)\\right]+\\frac{{\\cal m}}{x } \\label{sigmaeinseqqballsg11dmlss } \\\\",

    "actually , the flat space limit of this system with a conserved global charge have been studied already to some extent under the title `` q - lumps '' @xcite , which refer to solutions which carry additional _ topological _ charge .",
    "this kind of topological solutions exists only in lower dimensionality or at most as stringlike in four dimensions .",
    "however , we will be able to find flat space ( as well as self - gravitating ) spherical solutions ( in four spacetime dimensions ) since we give up topological non - triviality .",
    "therefore , our solutions may be simply regarded as sigma model q - balls and q - stars stabilized by the global charge alone . within the context of the present discussion ,",
    "the difference between q - balls and q - lumps is just a difference in the boundary conditions : both kinds require @xmath45 ( for finite charge ) but q - lumps exist for @xmath46 while the sigma q - balls we find need @xmath47 . these boundary conditions are related to the potential functions and it turns out that q - balls and q - stars are easily obtained for a large family of potentials having a global minimum at @xmath48 and another local one .",
    "we will use the simple form @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 so the potentials ( whose local minimum is always at @xmath52 ) are : @xmath53 we will see that the difference between the corresponding solutions will be analogous to those between the 2 - 3 - 4 and the 2 - 4 - 6 potentials of the `` linear '' system @xcite .",
    "the first term in both potentials is just a simple mass term which adds up with the @xmath54 term as in the `` linear '' system .",
    "the normalization is such that @xmath5 is still the mass of the elementary free scalars .",
    "we choose representative values of @xmath55 for the 2 - 3 potential and @xmath56 for the 2 - 4 one .",
    "the potentials are shown for these values in figure [ figuresigmapot ] .",
    "as usual , one may get the main properties of the q - balls from the `` effective potential '' @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 will take values between @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the corresponding central fields are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "due to the `` north - south '' symmetry which is left in the potential functions there exists of course another family of `` mirror '' solutions with the boundary condition @xmath63 instead of the usual @xmath45 that we are using .",
    "the second boundary condition will satisfy accordingly @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , our choice does not lead to any loss of generality of the results that will be presented here , but it should be kept in mind that they apply to two different families of solutions .",
    "we study solutions with both potentials for the three values @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "as can be guessed from inspection of the `` effective potential '' , the `` thin wall '' and `` thick wall '' solutions exist for both potentials in a way similar to the `` linear '' case .",
    "it is obvious that there are no flat space solutions with @xmath68 , that is a mass term only .",
    "gravity changes the situation and allows solutions which are the sigma model analogues of the boson star solutions , so we may call them `` sigma stars '' .",
    "one difference with respect to boson stars is that these sigma stars do not enjoy a scaling symmetry and do not fall on a one - parameter curve in parameter space .",
    "therefore the @xmath69 family of pure self - gravitating sigma model solutions which we present is not universal .",
    "the main results are shown in figures [ figuresigqslogq - fx0]-[figuresigma24qsbeoverqvslogq ] .",
    "the first , figure [ figuresigqslogq - fx0 ] shows the charge as a function of the central field @xmath70 in all cases .",
    "it covers the region of maximal charge for @xmath71 , although the maximum is so narrow that its width can not be seen it the plots .",
    "it may be expected that curves of the mass as a function of @xmath70 are superposed in these plots , but they are not easily identified in this resolution .",
    "however , the plots for the binding energy per particle , figures [ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvsfx0]-[figuresigma24qsbeoverqvsfx0 ] give enough information about the masses being larger or smaller than @xmath72 for a given @xmath70 . more insight into the situation",
    "is added by the plots of the binding energy per particle vs. charge , figures [ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvslogq]-[figuresigma24qsbeoverqvslogq ] .",
    "a new characteristic with respect to the `` linear '' solutions is the limiting value of the central scalar field @xmath70 which is the same for both potentials : @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , now the same limiting @xmath70 appears also for the self - gravitating solutions and not for q - balls only .",
    "the reason for this is the special form of the potential functions that we chose , which yields the minimum of the effective potential to be at @xmath73 for all values of @xmath54 .",
    "we stress also that @xmath52 is the equator of @xmath4 and does not correspond to @xmath74  see eq .",
    "( [ thetadef ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that a different choice of potential function will allow larger values of @xmath75 .",
    "another new characteristic is the existence of `` mirror '' solutions with different boundary conditions .",
    "the possibility of coexistence of solutions of both type and their interaction deserves further study .",
    "generally , we find a close parallelism between the main properties of the sigma q - balls / q - stars and the analogous `` ordinary '' q - balls / q - stars",
    ". the `` damped oscillations '' of @xmath16 beyond its maximum which exist in the `` linear '' model @xcite exist also here but they are only partially visible in figure [ figuresigqslogq - fx0 ] due to the @xmath73 limit . as before the solutions are stable against decay into free bosons only in a limited region of @xmath70 values which corresponds to positive binding energy , or @xmath76 .",
    "note however that charge degeneracy ( two masses or more for the same @xmath16 ) exists , so even in this region a higher mass state may decay into a lower state plus additional free bosons while conserving @xmath16 .",
    "the other solutions with negative binding energies may either decay completely into free bosons , or will have a smaller stable boson star among their decay products .",
    "the sigma q - balls with the 2 - 3 potential are always stable with ever growing charge .",
    "gravity imposes maximal charge values : for @xmath77 the maximum is at @xmath78 and @xmath79 or @xmath80 , while for @xmath81 the maximum is at @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding central scalar field is so close to @xmath83 that we give it as @xmath84 .",
    "the sigma star solutions with @xmath77 that appear in figure [ figuresigqslogq - fx0 ] have a maximum at @xmath85 and @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "these values define the region of stable solutions . as figures",
    "[ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvsfx0 ] and [ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvslogq ] show , all the others are either unbound ( with negative binding energy ) , or may decay into the stable solutions while conserving particle number .",
    "the 2 - 3 q - star curve with @xmath81 in figure [ figuresigqslogq - fx0 ] is very similar to the @xmath65 q - balls ( below the maximum of @xmath82 ) and it is impossible to distinguish between them .",
    "the difference shows up in the binding energy which is shown in figures [ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvsfx0]a and [ figuresigma23qsbeoverqvslogq ] .    the solutions with the 2 - 4 potential exhibit a more involved structure which may be described again according to the central field value .",
    "the small @xmath70 sigma q - balls ( no gravity : @xmath65 ) are large and unstable .",
    "the stability region starts at @xmath88 for which @xmath89 and extends all the way to @xmath73 with monotonically increasing charge and mass .",
    "for @xmath81 the small @xmath70 behavior changes completely .",
    "the small @xmath70 solutions have positive binding energies for @xmath90 ( for which @xmath91 ) , passing through a local maximum of charge at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "an instability region follows for @xmath94 .",
    "the second range of bound solutions starts at @xmath95 for which @xmath96 and goes toward @xmath97 .",
    "there is however a global charge maximum of @xmath98 very close to @xmath99 .",
    "i.e. such that @xmath100 .",
    "we may therefore conclude that for this 2 - 4 potential there are stable sigma q - stars for any charge up to a maximal value of @xmath98 for the parameters we chose .",
    "some charge intervals exhibit charge degeneracy , so the higher mass solutions will decay .",
    "the solutions for @xmath77 have similar behavior with two main quantitative differences : the maximal charge is now much smaller and has a value of @xmath101 and all solutions have in this case positive binding energy due to the stronger gravitational self - attraction .",
    "as far as the flat space limit is concerned , the 2 - 3 solutions may be divided into two types in accordance with two regions of the central field interval @xmath102 .",
    "the sigma q - stars in most of this interval are similar to the flat space ones and the limit @xmath103 ( keeping @xmath70 fixed ) gives well - behaved sigma q - balls .",
    "these q - stars may be classified as solitonic since their existence does not depend upon gravity .",
    "the exception is the small region near ( and below ) @xmath73 where there are only self - gravitating solutions so they are non - solitonic .",
    "the 2 - 4 solutions may be divided into three types : in the region of small @xmath70 and near @xmath73 gravity gives rise to ( non - solitonic ) solutions with no flat space limit , while in the medium @xmath70 values the solutions may be considered solitonic .",
    "we found new q - ball and q - star solutions in the sigma model system .",
    "we presented the main properties of the solutions in flat spacetime and for two values of the gravitational strength @xmath81 and @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding characteristics are quite different for the different values of @xmath104 as is evident from the plots of charge vs. central field described above , together with the analysis of the @xmath70 and @xmath16 dependence of the binding energy .",
    "we found that the sigma model q - ball and q - star properties depend strongly on the form of the potential term and that the q - star solutions split into two main types : one is self - gravitating version of the flat space q - balls , while the other may be identified as non - solitonic solutions which do not have a flat space limit .",
    "there is a close parallelism with the `` ordinary '' q - ball and q - star solutions @xcite : the correspondence is between the sigma model with the 2 - 3 potential and the `` linear '' system with 2 - 3 - 4 potential , and sigma model with the 2 - 4 potential and the `` linear '' system with 2 - 4 - 6 potential .",
    "however , there are some important differences .",
    "the most interesting is the existence of two `` mirror '' families of solutions differing by their boundary conditions .",
    "the possibility of coexistence of solutions of both types and their interaction was not discussed here but deserves further investigation .",
    "another issue which calls for a further study is that of spinning q - balls and q - stars . although interesting results @xcite already exist for the `` linear '' system , an analogous study for the new sigma model solutions does not exist .",
    "a further more systematic analysis is needed in order to clarify questions like the relation between charge , mass and angular momentum of spinning q - stars .",
