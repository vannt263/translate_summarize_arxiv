    "<S> it is seen that below room temperature , the calculated magnetization reproduces the measured values quite well but gradually deviates from the experimental data as the temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> as the magnon mode occupancy increases with temperature , it gives rise to relatively large cone angles , especially for long wavelength modes . </S>",
    "<S> the frozen magnon method that is based upon a small cone angle assumption ( analogous to the harmonic approximation ) is no longer applicable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , magnon modes start to interact with each other and deviate from pure bosonic character @xcite .    to examine the effect of overestimating @xmath16 more clearly , we switch to the empirical uncorrelated spin disorder scheme ( disordered moment : dm ) introduced in @xcite to reproduce the experimental magnetization at every temperature in addition to the correlated lattice disorder obtained by populating phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a larger resistivity @xmath17 ( red circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ) that agrees remarkably well with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> below room temperature , the lack of correlation in the spin disorder leads to a slightly higher resistivity than what is seen in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the underestimation of the fully _ ab initio _ scheme , @xmath15 , is attributable to the overestimation of the magnetization at higher temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fm alloys._within the adiabatic approximation , our ability to describe from first principles the temperature dependence of transport properties is limited by our ability to characterize temperature - dependent lattice and spin disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the limitations posed by the harmonic approximation of lattice dynamics could be circumvented by using _ </S>",
