    "since the seminal work of burridge and knopoff @xcite , spring - block models have been recognized as useful tools to study earthquake dynamics @xcite . because they are simple to treat , both theoretically and computationally , spring - block models can provide important physical insights that might otherwise be much more difficult to obtain .",
    "models with many blocks have been used to investigate the origin of certain power laws that appear in the statistics of earthquakes , such as the gutenberg - righter law for the size - distribution of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "spring - block models with only a few degrees of freedom , on the other hand , can probe the basic dynamics of frictional sliding and are also of interest in their own right as examples of low - dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "for instance , two - block models have been found to exhibit chaos @xcite , thus suggesting that actual faulting might perhaps be a chaotic phenomena . even in the simplest case of a one - block model ( with the block moving on a line ) the dynamics",
    "is highly nontrivial .",
    "indeed , this system displays a discontinuous transition from creep to stick - slip motion as one varies a parameter governing the dependency of the friction force on the velocity @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional version of the one - block model was recently considered @xcite and a richer dynamics was found , including a chaotic regime where stick - slip events occur intermittently amidst creep .    in this paper we present a detailed study of a 2d one - block model for earthquakes , in which the block rests upon a moving planar surface and is connected by springs to two perpendicular rigid walls , with a velocity - weakening friction force acting between the slider and the surface .",
    "an earlier discussion on this model was reported by ryabov and ito @xcite .",
    "here we give a much more complete analysis and present several novel and surprising results .",
    "we show that in the limit of very slow pulling the model is governed by three dimensionless parameters , namely , the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 corresponding to the ratio between the two spring constants , a parameter @xmath1 governing the decrease of friction with velocity , and the direction @xmath2 of the pulling velocity . depending on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the model displays three possible generic regimes : i ) pure creep ; ii ) pure stick - slip motion ; and iii ) a mixed regime where both creep and stick - slip occur . in each of these cases ,",
    "the long - time dynamics ( fixed point , periodic orbit or chaos ) is starkly dependent on @xmath2 , as we will see below .",
    "the model we consider consists of a block of mass @xmath3 connected to motionless walls by two springs of stiffness @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ modelinho]a .",
    "the position of the block is described in a system of coordinates @xmath6 fixed to the spring supports , with the origin being placed at the point where the elastic force vanishes .",
    "the block rests upon a surface that moves with a constant velocity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "there is friction between the block and the moving surface , so that initially the block moves with the substrate until the elastic force @xmath9 overcomes the static friction force @xmath10 , at which point the block slips with respect to the surface . in the slip phase of the motion , we adopt a commonly used velocity - weakening friction law @xcite , in which the magnitude of the friction force @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the relative velocity of the slider with respect to the surface , @xmath14 is a typical velocity scale for the friction force , and @xmath15 .     where the elastic force equals the static friction .",
    "starting in a point inside @xmath16 , the block is dragged by the surface along the direction @xmath2 of the pulling velocity until it hits a point on @xmath16 , whereupon slip begins .",
    "the angle @xmath17 denotes the direction opposite to the elastic force at this point.,title=\"fig : \" ]   where the elastic force equals the static friction . starting in a point inside @xmath16 ,",
    "the block is dragged by the surface along the direction @xmath2 of the pulling velocity until it hits a point on @xmath16 , whereupon slip begins .",
    "the angle @xmath17 denotes the direction opposite to the elastic force at this point.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the remainder of the paper we work with non - dimensional quantities , where we have rescaled the length and time scales by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and velocities by @xmath20 . in these units ,",
    "the dimensionless parameters characterizing the problem are the pulling velocity @xmath21 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath22 , and the friction parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the dimensionless characteristic velocity of the friction .",
    "if we now denote by @xmath16 the curve of maximum displacement , where the condition @xmath25 is verified , it then follows that @xmath16 corresponds ( in dimensionless units ) to the ellipse @xmath26 ; see fig .",
    "[ modelinho]b . starting from relative rest at a point",
    "inside @xmath16 , the block will be dragged by the surface until it reaches a point on @xmath16 , upon which the block starts to slide . in the slip phase",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath27 where the angle @xmath28 gives the direction of the friction force .",
    "these equations represent two coupled ( nonlinear ) oscillators , and in this sense the system is somewhat similar to the two - block model considered in ref .",
    "our 2d one - block model is , however , qualitatively richer in that it contains a new parameter , namely , the direction of the pulling velocity which strongly affects the dynamics of the system , as we will see shortly .    a final caveat about the model concerns the choice of direction of the friction force .",
    "the problem comes about because at the onset of motion the friction force is opposite to the elastic force , whereas during the slip phase of the motion the friction force is expected to point in the direction opposite to the relative velocity . since the elastic force is not in general collinear with the velocity , we should thus prescribe a mechanism that allows the switching of direction of the friction force . here",
    "we follow ryabov and ito @xcite and assume that in the acceleration phase of the block motion , the direction @xmath29 of the friction force is chosen according to the following rule @xmath30   \\label{friction}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the directions of the relative velocity and the elastic force , respectively , and @xmath33 is a parameter describing the ` memory ' of the friction force .",
    "( the qualitative behavior of the model does not depend on the value of @xmath33 and so we have used @xmath34 throughout the paper . ) in the deceleration phase , the friction force is kept opposite to the velocity to ensure that the block always comes to a stop .    the dynamics of the model described above can be conveniently described in terms of a one - dimensional map . to see this ,",
    "let us first parametrize the curve @xmath16 in terms of the angle @xmath17 defined by the direction opposite to the elastic force with respect to the @xmath35 axis ; see fig .",
    "[ modelinho]b . as a function of @xmath17 ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath36 of a point on @xmath16 are given by the following parametric equations : @xmath37 .",
    "now suppose that the block starts to slip from a given point on @xmath16 labeled by @xmath17 .",
    "the block will slide for a while until it eventually comes to a stop with respect to the moving surface .",
    "after this , the block sticks to the surface and is brought back to another point @xmath38 on @xmath16 , where a new slip cycle begins , and so on .",
    "thus , the overall dynamics of the model can be described by a one - dimensional map @xmath39 .",
    "obviously the mapping function @xmath40 can not be computed explicitly since this entails solving ( [ eq : modela ] ) and ( [ eq : model2 ] ) during the slip phase of the motion .",
    "however , for a given set of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath21 , the map @xmath40 can be easily constructed on the computer @xcite .",
    "we begin the analysis of our model by considering the early stages of a slip event .",
    "suppose that the block , as it is being dragged by the moving surface , reaches a point @xmath41 where relative motion begins .",
    "at the onset of slip the block will move in the direction of the elastic force @xmath42 , while the friction force will act in the opposite direction . in order to study the nature of the ensuing motion , we linearize the equations of motion in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the elastic force . to accomplish this",
    ", it is convenient first to switch to the reference frame where the substrate is at rest and then write the equations of motion in the coordinates @xmath43 , defined as the block displacement in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the elastic force , respectively .",
    "the resulting linearized equations are @xmath44 where @xmath45 we see from ( [ eq : model4 ] ) that in the limit @xmath46 the transversal coordinate @xmath47 can grow only if so does the component @xmath48 .",
    "we can thus set @xmath49 in ( [ eq : model3 ] ) , so that the linear equation for the variable @xmath48 becomes @xmath50    equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) for the case @xmath51 was studied in great detail by one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that in the limit that @xmath52 the system undergoes a phase transition at @xmath53 in the following sense : for @xmath54 there is only creep , meaning that the linear approximation is always valid and the amplitude of a slip event vanishes as @xmath52 , whereas for @xmath55 one has stick - slip motion in which case the slip amplitude remains finite as @xmath52 .",
    "these results can be trivially extended to the general case given in ( [ eq : lin ] ) . here",
    "the critical point is reached when the condition @xmath56 is satisfied , so that if @xmath57 we have creep , while for @xmath58 stick - slip occurs . note , however , that since the parameter @xmath59 depends on the point @xmath36 where the slip was initiated , it follows that for a critical point to exist the ellipse defined by the critical condition @xmath60 must intersect the curve @xmath16 .",
    "if such an intersection occurs , then the model displays both creep and stick - slip , otherwise the motion is either pure creep or pure stick - slip , as described next .     of maximum displacement ( solid line ) and the critical ellipse ( dashed line ) .",
    "we have @xmath61 in ( a ) and @xmath62 in ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ] of maximum displacement ( solid line ) and the critical ellipse ( dashed line ) .",
    "we have @xmath61 in ( a ) and @xmath62 in ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ]    _ pure creep _ : @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the critical ellipse @xmath60 is inside @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ ellipse]a ) , so that @xmath64 for any point @xmath65 , and hence the linear approximation ( [ eq : lin ] ) always holds ( in the limit @xmath52 ) .",
    "the long - time dynamics of the system is quite simple and can be easily described in terms of the map @xmath39 introduced above .",
    "let us define by @xmath2 the direction of the pulling velocity .",
    "then for any initial condition the block will reach the fixed point @xmath66 , where the elastic force is opposite to @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ ellipse]a ) , so that the resulting motion is essentially one - dimensional creep : starting from the point on @xmath16 labeled by @xmath67 , the block slides a very small distance along the direction of the elastic force , stops , and then is brought back to the same point @xmath67 , and so on .     in terms of the control parameter @xmath2 . in",
    "( a ) we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , corresponding to the creep and stick  slip regime , and the dashed line denotes the critical point @xmath71 .",
    "the inset shows the initial part of the bifurcation diagram , with the solid straight line representing the @xmath72 line . in ( b ) we have stick - slip only with @xmath68 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in terms of the control parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in ( a ) we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , corresponding to the creep and stick  slip regime , and the dashed line denotes the critical point @xmath71 .",
    "the inset shows the initial part of the bifurcation diagram , with the solid straight line representing the @xmath72 line .",
    "in ( b ) we have stick - slip only with @xmath68 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74.,title=\"fig : \" ]    _ creep and stick - slip _ : @xmath75 .",
    "in this situation the critical ellipse and @xmath16 intersect each other at four critical points @xmath76 , where @xmath77 ; see fig .",
    "[ ellipse]b . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 is restricted to the first quadrant , so that for @xmath78 we have creep ( @xmath79 , whereas for @xmath80 stick - slip occurs ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath81 the creep fixed - point @xmath66 is the only attractor .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , where we plot the initial part of the bifurcation diagram for the map @xmath40 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath2 as the control parameter . in this inset ,",
    "the dashed line represents the critical point @xmath71 and we see that for @xmath82 the fixed point indeed follows closely the @xmath72 line ( solid straight line ) , with the small deviation being caused by the finite value of @xmath83 that smoothes out the transition from creep to stick - slip . as @xmath2 increases past @xmath84 , the system remains in a stick - slip fixed point for awhile but eventually undergoes a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations leading to chaos , as seen in the main bifurcation diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a . for larger @xmath2",
    ", the system behaves intermittently @xcite in the following sense : the block spends a long time in the creep region ( below the dashed line ) until it eventually crosses the critical point @xmath84 , after which it undergoes a large slip event and is reinjected back into the creep region , and so on . finally , as @xmath2 approaches @xmath85 there is a reverse period - doubling cascade back to a fixed point .     for the pure stick - slip regime .",
    "@xmath86 denotes the region with a stable fixed point , @xmath87 indicates regions of period-@xmath88 orbits , and the shaded areas represent chaotic regions .",
    "here we used @xmath68 and @xmath74 . ]    _ pure stick - slip _ : @xmath89 . here",
    "the critical ellipse is exterior to @xmath16 and so we have @xmath58 for any point on @xmath16 , hence the block always undergoes stick - slip motion . as the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 are varied ( with @xmath1 fixed ) , the system now displays a very rich behavior that is summarized in the _ phase diagram _ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] , whose main features we shall briefly discuss .",
    "first we see that for small values of @xmath2 the system always reaches a stable fixed point ( region labeled by @xmath86 ) , where slip events occur periodically . as @xmath2 increases ( with @xmath0 fixed ) ,",
    "what follows next depends on the value of @xmath0 . for @xmath0 very close to 1",
    "the fixed point remains stable for all values of @xmath2 ; see bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "however , for larger @xmath0 the fixed point eventually goes unstable and a orbit of period two is born ( region @xmath90 ) .",
    "the fate of this period-2 orbit , as @xmath2 increases further , also depends on the value of @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath91 , the system simply undergoes a reverse period - doubling bifurcation back to the fixed point . for intermediate values of @xmath0 , say , @xmath92 , one observes a full period - doubling cascade leading to chaos ( shaded region ) , followed by a reverse cascade . for larger @xmath0 , windows of periodic orbits and their associated cascades appear inside the chaotic region .",
    "several of these windows are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] , although we have labeled only the first three of them , namely , the windows of period 3 , 4 , and 5 . note also that depending on the value of @xmath0 the secondary period - doubling cascades may not develop fully .",
    "an example of this is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b where we show the bifurcation diagram for the map @xmath40 with @xmath68 and @xmath73 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a two - dimensional one - block model for earthquakes that shows a very rich behavior and is able to reproduce a host of relevant dynamical regimes such as creep , stick - slip ( periodic and chaotic ) and intermittent stick - slip amidst creep .",
    "particularly interesting is our finding that the dynamics of the model is strongly dependent on the direction of the pulling velocity .",
    "this property thus suggests that , in addition to the friction force acting on a fault and the stiffness of the loading system , the direction of shear might also play an important role in determining the fault seismic activity ( or lack thereof ) .",
    "such mechanism could perhaps help explaining , for instance , why different segments of a fault system may exhibit distinct seismic patterns although they presumably have similar geophysical properties .",
    "these are interesting possibilities that certainly deserve to be investigated further .",
