    "modified theories of gravity have recently attained much attention to explore the dark energy ( de ) and late accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "dark energy is almost equally distributed in the universe and different models have been developed in the last decade to describe its nature .",
    "dark energy is related with the modification of einstein gravity in such a way that it would give the gravitational alternative to de .",
    "the modified theories of gravity explain the unification of dark matter and de , deceleration to acceleration epochs of the universe , description of hierarchy problem , dominance of effective de , which help to solve the coincidence problem , viability of de models through energy conditions and many more @xcite .",
    "the proposed modified theories of gravity include gauss - bonnet gravity with @xmath6 invariant @xcite , @xmath3 takes ricci scalar @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath4 inherits torsion scalar @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath0 with @xmath2 as the trace of stress - energy tensor @xcite , @xmath7 carries both @xmath1 and @xmath6 @xcite etc .",
    "these theories use their corresponding invariant and scalars in order to meet the acceleration of the expanding universe .    in alternative theories ,",
    "the @xmath3 theory has shown significant progress in cosmology .",
    "this theory can directly be achieved by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath1 by @xmath3 as an arbitrary function in the einstein - hilbert action @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is the determinant of the metric coefficients .",
    "this theory uses levi - civita connection having only curvature for its formation and admits @xmath11 type terms in the lagrangian to discuss the expanding universe with acceleration .",
    "following the same strategy , the @xmath4 theory of gravity is obtained by replacing torsion scalar @xmath2 with a general function @xmath4 in the action of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath12 this theory uses weitzenbck connection which has only torsion but no curvature .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe in @xmath4 theory is remarked with @xmath2 formed by the tetrad field .",
    "the unification of @xmath3 and @xmath4 gravity theories as @xmath0 is the prospective and interesting version in modified theories .",

    "the @xmath0 theory of gravity incorporates all the properties of its constituent gravities .",
    "this theory is considered as an important gravitational theory which represents the evolution of the universe .",
    "myrzakulov @xcite constructed different reductions of @xmath0 gravity and derived some torsion scalar solutions , in particular , the exact de sitter solution by assuming a particular model @xmath13 .",
    "he concluded that these exact analytic solutions describe the evolving universe in phantom acceleration phase .",
    "chattopadhyay @xcite found a quintom - like behavior and transition from deceleration to acceleration phase of the universe using the same model with interacting ricci de in this theory . also , the statefinder parameters indicate that the model interpolates between dust and @xmath14cdm phases of the universe .",

    "@xcite explored energy conditions in @xmath0 gravity with @xmath2 as trace of the energy - momentum tensor for two specific models .",
    "they found that for some values of the input parameters of the models , the de sitter and power - law solutions may be stable with the validity of energy conditions .    in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "we provide preliminaries related to the energy conditions and @xmath0 gravity .",
    "section * 3 * is devoted to represent the general form of the energy conditions in @xmath0 gravity and their reduction to @xmath3 and @xmath4 theories of gravity .",
    "also , the graphical behavior of the constraints on the model parameters is shown .",
    "the last section summarizes the results .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the energy conditions and their cosmological implications in gr as well as in modified theory of gravity .",
    "the energy - momentum distribution and stress due to matter or any other non - gravitational field is described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 . for a realistic matter source satisfied by all states of matter and non - gravitational fields",
    ", it must satisfy some conditions on this tensor .",
    "there are several different types of these conditions , so called energy conditions such as averaged energy conditions ( depend on the average stress - energy tensor along a desirable curve ) and point - wise energy conditions ( count the stress - energy tensor at a given point in the space ) etc .",
    "the standard point - wise energy conditions are the null ( nec ) , weak ( wec ) , strong ( sec ) and dominant energy condition ( dec ) .",
    "basically these conditions are formulated with the help of raychaudhuri equation that describes the behavior of timelike , spacelike or lightlike curves of a congruence and attractiveness of the gravity @xcite .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for timelike and spacelike curves is given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the ricci tensor , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the timelike and lightlike tangent vectors , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the shear and vorticity tensors describing the distortion of volume and rotation of the curves respectively .",
    "the expansion scalar @xmath22 shows the expansion of volume , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the positive parameters which represent the curved of the congruence under spacetime manifold .",
    "the quadratic terms in raychaudhuri equation may be neglected for small distortions of the volume without rotation , leading to @xmath25    the expansion scalar , @xmath26 , provides the attractiveness property for any hypersurface of orthogonal congruence @xmath27 yielding @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the framework of gr , through the einstein field equations ,",
    "the ricci tensor is replaced by the engery - momentum tensor @xmath15 , which leads to point - wise energy conditions .",
    "taking into account the perfect fluid ( @xmath30 ) with energy density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 in the effective gravitational field , these energy conditions are classified as follows .",
    "the * nec * is the consequence of @xmath33 , which leads to familiar form @xmath34 .",
    "the nec implies that density of the universe falls with its expansion and its violation may yield the big rip of the universe .",
    "it ensures the validity of second law of black hole thermodynamics . the positivity condition for timelike vector @xmath18 results the * sec * which reduces to @xmath35 in the effective field .",
    "the violation of this condition represents the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the * wec * requires the positivity of the energy density for any observer at any point , i.e. , @xmath36 in addition to nec .",
    "the hawking - penrose singularity theorems require the validity of sec and wec .",
    "the condition on energy that it must not flow faster than light @xmath37 yields one inequality of * dec * whose complete set is @xmath38 .",
    "the wec and nec are the most important of all energy conditions as their violation lead to the violation of other energy conditions .",
    "this procedure is trivially true for @xmath3 gravity .",
    "however , for any other theory , the replacement of the energy - momentum tensor should be taken under consideration .",
    "it may not affect the procedure if nec is satisfied for any matter and is maintaining by the physical motivation of geodesic congruences .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation and attractiveness property hold for any gravitational theory , and hence can be used to check the energy conditions of the recently developed modified theories of gravity .",
    "there is an equivalent role treated by both curvature and torsion scalars in the fundamental framework",
    ". it should not be surprising that such a comparability between curvature and torsion should be found in the construction of the gravitational lagrangian of the theory .",
