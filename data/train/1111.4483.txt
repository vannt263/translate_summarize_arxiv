    "the detection of neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) represents the most exciting frontier of low - energy neutrino ( @xmath3 ) astronomy . even though galactic sne are rare , perhaps a few per century , the existing large underground neutrino detectors and the numerous planned ones increase the confidence that a high - statistics sn neutrino signal will be eventually observed .",
    "such a detection would provide a plethora of astrophysical information on the sn explosion mechanism , and could offer a handle on particle physics such as @xmath3 masses and mixings , too ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in particular , the flavor conversions occurring deep inside the star could leave an imprint on the observable sn neutrino burst .",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to possible signatures of the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein  ( msw ) effect  @xcite with the ordinary matter in the stellar envelope  @xcite . moreover , in recent years it has been realized that in the deepest sn regions the neutrino density is so high that the neutrino - neutrino interactions  @xcite dominate the flavor evolution in a highly non - trivial way ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the general result of these studies is that rapid conversions between different flavors are possible and can occur collectively , i.e. in a coherent fashion for many modes over large energy ranges .",
    "unfortunately , the occurrence of these effects is strongly dependent on the original sn emission features , which makes a _ general _ characterization of the observable sn neutrino spectra at earth in terms of the original ones a formidable task ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) . at the moment we are still far from a complete understanding of this complex flavor - dynamics .",
    "however , _ the lack of a complete understanding _ should not be confused with _ a complete lack of understanding_. in fact , for some conditions / regimes a relatively robust comprehension has been achieved .",
    "this is _ not _ the case , unfortunately , for the long - time cooling phase ( postbounce time @xmath4  s ) . in principle",
    ", rich time- and energy - dependent collective dynamics may be present there  @xcite , on the top of which peculiar time - dependent modification of the flavor content of the flux could be induced by msw effects associated to the shock - wave propagation in the stellar envelope  @xcite . since our current understanding suggests that the resulting neutrino spectra depend on many poorly understood details , sharp predictions for the flavor evolution are very challenging if not impossible at present .",
    "furthermore , during the cooling phase all neutrino flavors originate close to the neutron star surface , where the material is very neutron rich , suppressing charged - current reactions for @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , one expects that the luminosities and spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 become quite similar , making it much harder to see flavor oscillation effects at all in the dominant @xmath5 channel , which is currently the optimal one .",
    "this is due to the fact that all large existing and near - future detectors primarily see inverse beta decay events @xmath7 .",
    "the relative similarity of @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra seems to be in fact qualitatively confirmed by recent 1d long - time simulations  @xcite .    in order to direct future searches and experimental perspectives ,",
    "a more robust strategy is to focus on the early phase of the sn neutrino signal , in a time window where relatively robust expectations exist for the neutrino emission spectra and for the flavor dynamics .",
    "the largest difference among the flavor fluxes arises during the first 1020 ms after bounce when the outer layers of the collapsed core deleptonize , leading to the prompt @xmath8 burst . since negligible @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "fluxes are emitted during this phase , self - induced oscillations are simply absent : collective effects do not give rise to any flavor transformation during the neutronization burst  @xcite  .",
    "additionally , at these early times , since the shock wave stalls at low radii close to the neutrinosphere , the msw flavor transitions occurring at larger radii would essentially probe the static sn progenitor profile .",
    "in this situation , the characterization of the flavor conversions is straightforward and , since the model predictions for the energy and luminosity of the burst are fairly robust , the observation of the burst gives direct information about the survival probability of @xmath8 and then on the mixing parameters  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a strong suppression of the @xmath8 burst would be a smoking gun for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh : @xmath11 ) in the case of a `` large '' @xmath12 leptonic mixing angle ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , as currently measured by the daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite reactor experiments . these recent measurement confirm and",
    "greatly strengthen the significance of early hints suggested by the long - baseline @xmath14 experiments  @xcite and double chooz reactor experiment  @xcite , especially when analysed in combination with other oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "however , with current `` @xmath5 sn detectors '' , such effects are challenging - to - impossible to detect , and one has to invoke future mton - class water cherenkov detectors  @xcite or large liquid - argon time projection chambers  @xcite , to achieve enough sensitivity to these @xmath8 signal features .    on the other hand ,",
    "the subsequent phase of mass accretion , characterized by a typical postbounce timescale @xmath15 of @xmath2(100 ) ms , represents a particularly interesting possibility for detecting signatures of flavor transformations also in the accessible @xmath5 channel ( see  @xcite for a discussion in the context of sn1987a ) .",
    "first of all , one can more easily afford to simulate these early stages with sufficiently realistic neutrino transport than the longer timescales of later cooling phases .",
    "also , the neutrino signal properties are largely independent of the detailed mechanism of the explosion ( and actually of the question whether an explosion takes place at all ) , since the revival of the shock wave has yet to take place .",
    "all modern simulations available indicate that the neutrino fluxes as well as the flavor - dependent flux differences are large in this phase , with a robust hierarchy for the neutrino number fluxes , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 indicates the non - electron flavors .",
    "moreover , it has been recently realized  @xcite that the net electron densities @xmath18 reached above the neutrinosphere in realistic sn models exceed the neutrino density @xmath19 , significantly suppressing the development of the self - induced neutrino oscillations according to the `` multi - angle matter suppression '' mechanism first described in  @xcite .",
    "the matter suppression ranges from complete ( when @xmath20 ) to partial ( when @xmath21 ) , producing in principle intriguing time - dependent features . using as benchmark the results of the hydrodynamical sn simulations of the basel / darmstadt group for different iron - core sn models  @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite found complete matter suppression for postbounce times @xmath22  s , and partial flavor conversions for @xmath23  s. this result has been independently confirmed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "more recently , in a work based on a iron - core sn model from the garching group complete matter suppression has been found for all the duration of the accretion phase  @xcite .",
    "when the matter suppression is complete , the @xmath3 signal will be processed only by the usual msw effect in the sn mantle with the static progenitor profile . in this situation ,",
    "the characterization of the sn neutrino signal results is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the presence of a `` large '' @xmath1 mixing angle one expects significant differences in the observable @xmath5 flux for the two mass hierarchies  @xcite .",
    "the diagnostic power of this observable has been given relatively little attention so far : the hierarchy discrimination power in icecube was briefly addressed as side goal in  @xcite , which appeared when our work was in progress , but with inadequate simulations and no discussion of the model - dependence , as we shall comment later . on the other hand",
    "the relatively model - independent flavor difference in rise time behaviour was already visible ( limited to the first 20 ms ) in the early study  @xcite , but its potential diagnostic power was not explored there .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we devote our work to a characterization of the early sn neutrino lightcurve signal in the largest current neutrino detector for such a purpose , namely the icecube cherenkov detector in the ice at the south pole .",
    "we shall focus in particular on observables sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "we show how the analysis of the neutrino lightcurve during the accretion phase may be a powerful tool to probe the neutrino emission features and the mass hierarchy in the likely case the mixing angle @xmath1 is not too small .",
    "we substantiate and quantify our idea with an extensive scan via monte carlo simulations .",

    "all calculations were performed with the equation of state ( eos ) of lattimer & swesty  @xcite , with a bulk incompressibility modulus of 180  mev and symmetry energy of 29.3  mev for nuclear matter .",
    "this would eventually imply a cold neutron star maximum mass of nearly 1.85 m@xmath26 . at face value , this is at odds with the recent mass determination of @xmath27  m@xmath26 from the millisecond pulsar j1614 - 2230 observation  @xcite .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that constraints on the eos derived from neutron star masses and radii apply to the _ cold _ eos , which are not `` per se '' representative of the conditions of _ hot _ , more isospin - symmetric sn matter , whose description may be thus accurate with the currently used eos . also , in order to fulfill the above - mentioned constraint , the lattimer & swesty eos with incompressibility modulus of 220  mev can be applied , which gives a cold neutron star maximum mass of 2.05  m@xmath26 . in sn simulations , both eos  based on 180 and 220  mev  result in essentially indistinguishable evolutionary conditions during the first @xmath28100  ms after core bounce , which is the time window we are interested in .",
    "differences obtained applying the eos with incompressibilities of 180 and 220  mev might become more prominent only during the later post - bounce evolution if the neutron star mass is close to the limiting mass of the eos ( see the useful study  @xcite ) . a more extended and up - to - date discussion of this point can be found in ref .",

    "[ fig1 ] .    during the early postbounce accretion phase",
    "all investigated sn models have a common feature , which they also share with results published in refs .",
    "@xcite : the luminosity of heavy - lepton neutrinos and antineutrinos ( henceforth collectively denoted by @xmath17 ) rises to its maximum level faster than that of electron antineutrinos @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath29 and @xmath17 in contrast to @xmath8 are not emitted in any significant amounts during the core - collapse phase until core bounce .",
    "instead , their vivid production sets in only when the bounce shock starts to heat swept - up material to high temperatures .",
    "this allows nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung to become efficient and positrons to appear so that electron - positron annihilation can also take place .",
    "these processes become more and more important as the temperature rises and the electron degeneracy drops as a consequence of the deleptonization triggered by the prompt @xmath8 burst .",
    "the production of @xmath29 is more strongly suppressed than that of @xmath17 during the first @xmath2820ms after bounce because of the high degeneracy of electrons and @xmath8 , which are present in very large numbers before and during the emission of the deleptonization burst by @xmath33 annihilation and @xmath34 captures on neutrons is not efficient . moreover , since in the optically thick regime @xmath8 are in chemical equilibrium with the matter their degeneracy also blocks the phase space for the creation of @xmath29 via nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung . ] .",
    "this was already visible in  @xcite .",
    "the steep initial increase of the @xmath17 luminosity is followed by a relatively abrupt termination of this growth at a value of typically a few @xmath35  erg / s ( for a single kind of heavy - lepton neutrino ) , considerably ( almost a factor of two ) below the peak luminosity reached by @xmath29 more gradually about 0.1  s later . during this phase",
    ", the emission of @xmath8 and especially @xmath29 grows thanks to their highly efficient production via charged - current processes ( electron and positron captures on free nucleons ) in the matter that forms a thick , hot mantle around the newly born proto - neutron star after having been accreted through the standing bounce shock .",
    "the transition from a growing / plateau phase to a decreasing luminosity depends on the core structure of the collapsing star and the corresponding shallow decline of the mass - infall rate with time and thus varies with the progenitor : in the models considered it varies from about 0.1 to 0.3 s. a faster luminosity drop sets in when the density and thus mass accretion rate decreases more abruptly .",
    "this can be associated with , e.g. , the infall of an interface between progenitor shells containing different chemical compositions or with the onset of the explosion , which quenches further accretion .",
    "small oscillatory behaviors superimposed on the main trend in luminosities visible in fig .  [ fig1 ] reflects the back- and forward propagating bounce shock , which in turn leads to an oscillating mass - accretion rate behind the sn shock .",
    "while the production of @xmath8 and @xmath29 in the hot accretion layer is very important , heavy - lepton neutrinos are created exclusively by neutral - current pair processes , i.e. , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung as well as electron - positron and @xmath8-@xmath29 pair annihilation .",
    "consequently , heavy - lepton neutrinos are thermally less strongly coupled to the stellar medium .",
    "their main production occurs deeper inside the newly born proto - neutron star and additional contributions from the accretion layer are less significant .",
    "therefore @xmath17 escape effectively from a layer with smaller radiating surface and their luminosity remains lower than that of electron - flavor neutrinos ( since the emission is approximately blackbody - like , the luminosity @xmath36 scales with the neutrinosphere radius @xmath37 and temperature @xmath38 roughly like @xmath39 ) . the temporal evolution of the @xmath17 luminosity after the peak depends on two factors , which in combination have a complex influence on the evolution of temperature and radius of the corresponding neutrinosphere : ( a ) the contraction behavior of the core of the nascent proto - neutron star and ( b ) the growing thickness of the surrounding accretion layer in response to the continuous infall of matter from the collapsing progenitor star . on the one hand a more massive accretion layer compresses the proto - neutron star core but at the same time leads to higher temperatures , therefore not only enhancing the @xmath8 and @xmath29 emission but also the @xmath17 luminosity of more massive progenitors . on the other hand the core contracts faster also for a softer nuclear equation of state .",
    "therefore , both the different stellar progenitors ( with a different structure of their iron core and surrounding regions ) and the different equations of state have some consequences for the properties and evolution of the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the postbounce accretion phase .",
    "it is important to note that outside the radius where pair - production processes have essentially ceased ( at the so - called `` energy - sphere '' ) , @xmath17 still diffuse through an overlying layer of opaque matter , in which they scatter frequently off neutrons and protons before they can escape freely at their `` transport - sphere '' .",
    "although the energy transfers from high - energy @xmath17 to the nucleons of the cooler environment by individual scatterings are small , the cumulative effect of many scattering reactions adds up to a noticeable down - grading in energy space of @xmath17 that finally stream off the transport - sphere ( for a detailed discussion , see ref .",
    "the corresponding spectral changes are accounted for , since the effects of nucleon recoil and thermal motions ( as well as weak - magnetism corrections ) are included in the treatment of neutrino - nucleon interactions ( see appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    differently from the spherically symmetric ( 1d ) cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the observable neutrino luminosities and mean energies predicted by multi - dimensional sn simulations exhibit short - time variations with considerable amplitudes during the postbounce accretion phase .",
    "this is connected to the presence of large - scale asymmetries as a consequence of hydrodynamic instabilities in the layer between proto - neutron star surface and stalled bounce shock .",
    "these lead to time - dependent hot spots and anisotropic neutrino production in the cooling region of the settling accretion flow .",
    "such effects were discussed in detail for axially symmetric ( 2d ) models in refs .",
    "@xcite and for 3d models in ref .",
    "apart for these subleading features , there is no significant qualitative difference in multidimensional simulations .      in summary , numerical simulations of core - collapse sne",

    "[ fig2 ] . ) in this time window of the pre - explosion phase the non - radial mass motions connected to hydrodynamical instabilities ( i.e. hot - bubble convection and the standing accretion shock instability ) found in multi - dimensional sn models have still to grow to their full strength  @xcite .",
    "indeed , comparing the neutrino luminosities and mean energies of the 15 @xmath53 1d model of fig .  [ fig2 ] with the corresponding quantities for the 15 @xmath53 2d model in fig .  6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one realizes that during the early accretion phase only minor differences arise between these two cases .",
    "therefore , the 1d sn models we will use for our study are sufficient for an accurate characterization of the neutrino signal and of the sn matter density at early postbounce times . we will show this explicitly in sec .  4 where we will compare our results for 1d and 2d sn models .",
    "this similarity between 1d and 2d results also simplifies the neutrino flavor conversion physics , as explained in the following section .",
    "the emitted sn neutrino flux is processed by self - induced and msw oscillation effects during its propagation .",
    "the self - induced effects would take place within @xmath54  km from the neutrinosphere whereas the msw transitions take place at larger radii , in the region @xmath55@xmath56  km .",
    "as the self - induced and msw effects are widely separated in space , they can be considered independently of each other . in the normal mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath57 ) and for the spectral ordering of the accretion phase , no self - induced flavor conversion will occur . instead , in inverted mass hierarchy ( ih , @xmath58 ) potentially large self - induced effects",
    "could be expected  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown using results both from basel / darmstadt group simulations and garching group ones  @xcite that the trajectory - dependent multi - angle effects associated with the dense ordinary matter suppress collective oscillations in actual models of iron - core sne , as expected when large trajectory - dependent phase dispersion are induced by the matter would suppress the collective phenomena  @xcite .    in principle , depending on the electron density , the matter suppression can be complete , when @xmath59 , or partial when the matter dominance is less pronounced .",
    "forward - peaked angular distributions of the neutrino field further reduce the effective neutrino - neutrino potential strength and make the effect more prominent . in the following",
    "we will focus on the early time @xmath60(0.2 ) s where the matter density largely exceeds the neutrino density , and hence also completely suppresses the collective oscillations for the cases under investigation , as explicitly checked and confirmed by two independent groups  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the neutrino fluxes can only undergo the traditional msw conversions in sn while passing through the outer layers of the star .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward how to calculate the @xmath29 flux at earth in the different cases  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in nh one finds @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the 12 mixing angle , with @xmath63  @xcite . in ih for `` large '' @xmath1 ( i.e. with @xmath64 ) one",
    "gets @xmath65 while for `` small '' @xmath1 ( i.e. with @xmath66 ) one finds @xmath67 then , it is clear that for `` large '' @xmath1 the @xmath5 flux at the earth is basically reflecting the original @xmath68 flux , if ih is realized , or closely matching the @xmath69 flux , in case of nh . since these two extremes show significant qualitative differences ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , one might hope to be able to distinguish these two possibilities .",
    "we shall see in the next section that this appears to be a promising perspective for neutrino detection at icecube .",
    "note that in principle the signal may be further modified by earth matter effects , whenever the sn is seen through a significant chord crossing the earth , below the horizon .",
    "for the south pole location , the probability for such a crossing has been estimated to be about 40% ( but just 6.4% for a earth core crossing ) see  @xcite . in case of earth `` shadowing '' , the expected variation of signal in the accretion phase was already estimated in  @xcite to few percent at most .",
    "we confirmed with explicit calculations in several instances that the variations of the signal are comparable to this level or smaller , and that to a significant extent they affect the overall normalization and thus are challenging to detect . in any case , these modifications are irrelevant for the type and size of the effects we focus on and will be neglected in the following .",

    "[ fig4 ] , we illustrate the count rate functions @xmath84 and the cumulative functions @xmath85 for the different models considered , with @xmath86 labeling the simulation and @xmath87 ( or in general capital latin letters ) being the index related to the hierarchy , i.e. @xmath88nh ( red , bottom curves ) or @xmath88ih ( blue , top curves ) . in particular , we used the nine 1d sn models shown in fig .  1 and a 2d sn model with a 15 @xmath53 progenitor mass .",
    "note that the difference between the two hierarchies is a _ shape _ difference ( as should be clear already from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , rather than a mere overall difference in average energies , for example , as in some past proposals for sn physical diagnostics .",
    "also note that this difference is quite independent of the progenitor used ( most notably of its mass ) and , in agreement with expectations , do not show a significant dependence from the dimensionality of the simulation either .     and the cumulative functions @xmath89 for the garching set of models ; dashed ( top ) curves denote expectations for ih , solid ( bottom ) curves for nh . in these examples",

    "we choose the so - called @xmath91 metric , so that the distance between the predictions ( always a number between 0 and 1 ) writes : @xmath92}\\ , \\left|k_{i}^{a}(x)-k_{j}^{b}(x)\\right |\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : dist}\\ ] ] this choice is solely dictated by the standard practice in experimental physics to use kolmogorov  smirnov statistic ( which uses that metric ) to test whether two underlying one - dimensional distributions differ .",
    "we emphasize , however , that alternative choices are possible and in fact may lead to better discrimination power .",
    "thus , the following results are to be meant as illustrative .",
    "generically , we find that `` typical '' distances of a model @xmath93 from the models having the same hierarchy ( same `` @xmath87 '' ) but different simulation ( different `` @xmath94 '' ) is smaller than `` typical '' distances from curves having opposite hierarchy ( no matter if with same or different @xmath94 ) .",
    "to quantify this statement , one has to define _ global _ estimators characterizing the distance between a given curve and the whole set of distributions sharing the same or the opposite hierarchy .",
    "for example , we define @xmath95 namely the _ average _ distance computed from all the models or the _ minimum _ distance among all models , either of the different or like hierarchy of the case at hand . note that in the latter case we exclude from the templates the model",
    "we compute the distance from . in principle , both the above functions can be used as hierarchy estimators and of course other choices are possible .",
    "again , we insist on the fact that here we do not look for an optimization of the method , we just report some examples of operational procedures to illustrate its viability . anyway , no matter what indicator for the distances of the curve from the whole set of distributions is used , a natural criterion to establish if a model @xmath93 is indicative of nh or ih is to evaluate wheter its distance estimator with respect to the nh class or ih class of models is smaller .",
    "we thus define the differences @xmath96 whose positive values indicate preference for the  correct hierarchy \" , negative values for the `` wrong hierarchy '' with respect to the hierarchy of the considered model .",
    "note that , as it will happen in practice , we assume that the experimenter has a set of templates to compare a signal with , which however _ does not _ include the correct curve .",
    "also , `` larger '' differences obviously mean more clear separation .",
    "of course if a difference of distances is `` large '' or not is not an absolute concept , but is linked to the experimental resolving power , which in turn is linked both the astrophysical factors ( e.g. sn distance , energetics , etc . ) and to instrumental limitations .",
    "we shall present some quantitative estimates in sec .",
    "[ stat ] and further discuss this point in sec .  [ discussion ] .    in the tables  1 and",
    "2 we report the results of such a computation for the choices @xmath97ms , respectively : for each model ( row index @xmath94 : 40 m@xmath26 , etc . )",
    "we list the estimators assuming either ih ( 2 and 3 columns ) or nh ( last 2 columns ) .",
    "the fact that the differences in the columns are always positive means that no matter which curve we take , it is always closer to one template of the same hierarchy type than to all templates of the opposite one , as well as always closer to the average of the templates of the same hierarchy than to the average of templates of the opposite one",
    ". put otherwise , within the limitations of the sample at our disposal and in the limit of no experimental errors , we can conclude that both estimator are theoretically unambiguous , or that the sets of curves are well separated .",
    ".distance of the simulated model indicated in the first column from the set of models having opposite hierarchy minus the one from those have the same hierarchy .",
    "columns 2 - 3 assume the reference model has ih , columns 4 - 5 that it has nh .",
    "columns 2 and 4 use the estimator defined in eq .",
    "( [ deltamin ] ) , columns 3 and 5 use the estimator defined in eq .  ( [ deltaav ] ) .",
    "the asterisk indicates a 2d simulation .",
    "the table assumes @xmath98100 ms .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabledelta ]    these results clearly show that @xmath99 is a better estimator than @xmath100 : while in all cases one can estimate a reliability of hierarchy attribution better than 99% , by using @xmath100 the reliability improves by at least one order of magnitude  , of course . here",
    "we are not interested to more accurate estimates , given the illustrative purpose of our analysis with no goal of optimization . ] .",
    "actually , the few cases where there is disagreement between the two methods are those where , due to @xmath101 statistical fluctuations , the separation is not too large compared with the statistical error . getting a consistent result with different estimators may thus give a feeling for the statistical robustness of an eventual detection .",
    "additionally , the example above ( and others not shown ) also prove that the exact choice of @xmath102 is not crucial . as a general rule ,",
    "however , one should avoid using a too small or a too large @xmath102 : despite significant separation between expectations , too small values would imply insufficient statistics and do not help ; by choosing too large values of @xmath102 would make less and less reliable the theoretical separation , both because the matter multi - angle suppression effect holds better and better at early times , and because astrophysical details ( e.g. neutrino productions from outer layers of the collapsing stars ) become comparatively more important at later times , especially for the nh case which is more sensitive to the accreting matter properties .",
    "we also note that we implicitly assumed that the `` initial signal time '' is known with negligible error with respect to the rise time shape needed to compute the function space distances . the typical computed error with",
    "which one expects the post - bounce timing of a benchmark sn event to be established in icecube is of about @xmath103ms at 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "we estimated that this should translate into an uncertainty in the distances comparable with the width induced by statistical fluctuations ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and thus smaller than the model - to - model variation .",
    "since our analysis suggests that this is not expected to be the limiting factor in the discrimination , a fortiori we can guess that this should remain true when accounting for the error on the post - bounce time determination .",
    "this is also reasonable from a graphical inspection of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the bin size is of 2 ms .",
    "a future improvement over the present analysis would be to perform a simultaneous determination of the post - bounce time and the rise time shape , combining the output of analyses like  @xcite and the present one .",
    "this kind of development will be needed for assessing for example what is the maximal distance out to which a sufficiently clear separation between the two hierarchies can be achieved , with a more complete account of the detector performance . in the same spirit",
    ", another improvement may be to include elastic scattering events on electrons , which here ( as in most of the literature , see for example as  @xcite ) have been neglected since its cross - section is sub - leading by about two orders of magnitude with respect to the inverse - beta decay one .",
    "the hierarchy discrimination power using a much more sophisticated simulation of the detector was recently estimated as a side result in  @xcite .",
    "no quantitative comparison with our results is however possible , since the simulations used in  @xcite only included one outdated fe - core collapse model ( from livermore group  @xcite ) and two o - ne - mg progenitors from the garching group . as we commented in the introduction ,",
    "o - ne - mg progenitors are poorly suitable for hierarchy determination ( having a short accretion phase , smaller differences between flavors , and suffering from a difficult assessment of collective effects ) ; this expectation is in broad agreement with results of  @xcite , obtained however under over - simplified assumptions for the flavor evolution . on the other hand the livermore model , apart for showing qualitatively that fe - core progenitors are more promising than o - ne - mg ones and that they might allow a significant discriminations power up to distance of 10 kpc or so ( consistently with what illustrated here ) can not be trusted at a quantitative level due to the lack of microphysics of sufficiently sophistication , compared with present state - of - the art .",
    "note also that the `` right model signal shape '' was assumed to be known in  @xcite , while in this article we show that discrimination should be possible also relaxing this assumption in a statistical sense .",
    "an important issue is how dependent this signature is from theoretical uncertainties , most notably the progenitor structure , equation of state , and numerical schemes .",
    "the set of models considered here provide quite a satisfactory test that the uncertainties associated with progenitor structure do not spoil the viability of the method . on the other hand ,",
    "a firm conclusion on the other uncertainties requires further studies and goes beyond our present goals . in the following , however , we make some comments .",
    "the eos dependence explored in  @xcite at very early times seems to be quite moderate .",
    "we also argued in sec .",
    "[ qualdisc ] that we do not expect significant changes within current uncertainties , at least for the early accretion phase .",
    "additionally , the knowledge about the eos has been progressing rapidly , both theoretically and observationally ( see e.g.  @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "it is thus unclear to what extent the residual uncertainty in models compatible with all constraints _ at the time of next sn detection _ will hamper the viability of these diagnostics .",
    "note that the neutrino lightcurve itself at later times may be used to constrain the equation of state ( see e.g.  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .    concerning numerical model dependence , we had at our disposal also three simulations of the basel / darmstadt group ( for details of their sn modeling , see  @xcite ) for 10.8 , 15 and 18 m@xmath26 progenitors , using the physics input described in ref .",
    "@xcite . a similar analysis as the one described in sec .",
    "4 shows that the physical effect studied here ( @xmath104 signal rises faster than the @xmath105 one ) is always present , and differences between the nh and ih cases appear even more clearly , both due to more energetic @xmath104 and more sudden rise of their luminosity .",
    "however , we can not compare these simulations directly with those of the garching group since only the latter apply a treatment of weak interactions including nucleon thermal motions , weak magnetism corrections , and energy transfer in nucleon recoils . on the other hand , tests performed by both groups demonstrate that inclusion of nucleon recoil effects lead to lower @xmath104 energies as well as a slower luminosity rise , in the direction of reconciling the differences .",
    "note that applying identical input physics to core - collapse sn simulations , both basel / darmstadt and garching results agree qualitatively and quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "for sure , it is known that an accurate treatment of issues like general relativity and neutrino - nucleon scatterings is needed to have reliable quantitative predictions of the observables : this is illustrated for example by figs .  6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as by figs .  3 and 4 of the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "for the time being , we can tentatively conclude that the simulations of the basel / darmstadt group and the results presented in the recent paper  @xcite confirm _ qualitatively _ the generality of the feature discussed here , but extra work will be required to establish wether this agreement also holds quantitatively , namely if the mild spread due to progenitor structure found in the simulations of the garching group provides a reasonable estimate of the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we explored the chances of neutrino mass - hierarchy diagnostics by the @xmath0 signals during the ( early ) accretion phase of iron - core sne , of the order of 100 ms or so .",
    "as already visible in some old simulations  @xcite , temporal profiles of @xmath104 and @xmath105 fluxes appear quite different in the accretion phase , and relatively model - independent : in particular , the @xmath104 signal rises faster than the @xmath105 one .",
    "we have explored the feasibility of using this observable for neutrino mass hierarchy determination in icecube , which should provide an exquisite high - statistics determination of the lightcurve of a galactic sn . for not too small values of @xmath1 favoured by recent data ,",
    "the potentially `` clean '' theoretical interpretation of the measurement in terms of a given hierarchy is a consequence of the suppression of collective oscillations at early postbounce times by matter multi - angle effects and of the following evolution being dictated by msw transitions .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the expected time profiles for ten different simulations carried out by the garching group .",
    "we found that a _ shape _ difference in the rise time curve between the ih and nh cases is quite independent of the progenitor used ( most notably of its mass ) ; it does not appear that there is a major dependence from the dimensionality of the simulation either .",
    "we also showed with extensive monte carlo simulations that the expected statistical error is small if compared to the typical differences found between the two classes of models ( nh vs. ih ) and should not provide the limiting factor for diagnostics for typical distances , spectra and energetics of a galactic core - collapse sn .    while extra investigations are needed to assess quantitatively the `` theoretical errors '' , i.e. the dependence of the signature discussed here on the equation of state , numerical schemes , etc .",
    "( see sec .  [ discussion ] for a brief discussion ) , in several other respects",
    "our analysis has been conservative .",
    "for example , diagnostic potential might be increased by optimizing the statistical estimators , of which we introduced here a few examples .",
    "further improvement in the diagnostic power may be obtained by constraints on the spectral properties of the signal , either at existing cherenkov detectors like super - kamiokande or even via modest spectral sensitivity at icecube or ( more likely ) at its upgrades  @xcite : models inconsistent with the measured spectrum might be excluded and reduce the theoretical error .",
    "also , other complementary techniques have been proposed to extract information on the mass hierarchy from sn neutrino signals , the most notable one being through spectral modulations induced via earth matter effect ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the interesting point is that , different from the earth effect , the signature discussed here appears to be independent of a serendipitous position of the detector at the arrival time of the sn signal .",
    "we checked in fact that the signal is only altered on a negligible level of percent when the sn is observed throughthe earth .",
    "also , differently from shock effects , it is independent of poorly understood details of the flavor evolution in the sn during the complex cooling phase . on the other hand ,",
    "_ if observed _ , signatures like the earth matter effect are less worrisome in terms of model dependence . additionally ,",
    "if a complementary detector of @xmath8 s was available  @xcite , one might hope to cross - check the preferred solution ( ih or nh ) from rise time information with the inference on the hierarchy from the detection or absence of the neutronization burst  @xcite . in general , any megaton class detector with flavor and energy resolution",
    "will of course improve the chances of both astrophysics and physics diagnostics .",
    "it is also expected that when the next galactic sn will eventually occur , the simulations will be calibrated to reproduce that particular event : informations on the progenitor should allow a reduction in the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the arguments developed in this article confirm once more the high physics potential of sn neutrinos in shedding light on the still unknown pieces of the neutrino mass and mixing framework .",
    "we hope that the potential importance for physical diagnostics of the signature discussed here will motivate further attention and progress in numerical simulations . therefore , even though a galactic sn explosion is a rare event , we are sure that the patient waiting will eventually be rewarded with a bonanza of information .",

    "<S> the rise time of a galactic supernova ( sn ) @xmath0 lightcurve , observable at a high - statistics experiment such as the icecube cherenkov detector , can provide a diagnostic tool for the neutrino mass hierarchy at `` large '' 1 - 3 leptonic mixing angle @xmath1 . thanks to the combination of matter suppression of collective effects at early postbounce times on one hand and </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the ordinary mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect in the outer layers of the sn on the other hand , a sufficiently fast rise time on @xmath2(100 ) ms scale is indicative of an inverted mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate results from an extensive set of stellar core - collapse simulations , providing a first exploration of the astrophysical robustness of these features . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for all the models analyzed ( sharing the same weak interaction microphysics ) the rise times for the same hierarchy are similar not only qualitatively , but also quantitatively , with the signals for the two classes of hierarchies significantly separated . </S>",
    "<S> we show via monte carlo simulations that the two cases should be distinguishable at icecube for sne at a typical galactic distance 99% of the times . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a preliminary survey seems to show that the faster rise time for inverted hierarchy as compared to normal hierarchy is a qualitatively robust feature predicted by several simulation groups . </S>",
    "<S> since the viability of this signature ultimately depends on the quantitative assessment of theoretical / numerical uncertainties , our results motivate an extensive campaign of comparison of different code predictions at early accretion times with implementation of microphysics of comparable sophistication , including effects such like nucleon recoils in weak interactions . </S>"
