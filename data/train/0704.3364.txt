    "here , we report on new scanning squid microscope measurements , and we also further analyze some of the hall bar measurements , showing that , if they exist , the local fields at the surfaces and edges of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 single crystals are much smaller than those expected at the surfaces and edges of a chiral p - wave superconductor .    although @xmath8 pairing symmetry is fully gapped , specific heat , @xcite nuclear relaxation rate , @xcite and thermal conductivity measurements @xcite all show a power law temperature dependence , suggesting the presence of line nodes . among other suggestions",
    ", one possibility is that the @xmath9 band , the band with the primary contribution to superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , has nodeless @xmath8 pairing symmetry , but induces superconductivity with a line of nodes in the other ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) bands .",

    "the issue of the broken time reversal symmetry in the superconducting state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , aside from intrinsic interest , has taken on new urgency with several proposals for error tolerant quantum logic elements taking advantage of this property .",
    "@xcite    there are useful analogies between a chiral @xmath7 superconductor and a ferromagnet.@xcite a single domain ferromagnet has a uniform magnetization which is equivalent to the field produced by a current sheet circulating around the surface , in the appropriate geometry , while a single domain @xmath12 superconductor carries an intrinsic angular momentum of @xmath13 per cooper pair,@xcite which one would expect to lead to an actual surface current sheet , confined within a healing length proportional to the coherence length of the surface.@xcite however , the field generated by this current must be screened inside the superconductor by a diamagnetic shielding current flowing within the penetration depth of the surface , so that @xmath14 inside the superconductor .",
    "the net result is a spontaneous magnetization within the healing length plus the penetration depth of the sample edges , which is greatly reduced from that expected from the simple ferromagnetic analogy , but which is still substantial and , using parameters appropriate to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , predicted to give rise to local fields as large as 1mt under certain assumptions.@xcite the superconductor can also support domains in which regions of @xmath12 coexist with regions of @xmath15 order .",
    "although the net magnetization vanishes at the boundaries between such domains , the local fields , which extend over the penetration depth on either side of the wall , can be as large as 2mt.@xcite other than direct phase sensitive measurements , the detection of such fields would be one of most direct confirmations of a superconducting order parameter with time reversal symmetry breaking since the spontaneous boundary and domain wall supercurrents are expected by symmetry@xcite and would have no other obvious explanation .",

    "muon spin resonance observed internal fields which are roughly consistent with the predicted values.@xcite if these observed fields are due to internal domain walls , it suggests that the surface currents must be reduced by two or more orders of magnitude from their bulk values if the domains are larger than 10 microns .",
    "it is difficult to imagine what could so strongly reduce the surface fields at the ab surface due to domain boundaries .",
    "the surface screening effects are small ; the surfaces are cleaved ; and roughness even to the depth of a hundred angstroms or so will not substantially reduce the fields detected at the hall probe or squid .",
    "this suggests that domains intersecting the ab plane are either so sparse as to not have been scanned or are smaller than a few microns .",
    "another possibility is that the domains intersecting the ab surface are shallow , with a depth along the c - axis noticeably less than the penetration depth . in this case",
    ", the spontaneous currents and fields could be too weak and spread out in the ab layers to be detected .",

    "the samples used for the squid measurements on these faces were polished and afm imaging on typical samples show them to be smooth to 5 nm ( rms).@xcite ms assumed specular scattering from the edge in which case one component of the order parameter is suppressed while the other component is slightly enhanced . for diffuse scattering from a rough edge",
    ", both components will be suppressed and this will reduce the surface currents and resulting magnetic fields .",
    "although self - consistent calculations have not been carried out for this case , the effect of surface roughness on the two component order parameter has been studied,@xcite and one finds that the two components heal over quite different length scales .",
    "using ginzburg - landau and london theory to estimate the resulting change in the surface magnetization , one finds that , even for completely diffuse scattering from a rough surface , the reduction in surface magnetization is less than 30%.@xcite    domain walls cost energy because they disrupt the superconducting order . unlike a ferromagnet",
    ", there is no balancing of this energy due to dipolar forces because spontaneous screening currents ensure that the magnetic field , or local magnetization , is zero inside the superconductor .",
    "therefore , in principle , a single domain @xmath12 superconductor is possible .",
    "however , domains will naturally form as the sample is cooled through @xmath72 and as extended objects , these domains are susceptible to pinning by defects and impurities in the sample . therefore",
    ", one expects domains to be present although their density may be controlled by sample purity and slow cooling in a field .",
    "muon spin resonance experiments were interpreted as evidence for dilute domains,@xcite kerr effect measurements suggested domain sizes in the range of 50 to 100 microns,@xcite while the first phase sensitive josephson tunneling measurements are consistent with no domains ( or a small even number of domain walls between opposing faces of the crystal).@xcite on the other hand , more recent josephson tunneling measurements were interpreted as evidence for dynamic domains of @xmath31 micron on average,@xcite although one would extract larger domain sizes if finite domains perpendicular to the c - axis were included in the modelling .",
    "all of these measurements , except for muon spin resonance , would see reduced signals if the domain size along the c - axis becomes small and this would affect the measurements reported here as well . unless the fields at domain walls are reduced by more than an order of magnitude in size from the predicted values , the hall bar measurements suggest domain sizes of either less than 1.5 microns in size over the ab face or large enough that no domain wall fell in the 100@xmath73100 @xmath4 m scan area .",
    "earlier work has reported that large domains can be flipped by fields of the order of a mt or larger@xcite and that small surface domains are influenced by fields @xmath74t.@xcite while the data presented here was taken on samples cooled in fields less than 2.5@xmath4 t , hall data taken on samples cooled in up to a mt was very similar to that shown here except for the presence of more trapped vortices.@xcite in principle , very fast domain wall motion could result in zero time - averaged edge current and zero time - averaged domain wall current .",
    "however , previous experiments@xcite suggest that the domain wall motion would be slow on our experimental time scale , which is 10 secconds per line scan for the scanning squid microscope data shown here .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that dynamic behavior of the domains prevents the observation of the signal in this experiment .    in conclusion ,",
    "scanning magnetic microscopy measurements place quite severe limits on the size of edge currents and/or on domain sizes in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the different experimental results taken as evidence for @xmath12 pairing come to quite different conclusions about domain sizes .",
    "since there are now detailed predictions for the field profile in the vicinity of domain walls in the bulk , muon spin resonance could now , in principle , provide detailed information about the validity of these predictions as well as quantitative information about the density of domains in the bulk .",
    "in addition , either slow muons@xcite or beta - nmr@xcite could be used to probe the surface region and to look for fields due to spontaneous edge currents as well as domains near the surface .",
    "scanning magnetic microscopy is still one of the most direct probes of domains intersecting the surface and of edge currents and further improvements in sensitivity may either confirm or rule out their existence .",
