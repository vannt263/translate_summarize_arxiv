    "direct measurement of the @xmath7 gauge boson couplings is possible through study of @xmath0 production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath12 tev .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian  @xcite , invariant under @xmath13 , for the @xmath7 interaction contains four coupling parameters , cp  conserving @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and cp  violating @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cp  conserving parameters are related to the magnetic dipole ( @xmath18 ) and electric quadrupole ( @xmath19 ) moments of the @xmath4 boson , while the cp  violating parameters are related to the electric dipole ( @xmath20 ) and the magnetic quadrupole ( @xmath21 ) moments : @xmath22  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the @xmath7 couplings at the tree level are uniquely determined by the @xmath6 gauge symmetry :  @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 the direct and precise measurement of the @xmath7 couplings is of interest since the existence of anomalous couplings , i.e.  measured values different from the sm predictions , would indicate the presence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "a @xmath7 interaction lagrangian with constant , anomalous couplings violates unitarity at high energies , and , therefore , the coupling parameters must be modified to include form factors ( e.g.  @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the square of the invariant mass of the @xmath4 and the photon , @xmath30 is the form factor scale , and @xmath31 for a dipole form factor )  @xcite .",
    "the study of the @xmath1 production in @xmath2 collision is also an important test of the sm description of gauge - boson self - interactions .",
    "since the photon does not couple directly to the @xmath5 in the sm , this study is sensitive to anomalous couplings beyond the sm .",
    "the most general @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) vertex function is characterized by a set of four coupling parameters @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "all these coupling parameters vanish at tree level within the framework of the sm .",
    "the couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 conserve cp , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are cp - violating . similarly to the @xmath7 anomalous couplings , the @xmath37 couplings must be regulated by generalized dipole form factors : @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the low energy ( @xmath40 ) limit for the couplings , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 here the values for @xmath45 were chosen so that the unitarity is preserved and that all terms in the matrix element proportional to @xmath39 have the same asymptotic energy behavior . at the tevatron ,",
    "the @xmath0 production is insensitive to the form factor effects for @xmath46 a few 100 gev , whereas the form factor effects can not be ignored for @xmath1 production due to the higher power of @xmath29 dependence in the @xmath47 vertex function .",
    "we present studies of the @xmath7 and @xmath37 couplings based on @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 events observed with the cdf  @xcite and d  detector  @xcite during the 19921993 run of the fermilab tevatron collider , corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath51 for cdf and @xmath52 for d .",
    "the @xmath53 events contain the @xmath0 production process , @xmath54 followed by @xmath55 , and the radiative @xmath56 decay where the photon originates from bremsstrahlung of the charged lepton .",
    "anomalous coupling parameters enhance the @xmath0 production with a large @xmath29 , and thereby result in an excess of events with high transverse energy , @xmath57 , photons , well separated from the charged lepton .",
    "the @xmath58 events contain the radiative @xmath59 decay , the direct @xmath1 production where the photon is radiated from one of the annihilating quarks , and the possible @xmath1 events due to the anomalous @xmath5-@xmath60 couplings .",
    "the presence of the @xmath5-@xmath60 couplings will also be signaled by an excess of @xmath5 production with high @xmath57 photons .",
    "since the good detection of the photon is the key to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements , we briefly review how photons are detected by the cdf and ddetectors .",
    "a photon is identified as a calorimeter energy cluster satisfying the following condition . a calorimeter cluster",
    "must ( i ) have a high electromagnetic energy fraction ; ( ii ) be isolated ; ( iii ) have shower shape consistent with a single photon ; and ( iv ) have no tracks pointing to it .",
    "table 1 summarizes the actual conditions required by cdf and d .    to test shower shape of",
    "the cluster cdf uses the central electromagnetic strip chambers  @xcite ( ces ) placed after @xmath61 radiation lengths in the central electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the ces determines shower position and transverse development of an electromagnetic shower at shower maximum by measurement of the charge deposition on orthogonal , fine - grained ( 1.5  cm spacing ) strips and wires .",
    "d  tests both longitudinal and transverse shower shapes including correlations between energy deposits in the fine - grained calorimeter cells  @xcite .",
    "the d  electromagnetic calorimeter module has 4 longitudinal layers .",
    "each of layers 1 , 2 and 4 is segmented transversely to @xmath62 , while the third layer , which typically contains @xmath63 of the em energy , has segmentation of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is the pseudorapidity defined as @xmath66 , @xmath67 being the polar angle with repect to the beam axis .",
    "@xmath68 is the azimuthal angle . )",
    "both cdf and d  found that the detection efficiency for photons depends on @xmath69 due to the isolation requirement .",
    "d  found its cluster shape requirement also results in the @xmath57 dependence .",
    "the overall photon detection efficiency was obtained by combining this @xmath57dependent efficiency with the probabilities of losing a photon due to @xmath70 pair conversions and due to an overlap with a random track in the event .",
    "table 2 summarizes the photon detection efficiencies at cdf and d .",
    ".summary of photon detection at cdf and d [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     similarly to the @xmath0 analysis , limits on anomalous @xmath1 couplings were obtained by a fit to the @xmath69 spectrum .",
    "figure 6 shows the current cdf and d  @xmath71 limit contours for anomalous @xmath8 couplings together with the limits from l3  @xcite experiment and the constraints from @xmath72-matrix unitarity for @xmath73 .",
    "the pair of @xmath74 and @xmath75 is cp  conserving , while that of @xmath76 and @xmath77 is cp  violating .",
    "limits on cp  conserving @xmath8 couplings are : + @xmath78 + @xmath79 + at the @xmath71 confidence level .",
    "limits on @xmath9 couplings are the same to within 0.1 .",
    "the sensitivity of limits to the form factor scale , @xmath80 , was studied .",
    "both cdf and d   data reach the limit set by unitarity for @xmath81 , which can be interpreted as the sensitivity limit from the current data .",
    "in conclusion , cdf and d  has studied @xmath0 and @xmath1 productions at @xmath12 tev in electron and muon channels .",
    "the observed photon @xmath57 spectra agree well with the standard model predictions , yielding limits on anomalous @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath82 couplings .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the members of the organizing committee , u.  baur , s.  errede and t.  m@xmath83ller , and the conference staff for running the conference so smoothly .",
