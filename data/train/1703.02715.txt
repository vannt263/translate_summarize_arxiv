    "in this section , we review the literatures that study the impact of the media connections and media networks on financial and economic matters . on the top of that , we make a comparison between the media connection and other pairwise measures , such as simple correlation and distances , and we show that by looking at the stocks from a network angle , the media will provide us more soft information beyond just media coverage and news tones , e.g. interrelations , centrality , and determinants .    media connection , by definition , is a connection that built via news stories which may through explicit mentions or implicit affections .",
    "the explicit mentions , also known as media co - occurrence , is the most natural way of formulating the connectivity of two entities . @xcite",
    "first studied the social network inferred from the co - occurrence network of reuters news .",
    "they show that the network exhibits small - world features with power law degree distribution and it provides a better prediction of the ranking on  importance \" of people involved in the news comparing to other algorithms .",
    "@xcite studied the cross - predictability of stock returns by identifying the economic linkage from co - mentions in the news story .",
    "they constructed a linkage signal using the weighted average of the connected stock returns and they find that the linked stocks cross - predict one another s returns in the future significantly , and the predictability increases with the number of the connected news .    apart from the explicit mentions , the connection may also be built through implicit affections .",
    "one of the most popular channels is the industrial chain . as shown in @xcite , economic links among certain individual firms and industries",
    "contribute significantly to cross - firm and cross - industry return predictability .",
    "@xcite extends the perspective of @xcite by defining a connection between industries with the predictability of returns . through these industrial interdependencies ,",
    "the news that conveys information on one industry will also percolates into the other industries .",
    "further , due to the competitive relation of stocks within the industry , the good ( bad ) news to one stock will be bad ( good ) news to its competitors .",
    "in addition , business interaction is another important channel that transfers news information from one firm to another .",
    "based on media connections , we can formulate a media network by taking the whole picture of the connected stocks as a connected graph with news tones tagged on each stocks .",
    "the inter - relationships between stocks are presented by the aggregated connection scores .",
    "different from correlation , the connection score is only a measure of concurrent relationship , which does not depend on the outside information . to see that",
    ", we consider the following example : suppose there are two connected news for two stocks , and the news tones for each stock is given by : @xmath1 where a positive number indicates a positive news tone for this stock . by cross - section correlation",
    ", we will have the correlation between the stocks is -1 .",
    "however , this is not true .",
    "as we can see , the news tones for these stocks are all positive in both news , which may indicates a positive co - movement relationship .",
    "therefore , correlation coefficient is not a proper tool for describing the news connectivities based on this simple example .",
    "as simple correlation fails in describing media connections , people may come up with euclidean distance .",
    "however , distance is incapable of capturing the sentiment information in news tones , and the following example explains our point . @xmath2 for above cases , the euclidean distance informs us that the distance between these two pairs of stocks are the same .",
    "however , we can deduce that the prices of stock 3 and 4 are likely to be co - moving while the prices of stock 1 and 2 may be affected oppositely . as a result , a proper connection score that can correctly reflect the relationship between connected stocks based on the news tones is needed , and we will show that our construction of connection scores will be able to retain the information given in the news completely in the next section .",
    "in this section , we introduce the data sources and explain the methodology for constructing the media connection index . beyond that",
    ", we further explains the differences between the average correlation index in @xcite and the advantages of our measure over theirs .",
    "the data we use for identifying media connection is the firm - specific news from the thomson reuters news archive dataset ranging from jan-1996 to dec-2014 .",
    "the data contains various types of news , e.g. reviews , stories , analysis and reports etc .",
    ", about markets , industries and corporations . in this paper",
    ", we identify the news that has mentioned at least two stocks as connected news and the others as self - connected news .",
    "this dichotomy allows us to isolate the effect of the media connection by calculating the connectivity measure with one stock as the centre of a news network , and the aggregation of connectivity measures over the whole portfolio will provide information on the whole news network .",
    "the information that the news conveys only affects the directly connected stocks .",
    "the aggregated news tones reflect the majorities opinions on future prices of both connected stocks .",
    "the media connection is identified though the connected news where at least two stocks are mentioned in the text . beyond just connectivity ,",
    "the thomson reuters news data also provide us the news tones ( positive , negative and neutral ) for each mentioned stocks within each article . on the top of that",
    ", we can compute the daily pairwise connection scores of the news to each stock mentioned , that is , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total number of stocks in the sample , the superscript @xmath5 denotes the @xmath5th news in day @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the total number of news of day @xmath6 which may vary everyday . by construction ,",
    "the connection score is positive when the news tones of the stocks are the same which indicates a possible co - movement of the stock prices .",
    "further , the magnitude of the connection score implies the strength of the connection which ranges from -1 to 1 . with a higher magnitude , the connection of the two stocks will be tighter and a more synchronized movement will occur .    with these basic elements available , we construct the _ media connectivity matrix _ on daily basis @xmath8 by construction , the media connectivity matrix have included all the information that a media network can provide us , and it is different with news coverage and average correlation in several aspects .",
    "firstly , the off - diagonal elements in the matrix provides us the information on the closeness of each stocks on the news tones while the diagonal elements inform us the degree of self - connection .",
    "further , despite the news may debate on the effects of some events happened to certain stocks , the aggregation of the connection score will reflect the opinions of the majority and therefore make the right prediction of the co - movement .",
    "this property differs from the correlation , and can be seen from the following example .",
    "assume that    based on the connnectivity matrix , we finally aggregate the network information to compose a _ media connection index _ ( mci ) on daily basis , @xmath9 this formulation frees us from the effect of media coverage and just measures the fraction of the media connections scaled by the news tones , which proxies the media interaction between the stocks . in figure [ fig - ret - corr",
    "] , we plot both media connection index we constructed and the average correlation index by @xcite from 1996 to 2014 .",
    "@xmath10\\ ] ]    from the figure we can observe that our index behaves in the same trend with average correlation index in general .",
    "this indicates that our media network index shares some information in average correlation .",
    "furthermore , media network index is more volatile that average correlation index during the recession periods while maintaining the same fluctuation as average correlation over expansion periods .",
    "this nice feature is driven by the soft information that involved in the media news and it distinguishes our media based measure with price based measures .",
    "apart from the media news data , we also collect 12 economic predictors that are linked directly to economic fundamentals from amit goyal s website for comparison purposes .",
    "specifically , they are the log dividend - price ratio ( d / p ) , log dividend yield ( d / y ) , log earnings - price ratio ( e / p ) , log dividend payout ratio ( d / e ) , stock return variance ( svar ) , book - to - market ratio ( b / m ) , treasury bill rate ( tbl ) , long - term bond yield ( lty ) , long - term bond return ( ltr ) , term spread ( tms ) , default yield spread ( dfy ) , default return spread ( dfr ) . the basic summary statistics of these predictors are reported in table [ tab - summary ] .",
    "@xmath11\\ ] ]    from the summary statistics we can observe that the monthly excess market return has a mean of 0.66% and a standard deviation of 5.32% , implying a monthly sharpe ratio of 0.12 . while the excess market return has little autocorrelation , most of other variables are quite persistent .",
    "the summary statistics are generally consistent with the literature .",
    "in this section , we provide a number of empirical results .",
    "section [ subsecfcst ] examines the predictability of media network index and average correlation index on the aggregate market .",
    "section [ subsececn ] compares the media network index with economic predictors .",
    "section [ subsecoos ] analyzes the out - of - sample predictability , section [ subsecass ] assesses the economic value of predictability via asset allocation and section [ subsecport ] investigates the predictability of characteristics portfolios .",
    "consider the standard predictive regression model , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the excess market return , i.e. , the monthly log return on the s&p 500 index in excess of the risk - free rate .",
    "@xmath15 is the change of media network index based on optimism score .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the change of media network index based on positive ( negative ) score . for comparison",
    ", we also construct average correlation measure according to @xcite , @xmath18 .",
    "the null hypothesis of interest is that media connection has no predictive ability , @xmath19 . in this case , ( [ eqreg1 ] ) reduces to the constant expected return model , @xmath20 .",
    "as finance theory suggests a negative sign of @xmath21 , we test @xmath22 against @xmath23 , which is closer to theory than the common alternative of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25\\ ] ]    table [ tab - prednews ] reports the results of the predictive regression .",
    "panel b provides the estimation results for the average correlation index ( @xmath18 and @xmath26 ) . consistent with @xcite , @xmath18 positively predicts future stock returns , which means when systematic risk increases , risk - averse investors require a higher risk premium to hold aggregate wealth , and the equilibrium expected return must rise .",
    "however , we do not observe a significant negative effect from @xmath26 on future return . according to @xcite ,",
    "if an increase in average correlation is due to an increase in aggregate risk , then the discount rate for future expected cash flows on most assets , including the stock market , should increase as well .",
    "holding expected future cash flows constant , higher future expected returns will induce an immediate fall in price , i.e. , negative realized returns , or volatility feedback , as described by @xcite .",
    "therefore , if stocks are more correlated with each other , volatility feedback will generate negative stock returns on average .",
    "indeed , we use @xmath15 to proxy the change of aggregate risk and find it negatively predict future stock returns significantly . with the standard ols estimation , @xmath15 has an estimated coefficient of -0.85 that is statistically significant at the 5% confidence level .",
    "economically , the ols coefficient suggests that a one - standard deviation increase in @xmath15 is associated with a 0.85% decrease in expected excess market return for the next month . on the one hand , recall that the average monthly excess market return during our sample period is only 0.66% ,",
    "thus the slope of 0.85% implies that the expected excess market return based on @xmath15 varies by about 1.3 times larger than its average level , which indicates a strong economic impact . on the other hand ,",
    "if we annualize the 0.85% decrease in one month by the multiplication of 12 , the annualized level of 10.2% is somewhat large . in this case",
    ", one may interpret this as the model implied expected change that may not be identical to the reasonable expected change of the investors in the market .",
    "empirically , this level is comparable with conventional macroeconomic predictors .",
    "for example , a one - standard - deviation increase in the d / p ratio , the cay and the net payout ratio tends to increase the risk premium by 3.60% , 7.39% , and 10.2% per annum , respectively ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath0 of @xmath15 with ols forecast is 2.53% , which is substantially greater than 1.16% of @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that if this level of predictability can be sustained out - of - sample , it will be of substantial economic significance ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite show that , given the large unpredictable component inherent in the monthly market returns , a monthly out - of - sample @xmath0 of 0.5% can generate significant economic value and our findings in section [ subsecoos ] are consistent with this argument .    to figure out the driving force of the predictability",
    ", we also calculate media connection index based on negative and positive tones and re - estimate model ( [ eqreg1 ] ) respectively .",
    "we find that the main prediction power of media connection index is from negative tone whose @xmath6-statistic is -2.02 with @xmath0 being 1.80% while the positive tone has no significant prediction power on future returns .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite who assert the negative tone is more informative than the positive tone , and our findings complete their argument in the media network aspect .",
    "apart from just analyse the predictability over the whole period , it is also important to analyse the predictability during business - cycles to gain a better understanding about the fundamental driving forces . following @xcite , we compute the @xmath0 statistics separately for economic expansions ( @xmath27 ) and recessions ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is an indicator that takes a value of one when month @xmath6 is in an nber expansion ( recession ) period and zero otherwise ; @xmath32 is the fitted residual based on the in - sample estimates of the predictive regression model in ( [ eqreg1 ] ) ; @xmath33 is the full - sample mean of @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 is the number of observations for the full sample .",
    "note that , unlike the full - sample @xmath0 statistic , the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) have no sign restrictions .",
    "columns 4 and 5 of table [ tab - prednews ] report the @xmath27 and @xmath28 statistics .",
    "it is shown that @xmath15 gains a higher the return predictability over recessions while @xmath18 is higher over expansions , and this suggests that media news may reflect some soft information that is different from stock prices .",
    "summarizing table [ tab - prednews ] , the change of media network index , @xmath15 exhibits significant in - sample predictability for the monthly excess market return both statistically and economically , which is much stronger than the average correlation index .",
    "in addition , media network index performs much better in the recession periods while average correlation outperforms during the expansions .",
    "this suggests that media news reflects different information from stock prices for predicting market returns .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the forecasting power of media network index @xmath15 with economic predictors and examine whether its forecasting power is driven by omitted economic variables related to business cycle fundamentals or changes in investor risk aversion .",
    "basically , we ask the question whether the forecasting power of @xmath15 remains significant after controlling for economic predictors . to analyse the marginal forecasting power of @xmath15 , we conduct the following bivariate predictive regressions based on @xmath15 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath36 is one of 12 economic predictors described in section [ secmethod ] , and our main interest is the coefficient of @xmath15 , @xmath21 , and to test @xmath22 against @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath38\\ ] ]    table [ tab - predecon ] shows that the estimates of @xmath21 in ( [ eqreg3 ] ) are negative and large , in line with the results of predictive regression ( [ eqreg1 ] ) reported in table [ tab - prednews ] .",
    "more importantly , @xmath21 remains statistically significant when augmented by the economic predictors .",
    "these results demonstrate that @xmath15 contains sizeable complementary forecasting information beyond what is contained in the economic predictors .",
    "meanwhile , average correlation index loses its prediction power after controlling for all 3 media connection indices , suggesting that news based predictor is more informative than aggregate risk measure .      despite that the in - sample analysis provides more efficient parameter estimates and thus more precise return forecasts by utilizing all available data , @xcite , among others ,",
    "argue that out - of - sample tests seem more relevant for assessing genuine return predictability in real time and avoid the over - fitting issue .",
    "in addition , out - of - sample tests are much less affected by finite sample biases such as the stambaugh bias ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is essential to investigate the out - of - sample predictive performance of media network index .    for out - of - sample forecasts at time @xmath6 , we only use information available up to @xmath6 to forecast stock returns at @xmath39 .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , and many others , we run the out - of - sample analysis by estimating the predictive regression model recursively based on different measures of media connection indices , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the ols estimates from regressing @xmath43 with model [ eqreg1 ] recursively . like our in - sample analogues in table [ tab - prednews ] , we consider the media network indices based on optimism , positive and negative news tones respectively . for comparison purposes , we also carry out out - of - sample test with @xmath18 and @xmath26 , and the results are reported in panel b of table [ tab - oos - cycle ] .    to evaluate the out - of - sample forecasting performance , we apply the widely used @xcite @xmath44 statistic , the @xcite @xmath6-statistic modified by @xcite , and the @xcite msfe - adjusted statistic .",
    "the @xmath44 statistic measures the proportional reduction in mean squared forecast error ( msfe ) for the predictive regression forecast relative to the historical average benchmark .",
    "@xcite show that the historical average is a very stringent out - of - sample benchmark , and individual economic variables typically fail to outperform the historical average . to compute @xmath44 ,",
    "let @xmath45 be a fixed number chosen for the initial sample training , so that the future expected return can be estimated at time @xmath46 .",
    "then , we compute @xmath47 out - of - sample forecasts : @xmath48 .",
    "more specifically , we use the data over 1996:01 to 2000:12 as the initial estimation period so that the forecast evaluation period spans over 2001:01 to 2014:12 .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the historical average benchmark corresponding to the constant expected return model ( @xmath20 ) , i.e. @xmath51 by construction , the @xmath44 statistic lies in the range ( @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 , it means that the forecast @xmath54 outperforms the historical average @xmath14 in terms of msfe .",
    "the second statistic we report is @xcite statistic modified by @xcite ( dm - test hereafter ) , which tests for the equality of the mean squared forecast errors ( msfe ) of one forecast relative to another .",
    "our null hypothesis here is that the historical average has a msfe that is not greater than that of the predictive regression model .",
    "however , to compare a predictive regression forecast with the historical average entails comparing nested models , as the predictive regression model reduces to the historical average under the null hypothesis .",
    "@xcite shows that the modified dm - test statistic follows a non - standard normal distribution when testing nested models , and provides bootstrapped critical values for the non - standard distribution .",
    "the third statistic is the msfe - adjusted statistic of @xcite ( cw - test hereafter ) .",
    "it tests the null hypothesis that the historical average msfe is not greater than the predictive regression forecast msfe against the one - sided ( right - tail ) alternative hypothesis that the historical average msfe is greater than the predictive regression forecast msfe , corresponding to @xmath55 against @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite show that the test has a standard normal limiting distribution when comparing forecasts from the nested models . intuitively , under the null hypothesis that the constant expected return model generates the data , the predictive regression model produces a noisier forecast than the historical average benchmark as it estimates slope parameters with zero population values .",
    "we thus expect the benchmark model s msfe to be smaller than the predictive regression model s msfe under the null . the msfe - adjusted statistic accounts for the negative expected difference between the historical average msfe and predictive regression msfe under the null , so that it can reject the null even if the @xmath44 statistic is negative .",
    "@xmath57\\ ] ]    panel b of table [ tab - oos - cycle ] shows that the return based @xmath18 and @xmath26 index generates a negative @xmath44 statistic ( -9.92 and -7.73 respectively ) and thus delivers a higher msfe than the historical average .",
    "indeed , the estimation difference between price based measures and historical average are not significant according to both dm- and cw - test statistics .",
    "thus , @xmath18 and @xmath26 have weak out - of - sample predictive ability for the aggregate stock market , confirming our previous in - sample results ( table [ tab - prednews ] ) . in the contrary ,",

    "besides , @xmath15 seems not performing well during expansions in comparison with @xmath17 , which also support @xcite that negative tone is more informative than positive tone of media news .    @xmath58\\ ] ]    since both @xmath18 and @xmath15 can be proxy of aggregated market risk , their economic sources of predictability are likely the same . to understand their differences in forecasting power , figure [ fig - csfe1 ]",
    "depicts the predicted returns based on @xmath18 and @xmath15 for the 2001:012014:12 out - of - sample period .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath15 predicted returns are much more volatile than the @xmath18 forecasts . as the actual realized excess returns ( plotted in the figure as 6-month moving average for better visibility ) are even more volatile than the @xmath15 predicted returns .",
    "this explains why the media news based index does a better job than the return based correlation approach here in capturing the expected variation in the market return .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , figure [ fig - csfe2 ] presents the time - series plots of the differences between cumulative squared forecast error ( csfe ) for the historical average benchmark forecasts and the csfe for predictive regression forecasts based on @xmath15 and @xmath18 over 2001:012014:12 .",
    "this time - series plot is an informative graphical device on the consistency of out - of - sample forecasting performance over time .",
    "when the difference in csfe increases , the model forecast outperforms the historical average , while the opposite holds when the curve decreases .",

    "<S> * etc . ) . as quoted in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S>  a corporate news event likely affects not only the firm at the centre of the particular development but also a number of other companies with economic ties to the firm \" . </S>",
    "<S> undoubtedly , this argument addresses the importance of economic linkage in being a channel for media news to take effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , what if the media news itself can form a linkage and serve as the intermediate for information to spread among firms ? </S>",
    "<S> consider an example that a piece of news mentions two stocks at the same time , and this is always the case in real life . </S>",
    "<S> this news , in fact , not only just conveys knowledge of media coverage , but also informs us there is a media linkage between these two stocks . </S>",
    "<S> this linkage , on the one hand , may indicate a possible price co - movement reflected by the soft information of news tones ; on the other hand , it may also lead to investors additional attention on attached stocks . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize these two effects as soft information comovement and investor sentiment comovement .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we ask the question how market reacts to the change of media connection . here , we use change of media network instead of original index due to news momentum effect ( @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , media news has continuation and may have lead - lag effects on stock returns . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the change of media network index is a more informative measure than the original one . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we expect this index negatively predicts future returns . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> media network reflects soft information about firm fundamentals and hence it shows similar effect as return based comovement measures . according to @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> if aggregate risk increases , then the discount rate for future expected cash flows on most assets , including the stock market , should increase as well . </S>",
    "<S> holding expected future cash flows constant , higher future expected returns induce an immediate fall in price , i.e. , negative realized returns , or volatility feedback , as described by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , if stocks become more highly correlated due to an increase of media connection , volatility feed back generates negative stock returns on average . on the other hand , media news based network index </S>",
    "<S> also show sentiment comovement effect . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , media connection reveals additional attentions from investors , thus driving additional sentiment effect ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) of corresponding stocks . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , given two stocks , a and b , without media connection , share holder a ( b ) may only pay attention to stock a ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , when both firm a and firm b are mentioned by the same news article , this news may draw shareholder a s ( b s ) attention to stock b ( a ) . due to sentiment effect , this additional attention is asymmetry to the good news and bad news . to take shareholder a as an example , if news has a high sentiment on firm b , it drives optimistic of shareholder a and he can simply long stock b to adjust his position . while due to short sell constraint , a pessimistic investor can not short firm b stock when news story show a low sentiment on firm b. in this case , high media connection drives overprice of stock b , hence a lower future return .    on the top of this logic </S>",
    "<S> , we compose a novel media connection index based on media network and news tones to model the change of stock comovement as proxy of change of aggregate risk of the stock market . based on this media connection index , we find that the change of aggregate media connection based on news tones predicts a negative return with a higher in - sample and out - of - sample performance than average correlation index in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we have documented 2.53% and 5.14% monthly in - sample and out - of - sample @xmath0s in ols predictive regressions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our findings are also statistically as well as economically significant even though we control for different economic predictors used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also tested the performance of our index in predicting returns during the recession and expansion periods documented by nber . </S>",
    "<S> the results shows that our measure obtain larger and positive @xmath0s in recession periods comparing to average correlation measure . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find the predictability of our measure mainly comes from the negative new tones which is consistent with @xcite in which he find negative tones are more informative . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we test the portfolio implications of media connection index across different investors with various risk aversion levels as well as different trading strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical results show that the portfolios constructed based on media connection index obtain larger sharpe ratios and certainty equivalent return gains than average correlation for mean - variance investors . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows that the stocks that are distressed ( high book - to - market ratio ) , with high investment or past winners are more predictable by media connections , which indicates a strong predictive power as well .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we shed new light upon a different aspect of media s role in return predictability . in the past decade </S>",
    "<S> , the literature that investigates the media s role in financial markets mainly examines how the pessimism sentiment revealed from the content is associated with stock prices . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite presents that the linguistic tone , especially negative tones , can predict market excess returns . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite further explore the cross - section predictability of returns by processing firm - specific news . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xcite document a sector specific reaction based on their distilled sentiment measure . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite further improves @xcite by using a term weighting method of content analysis based on ols and naive bayes , and they also find significant return predictability of news articles . </S>",
    "<S> unlike these literature that focuses on extracting investors sentiment between the lines , our index is a risk measure based on news tones . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the news tone co - movement provides information about future prices co - movement of stocks that connected by co - occurrence in news articles .    </S>",
    "<S> we also contribute to the literature that studies risk measures for financial markets . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed a risk measure by using average correlations of stock returns . </S>",
    "<S> they find this measure can predict positive monthly as well as quarterly market excess log returns . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite decomposed aggregate market variance into an average correlation component and an average variance component . </S>",
    "<S> they find the latter commands a negative price of risk in the cross - section of portfolios sorted by idiosyncratic volatility . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed a measure for systemic risk by defining marginal expected shortfall with net equity returns . </S>",
    "<S> our measure distinguishes those risk measures by involving soft information and investor sentiment of media news and it confirms our conjectures by showing strong return predictability .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we contribute to the literature on application of network analysis in financial studies . @xcite and @xcite </S>",
    "<S> find that economic links among certain individual firms and industries contribute to cross - firm and cross - industry return predictability . </S>",
    "<S> they interpret their results as evidence of gradual information diffusion across economically connected firms , in line with the theoretical model of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite investigate the predictability of industry returns based on a wide array of industry interdependencies . </S>",
    "<S> most recent , @xcite propose a new method , tail - event driven network risk , to detect risk network . based on this measure , </S>",
    "<S> they provide direct evidence on tail event interdependencies of financial institutions . </S>",
    "<S> some follow - up empirical studies include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most related , @xcite have provide empirical evidence that media news reveals additional linkages among individual stocks . </S>",
    "<S> they find the lagged return of stocks in the linked group according to media news can predict subsequent return of other stocks within the same group . </S>",
    "<S> different from above literature , we are the first paper to construct the market wide network index and provide direct evidence on its market return predictability .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secmedianetwork ] , </S>",
    "<S> we review the literature exploring media connections and media network in financial markets and explain why other measures may fail in capturing stock price co - movement . in section [ secmethod ] , </S>",
    "<S> we show our methodology for composing an aggregate measure of media connection which can overcome the deficit of other measures and describe our data sources . </S>",
    "<S> after that , we conduct some empirical tests and present our results in section [ secemprc ] . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we conclude in section [ secconcl ] . </S>"
