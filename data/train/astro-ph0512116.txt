    "damped lyman - alpha absorption lines in quasar spectra are believed to arise from intervening galaxies and intergalactic matter at various cosmological epochs .",
    "the damped lyman - alpha absorbers ( hereafter dlas ) are classically defined as quasar absorbers with @xmath6(h  i)@xmath7 while absorbers with @xmath8(h  i)@xmath9 are conventionally classified as sub - dlas .",
    "this distinction is based on the observational constraints of an early spectroscopic study @xcite .",
    "since the ly-@xmath10 line shows damping wings even at @xmath6(h  i)@xmath11 in this paper we will refer to both the sub - dla and dlas as dla systems .    at high redshifts",
    "the dlas are believed to contain a large fraction of the co - moving density of neutral hydrogen in galaxies and possibly account for all of the stars visible today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of metallicities in these absorbers provide important probes of the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the universe @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the connection between dlas and galaxies has not been clearly established . to shed more light on this connection ,",
    "it is necessary to complement the wealth of spectroscopic data on these absorbers with information on their morphologies , luminosities , colors , and image structure from direct imaging .",
    "it has proven hard to obtain this information for most dlas .",
    "the imaging of high-@xmath12 dlas has been very difficult and a large fraction of the attempts to detect the ly-@xmath10 emission from high - redshift intervening ( @xmath13 ) dlas have produced either non - detections or weak detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "imaging studies of low-@xmath12 dlas have been more encouraging .",
    "although not always spectroscopically confirmed to be the absorbers , galaxies in images of low - redshift absorber fields often show a variety of morphologies : spirals , irregulars , low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1994 , 1995 ; lebrun et al .",
    "1997 ; bowen et al . 2001",
    "; cohen 2001 ; turnshek et al .",
    "most of these previous searches had limiting flux sensitivity thresholds of @xmath14 and thus could not rule out lsbs , while all of the near - ir searches lacked adequate angular resolution to rule out dwarf galaxies close to the line of sight .",
    "it is not clear which of the several competing scenarios for dlas are valid : large , bright , rotating proto - spirals ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; wolfe & prochaska 1998 ; prochaska & wolfe 1997b , 1998 ) , gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( york et al . 1986 ; matteucci et al .",
    "1997 ) , merging proto - galactic fragments with cold dark matter ( e.g. , haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 ; maller et al .",
    "2001 ) , collapsing halos with merging clouds ( e.g. , mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ) , or low - surface brightness galaxies ( jimenez , bowen , & matteucci 1999 ) .    here",
    "we present the first adaptive optics observations of low - redshift dlas .",
    "we have obtained near infrared images of seven absorbers at @xmath15 with the university of hawaii hokupaa adaptive optics system and near - infrared camera quirc on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "we discuss the observations and data reductions in section 2 .",
    "the analysis of the data are presented in section 3 and the results from individual fields are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we characterize our sample of low - redshift dlas based on our measurements of the sizes , impact parameters , and image structure . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "our sample consists of seven low - redshift absorption systems that have confirmed lyman - alpha absorption features .",
    "the redshift range was constrained so that hour long exposures would reach limiting magnitudes representative of low surface brightness features at the redshift of the absorption systems .",
    "the most stringent observational constraint was set by the ao system s requirement that the target field have a sufficiently bright wavefront reference source for the adaptive optics system ( @xmath19 ) to provide a useful correction . in total six fields with seven absorption systems",
    "were observed .",
    "we present the object field properties in table 1 where we have preserved the nomenclature of dla and sub - dla for reference .    between august 2000 and april 2001 , we observed the fields around the six quasars in the h or k@xmath1 filter ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) with the now - decommissioned university of hawaii 36-element curvature adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( hokupaa ) ( graves et al . 2000 ) on the gemini - north telescope . in all cases",
    "the quasar was used as the wavefront reference source for the ao system .",
    "the university of hawaii near - infrared camera quirc ( hodapp et al .",
    "1996 ) , containing a @xmath20 pixel hgcdte detector , with a pixel scale of @xmath21/pixel , was used as the focal - plane imager .",
    "all data were taken in better than one - arcsecond seeing conditions with two fields observed under photometric conditions .",
    "table 2 summarizes the observations .",
    "each field was observed as a dithered series of short exposures , each exposure being 30 - 180 seconds long .",
    "the sides of the dither pattern were 5   resulting in a final mosaic image with an area approximately @xmath22 in the deepest exposure region .",
    "the dither size of 5   was a compromise between having as large a deep - exposure field as possible and having a separation large enough to generate a sky frame from the on - source data .",
    "after each cycle through a five - point dither pattern , we offset the telescope by roughly @xmath23 and repeated the dither pattern .",
    "this offset was used to ensure that groups of bad pixels could be removed in the data reduction .",
    "this combination of offsets and dithers was carried out until we obtained the total exposure times .",
    "the final mosaic images have quasars with fwhm from 02 to just under 05 .",
    "this should be considered as a rough estimate of the image resolution since in general the quasar is not a point source but may contain a bright host galaxy .",
    "standard data reduction techniques for near infrared imaging were used to produce the final images .",
    "individual frames were sky - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "separate sky frames were constructed for each individual exposure by averaging source - masked dithered frames taken within 10 - 20 minutes of the individual exposure .",
    "flat - fields were constructed from dome flat images with the lamps on and off .",
    "we favor the use of the dome flats over sky flats because sky flats constructed from the object images do not account for the emission from dust on the telescope and instrument surfaces .",
    "this is especially important in the k@xmath1 where the difference between the sky flats and the dome flats were as much as several percent .",
    "bad pixels were identified as hot pixels in short dark frames , as dead pixels in flat frames , and as pixels with large standard deviations in either of the dark or flat sequences .",
    "individual frames were registered to the nearest pixel using the centroid of the quasar and averaged excluding bad pixels and @xmath24 deviations in the stack . the integer pixel registration is more than sufficient for this data since in all cases we have 7 - 20 pixels across the fwhm of the images .",
    "no correction was made for field distortions in the gemini / hokupaa / quirc images as these are small @xcite .      in order to properly study the area near the quasar , we need to remove the contribution to the image of the quasar and its host galaxy .",
    "this problem depends critically on our knowledge of both a point spread function ( psf ) not well described by an analytic function and on the intrinsic nature of the quasar and its host galaxy .",
    "this section describes the qso - subtraction techniques we used .",
    "first , during the observation we observed stars as psf calibrations .",
    "these psf calibration targets were chosen to have a similar right ascension , declination , and visual magnitude as the wavefront reference sources ( e.g. the quasars ) .",
    "observations of the psf calibration fields were made interspersed with those of the quasar fields to sample the changes in the intrinsic atmospheric seeing . in all cases ,",
    "the shape of the calibration psf did not match point sources in the quasar field .",
    "this occurred for several reasons .",
    "first , at the faint magnitudes of these guide stars the correction of the adaptive optics system depends strongly on the photon flux in the wavefront sensor .",
    "while we attempted to select nearby stars with similar catalog magnitudes , matching the wavefront sensor counts was in practice quite difficult and the wavefront sensor photon flux was typically matched to no better than @xmath25 .",
    "second , while we observed the psf calibration fields interleaved with the quasar field , the timescale for seeing changes can be as short as a few minutes .",
    "this is too short for the psf calibration star observations to , in practice , be made under exactly the same atmospheric conditions .",
    "third , the calibration stars were faint in the h / k@xmath1 bands and required long exposure times to reach a snr at large radii to make them useful for psf subtraction .",
    "this was unrealistic given the overheads required .    to circumvent these problems",
    ", we attempted three techniques to generate psfs directly from the data .",
    "first , for quasar fields containing a stellar source we have a psf which was taken under identical atmospheric conditions .",
    "however , for all of the observed fields , the quasar is the brightest source so the signal - to - noise ratio at large radii in these stellar images did not match that of the quasar .",
    "in addition , in the few fields with stellar sources , the sources happen to be only a few arcseconds from the quasar . while this is well within the corrected field of view of the adaptive optics system @xcite , extracting a clean psf to a radius containing most of the stellar flux proved difficult .",
    "knowledge of the psf at these large radii is important because the psfs can have a significant fraction of energy outside their core .",
    "for example , the average @xmath26 encircled energy diameter was @xmath27 in the h band and @xmath28 in the k@xmath1 band .    given that the quasar is the brightest object in the observed fields , we tried constructing a psf from an azimuthally averaged image of the quasar itself .",
    "the azimuthally averaged profile is computed directly from the final image and , by construction , is not subject to differences in the guide star brightness or to variations in the instrinsic seeing .",
    "the resulting psf - subtracted image is similar to an unsharp mask but here the smoothing is done azimuthally .",
    "the technique assumes that the light near the quasar is well represented by the azimuthal average .",
    "asymmetries in the psf can arise from astrophysical sources ( e.g. a host galaxy ) as well as instrumental sources ( e.g. telescope windshake ) .",
    "in many cases the residual in the azimuthally - averaged psf subtracted image contained one pair of symmetric positive flux lobes and another pair of symmetric negative flux lobes .    finally , we constructed models of the psfs using a principle component analysis or karhunen - loeve ( kl ) decomposition .",
    "the karhunen - loeve decomposition has been previously used to quantify psfs by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested using the kl decomposition to quantify the field variations of the psf of adaptive optics systems .",
    "here , we have applied this technique to quantify the modes in which the psf varies with time .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a basis function that characterizes the temporal variations of the image of the quasar .",
    "any component in the final quasar image well fit by this basis function is assumed to be due to the ao psf changing and is removed from the final quasar image .",
    "the karhunen - loeve decomposition provides the means to construct the basis function .",
    "a @xmath29 region centered on the quasar in each of the individual reduced frames was binned @xmath30 pixels , normalized , and centered on the quasar . from this set of images ( @xmath31 )",
    ", we construct the basis function by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the psf covariance matrix :    @xmath32    each eigenvector represents a mode in the basis function and the eigenvalue represents the relative importance of each mode in the basis set .",
    "once the basis function is determined , the quasar in the final image can be reconstructed using the first few modes ( typically @xmath33 ) with the largest eigenvalues of the basis function .",
    "these first few modes are by virtue of the karhunen - loeve expansion the modes with the most variance within the data set . in using this reconstructed model psf",
    ", we can in principle erroneously interpret some underlying parts of the true light from the quasar , host galaxy , or absorber galaxy as a component of the psf since some modes of the basis function could be similar to these light distributions .",
    "since we have constructed the basis set from the covariance matrix , the modes of the basis set describe image structure that changes with time .",
    "faint diffuse objects are less sensitive to changes in the image psf than small unresolved objects .    for each quasar field we generated a kl basis set and then fit the image of the quasar in the final mosaic image with the first 30 modes .",
    "this model quasar was then subtracted from the field to look for objects close to the line of sight of the quasar . in fields with known stellar components we also fit the final stellar image with this same basis set as a measure of the residuals in the psf subtracted images .",
    "figure [ fig : psfsubtraction ] shows a comparison of the techniques we used to remove the contribution of light from the quasar .",
    "each of the four columns in the figure show a different technique applied to the quasar and to the point - source just south of the quasar in the q0850 + 440 field .",
    "the cleanest quasar subtraction is using the kl psf though this analysis is cpu intensive and could only be applied within a couple of arcseconds from the quasar .",
    "residuals in the stellar image subtraction extend to a radius of about 05 .",
    "we take this radius as the minimum separation from the quasar line of sight for an object to be detected with this technique . as simple and",
    "as fast as it is , the azimuthal averaged quasar image worked surprisingly well . while the intensities in these residual images were larger than those in the kl qso - subtracted image by a factor of two , the extent of the residuals were nearly identical .",
    "figures  [ fig:0054 + 145]-[fig:1329 + 412 ] show the reduced image and the qso subtracted image for each field . for fields where hst archival imaging data are available , we show the hst images for comparison .",
    "these archival data are from the hst programs of bahcall ( proposal i d : 5343 , q0054 + 144 ) , burbidge ( 5096 , q0235 + 164 ) , lanzetta ( 5949 , q0850 + 440 ) , bechtold ( 9173 , q1127 - 145 ) , and steidel ( 5984 , q1329 + 412 ) .",
    "we used the automated software sextractor  @xcite to detect sources in our images .",
    "we ran sextractor on the regions with the highest signal - to - noise ratios of the azimuthally - averaged qso - subtracted images .",
    "these regions spanned approximately @xmath34 on each side .",
    "in addition , we ran sextractor on the regions centered at the position of the quasar in the kl quasar - subtracted images .",
    "these smaller regions measured @xmath35 . to look for extremely faint objects , we ran sextractor on the smoothed images . in this latter case",
    ", we used the azimuthally - averaged quasar subtracted images and convolved the images with a gaussian with a fwhm of 20  pixels ( 04 ) .",
    "sextractor requires a number of input parameters to work properly . naturally , the driving parameters are the detection threshold and the number of connected pixels above that threshold . after many test runs , we chose a detection threshold per pixel of @xmath36 of the sky level and a minimum number of contiguous pixels of 75 .",
    "connected pixels are defined as pixels touching any of their sides or corners as implemented in sextractor .",
    "thus for a detection to be triggered , there had to be 75 connected pixels each with an intensity at least @xmath36 above the sky .",
    "our @xmath36 per pixel threshold corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath37  mag / arcsec@xmath38 in h and @xmath39  mag / arcsec@xmath38 in k@xmath1 ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) . in comparison ,",
    "the sky brightness in @xmath40 at mauna kea is @xmath41 mag / arcsec@xmath38 @xcite and @xmath42 mag / arcsec@xmath38 ( gemini hokupa@xmath1a instrument web page ) thus our limiting surface brightness is @xmath43 times fainter than the sky .    at these flux limits ,",
    "we expect to be able to measure image structure for the brighter disk galaxies and to detect dwarf galaxies .",
    "disk galaxies in the coma cluster have typically @xmath44 is the surface brightness at the half - light radius]@xmath45 mag / arcsec@xmath38 @xcite so that at the target absorbers with @xmath46 , we expect disk galaxies to have @xmath44 in the range 20.2 - 21.7 mag / arcsec@xmath38 .",
    "these are just at the surface - brightness limit of our data .",
    "our object detection threshold is much fainter .",
    "for example , virgo cluster dwarf galaxies have a median total h @xmath47 mag  @xcite and would measure @xmath4820 mag at the redshifts of our sample , assuming a flat spectrum .",
    "the limiting magnitude of our observations , defined as the magnitude corresponding to a @xmath49 flux within an aperture of 75 pixels , is approximately @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) . at our flux limits we easily detect typical dwarf galaxies at the redshifts of these absorbers .",
    "the detected sources are presented in table  [ tab : obj ] .",
    "we detect a total of 31 sources around 6 quasars .",
    "the naming convention for objects corresponds to the offset east and north in arcseconds from the quasar centroid .",
    "each of the six quasar fields contains at least one object and five of the six fields show objects previously undetected .",
    "absolute photometry is based on observations of standard stars taken during the same night before and after the observations of the quasar field when observing conditions were photometric . for data obtained under non - photometric conditions",
    ", we used the quasar and its 2mass catalog magnitude to boot - strap the photometry of the objects in the fields .",
    "this is reasonable as long as the quasar is not highly variable in the near - infrared .",
    "there are two cases when the night was not photometric and the quasar is known to be highly variable . for q0235 + 164",
    "we report relative photometry only . in the case of q1127 - 145",
    ", we used the photometry of object g1 from  @xcite kindly provided to us by hsiao - wen chen to boot - strap the photometry for the rest of the objects in the field .",
    "all photometry is reported here as ab magnitudes .",
    "the following relationship between the vega and ab systems @xcite was used : @xmath52 where the zero - point flux is taken to be @xmath53 jy in h and @xmath54 jy in k@xmath1 @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : obj ] , we list for each detected object the i d ( right ascension and declination offsets relative to the quasar ) ; the angular distance to the qso , @xmath55 in arcsec , and the ab magnitude in the h or k@xmath1 band as determined by sextractor .",
    "these are the magnitudes determined using a metric radius defined as 2.5 times the first moment of the light profile @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the intensity profile as a function of radius @xmath58 .",
    "the image properties of the detected sources allow us to charaterize their morphologies and to address the question of whether they are bulge - dominated or disk - dominated .",
    "we determined the structural parameters for roughly half of the detected sources by running gim2d @xcite on the azimuthal - average subtracted images .",
    "out of the 31 sources detected , we were able to extract image structural parameters for nineteen sources .",
    "fourteen sources had high total signal - to - noise ratio and are well separated from the quasar . for five of the sources ,",
    "the structural parameters are largely uncertain ( as seen by the errors in table  [ tab : morph ] ) .",
    "the remaining objects were either too faint or too close to the quasar line of sight to estimate any image structural parameters . in the end , we are able to constrain the morphologies of twelve out of the 31 sources .",
    "gim2d fits two dimensional intensity profiles with a combination of the srsic law and an exponential disk .",
    "each source was fit with three types of models : ( 1 ) single @xmath59-laws , ( 2 ) exponential disks plus @xmath60-laws , and ( 3 ) exponential disks plus @xmath59 laws . in all cases",
    "the psf provided to gim2d was the azimuthally - averaged quasar image .",
    "the output quantities of gim2d include the total luminosity , bulge - to - total ratio ( @xmath61 ) , effective radius ( @xmath62 ) , ellipticity of the bulge , position angle of the bulge , exponential disk scale length ( @xmath63 ) , inclination angle of the disk , position angle of the disk , x and y position offsets , background level , reduced-@xmath64 value , half - light radius , and srsic exponent @xmath65 .",
    "these values are provided with their 99% confidence limit .",
    "if the distributions were normal , they would correspond to a @xmath49 error .",
    "we assign a morphological class based on the values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath65 and their 99% confidence limits . table  [ tab : morph ] presents the derived image structural parameters for each object .",
    "we list the objects i d , the bulge / disk ratio ( @xmath61 ) , the scale lengths ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) in arcseconds , and the exponent @xmath65 of the generalized @xmath59-law . for the bulge - to - total ratio , scale lengths , and exponent",
    ", we also present the 99% confidence limits obtained with gim2d .",
    "an important motivation for the study was to determine whether bulges or disks dominated galaxies account for the low - redshift absorbers .",
    "as such , in assigning a morphological type , we identified the objects as point sources , disk - dominated , bulge - dominated , or a combination of disk and bulge .",
    "of the sources we could measure the structural parameters , 3 of them have fwhm that are identical to the psf .",
    "for these sources , gim2d returned zero scale lengths and we interpret these as point sources .",
    "single @xmath59 fits were used to determine if any of the sources were pure disks . a pure disk would have a value of @xmath66 in the srsic - law only fits .",
    "we found that only two sources are consistent with being pure disks .",
    "we found @xmath67 for q0235 + 164  -5.85 - 2.69 and @xmath68 for q1127 - 145  + 14.5 - 6.76 .",
    "these values are also consistent with the fits done with two components ( see table  [ tab : morph ] ) where they have a small bulge ( @xmath69 ) and large disk scale length ( @xmath70 )",
    ".    the outputs of the @xmath60 and the generalized @xmath59 fits are consistent with each other within the confidence limits . by and",

    "we used the reduced-@xmath72 values that are output by gim2d to discard any bad fits .",
    "there are only two cases in which the reduced-@xmath72 values are large .",
    "from the two component fits , we find that there are 6 disk - dominated galaxies , 3 disk+bulge galaxies , 2 bulge - dominated galaxies , 3 point sources , and 5 unconstrained objects .",
