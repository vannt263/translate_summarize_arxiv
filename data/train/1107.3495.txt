    "within a quantum - thermodynamical approach  @xcite a single subsystem can be shown to relax to a thermal state if appropriately embedded in a quantum environment : the pertinent temperature is determined by the spectral density of this environment , which , for sufficiently large modular embeddings and for a given working point in energy space , shows an approximate exponential behavior . beyond a design of this density",
    "there appears to be no immediate possibility of further manipulation .",
    "putting aside explicitly time - dependent hamiltonians , an interesting way to circumvent this limitation consists in the application of quantum measurements .",
    "measurements play an outstanding role in quantum mechanics , since they provide a connection between the abstract theory and experimentally accessible quantities .",
    "however , in contrast to classical measurements , quantum measurements usually influence the measured system .",
    "a pertinent example for the influence of periodic measurements is the well - known zeno effect  @xcite , i.e. , the suppression of decay by fast repeated measurements .",
    "recently , also the possibility of cooling a tls coupled to an oscillator bath by applying periodic quantum non demolition measurements has been discussed  @xcite .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we discussed the influence of periodic measurements in a quantum - thermodynamical setting and pointed out how different concepts of statistical mechanics may arise from this `` observed quantum thermodynamics '' . here , we present a detailed discussion of the effect of periodic measurements in a generalized environment model , allowing for a detuning between system and environment .",
    "as we will see , this permits us to prepare the embedded system in almost arbitrary thermal states  even the creation of inversion becomes possible .",
    "a typical quantum - thermodynamical model consists of the system of interest and its environment , with which it is allowed to exchange energy via a weak coupling .",
    "the model we investigate here belongs to the class of systems with a modular environment .",
    "following  @xcite we consider a system @xmath0 ( a tls with energy splitting @xmath1 ) described by the pauli operator @xmath2 and coupled via @xmath3 ( strength @xmath4 ) to a quantum environment @xmath5 with hamiltonian @xmath6 , @xmath7    the environment consists of @xmath8 spins ( e.g. , a paramagnetic salt ) with energy splitting @xmath9 each , i.e. , we allow for a detuning @xmath10 between system and environment",
    ". we will show below that this detuning @xmath10 is key for preparing the tls in almost arbitrary thermal states .    without spin - spin interaction the degeneracy of the energy level @xmath11 with",
    "@xmath12 spins up is given by @xmath13 .",
    "around a given @xmath14 , the working point in energy space , the degeneracy structure can be approximated by an exponential of the form @xmath15 for @xmath16 one finds ( see appendix [ sec : thermalizingenvironment ] ) @xmath17 including a weak interaction within the environment , each energy level broadens into an energy band of width @xmath18 .",
    "for the interaction between system and environment we choose @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the creation operator and @xmath21 the annihilation operator for the tls and the environmental part reads @xmath22 to keep the model as unbiased as possible , we do not further specify the interaction but consider the @xmath23 to be a set of random matrices whose entries are taken from a gaussian distribution and are normalized to @xmath24 .",
    "this choice of the normalization together with a sufficiently small @xmath4 guarantees the weak coupling for arbitrary states . due to hermiticity of @xmath3 , we have @xmath25",
    ".    initially we assume a product state for the total system @xmath26 , where the state for the environment @xmath5 is given by @xmath27 i.e. , only band @xmath14 is occupied .    under the above conditions and for @xmath28 the subsystem @xmath5 acts as a thermalizing environment on the tls : subject to undisturbed schrdinger evolution of the total system ( i.e. , without measurements ) , the tls would relax into a state with inverse temperature @xmath29 given by  ( [ eq : beta ] ) independently of its initial state @xmath30  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we want to study the effect of external observation ( by means of periodic measurements ) for this quantum - thermodynamical resonant case as well as for the case of a detuned environment ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "without measurements , the environmental spins have to be in resonance with the tls , i.e. , the detuning has to vanish ( @xmath28 ) in order to allow for a thermalization of the tls .",
    "however , this no longer needs to be the case if we include periodic measurements .",
    "we thus analyze the dynamics of the system with arbitrary detuning @xmath10 disturbed by periodic measurements of the environmental magnetization , i.e. , the system first evolves under pure schrdinger dynamics for some time @xmath32 .",
    "then a measurement of the environmental magnetization ( or rather its energy ) is executed , which means we perform a projection on one of the energy bands @xmath33 .",
    "the pertinent projection operator reads @xmath34 with @xmath35 where we sum over all levels of the measured energy band @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to a state of the tls given by @xmath36 which can be rewritten as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the state of the tls before the measurement and the second term is the so - called co - jump  @xcite caused by the correlations @xmath39 between system and environment straight before the measurement .",
    "since the measurement is incomplete ( measurement of an energy band and not of a single level ) , there may still be some correlations left after the measurement . however , the effect of these correlations is negligible in the case of weak interaction and small band width .",
    "that is , the state of the total system after the measurement can be approximated by a product state . for simplicity",
    ", we introduce a further approximation : since we are not interested in details like the occupation probabilities of the single levels within the energy bands of the environment , we apply some kind of coarse graining by replacing the typically rather complicated state of the environment after the measurement by a simple one of the form  ( [ eq : rho0b ] ) .",
    "this can be done , provided the environment is sufficiently large .",
    "thus , the new state of the total system after the measurement is approximated by @xmath40 i.e. , a form similar to the initial total state but with a new state @xmath41 for the system and possibly a different energy band being occupied for the environment ( if a different energy band has been measured ) .",
    "this procedure can now be repeated periodically . in order to analyze what happens with the tls due to these measurements",
    ", we first have to calculate the state of the tls after a single measurement  ( [ eq : rhocojump ] ) .",
    "this can be done by means of perturbation theory  ( see appendix  [ app : derivation ] ) , which leads to three possible states of the tls corresponding to the three possible measurement results :    in the case of measuring the same energy as in the previous measurement , we obtain the occupation probability of the ground state up to second order in the interaction strength @xmath4 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 in case of measuring one energy band higher than before , we get @xmath44 whereas measuring one energy band lower leads to @xmath45 for the off - diagonal elements we get accordingly @xmath46\\,.\\\\ \\label{eq : rho10p }   { \\rho_{10,+}}(j)&\\approx&\\rho_{01}(j-1)\\frac{1+{\\textup{e}}^{2{\\textup{i}}{\\delta}{{\\delta t}}}-2{\\textup{e}}^{{\\textup{i}}{\\delta}{{\\delta t}}}\\cos(({\\delta}+{\\omega}){{\\delta t}})}{4(2{\\delta}{\\omega}+{\\omega}^2)\\left({\\rho_{11}}(j-1){\\zeta_1}+{\\rho_{00}}(j-1){\\zeta_2}\\right)}\\,,\\\\ \\label{eq : rho10 m }   { \\rho_{10,-}}(j)&\\approx&\\rho_{01}(j-1)\\frac{1+{\\textup{e}}^{2{\\textup{i}}{\\delta}{{\\delta t}}}-2{\\textup{e}}^{{\\textup{i}}{\\delta}{{\\delta t}}}\\cos(({\\delta}+{\\omega}){{\\delta t}})}{4(2{\\delta}{\\omega}+{\\omega}^2)\\left({\\rho_{11}}(j-1){\\zeta_2}+{\\rho_{00}}(j-1){\\zeta_1}\\right)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as one can see , measuring a different band causes significant changes in the occupation probabilities of the tls : for example , if @xmath47 was close to @xmath48 at the previous measurement it will be almost @xmath49 after such a measurement , and vice versa .",
    "thus , one can not expect that a single tls will relax to a stable thermal attractor state as is the case without measurements in the quantum thermodynamical model .",
    "indeed , after sufficiently many measurements the tls will always be in its ground or its excited state , i.e. , passing through some kind of quasi - classical trajectory .    instead , one may ask what happens to the tls in ensemble average .",
    "therefore , we first have to weight each possible outcome with the probability to obtain the corresponding measurement result .",
    "these probabilities are given by  ( [ eq : trpkrhob ] ) : @xmath50 which equals the occupation probabilities of the bands @xmath51 before the measurement .",
    "thus , for a given energy band @xmath52 determined at the preceding measurement @xmath53 , the probabilities for measuring one band higher , one band lower , or the same band , respectively , read @xmath54 this yields the ensemble average ( indicated by an overbar ) for the diagonal elements , @xmath55\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can now iterate this result to get the ensemble - averaged density matrix as a function of the number of measurements , i.e. , the ensemble average after measurement @xmath56 is used as initial state for measurement @xmath57 and so forth .",
    "the calculation for the off - diagonal elements can be found in appendix  [ app : offdiagonalelements ] .",
    "it turns out that the off - diagonal elements vanish for almost any choice of the parameters after sufficiently many measurements ( an interesting exception is discussed below ) , i.e. , the attractor state of the tls will be a thermal state .",
    "we note in passing that the ensemble average coincides with the infinite - time average ( ergodicity ) .",
    "to derive the analytical expression for @xmath58 , we first rewrite  ( [ eq : rho00short ] ) as @xmath59 with @xmath60 the left - hand side can be approximated by a derivative with respect to @xmath56 , as long as @xmath61 changes only slowly with @xmath56 , which is guaranteed by the weak coupling ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , we can approximate  ( [ eq : averagederivation1 ] ) by a differential equation of the form @xmath63 with the solution @xmath64 this means that the ensemble of tlss exponentially approaches an attractor state with increasing number @xmath56 of measurements .",
    "this relaxation has some interesting properties : first , it is noteworthy that due to the measurements a relaxation becomes possible not only in the resonant case ( as without measurements ) but also for @xmath31 .",
    "however , the attractor state reached as well as the relaxation constant depend on the time @xmath32 between the measurements and on the detuning @xmath10 .    considering the relaxation constant @xmath65",
    "one finds @xmath66 which means that the relaxation is slowed down for very rapidly repeated measurements .",
    "such a suppression of decay due to fast , periodic measurements is well known as the so - called quantum zeno effect  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath67 also vanishes for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . for this special choice of the parameters ( characterizing the exceptions we mentioned before )",
    ", the absolute value of the off - diagonal elements also stays constant , as discussed in appendix [ app : offdiagonalelements ] .",
    "thus , it is possible to freeze the initial state of the tls and suppress decoherence by periodic measurements carried out even with finite frequency .    for any other choice of the parameters ,",
    "however , a thermal attractor state is obtained , which also shows remarkable features .",
    "in general , it is given by ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : exponentialrelaxrho00 ] ) ) @xmath72 let us first study the resonant case @xmath28 . because of @xmath73 we get @xmath74 the lowest possible temperature for the tls in this resonant case is obtained for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and is given by @xmath77 .",
    "this is just the temperature the tls would also get according to quantum thermodynamics without measurements ( cf .",
    "however , any other choice of @xmath32 will lead to a higher temperature .",
    "in particular , for rapidly repeated measurements we obtain @xmath78 i.e. , the tls is heated up to very high temperatures ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "finally we want to focus on the effect of a detuning @xmath80 between system and environment : now , the attractor state  ( [ eq : rho00attr ] ) reads @xmath81 and has two new interesting properties compared to the resonant case discussed before .",
    "the lowest possible temperature here is reached for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and is given by @xmath84 this temperature depends on the ratio of the energy splittings of the tls and environmental spins , that is , the off - resonance may be used for cooling the tls down to very low temperatures by choosing proper values for @xmath32 and @xmath10 .",
    "the other remarkable feature is the limit of the lowest possible occupation probability of the ground state , i.e. , the highest temperature . as in the resonant case ,",
    "rapidly repeated measurements lead to @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the off - resonant case , it is even possible to further increase the energy of the tls , i.e. , to create inversion .",
    "the maximum inversion is reached for @xmath85 , @xmath83 , and is given by @xmath86 which corresponds to the negative temperature  @xcite @xmath87 note , that this inversion originates from the influence of the periodic measurements and not from a negative temperature state of the spin environment ( the environmental @xmath88 is positive ) .    by varying the time @xmath32 between the measurements , thermal states of arbitrary temperature within these limits",
    "can be prepared .",
    "possible values of inverse temperatures thus cover the range between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , symmetrically around zero .",
    "( in the resonant case these values are between zero and @xmath88 only . )",
    "[ fig : attractoroffres ] shows the attractor for the occupation probability of the ground state as a function of time @xmath32 and detuning @xmath10 .     as a function of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath10 .",
    "states with low temperature are white and those with high ( negative ) temperature are black .",
    "parameters used : @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig : attractoroffres ] ]",
    "the discussed behavior of the tls under periodic measurements of the environment can be obtained not only for large environments but even for quite small ones consisting of a few spins only . for such small environments the attractor state for the tls depends not only on the initial state of the environment ( working point ) but also on the initial state of the system , since the environmental degeneracy structure can no longer be approximated by an exponential behavior .",
    "this means that the system no longer shows thermodynamic behavior , which requires independence of its initial state .",
    "nevertheless , given the initial state , we can predict the attractor state using our analytical results .    to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider a tls with splitting @xmath1 coupled via a random @xmath93-interaction to a seven - spin environment ( splitting of the spins @xmath94 ) , with initially two spins up .",
    "let us first consider the resonant case @xmath95 with @xmath96 and the tls initially being in its ground state . in this case only the initially occupied environmental `` energy band '' @xmath97 and the band beneath ( @xmath98 ) are involved in the dynamics ( the ground state energy is set to @xmath99 ) .",
    "this means that only the ratio of the degeneracies of these bands determines the final attractor state .",
    "thus , because @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we get an effective inverse temperature @xmath102 and therefore expect @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , this final state is obtained in our numerical exact simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho00measdtpiquasiattr ] .     under periodic measurements of its environment ( seven spins with initially two spins up ) .",
    "we obtain a relaxation to the thermal attractor state with @xmath103 ( dashed line ) .",

    "[ fig : rho00measdtpiquasiattr ] ]    in the off - resonant case , it is possible to obtain inversion as discussed in the last section . to illustrate this , we choose @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "again , initially we start with two spins up .",
    "since now only the second and third bands are involved , we obtain @xmath108 , which yields according to  ( [ eq : rho00attroffreslimit2 ] ) @xmath109 . again",

    "in this paper , we have studied the influence of an effective environment on a coupled two - level system .",
    "we have shown analytically that periodic measurements of the environmental magnetization ( energy ) may lead to a freezing of the initial state , i.e. , suppress decoherence , or may ( in ensemble average ) yield a thermal state for the tls , depending on the choice of the detuning and the time between the measurements .",
    "the temperature of the attractor state reached is controlled by these two parameters , which allows for the preparation of thermal states with almost arbitrary temperature .",
    "it is even possible to create an inversion for the tls .",
    "the key mechanism , which underlies this cooling or creation of inversion , is the periodic destruction of the correlations between the system and its detuned environment .",
    "the resulting periodic reset of the interaction energy allows for a successive change of energy of the system and environment , even if out of resonance .",
    "it is to be expected that the deviation @xmath112 from @xmath113 would give way to non - thermal attractor states in the case of larger subsystems @xmath0 , i.e. , beyond the two - level case .     as demonstrated in our numerical simulations ,",
    "this intriguing behavior can be observed even for quite small environments consisting of a few spins only . in this case , the attractor exhibits dependence on the initial state of the system @xmath0 .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
    "a nuclear magnetic resonance setup has been used for studying the influence of periodic quantum nondemolition measurements in a related model .",
    "we think that similar experiments may also be suitable to experimentally test the results we have derived here .",
    "in this appendix , we show how the degeneracy structure of a system consisting of many spins can be approximated by an exponentially increasing degeneracy around a certain point in energy space , which is a precondition for this system to act as a thermalizing environment  @xcite .",
    "thus , we want to approximate @xmath114 around some working point @xmath14 ( we set the ground state energy to @xmath49 ) .",
    "to do so , we first replace the discrete binomial coefficient by a continuous function , which can be done using @xmath115 , with @xmath116 being the gamma function .",
    "thus , the binomial coefficient can be written as @xmath117 now , we can apply a taylor expansion around @xmath14 , which reads @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the so - called digamma function  @xcite .",
    "comparison of this with the taylor expansion of @xmath120 yields in zeroth order @xmath121 and in first order @xmath122 hence , with  ( [ eq : binomialtaylor1])/([eq : binomialtaylor0 ] ) we get @xmath123 for large @xmath124 the digamma function can be approximated by @xmath125 , which finally leads to equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) , i.e. , @xmath126 this means , that such an environment consisting of many spins with total energy @xmath127 can act as a thermalizing environment on a coupled tls with @xmath128 , enforcing a thermal state of temperature @xmath129 on the tls according to  ( [ eq : betaspinumgebung ] ) .",
