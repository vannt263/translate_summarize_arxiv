    "the standard model ( sm ) can not possibly be a complete theory , since it does not provide an explanation for neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "in addition , it provides no glimmer of insight into the flavour and cp puzzles , or the origin of three distinct gauge forces .",
    "a very ambitious approach , capable in principle of addressing all these questions , is the idea of a grand unified theory ( gut ) combined with a family symmetry which can control the structure of the yukawa couplings , leading to a predictive theory of flavour .",
    "in addition , supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most elegant way to ensure gauge coupling unification , also stabilising the higgs mass ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the state of the art is to combine a realistic gut ( addressing issues like doublet - triplet splitting ) with predictive flavour structures @xcite , and we proposed a fairly complete @xmath12 susy gut of flavour along these lines @xcite .",
    "however the most ambitious , but also the most challenging , of such theories are those based on @xmath1 @xcite where three right - handed neutrinos are predicted and neutrino mass is therefore inevitable .",
    "typically such theories are very difficult to reconcile with a family symmetry , and generally involve rather large dimensional higgs representations .    in this paper",
    "we propose a realistic and fairly complete model , capable of addressing all the above questions unanswered by the sm , based on @xmath13 with a cp symmetry at the high scale .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 is primarily due to its triplet and anti - triplet representation , such that there is no invariant between two triplets , which is convenient due to the sm fermions being placed all in a single @xmath1 @xmath14 , @xmath0 triplet . in addition , the non - trivial singlets of @xmath0 are also useful , as they are used to give rise cp violating phases that are related to the group rather than arbitrary parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "we therefore describe this as spontaneous geometrical cp violation @xcite , in this model in a novel form , as it fixes relative of phases between distinct flavons .",
    "the model has many attractive features , including the use of only the lower dimensional `` named '' representations of @xmath1 , i.e. the singlet , fundamental , spinor or adjoint representations .",
    "@xmath1 is broken via @xmath3 with doublet - triplet splitting achieved by a version of the dimopoulos - wilczek ( dw ) or missing vev mechanism @xcite .",
    "the renormalisable @xmath13 model also involves a discrete @xmath2 .",
    "the family symmetries are broken close to the gut breaking scale to yield the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) supplemented by a right - handed neutrino seesaw mechanism @xcite , where the @xmath15 is the origin of the mssm r - parity @xcite .",
    "the model is realistic in the sense that it provides a successful ( and natural ) description of the quark and lepton ( including neutrino ) mass and mixing spectra , including spontaneous cp violation .",
    "the low - scale yukawa structure is dictated by the coupling of matter to @xmath4 antitriplets @xmath5 whose vevs are aligned in the csd3 directions by a superpotential .",
    "light physical majorana neutrinos masses emerge from a specific implementation of the seesaw mechanism within @xmath1 .",
    "it is fairly complete in the sense that gut and family symmetry breaking are addressed , including doublet - triplet splitting and the origin of the mssm @xmath16 term .",
    "we emphasise the predictive nature of the model .",
    "large lepton mixing is accounted for by the seesaw mechanism @xcite with constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) @xcite .",
    "the basic goal of the flavour sector in these models is to couple the sm fermions to flavons @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , whose vevs are aligned in the csd3 direction @xcite , i.e. where @xmath20 we achieve this in a way that is compatible with an @xmath21 gut , i.e. where all fermion states may be united in a * 16 * of @xmath21 , and left- and right - handed fermions transform equally under the family symmetry . since @xmath21 constrains the dirac couplings of all leptons and quarks to be equal ( within a family ) , it is actually rather non - trivial that the successful scheme in the lepton sector will translate to success in the quark sector . remarkably we find that we can attain good fits to data for quark and lepton masses , mixings and phases .",
    "this is notably different from our previous work @xcite based on @xmath22 with csd3 , wherein the three generations of fermions were not all unified into triplets of the family symmetry .",
    "the full literature on flavoured susy guts @xcite , i.e. which involve a family symmetry , is quite extensive ( for an incomplete list see e.g. @xcite ) , but there have been relatively few attempts in the literature to combine an @xmath21 gut with a discrete non - abelian family symmetry @xcite and we would argue that none are as successful or complete as the present one .",
    "the goal of all these models is clear : to address the questions left unanswered by the sm .",
    "it will take some time and ( experimental ) effort to resolve these models .",
    "however the most promising models are those that make testable predictions while being theoretically complete and consistent .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : yukawa ] we present a renormalisable yukawa superpotential and discuss how it leads to the fermion mass matrices . in section [ sec : alignment ]",
    "we show how the csd3 alignment is produced in @xmath4 , how the flavon vevs are driven , and their relative phases fixed . in section [ sec : gutbreaking ] we show how @xmath21 is broken , and how we achieve doublet - triplet splitting . in section [ sec",

    "although the model is not technically predictive in the quark sector due to an excess of free parameters , the structure of the mass matrices forces some tension between parameters , notably the @xmath540 deviation from the experimental fit value in the strange quark mass .    in the lepton sector",
    "there are two fixed discrete phases plus six continuous input parameters that we fit to three charged lepton masses , two neutrino mass - squared differences and three mixing angles ( a total of eight observables ) , while predicting the cp phase @xmath474 , two majorana phases and the effective neutrino mass @xmath541 .",
    "although our fit does not constitute a full analysis of the parameter space , it agrees with the results of a more dedicated numerical analysis of csd(@xmath413 ) models @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a renormalisable @xmath542 susy gut of flavour .",
    "all symmetries , including an additional @xmath2 discrete symmetry , are broken close to the gut breaking scale due to the action of explicit superpotential terms to yield the mssm with the standard r - parity as the surviving theory at low energies .",
    "the model is very ambitious since it is not only a full @xmath1 susy gut theory , with gut symmetry breaking sectors including doublet - triplet splitting and guaranteeing the absence of extra light doublets , but it also addresses the flavour problem due to additional commuting discrete family symmetries . the mystery of why there are three families of quarks and leptons including their observed pattern of masses and mixing angles is addressed , and a novel form of spontaneous geometrical cp violation arises from the nature of the @xmath0 group .    in many respects @xmath1",
    "is the `` holy grail '' of gut groups since it involves probably the most elegant unification of quarks and leptons , including a right - handed neutrino , making neutrino mass and mixing inevitable ( unlike @xmath3 where neutrino masses could quite happily be set to zero ) .",
    "when combined with the family symmetry @xmath0 , all quarks and leptons are unified into a single multiplet @xmath543 providing a very elegant and simple unification of all matter .",
    "such a complete flavour unification has been attempted before , but until now the technicalities involved have led to only partial success .",
    "the contribution of the present paper lies in showing how many of these technical difficulties may be successfully overcome within a fully fledged @xmath542 susy gut of flavour .",
    "we emphasise that in our model all quark and lepton ( including neutrino ) mass matrices take a particularly simple universal form , with a small correction to the up - type quark mass matrix being responsible for quark mixing .",
    "the heavy right - handed neutrino majorana matrix also has the same universal form , and even including the see - saw mechanism , the low energy effective light left - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix also has this form , indeed corresponding to csd3 , leading to a highly predictive scheme for leptonic mixing .",
    "the model predicts a normal neutrino mass hierarchy with the best - fit lightest neutrino mass @xmath544 or @xmath545 mev , and all neutrino parameters fitted to within @xmath460 of the values predicted by global fits to experiment .",
    "in particular , we predict a cp - violating oscillation phase @xmath546 or @xmath547 , in agreement with current experimental hints .",
    "the model has the following virtues which we summarise as follows :    * it is fully renormalisable at the gut scale , with an explicit @xmath1 breaking sector and a spontaneously broken cp symmetry . *",
    "it involves only the smaller `` named '' representations of @xmath1 . *",
    "the mssm is reproduced below the gut scale , with r - parity emerging from a discrete @xmath30 .",
    "* doublet - triplet splitting is achieved through the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism . *",
    "a @xmath396 term is generated at the correct scale .",
    "* proton decay is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "* @xmath4 justifies the csd3 alignment . * spontaneous geometrical cp violation , where the input phase is the cube root of unity @xmath548 , originates from the @xmath4 .",
    "* we successfully fit all quark and lepton masses , with the pmns mixing matrix predicted ( with no free parameters ) once the physical neutrino masses are specified .",
    "these features are desirable for any flavour or gut model .",
    "achieving them all in the same model represents a significant step towards a complete flavoured @xmath1 gut . at the cost of its large field content ,",
    "the model is rather successful and fairly complete .",
    "nevertheless , some relevant topics remain beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "notably , while we discuss how the model leads to an effective mssm after the symmetries are broken , we do not discuss the details of susy breaking nor the mass spectrum of susy partners at low energy .",
    "furthermore , we have not considered gut threshold corrections and their effect at high energy on gauge coupling unification , nor a possible string theory completion for this model .",
