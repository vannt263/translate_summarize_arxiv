    "historically , searches for new astronomical molecules resulted in the detection of favorable , high line strength transitions based on a thermal approximation to the excitation of these species in interstellar environments . at the temperatures of hot molecular cores inside molecular clouds ,",
    "these transitions often reside at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths .",
    "however , line confusion near the boltzmann peak can lead to ambiguous identifications , and the peak intensities of low abundance , large organic molecules may never rise above the noise floor or the confusion limit .",
    "the success of molecule searches at centimeter wavelengths has shown that unique excitation conditions can lead to the unambiguous identification of very low abundance species with high accuracy .",
    "carbodiimide ( hncnh ) is the second most stable isomer of cyanamide ( nh@xmath0cn ) , with cyanamide being more stable by @xmath14.0 kcal mol@xmath4 @xcite . since the detection of nh@xmath0cn by turner et al .",
    "( 1975 ) toward the high - mass star - forming region sgr b2(n ) , hncnh has been recognized as a candidate interstellar molecule .",
    "hncnh is also a tautomer of nh@xmath0cn , and can be formed via an isomerization reaction whereby a h atom can migrate along the molecular backbone from the amine group . at room temperature ,",
    "hncnh is in thermally - induced equilibrium with nh@xmath0cn at a fraction of @xmath11% .",
    "given typical abundances of nh@xmath0cn and temperatures in many astrophysical environments of @xmath5 k , gas - phase tautomerization of nh@xmath0cn is unlikely to produce hncnh in appreciable abundance . yet",
    ", hncnh may exist in detectable abundance out of thermal equilibrium with nh@xmath0cn as in the case of interstellar hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) and interstellar hydrogen isocyanide ( hnc ) - in which hnc is in greater abundance in some clouds ( see allen , goddard , & schaefer 1980 and references therein ) .",
    "although tautomerization is likely inefficient in the gas phase under interstellar conditions , experimental studies have shown nh@xmath0cn @xmath6 hncnh conversion in water ices and matrices is far more efficient ( duvernay et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) . in the solid phase",
    ", the association of up to five water molecules with nh@xmath0cn on an ice surface has been shown to significantly lower the activation barrier to tautomerization and promote the production of hncnh @xcite .",
    "in fact , hncnh formation on a water - ice surface is shown to occur at temperatures as low as 70 k. the relative abundance of hncnh formed from this process has been measured to range from 4% of nh@xmath0cn at 80 k to as much as 13% at 140 k @xcite . in the laboratory , hncnh sublimation occurs between 80 - 170 k , with no additional desorption observed above 170 k @xcite . in the ism ,",
    "non - thermal desorption via shocks is also a likely liberation mechanism . assuming that tautomerization of nh@xmath0cn on dust grain ice mantles is the dominant formation pathway for hncnh , and that subsequent desorption occurs for both species , the gas phase abundance of hncnh may be capped at @xmath1@xmath7 of nh@xmath0cn .",
    "nh@xmath0cn has an estimated column density of @xmath12@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath3 towards sgr b2(n ) @xcite ; we therefore anticipate an hncnh column density on the order of ( @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 ) . if thermal emission at hot core temperatures dominates the spectrum of hncnh , the most favorable high line strength transitions are at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , we have previously used the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) to detect new molecular species including trans - methyl formate @xcite , and cyanoformaldehyde @xcite which _ only _ had measurable astronomical line intensities detected at centimeter wavelengths . encouraged by these results , we searched for centimeter wave transitions of hncnh .",

    "the primos project recorded a nearly frequency continuous astronomical spectrum from 1 to 50 ghz towards the sgr b2(n ) molecular cloud , with the pointing position centered on the large molecule heimat ( lmh ) at ( j2000 ) @xmath12 = 17h47m19.8s , @xmath13 = -28@xmath142217  . an lsr source velocity of + 64 km s@xmath4 was assumed .",
    "intensities are presented on the t@xmath15 scale @xcite .",

    "( 2012 ) for further details of the observations , full data reduction procedure , and analysis .",
    "targeted transitions of hncnh are shown in table [ transitions ] which lists each transition s rotation - torsion doublet transition quantum numbers , calculated rest frequency ( mhz ) , logarithm of the einstein a coefficient , lower state energy ( cm@xmath4 ) , and gaussian fitted astronomically measured line intensity ( mk ) and fwhm line widths ( km s@xmath4 ) in the observed spectra .",
    "the table provides gaussian fit parameters for peak intensity and line width for components at v@xmath17 = + 64 km s@xmath4 and + 82 km s@xmath4 .",

    "the initial identification of hncnh was based on only the two lines at 4.3 and 4.8 ghz . in order to quantify the probability of coincidental overlap of features at these frequencies which could lead to a possible mis - assignment",

    "that probability drops to 0.002% .",
    "we find this is both compelling evidence for a clear detection and an excellent example of the power of the gbt in new molecule detections at centimeter wavelengths , where line confusion is drastically reduced relative to the millimeter and sub - millimeter regimes .",
    "initially , the large beamwidths and high - energy nature of the observed lines pointed to emission arising from the hot , extended source that surrounds the cold lmh and couples well to the beam at these frequencies .",
    "an lte analysis , however , showed excessively high column densities for thermal emission arising from these lines . in order to further verify the identification , and to understand the unusually high intensities of the lines ,",
    "we examined higher frequency transitions . unfortunately , the gbt has no receiver that operates between 15 - 16 ghz ; we detected an emission feature at 25.0 ghz , but its doublet transition at 25.5 ghz is blended with the 9(2,7)-9(1,8 ) transition of ch@xmath18oh at 25.541 ghz ; we detected no emission features at 36.6 and 37.1 ghz ; and a feature was identified at 45.8 ghz , the highest frequency line currently covered in the primos survey .",
    "the lack of observed transitions at 36.6 and 37.1 ghz was initially troubling as there has been a firmly established series of requirements for an interstellar detection , including that no transition which should be of an observable intensity be  missing \" ( snyder et al .",
    "however , an examination of the rotational energy level structure of hncnh offers an explanation .",
    "figure [ energylevels ] shows energy level diagrams containing transitions that are relevant to the observed masing lines at 4.8 ghz ( labeled  m \" , figure 2(a ) ) and 36.7 ghz ( labeled  x \" , figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical parameters associated with transitions in figure 2 are given in table [ energylabels ] .",
    "in the case of the 4.8 ghz line  m \" , the upper energy level ( @xmath22 18(0,18 ) ) is coupled to higher energy levels via fast millimeter and sub - millimeter transitions ; the only downward transition out of this level is very slow , with an einstein a coefficient of @xmath26 s@xmath4 .",
    "downward and upward transitions out of the lower level ( @xmath23 17(1,17 ) ) , labeled  a - d \" , however , occur rapidly with einstein a values between 0.2 - 2 x 10@xmath27 s@xmath4 .",
    "this creates a population inversion between the @xmath22 18(0,18 ) and @xmath23 17(1,17 ) levels , leading to the observed masing at 4.8 ghz .",
    "an analogous process occurs for the torsion doublet , causing masing at 4.3 ghz .",

    "population inversion is not achieved because of the presence of this drain , and the 36.7 ghz transition does not mase .",
    "a similar scenario holds for the 15.9 ghz transitions , as well as their torsion doublets . in summary ,",
    "an analysis of the energy levels of hncnh predicts a population inversion resulting in masing for the torsion doublets at 4 , 25 , and 46 ghz , with no masing by the doublets at 15 and 36 ghz .",
    "furthermore , the 4 ghz doublets should show a greater degree of inversion due to the longer lifetime of the transitions ( table [ transitions ] ) than the 25 or 46 ghz transitions , resulting in more intense lines , which is in excellent agreement with our observations .",
    "the observed maser emission is relatively weak and displays no line narrowing , suggesting that these are unsaturated maser lines . as collisional and radiative pumping",
    "rates for hncnh are unknown , a full pumping model was not possible and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "a zeroth - order calculation of the critical density for the fast transitions connecting the maser transitions was , however , performed . using collisional coefficients for similar transitions in hnco",
    ", we find critical densities required to thermalize these transitions on the order of 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 @xmath30 , far higher than those typically associated with the region . given this , and that the sgr b2(n ) region is known to contain a broad range of favorable radiative excitation conditions , a radiative excitation mechanism for these transitions is possible .",
    "the current observations , however , do not provide a definitive answer to the excitation question , and further investigation is warranted",
    ". a mapping study of the 4 ghz lines in sgr b2(n ) would be extremely beneficial to elucidating the environment these signals are arising from , including their spatial correlation with other known maser such as ch@xmath18oh , and therefore the most likely excitation mechanisms .",
    "we have also carried out an analysis of the expected intensity of hncnh lines in this frequency region based on a thermal population of hncnh .",
    "assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , we calculate a column density of hncnh giving rise to the 4 ghz maser lines of @xmath12 x 10@xmath31 @xmath3 at 150 k , although this value is largely invariant over temperatures from 80 - 500 k. given this column density , the expected intensity of the 36.7 ghz transition would be @xmath1740 mk . further , at a column density of @xmath12 x 10@xmath2 @xmath3 ( @xmath110% of nh@xmath0cn in this source @xcite ) , we would expect the most intense lines in this region to be less than 1 mk for rotational temperatures above 80 k. given this , and the lack of any detection at 36.7 ghz with an rms noise level of @xmath110 mk , we conclude these transitions are not arising from a thermal population .",
    "this is consistent with our non - detection of transitions which are not masing . in gas above 80 k , the most intense lines of hncnh at lte would fall at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "numerous high - resolution , high - sensitivity spectral line surveys of this region have been carried out ( see wang et al . 2011 , tercero et al .",
    "2010 & nummelin et al . 2000 and",
    "refs . therein ) covering the these transitions up to @xmath11.8 thz . with an abundance of 10% nh@xmath0cn , the strongest transitions under lte emission at 80 k would be on the order of the rms noise level of the survey observations . with increasing temperature",
    ", the expected line strengths decrease rapidly .",
    "thus , at these column densities , a thermal population of hncnh would likely not be detectable in even the most sensitive line surveys to date .",
    "this is in itself remarkable .",
    "a heroic effort has been performed in recent years on compiling molecular inventories and facilitating new molecule detections using state - of - the - art millimeter and sub - millimeter observatories and molecular line surveys .",
    "these surveys have provided invaluable information on the physical and chemical conditions present in the ism and their high scientific value is unquestionable .",
    "they suffer , however , from extremely high line densities and long integration times , relative to lower - frequency telescopes . because of this",
    ", identifications of new molecular species , especially those in low abundance , can be difficult due to the line confusion at the noise floor and the degree of coincidental overlap of target lines with other molecular transitions .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that a molecule which would be undetectable via transitions arising from a thermal population can be identified via maser transitions at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "this detection was possible only through low frequency surveys of a chemically rich region by the gbt through a dedicated project ( primos ) .",
    "the number of transitions which display significant maser activity in any given molecule is likely to be small , but weak masing behavior has been observed in a number of molecules such as h@xmath0co and nh@xmath18 @xcite . in addition , at centimeter wavelengths the lack of line confusion makes definitive identification of a species possible with only a small number of observed transitions .",
    "this may represent a new strategy for searches for key molecules of interest to the astrochemistry and astrobiology communities which have not yet been detected due to their low abundances .",
    "in summary , we have detected four transitions of carbodiimide ( hncnh ) towards sgr b2(n ) with very high confidence .",
    "all four signals have been found to be the result of maser activity .",
    "we also report two transitions that were not detected , consistent with hncnh only being detectable towards sgr b2(n ) through maser lines .",
    "this detection presents a new methodology for searches for interstellar molecular candidates which may be too low in abundance to be detected in thermal emission by modern radio observatories .",
