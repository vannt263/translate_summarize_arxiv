    "quantum gravity can in general be expected to provide a foundation which is radically different from classical smooth background geometries in that space and time should be discrete .",
    "evolution equations are then no longer given by differential equations in space and time , but by difference equations which in general can be approximated by differential equations only on large scales .",
    "this is realized explicitly in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , based on loop quantum gravity @xcite , where one obtains difference equations for the evolution of a universe @xcite .",
    "this has physical implications , in particular concerning the singularity issue , but also conceptual ones since solutions of difference equations can generically behave differently from those of differential equations .",
    "in this paper we focus on properties of solutions of isotropic loop quantum cosmology in the large volume region , where one expects differential equations to provide a good approximation @xcite .",
    "there are several cases where the boundedness of solutions is of interest , for instance when a probability interpretation is used @xcite or the physical inner product is studied @xcite . from the continuum limit",
    "one can draw generic expectations , as in quantum mechanics , since one only needs to know whether regions of interest are classically forbidden .",
    "in such a case , one expects exponential behavior of solutions of a differential equation and bounded solutions only in exceptional cases .",
    "however , since these issues can depend sensitively on precise values of a solution , a direct analysis of the difference equation without detour through the continuum limit is preferable .",
    "this analysis is performed here with a general confirmation of the expectations . as a spin - off of the investigation",
    "we obtain a semi - analytical procedure which allows to determine initial values for bounded solutions .",
    "the resulting formula is much stronger than a numerical trial and error procedure , and does not only apply to those few models where exact solutions are known .",
    "dynamical properties of a universe in isotropic loop quantum cosmology @xcite are determined by a wave function @xmath0 subject to a difference equation of the type @xmath1 in terms of volume eigenvalues @xmath2",
    "@xcite which also show the geometrical meaning of the label @xmath3 . a precise model is specified by the choice of a matter field @xmath4 and hamiltonian @xmath5 and by fixing @xmath6 to be zero for a flat model or one for a model of positive spatial curvature .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity @xcite , which fixes the scale of spatial discreteness .",
    "there are other versions of the equation , for instance obtained after a symmetrization procedure which changes the coefficients but not their large @xmath8 behavior .",
    "our analysis will also apply to this equation .",
    "however , sometimes equations of higher order appear for which a similar analysis will be more complicated , as commented on later in this paper .",
    "similarly , partial difference equations obtained for anisotropic models @xcite require more care .    at small @xmath8",
    "the difference equation can be used to understand quantum aspects of the classical singularity at @xmath9 @xcite , while at large @xmath10 one expects semiclassical behavior @xcite . here , we are interested in asymptotic properties of solutions at large @xmath10 , in particular their boundedness or oscillatory properties . for simplicity , we base the analysis on phenomenological matter systems which do not require an additional matter field . in those cases ,",
    "the equation takes the asymptotic form @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "matter hamiltonians of interest are the cosmological constant term @xmath14 , dust with @xmath15 constant , radiation @xmath16 , or a free massless scalar with plane wave initial conditions where @xmath17 . in all these cases ,",
    "the right hand side of ( [ asdiff ] ) is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is constant in a given model , but can in general take both signs .",
    "we simply denote constants characterizing the matter content by @xmath20 , even if they do not correspond to a cosmological constant .",
    "furthermore , without loss of generality we drop the constant @xmath6 and define @xmath21 to be zero in flat models ( after having absorbed it in @xmath20 on the right hand side ) .",
    "this brings us to the general equation @xmath22 to be studied .    since the step size of the difference equation is four , defined for a wave function on the real line , values of @xmath0 between any @xmath8 and @xmath23 are unrelated by the equation .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , there can thus be oscillations on arbitrarily small scales , which for intuitive reasons one would like to be suppressed in semiclassical regimes .",
    "if this is the case , a solution is called pre - classical @xcite .",
    "this is partially a matter of initial conditions , but even within a given sequence at an integer lattice @xmath24 can small scale oscillations develop . whether or not this can be suppressed depends now on the difference equation and thus has to be decided by an asymptotic analysis .",
    "oscillations on larger scales are allowed and show the presence of a classically allowed regime .",
    "also the occurrence of these oscillations can be seen by a general analysis .    in regimes",
    "where there are no large scale oscillations , which then are classically forbidden , one expects exponential behavior of solutions .",
    "generically , the exponentially growing contribution will dominate such that the issue of boundedness of solutions arises in particular in models showing a classical recollapse @xcite .",
    "both issues , pre - classicality and boundedness , have been used for an understanding of the semiclassical limit @xcite and the physical inner product @xcite , even though the precise status of the conditions is not clear .",
    "nevertheless , in those investigations one often needs to find special solutions , such as bounded ones , which are difficult to detect numerically in a reliable manner .",
    "it is thus necessary to have analytical tools available . for oscillations , generating function techniques",
    "have been used @xcite , but this is applicable only in special cases ( such as integer @xmath19 in our equation , and with ignoring the absolute value signs ) .",
    "the methods used here are more general and also apply to the boundedness issue .",
    "it may happen that additional conditions will force @xmath8 to take discrete values @xcite ( enumerated by but not necessarily identical to integer numbers ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to construct tools in such a way that this possible discretization will be built in .",
    "to do so , we first notice that any real number can be represented as @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and define @xmath28 .",
    "next , we find that the set of integer numbers splits into four disjoint subsets : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "( we could have reduced solutions to only one subset by allowing @xmath31 .",
    "however , higher order equations , such as order four here , naturally arise in loop quantum cosmology , and so we leave this explicit for the sake of generality . )    when discretization is implied , the delta parameter is being fixed and the subset concept is very useful . if not , every subset gives rise to a channel @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "these four channels cover @xmath34 completely .",
    "equation ( [ realmu ] ) can then be rewritten : @xmath35 for simplicity , we will drop the label @xmath36 in @xmath37 and simply write @xmath38 .",
    "different sequences will be distinguished from each other by the appearance of @xmath36 inside the absolute value in @xmath39",
    "we start with the case of a cosmological constant , i.e.  @xmath40 , in order to illustrate the main techniques .",
    "so equation ( [ main ] ) takes the form : @xmath41      we define @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 the subset index ( @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 an arbitrary integer . introducing this into ( [ start ] ) results in @xmath48 which is more convenient to investigate , starting with the @xmath49 region .    to establish the asymptotic behavior we define @xmath50 we have @xmath51 which allows expressing @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 .    for @xmath54",
    ", we can still keep @xmath55 and @xmath36 positive ( @xmath56 ) but substitute @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( [ start ] ) .",
    "it is then more convenient to use @xmath59 instead , in order to investigate the regime of large negative @xmath55 .",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath60 and the recurrence now is @xmath61      with ( [ hrec ] ) and the analogous equation for @xmath53 , latexmath:[$h(n)=\\lambda    latexmath:[\\[h(n+4)=\\lambda |n+\\delta|-2-\\frac{1}{\\lambda    iterated , for which it is convenient to use a suitable notation to indicate that the @xmath6-th step of iteration has been performed : @xmath63 as we observe , in the @xmath6-th step we have @xmath6 denominators with expressions as @xmath64 and an ending term @xmath65 .",
    "this process of iteration allows investigating the behavior of @xmath52 in terms of arbitrary initial conditions of the form @xmath66 , @xmath67 .    for @xmath54 we perform the first step of iteration by @xmath68 and have in the @xmath6-th step @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the iteration process leads easily to asymptotic relations ( large @xmath71 behavior ) . in this section",
    "we will elucidate why this is the case , discussing only @xmath72 such that @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "then the ending term for the @xmath6-th iteration is @xmath75 .",
    "also for simplicity we set @xmath76 , and thus the two last denominators of @xmath77 are @xmath78 to convince ourselves that choosing @xmath79 arbitrarily does not greatly affect the large @xmath55 behavior of @xmath52 , we can simply reverse the whole procedure .",
    "we pick any value of @xmath79 and , after a few steps , the system looses any information about it . to see this we present some examples . because we always have inverse powers of @xmath53 , such as in @xmath80 and @xmath81 initial values for @xmath79 such that @xmath82 ( but not equal ) could give rise to singular behavior .",
    "indeed , @xmath83 is large , but then @xmath84 so all information about the potentially dangerous value of @xmath79 has been lost and the iteration proceeds as in the generic case .    for completeness ,",
    "let us see now what happens when @xmath85 is equal to zero .",
    "to proceed we introduce a parameter @xmath86 and a new initial value @xmath87 such that @xmath88 as @xmath86 tends to zero , we will find @xmath83 explode to infinity , and @xmath89 tend to @xmath90 .",
    "so this is just the limiting case of the previous one .",
    "there exists , however , one very special choice of @xmath79 whose value is influential on the whole sequence @xmath53 .",
    "if we pick @xmath79 such that the following sequence of an infinite number of constraints holds , @xmath91 then cancellations occur within the continued fraction step after step such that the previously observed `` forgetfulness '' can not be realized .",
    "first of all , we can see that if the above sequence of constraints holds , it will hold only for one , unique initial value which we call @xmath92 ( unique for given @xmath20 , @xmath36 and @xmath6 ) . in app .",
    "[ a : hbound ] we present more discussion on this choice and prove that it leads to a vanishing solution for large @xmath55 . the discussion above and in app .  [ a : hbound ] signals that bounded solutions are permitted by our asymptotic relations .",
    "furthermore , we will present tools , which allow us to find bounded solutions in a simple and explicit manner .    for values of @xmath79 slightly different from @xmath93 ,",
    "the iteration undergoes locally abrupt behavior , but after a few steps it smoothes again .",
    "so even for @xmath79 very close to @xmath92 the information about the initial value is being lost .",
    "if @xmath79 is different from @xmath93 it is useful to split the fraction ( [ hp ] ) into two pieces ( recall that @xmath94 ) .",
    "the lower part of the fraction , which is affected by initial value choices for which possibly the @xmath95 term does not dominate , will be called `` part b '' .",
    "the upper part , unaffected by the initial value choice and for which @xmath64 is much bigger than one , will be called `` part a '' .",
    "thus , there is a @xmath96 such that part b is identical to @xmath97 , and part a is @xmath98 with part b used as initial condition .    from our arguments",
    ", we conclude that part b will become a small initial value contributing to part a. so what is left is part a , which is convergent but gives a negligible contribution , compared to the leading @xmath99 , as we move to the large @xmath55 regime .",
    "the same reasoning applies for any choice of an initial value @xmath100 .",
    "it is also easy to convince oneself that the above arguments are independent of our previous choice @xmath73 .",
    "if the initial value is different from @xmath101 , there are at most finitely many near cancellations , and the following asymptotic relations ( for large @xmath55 ) hold @xmath102 @xmath103 since the fraction part of ( [ hp ] ) or ( [ hn ] ) can be ignored .",
    "the previous results allow us to draw conclusions for the pre - classicality of solutions , in particular alternating behavior .",
    "the subset splitting presented in sec .",
    "[ lqc ] allows us to reduce @xmath104 to four equations @xmath105 each valid on one set @xmath46 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "each of them is of second order , and thus needs two initial values .",
    "there are no mixing terms , i.e.  terms that mix @xmath38 from different @xmath46 subsets .",
    "so these four equations are fully independent .",
    "because for large @xmath55 ( and for ratios different from @xmath101 ) @xmath107 and analogously for @xmath108 , we see that the asymptotic behavior excludes solutions where @xmath38 and @xmath109 ( also @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) are of the same sign .",
    "this means that pre - classicality within one subset @xmath46 is not preserved .",
    "additionally , it may happen that the solution between different subsets is not pre - classical . because , as we have seen , the original equation reduces to four independent equations of second order , for each equation we need two initial values .",
    "it may then happen , for example , that for @xmath112 @xmath38 oscillates with different phase than for @xmath113 .",
    "since we have just proved that generic solutions of ( [ start ] ) are not pre - classical within a subset , non - preclassicality between different subsets is only of secondary interest .",
    "however , we will meet equations which are pre - classical within a subset , and therefore it would be of interest to remove non - preclassical behavior between different subsets on the whole set @xmath114 .",
    "a simple example of such an equation is ( [ startbar ] ) . the same reasoning as above implies now that @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( also @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) are of the same sign , so the solutions are pre - classical within a subset .",
    "we will show how to remove non - preclassical behavior among different subsets by a proper choice of initial values . in the next part we will present generalization to other models .",
    "again , we start with the positive @xmath55 direction of iteration which will simply generalize to the negative one . we rewrite ( [ startbar ] ) in a form @xmath119 where @xmath120    shifting the label by four and substituting @xmath121 in the right hand side of ( [ rewrite ] ) , we get @xmath115 in terms of @xmath122 and @xmath123 . after @xmath6 iteration steps",
    "we reach @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are functions of @xmath55 whose structure is of course @xmath6-dependent . for step",
    "@xmath127 we have @xmath128 and from ( [ rewrite ] ) @xmath129 substituting this in ( [ ansatz ] ) we obtain @xmath130 comparing with previous expressions for @xmath131 we obtain the recurrence relations @xmath132 having already used relation ( [ rec2 ] ) in ( [ rec1 ] ) . to close these recurrence relations",
    ", we notice that @xmath133    we will now focus on relation ( [ rec1 ] ) , which has a symmetric form similar to ( [ start ] ) .",
    "this suggests to introduce @xmath134 and rewrite equation ( [ rec1 ] ) as @xmath135 if we choose to use as initial values @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xmath44 is the subset constant for @xmath46 , defined by @xmath45 , and @xmath138 indicates the initial values in a given subset ) , we may write @xmath139 where @xmath140 has been substituted by @xmath141 . to assure that ,",
    "for example , the solution is positive for large values of @xmath55 , the condition @xmath142 easily implies @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 is the sign of the @xmath125 coefficient which is discussed in app .",

    "it is sufficient to use equation ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "arguments on convergence of ( [ rho ] ) are given in app .",

    "so by a proper initial value choice we can make all four solutions on @xmath147 positive or negative . if @xmath8 is not discrete , one proceeds as before and makes all solutions positive or negative for all @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ rho ] ) is easy to handle , but nevertheless it is instructive to discover some properties of this equation for a few particular cases ( for simplicity putting @xmath148 ) .    [ [ section ] ] 1 .",
    "+ +    subset @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 as initial values :    then @xmath152 and shifting variables in ( [ rho ] ) to @xmath153 we obtain @xmath154 as expected , this expression is for large @xmath55 almost independent of @xmath55 .",
    "the only parameter left is @xmath20 , of which two values are particularly interesting :    \\a ) @xmath155 : because @xmath156 we get @xmath157 in agreement with the results in app .  [ a : atwo ] .",
    "\\b ) @xmath158 : on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rhocont ] ) the fraction can then be neglected , and we have @xmath159 this subset and these initial values are , however , very special because for @xmath160 the @xmath20-term in @xmath161 in ( [ rhocont ] ) does not contribute .",

    "this follows from the subset splitting where for subset @xmath149 we have @xmath168 if we put @xmath169 in the above equation we see that the recurrence starts with @xmath170 which is @xmath20-independent . for @xmath162 , however , we have @xmath171 and putting @xmath169 leads to @xmath172 .",
    "so @xmath20 appears at the zeroth iteration step .",
    "now it is essential that due to ( [ rholambda ] ) the regime for constant sign is sensitive to values of @xmath20 in contrast to the subset @xmath149 .",
    "it is clear that this is the generic behavior , @xmath149 being the only exception .",
    "+ for negative @xmath55 we proceed similarly , starting with @xmath173 such that @xmath174 allows us to write @xmath175 with @xmath176 .      in this subsection",
    "we assume positive @xmath55 ; the generalization to negative @xmath55 is immediate .",
    "using @xmath177 we write @xmath178 and , using the @xmath55-independence of @xmath177 for large @xmath55 , clearly see the different roles played by the two initial values .",
    "the leading order contribution to @xmath177 for an arbitrary subset and arbitrary value of @xmath138 is @xmath179 and thus it can happen that @xmath180 is a small number , depending on where initial conditions are stated ( @xmath138 ) in relation to @xmath181 . from eq .",

    "higher order difference equations can also occur @xcite , for which we can still introduce @xmath53 as before .",
    "however , if there are also terms with @xmath259 , the equation for @xmath53 obtained after dividing by @xmath38 contains @xmath260 which makes it more complicated to solve .",
    "there are two different origins of unboundedness of solutions of difference equations .",
    "the first appears in classically forbidden regions , and is not different from unboundedness in the continuum limit .",
    "this happens if @xmath261 , which can come from positive curvature @xmath7 or negative matter terms such as a negative cosmological constant .",
    "there is also a second possibility , where now the behavior of solutions to a difference equation is completely different from that of a differential equation .",
    "this happens if @xmath262 , which we have for a positive cosmological constant . in this case , the solution is not only unbounded but also has alternating behavior and is thus not pre - classical .",
    "such a behavior can not occur in the continuum limit , and expresses the presence of large curvature .",
    "it should be interpreted as a breakdown of the minisuperspace approximation where the integrated curvature is the only curvature quantity .",
    "local curvature is small if the cosmological constant is small , but the integrated curvature @xmath263 becomes large just from large volume .",
    "as the analysis here shows , this behavior is clearly distinguished and easily detectable .",
    "let us assume that the sequence of constraints ( [ seq ] ) holds .",
    "this means that if we take a large positive value of @xmath55 , then there exists a small @xmath264 such that @xmath265 if we assume @xmath266 then @xmath267 and @xmath268 implying in turn @xmath269 a cancellation is then blocked by the @xmath270 term , which is in contradiction to the assumption of cancellations for all @xmath55 .",
    "so we have @xmath271 and the sequence is decreasing .",
    "one can easily find out that @xmath53 with the choice @xmath101 is much smaller than one but positive . together with the previous",
    "prove this implies that solutions are vanishing asymptotically .",
    "one can convince oneself , that this is the case by noting that the previous observations imply for large @xmath55 ( and positive solutions ) @xmath272 for some @xmath47 and @xmath273 , and thus @xmath274 .",
    "for negative solutions we have @xmath275 and again conclude @xmath276 .",
    "the generalization to large negative @xmath55 is straightforward .",
    "by definition , the coefficients @xmath125 obey the recurrence relation @xmath277 with @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "we will prove that for @xmath280 for all @xmath55 all @xmath125 coefficients are positive .",
    "we have @xmath281 noting that @xmath282 because @xmath283 as assumed .",
    "let us assume now that @xmath284 for @xmath285 .",
    "then @xmath286 and by induction we finish the prove that @xmath287 for all @xmath6 .",
    "so the sequence @xmath288 is growing strictly monotonically and its initial values are positive , implying @xmath289 .",
    "we now turn to the case where @xmath290 \\qquad \\mbox { and } \\qquad a(n)\\geq 2 \\qquad \\mbox { for } { \\mathbb z}\\setminus [ n_1,n_2]\\ ] ] and consider the positive @xmath55 direction of iteration first . if we take large @xmath55 ( fulfilling @xmath291 ) , then @xmath292 for @xmath293 where we have @xmath294 for @xmath293 , and so @xmath295 for @xmath293 .",
    "we must then investigate what happens with the sign of @xmath125 for @xmath296 ( one should note that @xmath297 does not depend on @xmath55 ) . with help of the already established formula @xmath298 and @xmath299 we find @xmath300 .",
    "we then use this formula again to see whether or not @xmath301 changes its sign . if not",
    ", @xmath302 is also positive .",
    "we then investigate @xmath303 , and so on .",
    "every time @xmath304 we have a change of sign , until we reach the desired value @xmath305 .",
    "so one such iteration procedure allows to find both @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "we will prove in the next subsection that for @xmath211 as in ( [ a ] ) @xmath307 exists , and that @xmath308 is @xmath55-independent for large @xmath55 , and so must equal @xmath309 .",
    "so it is sufficient to apply the above procedure for one value of large @xmath55 .      the problem of existence of @xmath310 is closely related to the existence of continued fractions .",
    "we will show this for the positive @xmath55 direction of iteration . from eq .",
    "( [ rhoagain ] ) we have @xmath311 substituting @xmath312 we reach @xmath313 so if @xmath211 is of the form ( [ a ] ) , there exists @xmath314 such that for all @xmath315 we have @xmath316 .",
    "with help of results of [ a : cont ] , we conclude that ( [ rhofrac ] ) is convergent , and for large @xmath55 almost @xmath55-independent .",
    "if @xmath318 , we are dealing with a difference equation whose coefficients are almost constant at large @xmath55 ( or exactly constant for @xmath317 ) and which is of the form @xmath319 with a real parameter @xmath320 .",
    "this equation can be analyzed by explicit solutions , but care must be taken in interpreting the results since the limiting value @xmath321 for large @xmath55 and @xmath202 is a critical value of the difference equation .",
    "we start with subset @xmath149 and introduce the generating function @xmath322 . from equation ( [ diffconst ] ) we get @xmath323 and @xmath324 to find solutions we must expand this generating function as a power series in @xmath325 .",
    "one easily sees that the numerator will only result in a variable shift , and the main task is to expand @xmath326 we will use @xmath327 with roots @xmath328 which are real if and only if @xmath329 .",
    "for this case , we write @xmath330 and @xmath331 . from ( [ g ] )",
    "we reach @xmath332 for the large @xmath47 behavior we notice that for @xmath333 we have @xmath334 and @xmath335 . for large @xmath55",
    "the second term in bracket in ( [ t ] ) becomes negligible and the first one results in @xmath336 .",
    "we make an analytic continuation to the principal sheet in ( [ t ] ) and prove that the @xmath338 remain real .",
    "we see that @xmath339 and write @xmath340 , @xmath341 . before going",
    "further we notice @xmath342 so that the roots are pure phase .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ t ] ) as @xmath343 thus , for @xmath344 solutions are oscillating with constant amplitude and @xmath345 is a critical point .    from @xmath346",
    "we find the oscillation period @xmath347 .",
    "since @xmath348 the closer @xmath320 is to two , the longer the period is , and solutions slowly acquire the non - oscillating nature of @xmath349 ( in [ a : atwo ] we show that also the case @xmath345 is non - oscillating ) .    making the already mentioned variable shift in @xmath350 we reach @xmath351 in terms of @xmath55 and for an arbitrary subset we have @xmath352 we also conclude that if @xmath211 is such a function that for all @xmath86 there is an @xmath138 for which @xmath353 for all @xmath354 such that for large @xmath55 we have @xmath355 and ( [ sols ] ) with @xmath356 is an approximate solution to @xmath357 .    it should be noted that the bigger the value of @xmath55 is , the better condition ( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "however , it does not imply that @xmath358 , obtained after substituting @xmath320 by @xmath211 , is constant .",
    "rather , it varies very slowly compared to the change of @xmath38 when @xmath55 is changed by four .",
    "one also must remember that @xmath345 is a critical point of the asymptotic equation , so substituting @xmath320 by two instead of observing condition ( [ cond ] ) will not lead to correct results .",
    "we will employ another tool used to investigate loop quantum cosmology equations .",
    "this is a continued fraction , which we define by : @xmath359 noticing @xmath360 we have @xmath361 this is the denominator of @xmath362 in ( [ g ] ) and so existence of the continued fraction is related to the problem considered before . for @xmath344 , eq .",
    "( [ cfeq ] ) has no solutions and so the continued fraction does not converge . to see from the previous context why this is the case we introduce @xmath363 in ( [ diffconst ] ) such that @xmath364 .",
    "thus , @xmath365 and one sees the close relationship between equation ( [ diffconst ] ) and continued fractions . for @xmath344 solutions",
    "are oscillating , and so is @xmath52 , so the continued fraction does not exist . for @xmath366 , on the other hand , @xmath367 and the continued fraction is well - defined .    in particular , if we assume @xmath368 then @xmath369 from ( [ roots ] ) . for finite @xmath55 and",
    "if sufficiently many steps are taken , @xmath370 is almost @xmath371 independent , and so very close to @xmath325 .",
    "we start with the solution to ( [ diffconst ] ) for @xmath321 , @xmath373 which is @xmath374 we pick @xmath47 in a such way that we have @xmath109 in terms of initial values at @xmath375 and @xmath376 , say : @xmath377 .",
    "to obtain @xmath378 in terms of the initial values , we shift the label from @xmath55 to @xmath379 and choose @xmath47 such that @xmath380 , i.e.@xmath381 .",
    "thus , @xmath382 implying @xmath383 because on the right hand side we have initial values , the progress of the sequence is constant . in the special case @xmath384 ,",
    "the progress is zero and solutions are constant .",
    "so solutions in the case @xmath345 are in general linearly growing ( except for one choice of initial values ) .",
    "this should be compared with the oscillating nature for @xmath385 and exponential growth for @xmath386 .",
    "as we have already remarked , @xmath387 is a critical point of the asymptotic equation , resembling critical points of differential equations .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss how the general procedure to find bounded solutions works here . for the subset @xmath149 we have @xmath388 from which the condition @xmath389 for a positive solution follows , and thus we must have @xmath390 in the limit @xmath233 . using our previous approach with the function @xmath177 and noting that @xmath391 we have @xmath392 , reproducing @xmath390 .",
