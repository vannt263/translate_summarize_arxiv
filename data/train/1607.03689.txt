    "the compton wavelength @xmath4 gives the minimum radius within which the mass of a particle may be localized due to relativistic quantum effects , neglecting the particle s self - gravity , while the schwarzschild radius @xmath5 gives the maximum radius within which the mass of a black hole may be localized due to classical relativistic gravity , neglecting quantum effects . in a mass - radius diagram , the two lines intersect near the planck point @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the planck mass and @xmath14 the planck length , so that relativistic - quantum - gravitational effects become significant in this region .",
    "in addition , the equivalence of the compton and schwarzschild radii close to the planck scales suggests that a final theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) should yield a unified description of fundamental particles and black holes .",
    "nonetheless , how such a unification could be achieved may be considered an outstanding problem for both elementary particle physics , and the physics of black holes , even in the absence of a final theory .    since",
    "canonical _ non - gravitational _ qm and quantum field theories ( qfts ) are based on the concept of wave - particle duality , encapsulated in the de broglie relations , these may break down close to @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is unclear what ( if any ) physical interpretation can be given to quantum particles with energies @xmath15 , since these correspond to  matter waves \" with sub - planckian wavelengths @xmath16 and time periods @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , according to canonical quantum dispersion relations . on the other hand ,",

    ", the semi - newtonian theory is defined as the newtonian limit of general relativity , in which space and time are absolute but there exists a cosmic speed limit @xmath22 , which must be imposed  by hand \" on the quantum sector .",
    "though , from the viewpoint of a final theory , this is _ clearly _ inadequate , it has the advantage of allowing us to describe key phenomenological features of spherically symmetric systems on both halves on the mass - radius diagram , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , within a unified ontological framework . in other words , using the same set of assumptions about the nature of space and time , the finite speed of light , and the form of the quantum dispersion relations , we recover well - known features of both canonical qm and classical gravity .",

    "the essence of quantum theory is wave - particle duality .",
    "though , philosophically , a somewhat slippery concept @xcite , it is encapsulated mathematically in a very precise form via the de broglie relations @xcite @xmath26 in 1924 , de broglie s great insight was to relate the constants of motion of a classical point particle , energy @xmath27 and momentum @xmath28 , with properties hitherto associated only with waves ; frequency @xmath29 and wavelength @xmath30 , or , equivalently , angular frequency @xmath31 and wave number @xmath32 .",
    "this was made possible by planck s earlier discovery of new fundamental constant with dimensions of action , @xmath33 , which proved necessary to explain the observed spectrum of black body radiation .",
    "the quantization of absorbed and emitted radiation , according to eq .",
    "( [ debroglie ] ) , was able to account for the suppression of high - energy modes that otherwise result in an  ultraviolet catastrophe \" @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough leading , ultimately , to the development of modern quantum mechanics ( qm ) and quantum field theory ( qft ) came when de broglie proposed that the relations ( [ debroglie ] ) were applicable to _ all _ forms of matter and radiation .",
    "thus , the foundation of _ any _ quantum theory is the quantum dispersion relation , which is obtained by substituting ( [ debroglie ] ) into the classical relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in general",
    ", this may be relativistic or non - relativistic and may apply to objects with zero or nonzero rest mass .",
    "typically , the latter are considered  particles \" in the classical theory and acquire wave - like characteristics via quantization , whereas the former are considered classically as ",
    "waves \" , which acquire particle - like properties via ( [ debroglie ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion ( eom ) for the quantum state must satisfy the dispersion relation obtained by combining the classical energy - momentum relation with the de broglie relations and be invariant under the symmetries of the corresponding classical theory .    for massive particles ,",
    "the quantum dispersion relation involves @xmath0 and will also include @xmath1 , the speed of light , if the theory is relativistic . roughly speaking , we may say that a theory describing massive particles is quantum ( meaning it incorporates wave - particle duality ) and non - relativistic if its dispersion relation contains , @xmath0 but not @xmath1 , and if the resulting eom are invariant under rotations , translations in time and space , and local gallilean boosts . likewise , a theory of massive particles is quantum and relativistic if its dispersion relation contains both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and if the resulting eom are invariant under the action of the poinc ' are group , comprising rotations , translations and local lorentz boosts .",

    "this , in turn , is key to the interpretation of qm as a probabilistic theory , and the entire formalism of canonical qm can be defined in terms of four basic postulates that relate its mathematical structure to the outcomes of physical measurements @xcite .",

    "the state space is a manifold and the invariance of an arbitrary state under a given isometry leads to existence of a conserved charge @xmath76 via noether s theorem @xcite . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the state space is a vector space and the invariance of an arbitrary state under the same isometry gives rise to the canonical commutation relation involving @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the discussion above gives a brief account of the logical development of the formalism of canonical non - relativistic qm . for our current purposes ,",
    "the key point is that , no matter how abstract this formalism appears , its fundamental physical _ root _ is the association of particle and wave properties according to ( [ debroglie ] ) .",
    "the precise form of the dispersion relation ( [ non_rel_disp ] ) , eom ( [ schrodinger ] ) , commutation relations ( [ sup ] ) , and state space ( hilbert space ) structure , follow from the way in which the de broglie relations are combined with the energy - momentum relation for a point - particle in newtonian mechanics ( [ non_rel_e - p ] ) . crucially , this approach _ ignores _ the effect of the particle s self - gravity , even in the newtonian limit .      in the relativistic case ,",
    "the classical energy - momentum relation for a _ free _ particle is @xmath78 combining this with ( [ debroglie ] ) , the quantum dispersion relation is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath4 is the compton wavelength .",
    "this is the length - scale that can be naturally associated with the particle s rest mass using the constants @xmath81 and @xmath1 and may be interpreted as the minimum possible radius of a quantum  particle \" of mass @xmath6 .",
    "( the quantity @xmath82 is known as the reduced compton wavelength . ) in this case , the corresonding eom is _ not _ unique , and depends on several factors , including :    * the explicit form in which the quantum dispersion relation is written , i.e. as on the left - hand or right - hand side of eq . ( [ rel_disp ] ) . * the gauge symmetries  in addition to the poinc ' are symmetry of the minkowski space background  under which the action of the corresponding classical theory is invariant .    a fundamental difference between this and the non - relativistic case is the existence of two solution branches , which seem to give rise to particles with both positive and negative energy .",
    "furthermore , although the two forms of the energy - momentum relation given in ( [ rel_e - p ] ) are classically equivalent , this equivalence does not extend to the corresponding quantum eom , obtained via the substitutions @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "in other words , the two forms of the dispersion relation given on the left - hand and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ rel_disp ] ) are quantum mechanically _",
    "inequivalent_.    an example of an eom satisfying the left - hand (  squared \" ) form of the dispersion relation is the klein - gordon equation @xcite , @xmath85 which may be generalized to describe a wave function moving in a potential @xmath86 by adding the term @xmath87 .",
    "equation ( [ kg ] ) obeys both poinc ' are symmetry and the local @xmath88 gauge symmetry of the complex scalar @xmath48 , which gives rise to a conserved electric current .",
    "it describes spinless , electrically charged , relativistic quantum particles , but is _ not _ the eom for a fully self - consistent theory of a quantum one - particle state .",
    "though the mathematical subtleties are complex , the physical reason for this is simple : no such theory exists . in fully self - consistent theories ( qfts ) , negative energy states given by the right - hand side of ( [ rel_e - p ] ) may be reinterpreted as positive energy particles under charge inversion ( @xmath89 ) , so that relativistic quantum theories predict the existence of anti - matter .",
    "states with @xmath90 then lead to the the production of particle  anti - particle pairs , giving rise to multi - particle states that conserve electric charge @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the classical inequality @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath91 in the quantum picture , so that pair - production occurs when the size of a local field oscillation becomes smaller than the compton wavelength .",
    "this gives rise to an effective cut - off for the spread of the wave packet in the non - relativistic theory , @xmath92 , so that the hup ( [ hup ] ) implies @xmath93 hence , while the de broglie wavelength of an object marks the length - scale at which non - relativistic quantum effects become important for its description , and the classical concept of a particle gives way to the wave packet , the compton wavelength marks the point at which relativistic quantum effects become significant and the concept of a single wave packet corresponding to a state in which particle number remains fixed breaks down .",
    "this acts as an effective minimum width because , for de broglie modes with @xmath91 , we must switch to a field description in which particle creation occurs in place of further spatial localization .",
    "by contrast , the right - hand (  square root \" ) form of the quantum dispersion relation gives rise , _ uniquely _ , to the dirac equation , from which the original prediction of anti - matter was derived @xcite .",
    "this may be written in a manifestly lorentz invariant form as @xmath94 where @xmath95 are space - time indices and @xmath96 denotes a set of @xmath97 matrices @xmath98 , \\ \\ \\",

    "the dirac equation describes spin-@xmath102 , electrically charged , relativistic quantum particles .",
    "crucially , it also enables us to explain the ( otherwise mysterious ) property of quantum mechanical spin as a necessary consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "it is straightforward to show that  squaring \" the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) gives the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) and that taylor expanding this  using an appropriate definition of the  square root \" of a differential operator ",
    "yields the schr \" odinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "in fully consistent qfts , the klein - gordon equation also reemerges as the eom governing the components of _ all _ free ( i.e. non - interacting ) quantum fields .",
    "the solutions of the free field eom are used to build the state space  in this case , a fock space @xcite  of the theory , since these form a basis that spans the space .",
    "hence , while integer spin particles may obey _ any _ eom that is consistent with the  squared \" form of the quantum dispersion relation , together with the other requirements of the theory , such as gauge invariance , etc . , particles with half - integer spin always obey the dirac equation , or its generalization to include interactions with electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , since only _ two _ quantum mechanically inequivalent forms of the dispersion relation exist , there are only _ two _ types of quantum relativistic particle : bosons and fermions .    in the field theory approach ,",
    "the classical field variables become quantum operators , so that , for example , a scalar field @xmath103 and its canonical momentum @xmath104 satisfy the relation @xcite @xmath105 = i\\hbar\\delta^{3}(x - x')\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is equivalent to the map @xmath106}{i\\hbar } = \\left\\{\\phi(x),\\pi(x)\\right\\ } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the classical poisson bracket .",
    "thus , equations like ( [ canon_comm_rel_qft ] ) represent the field theory analogue of the canonical quantization of point particles , ( [ quantization_scheme ] ) .",
    "the discussion in this subsection gives a brief account of the logical development of relativistic qm and a very brief introduction to some of the basic concepts of qft .",
    "we have seen that anti - matter , bosons and fermions , the existence of the compton wavelength and pair - production arise as necessary consequences of any theory that successfully incorporates both wave - particle duality  encapsulated in the de broglie relations ( [ debroglie ] )  and local lorentz invariance . though the field replaces the particle as the fundamental object to be",
    " quantized \" , and multiple excitations are interpreted as multi - particle states @xcite , the time - evolution of each excitation remains consistent with the point - particle dispersion relation ( [ rel_disp ] ) . for our current purposes",
    "the key point is that , no matter how complex or abstract the mathematical formulation of realistic qfts  including the @xmath108 gauge theories of the standard model of particle physics  become , their basic architecture _ must _ be compatible with the dispersion relation ( [ rel_disp ] ) , which follows directly from combining the de broglie relations with the energy - momentum relation for a point - particle in special relativity .",
    "again , this approach _ ignores _ the effect of the particle s self - gravity , which , in the relativistic regime , must be described by einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "by our previous logic , a crude definition of a gravitational theory is any set of eom involving newton s constant @xmath2 that reduce to einstein s field equations ( efes ) in an appropriate limit .",

    "all physically observable quantities must be continuous , including at the transition point between quantum particles and quantum black holes ( i.e. , close to the planck point ) . * the basic mathematical structure of canonical qm , and its relation to measurements of physical observables , must be preserved .",

    "the time - evolution given by the new eom , corresponding to the modified dispersion relation , must be unitary .",

    "crucially , the approximation @xmath425 is valid for spherically symmetric systems , in which it is also reasonable to make the identification @xmath428 .",
    "( in fact , it may be argued that identifying the momentum uncertainty with the rest mass is valid _ only _ in the rest frame of the system , under conditions of spherical symmetry . )",
    "hence , the modified commutator ( [ hossenfelder-1 ] ) is _ potentially _ capable of yielding a unified compton - schwarzschild line of the form ( [ gup_compton ] ) under the identification @xmath428 , but , for reasons we now address , such an identification is not possible for arbitrary @xmath6 .    in @xcite , the modified dispersion relations giving rise to eqs .",

    "we also note that the modified commutator and dispersion relations proposed in @xcite do not alter the fundamental newtonian nature of space and time ( subject to the cosmic speed limit @xmath3 ) , since they leave the fundamental commutator between the @xmath441 and @xmath442 operators unchanged , @xmath443 = i\\delta^{i}{}_{j } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath444 what has changed is , instead , is the the intrinsic relation between @xmath223 and @xmath220 , i.e. the functional form of @xmath445 .",
    "thus , in this case , the generators of infitesimal translations in the gallilean symmetry group may still be identified with the @xmath446 operators ; translation invariance gives rise to conserved noether charges for _ classical _ systems , the components of the classical momentum @xmath447 , _ and _ to a set of nontrivial commutators ( [ hossenfelder-5 ] ) for quantum systems .",
    "however , the hermitian operators @xmath448 are no longer directly proportional to the de broglie wave number operators @xmath446 , due to the more complex form of the modified de broglie relations ( [ hossenfelder-5 ] ) . as with the extended de",
    "broglie relations presented in secs .",
    "[ sec.4]-[sec.6 ] , these remain the essence of the non - trivial modifications to the quantum sector .",
    "( similar arguments apply regarding time translational symmetry , the frequency operator @xmath449 , and the classical energy @xmath27 , though the subject to the caveat that time @xmath136 is parameter , _ not _ an operator , in both canonical qm and the modified theories presented here . )    hence , considering the gup , together with momentum conservation arguments that give rise to the approximate identifications ( [ mass - assoc ] ) in the two mass regimes , is phenomenologically equivalent to using the hup together with the associations @xmath450 which are assumed to be valid for _ all _ @xmath6 .",
    "this makes sense , intuitively , since it relates the positional and momentum uncertainty of quantum - gravitational system to the adm mass @xcite .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ mass - assoc * ] ) gives rise to a unified compton - schwarzschild line that is ( at least ) _ qualitatively _ similar to the effective mass - dependence of @xmath188 , introduced via the extended de broglie theory given in secs .",
    "[ sec.4]-[sec.6 ] . in the latter ,",
    "however , the rest mass is directly associated with the minimum uncertainty of a _ modified _",
    "momentum operator @xmath451 ( [ x_max_m>>m_p ] ) .",
    "the arguments presented here suggest that this _ can not _ be identified with the physical recoil of the black hole during the hawking emission of a fundamental particle .",
    "another crucial difference between the two approaches is that the modified de broglie relations proposed in @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ hossenfelder-4 ] ) , predict an _ almost _ unique quantum state for _ all _ black holes , since @xmath452 for @xmath453 and @xmath454 for @xmath15 .",
    "this is a direct result of the fundamental asymmetry between the form of the relations ( [ hossenfelder-4 ] ) for @xmath182 and @xmath183 . by contrast , the extended de broglie theory presented in secs .",
    "[ sec.4]-[sec.6 ] explicitly incorporates the symmetry between fundamental particles and black holes present in the @xmath181 diagram , via the extensions of the relations themselves . in this scenario",
    ", the unique quantum state @xmath455 $ ] corresponds to the unique physical state for which schwarzschild radius is equal to the compton wavelength .",
    "a related point concerns the fact that _ all _ forms of modified quantum mechanics proposed thus far in the literature  be they based directly on gup phenomenology or on modified de broglie relations  give rise to uncertainty relations of the form @xmath456 , even when these are extended to systems with super - planckian rest mass .",
    "this is the mathematical expression of the assumption that the radius of a black hole is , in some sense , physically equivalent to the radius of fundamental particle , i.e. that it may be considered as a minimum , rather than as a maximum limit on rest mass localisation .",
    "were @xmath48 to represent ( in some limit ) the wave function associated with the mass in the interior of a black hole , it may be argued that a modified quantum theory giving rise to a positional uncertainty of the form @xmath457 is required .",
    "it would be interesting to consider how such a theory could be reconciled with the  horizon wave function \" model , proposed by casadio _",
    "et al _ ( see , for example @xcite ) , as even an effective wave function model of a black hole may require _ both _ components .",
    "we have shown that , by taking the semi - newtonian approximation , in which space and time remain absolute but a cosmic speed limit @xmath3 is imposed  by hand \" , we can recover essential phenomenological features of both relativistic quantum theory and relativistic gravity from their non - relativistic counterparts . applying this approximation to the basic mathematical structure of canonical qm yields the formula for the compton wavelength , via the uncertainty principle , while applying it to newtonian gravity yields the schwarzschild radius , via the formula for the escape velocity . on a plot of mass versus radius ,",
    "these lines meet at the planck point , suggesting that the final theory of quantum gravity should yield a unified description of fundamental particles and black holes . in the absence of such a theory",
    ", we propose a na \" i ve unification , based on recognition of the fact that both sets of objects may be adequately described in the semi - newtonian regime .",
    "since the canonical qm dispersion relations break down for planck mass objects , our new theory is based on modified de broglie relations , which , when substituted into the classical energy - momentum relation , yield quantum dispersion relations that hold for systems of arbitrary mass .",
    "these , in turn , give rise to modified eom , hamiltonian , momentum and time - evolution operators , in both the particle and black hole sectors . in each sector",
    ", the time - evolution is non - canonical , but unitary , and the particle evolution reduces to canonical form in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the new dispersion relations depend on all three fundamental constants , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and their chosen form gives rise to a new mass - dependence in the phenomenologically significant length scale of the theory .",
    "this reduces to the compton radius for extreme low - mass objects , but corresponds to the schwarzschild radius in the opposite extreme .",
    "we therefore interpret the additional terms in the modified dispersion relations as representing the self - gravity of the quantum wave packet in the semi - newtonian picture .",
    "in addition , our work suggests a natural definition for the  compton temperature \" of a fundamental particle .",
    "this bears the same relation to the compton wavelength as does the hawking temperature of a black hole to its schwarzschild radius , and may be interpreted as the temperature associated with the particle s rest mass . in the extended de broglie theory ,",
    "the two lines , plotted as functions of mass on a log - log plot , define asymptotes to a unified temperature curve , which interpolates between the particle and black hole regions . in this formulation , a planck mass object",
    "is represented by a unique quantum state , whose de broglie wavelength , compton wavelength and schwarzschild radius are equal to the planck length , and whose temperature is equal to the planck temperature .    the pedagogical discussions in secs .",

    "this probabilistic information is represented mathematically by a vector @xmath61 in a complex hilbert space @xmath458 that forms the _ state space _ of the theory . in",

    "these four postulates define the general framework within which it has so far been possible to describe _ all _ canonical qm systems @xcite .",
    "we note that postulate 4 is _ equivalent _ to assuming that the operators representing physical observables are defined by analogy with their classical equivalents , together with the assumption that the usual de broglie relations ( [ debroglie ] ) hold . if these relations are changed , but we retain the analogous classical / quantum formulae , the dispersion relation for the de broglie waves , and hence the eom for the quantum system , are also altered .",
