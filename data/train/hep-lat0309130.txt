    "quantum chromodynamics has well established phase transitions in certain limiting cases . in the limit of vanishing quark masses",
    "it has the chiral phase transition from the phase of broken chiral symmetry at low temperatures to the chiral symmetric phase at high temperatures . in the limit of infinite quark masses",
    "one finds the deconfinement transition from the @xmath1-symmetric low temperature phase with confinement to the @xmath1-broken phase at high temperatures , for a review see @xcite . for physical quark masses",
    "@xmath2 of the order of @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 of the order of @xmath5 mev it is suggested by lattice simulations  @xcite and effective models  @xcite that neither a chiral nor a deconfinement transition occurs in the sense that there are thermodynamic singularities .",
    "lattice gauge theory investigations of the finite temperature phase transitions of qcd have , with some notable exceptions  @xcite , been limited to studies of their equilibrium properties , whereas in nature these transitions are governed by a temperature , or otherwise , driven dynamics . even when a proper phase transition does not exist , a question is whether one may expect observable remnants of the phase conversion because of off - equilibrium effects .    in the early universe",
    "the effects of the dynamics are most likely negligible , since the cooling process is determined by the hubble expansion of the universe that is slow compared to the typical time scales of strong interactions , which are of the order of @xmath6 sec . in heavy ion collisions",
    "this is different . a rapid heating ( quench ) of the nuclei at the `` little bang '' event",
    "is followed by a slower cooling process .",
    "the lifetime of the emerging system appears to be sufficiently long to equilibrate a phenomenological quark - gluon plasma  @xcite , although the dynamics in the time period of the phase conversion may proceed out of equilibrium .",
    "finite size corrections may play a role , because the system is not large compared to the typical spatial scale of strong interactions , i.e. 1  fm .",
    "one should also address the question , whether the initial quench could lead to domains of distinct average @xmath7 3-ality , with interfaces between them , which have relatively long relaxation times .    on an effective level ( in the framework of the @xmath8-model ) one",
    "has studied dynamical effects on the chiral phase transition  @xcite .",
    "although the largest equilibrium correlation length ( that of the pion with a mass of @xmath9 ) is not large compared to the intrinsic qcd scale ( e.g. , set by @xmath10 ) , as result of a quenched cooling process one may get disoriented chiral condensates via spinodal decomposition .",
    "we are interested in the analogous question for the deconfinement transition  @xcite .",
    "one could get a disoriented condensate of polyakov  @xcite loops and an associated production of low - momentum gluons .",
    "polyakov loops behave effectively like @xmath11 spin variables  @xcite and the potts - model in three dimensions with @xmath12 states gives an effective description of the deconfinement transition ( more sophisticated spin models are also considered  @xcite ) . by adding an external field  @xcite",
    ", one can represent the effect of finite quark masses .",
    "even this simplification is not yet a suitable basis for a numerical investigation .",
    "to get confidence in our computational methods , we simulated @xmath13-state potts models in @xmath0 , for which a number of rigorous results  @xcite allow for cross checks .",
    "we set the external field to zero and choose @xmath14 and @xmath3 , corresponding to a weak second order , a strong second order , a weak first order and a strong first order phase transition , respectively .",

    "we use hysteresis methods to investigate the phase transition in the glauber  @xcite dynamics .",
    "the universality class of glauber dynamics , model  a in the classification of ref.@xcite , contains local monte carlo ( mc ) updating schemes which imitate the thermal fluctuations of nature .",
    "studying the computer time evolution of glauber dynamics gives an overview of a scenario which allows for a variation of the speed of the phase transition .",

    ", one has to find a way to re - introduce a proper dynamics .",
    "the hope is that the thus generated configurations are typical for the dynamical process .",

    "the results from equilibrium configurations are compared with those from configurations that are dynamically driven through the hysteresis cycles . in all cases",
    "we find that the dynamics induces remarkably strong signals for a spinodal decomposition . with increasing @xmath13 similar signals",

    "our ( computer ) time - dependent hamiltonian is @xmath15 where @xmath16 here the sum runs over all nearest neighbor sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 takes the values @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we rely on symmetric lattices of @xmath21 spins .",
    "for suitably chosen values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we run the system at various cooling / heating rates in cycles from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and back .",
    "hysteresis methods played some role in the early days of lattice gauge theory  @xcite , but have apparently been abandoned .",
    "possibly , the reason is that one does not learn much from a single hysteresis .",
    "however , averages over large numbers of heating and cooling cycles have to our knowledge not been analyzed in the literature . by creating a large number of cycles , ensemble averages of dynamical configurations",
    "are obtained at selected temperatures @xmath24 .",
    "for each temperature away from the endpoint of the cycles two distinct averages exist , one on the heating and the other on the cooling branch of the cycles .",
    "the spins are updated by an algorithm which is within the glauber class .",
    "examples are single- and multi - hit metropolis , as well as heat - bath updating methods , where the lattice sites may be visited randomly or in some systematic order . at critical points",
    "( i.e. at second order transitions ) the slowing down of such algorithms is governed by universal exponents .",
    "a counterexample is the swendsen - wang  @xcite algorithm , which updates entire fk clusters .",
    "clearly , such an updating does not correspond to thermal fluctuations of nature .",
    "the purpose of the swendsen - wang algorithm is to speed up the dynamics of second order phase transitions in computer simulations .    when driving the system through the transition , the phase conversion may be dominated by metastable or unstable states of matter .",
    "if a system is brought into a metastable state , it will be unstable against finite , localized fluctuation .",
    "this scenario is called _",
    "nucleation_. it may allow the system to reach a metastable equilibrium before a large enough fluctuations occurs . if the system is brought into an unstable state , infinitesimal , non - localized amplitude fluctuations lead to an immediate onset of the decay of the unstable state .",
    "this scenario is called _",
    "spinodal decomposition_. it may lead to long - range correlations , in a sense similar to those encountered in equilibrium close to second order phase transitions .",
    "the concept of nucleation as well as the spinodal were first introduced by gibbs as early as 1877 , where the spinodal was defined as a limit for metastability of fluid gases .",
    "but only in the late 1950s it became apparent that a phase beyond the spinodal decomposes by diffusional clustering mechanism quite different from the nucleation and growth mechanism encountered for metastable states . in his classic review  @xcite cahn includes an account of the historical development .",
    "the modern theory uses effective diffusional differential equations ( originally an idea of hillert  @xcite ) to distinguish dynamical universality classes , see ref.@xcite for reviews . a sharp distinction between infinitesimal ( spinodal ) and finite ( nucleation ) fluctuations",
    "is , strictly speaking , a mean field concept . in real systems , where fluctuations are important",
    ", the boundary separating nucleation from spinodal decomposition is not perfectly sharp .",
    "the numerical investigations , we are aware off , investigate the spinodal versus the nucleation scenario after a quench , which may either lead into the metastable region ( nucleation ) or beyond it ( spinodal decomposition ) . see miller and ogilvie  @xcite in the context of lattice gauge theory .",
    "our hysteresis approach differs in this respect .",
    "the continued change of the external temperature prevents the system from ever reaching equilibrium , but implies on the other hand a smoother dynamics , because the temperature changes only in small steps . under laboratory conditions",
    "there is never a perfect quench and in some situations our hysteresis approach may allow to model laboratory condition more realistically than a quench .",
    "we measured many observables in each hysteresis cycle . in this paper",
    "we report selected results for the energy , fk clusters and structure functions . in more detail",
    "the data will be analyzed and presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "we measure fk clusters instead of geometrical clusters , because their statistical definition accounts for the fact that neighboring spins may not only be aligned by the spontaneous magnetization but also by random fluctuations .",
    "it is only then that the kertesz  @xcite line of percolation coincides with the phase transition , see ref.@xcite for a review of this and related topics .",
    "in contrast to the stochastic definition , the geometric definition connects aligned spins with certainty and leads to an overcounting of ordered clusters . while the fk works well for potts models , a generalization to gauge theories",
    "is not known .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that a cluster updating algorithm is not known for gauge theories .",
    "we are interested in the effects of dynamic heating and cooling on the cluster structure , in particular in the question , whether one may still find observable signals , even when their is no longer a transition in the strict thermodynamic sense .",
    "there are similarities and differences to the program of satz  @xcite .",
    "satz focuses on geometric properties of fk clusters and would like to extract from their equilibrium distribution signals for the phase conversion when there is no proper phase transition .",
    "we are trying to find signals for the phase conversion due to the deviations from equilibrium .",
    "for nucleation one expects compact clusters , due to the non - zero interfacial tension between the ordered and the disordered phase . for spinodal decomposition clusters of each of the ordered states will grow unrestricted by such an interfacial tension , building domain walls between the distinct ordered states . for nucleation",
    "we expect the maximum cluster surface to grow to a size @xmath25 with @xmath26 for strong first oder transitions ( @xmath27 for the smallest surface of a cluster which percolates ) . for spinodal decomposition",
    "we expect considerably larger values , comparable to the largest values one finds on equilibrium configurations in the neighborhood of a second order phase transition .",
    "in our simulations we record the following cluster observables : their number , the mean volume , the maximum volume , the mean surface area , the maximum surface area , the gyration radius and the percolation probability .",
    "the volume of a cluster is simply the number of spins it contains .",
    "the cluster surface is defined on the links of the dual lattice , which corresponds to the @xmath28 dimensional hyperspace of the original lattice .",
    "the percolation probability @xmath29 is the probability to find at least one cluster that percolates . for our periodic lattices",
    "this means that the cluster connects to itself through the boundary conditions , in any one of the two directions .",
    "we analyze the structure function in momentum space for signals of spinodal decomposition .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the magnetization in direction @xmath31 . by introducing a potts spin @xmath32 we can write the correlation function @xmath33 in the familiar form @xmath34 the structure factor ( function ) is the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 .",
    "some straightforward algebra transforms this into @xmath37\\right|^2\\right\\rangle\\\\ \\label{sf }   & - & \\delta_{\\vec{k},0 } \\sum_{q_0 } m_{q_0}^2\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is simply the time - dependent version of the equilibrium structure factor . in condensed matter experiments the magnitude of the structure function is directly observable in x - ray , neutron and light scattering experiments , compare , e.g. , ref .",
    "unfortunately , it appears to us that direct measurements in high energy experiments are unrealistic . in our simulations",
    "we expect pronounced peaks ( similar as for equilibrium configuration near second order phase transitions ) for @xmath38 in the case of a phase conversion by spinodal decomposition and no such signals in the case of a conversion by nucleation and growth .",
    "the data presented in this paper rely on systematic updating for which the potts spins are updated in sequential order , each spin once during one sweep .",
    "we did a number of cross - checks using random updating for which the spins are updated in random order , in the average each spin once during one sweep .",
    "besides a slowing down of the dynamics by a factor of about 0.6 for random updating , we observed no noticeable changes of the results checked .",
    "the temperature @xmath39 is changed by @xmath40 after every sweep ( we experimented also with temperature changes after each spin update and found no differences within our statistical errors ) .",
    "our stepsize @xmath41 is proportional to the inverse volume of the system @xmath42 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 define the terminal temperatures and the integer @xmath43 is varied .",
    "equilibrium configurations are recovered in the limit @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . in nature the fluctuations per spin per time",
    "unit ( here the unit of one mc sweep ) set the scale for the dynamics .",
    "our choice of @xmath41 is motivated by our interest in the question whether a dynamics , which slows down with volume size may still dominate the nature of the transition .",
    "relying on the heat - bath method , each of our systems is driven through at least 640 cycles , each starting from an equilibrated , disordered configuration .",
    "error bars are calculated with respect to 32 jackknife bins . in an exploratory simulation  @xcite of @xmath0 potts models",
    "the metropolis algorithm was employed , but it turns out that the heat - bath method saves cpu time . in this article",
    "we simulate the @xmath0 @xmath13-state potts model for @xmath46 , 4 , 5 and 10 .",
    "this allows us to compare the influence of the glauber dynamics for a weak second order , a strong second order , a weak first order and a strong first order phase transition .",
    "our terminology `` strong second order phase transition '' may need some explanation .",
    "for a finite system of volume @xmath47 the partition functions is a polynomial in @xmath48 that takes positive values on the real axis . for first and second order phase transitions the imaginary part of the partition function s zero closest to the real axis scales like @xmath49 , where @xmath50 for a first order transition and @xmath51 for a second order transition .",
    "the fluctuations of the energy are governed by the exponent @xmath52 of the specific heat for which we assume the hyperscaling relation  @xcite @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 for first order transitions and @xmath55 for second order transitions .",
    "to determine the implications for the finite size scaling of the energy fluctuations , we use the link expectation value of the energy @xmath56 where @xmath17 and @xmath57 are nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the values of @xmath58 are conveniently located in the range @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . to leading order in @xmath62 , finite size scaling theory",
    "predicts the fluctuation of @xmath58 to scale like @xmath63 for @xmath64 at the transition point @xmath65 . for first order phase transitions @xmath54 holds and the left - hand - side of equation  ( [ sigma_e_l ] ) approaches a finite value , proportional to the square of the latent heat @xmath66 . for second order phase transitions the left - hand - side scales to zero . in this sense",
    "a weak second order transition is one with @xmath52 close to zero or @xmath67 and a cusp or logarithmic singularity , while a strong second order transition has @xmath52 close to one .",
    "first order transitions are weak when @xmath68 holds and strong when @xmath66 becomes of order one , say from @xmath69 on . for our choices of @xmath13",
    "the analytical values  @xcite of @xmath70 , @xmath52 and @xmath66 are compiled in table  [ tab_potts ] .",
    "our values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for equation  ( [ delta_beta ] ) and a numerical result , @xmath71 , as explained in the following subsection , are also given in this table .    .",
    "the ( infinite volume ) phase transition temperatures @xmath65 , the specific heat exponent @xmath52 and the latent heats of selected @xmath13-state potts models in two dimensions . for the latent heats the negative energy per link @xmath66 is given and @xmath71 is an estimate from hysteresis cycles .",
    "[ tab_potts ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in steps of 20 our lattice sizes range from @xmath72 to @xmath73 . for the smaller systems",
    "all hysteresis runs are done on a single pc , while for the larger lattices up to 32 pcs are used , dividing our entire run in 32 bins of at least 20 hysteresis loops each . in each case a short equilibrium run of @xmath74 sweeps was initially performed at @xmath22 , where the systems equilibrate easily , because they are highly disordered . for comparison with equilibrium configurations we performed multicanonical  @xcite ( see the next subsection ) as well as conventional , canonical simulations .",
    "the reason for the conventional canonical equilibrium simulations is that one needs to know the temperature to generate fk clusters .",
    "they were performed at many temperatures and in each case 640 measurements were taken after at least @xmath75 sweeps for reaching equilibrium .      for a first order phase transition , the slowing down of the canonical equilibrium markov process is exponential in computer time , @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 is the interfacial tension ( see  @xcite for the analytical values ) . in this case",
    "we expect an energy hysteresis to survive in the limit @xmath78 and @xmath79 for any fixed value of @xmath80 in equation  ( [ delta_beta ] ) .",
    "the shape of the hysteresis can then be used to define finite volumes estimators of physical variables , such as the transition temperature and the latent heat .",
    "the infinite volume limits of these estimators are supposed to be independent of any fixed choice of @xmath80 .    for the second order phase transitions of the @xmath46 and @xmath81 models",
    "the analysis is more subtle .",
    "the markov process slows only down like @xmath82 with @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one still expects a hysteresis in the limit @xmath78 and @xmath80 fixed , only the opening has no longer the interpretation of a finite volume estimator of the equilibrium latent heat .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis of the hysteresis as function of @xmath84 should allow to identify second order transitions .",
    "this analysis is not pursued here . for @xmath85 and selected lattice sizes we show in figure  [ fig_hys_e ] our energy  ( [ e_l ] ) hysteresis data .",
    "the ordinate is scaled to @xmath86 so that , independently of @xmath13 , the range @xmath87 $ ] gets covered when @xmath64 is varied from @xmath88 . if one wants to compare the present heat bath with metropolis results  @xcite , the better efficiency of the heat bath algorithm is such that @xmath89 ought to be used . from left to right in figure  [ fig_hys_e ]",
    "hysteresis loops for the cases @xmath46 , 4 , 5 and  10 are visible . for clarity of the figure",
    "we have omitted error bars and for @xmath81 and  5 also the @xmath90 and @xmath91 lattices .",
    "notable is that the hysteresis curves for the @xmath81 strong second order transition and the @xmath92 weak first order transition are quite similar . from @xmath93 to @xmath46",
    "there is a gradual , not an abrupt , deformation of the shape of the hysteresis .    to analyze the physical content of the hysteresis curves of figure  [ fig_hys_e ] in more detail",
    ", we define the finite volume estimators of the inverse transition temperature @xmath94 and of the latent heat @xmath95 by their values at the maximum opening of the corresponding hysteresis curve .",
    "figure  [ fig_dele ] shows the thus obtained estimates @xmath95 together with fits of the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant . for @xmath93",
    "the left - hand - side ordinate applies and for the other @xmath13-values the right - hand - side ordinate . because of the distinct scales the difference between the @xmath93 and the @xmath92 estimators is large , while the general behavior of the fitting curve appears to be quite similar for all @xmath13-values .",
    "the obtained infinite volume estimates @xmath71 are given in table  [ tab_potts ] .",
    "for @xmath93 the estimate is in excellent agreement with the analytical result , but this is not at all the case for the other @xmath13-values . instead , the @xmath46 , 4 and  5 estimates overshoot the equilibrium values considerably",
    ". this does not come as a surprise , because we already noted that , in the infinite volume limit and for fixed @xmath80 , a finite opening of the hysteresis survives even for the second order phase transitions . obviously , the opening has no longer the interpretation of an estimator of the equilibrium latent heat .",
    "instead , the phenomenon illustrates that the dynamics tends to wash out differences of the equilibrium properties of the transitions .    performing a similar analysis for @xmath94 and comparing the infinite volume estimates with the analytical results , we get accuracies of about @xmath981% for all @xmath13 .",
    "so , we find no problem in locating the equilibrium transition temperature from the information of the dynamics .",
    "the accuracy of these dynamical estimates is not competitive with the best equilibrium methods .",
    "e.g. , fitting the pseudocritical @xmath64-values of the multicanonical 10-state potts model simulation  @xcite self - consistently to the form @xmath99 gives @xmath100 ( using our energy convention  ( [ energy ] ) ) .",
    "the purpose of our present study is not to calculate high precision estimates of equilibrium quantities , but to investigate the deviations from equilibrium due to the imposed dynamics . to understand the dynamics of our finite volume transitions in more detail , we analyze in the next two subsections the behavior of fk clusters and structure functions on our configurations .    in a last remark about the hysteresis curves of the internal energy , we like to mention that we have also generated equilibrium data for all cases using the multicanonical method .",
    "as expected , the thus obtained @xmath101 functions fall inside the hysteresis curves of figure  [ fig_hys_e ] .",
    "some more details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we limit our presentation to a few of the cluster observables we measure ( more details will be given in  @xcite ) .",
    "the largest cluster surface turns out to be interesting , because it exhibits pronounced peaks in the transition region .",
    "we use the normalization @xmath102 for our cluster surfaces . a link which connects a site of the cluster with the site of another adjacent cluster",
    "is defined to be a surface link .",
    "the surface links can be mapped on the @xmath103-dimensional hypercubes which enclose the cluster on the dual lattice .",
    "the largest surface is simply defined as @xmath104 where the maximum is taken over all clusters @xmath105 of the configuration at hand .    for the 10-state model results for the largest cluster surface of the @xmath85 hysteresis cycle",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig_q10_sm ] .",
    "the arrows indicate the flow of the hysteresis cycles . during the heating and cooling parts of the cycles , the surface areas peak at distinct values , @xmath106 .",
    "this is striking evidence that the geometry of the fk clusters is distinct during cooling and heating .",
    "due to our use of stochastic ( in contrast to geometrical ) clusters , the equilibrium transition temperature value is pinched between the temperatures at which the two peaks are located .",
    "it can be understood that the peaks of @xmath107 are related to percolation . for the @xmath108 half - cycle",
    "the picture is that the cluster with the largest surface percolates due to the periodic boundary conditions . until the cluster percolates , its surface area increases ,",
    "while it is decreasing after percolation ( as only small islands of the false phase remain eventually ) . relying on the same data as for figure  [ fig_q10_sm ] ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig_q10_prc ] the percolation probability @xmath29 .",
    "it is seen that the temperatures of the @xmath109 peaks correspond approximately to the steepest increase / decrease of the percolation probabilities .",
    "another observation from figure  [ fig_q10_sm ] is that for the half - cycle @xmath110 the peaks of @xmath109 are even more pronounced than for @xmath108 .",
    "this is in accordance with a very rapid fall - off of the percolation probability for the @xmath110 half - cycle .",
    "our interpretation is that the response to the temperature change is more rapid when the system enters the disordered phase than when it enters the ordered phase .",
    "such a change in relaxation scales may be expected for a strong first order transition ( because both phases are separated by a gap in the energy and not continuously related ) , while one would expect that the response times under heating and cooling are similar for a weak second order phase transition .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig_q02_sm ] shows that the two peaks are of almost equal height for the 2-state potts ( ising ) model .",
    "the @xmath109 results for the @xmath81 and @xmath92 models ( no figures shown ) are in - between the two scenarios , but certainly closer to @xmath93 than to @xmath46 .",
    "the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath92 is minor .    also shown in figures  [ fig_q10_sm ] and  [ fig_q02_sm ] are results for @xmath107 from equilibrium simulations on @xmath111 lattices .",
    "they are barely visible , because they are to a large extent covered by the curves of the @xmath110 half - cycle .",
    "therefore , we plot the equilibrium curves for all our @xmath13-values separately in figure  [ fig_eq_sm ] .",
    "the peaks show a marked increase from @xmath93 ( right ) to @xmath46 ( left ) . for first order phase transitions",
    "the interface tension implies that the free energy increases with the cluster surfaces .",
    "the stronger the first order transition is , the more the system tries to minimize interfaces . for a second order phase transition",
    "there is no ( disorder - order ) free energy penalty when the phases mix and the cluster surfaces become fluffy .",
    "this is quite similar to the distinct behavior of cluster surfaces under nucleation versus spinodal decomposition .",
    "the suggestion from figures  [ fig_q10_sm ] and  [ fig_q02_sm ] is then that the dynamics changes the transition scenario to spinodal for all our @xmath13-values . in these cases",
    "the heights of the peaks are quite similar to those which we find for the equilibrium peaks of the @xmath46 and @xmath81 second order transitions .",
    "the question emerges , how fast is the equilibrium scenario approached when the speed of the dynamics slows down ? in figure  [ fig_q10_smv ] we plot for @xmath85 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and  16 our @xmath107 results of the 10-state model on an @xmath112 lattice . for increasing @xmath80",
    "we observe a slight decrease of the @xmath110 peaks , while the @xmath108 peaks increase .",
    "although the peaks of the cooling and heating half - cycles approach one another in this way , each process is still far away from equilibrium as a comparison with the height of the @xmath93 equilibrium peak of figure  [ fig_eq_sm ] shows .",
    "the long tails of the peaks of the @xmath108 half - cycle decrease rather rapidly with increasing @xmath80 , so that @xmath107 approaches its equilibrium value for @xmath113 .    for @xmath46 ( no figure shown ) an approach of both peaks to the equilibrium peak of @xmath109 is observed , whose height is for @xmath46 only about 10% smaller than the height of the @xmath85 dynamical peak .",
    "we take this as an indication that in the range of our dynamical speeds the phase conversion mechanism is always spinodal , independently of the order of the equilibrium transition .",
    "figure  [ fig_1v_sm ] makes this point by contrasting the equilibrium results of figure  [ fig_eq_sm ] with the @xmath85 dynamical results . in the next subsection",
    "we analyze our structure functions data with respect to this scenario .",
    "the locations of the equilibrium peaks are closer to the @xmath114 values of the dynamical @xmath115 heating half - cycles than to the @xmath116 values of the dynamical @xmath108 cooling half - cycles .",
    "this is particularly clear for @xmath117 .",
    "our understanding of this is that the relaxation is faster for the heating than for the cooling half - cycle .",
    "this observation goes hand in hand with the interpretation of the higher peaks in figures  [ fig_q10_sm ] , [ fig_q10_smv ] and  [ fig_1v_sm ] as being due to faster response times of the systems .      during our simulations we recorded the structure function  ( [ sf ] ) for the following momenta : @xmath118 the structure functions are averaged over rotationally equivalent momenta . in the following we use the notation @xmath119 , @xmath120 for the structure function @xmath38 , when the vector @xmath121 is @xmath122 and the time dependence is dictated by @xmath123 .",
    "spinodal decomposition is characterized by an explosive growth in the low momentum modes , while the high momentum modes relax to their equilibrium values .      in figures",
    "[ fig_q10_k1 ] and  [ fig_q02_k1 ] we give the @xmath93 and @xmath46 results for @xmath125 .",
    "the hysteresis flow is indicated by the arrows .",
    "figure  [ fig_sf1k1v ] shows the @xmath13-dependence of the @xmath85 dynamics together with our equilibrium results . in comparison with the @xmath107 figures  [ fig_q10_sm ] , [ fig_q02_sm ] ,",
    "[ fig_eq_sm ] and  [ fig_1v_sm ] , several differences and similarities deserve to be mentioned :    1 .   for our @xmath80 values",
    "the @xmath126 structure functions have a pronounced maximum on the @xmath108 half - cycle .",
    "this is cooling in the spin system language used in this paper and heating ( i.e. , confinement to deconfinement ) in an analogue qcd system .",
    "different ordinate scales are chosen in figures  [ fig_q10_k1 ] and  [ fig_q02_k1 ] , because the magnitudes of the peaks show a considerable @xmath13-dependence .",
    "that is exhibited in figure  [ fig_sf1k1v ] .",
    "3 .   as in figure  [ fig_eq_sm ] for @xmath109 the equilibrium peaks of @xmath126 increase from @xmath93 to @xmath46 ( see figure  [ fig_sf1k1v ] ) . however , increasing @xmath80 from  1 to  16 , the approach of the @xmath125 function to their equilibrium is even for @xmath113 rather slow .",
    "this is shown for @xmath93 in figure  [ fig_q10_sf1kv ] . to a large extent",
    "it holds still for @xmath46 , where for @xmath113 the equilibrium appears to become approached for @xmath127 , as is shown in figure  [ fig_q02_sf1kv ] .",
    "4 .   the inlays of figures  [ fig_q10_sf1kv ] and  [ fig_q02_sf1kv ] enlarge the equilibrium peaks together with the heating ( @xmath110 ) data .",
    "for @xmath93 as well as for @xmath46 we find that the heating data develop a peak with increasing @xmath80 , which may eventually approach the equilibrium peak .",
    "however , in both cases it appears that the heating peak wants first to merge with the cooling peak .",
    "for @xmath93 the @xmath127 cooling peak is much larger than the equilibrium peak and the heating peaks are all the time increasing . eventually , both peaks should start to decrease towards the equilibrium data . for @xmath46",
    "the cooling peaks decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath80 and the @xmath127 cooling peak undershoots the equilibrium peak .",
    "cooling and heating peak move towards merging and should approach the equilibrium peak from below .",
    "the @xmath126 structure function peaks strongly under cooling and less under heating .",
    "this is presumably related to the fact that the spin variables get ordered at low temperatures ( like the polyakov loops get ordered at high temperatures ) , thus allowing for @xmath13-ality order - order domains . for our fast dynamics",
    "the @xmath126 values at @xmath23 are so high that the peaks under heating become overshadowed .",
    "this can be made explicit by first equilibrating the systems at @xmath23 .",
    "then peaks of similar size as the equilibrium peaks appear on the @xmath128 half - cycle . for our slower dynamics",
    "the @xmath125 structure function peaks for the @xmath110 half - cycle become visible without equilibrating first at @xmath23 . for increasing @xmath80",
    "they approach the equilibrium peaks ( see the inlays of figures  [ fig_q10_sf1kv ] and  [ fig_q02_sf1kv ] ) . for both half - cycles",
    "the approach to equilibrium appears to happen only for a really slow dynamics .",
    "very cpu time consuming simulations of @xmath129 values would be needed to follow this in detail .",
    "miller and ogilvie  @xcite investigated the dynamics of su(2 ) gauge theory after quenching from a low to a high physical temperature ( corresponding to the @xmath131 half - cycle of the spin system ) .",
    "they report a critical value @xmath132 , so that modes grow ( do not grow ) exponentially for @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .    in figures  [ fig_q10_sfk ] and  [ fig_q02_sfk ] we show for our @xmath85 dynamics all structure functions , which we have measured .",
    "it is notable that we observe a large gap between the peaks for @xmath135 , @xmath136 and for @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "we also performed quenching runs . in figure  [ fig_q10_quench ]",
    "we show the time evolution on an @xmath112 lattice after quenching the 10-state potts model from @xmath139 to @xmath140 and in figure  [ fig_q02_quench ] we show the time evolution after quenching the 2-state potts model from @xmath141 to @xmath142 . as in our hysteresis investigations averages of 640 independent repetitions",
    "are taken .",
    "again , we find a large gap between the peaks for @xmath135 , @xmath136 and for @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "further it is remarkable that the height of the peaks in the hysteresis cooling half - cycles and under quenching are almost identical , while the time scale is according to equation  ( [ delta_beta ] ) extended to 3200 sweeps for the hysteresis curve .    for figure  [ fig_q02_hquench ]",
    "we have changed the second order phase transition of the 2-state potts model to a crossover by adding the term @xmath143 with a small magnetic field @xmath144 , @xmath145 , with respect to the spin @xmath146 in the hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) .",
    "in essence the time evolution after quenching is similar as without the magnetic field , only that the magnitude of the @xmath126 and @xmath147 peaks decreases , maintaining still a clearly visible gap to the peaks of the @xmath148 , @xmath138 structure functions . increasing the magnetic field further , to @xmath149 , the large peaks disappear altogether by merging into the small peaks .",
    "the signal of a transition is possibly lost for such high values of the magnetic field .",
    "the observed peaks suggest a critical @xmath122 value between @xmath150 and @xmath151 for the potts models . however , the issue is more subtle .",
    "cahn - hilliard theory  @xcite ( model  b for reviews see  @xcite ) predicts an exponential growth of the low momentum structure function in the initial part of the time evolution after quenching ( also applies to model  a ) . whether such an exponential growth is found or not was used by miller and ogilvie  @xcite to determine the critical @xmath132 between the low and the high momentum mode .",
    "however , none of our structure functions in figures  [ fig_q10_quench ] to  [ fig_q02_hquench ] shows initial exponential growth .",
    "this is already kind of obvious by looking at the figures , where the shape of the increasing parts of the curves is always concave and is quantitatively determined by performing fits .",
    "a likely explanation is that the cahn - hilliard theory relies on approximations which are not justified in our @xmath0 models . in @xmath11",
    "we find exponential growth in the very early stage of the time evolution after quenching ( incrementing then @xmath64 after every update and fitting the time evolution within the first sweep  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , our hysteresis curves of figures  [ fig_q10_sfk ] and  [ fig_q02_sfk ] , which rely on the smoother dynamics of temperature changes in small steps , show an initial exponential growth .",
    "we find no peaks in the structur factors when we quench from an ordered initial state into the disordered phase . the reason may be that the structure factor is defined with respect to the order parameter . under a quench into the ordered phase @xmath13-ality order - order domain",
    "may emerge , whereas there is only one disordered phase .",
    "our energy hysteresis method allows for dynamical estimates of the equilibrium transition temperatures for first as well as for second order phase transitions .",
    "while the precision of these estimates is not competitive with those of equilibrium investigations , the hysteresis method provides information about dynamically rooted deviations of accompanying physical observables from their equilibrium values . for second order transitions",
    "we find that the dynamics generates a latent heat and for a weak first order transition we find a ` dynamical ' latent heat much larger than its equilibrium value , whereas for a strong first order transition the dynamical latent heat agrees with the equilibrium value ( the magnetization allows for a similar analysis , which is not reported here ) .    in our analysis of @xmath0 potts models , we find spinodal decomposition to be the dominant feature as soon as we turn on the dynamics .",
    "for instance , the equilibrium ( quasi static ) phase conversion of first order phase transitions is due to nucleation .",
    "even our slowest dynamics ( @xmath127 ) changes the phase conversion of the investigated weak ( @xmath92 ) and strong ( @xmath93 ) first order transitions from nucleation to spinodal . for the @xmath46 ( weak )",
    "second order transition the @xmath127 dynamics appears to be already rather close to equilibrium , which is formally reached for @xmath44 .",
    "these results are mainly based on analyzing the dynamical time evolution of fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters and structure functions .    * for fk clusters",
    "we find that the largest cluster surface area is quite sensitive to dynamical effects and yields for all considered @xmath13-values signals in favor of a spinodal decomposition on the cooling ( @xmath108 ) and heating ( @xmath110 ) half - cycles of our hysteresis loops .",
    "this may be illustrated by comparing the results of our fast ( @xmath85 ) dynamics of figure  [ fig_1v_sm ] with the equilibrium results of figure  [ fig_eq_sm ] .",
    "for the first order transitions the dynamics enhances the peak values to take on similar values as one finds for the @xmath46 and @xmath81 second order configurations near the critical point .",
    "* for the structure factor our @xmath85 dynamics leads on the @xmath131 half - cycle to amplitude maxima , which are considerably larger than those from the second order equilibrium configurations , see figure  [ fig_sf1k1v ] .",
    "the dynamical peaks on the @xmath152 half - cycle are comparable to those of from the equilibrium configurations , which has for figure  [ fig_sf1k1v ] the consequence that they are not visible at all , because the systems are still out of equilibrium at @xmath23 and on their return path .",
    "that is of potential interest for heavy ion collision , where our @xmath131 half cycle corresponds to heating for which the dynamics of the experiment is definitely fast .",
    "we have no entirely satisfactory theoretical explanation for the observed asymmetry , but think that is is related to the fact that @xmath13-ality order - order domain may emerge in the ordered ( deconfined ) phase .",
    "using quenching , we find dynamical signals surviving even after the proper ( second order ) phase transition is converted into a crossover .",
    "moving then far away from the transition , the dynamical signals fade away too and the issue of crossovers requires further investigations .",
    "our computer programs allow to extend the present study to the 3-state potts model in three dimensions with an external magnetic field representing quark effects . in a more remote future",
    ", one could carry out similar studies for quenched and even full qcd .",
    "but none of these studies could resolve the problem of a quantitative relationship between the glauber time scale of our euclidean dynamics and the time scale of the minkowskian dynamics in the real world . in this context",
    "it is of interest that pisarski and dumitru developed recently a polyakov loop model  @xcite which allows for simulations in the minkowskian formulation  @xcite",
    ". it may be possible to address questions similar to those raised in our paper within the hyperbolic dynamics of their model .",
    "most likely the aim of such studies can not be to make precise quantitative predictions .",
    "instead , one may have to be content with illustrating the effect of different speeds of the phase conversion on the observable signals qualitatively .",
    "if spinodal decomposition of polyakov loops is indeed realized in heavy ion collisions , one may observe an enhancement in the production of low - energy gluons .",
