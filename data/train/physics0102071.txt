    "in the neighborhood of the critical point of the liquid  vapor transition the density can be varied in a large interval with a reasonably small change of pressure and therefore it is relatively easy to investigate how the nature of the electronic states evolve starting from the dilute gas regime , where the kinetic theory is appropriate , towards the liquid regime .",
    "the central quantity of interest is the electron mobility @xmath9 it is defined as the ratio of the mean velocity @xmath10 acquired by an electron drifting in the medium under the action of an externally applied and uniform electric field , and the strength of the field @xmath11 its zero  field limit , @xmath12 is related to the fundamental properties of the @xmath13atom interaction . in the low density regime , the kinetic theory relates @xmath14 to the electron ",

    "( [ eq : mu0kin ] ) predicts that @xmath8 depends only on the gas temperature and is independent of the gas density .",
    "in contrast with the prediction of the classical kinetic theory @xcite , the electron mobility shows a strong dependence on the density of the medium @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to study the effect of the environment on the electron",
    " atom scattering mechanisms in a relatively dense phase .",
    "large deviations from the classical prediction , called _ anomalous density effects _ , have been observed even in the simplest systems represented by the noble gases @xcite . in gases ,",
    "such as he @xcite and ne @xcite , where the short  range repulsive exchange forces dominate the electron ",
    "atom interaction , there is a _ negative density effect _ ,",
    "namely , @xmath8 decreases with increasing @xmath3 and eventually drops rapidly to very low values because of the formation of localized electron states at high enough densities and in the liquid @xcite .",
    "the situation in ar is different . here , the @xmath13atom scattering at low energies is essentially determined by the long  range attractive polarization interaction because the atomic polarizability of ar is quite large . owing to this feature , @xmath8 shows a _ positive density effect _ ,",
    "i.e. , it increases with increasing @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a further relevant feature of ar and of the heavier noble gases is that in the liquid the electron mobility has a value comparable to that in the crystalline state @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that this characteristics of the mobility is due to the existence , also in the liquid , of a conduction band .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate , as a function of the density of the medium , the transition from the classical single scattering situation in the dilute gas to the multiple scattering scenario at higher densities and the eventual formation of extended ( or localized ) electron states in the liquid .",
    "the explanation of the different _ density effects _ in the mobility is commonly based on the realization that the average interatomic distance at high densities becomes comparable to the electron de broglie wavelength @xmath21 in this situation , the conditions for single scattering break down and quantum effects become important . moreover , also the mean free path @xmath22 becomes comparable to @xmath23 and multiple scattering effects come into play , too @xcite",

    "has been developed that incorporates all features of the several models proposed to interpret the different density effects and merges the several multiple scattering effects into the single scattering picture of kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "three main multiple scattering effects have been identified and all of them stem from the fact that the electron mean free path becomes comparable to its wavelength and that the latter may also become larger than the average interatomic distance if the density is large enough . the first effect is a density  dependent quantum shift @xmath24 of the ground state energy of an excess electron immersed in the medium . according to the sjc model",

    "differently stated , the bottom of the electron energy distribution function is shifted by the amount @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the second multiple scattering effect is an enhancement of electron backscattering due to quantum self  interference of the electron wave function scattered off atoms located along paths which are connected by time  reversal simmetry @xcite .",

    "therefore , the experimental points converge to the prediction of the classical kinetic theory .",

    "the observed behavior can be explained by noting that , for @xmath107 the average electron energy equals that of the ramsauer minimum of the cross section , @xmath112 generally speaking , it turns out that @xmath104 can be written in the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a monotonically increasing function of the reduced electric field @xcite . since the density  dependent electron kinetic energy shift @xmath28 increases with increasing @xmath95 @xmath98 must decrease in order to fulfill the condition @xmath115 with increasing @xmath3 at constant temperature .",
    "[ we will furthermore show that the change of slope of @xmath98 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath116 is related to the change of slope of @xmath28 at the same density .",
    "] eventually , for @xmath117 the electron energy distribution function is so largely shifted by @xmath29 as to sample the scattering cross section well beyond the ramsauer ",
    "townsend minimum .",
    "this is the reason of the disappearing of the mobility maximum .    a cornerstone for the understanding of the electron scattering in dense gases is represented by the analysis of behavior of the zero  field density  normalized mobility @xmath8     as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath86 ( open squares ) , @xmath92 ( open circles ) @xcite , and @xmath118 k ( closed circles ) .",

    "5 we therefore show the zero  field density  normalized mobility @xmath8 as a function of @xmath3 for the two investigated temperatures @xmath86 k and @xmath71 k. previous data taken at @xmath92 k with a different apparatus @xcite are reported in order to show the consistency of the present data . moreover , also data obtained in liquid ar @xcite are shown for comparison , although it must be remembered that the measurements in the liquid are taken along the liquid - vapor coexistence line and are therefore not isothermal .",
    "two relevant features emerge from fig .",
    "the first one is the impressive increase of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath3 for both temperatures up to @xmath120 this behavior is present also at room temperatures @xcite and has been one the primary motivations for the development of multiple scattering theories .",
    "the bsl model explains quantitatively this feature of @xmath121 for @xmath122 for @xmath123 electrons are in thermal equilibrium with the host gas and do not gain energy from the field .",
    "therefore , their average energy is @xmath124 in this energy range , the momentum ",
    "transfer cross section decreases rapidly with increasing electron energy @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "6 .        roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath8 is a sort of weighted average of the inverse cross section , as it can be realized by inspecting eq .",
    "[ eq : mu0kin ] . to a first approximation , @xmath125 at constant @xmath126",
    "this average should be constant and should not depend on the density @xmath95 unless @xmath127 depends on it .",
    "in particular , owing to the shape of @xmath128 @xmath8 can increase with increasing @xmath3 only if @xmath104 does the same .",
    "therefore , the positive density effect of @xmath8 supports the conclusion that the average electron kinetic energy includes a density  dependent contribution that is positive and increases with increasing @xmath95 as expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq : eave ] .",
    "this conclusion immediately rationalizes the observations described by christophorou _",
    "in fact , they note that the minimum of the inverse density ",
    "normalized mobility at zero  field , i.e. a quantity proportional to the cross section , shifts to lower energies as the density is increased .",
    "they calculate the average electron energy at zero field according to the nernst ",
    "townsend relation @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the longitudinal diffusion coefficient . by so doing , they neglect the density  dependent zero  point electron energy @xmath131 and therefore the ramsauer  townsend",
    "minimum seemingly appears at lower energies , as can be seen by inspecting eq .",
    "[ eq : eave ] with @xmath132 and by neglecting @xmath34    the second most relevant feature is the presence of a sharp maximum of @xmath8 for @xmath133 at @xmath71 k. [ probably , such maximum would exist also at the higher temperature , but the limited pressure range of the experimental cell @xmath134 did not allow the investigation of larger densities at higher temperatures . ]",
    "the @xmath8 maximum occurs at nearly the same density where it was observed in liquid ar @xcite , as also shown in fig .",
    "a similar behavior has been previously observed in liquid and gaseous ch@xmath135 @xcite .",
    "it is well  known @xcite that the maximum of @xmath8 in liquid has been attributed to scattering of electrons off long - wavelength collective modes of the fluid .",
    "the intrinsic density fluctuations of the liquid modulate the electron energy at the bottom of the conduction band of the liquid , @xmath25 and the spatial fluctuations of @xmath24 act as the potential for the scattering , just as lattice deformation ",
    "potentials from acoustic phonons scatter carriers in semiconductors . within the _ deformation potential _",
    "theory , the potential for scattering is linear in the density deviations about the average value . since it happens that @xmath24 has a minimum at nearly the same density , @xmath136 where @xmath8 is maximum @xcite , the scattering potential vanishes to first order at @xmath137 therefore , at this density the scattering of electrons is very much reduced and the electron mobility turns out to be maximal . for any other @xmath138 the slope of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath3 is nonzero and deformation potential is large enough to efficiently scatter electrons , thus reducing their mobility .",
    "however , a gas does not support phonons as a liquid does .",
    "therefore , the presence of the @xmath8 maximum in dense ar gas at the same density @xmath119 as in the liquid raises the question if , beyond a given density threshold , there is a change in the physical mechanisms which determine the mobility in the gas , or , rather , if the single scattering picture of the density  modified kinetic theory can be extended to the liquid .",
    "on one hand , one could argue that , at low and medium densities , the single scatterer approximation is valid and electrons can be described as scattering off individual atoms , though the scattering properties have to be density  modified in order to account for multiple scattering effects . on increasing the density , a conduction band might develop and electrons might be scattered off long  wavelength collective modes of the dense gas , though they might not be true phonons .",
    "on the other hand , there are several reasons to extend the single scattering picture to the liquid .",
    "first of all , the phononic theories are developed for thermal electrons only , i.e. , they make predictions only on @xmath8 and completely disregard the electric field dependence of the experimental @xmath70 data .",
    "this dependence is very important because it is intimately related to the shape of the atomic cross section .",
    "there have indeed been more or less successful attempts to use the classical kinetic theory even in the liquid @xcite , though the cross section has been taken as an adjustable parameter .",
    "moreover , the _ phononic _ models do not even predict accurately @xmath139 unless higher ",
    "order scattering processes are taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is therefore challenging to investigate the possibility that the density  modified kinetic model can account for the @xmath8 maximum and that a single  scattering picture can be retained even in the liquid , owing to its conceptual simplicity .",
    "the bsl model has been thus used for the analysis of the experimental data at high density .",
    "first of all , we do not make any assumptions on the value of the kinetic energy shift @xmath140 we treat it as an adjustable parameter to be determined by fitting the equations of the model eqns .",
    "[ eq : munmkm][eq : smtstar ] in the limit @xmath141 to the experimental data .",
    "literature data for the cross section have been used @xcite .",

    "the data at @xmath143 k agree very well with the data taken at @xmath59 k. there are small differences between the results for @xmath71 k and @xmath86 k , which might be attributed to the larger gas compressibility for the temperature close to @xmath144 and to the uncertainty with which the _ short  range correlation length _",

    "therefore , it has no influence on the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath88 at constant density . while @xmath160 is introduced as an adjustable parameter , the energy shift @xmath29 is no longer determined from the experimental data . instead of @xmath29",
    "it is rather used the value @xmath161 given by the ws model and calculated according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ews ] ( solid line in fig . 7 ) .     as a function of @xmath3 ( lower scale ) and energy ( upper scale ) .",
    "the upper scale has been obtained by converting density to energy by means of the ws model . ]",
    "@xmath158 is everywhere replaced by @xmath162 and @xmath160 is so adjusted as to reproduce the behavior of @xmath163 as a function of @xmath30 @xmath160 turns out to be of order unity @xmath164 with this choice the electric field dependence of @xmath70 is reproduced even at the highest densities .",
    "the shape of the effective cross section at thermal energies @xmath165 $ ] is shown in fig .",
    "the energy scale on the upper horizontal axis has been obtained by converting density to energy by means of the ws model eq .",
    "[ eq : ews ] . by comparing fig . 9 to fig .",
    "6 there is undoubtely a strong similarity between @xmath166 and the atomic cross section @xmath167 in particular , it is interesting the presence of a ramsauer  type minimum also in the effective cross section .",
    "moreover , the strength of @xmath166 is very close to its atomic companion , though the position of the minimum occurs at a somewhat lower energy and the minimum itself appears to be narrower .",
    "this feature might be due to the use of the ws model for the @xmath168 conversion .",
    "if the experimentally determined values of @xmath28 had been used instead of the ws model , the @xmath166 minimum would be broader and shifted to larger energies because @xmath169 for @xmath170    this effective cross section can be compared with the effective one @xmath171 obtained in liquid ar by christophourou _",
    "even there , @xmath171 appears to be much narrower and its minimum occurs at an energy much smaller than in the atomic one .",
    "an agreement with the two effective cross sections could be obtained by adding @xmath28 to and by using @xmath172 rather than @xmath52 in the data of christophorou .",
    "in this paper measurements of the excess electron mobility in dense ar gas in the neighborhood of the liquid  vapor critical point are presented .",
    "the most important result of the present experiment is the observation of a sharp maximum of the zero  field density  normalized mobility @xmath8 at the same density where it occurs in the liquid .",
    "the interpretation of these measurements is challenging because two opposite points of views must be reconciled .",
    "in fact , in the low  density gas it is customary to adopt a single scattering picture , while in the dense liquid the electron transport properties are described in terms of scattering of electrons off collective excitations of the medium .",
    "the interesting point is to understand if the physical mechanisms underlying the scattering processes gradually change at some density between the dilute gas and the dense liquid or if the kinetic picture valid at low density can be still retained , with obvious modifications so as to include multiple scattering , also in the liquid phase .    to this goal ,",
    "the present data have been analyzed by extending the heuristic model proposed by borghesani _",
    "_ to explain the mobility measurements in moderately dense ar gas @xcite .",
    "the model is a density  modified kinetic model based on the classical kinetic theory @xcite , where density  dependent multiple  scattering effects are included in a heuristic way .",
    "the model is based on the quantum density - dependent shift of the ground state energy of the electrons in a dense and disordered medium , on the accounting for correlations among scatterers described by the static structure factor of the medium , and on the quantum self  interference of the electron wavepacket scattered off randomly located scattering centers along paths connected by time  reversal .",
    "the kinetic term of the ground state energy shift must be added to the usual kinetic energy of the electrons when the cross section and other dynamic properties of scattering have to be evaluated .",
    "all these effects concur to dress the atomic cross section resulting in an effective density  dependent momentum transfer cross section , that nonetheless is intimately related to the atomic one .",
    "although the data for quite high densities fit well in this model , the description of the newly discovered feature , namely the mobility maximum , requires the introduction of a density  dependent adjustable parameter that scales the cross section . in any case , however , the kinetic picture is preserved and the resulting effective cross section turns out to be very similar to the atomic one . in particular , it shows a ramsauer  type minimum .",
    "the overall success of this kinetic description is striking , even more if one takes into account the limited accuracy with which the atomic cross section is known , especially in the region of the ramsauer minimum , and the uncertainty with which the energy  dependent structure function @xmath173 is known , particularly in the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "it also appears that more refined theoretical calculations of the kinetic energy shift at high density are needed , as well as a treatment of the effect of the density fluctuations on the electron energy distribution function .",
    "moreover , these data still raise the question of how to treat theoretically the scattering processes for momentum transfer at very large densities , possibly including contributions from mechanisms different from density  modified kinetic processes .",
