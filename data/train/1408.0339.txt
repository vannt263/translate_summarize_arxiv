    "recently omnipresence of wireless devices prompted the researchers and engineers to delve into the security issues of wireless communication .",
    "as compared to wired medium , ensuring security for wireless medium is more challenging mainly due to the broadcast nature of the transmission .",
    "but the ongoing research on _ physical layer security _    promises robust and reliable security schemes for wireless communication .",
    "contrary to conventional cryptographic schemes physical layer security techniques are impregnable as the security is ensured by inherent randomness present in the wireless medium .",
    "physical layer security came to existence through the seminal work of wyner @xcite , where he explored the possibility of secure communication without relying on private keys . later leung and hellman @xcite extended this idea to gaussian channels .",
    "following their works , in last decade several researchers have devised techniques    for secure communication in    single - hop single and multi - antenna systems .",
    "recently a considerable amount of research is ongoing to extend those schemes to multi - hop network scenarios .",
    "in fact , several works have demonstrated that _ cooperative relaying _",
    "@xcite can    significantly improve the performance of secure communication .",
    "one such cooperative scheme is beamforming , where multiple transmitters adjust their gain and phase to improve the signal strength at the destination . though beamforming was initially developed for multi - antenna systems , but due to energy and hardware constraints distributed beamforming solution using multiple single antenna node is proposed @xcite . in those papers",
    "authors have assumed that relay nodes are trustworthy and they beamform towards the destination to defeat ( an ) external eavesdropper(s ) .",
    "but due to the unprotected nature of public ad hoc network ( _ e.g. _ sensor network ) , an adversary can wiretap those relay nodes to obtain the information transmitted by source .",
    "this prompted us to look for a solution of one of the worst adversarial scenarios of secure communication , where one have to maintain the secrecy of data from the participating relay nodes .",
    "secure transmission using untrusted relay nodes has appeared before in @xcite , where secure communication    is obtained by simultaneously transmitting two or more signals . but multiple simultaneous transmission in the above mentioned papers were possible due to mutiple sources and/or multiple jammers . in absence of mutiple sources or jammers",
    "source has to rely on artificial noise @xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite considered artificial noise based beamforming solution for af relay network , but unlike them we have untrusted relay nodes and artificial noise is introduced by the source itself .    in our work we have considered multiple amplify - and - forward ( af ) untrusted relay nodes , who help the source to deliver the message at destination , but at the same time can eavesdrop the ongoing transmission . to prevent eavesdropping the source adds artificial noise in the message and broadcast it in first phase . in second phase source and relay nodes beamform to deliver the signal at the destination .",
    "though _ secrecy rate _ is the conventional metric to evaluate the performance of such system , but for our model in certain scenarios maximizing secrecy rate results in removal of artificial noise .",
    "therefore , we consider a pragmatic approach based on snr criteria , where we intend keep the snr at the untrusted relay nodes below certain predefined threshold . assuming perfect channel state information ( csi ) , we evaluate the optimal scaling factor for all the transmitting nodes which not only nullifies the artificial noise but also maximizes the snr at the destination .",
    "we consider both the total and individual power constraints scenario for all transmitting nodes and provide analytical approach for optimal solutions .",
    "we consider a two - hop network shown in figure [ fig : model ] containing multiple relay nodes ( @xmath0 ) aiding the transmission from source node @xmath1 to destination @xmath2 .",
    "adversary is using the relay nodes to passively eavesdrop the on going transmission .",
    "to prevent such eavesdropping source transmits artificial noise along with the actual signal to confuse the adversary . in next phase source along with the relay nodes performs beamforming to deliver the message to the destination .",
    "we are interested in maximizing the information rate which can be transmitted from the source to the destination securely .    in first phase source",
    "transmits a linear combination of two messages @xmath3 using power @xmath4 , where @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 is the gaussian distributed message with zero mean and unit variance and @xmath7 is statistically independent gaussian distributed artificial noise with identical distribution as @xmath6 .",
    "the message received at relay and the destination can be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are complex gaussian noise distributed according to @xmath10 . in second phase relay nodes along with",
    "the source performs beamforming at destination to nullify the artificial noise .",

    "therefore , if we order the source to relay channel gains according to their absolute values , then the one with the highest value will have maximum snr .",

    "@xmath47 is an increasing function of @xmath51 in @xmath52 $ ] if @xmath53 assuming @xmath54 .",
    "but if we use @xmath55 , then in absence of artificial noise , relay nodes can properly decode the message .",
    "so , we consider an snr based approach , where an snr upto @xmath56 results in significant amount of ber in eavesdropping relay nodes and therefore , for all practical purposes we can assume that the message is undecodable at relay nodes .",
    "the optimization problem can be rewritten as :    [ opt2 ] @xmath57",
    "from the optimization problem one can easily see that to maximize @xmath58 , @xmath59 should be equal to @xmath56 . therefore , we can calculate the corresponding @xmath51 and also using the constraint we can bound the @xmath56 value .",
    "@xmath60      once @xmath51 is fixed the first term in the destination snr is constant , therefore , optimization problem can be reduced to :    [ optaftot ] @xmath61    one can check that the constraint will be satisfied with equality at optima and the objective function can be written as : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath69 therefore , if we denote @xmath70^{\\mathbf{t}}$ ] and @xmath71^{\\mathbf{t}}$ ] , then the optimization problem can be essentially written as :    [ opt5 ] @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 is a @xmath77 identity matrix , and @xmath78\\trnp$ ] .",
    "[ prpn1 ] the optimal solution for problem with only source constraint i.e. is given by : @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81    we denote the vector @xmath82 $ ] as @xmath83 , then the objective function can be rewritten as : @xmath84    now it is easy to see that , if @xmath85 , then maximum value of @xmath86 . as the objective function is an increasing function of @xmath87 ,",
    "so in absence of individual constraints _ i.e. _ , the source constraint will be satisfied with equality . from",

    "if the solution obtained in the above manner satisfy all the individual constraints , then we have indeed solved the problem .",
    "but , if for any @xmath91 individual constraint is violated , then we solve the problem using the following iterative approach .    1 .   initialize parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "for individual power constraints we considered @xmath122 and @xmath123 , whereas , for total power constraint we used @xmath124 .",
    "as the snr value at the destination is an increasing function of @xmath4 and @xmath51 , so the channel capacity increases as we increase both the parameters .     with respect to @xmath4 for several @xmath51 values in case of both total and individual constraints . ]    in figure [ fig : cdvsm ] we plot the capacity for both total and individual constraint scenario with respect to number of the relay nodes .",
