    "in this section we motivate the study of what we call random operator - valued matrices . in particular , we generalize a random matrix model used in wireless communications . this will also provide us a natural link between random matrix ensembles and random operator - valued matrices . in the following section we summarize the notation and setting of this paper .",
    "recent developments in operator - valued free probability theory @xcite have made possible to analyze a variety of wireless communication systems @xcite . in the developing area of massive multiantenna systems @xcite the dimension of the random matrix modelling the system is in the order hundreds or thousands .",
    "these large sizes suggest that the behavior of the spectrum of these matrices is very close to their asymptotic models , e.g. free deterministic equivalents @xcite and operator - valued equivalents @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , random operator - valued matrices ( models ) is a special class of random variables with values over the matrices with coefficients in some non - commutative algebra .",
    "this contrasts with the classical models studied before , e.g. @xcite , where the asymptotic models are non - random operator - valued matrices over some non - commutative algebra . from an applied point of view",
    ", this extra randomness may reflect the statistical variations of the channel in a scale of time bigger than a period of use .",
    "therefore this kind of model may be relevant to study properties of channels that depend on statistics that change over large periods of time .",
    "random operator - valued matrices are also a natural object from a mathematical point of view .",
    "it is known that if operator - valued matrices , i.e. elements in @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a non - commutative probability space , have entries free over @xmath7 then they are free over @xmath8 .",
    "thus , if we have two fixed families @xmath9 and @xmath10 free over @xmath7 and we construct operator - valued matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 for some suitable functions @xmath13 , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be free over @xmath8 . if instead of a pair of functions we have a pair of families of functions @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 for some probability space @xmath18 , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 are random variables with values over operator - valued matrices , thus the name random operator - valued matrices .",
    "of course some measurability conditions should be satisfied , but in the context of this paper this requirement will be clearly satisfied .",
    "if the families @xmath16 and @xmath17 are suitable then the freeness is preserved almost everywhere , which makes possible to work in the realm of operator - value free probability theory almost everywhere .",
    "this is similar to classical probability where we work in the realm of real analysis almost everywhere . in this sense , here we are dealing with a probabilistic version of operator - value free probability theory .",
    "we will not work at this too general level of abstraction , in what follows we construct a particular class of objects for which the pointwise operator - valued behavior is more structured .",
    "returning to the wireless communication context , the random matrix of interest @xmath21 have the following form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a selfadjoint @xmath24 random matrix and @xmath25 is a family of independent @xmath26 standard complex gaussian matrices such that @xmath27 for all @xmath28",

    "by convergence in distribution we mean that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the normalized trace in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "up to this point we described the behavior of @xmath56 for a fixed @xmath43 .",

    "it is important to remark that the random operator - valued matrix of the form @xmath100 as described above can be thought as the mixture by @xmath31 of the operator - valued semicircular element ( over @xmath8 ) @xmath77 . due to the important role of the classical gaussian mixture in several applications",
