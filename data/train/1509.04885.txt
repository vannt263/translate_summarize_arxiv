    "processes with leptons or photons in association with hadronic jets in the final state play an important role in the physics program of the lhc . they constitute in particular a typical signature of the production of top pairs and higgs bosons .",
    "moreover , an accumulation of these processes in certain extreme regions of phase space would be an indication of new bsm physics .",
    "important backgrounds in the selection of higgs and bsm processes are the associated production of gauge bosons or top quarks with jets ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "typically , the multiplicity and kinematics of jets in these events are exploited to achieve a separation from the signal , which makes the precise modelling of these quantities a high priority .    and",
    "processes also constitute powerful tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , with the mass of the bosons or the top quark providing a well - defined scale .",
    "photons and leptonic decay products of massive bosons or top quarks allow to trigger the event independently of the jet kinematics . on the theoretical side",
    ", the large progress in automated calculation of loop amplitudes  @xcite allows for next - to - leading order ( nlo ) predictions with respect to a fixed order of up to five additional partons .",
    "a second path pursues the combination of tree level matrix elements  @xcite or even nlo matrix elements  @xcite of different parton multiplicities matched to a parton shower ( , ) .",
    "since the dominant graphs in basic processes contain at least one gluon in the initial state , differential or double - differential measurements of angles and momenta or masses can be used to constrain the gluon parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the signal selections start with a standard selection of inclusive @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or  final states , extended by additional requirements on the presence of jets .",
    "measured yields are typically unfolded to the particle level using regularized or iterative methods  @xcite and compared with fixed - order calculations and generator predictions .",
    "the latter are corrected by global k - factors to the most precise available calculation for the inclusive process .",
    "jets are reconstructed with the anti-@xmath7  algorithm  @xcite , with a distance parameter of @xmath8 in atlas and @xmath9 in cms .",
    "cross sections are typically measured in clean final states with electrons and muons .",
    "although the cross section for leptonically decaying @xmath4 bosons is larger than for @xmath5 bosons by an order of magnitude , measurements are published for both processes . not only is it of interest to probe the impact of the small mass difference between the bosons but in particular both processes complement each other in terms of uncertainties : the  selection profits from the larger cross sections , whereas the  final state can be selected with a higher purity .    before the start of the lhc",

    "the data was also compared with early releases of  generators .",
    "in contrast ,  production in  collisions is dominated by the compton process .",
    "the larger center - of - mass energies by the lhc enhance the qcd radiation considerably and allow to explore large jet multiplicities and large momentum ranges relevant for higgs and bsm physics . atlas and cms experiments complement each other , both in the selection of observables and of the theory predictions .",

    ", novel nlo techniques  @xcite resulted in a series of new fixed - order predictions for the production of massive gauge bosons with up to five jets  @xcite .",
    "the lhc experiments have used the data collected in 2011 at @xmath0 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath12 in order to probe these new predictions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the performance of lo and nlo   generators was studied .",
    "the results confirm the validity of the fixed - order nlo predictions for vector bosons produced in association with up to five jets performed with the new techniques . in general ,   generators show a reasonable performance in modelling inclusive and differential jet cross sections .",
