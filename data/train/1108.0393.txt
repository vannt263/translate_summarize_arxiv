    "given the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics , the matter content we observe in the universe today is quite preposterous : the universe should simply be filled with relic photons and neutrinos . the existence of a net baryon number , and thus of `` ordinary '' matter , and the existence and dominance of non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the matter density budget manifestly point to physics beyond the standard model , and pose severe model building challenges . with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and with a diverse and far - ranging campaign to search for the particle(s ) composing the dark matter , rapid progress in our understanding of these issues",

    "[ sec : asymmetry ] , electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) is a compelling scenario in which the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) is produced at the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) via particle scattering off of the expanding walls of bubbles of broken ew phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in its supersymmetric incarnation within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , ewb naturally posits a dark matter candidate  the lightest neutralino  across wide portions of its parameter space .",
    "from a phenomenological standpoint , since ewb relies on selected particle species being in thermal equilibrium at the time of the ewpt , the mass scale of these particles must necessarily lie not far from the ew scale itself . as a result ,",
    "any generic successful ewb model , and specifically supersymmetric scenarios , features relatively light , sub - tev particles that would be copiously produced at the lhc , with the lightest neutralino typically quite light and with a sizable higgsino fraction @xcite .",
    "the latter particle properties typically imply very large dark matter direct and indirect detection rates , although this depends on the specifics of the mssm parameter space points .",
    "the particle spectrum of successful and phenomenologically viable mssm ewb models is relatively simple .",
    "first , sfermions , with the possible exception of the right - handed stop , must be extremely heavy , compared to the electroweak scale , in order to avoid excessively large electric dipole moments .",
    "second , for the class of cp - violating sources we consider here , charginos and neutralinos must have electroweak - scale masses , and the higgsino mass term @xmath0 must be close to one of the electroweak gaugino masses @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( resonant neutralino or chargino - driven ew baryogenesis ) .",
    "the collider and dark matter phenomenology of a given ewb model then depends strongly on the relative hierarchy between the hypercharge and the @xmath3 gaugino soft supersymmetry breaking masses . for the sake of illustration",
    ", we employ here two paradigmatic choices  one motivated by gaugino mass unification at the grand unification scale with @xmath4 at the electroweak scale , and one motivated by anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking with @xmath5 .",
    "searches for particle dark matter have seen significant and rapid progress , warranting close scrutiny of their impact on models residing in the regions of parameter space being explored , such as supersymmetric resonant chargino- or neutralino - driven ewb .",
    "the potential of dm searches to constrain the ewb parameter space has been discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , however given recent developments we are now in a position to make more definitive statements about which parts of these regions are still an option for ewb and which are experimentally disfavored or ruled out .",
    "at the same time , as the first lhc results on searches for supersymmetry with 1 fb@xmath6 of integrated luminosity are being presented , outlining prospects for the discovery of this class of models with the lhc seems also particularly timely and compelling .",

    "these sphaleron processes are in equilibrium in the unbroken phase but boltzmann - suppressed in the broken phase , causing the baryon asymmetry to be frozen in once it passes into the broken phase , given a sufficiently strongly first - order phase transition . the left - handed density @xmath8 is created as a result of the scattering of particles off of the spacetime - dependent higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the wall , leading to quantum transport equations ( qtes ) for the relevant species involved .",
    "these processes have been studied in depth in several different contexts ( see e.g. refs .",

    "the conditions for supergauge equilibrium are generally satisfied in the mssm region of interest @xcite , although for other non - minmal susy models one may have to solve the full set of boltzmann equations to accurately compute the baryon asymmetry .",
    "we leave such an investigation to future work .    given the assumptions above , the relevant cp - violating phases in calculating @xmath11 are those arising in the higgsino - gaugino sector from the corresponding soft - breaking terms in the lagrangian .",

    "this suppression may be alleviated by including additional non - resonant source terms in our analysis @xcite , however such contributions typically require larger values of @xmath36 to produce results consistent with the observed bau and scale as @xmath55 for large values ; we do not consider such sources here .",
    "note that for large @xmath18 one may be forced to consider larger values for @xmath52 to satisfy experimental bounds on the @xmath56 decay mode @xcite .",
    "the baryon asymmetry also depends on several parameters associated with the electroweak phase transition , namely the bubble wall velocity , @xmath57 , the wall width , @xmath58 , and the variation of the ratio of higgs vevs across the bubble wall , @xmath59 .",
    "an accurate determination of these quantities for a given choice of mssm parameters requires solving for the exact higgs profile in the bubble wall .",
    "we instead aim to understand how uncertainties associated with the bubble wall parameters affect our results for the baryon asymmetry . in this section",

    "the largest corrections to the lowest order solution @xmath79 are typically those arising from the shift in the effective source term @xcite , which can be written in terms of integrals over @xmath79 in the bubble wall .",
    "these contributions depend on the wall velocity only through the combinations @xmath80 , which , in parametric regions where the corrections are large , depend only weakly on @xmath57 .",
    "this is because when the corrections @xmath81 become large , @xmath82 tends to dominate over @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kap ] ) .",

    "we have verified this approximate expression against the velocity dependence of the full numerical solution for various regions of the parameter space , both on and off resonance , and find the two to be in good agreement .",
    "the profile eq.([eq : approx ] ) reproduces well - known features of the velocity dependence of @xmath60 , namely that small velocities correspond to a quasi - equilibrium situation , thereby suppressing the baryon asymmetry , while large velocities render the transport of the chiral current in front of the bubble wall inefficient , also suppressing the asymmetry , leading to a peak in @xmath60 for @xmath57 around a few @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the bubble wall velocity in the mssm is generally difficult , as the dynamics of the wall are further complicated by friction terms arising from the interactions of the wall with the plasma .",
    "detailed calculations of @xmath57 in the mssm , including various frictional contributions , have been carried out @xcite , suggesting a wall velocity in the range @xmath91 . to quantify the impact of this uncertainty on our results , we solve the qtes numerically for wall velocities that maximize ( minimize ) the lowest order analytic approximation for @xmath60 , eq .",

    "as the neutralinos and charginos in the resonant ewb scenario under consideration are relatively light , with masses typically in the 100 gev-1 tev range , one might hope to observe their production from collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "all other sparticles in this picture possess masses in the multi - tev range and are thus not expected to be produced in significant numbers at the lhc . the possible exception is the gluino , which would be naturally expected to have a mass scale comparable to that of the other two gauginos ( the wino and bino ) .",
    "the gluino mass is , however , entirely unrelated to the phenomenology of ewb , and is thus essentially a free parameter , making it difficult to ascertain sensible predictions for the lhc based upon gluino production .",

[ fig : lhc_tb40 ] ) . slightly larger values of @xmath0 might be accessible if @xmath5 , but far from exhausting the ewb - compatible parameter space in the wino - resonant funnel , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_amsb ] .    finally , we note that the study in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the 14 tev lhc with 10 fb@xmath132 of integrated luminosity accesses cross sections @xmath133 pb via the clean trilepton channel , with the 7 tev lhc probing only larger cross sections .",
    "thus we see from figs .",
    "6 - 7 that the current 7 tev lhc run at the time of writing has so far probed very little of the relevant parameter space for @xmath134 ( the corresponding region has in fact already been ruled out by lep @xcite ; see e.g. fig . 1 ) and only a small sliver of the parameter space near the bottom and left edges of fig . 7 for the @xmath135 scenario",
    "in this study we have shown that recent results from both direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments significantly constrain the regions of the mssm otherwise viable for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "we have illustrated this for two particular classes of supersymmetry - breaking models , however since our results follow primarily from the relative hierarchy of the neutralinos and charginos and not the precise values of the individual gaugino masses , we consider our conclusions to be quite general for a given gaugino mass hierarchy satisfying either @xmath4 or @xmath136 .",
    "in particular , we have found that :    * ewb scenarios with a wino- ( or higgsino- , higgsino - wino- ) like lsp , occurring when @xmath5 , are essentially ruled out by recent dark matter search null results , unless @xmath122-parity is violated or the lsp is not the primary dm constituent .",
    "this is due to the sensitivity of direct detection experiments and neutrino telescopes to light neutralinos with significant wino - higgsino mixing combined with the sensitivity of dwarf spheroidal galaxy gamma ray observations to the complementary wino- and higgsino - like lsp parameter space . *",
    "although ewb models with a bino - type lsp ( @xmath4 ) are not entirely ruled out , only a small portion of the neutralino - driven ewb parameter space is still viable for small values of @xmath52 and large @xmath137 ; for large @xmath52 and/or small cp - violating phase , chargino - driven ewb with a large wino mass becomes the only possibility .",
    "additionally , with moderate improvements in sensitivity , direct and indirect dm detection results will probe larger portions , and in some cases all , of the @xmath105 funnel and the lower portion of the @xmath138 funnel .",
    "further , if the lsp is the primary dm candidate , enforcing the correct relic density rules out the whole @xmath113 funnel for maximal cp - violating phase . * the lhc will probe only the low - mass portions of the ewb - compatible parameter space for both the @xmath139 and @xmath5 scenarios with 100 fb@xmath6 through events with neutralino and chargino pairs in the final state via the clean trilepton signature .",
    "thus , we expect dm searches to typically provide more stringent constraints on the ewb - compatible regions of the mssm than the lhc through this channel .",
    "we emphasize that the conclusions above follow simply from requiring ewb to account for the observed baryon asymmetry and the lsp to be stable and to compose the dark matter density ; relaxing these two requirements will weaken our conclusions by potentially extending ewb - compatible regions beyond those considered here and by mitigating the impact of the various dark matter searches on the gaugino - higgsino mass planes .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that our results may not necessarily apply to all of the so - called  baryogenesis window \" in the mssm discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the authors considered the case of @xmath52 in the multi - tev range and thus relied on sources not considered in the present study , being subdominant for small to moderate @xmath52 and large @xmath18 .",
    "however , portions of the gaugino - higgsino mass planes with a heavy pseudoscalar @xmath110 boson may still be probed with e.g. neutrino telescopes , whose sensitivity increases for large @xmath52 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tb40_2 ] ) .",
    "also , the choice of a heavy cp - odd higgs is not fundamental to the light stop scenario and when this condition is relaxed , we expect our conclusions to constrain much of the allowed parameter space . in particular , requiring the rh stop to be light implies only a small portion of the gaugino - higgsino mass planes in the lower left hand corner consistent with a neutralino lsp , and this corner of the parameter space is precisely the one most tightly constrained by dm results and expected to be probed by the lhc .",
    "we leave a detailed study of the applicability of our results to the case of a heavy @xmath110 and non - resonant sources to future work .",
    "the present study also implicitly guides the answer to the question : what could one conclude regarding electroweak baryogenesis should a _ positive _ dark matter detection signal arise ?",
    "for example , should the next generation of direct detection experiments detect uncontroversial signals of wimp scattering , we could argue , from fig .",
    "[ fig : tb40_1 ] that successful electroweak baryogenesis would force one into either the tip of the @xmath105 funnel , or into the bulk of the @xmath106 region . in turn , fig .",
    "[ fig : tb40_2 ] would then imply a signal at icecube plus deepcore in the latter case , and no signal in the former and , depending upon the value of @xmath52 , possibly a signal from fermi .",
    "vice - versa , a signal from icecube / deepcore could signal that , if this setup is the correct description of how the baryon asymmetry is generated , one should get a positive detection with ton - sized direct detection experiments    in our determination of the parameter space producing the correct observed baryon asymmetry we have been careful to be conservative , addressing the dependence on the various model uncertainties and choosing optimistic values to maximize the ewb compatible regions . as a result , although many details of the mssm parameter space have yet to be tightly constrained , we expect our conclusions to remain applicable as continued progress is made in this regard .    in conclusion ,",
    "the window for electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm is closing fast . barring the discovery of either the particle constituting the dark matter and/or supersymmetry in the near future , one may be left with only a small portion of the entire mssm parameter space viable simultaneously for ewb and a neutralino lsp dark matter candidate , leading one to rely on different sources or extended models to explain the matter content of the universe we observe today .",

    "<S> we study the impact of recent direct and indirect searches for particle dark matter on supersymmetric models with resonant neutralino- or chargino - driven electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) and heavy sfermions . </S>",
    "<S> we outline regions of successful ewb on the planes defined by gaugino and higgsino mass parameters , and calculate the portions of those planes excluded by dark matter search results , and the regions soon to be probed by current and future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that dark matter searches robustly exclude a wino - like lightest supersymmetric particle in successful ewb regions . </S>",
    "<S> bino - like dark matter is still a possibility , although one that will be probed with a modest improvement in the sensitivity of current direct and indirect detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the total production cross section of chargino and neutralino pairs at the large hadron collider , with a center of mass energy of 7 and 14 tev . </S>"
