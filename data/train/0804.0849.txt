    "in order to understand the dynamics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , a thorough understanding of the physical conditions of the ism gas is required over a large range of physical scales .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of changes in density of the neutral atomic component ( h@xmath0i ) over a wide range of physical scales from tens of au to parsecs plays a major role in determining the evolution of the dense component of the ism . a recent conference in socorro , new mexico ( usa ) in may 2006 was devoted to this broad topic of small scale structures in various ionized and neutral ( atomic and molecular ) phases of the ism ( the sins conference : ` small scale ionized and neutral structures ' ; @xcite ) .",
    "a major topic of discussion at this conference was the nature of h@xmath0i structures with scales from tens to thousands of au .",
    "to date , most of the effort in studying the small scale structure in h@xmath0i has consisted of vlbi and pulsar determinations at the 10 to 100 au scale ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a major gap between the 100-au and 0.1-pc ( @xmath7 au ) scales has remained largely unexplored ; @xcite used the merlin array and the european vlbi network ( evn ) to observed galactic h@xmath0i absorption towards the extragalactic sources 3c  138 ( galactic coordinates @xmath8 = 187.4 and @xmath9 = 11.3 ) and 3c  147 ( galactic coordinates @xmath8 = 161.7 and @xmath9 = 10.3 ) over angular scales of 50 to 1000 milli - arcsec ( mas ) .",
    "prominent changes in h@xmath0i opacity at the level of 0.15 were observed in the merlin 0.1-arcsec resolution data and at the level of 0.5 in the 50-mas evn data .",
    "the changes were observed over linear scales of @xmath10 au arising from nearby h@xmath0i gas ( @xmath11 500 pc ) .",
    "a number of discussions of the observational characteristics of the small scale neutral gas in addition to h@xmath0i were presented at the sins conference @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reviewed the nature of both spatial and temporal variations in optical is lines , while @xcite have reviewed c@xmath0i uv observations suggesting overpressure in some portions of the ism . if the observations of opacity variations are interpreted in terms of density fluctuations , a major problem of excess density and pressure is implied . to overcome this problem @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite ) has suggested several geometrical explanations that would reduce the overpressure ; examples include sheet or filament morphologies .",
    "@xcite ( also see @xcite ) has , on the other hand , proposed that the structures on small scales of tens of au are only a natural extension of irregularities in the distribution of h@xmath0i scales at much larger dimensions , based on a power law ( ` red spectrum ' ) derived by @xcite using vla data in the direction of the galactic source cas  a. this derivation consisted of a power law over scales of several parsec to less than 0.1 pc .",
    "the pros and cons of these contrasting proposals are discussed by @xcite .    in order to fill in the gap between the 0.1-pc and 10-au scales , additional observations of the 100-au scale",
    "are required .",
    "the merlin array at 21 cm is the ideal instrument for this endeavour ; we undertook h@xmath0i absorption observations in the direction of strong extragalactic sources with total angular sizes of order 1 arcsec .",
    "three sources with galactic latitudes in the range 8 to 12 were observed in 2001 and 2003 .",
    "these observations represent the second instalment of galactic h@xmath0i studies following @xcite .",
    "the choice of sources was guided by the pioneering ( and under - recognized ) ground - breaking galactic h@xmath0i absorption studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "observations were made in the early 1980s , using the newly completed vla with an angular resolution of 34 arcsec and a velocity resolution of 1.31.6 km s@xmath2 , in the directions of 3c  111 , 3c  123 , 3c  161 and 3c  348 .",
    "the new merlin observations were made with an angular resolution of @xmath1 arcsec and a velocity resolution of 0.49 km s@xmath2 , in the direction of all of these sources except for 3c  348 .",
    "preliminary merlin results were presented by @xcite .",
    "we outline the data acquisition process in section  [ obs ] and describe and interpret the h@xmath0i absorption towards each source in section  [ results ] .",
    "the results and implications for the structure and kinematics of galactic h@xmath0i are summarised in section  [ concl ] and we add an appendix [ appendix ] on hitherto unpublished data for 3c  161 .",
    "the observations were carried out in a two - stage process .",
    "the structure of our targets had never been investigated previously at 0.1-arcsec resolution ( with the exception of the 3c123 hotspots at 5 ghz , @xcite ) so we started by observing the radio continuum from each source , at a wavelength of either 6 or 21 cm , in order to determine the size of the field required for the final h@xmath0i line and continuum images .",
    "the continuum observations were made using the merlin array including the antennas at defford , cambridge , knockin , darnhall , tabley , and the mk2 telescope at jodrell bank , giving a usable bandwidth of 1315 mhz .",
    "the observing parameters are given in in table  [ obspar ] .",
    "standard observing and data reduction procedures were used , see the merlin user guide @xcite .",
    "the resulting continuum images are in good agreement with the somewhat lower - sensitivity images made during the h@xmath0i observations ( see below ) . the continuum emission from 3c161",
    "is discussed further in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "the observing parameters for the h@xmath0i observations are given in table  [ obspar ] .",
    "the antennas listed above were used with the addition of the lovell telescope .",
    "observations of the spectral targets were interleaved with observations of nearby compact phase reference sources listed in table  [ obspar ] .",
    "we used a 0.5-mhz bandwidth divided into 256 channels for the h@xmath0i targets and the bandpass calibration source , giving a velocity channel separation of 0.41 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the target data were recorded adjusted to a fixed velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( @xmath12 ) , given in table  [ obspar ] .",
    "other calibration sources were observed using the standard wide - band continuum configuration for maximum sensitivity .",
    "the absolute flux density scale for all sources was derived from 3c  286 .",
    "we used 3c  84 to calibrate the bandpass , after eliminating its weak galactic absorption .",
    "we applied these solutions and the phase and amplitude calibrations derived from the phase reference sources to the relevant targets .",
    "more details of merlin spectral line data reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "after calibration , we inspected the spectrum of each target and identified the line - free channels .",
    "these were subtracted from the spectra to enable us to make h@xmath0i absorption line cubes and we also imaged the continuum .",
    "the final optical depth cubes were calculated from the continuum image and the line cube .",
    "we used cutoffs of a few per cent of the peak continuum intensities ( see table  [ obspar ] and captions to the relevant figures ) .",
    "all positions are given in j 2000 ( icrs ) .",
    "we can only measure h@xmath0i absorption on the same scale as the continuum structures , since h@xmath0i emission is undetectable on the ( sub-)arcsec merlin scales .",
    "the maximum scale of emission which can be imaged reliably from our observations is 23 arcsec at 1.4 ghz and 0.71 arcsec at 5 ghz .",
    "detectable emission on slightly larger scales would cause a distinctive bowl artefact due to missing flux density on most baselines .",
    "no signs of this are detected in any of the merlin images , implying that there is minimal missing flux density on the scales from 0.1 to 3 arcsec imaged here .",
    "in addition we compare the current merlin results with existing vla data to confirm the minimal effect of missing short spacings .",
    "detailed comments are presented for each source .",
    "the large low latitude source 3c  111 ( @xmath8 = 16168 , @xmath9 = 882 ) has a complex continuum structure .",
    "this fr ( fanaroff - riley ) ii source is a nearby broad line radio galaxy at a redshift of 0.049 .",
    "vla continuum studies were carried out by @xcite ; @xcite have also summarized vla h@xmath0i observations of this source , identifying a core continuum component ( their ` 2 ' ) and two prominent lobes with hotspots , ne ( their ` 1 ' , displacement 2  arcmin ) and sw ( their ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' , displaced by 80  arcsec ) . using the merlin array ,",
    "the ne component is detected with an extent of @xmath13 arcsec and a continuum peak of only 46 mjy  beam@xmath2 ( not listed in table  [ obspar ] ) ; the mean h@xmath0i spectrum was obtained after smoothing to a 0.3-arcsec resolution .",
    "the core of the galaxy has a peak of 1.27 jy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "the two h@xmath0i spectra for components 1 and 2 are superimposed in fig .",
    "[ 3c111tauspec ] .",
    "the sw component is heavily resolved by merlin ; the emission detected over @xmath4 arcsec has a peak of only 8 mjy beam@xmath2 . at this level , detection of h@xmath0i absorption",
    "is not possible even after some smoothing .",
    "we also note that the highest apparent h@xmath0i opacities for the ne component ( at 5 and 0 km s@xmath2 ) are unreliable with uncertainties in excess of 1 , due to the partial saturation of the h@xmath0i line and the weakness of the resolved continuum feature .",
    "the faintness of the lobes of 3c111 implies that it is impossible to determine detailed h@xmath0i opacity images .",
    "the spectra obtained for the core source and for the average of the ne lobe using merlin are in excellent agreement with earlier vla data obtained with a resolution of 3.5 arc sec obtained by @xcite .",
    "we confirm the increase in the h@xmath0i opacity for the 19 km s@xmath2 feature , from @xmath14 h@xmath0i @xmath15 0.35 towards the core ( component 2 ) , compared with @xmath14 h@xmath0i @xmath11 0.1 towards the ne hotspot ( component 1 ) .",
    "a relatively higher opacity of @xmath14 h@xmath0i @xmath16 is observed towards the ne hotspot at 11 km s@xmath2 , compared with @xmath14 h@xmath0i @xmath17 towards the core .",
    "@xcite made observations towards 3c  111 using the vla at 1614-arcsec resolution at the respective h@xmath0i and oh line frequencies of 1.4 and 1.6 ghz as well as multi - epoch observations of h@xmath18co at 4.8 ghz in various configurations .",
    "their images are also consistent with the h@xmath0i results from @xcite , containing substantial absorption line variations in h@xmath0i and oh which suggest with structure on scales of 0.14 to 0.34 pc at their adopted distance of 350 pc .",
    "the time variability in h@xmath18co absorption observed towards the core by @xcite and @xcite over a 3.4 yr period provides additional evidence for 10-au concentrations with number densities @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "these apparent fluctuations could arise from a combination of the elliptical apparent motion due to parallax , linear solar motion and the proper motion of the cloud @xcite , giving a transverse drift of about 4 au per year ( at the adopted distance of 350 pc ) of the position of the line of sight through each cloud towards the background source .      the continuum image of 3c  123 ( @xmath8 = 17058 , @xmath9 = 1166 ) is shown in fig .",

[ 3c123cont ] ) in an area of about 10",
    "arcsec@xmath25 is in good agreement with the vla image over the same region .",
    "the central core radio source is unresolved by merlin and has a flux density of 48 mjy , compared to 51 mjy in the vla image .    the mean h@xmath0i optical depth spectrum toward the se hotspot ( over an area of 025 @xmath26 025 ) is shown in figure  [ 3c123tauspec ] .",
    "this spectrum is similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "their anomalous velocity feature at 73 km s@xmath2 is outside the velocity range ( @xmath2750 km s@xmath2 ) of the current observations . the narrow line at 20.1 km s@xmath2 ( fwhm @xmath28 km s@xmath2 ) and the + 4.2 km s@xmath2 feature ( fwhm @xmath29 km s@xmath2 ) are prominent ;",
    "the latter has been associated with a co line indicative of a possible association with a molecular cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mean opacity of the 20.1 km s@xmath2 line in the merlin data is somewhat larger than the value reported by @xcite ( their position ` c ' ) ; the properties of the + 4.2 km s@xmath2 feature agree closely . in the absence of a direct measurement , a possible distance @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 = 107 pc is the mean value of the galactic height @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the moderate - velocity h@xmath0i observed towards 3c123 is at @xmath33 pc ( as adopted by @xcite ) , where 0.1  arcsec corresponds to transverse sizes @xmath34 50 au .",

    "the angular scales of the variations vary from 0.2 to 0.6 arcsec ( 100 to 300 au ) . in the n - s slice a variation of @xmath37 in opacity is observed . in the e - w slice a variation in opacity of @xmath38 is observed on a scale of 0.2 arcsec and a variation of @xmath39 over 0.3 arcsec .",
    "figure  [ 3c123taumap21 ] shows a comparable plot of the variation of h@xmath0i opacity at 20.1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the weak absorption is essentially constant over the scale of @xmath40  arcsec ( 1000 au ) at a level of @xmath14(h@xmath0i ) @xmath41 .",
    "this low - latitude heavily reddened field ( @xmath8 = 21544 , @xmath9 = 807 ) remains an empty field with no certain optical identification .",
    "3c  161 is compact ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with observed radio structure on the arcsec scale .",
    "the later authors present a vla image at 5  ghz ( beam 0.4  arcsec ) showing an obvious extension to the west . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that 3c  161 is a css ( compact steep spectrum source ) with a spectral index of @xmath42 .",
    "the source has also been discussed by @xcite . the continuum image made during the vla h@xmath0i observations of @xcite (",
    "beam 4.2  arcsec ) remains a remarkable contribution in providing the overall morphology of the fainter components of the source over a range of @xmath15 1  arcmin ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) .",

    "faison and goss have also observed 3c  161 with the vlba in 1998 ( unpublished ) with a faint detection of emission on an angular scale of tens of mas .",
    "thus 3c  161 contains no prominent milli - arcsec scale structure and is an ideal candidate for merlin 0.1  arcsec h@xmath0i imaging .",
    "3c  161 is the brightest of our three sources ( the continuum flux density exceeds @xmath43 jy beam@xmath2 over almost 1 arcsec@xmath44 ) , giving very good sensitivity to h@xmath0i absorption on scales of 100 mas .",

    "the total continuum flux density detected by merlin in the 10-arcsec@xmath25 region around component ` 1 ' , shown in fig .",
    "[ 3c161cont ] , is 10.5 jy , compared to a peak flux density of 12.1 jy in the newly constructed vla image at ( 5.7 @xmath26 4.2 ) arcsec@xmath25 resolution .",
    "thus , the merlin continuum image contains almost 90 per cent of the flux density as observed at lower resolution over the relevant field of view .",
    "the expectation that the merlin line data represents most of the vla emission / absorption in this region is verified by the comparison of the two integrated h@xmath0i spectra over the extent of the continuum source shown in fig .",
    "[ 3c161cont ] .",
    "the vla and merlin data agree remarkably well , given the uncertainties .",
    "in addition , the merlin spectrum over a much smaller region of ( 0.35 @xmath26 0.35 ) arcsec@xmath25 , shown in fig  [ 3c161tauspec ] , also agrees with the mean vla spectrum as expected .",
    "there remains the possibility that for 3c  161 the opacities at @xmath45 may be somewhat overestimated ( by @xmath46 ) , if there is a slight amount of missing continuum flux density .",
    "the weak extended components of 3c  161 ( see fig  [ 3c161_vla_l.ps ] ) are not detected in the merlin data due to the larger angular sizes and resulting lower surface brightnesses ( giving @xmath47 mjy beam@xmath2 on the scale of the merlin beam ) compared with the bright ne lobe .",
    "there is some evidence in fig .",
    "[ 3c161tauspec ] for a separate line at @xmath48 km s@xmath2 , close to a line detected in the earlier nrao 3-element interferometer data of @xcite    the observed range of velocities from 0 to 35 km s@xmath2 suggests the influence of galactic rotation in the third quadrant of the galaxy with more positive velocities arising from is gas at larger distances from the sun . as an example the velocity of 34.2 km s@xmath2 would have an inferred distance of @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the distances that can be associated with gas at lower velocities ( less than @xmath50 km s@xmath2 , twice the cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersion ) are quite uncertain and a better estimate may well be to use equation  [ eq : z ] with a resultant distance of 0.8 kpc .",
    "( @xcite have discussed the problem of distances of h@xmath0i features in this direction .",
    "they point out that for 3c161 : `` ... the gould belt phenomenon carries the cloud velocities to rotationally permitted values ..

    "the vla did not detect any core emission but the 3@xmath5 noise level of this image is close to the peak emission of the core candidate measured by merlin , so it is feasible that it was just below the detection threshold of these vla data .",
