    "the study on superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials has attracted growing efforts in recent years@xcite . for most superconductors ,",
    "the atomic lattice has a centrosymmetry , therefore the system is inversion symmetric .",
    "the orbital part of the superconducting order parameter has a subgroup which is confined by the general group of the atomic lattice . due to the pauli s exclusion rule and the parity conservation , the cooper pair with orbital even parity should have anti - parallel spin state , namely spin singlet , while those having orbital odd parity should have parallel spin state , i.e. , spin triplet .",
    "if a system lacks the centrosymmetry , the enhanced spin - orbital coupling may promote the formation of pairing with high angular momentum , such as the triplet pairing .",
    "meanwhile the noncentrosymmetric structure allows for the existence of a mixture of singlet and triplet pairing .",
    "theoretical features are anticipated in the noncentrosymmetric system@xcite .",
    "a nodal gap structure has been observed in li@xmath10pt@xmath11b showing the possibility of triplet pairing , while due to weaker spin - orbital coupling@xcite , the nodal gap has not been observed in a material li@xmath10pd@xmath11b with similar structure .",
    "it is thus highly desired to investigate the paring symmetry in more materials with noncentrosymmetric structure .",
    "the newly discovered superconductor mg@xmath12ir@xmath1b@xmath2 ( hereafter abbreviated as mgirb ) ( ref .",
    "9 ) with superconducting transition temperature @xmath13 k is one of the rare materials which have the noncentrosymmetry .",
    "this material has a space group of @xmath14 with large and complex unit cells of about 45 atoms .",
    "to some extent it resembles the system li@xmath10(pt , pd)@xmath11b since they have alkaline metals ( li , mg ) , heavy transition elements ( pd , pt , ir ) and the light element boron .",
    "theoretically it was shown that the major quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) derives from the @xmath15 orbital of the heavy transition elements . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed investigation and analysis on the superconducting properties , such as the energy gap , pairing symmetry , electron - phonon coupling strength , condensation energy , etc .",
    ", in mgirb .",
    "our results suggest that the superconductivity in this system is of bcs type with an @xmath16-wave gap symmetry and a slightly moderate electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "the samples were prepared in two steps starting from pure elements of mg ( 98.5% ) , ir ( 99.95% ) and , b ( 99.999% ) using a standard method of solid state reaction .",
    "appropriate mixtures of these starting materials were pressed into pellets , wrapped in ta foil , and sealed in a quartz tube with an atmosphere of 95% ar/ 5% h@xmath10 .",
    "the materials were then heated at 600 @xmath17c and 900 @xmath17c for 40 min and 80 min , respectively . after cooling down to room temperature ,",
    "the samples were reground and then they were pressed into pellets and sealed in a quartz tube with the same atmosphere as used in the first step .",
    "some of the time they were mixed with another certain amount of mg up to 20% . in this process",
    "the sample was heated up to 900 @xmath17c directly and maintained for 80 min . usually the superconducting transition becomes sharper after the second process , but sometimes the @xmath4 may become slightly lower than the first time .",
    "the synthesizing process here is similar to the previous work reported by the princeton group@xcite but still with some differences .",
    "for example , we used mg powder instead of flakes to make the mixture more homogeneous .",
    "in addition , the pressure in the sealed quartz tube may rise to nearly 4 atm at 900 @xmath17c , which may considerably reduce the volatilization of mg during the synthesis .",
    "this is probably the reason that the sample with the transition temperature as high as @xmath4 = 5.7 k was made without adding extra mg in the second step with the starting ratio in the first step as mg : ir : b=12:19:16 .",
    "the resistivity and the ac susceptibility were measured based on an oxford cryogenic system ( maglab - exa-12 ) .",
    "the specific heat was measured on the quantum design instrument physical property measurement system ( ppms ) with temperature down to 1.8 k and the ppms based dilution refrigerator ( dr ) down to 150 mk .",
    "the temperatures of both systems have been well calibrated showing consistency with an error below 2% in the temperature range from 1.8 k to 10 k.     = 5.7 k. the peaks from the secondary impurity phase are marked by the arrows .",
    "it is clear that the main diffraction peaks are from the phase mgirb .",
    ", width=302 ]     and @xmath18 ) ( bottom ) under different dc magnetic fields .",
    "it is clear that the dc magnetic field makes the transition shift parallel to low temperatures , manifesting a field - induced pair - breaking effect .",
    "the inset in the top panel shows the resistive transition in a wide temperature regime at @xmath19 = 0 t.,width=302 ]    as shown in fig.1 , the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern taken on one sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k shows a single phase with very small amount of impurity which is comparable to that reported previously@xcite .",
    "after the first round of synthesizing , the superconducting transition inspected by the ac susceptibility occurs at about 5 k with a relatively wide transition .",
    "however , after the second step , the transition moves to about 5.7 k with a sharper transition width if we did not add extra mg in the second step .",
    "the ta foil seems unreacted with the materials in both steps of the fabrication if the mg content is below 12 in the stoichiometric formula .    in the top frame of fig .",
    "2 we show the temperature dependence of resistivity under different magnetic fields .",
    "one can see that the transition width determined from resistive measurements ( @xmath20 ) is only about 0.2 k. this is consistent with the rather sharp magnetic transition as revealed by the ac susceptibility data shown in the bottom view of fig .",
    "2 . by applying a magnetic field the transition shifts to lower temperatures quickly with a slope @xmath21 0.63 t / k for the present sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k. using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg relation@xcite @xmath22",
    ", we get the upper critical field @xmath23 = 2.48 t. the value found here is comparable to that reported in the earlier paper@xcite ( @xmath24 5 k ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of the slope @xmath7 correlates strongly with @xmath4 . for a sample with @xmath4 = 3.7 k",

    "shown in fig . 3 are the raw data of the specific heat up to a magnetic field of 1 t. the open symbols represent the data taken with the dr , while all filled symbols show the data taken with the ppms .",
    "both sets of data coincide very well for different fields . with increasing the magnetic field the specific heat jump due to the superconducting transition moves quickly to lower temperatures leaving a background which is consistent with that above @xmath4 at zero field .",
    "this provides a reliable way to extract the normal state specific heat as shown by the thick solid line since the normal state can be described by @xmath27 , where the first and the second term correspond to the normal state electronic and phonon contribution , respectively . from the data it is found that @xmath28 = 5.4 mj/ mol k@xmath29 and @xmath6 = 57.7 mj / mol k@xmath30 . by extrapolating the data in the superconducting state at zero field down to 0 k",
    "one finds , however , a residual value @xmath31 13.8 mj/ mol k@xmath30 indicating a contribution either by a nonsuperconducting fraction in volume of about 24% , or by the dos induced by the impurity scattering for a nodal gap which will be discussed later .",
    "the residual @xmath32 may be induced by the nonsuperconducting region , but it is still difficult to be regarded as due to an impurity phase with completely different structure as mgirb since the xrd data shown in fig . 1 is quite clean .",
    "we thus suggest that the superconductivity depends sensitively on the relative compositions among the three elements and some regions without superconductivity have the chemical composition and even the structure close to the superconducting phase . in any case",
    ", it is safe to conclude that the normal state sommerfeld constant for the present sample is close to or slightly above 43.9 mj / mol k@xmath30 .",

    "the dark solid , red dashed , and dotted green lines in ( b ) are the theoretical curves calculated based on the bcs model ( see text ) with a gap of @xmath16 wave , @xmath15 wave , and @xmath33 wave , respectively .",
    ", width=302 ]    next we can have an estimation on the electron - phonon coupling strength based on @xmath6 .",
    "in mgirb , the electronic conduction is dominated by the 5d band electrons of ir atoms .",
    "the dos at @xmath34 given by the local - density approximation band - structure calculation@xcite is about @xmath35 = 5.51/ev spin . by assuming that there is an electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath36 in the system ,",
    "one has    @xmath37    using the band - structure value of @xmath38 , we have @xmath6 = 25.98 @xmath39(mj / mol k@xmath30 ) . taking the experimental value @xmath6 = 43.9 mj / molk@xmath30",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 0.68 , indicating a slightly moderate electron - phonon coupling .    in the raw data shown in fig .",
    "3 , one can see an upturn of @xmath41 in the very low - temperature region .",
    "this upturn is known as the schottky anomaly , induced by lifting the degeneracy of the states of the paramagnetic spins .",
    "we tried a two level ( s=1/2 ) model to fit the low - temperature data but found a poor fitting together with an extremely large land factor @xmath42 in the zeeman energy @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the bohr magneton , @xmath45 = @xmath46 is the effective magnetic field which evolves into @xmath45 = @xmath47 , the crystal field at zero external field . in mgirb",
    "the most possible paramagnetic centers may be from ir@xmath48 ( s=5/2 ) or ir@xmath49 ( s=2 ) .",
    "the system energy due to zeeman splitting in a magnetic field is@xcite",
    "@xmath50    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 = @xmath53s , @xmath53s+1 , ... , s@xmath531 , s. the specific heat due to the schottky effect is thus @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents the concentration of the paramagnetic centers . for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "the calculated results are very close to each other , therefore we show only the fit with @xmath56 corresponding to ir@xmath48 ( six levels ) .",
    "this method allows us to deal with the data at zero and finite fields simultaneously .",
    "it is known that the schottky term should be zero at @xmath58 = 0 k. in the superconducting state , the total specific heat can be written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 as the contribution of the nonsuperconducting regions , @xmath61 is the electronic part . in the zero temperature limit",
    "only the contribution of the nonsuperconducting part is left . applying a magnetic field",
    "gives rise to a finite value @xmath62 to @xmath63 due to the presence of vortices .",
    "practically , in order to fit the schottky term , we first remove the phonon contribution @xmath64 , then vertically move the experimental data downward with a magnitude @xmath32 = 13.8 mj/ mol k@xmath30 and a field - induced vortex term @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we present the specific heat coefficient @xmath66 measured at the magnetic fields up to 1 t. an upturn due to the schottky effect is visible in the low temperature region for all fields . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we show the data at @xmath19 = 0 t before [ ( red ) filled circles ] and after ( dark open squares ) removing the schottky anomaly calculated based on the model of six levels with @xmath67 = 0.25 t , n = 3.74 mj / mol k and g = 2 .",
    "note that we used the value 43.9 mj/ mol k@xmath30 as the normal state sommerfeld constant @xmath6 .",
    "one can see that the low - temperature part after removing the schottky anomaly is flattened out below about 0.8 k when the field is zero .",
    "furthermore , it can also be justified by the requirement of entropy conservation . since the schottky term gives only a very small contribution in the high - temperature region ( above 1.5 k here ) , if @xmath68 had a power law as required by a nodal gap , instead of a flat temperature dependence for an @xmath16-wave gap , the entropy would be clearly not conserved yielding a large negative entropy .",
    "this is of course unreasonable . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we present together the theoretical curves for @xmath69 calculated using the weak coupling bcs formula    @xmath70    where @xmath71 . in obtaining the theoretical fit",
    "we take the implicit relation @xmath72 derived from the weak coupling bcs theory for superconductors with different pairing symmetries : @xmath73 for @xmath16 wave , @xmath74 for @xmath15 wave , and @xmath75 for @xmath33 wave , respectively .",
    "the theoretical curve of @xmath16 wave fits the experimental data very well leading to an isotropic gap value @xmath76 = 0.94 mev and @xmath4 = 5.7 k. the ratio @xmath77 = 1.91 obtained here is quite close to the prediction for the weak coupling limit ( @xmath77 = 1.76 ) , indicating a slightly moderate coupling strength .",
    "this is self - consistent with the conclusion derived from the estimation on @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the specific heat anomaly at @xmath4 is @xmath78 1.64 being close to the theoretical value 1.43 predicted for the case of weak coupling , again showing a slightly moderate coupling .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "4(b ) shows a field induced part @xmath79 . in an @xmath16-wave superconductor @xmath79",
    "is mainly contributed by the vortex cores and a linear relation @xmath80 is anticipated@xcite in the low field region with @xmath81 .",
    "this linear relation is well demonstrated by the data below 0.7 t , indicating another evidence of @xmath16-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the results in cuprates where a @xmath82 relation is expected due to the doppler shift of the nodal quasiparticle spectrum in a @xmath15-wave superconductor@xcite .",
    "the theoretical curves calculated with @xmath15-wave and @xmath33-wave models can not describe the data in both the low - temperature and high - temperature regimes@xcite .        in the following we try to estimate the superconducting condensation energy @xmath83 for the sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k. in calculating @xmath83 we get the entropy difference between the normal state and the superconducting state by @xmath84 , then @xmath83 is calculated through @xmath85 .",
    "the data of @xmath86 and @xmath87 as well as the difference between them are shown in insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "5 , respectively . the main frame of fig . 5",
    "shows the temperature dependence of the condensation energy @xmath8 which is about 369 mj / mol at @xmath58 = 0 k. this value can actually be assessed by the following equation    @xmath88    for a bcs @xmath16-wave superconductor , @xmath89 = 1 , taking @xmath6 = 43.9 mj / mol k@xmath30 and @xmath76 = 0.94 mev , we found a value of @xmath90 367 mj / mol which is remarkably close to the experimental value 369 mj / mol .",
    "this also validates the values of @xmath76 and @xmath6 determined in our experiment .",
    "now we discuss the possibility of impurity scattering which may suppress the spin - triplet component of the superconductivity .",
    "theoretically it is known that the nodal gap structure is very sensitive to the impurities .",
    "if the spin - singlet and triplet components are mixed , the latter might be suppressed by the impurity scattering and the system would behave like a bcs superconductor . although we can not exclude this possibility at this moment , it is safe to conclude that the spin - triplet component ( if it exists ) should be a very small part of the total condensate .",
    "this can be justified by the following two arguments .",
    "first , for the sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k , we found that @xmath32/@xmath91 = 24% . assuming that the total @xmath32 were induced by the impurity scattering of this spin - triplet component",
    ", the ratio of the dos corresponding to the normal state of this part would be less than 24% .",
    "actually one would not expect that the total value of @xmath32 here could be ascribed completely to the suppressed spin - triplet component since the xrd data does show the existence of some secondary ( nonsuperconducting ) phase which will certainly contribute a certain value of dos .",
    "second the self - consistency among the derived values of the normal state sommerfeld constant , the appropriate ratio of @xmath77 and the electron - phonon coupling strength ( see next section ) together with the nice fit of the specific heat data to the bcs model all can push the spin - triplet component to a very low limit .",
    "nevertheless , as a future work it is worthwhile to have an inspection on this issue on a sample with complete purity .",
    "and @xmath92 ) ( bottom ) under different dc magnetic fields for the sample with @xmath4 = 3.7 k. it is clear that the dc magnetic field makes the transition shift parallel to low temperatures with a much faster speed compared with the sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k. , width=302 ]        now we get to the electron - phonon coupling in mgirb . from the normal state value we have derived the phonon contribution @xmath93 with @xmath94 5.4 mj / mol k@xmath29 . using the relation @xmath95 = @xmath96 , where @xmath97 = 6.02 @xmath98 is the avogadro constant , z = 45 is the number of atoms in one unit cell",
    ", we get the debye temperature @xmath99(mgirb ) = 253 k for the sample with @xmath4 = 5.7 k. if the conduction electrons are weakly coupled with the phonon , one can use the mcmillan equation to evaluate the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath36",
    "via@xcite    @xmath100,\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 is the coulomb pseudopotential taking 0.11 . using @xmath95(mgirb )",
    "= 253 k and @xmath4 = 5.7 k , we obtain @xmath36 = 0.66 , indicating a slightly moderate coupling strength . the value determined here",
    "is quite close to @xmath36 = 0.68 which was determined previously based on the comparison between the normal state sommerfeld coefficient @xmath6 and the theoretically estimated dos at @xmath34 .",
    "all these detailed and self - consistent analysis indicate an electron - phonon coupling mechanism for superconductivity in mgirb .    at this moment , it is still unclear that the conduction electrons are strongly coupled to which phonon branch leading to the superconductivity . during the preparation of samples , it was found that the superconducting transition temperature is changeable in a wide region ( from 2 k to 5.7 k ) in mgirb with a rather sharp transition width .",
    "this is actually a rare case in the alloy superconductors in which the off - stoichiometric elements normally play as the scatterers and break the cooper pairs and finally make the transition broad . in mgirb",
    "a slight off - stoichiometry may not change the structure , but promote the mutual - substitution leading to a different electron - phonon coupling strength . in fig .",
    "6 we show the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the ac susceptibility of another sample ( @xmath4 = 3.7 k ) which was made also in two steps but with 20% more mg added in the second step .",
    "one can see that the transition width at zero field is still quite narrow and the x - ray diffraction pattern taken on this sample is reasonably clean ( not shown here ) .",
    "an estimation on the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath36 based on the mcmillan equation on this sample tells that @xmath102 0.55 . in fig .",
    "7 we present the upper critical field @xmath103 taken with the criterion 10%@xmath104 for the two selected samples with @xmath4 = 5.7 k and @xmath4 = 3.7 k. one can see that the slope @xmath105 is very different between these two samples . actually in the previous work of the princeton group@xcite , @xmath105 can be as high as 1 t / k . in a dirty type - ii superconductor ,",
    "it was predicted@xcite that @xmath106 with @xmath107 in connection with the electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "it is thus reasonable to ascribe the variation of @xmath108 and @xmath4 to different electron - phonon coupling strengths and different density of states at @xmath34 .",
    "all these quantities may be optimized in future work and hopefully will lead to a higher superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the basic parameters and properties derived in this work provide a playground for the future study in this interesting system .",
    "in summary , analysis on the low - temperature data in mgirb finds an @xmath16-wave pairing symmetry with a gap in the weak coupling to slightly moderate coupling regime and the superconductivity is induced by the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the spin - triplet component , if it exists , should remain as a small part of the total condensate . tuning the superconducting transition temperature seems possible through changing the electron - phonon coupling strength and the density of states at the fermi level by varying the relative compositions among the three elements and probably also by mutual substitution .",
