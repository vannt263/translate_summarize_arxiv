    "the standard model of the lanthanides successfully explains most of magnetic properties and , within _ ab initio _ calculations , also the equilibrium lattice parameter , bulk moduli and cohesive energy ; actually , the picture of localized @xmath0-electrons works much better for compounds with rare earths than the picture of fully delocalized @xmath0-electrons .",
    "nevertheless , it is not sufficient for an explanation of all the complex physical and chemical properties .",
    "a recent example is given in the neutron scattering experiment on pr metal  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism which can provide the -localization , has been recognized long ago as the intra shell coulomb interaction , which forms large energy gaps between occupied and unoccupied @xmath1- or @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "it has been explained within hartree - fock approximation by brandow  @xcite in connection with physics of mott insulators and explicitly exploited in such phenomenological theories , as lda+u  @xcite , self - interaction corrected lda dft  temmerman , svane1 .",
    "it is clear that this picture is a bit oversimplified , since in many cases it is difficult to describe a local subsystem of materials within a single - electron approach .",
    "lda - dft is not a single - electron theory since it goes beyond the hartree - fock approximation at least up to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "however , it is also well - known that without formation of an energy gap with the help of sic or lda+u between @xmath2-orbitals it is difficult to obtain electron localization in practical implementations of dft .    however , in total energy calculations within the local density approximation to density functional theory , it is possible to treat the @xmath0-electrons either as core ( or valence ) electrons , obtaining localized states .",
    "irrespective of if the -states are localized or delocalized , there is a problem of taking into account strong correlations between @xmath0-electrons of non - filled shells , since the expression for the exchange - correlation potential usually is based on the expression derived from the theory for _ homogeneous _ electron gas .",
    "the treatment of @xmath0-electrons as core states also requires a prescription of how many of them should be forced to be localized in the core .",
    "even though the total energy may may be minimized with respect to the -occupation  @xcite this approach must rely on experimental data of the -shell and it has problems of including fluctuations or non - integral occupations of the -states . a theoretical method that attempts to describe all the intricate properties of - ( and @xmath1- ) electron materials , such as heavy fermion behavior , kondo effects , mott insulators ( with a transition from a metal to insulator ) , unconventional super - conductivity , hybridization gaps etc .",
    ", must be build on a many body framework , and it seems that a fruitful way to do this is to join many body corrections and electronic structure methods .",
    "the main motivation for this combination is that the many body theory described accurately the correlated - ( sometimes _ d_- ) states , whereas electronic structure methods treat the diffuse , more extended states well .",
    "here we suggest to look at the problem using a theory of strongly correlated electrons ( sce ) .",
    "we would like to combine field - theoretical methods with dft .",
    "for the electrons which are localized the approach starting from the atomic limit seems to be appropriate .",
    "the derivation of the connection between dft and many - body theory for the total energy , given by sham  @xcite uses the expression for the total energy  @xcite which contains the sum of all skeleton graphs .",
    "the theory of sce from the atomic limit is based mainly on the pauli - principle ( e.g.  for destruction operators @xmath3 ) . since some infinite sequence of graphs of perturbation theory from the weak - coupling side ( say , for the self - energy for the fermion green function ( gf ) ) corresponds to the expression where the relation like @xmath4 has been used within the strong - coupling perturbation theory , it is not easy to find this sequence and provide a one - to - one correspondence between these perturbation theories .",
    "it is possible , however , to express the fermion gfs in terms of gfs for many - electron operators . here",
    "we will exploit this connection .",
    "the description within the framework of the lda to dft , when the @xmath0-electrons are treated as core electrons with only a certain number of @xmath0-orbitals occupied may be provided within the many - body approach in the following way .",
    "let us consider an ion which has @xmath5 @xmath0-electrons in the ground state number .",
    "then , only the transitions @xmath6 will be involved in the formation of the spectrum of the _ single - electron _ excitations while all other transitions , like @xmath7 , involving larger number of electrons will be strongly suppressed by a large energy separation between these states .",
    "if we , in such theory , take the limit when the energy of the atomic - like transition @xmath8 between any @xmath9 and @xmath5-electron states @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the @xmath0-ion is much higher than the fermi energy , @xmath12 , the number of @xmath0-electrons in the ion will be fixed . indeed , in this limit this upper  single - electron ",
    "level @xmath13 is empty . in the rare earth elements the populated part of the @xmath0-spectral density corresponding to the transitions @xmath14 is much below @xmath15 .",
    "it can also be ( much ) below the bottom of the conduction - electron bands .",
    "this mechanism leads to a self - consistent switching off of the mixing interaction ( see figures 4,5,6 for lda+hubbard - kanamori corrections in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and removes the overlap between these core - like levels and the conduction electrons .",
    "thus , this physical picture exactly corresponds to a type of _ ab initio _ calculation with a fixed number of localized electrons .",
    "the photo - electron spectroscopy experiments , show that even in the rare earth elements , for which this picture seems to be most appropriate , the level @xmath16 is sometimes only slightly above fermi energy .",
    "therefore , due to mixing interaction it should contribute to the cohesive energy  @xcite .",
    "the total energy of the system and fermion gfs can be calculated in a simple approximation by making use of the theory developed in ref .",
    "this allows to construct the sham equation for the exchange - correlation potential and to derive corrections to the standard lda expression .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ ciagf : sect ] , in order to provide an opportunity to directly compare the contributions from coulomb interaction to the equations of motion for gfs in wcpt and scpt , the equations of motion are written exactly via functional derivatives of the gfs in wcpt ( see section  [ ciagfa : sect ] ) and in scpt ( see section  [ ciagfb : sect ] ) within a real - space non - orthogonal representation . here",
    "we introduce the approximation of renormalized fermions ( arf ) , which allows us to establish a one - to - one correspondence between certain subsequences of graphs in wcpt and scpt .",
    "this fact is used further for the formulation of an recipe for a correlation corrected form of lda on the basis of the analysis by sham  @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential for a normal and a correlated system . in section  [ standard : sect ] we discuss the standard model for the lanthanides and compare the self - energies within wcpt and scpt in the arf . since",
    "the graphs which are not taken into account by this approximation can be written explicitly , this allows us to establish the domain of validity of the standard approach to the case when the system has ( quasi)localized electrons , and , also , suggests a possible recipe to overcome the difficulties existing in the lda in dft .",
    "section  [ disc : sect ] contains the conclusions and a discussion .",
    "the contributions to the equations of motion for the gfs are rewritten via functional derivatives of gfs .",
    "this allows to construct a regular scpt via an iteration procedure for the equations for the gfs . in appendix",
    "[ 3-level : app ] we discuss the transfer of spectral weight between the low and high energy regions and show the role played by spectral weights in the formation of the orbital polarization in the simple example of 3-orbital atoms with 2 strongly interacting electrons .",
    "perturbation theory from the atomic limit should , on one hand , be constructed in real space in order to be able to treat the single - site coulomb interactions better than within the lda .",
    "the wave functions centered on different atoms are not supposed to be orthogonal to each other . on the other hand , we have to compare the perturbation series for the gfs within weak coupling and strong coupling .",
    "for this reason we have to understand how the equations reflect the non - orthogonality of the basis set . here",
    ", we shortly repeat the well - known kadanoff and baym derivation for the exact expression for the self - energy and obtain the first corrections which we will compare with the ones obtained from the scpt approach later .",

    "the facts which we are going to exploit further are : 1 ) the galitskii - migdal formula , eq.([tote : eq ] ) , gives the total energy in the approximation chosen for _ fermionic _ gfs ; 2 ) the fermionic gfs can be expressed in the form of a linear combination of the gfs for the hubbard operators ; 3 ) the lower intra atomic fermi - like transitions give only core - like contribution to the energy .",
    "the latter statement will be considered in the next section . in the region of strong intra atomic coupling",
    ", the self - energies @xmath99 for fermionic gfs also can be found for many cases by making use of the scpt where a non - perturbative calculation should be used for the interaction between electrons in each ion , but perturbative ones with respect to the interactions connecting different ions . how to calculate the gfs for hubbard operators",
    "is discussed in next subsection and the details are given in appendix [ coul_eq_of_mot : app ] .",
    "if the hubbard intra atomic repulsion is strong enough the perturbation theory from the atomic limit generates the following physical picture .",
    "the partially filled @xmath1- ( or @xmath0- ) shell is separated by a large energy gap to two subs hells .",
    "one of them can be viewed as core - like states , while the other one can , in a certain approximation , be described in terms of effective , renormalized , fermions  @xcite .",
    "these quasi - fermions behave very similar to the fermions in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "however , this simple picture arises only within the lowest approximation where the upper hubbard sub bands are similar to the corresponding sub band of the so - called hubbard - i approximation in the hubbard models and the decay of the quasi - particles is only due to normal scattering of these quasi fermions caused by coulomb intersite interaction . the scattering on collective excitations like spin waves , etc .",
    ", as well as the scattering caused by kinematic interactions , is not taken into account .",
    "in this case the fermi - liquid type of decay ( @xmath100 ) still holds  @xcite at low temperature and excitation energy .",
    "our aim will be to show that , in the _ ab initio _ calculations , for materials where the strong correlations are not developed very much due to the suppression by the a strong localization of a part of a shell , one can use the standard expression for the exchange - correlation potential even in the case of strong electron correlations ( sec ) with the difference that a modified expression for the charge density should be used and , also , hopping , mixing and overlap matrixes should be slightly renormalized . in general case",
    "the renormalization constants , however , can not be found without the system of equations for the gfs derived within scpt .",
    "after some simplifying assumptions only one constant enters the equations and , therefore , only one equation should be added ( see next paper ) .",
    "the idea of the derivation performed consists of the following .",
    "the density functional theory is based on an self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham equations for the charge density and potential .",
    "the key question is , of course , from where does one take the analytical form for this potential .",
    "usually it is taken from the theory of the _ homogeneous _ electron gas and phenomenologically extended to the case of non - homogeneous systems .",
    "sham  @xcite , using the hohenberg and kohn theorem  @xcite , has suggested a theory which connects the exact exchange - correlation potential with the exact self - energy .",
    "although it is far from obvious that the same holds for the case of an approximate self - energy , we will use this assumption .",
    "sham and schlter  @xcite managed to solve this equation for the case of semiconductors within the approximation of spherical charge spheres and found that the analytical form in this approximation is the same as in the case of an phenomenological extension of the theory of homogeneous gas .",
    "at last , kotani  @xcite has shown that the results of the standard dft - lda calculations for the total energy are well reproduced within the static random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "these facts can be used as follows . if we manage to    \\1 . establish a one - to - one mapping between a subset of the feynman graphs for the self - energy within scpt and wcpt ( at least , in rpa ) and    \\2 .",
    "show that the sham equation for the exchange - correlation potential within this subset of graphs has the same form as its analogue in wcpt and    \\3 .",
    "derive the expression for the charge density @xmath101 within the approximation in the scpt , which is the analogue of the rpa in wcpt ,    then , the analytical form for the exchange - correlation potential in this approximation should be the same as in the standard case , but the usual expression for the charge density @xmath102 should be changed to @xmath103 : @xmath104\\rightarrow v_{xc}[\\rho _ { p}(r)]$ ] , as well as the matrix elements of different interactions should be renormalized as it is required by the mapping . since the lda for the exchange - correlation potential works well for the case of delocalized electrons , we , thus , have to show that any graph in wcpt describing the coulomb interaction between the electrons which belongs to one site and the other either to another site , or to the delocalized states , has its counter - part in the scpt . as follows from the formulas for total energy and the sham equation , both require knowledge of the full _ fermionic _ gfs .",

    "the latter means that any feynman graph obtained within a weak - coupling expansion has its counter - partner in the strong - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "attention has to be paid to the fact that the number of renormalized fermions does not coincide with the number of ordinary fermions : the number of the latter is equal to the number of _ orbitals _ involved , while the number of the former is equal to the number of _ fermi - like transitions _ involved .",

    "second , the degeneracy is certainly overestimated : the first hund rule is caused by the intra - atomic exchange integrals , but the splitting between different orbitals may be a few such integrals ( say , the transitions between three - electron states and two electron ones cover the range from @xmath320 to @xmath321 , where @xmath322 is exchange integral ) ; the next - order coulomb interactions , which are responsible for the second hund rule , are also much greater than room temperature ; at last , the spin - orbit coupling , for example , in rare earths provides a splitting of ev - order , between the multiplets .",
    "thus , if the atomic - like hund rules are not fully destroyed we find in a zero approximation that only one of the population numbers @xmath323and , therefore , due to the sum rule , @xmath324 , all remaining @xmath325 .",

    "thus , let us switch on the hopping and mixing .",
    "we have to distinguish the hubbard sub bands originating from empty and filled orbitals since hopping for them are different .    in the case of empty orbitals the hopping @xmath328 since they have energies above fermi energy , where the potential barrier between atoms either is absent or is small",
    "however , as we have seen in the previous section , the dispersion of the lower hubbard sub band is negligible due to the small weight of these orbitals in this region of energies . in the case of filled orbitals",
    "the dispersion in the lower hubbard bands is also negligible since @xmath329 is small due to the large width and height of the energetic barriers between atoms ; near the upper transition their spectral weight is small .",
    "thus , the only dispersion which is physically important is the dispersion of the empty orbitals near the upper transitions . above",
    "we have shown that the switching of the mixing and hopping leads to the appearance of non - zero spectral weights , above the fermi level for the filled orbitals and for the empty orbitals in the region of lower transitions .",
    "but the dispersion in the latter region is negligible for both type of orbitals .",
    "therefore , the role of delocalized electrons is played by delocalized upper transitions of the empty orbitals and we can use this fact in order to derive some recipe for how to correct the exchange - correlation potential . on the other hand",
    ", we can in the general formulas use the approximation @xmath330 as well as the overlap matrix with neighbors should be zero .",
    "this leads to a disperse - less lower hubbard band . as we see , eq.([stand1:eq ] ) and ( [ stand2:eq ] ) correspond to the standard model for the lanthanides if the upper transitions will not contribute to the cohesive energy and this situation arises when the energy of the upper transition @xmath331 . as known from electron spectroscopy",

    "however , as we have seen above , if the mixing interaction of the conduction bands with the upper transition is not equal to zero , the spectral weight at both , upper and lower energies , deviates from unity and , therefore , it is desirable to correct the localized model at least in this place",

    "hubbard used the coulomb matrix element of density - density type for @xmath362 . according to the common opinion , it has unreasonably large values , between 20 and 30 ev for a @xmath1-shell , and , therefore , is considered irrelevant . in lda+u calculations ",
    "reasonable  values of @xmath362 for transition metals are near 5 - 8 ev  @xcite , while in recent calculations , based on dynamical mean field theory , in order to obtain a reasonable agreement with the spectroscopical data for iron the authors had to take a value of about 3 ev  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , no suggestions what mechanism that is responsible for such a drastical decrease of @xmath29 from 20 to 6 ( or even to 3)ev .",
    "the common believe is that delocalization plus screening , particularly , due to interaction with some other bands , may provide such a decrease .",
    "it is easy to see , that at least , the density - density interaction with other bands does not change the picture .",
    "indeed , let us imagine , that besides , say , a @xmath1-shell the atom also contains another shell with @xmath363 atoms . if we add the term @xmath364 to the energy , it changes @xmath234 and @xmath235 @xmath365 but does not change @xmath362 : @xmath366 .",
    "earlier  @xcite we also investigated the influence of the delocalization on @xmath362 via renormalization by ( kinematic ) mixing interaction , it gives a decrease of at most 10% under favorable conditions .",
    "therefore , either other mechanisms should be involved or the description in terms of one parameter @xmath362 is oversimplified . from our consideration given above we can conclude that both assumptions are relevant .",
    "first , it is important , which experiment we want to compare with .",
    "it is well - known that for _ ab initio _ dft lda calculations the excited states with large energy of excitations are difficult since they usually involve non - single - electron excitations and the latter are not included into the effective single - electron kohn - sham scheme ( even with different corrections ) .",
    "however , in low - energy experiments the lower hubbard band is not involved .",
    "therefore , for the description of such experiments one is interested only in the properties of the upper hubbard band .",
    "the model calculation , which are trying to work with energies separated by a large scale , usually does not take into account self - consistent changes of the charge density .",
    "this involves the strongest interactions existing in the system .",
    "therefore , it looks like only methods which combine the ab initio methods with the many - body theory might be able to treat such problems . within our many - electron approach",
    "the important parameters of the system are @xmath361 and @xmath16 .",
    "they are connected with the model parameter hubbard @xmath29 , however , they have , obviously , many - electron nature .",
    "second , there are two reasons why it is very important , where the levels @xmath361 and @xmath16 are situated with respect to all other bands and the chemical potential : a ) this influences the distribution of spectral weights ; b ) the efficiency of screening depends on it . actually , the lower the transition is under the fermi level , the less the coulomb interaction , via which it interacts with other electrons , is screened ( see the speculations about the one loop contribution to the polarization operator , eq.([rpa_looop : eq ] ) ) .",
    "third , the way of calculation , obviously , depends on the reference point which interactions are included into @xmath367 if we start with the lda picture with a certain number of localized electrons , we have self - consistent @xmath0-wave functions , from them we can construct of the wave functions of the many - electron states , and calculate the energies @xmath368 without any relaxation of charge .",
    "the differences of these energies provides @xmath369 .",
    "it should be emphasized that in this approach the lda based calculation is used only as a generator of a convenient minimal set of wave functions for calculating @xmath368 .",
    "the energies themselves should be calculated on the basis of the many - electron states , @xmath370 .",
    "then , one can switch on mixing and hopping and take into account the screening and the renormalization of @xmath369 via the self - energies of the many - electron gfs .",
    "let us start with the lower transition .",
    "if we denote the coulomb interaction between the localized and delocalized electrons as @xmath371 delocalized - delocalized as @xmath372 it is clear that the largest contribution to self - energy for the renormalization of @xmath361 comes from the graphs which contain the lowest possible number of interactions @xmath373 , because , as we have seen in previous section , each loop constructed on @xmath373 involves the loop with large denominator of the order of @xmath374 .",
    "therefore , the largest contribution to the self - energy with density - density matrix elements @xmath373 , renormalizing the lower transition , contains @xmath375 only twice ( see the graph in fig .",
    "[ loop : fig ] and fig .",
    "[ loop2:fig ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the equations for the lower ( and for upper as well ) gfs always form a system of equations , @xmath376\\}g^{a_{4}\\bar{a}_{1^{\\prime } } } ( i\\omega ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath377 is the hartree contribution and @xmath378 is the full polarization operator . however ,",
    "if we neglect the differences between the levels @xmath361 , we can write the equation for renormalized @xmath361 : @xmath379 where @xmath380 takes into account the number of internal transitions , @xmath381 in eq.([gfupper : eq ] ) .",
    "the situation with the upper transition is more complex since in this region the bands are formed . for this reason",
    "it can be defined via the static dielectric permeability as a solution of the equation with hartree and , screened by static @xmath382 , exchange interaction , i.e in the eq.([gfupper : eq ] ) using instead of the second term with @xmath383 and @xmath384 and @xmath385 replaced by @xmath25 and @xmath386 . as we see , the self - consistent magnitudes @xmath387 become frequency - dependent already in the first steps of their dressing by electron - hole excitations .",
    "this makes such calculations quite cumbersome and practically difficult .",
    "the other possible way would be to calculate , as described above , the non - self - consistent values of @xmath369 and to treat them as the input parameters for further lda calculations , where they will be renormalized as centers of bands usually do .    in conclusion",
    ", we have reported the following results .",
    "the perturbation theory for correlated electron systems developed in previous paper here is extended to the case of coulomb interaction .",
    "it is shown in the level of closed functional equations for the many - electron green functions that all the contributions in scpt can be separated to two classes .",
    "one of them forms the approximation of renormalized fermions , arf , does not include kinematic interactions , and is fully analogous to the wcpt for single - electron gfs .",
    "another one includes them and , therefore , contains specific for ces effects .",
    "the arf is used for formulation of simple recipe for extension of the lda to dft to the case of strongly correlated electrons . the application",
    "to rare earths is given in next paper .",

    "@xmath518 , \\;b_{k}^{2}=1-a_{k}^{2}.\\ ] ] we consider the situation when the bottom of the conduction band is above the energy of the lower transitions , @xmath519 , and the energy of the upper transition is above the fermi energy , @xmath520 . since the level @xmath521 before switching hopping and mixing was empty , the band @xmath522 , being transformed into @xmath523 changing is filled only slightly and , therefore , @xmath524 . within the accuracy",
    "we need this makes it sufficient to replace the sum @xmath525 by @xmath526 , i.e.  to find it without self - consistency , using non - perturbed values for the population numbers .",
    "then , @xmath527 becomes just a given small number ( which value we do not need to know here ) .",
    "therefore , although the analytical form of the gfs , @xmath528 , coincides with the @xmath529 but the population numbers in the numerators , which determine the spectral weights , are slightly redistributed . since",
    "a further analysis is possible only numerically , in order to get some impression of what is changed let us formally write down the population numbers in terms of @xmath530 using the sum rule for the population numbers and the gfs @xmath531[111,011]},g^{[101,111][111,101]},g^{[110,111][111,110]}$ ] : @xmath532},\\;n_{110}=\\frac{% 1-\\theta } { 1+\\theta \\lbrack e_{1}+e_{2}]},\\nonumber \\\\",
    "n_{011}&=&\\frac{\\theta e_{1}}{1+\\theta [ e_{1}+e_{2 } ] } ,   \\;n_{101}=\\frac{\\theta e_{2 } } { 1+\\theta [ e_{1}+e_{2 } ] } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e_{1}&\\equiv & e^{\\beta ( u/2-\\mu -h_{eff})},e_{2}\\equiv e^{\\beta ( u/2-\\mu ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since at @xmath533 we have that @xmath534 and equal to unity when the degeneracy is removed , it is clear that @xmath535 . using this",
    ", we can write down an approximate expression for the fermion gf , @xmath536 we can neglect a weak and non - important dispersion @xmath537 in the lower pole since this hubbard sub band is fully filled and does not contribute to the cohesive energy of the system .",
    "however , the important thing following from this expression is that due to the delocalization of the orbital in the region of energies @xmath538 the bandwidth of the band decreases , the spectral weight in upper pole is also decreasing from unity to @xmath539 , and in a lower pole a small , but non - zero weight arises .",
    "thus , we see that the function @xmath540 is reduced indeed to the form of @xmath541 only in the case when @xmath542 . since all other population numbers are not equal to zero , @xmath543 and the picture based on an effective single - electron potential should be corrected .        _ first _",
    ", since a non - zero spectral weight of the orbitals 1 and 2 has appeared at the energy @xmath546 and the energetic barrier between the neighboring ions is not that wide nothing prevents a hopping between these orbitals belonging to different ions to develop , as well as mixing of these orbitals with the conduction bands .",
    "therefore , the self - consistency loops should lead to the formation of bands due to hopping , etc .",
    "it should be noted , that the magnitude of the shifted spectral weight is small because its value is determined by the competition between the hund - rule intra - atomic exchange energy and cohesive energy due to a delocalization of the empty part of the @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "the latter essentially depends on the degree of proximity of the upper transition @xmath235 to the fermi energy  @xcite , and , as will be seen below , the hund - rule integrals split the upper transitions .",
    "this also leads to a suppression of the band formation with the transitions which are much above fermi energy .",
    "_ third _ , these bands are narrowed by the spectral weights .",
    "although this is a well known effect from the studies of the hubbard models , this is important in our discussion of an possible improvement of the _ ab initio _ calculations : even when sic mimics the orbital polarization and improves essentially the description of the matter  @xcite , it does not provide a fully correct physical picture .",
    "_ fourth _ , not only the bandwidth of the band @xmath548 is decreased , @xmath549 $ ] , but , also , a part of the spectral weight is moved from the high - energy region @xmath550 to the low - energy @xmath498 ( see the eqs for the fermionic gfs @xmath24 ) . since usually the main contribution to the value of the moment comes from the localized orbitals , one can expect a slight deviation ( decrease ) of this moment from an integer value . in rare earths",
    "this effect is weak , but it is clear that , for example , in compounds with intermediate valence the deviation of the moment from integer is quite strong .",
    "thus , this effect of the transfer of the spectral weight occurs due to delocalization of one of the transitions ( detailed consideration of the mechanism of delocalization due to a correlation - caused transfer of spectral weight is given in a recent paper  @xcite ) .",
    "_ fifth _ , when a long - range magnetic order arises in the system , the effective field , shifting the lower levels , as discussed above , changes the magnitudes of all population numbers ( again due to the sum rule ) ; the latter may change the bandwidth . thus , if the correlated bands are involved into the formation of magnetism , the essential physics of the formation of the magnetic moment consists not in a rigid ( self - consistent ) shift of the bands , but in the changes of the bandwidths involved . from the technical point of view",
    "the lesson which one can extract from the consideration of this model is the following .",
    "the speculations , based on equations ( [ kalle1:eq ] ) and ( [ kalle2:eq ] ) and which lead us to the eq.([ff_exp : eq ] ) might be considered as a ground for the _ ab initio _ calculations either within the standard model for the lanthanides and , also , within the sic method , where sic is applied to some of the orbitals .",
    "some of the orbitals are fully localized and are placed very deep in energy either  by hands  in first case , or by a sic potential in the second one , while only the orbitals remaining at higher energies are delocalized . however , as we see from eq.([f_hia : eq ] ) this picture is not fully correct it misses the shifts of the spectral weights . as we shall see below , a very simple recipe to correct for this exists . in spite of the simplicity of the approximation , hubbard - i , used in this example ( which is the same in spirit as the arf , discussed in the previous section ) , should reflect the mechanisms of the spectral weight transfer correctly since the driving mechanism is the sum rules , which comes from the exact commutation relations .",
    "therefore , the mechanisms discussed above are expected to remain valid in higher approximations ."
