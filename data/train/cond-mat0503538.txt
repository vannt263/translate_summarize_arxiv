    "a great experimental achievement is the ability to grow epitaxially well defined monolayer and sub - monolayer ferromagnetic films .",
    "such films serve as model systems in which to study basic aspects of magnetic ordering in low dimensions as well as to test theories of magnetism .",
    "results gleaned from these studies have wide impact across several areas from critical phenomena to electronic band structure theory .",
    "there are also important implications for applications because the issues involved lie also at the heart of problems in interface magnetism .",
    "a problem of particular importance is the formation of magnetic anisotropies in thin transition metal magnetic films .",
    "critical phenomena in low dimensional magnets and the formation of magnetic anisotropies are linked together at a fundamental level .",
    "long range order in two dimensional magnets depends upon the long wavelength behaviour of the goldstone mode of the spin system .",
    "this behaviour is strongly affected by the existence of a zero momentum energy gap . in most real systems ,",
    "the largest contribution to this gap comes from second order corrections to the exchange energy associated with electronic correlations creating the ordered state .",
    "these corrections appear in the form of magnetic anisotropies determined by spatial symmetries of the local atomic environment .",
    "anisotropy formation is a higher order effect in the sense that the energies involved are much less than the energy associated with the ordering temperature @xmath4 . in two dimensional systems ,",
    "the local fields responsible for magnetic anisotropies are very different from the local fields existing in three dimensional bulk systems , and the same reduction in dimensionality has a profound effect on the critical behaviour of the system . in real magnetic systems accessible to experimental study",
    ", the formation of magnetic anisotropies and the critical behaviour of the magnetization are therefore inextricably linked .    in this paper",
    "we show that there are striking features associated with magnetic anisotropies which appear in spectra produced by spin wave excitations in two dimensional ferromagnets .",
    "there are very clear and measurable finite temperature effects produced by anisotropies that can be observed below the ordering temperature , and we demonstrate that one can also observe easy and hard directionality in magnetic excitation energies above the ordering temperature .    a few experiments in epitaxial ultrathin ferromagnetic films have explored the nature of the phase transition and the persistence of magnetic anisotropies well above @xmath4;@xcite a similar effect was observed in quasi - two - dimensional easy - plane ferromagnets.@xcite the role of the energy gap in stabilizing ferromagnetic order in two dimensions is well known in critical phenomena , but less well understood in terms of experiment .",
    "experimentally , the gap can be observed from the spectra of long wavelength spin waves , and can be most clearly seen by taking the magnetic system through a reorientational transition with the application of a static magnetic field along a hard anisotropy direction.@xcite theoretically , the equilibrium configuration can be determined , _ e.g. _ by the vanishing of the total static torque acting on spins : for small fields the magnetization orients between the direction of the field and the closest symmetry axis of the anisotropy until , at some specific critical magnetic field strength @xmath8 , a reorientation of the magnetization along the field direction occurs . as regards the spin wave excitations away of the equilibrium state , at low temperatures their energy can be easily calculated , using the holstein - primakoff transformation from spin operators to boson operators,@xcite in the framework of a non interacting spin wave theory.@xcite for @xmath6 the spin wave energy is essentially determined by the anisotropy but , as @xmath1 increases , the energy barrier to deviate away from the easy axis gradually decreases until , for @xmath1 greater than @xmath8 , the field itself constitutes an energy barrier .",
    "this results in a minimum value for the energy of a spin wave at @xmath8 . within free spin wave theory , valid at low temperatures ,",
    "this minimum is predicted to be exactly zero for zero wavevector.@xcite it is the aim of the present paper to investigate , at higher temperatures , the field dependence of the equilibrium configuration and of the energy of the magnetic excitations of a ferromagnetic monolayer with a uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "two different theoretical approaches have been used , namely mean field theory ( mft ) and green s function theory ( gft ) .",
    "the different predictions of these theories are exposed in sections ii and iii , respectively , both above and below the curie temperature @xmath4 . within mft",
    "a constant magnetization modulus is predicted for field smaller than the reorientation field , whereas within gft a more accurate treatment of spin fluctuations leads to a field dependence of the magnetization modulus in the same field range . as a consequence , for finite temperature @xmath9 , we find that the two theories give qualitatively different results as regards the order of the field - induced transition : within mft the reorientation of the magnetization is continuous and the magnon energy gap vanishes at the reorientation field ; within gft the reorientation is discontinuous and the gap does not vanish at @xmath8 . above @xmath4 ,",
    "both theories are able to account for anisotropy effects on the energy of the magnetic excitations , but quantitative differences are present .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "we consider a magnetic monolayer with hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic exchange interaction , @xmath12 is a uniaxial single - ion anisotropy favoring the @xmath13 direction in the monolayer plane ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is an external magnetic field applied in plane : see fig .  1 . the last term in eq .",

    "the thermal average @xmath26 referred to the local frame can be calculated self consistently in terms of the classical langevin function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the exchange field is parallel to the magnetization while the shape demagnetizing field does not provide any preference for a particular in - plane direction . the equilibrium value for the angle @xmath30 that the magnetization forms with the crystallographic easy axis z is determined by requiring the vanishing of the static torque @xmath34 .    for field along the easy axis , @xmath35",

    "( [ equilibrium : mft ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the finite temperature mean field theory predicts a vanishing resonance frequency of the uniform mode just at @xmath74 as a consequence of the continuous in - plane reorientation of the magnetization .",
    "the behavior of spin wave energies in the high temperature regime above @xmath4 is made particularly interesting by the reduced dimensionality of the system . in two dimensional magnets ,",
    "the spin system is highly susceptible to perturbations and can respond strongly even at temperatures above @xmath4 .",
    "this means that a two dimensional ferromagnet in the paramagnetic regime can still produce large scale correlations when in a static applied field .",
    "furthermore , these correlations are sensitive to the orientation of the applied field relative to the symmetry axis of the anisotropy .    for temperatures above @xmath4",
    "a finite magnetization is possible only in the presence of an applied field .",
    "furthermore , since the reorientation field is found to vanish at @xmath75 , the field - induced magnetization will align parallel to the applied field .",
    "a simple estimate of the resonance frequencies above @xmath4 can thus be made expanding the langevin function for high temperatures ( small @xmath69 ) @xmath76 .",
    "for field along the easy axis ( @xmath35 ) and along the hard axis ( @xmath38 ) , respectively , the resulting resonance frequency is @xmath77 @xmath78^{{1\\over 2 } }    \\left [ 1 + 4 \\pi g\\mu_{b } \\gamma_{-}(t)\\right]^{{1\\over 2 } } \\label{omegahigh}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 .",
    "the frequencies have a linear dependence on field with different temperature dependent slopes . the slope is smaller for the field in the hard direction because in that case the anisotropy reduces the torque acting on the spins , thereby reducing the susceptibility with respect to the easy case .",
    "although mean field theory has proved useful to study reorientation transitions in multilayer films,@xcite it is well known that it grossly underestimates the effect of single site anisotropy in heisenberg models@xcite and that it leads to estimates of the critical temperature generally too high due to the neglect of spin correlations . as the reorientation field depends on anisotropy and on the temperature dependence of magnetization",
    ", one can expect that mean field theory is not capable of providing results that can be compared quantitatively with experiments in high quality epitaxial systems . a green s function theory using",
    "the random phase approximation@xcite appears to be a better choice since it provides a more correct treatment of both issues , namely single site anisotropy and spin correlations .",

    "to treat the reorientation transition was provided by the authors of ref . , who proposed a theory based on a generalization of the callen@xcite decoupling valid for an arbitrary direction of the external field .",
    "in this work we present a green s function approach which was developed independently from ref . .",
    "we start from the outset for rotation of the quantization axis for fields below the reorientation transition : _",
    "i.e. _ , we write the green s functions equations of motion in the local reference frame . next , by a careful treatment of the uniaxial anisotropy through a generalized callen decoupling@xcite of the higher order green s functions , we obtain - in a very simple way even in the case of field applied along the hard axis - both the equilibrium condition and the frequency of the magnetic excitations at finite temperature @xmath3 . as a consequence of the generalized callen s decoupling , the validity of our theory is limited to low values of the ratio @xmath80 between the uniaxial anisotropy and the exchange constant . for high values of @xmath81 ,",

    "coming back to our green s function approach , we observe that complete agreement with ref .",
