    "in recent years there has been much interest in the development of computational models for simulation of fluid dynamics based on particle interactions @xcite . in many problems of fluid simulation ,",
    "the potential energy of a moderate number of particles is enough to represent some macroscopic behaviors .",
    "however , to study properties such as mobility of colloids , chemical reactions of macromolecules , fluid diffusion in crowded media , or dynamics of phase segregation , a large number of particles is required to obtain good descriptions . for such problems ,",
    "several techniques of mesoscopic simulation have been implemented ; for example , lattice gas automata @xcite , lattice boltzmann method @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics @xcite , smoothed particle dynamics @xcite and multiparticle collision dynamics @xcite .",
    "each of these techniques provides a coarse - grained approach that incorporates conservation laws and the essential physics while omitting corpuscular details .",
    "multiparticle collision dynamics , also known as stochastic rotation dynamics @xcite , is a particle - based technique for complex fluids that includes thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "multiparticle collision dynamics has proven to be capable of simulating many soft - matter systems , including colloid dynamics @xcite , polymer and proteins dynamics @xcite , vesicles @xcite and reactive systems @xcite .",
    "multiparticle collision dynamics has also been employed to investigate the properties of chemical reaction in crowded environments ; i.e. , media containing obstacles @xcite .",
    "in particular , due to their spatial and temporal scales , binary fluid systems are susceptible to be simulated through multiparticle collision techniques .",
    "there are two main approaches to simulate a binary fluid in the context of multiparticle collision dynamics . the first one , proposed by hashimoto et al .",
    "@xcite , incorporates an additional collision step in the multiparticle collision scheme to guide the mean particle flow of each species in the direction of its density gradient .",
    "the authors studied segregation phenomena in a binary fluid and observed the formation of drop - shape domains with curvatures that can be described by laplace s law .",
    "an extension of this approach has been used to describe amphiphilic fluids @xcite and compounds consisting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts @xcite .",
    "although this extension of the multiparticle collision technique conserves energy and momentum , it has not been proven that it leads to thermodynamically consistent results @xcite .",
    "the second approach extends multiparticle collision dynamics to a binary mixture where collisions between particles of different species occur in supercells while the rest of the multiparticle collision process is carried out in smaller cells @xcite .",
    "this approach can simulate phase separation phenomena , although with the use of a shifting technique to ensure galilean invariance @xcite .",
    "however , phase separation is achieved at very low temperatures that usually introduce strong correlations among particles .    in this article",
    "we propose a multiparticle collision model with a repulsion rule to investigate phase separation processes in a binary fluid in both free and crowded environments . in section",
    "ii we present the model and introduce the repulsion rule for the collision dynamics between the centers of mass of particles from different species . we show that this rule keeps galilean invariance and preserves the mass and the energy of the system , and discuss the conservation of momentum . in sec .",
    "iii the model is employed to study the behavior of a binary fluid in a free environment .",
    "we investigate several phenomena in a wide range of temperatures , including the stability of an interface front between the two species , phase separation , and phase growth , and calculate the characteristic parameters for such processes .",
    "the simulation results are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical models . in sec .",
    "iv we simulate the properties of a binary fluid in a crowded environment by considering particles of both species moving through a random distribution of stationary obstacles . under this conditions , we describe the stabilization of the interface and the formation of domains .",

    "<S> we propose a model to study symmetric binary fluids , based in the mesoscopic molecular simulation technique known as multiparticle collision , where space and state variables are continuous while time is discrete . </S>",
    "<S> we include a repulsion rule to simulate segregation processes that does not require the calculation of the interaction forces between particles , thus allowing the description of binary fluids at a mesoscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the model is conceptually simple , computationally efficient , maintains galilean invariance , and conserves the mass and the energy in the system at micro and macro scales ; while momentum is conserved globally . for a wide range of temperatures and densities </S>",
    "<S> , the model yields results in good agreement with the known properties of binary fluids , such as density profile , width of the interface , phase separation and phase growth . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the model to study binary fluids in crowded environments with consistent results . </S>"
