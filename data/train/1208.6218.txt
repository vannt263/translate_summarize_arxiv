    "the inclusive charged particle @xmath0 spectrum in nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions is an important tool for studying high-@xmath0 particle suppression in the dense qcd medium produced in high - energy aa collisions  @xcite . the suppression ( or enhancement ) of high-@xmath0 particles",
    "can be quantified by the ratio of charged particle @xmath0 spectra in aa collisions to those in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath6 ) , known as the nuclear modification factor @xmath7  @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 = @xmath10 can be calculated from a glauber model accounting for the nuclear collision geometry @xcite .",
    "the measurement presented here is based on @xmath11  tev pbpb data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosities of 7  @xmath12 and 150  @xmath13 , collected by the cms experiment in 2010 and 2011 , respectively .",
    "the pp reference spectrum measured at the same nucleon - nucleon collision energy corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 230  @xmath13 .",
    "a detailed description of the cms detector can be found in ref .",
    "the central feature of the cms apparatus is a superconducting solenoid , providing a magnetic field of 3.8  t. immersed in the magnetic field are the silicon pixel and strip tracker , which are designed to provide a transverse momentum resolution of about 0.7 ( 2.0)% for 1 ( 100 ) gev / c charged particles at normal incidence , the lead - tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter , the brass / scintillator hadron calorimeter , and the gas ionization muon detectors .    in this analysis",
    "the coincidence signals of the beam scintillator counters ( @xmath14 ) or the hadron forward calorimeters ( hf ; @xmath15 ) were used for triggering on minimum bias events . in order to extend the statistical reach of the @xmath0 spectra , single - jet triggers with calibrated transverse energy thresholds were applied .",
    "the collision event centrality , specified as a fraction of the total inelastic cross section , is determined from the event - by - event total energy deposition in the hf calorimeters .",
    "the inclusive charged particle invariant differential yield averaged over the pseudorapidity @xmath16 in pp collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a )  @xcite . also shown",
    "are the ratios of the data to various generator - level predictions from the pythia mc  @xcite . the pbpb spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectra](b )  @xcite for six centrality bins compared to the measured pp reference spectrum scaled by @xmath9 . by comparing the pbpb measurements to the dashed lines representing the scaled pp reference spectrum ,",
    "it is clear that the charged particle spectrum is strongly suppressed in central pbpb events compared to pp , with the most pronounced suppression at around 510 gev / c .",
    "the computed nuclear modification factor @xmath3 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : raa ]  @xcite .",
    "the yellow boxes around the points show the systematic uncertainties , including those from the pp reference spectrum .",
    "an additional systematic uncertainty from the @xmath9 normalization , common to all points , is displayed as the shaded band around unity . in case of the peripheral 7090% centrality bin ,",
    "a moderate suppression of about a factor of 2 is observed at low @xmath0 , with @xmath3 rising slightly with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "the suppression becomes more pronounced with increasing collision centrality . in the 05% most central centrality bin",
    ", @xmath3 reaches a minimum value of about 0.13 at @xmath0 = 67  gev / c , corresponding to a suppression factor of 7 . at higher @xmath0 ,",
    "the value of @xmath3 rises approaching roughly a suppression factor of 2 between 40 and 100  gev / c .",
