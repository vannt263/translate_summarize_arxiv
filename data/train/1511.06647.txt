    "the sketches show the arrangement of energy levels and the electronic transitions responsible for the resonant excitations of photons .",
    "the two peaks on the right ( corresponding to the sketch labeled by ( 5 ) ) occur at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , when the transitions between the two lower or the two higher energy levels of the dots are in resonance with the microwave oscillator .",
    "this is a straightforward extension of what had been found for a double - dot system with a single level in each dot @xcite .",
    "the same is true for the peak at @xmath90 labeled by ( 2 ) , where the resonant transition is between the upper level of the left dot and the lower one in the right dot .",
    "a completely different situation is found for the peak at @xmath91 ( labeled by ( 3 ) ) here , a cascade of processes is involved : ( i ) an incoherent transition , associated with the excitation of a phonon , from the higher left dot level to the higher right dot level , ( ii ) a transition to the lower left dot level in resonance with the microwave oscillator , ( iii ) another incoherent transition , again associated with the emission of a phonon , to the lower right dot level . note that in this process the resonant electron tunneling is against the main current direction .",
    "the small peak at the left ( labeled by ( 1 ) ) arises in the resonance situation when the transition from the lower level of the right dot to the lower level of the left dot is in resonance with the microwave oscillator .",
    "the peak is small since for the cycle to continue the electron has to escape to the right lead in a higher order or thermally activated process via one of the right dot levels .",
    "another peak at @xmath92 ( labeled by ( 4 ) ) is due to a two - photon resonance process ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is very small for the chosen coupling strength between the dqd and the microwave oscillator but becomes more pronounced with increasing coupling strength .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ pphot_overview ] shows the current as a function of @xmath94 . with our chosen paramters",
    "the current @xmath95 is in the order of @xmath96 .",
    "the dominant feature in the center is a resonant tunneling peak when the lower two levels in the dqd coincide .",
    "there is another peak when the upper two levels are aligned .",
    "however , for the choice of parameters with @xmath97 in this situation the lower left level lies below the levels in the right dot , which means that once it is occupied the coulomb interaction blocks further transport until a higher order or thermally activated process allows an escape to the right lead .",
    "this coulomb blocking reduces the weight of the second resonance tunneling peak .",
    "it is in fact the reason why the current is small for all @xmath98 compared to the current for @xmath99 . at the far right we see another resonance peak when the lower level in the left dot is aligned with the higher level in the right dot . for the chosen parameters the linewidth of these resonance tunnel peaks is determined by the temperature .",
    "in addition we see much sharper peaks in the lasing - type situations when one of the electronic transitions is in resonance with the microwave oscillator .",
    "some of them are two small or too close to the resonance tunneling peaks to be observable at the resolution of the plot .",
    "the more prominent ones at @xmath100 and @xmath101 arise in the two lasing situations labeled by ( 5 ) in the upper panel .",
    "further lasing resonances do show up in the current . in order to display them we plot in the lower of the three panels in fig .",
    "[ pphot_overview ] with higher resolution the difference of the current between the situation with coupling to the oscillator and without .",
    "this plot also displays the novel property that lasing resonance peaks in the photon number associated with backward tunneling processes ( labeled ( 3 ) and ( 1 ) ) lead to a sharp dip in the current .      to test whether and to which extent the observed photon peaks are associated with lasing",
    "we analyze the fano factor @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ pfano ] we show the results in the vicinity of the resonance labeled ( 3 ) , but similar results are found also for the other lasing peaks .",

    "the effect is also visible in the current as shown in the inset of the figure .",
    "also in the process ( 2 ) the transition through the dqd system is strongly enhanced by the phonons , which leads to more pronounced photon peaks .     vs. the detuning @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and for different tunneling strengths @xmath103 .",

    "[ pphot_tunneling ] we illustrate the dependence of the lasing peaks on the tunneling strength @xmath103 .",
    "such a dependence was also checked in the experiments with single - level double quantum dots by stockklauser _",
    "they found that with stronger tunneling strength the hybridization of the levels leads to a merging of the resonance peaks . in our system , for weak tunneling the lasing peaks are very sharp .",
    "with increasing tunneling strength the transport current through the dqd and the population inversion increases which leads to more photons , but eventually also the hybridization of the dot levels becomes stronger .",
    "this leads to broader and weaker peaks , and the peaks are shifted due to the hybridization .",
    "their positions follow from the condition @xmath106 this equation has two solutions for not too strong tunneling @xmath103 ( as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ pphot_tunneling ] ) which determine the positions of the two lasing peaks .",
    "when the tunneling strength is stronger the peaks merge and it is not possible to satisfy the separate resonance conditions anymore . in this case",
    "we still observe an enhanced photon number , but the process is no longer associated with lasing . a physical argument for the disappearing of the lasing peaks may be as follows : for strong hybridization the distinction between left and right levels is lost .",
    "this is , however , crucial for the creation of a population inversion by the imposed current .",
    "electron transport through a double quantum dot system coupled to a microwave oscillator may lead to a lasing state ( strictly speaking a masing state ) with a narrow resonance peak in the photon number and a tendency to a poisson distribution@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that this property of the photon field is reflected also in a peak in the transport current , which provides an alternative to study the lasing state . in the present paper we extended earlier work devoted to dots with one level each @xcite to dots with multiple levels .",
    "as expected we see several peaks of the previously known type but also qualitatively different ones .",
    "in particular we observe that in a cascade of transitions a backward tunneling process leads to a lasing peak in the photon number which is associated with a dip in the transport current .",
    "these multi - level processes involve inelastic transitions , which may occur in the presence of phonons .",
    "we therefore analyzed the multilevel dqd  microwave oscillator system coupled to piezoelectric acoustic phonons .",
    "we used realistic parameters , taken from the experiments of liu _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite including the phonon spectrum as determined in this reference .",
    "the lasing peaks and fano factor are sensitive to the coupling strength and spectrum and may be a useful tool to analyze phonon properties in more detail .",
    "theoretically we analyzed the system in the frame of a quantum master equation , extending earlier work to multiple levels and a detailed analysis of the coupling to phonons .",
    "the description covers various quantum properties , such as the lasing , but we also see the effect of two - photon transitions .",
    "further physical properties of the system , e.g. , spin - degrees of freedom leading to spin - blockade effects @xcite or spin - photon coupling @xcite , could be implemented in this framework .",
