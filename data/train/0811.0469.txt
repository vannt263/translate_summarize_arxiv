    "in phenomena like charge transport in nano - electromechanical systems  @xcite or in life processes like molecular motors or like ion - transport through a single membrane channel , one easily reaches energy scales as low as a few @xmath0  @xcite . therefore , the physics and the chemistry of these small systems must talk about fluctuations , not only because they are very much present but also because some processes actually make use of these fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the experimental output is often in terms of current cumulants , which should inform us about important features of the system dynamics .",
    "a central quantity is the fluctuating current @xmath1 , which gives the time - averaged number of particles or quanta that pass trough a given surface , and its large deviation function @xmath2 , describing the shape of its probability distribution @xmath3 for very long time intervals @xmath4 .",
    "one is interested in its full shape , as its tail can contain signatures of interesting physics .",
    "however , the asymptotic estimate of these tails is problematic as they involve fluctuations that become rare for @xmath5 .",
    "we describe a numerical scheme to compute exactly ( up to numerical round - off s ) the cumulants of these current fluctuations in general small markovian systems .",
    "we emphasize that our algorithm is exact and can be systematically implemented to produce cumulants of in principle arbitrary order .",
    "practical limitations such as memory storage make it however most efficient for the statistical mechanics of systems that are not too large .",
    "finally , our method is based on general theoretical considerations and its interpretation involves a relation between current and traffic ( dynamical activity ) fluctuations .",
    "mathematically , our approach uses a type of rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation expansion for the largest eigenvalue of a matrix that is obtained as a perturbation of the original markov generator ; a full account can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen as a modification and adaption to classical nonequilibrium models , of a technique developed within the framework of full counting statistics for quantum transport  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "our approach is somewhat complementary to a recent efficient algorithm for the ( approximate ) estimate of the large deviation function  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our focus we consider the well studied one - dimensional boundary driven simple symmetric exclusion process ( ssep ) , for which several rigorous results are available  @xcite .",
    "a state is represented by an array @xmath6 of @xmath7 units , which can either be empty ( @xmath8 ) or occupied by one particle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a transition takes place when a particle moves to a neighboring empty site ( with rate @xmath10 ) or if it enters / exits from one of the end sites , which are in contact with reservoirs at different chemical potentials ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath14 ) .",
    "for example , a transition from a state @xmath15 to a state @xmath16 due to the entrance of a particle from the left reservoir ( @xmath17 and the rest of the array is unchanged ) takes place with rate @xmath18 .",
    "observe that we impose the physical condition of local detailed balance , meaning that the rates should obey @xmath19\\ ] ] with some symmetric prefactor @xmath20 . here , we have taken @xmath21 and the irreversible entropy flux from the left particle reservoir is @xmath11 per entering particle .",
    "we expect that systematically a net particle current flows through the system , from the side with higher chemical potential . as we follow the path or trajectory @xmath22 over some time - interval @xmath23 $ ] we can read the number of particles that enter from the left ( left time - integrated particle current ) and the number of particles that exit to the right .",
    "these are of course fluctuating currents , as the path @xmath24 is random with a distribution obtained from the markov dynamics . for our purposes , the information on the dynamics is summarized in the generator @xmath25 , an @xmath26 matrix with elements @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "exactly because of the nonequilibrium condition @xmath30 , the matrix @xmath25 need not even be diagonalizable .",
    "for the final algorithm , that involves a departure from the more standard rayleigh - schrdinger set - up , as we might not have an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors .",
    "to understand the theoretical point of departure of the method , it is useful to separate the time - antisymmetric part from the time - symmetric part in the path - space distribution of the markov process . under the condition of local detailed balance ( [ ldb ] ) , the time - antisymmetric part is directly related to the variable entropy flux and the time - symmetric part measures the dynamical activity , called _ traffic _",
    "@xcite in the system .",
    "because of the normalization of the path - space distribution these two sectors have related fluctuations , as we will make explicit below in .",
    "specifically , we consider ensembles of bonds @xmath31 that all equally contribute to the same time - integrated mesoscopic current @xmath32 . in our example , we can take @xmath33 containing all transitions getting one particle into the system and coming from the left reservoir , and @xmath34 consisting of all transitions in which a particle leaves the system to the right reservoir .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the ensemble of reversed transitions , giving rise to an instantaneous current @xmath36 .",
    "we are then interested in the various moments and correlations between the @xmath37 s",
    ". these can be obtained from the cumulant - generating function @xmath38 in the steady state of the system .",
    "for example the second ( partial ) derivatives with respect to @xmath39 give a covariance between two currents .",
    "the point is now that the exponent in can be read as an excess entropy flux @xmath40 , whose fluctuations are the same as that of a dynamical activity in a markov model with extra driving . to make that last point",
    ", we imagine an extra driving by modifying the rates to @xmath41 for some antisymmetric function @xmath42 , which , allowing some abuse of notation , is @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "one should check the local detailed balance condition ( [ ldb ] ) to see that some extra entropy flux is imposed .",
    "both the original markov process ( with generator @xmath25 ) and the modified one ( with generator @xmath45 ) have a path - space distribution with action , respectively @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and for which @xmath48 & = \\langle e^{-a + \\sum_{b } \\sigma_b j_{b}}\\rangle_{\\text{eq } } \\\\   & = \\langle e^{-a_\\sigma}\\,e^{-a + a_\\sigma + \\sum_{b } \\sigma_b    j_{b}}\\rangle_{\\text{eq } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] with respect to some fixed equilibrium reference dynamics .",
    "if we therefore arrange that the time - antisymmetric parts of @xmath46 and @xmath47 differ exactly by the excess entropy flux , we keep the excess in dynamical activity ( time - symmetric parts ) : @xmath49 for a particular function @xmath50 on the state space , that also depends on the @xmath42 .",
    "that function @xmath51 essentially measures the difference in escape rates from @xmath15 for the original process with respect to the one modified by the @xmath42 s .",
    "the conclusion is a general path - space identity @xmath52 where the last expectation is for the modified steady state .",
    "the formula is more ready for asymptotic evaluation as @xmath53 since @xmath50 is a multiplication operator .",
    "the algorithm must then give a systematic expansion in the @xmath54 of the largest eigenvalue ( in the sense of its real part ) of the matrix @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the matrix with non - zero elements @xmath57k(\\eta,\\xi)$ ] only in ensembles @xmath58 s , where the rates of @xmath45 are different from the rates of @xmath25 .",
    "the details of this expansion are in  @xcite . we just briefly mention that this expansion does not have the advantage of dealing with symmetric matrices , as in the original rayleigh - schrdinger method for quantum mechanical operators .",
    "the solution of the problem goes via the use of _",
    "interestingly , the final results include the group inverse @xmath59 of the generator @xmath25 as a main actor  @xcite .",
    "this matrix contains all the informations needed to compute the dynamical quantities of interest , like the stationary distribution @xmath60 and the cumulants . for example , the variance of a current takes the form @xmath61 ( by @xmath62 we mean a vector of @xmath10 s ) .",
    "we end with a discussion of some results for the open ssep introduced above . for the ssep on a ring , cumulants @xmath63 of the current",
    "have been computed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "formulas for the mean current and its variance are also available for the boundary - driven ssep , while formulas for cumulants of order @xmath64 are known up to order @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "being one - dimensional and finite , there is only one relevant current in the system , which we identify with the entrance of a particle from the left reservoir .",
    "our data , for system sizes up to @xmath66 , at equilibrium with half - filling ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath13 correspond to reservoirs with particle density @xmath68 and @xmath69 in  @xcite .",
    "] perfectly agree with the theoretical value : @xmath70 . in the same conditions , for the fourth cumulant we observe @xmath71 for @xmath72 ,",
    "while to order @xmath65 one has @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : c4 ] ) is slightly different from the one found for the ssep at equilibrium on a ring , where the asymptotic values of the second and fourth cumulants of the current are related by @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the addition of a term @xmath75 to @xmath76 yields a good approximation of @xmath77 for finite @xmath7 also out of equilibrium , see the fig .",
    "[ fig](a ) .",
    "finally , we have tested that the relation ( [ eq : c4 ] ) is not valid for @xmath78 ( no half - filling ) or for @xmath79 ( a case of half - filling out of equilibrium ) , see fig .  [ fig](b ) .    ) of the open ssep as a function of @xmath11 , and the theoretical value ( @xmath76 ) by derrida and coworkers , for @xmath66 and @xmath80 .",
