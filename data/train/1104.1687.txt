    "the analysis of gravitational lensing systems typically proceeds by invoking a thin - lens approximation , where the three - dimensional matter distribution responsible for distorting bundles of light rays is projected into a two - dimensional lens plane .",
    "sources are assumed to be located in a source plane , and the mapping of image locations ( in the lens plane ) to source locations ( in the source plane ) is codified into a lens equation at the heart of nearly all observational studies .",
    "the jacobian of the lens equation map provides the basis for the thin - lens approach to the magnification and shearing of images or weak gravitational lensing .",
    "beginning with frittelli and newman @xcite and perlick @xcite , a number of authors developed the theory of gravitational lensing free from lens and source planes by emphasizing that the null geodesic equations provide the exact versions of the `` time of flight '' and lens equations usually invoked in the thin lens approximation .",
    "around the same time , pyne and birkinshaw @xcite approached the problem of light ray paths and image magnification by perturbatively solving the null geodesic equations .",
    "the exact lens equation approach was first applied to spherically symmetric black hole solutions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has since then been applied in the context of lensing by the rotating black hole at the center of our galaxy @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other work examines black hole lensing , including time delays and magnifications , in the context of relativistic images produced by black holes at the centers of galaxies other than our own @xcite . for cosmological applications widely used in observational strong lensing ,",
    "the accuracy of the thin - lens approximation s predictions of total cluster masses from the appearance of arcs or einstein rings was determined to be approximately @xmath3 in the absence of a suitable truncation scheme @xcite .    following this , a series of papers @xcite , @xcite redefined image distortion from the exact lens equation .",
    "the central idea of these papers was to consider the pencil of rays in an observer s past light cone that connected the observer to an extended source .",
    "the cross - sectional shape of the pencil changes along the past light cone . at the observer ,",
    "the projection of the cross - section is the observed shape of the source , while at the source , the cross - section of the pencil matches the extended source shape .",
    "the shape of the cross - section of the pencil was determined by integrating the geodesic deviation equations continuously .",
    "these papers reproduced the formalism of the thin - lens approach by introducing a jacobian of the exact lens mapping .",
    "in the first paper @xcite , a set of new definitions for shape parameters and image distortion parameters were proposed that measured the total change of the area or ellipticity ( defined as the ratio of semi - major to semi - minor axes ) of the cross - section of the pencil of rays .",
    "these image distortion definitions were applied to schwarzschild black hole geometries . by considering curvature tensors with support only in a lens plane , the second paper in the series @xcite reproduced exactly the thin - lens jacobian and discussed the relation between the optical scalars  the general relativity `` convergence '' ( or divergence ) , @xmath4 , and `` shear , '' @xmath5  and the thin - lens quantities called the same things : @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "frittelli and oberst @xcite then examined image distortion by thick lenses in simple ( non - physical ) models where the ricci curvature was zero and the weyl curvature was in the form of a square barrier .",
    "this paper integrated the optical scalar equations along straight line paths through the thick barrier and discussed the distortion parameters introduced in @xcite .    from the perspective of the astrophysicist analyzing the statistical , weak - lensing signal from real systems ,",
    "these three papers examining image distortion suffer from three significant short - comings .",
    "first , the shape and image distortion parameters introduced in @xcite do not correspond in a natural way to the actual observable quantities .",
    "second , the curvature models considered in these papers are not appropriate for modeling galaxy clusters .",
    "finally , the completely general choice of basis vectors ( which was necessary for examining image distortion in general , say near a black hole ) may prevent the reader from seeing how one would apply the formalism to typical data where the gravitational perturbation is weak .",
    "like the work begun in @xcite , the purpose of the current paper is to re - examine image distortion purely in terms of the physical processes of continuous distortion that occur to a pencil of light rays as the pencil travels from the source to the observer  with no reference to lens planes . unlike the work of pyne and birkinshaw",
    ", we will solve the underlying geodesic and geodesic deviation equations exactly .",
    "we will specifically assume typical statistical weak lensing conditions , including that the gravitational potential provides a weak perturbation of a background robertson - walker metric .",
    "we integrate the optical scalar and geodesic deviation equations in this context and state our results in the language that is customary in the observational lensing community .",
    "the standard references , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , provide a very brief and general discussion of the geodesic deviation equations as the underlying physical description of image distortion .",
    "this paper explicitly formulates in a direct manner the simplest method of integrating the geodesic deviations equations using the newman - penrose spin coefficient formalism applied in the context of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "specifically , we will begin with curvature tensors representing potentially realistic matter distributions , and derive expressions for the general relativity convergence , @xmath4 , and shear , @xmath5 , of pencils of light rays .",
    "then we will integrate the effect of the convergence and shear along the pencil from the source to the observer  finding the size and shape of the image an observer sees of the object .",
    "while this approach is generally well known within the general relativity community , its explicit application to image distortion in the case of weak gravitational lensing is new .",
    "for example , the main equations for image distortion in this method are found in @xcite , but the boundary conditions used there are difficult to apply to the weak lensing case because the shape of the pencil is not known a - priori at the observer .    because our curvature tensors , convergence , and shear are allowed support throughout all of space - time , the approach to image distortion that we will derive represents lensing by `` thick lenses . ''",
    "the study of thick lenses is becoming increasingly important as more examples of merging clusters are found and analyzed , for instance in @xcite .",
    "the physics of merging clusters has important consequences for dark matter models , galaxy formation and stellar history , and x - ray modeling .",
    "our methods also allow us to begin to examine the accuracy of the thin - lens approximation in statistical weak gravitational lensing for reasonable lensing configurations .",
    "we examine the differences in predicted image area and axes ratio for a range of lens models .",
    "we also perform preliminary investigations of weak gravitational lensing by two clusters , closely separated along the line of sight by a varying amount in redshift space .",
    "we assume that we have an observer and a series of sources co - moving in a perturbed flat robertson - walker ( rw ) space - time .",
    "null geodesics connect the sources to the observer and are received simultaneously at the observer .",
    "these null geodesics pass through a region of space - time where the space - time metric is perturbed by a weak gravitational potential , @xmath9 .",
    "we make the customary assumption that @xmath9 depends on proper distances at the time the light rays pass the lens . for instance",
    ", if the potential is spherically symmetric , @xmath9 will depend on @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the time all the null geodesics of the observer s past light cone pass the lens . in this paper , as elsewhere , we assume @xmath12 can be treated as a constant since the scale factor varies slowly compared to the time light passes across the lens @xcite .",
    "the perturbed rw metric is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the usual co - moving time and @xmath15 are cartesian coordinates . throughout the paper",
    ", we will work in units where @xmath16 .",
    "using the conformal time , the metric , eq .  [ m1 ] , is conformal to the static metric    @xmath17    this static metric is a perturbation of a flat , minkowski - space background metric .    for pressureless matter , the gravitational potential satisfies    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a matter density that depends on the proper distance , and the gradient operator is taken with respect to the same proper distance : @xmath20 .    while the cosmology is `` hidden '' in eq .",
    "[ m2 ] , we will make use of the cosmological choice in defining the spatial positions of the lens , source and observer as in @xcite .",
    "we take the background to be a flat rw metric with the hubble constant @xmath21  km / s / mpc , the matter density @xmath22 and the cosmological constant density @xmath23 . in this ,",
    "the scale factor is @xcite    @xmath24    we assume the lens is at a redshift @xmath25 while any sources are at redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "we use the redshift relation , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time a light ray is emitted that is received at an observer at @xmath29 . setting @xmath30",
    ", we can solve for the value of @xmath28 with eq .",
    "[ a1 ] .",
    "then we obtain the radial positions of the source and observer by orienting our coordinates in such a way that a light ray travels radially in the background spacetime and assuming that the observer , lens and source are at least nearly co - linear . integrating radial null geodesics of the flat rw metric , eq .",
    "[ m1 ] , determines the radial positions of the source and observer by ignoring the perturbation introduced by the lens .",
    "in this section , we specify the approximations that apply our formalism to the case of ground - based , statistical weak lensing studies . in typical studies , one finds an average background redshift of all the sources to compute the projected matter density .",
    "this is because the measured gravitational shear is related to the dimensionless projected matter density @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass density of the lens projected along the line of sight and    @xmath33    for angular diameter distances to the lens , source , and between the lens and source . in practice ,",
    "an average background @xmath34 , or an average background redshift , is derived from averaging color information over all the sources to specify an average @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath34 .    in this paper , we assume that the matter distribution is localized near the origin , and that the observer lies at some position along the @xmath37 axis . based on the common practice of finding an average background redshift , we take sources to lie at the same redshift in a source plane at some fixed value of @xmath38 along the @xmath39 axis with @xmath40 .",
    "the observer and sources are far from the region where the gravitational perturbation is large .",
    "the newman - penrose ( np ) spin coefficient formalism @xcite is based on a tetrad of null vectors .",
    "our use of the tetrad vectors is to create complex scalar components of the ricci and weyl tensors by contracting the curvature tensors with the tetrad vectors .",
    "the np tetrad vectors are customarily denoted by    @xmath41    where the first tetrad vector , @xmath42 , is tangent to the past - directed null geodesic connecting the source and observer .",
    "the vector @xmath43 is a complex spatial vector parallel propagated along @xmath42 that can be taken to lie in the cross - section of a bundle of light rays surrounding @xmath42 .",
    "two np components of the ricci and weyl tensors drive image distortion . the ricci tensor component is    @xmath44    and the weyl tensor component is    @xmath45    in principle , the exact tetrad vectors that are null in the perturbed metric are used to find @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , we wish to work consistently to first order in the gravitational perturbation .",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are first order in the gravitational potential , we must use an approximate tetrad that is null in the flat background metric .",
    "if @xmath50 are complex stereographic coordinates that span a sphere s worth of directions , the cartesian coordinate components of the approximate tetrad vectors can be written as    @xmath51    for @xmath52 , the spatial part of @xmath42 points parallel to the @xmath53 axis towards negative @xmath54 values .",
    "the approximate tetrad vectors are allowed to vary along the null geodesic from the source to the observer , or @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a parameter along the geodesic with @xmath57 at the observer .    in the context of statistical , wide - field weak gravitational lensing ,",
    "one studies the distortion of source galaxies that lie behind and `` near '' a large cluster of galaxies that serves as a lens . with a typical dithering of the stacked images from a 4-m telescope ,",
    "ground - based studies see approximately 15 arc minutes to each side of the lensing cluster .",
    "this means that @xmath58 at the observer is small , and , even if it varies along the null geodesic , @xmath55 remains small from the source to the observer .    for the weakly perturbed metric , eq .  [ m2 ] , and approximate null tetrad vectors , eqs .",
    "[ l ] and [ m ] , kling and campbell @xcite show that the curvature tensors are related to the gravitational potential by    @xmath59    and    @xmath60    keeping the first order terms of @xmath9 to be consistent with the weak - field approximation in the metric .",
    "all derivatives are taken with respect to the cartesian coordinates , and @xmath61 .",
    "the ricci tensor , eq .  [ ricci ] , is exact for all values of @xmath58 , but the weyl tensor assumes @xmath58 to be small and discards terms of order @xmath62 or smaller . that the ricci and weyl tensor components do not depend @xmath58 implies that these are dependent only on the position in space @xmath63 along the light ray path for a static perturbation .",
    "the null geodesic connecting the source and observer is part of the observer s past light cone . within this light cone is a pencil of rays that surrounds the null geodesic .",
    "the pencil of rays collapses to a point at the observer ( or the apex of the light cone ) .",
    "the shape of this pencil at the source corresponds to the true shape of the source .",
    "the rate of change of the shape of the pencil is determined by the optical scalars : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the divergence , @xmath4 , measures the rate of the expansion of the pencil .",
    "the complex shear , @xmath5 , measures the rate of change of the `` shearing '' of the pencil , or the tendency of the cross section of the pencil to become elliptically shaped .",
    "if one integrated the null geodesic equations of the perturbed metric , eq .  [ m2 ] , one could find an exact null tetrad @xmath64 . in the spin coefficient formalism",

    "since we are interested in the observational case of the observed shape of intrinsically ( on - average ) circular sources , our approach in integrating the geodesic deviation vectors differs from the presentation in typical references in the general relativity community , for example in @xcite .",

    "the traditional weak lensing analysis of a non - axially symmetric lens involves finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the inverse of the jacobian of the thin - lens mapping .",
    "modern approaches involve solving partial differential equations for the projected gravitational potential @xcite or the projected mass density @xcite .",
    "integrating the true null geodesics has typically been avoided because it was seen as too computationally intensive .",
    "the program for finding image distortion from thick lenses that we outline and implement numerically in this paper demonstrates that thick - lens analysis has become more reasonable .",
    "in fact , the time and computationally intensive tasks of gravitational lensing analysis are image processing , stacking , and shape measurement . while thick - lens analysis involving integrating null geodesics and geodesic deviation vectors may take longer than the corresponding thin - lens analysis , it is at least an order of magnitude smaller task in computation and time than image processing and shape measurement .    nevertheless , in the case of lensing systems that are axially symmetric , we find that the thin - lens approximation generates image ellipses whose area and axes ratio is nearly identical to the corresponding thick - lens analysis .",
    "the errors for axially symmetric systems found in this paper are small compared to observational uncertainties .    in practice",
    ", one observes the averaged ellipticity of sources in a region of the sky since no individual background galaxy is known to be circular . for an object with axes ratio @xmath237",
    ", the ellipticity is defined as    @xmath238    averaging source ellipticities carries with it an intrinsic error determined by the number of objects averaged over and the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion , @xmath239 , as @xmath240 .",
    "typical values of @xmath239 are about @xmath241 .",
    "the density of observed images is typically about @xmath212 useable background objects per square arc minute , as in the dls survey @xcite , or higher by up to a factor of 2 in other current ground - based studies .    in analyzing axially symmetric lensing configurations ,",
    "one typically introduces annular bins for averaging ellipticity measurements .",
    "for instance , one might introduce fifteen annular bins of equal width with the center of the first bin at @xmath242 arc sec and the center of the last bin at @xmath243 arc sec , and then one would average the ellipticity of every object in the bin . within each bin , there would be an expected number of background objects based on the number of objects per square arc minute and the size of the annular bin . for a bins at @xmath242 arc sec and @xmath244 arc sec , the observational accuracies would be approximately @xmath245 and @xmath246 , respectively , for the dls survey .",
    "we see that the observational uncertainties are several orders of magnitude larger than the error introduced by using a thin - lens approximation .",
    "therefore , the thick lens analysis is only of practical benefit if one is attempting to model structure with parameters along the line of sight .",
    "for example , one might attempt to model a galaxy cluster as a triaxial ellipsoid rather than a projection into a two dimensional elliptical matter distribution .",
    "we note that non - truncated sis models are commonly used in weak gravitational lensing studies based on the thin - lens approximation .",
    "however , truncation is important at the scales of wide - field gravitational lensing analysis  even large clusters are not expected to contain a significant mass density past two or three mpc in radius , which is within the field of view for almost all ground - based weak lensing observations of clusters . in this paper , we show that the error in the thin - lens predicted ellipse area and axes ratio spikes at the truncation radius .",
    "this error spike is a needless artifact of poor matter modeling .    of significance to the lensing community , is the finding in this paper that a single lens plane model of two clusters , separated by a significant distance along the line of sight , produces highly accurate image area and axes ratios .",
    "typical weak - lensing surveys are not supported by spectroscopic observations of cluster members , but rely instead on photometric redshifts to determine cluster membership .",
    "we show in this paper that the weak lensing image distortion of two clusters that are significantly separated in distance along the line of sight but close together on the sky can be modeled by a single lens plane to high accuracy .",
    "this is a problem in two regards .",
    "first , studies that attempt to determine the number distribution of clusters of different masses at different redshifts that are based on gravitational lensing may under - count the total number of clusters , and over - state their mass .",
    "second , in studies of structure formation within clusters , if clusters are selected on the basis of weak - gravitational lensing image distortion signals , two well - separated clusters might be mistaken for a single merging object .",
    "these findings argue strongly for spectroscopic follow - up to clusters selected from weak - gravitational lensing surveys to make sure that the cluster members lie at one redshift .",
    "we have integrated the optical scalar and geodesic deviation equations along the null geodesics of a perturbed space - time representing real clusters in a robertson - walker background .",
    "our calculations demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing thick gravitational lenses in a non - perturbative scheme and allow an examination of the underlying accuracy of the common - thin lens approximation .",
    "our principle finding in this context is that the thin - lens approximation is in a sense too good .",
    "namely , we find that if there are two lenses significantly separated along the line of sight , a single lens plane model of these two lenses reproduces the shapes and orientations of image ellipses with an error less than what one could expect from averaging over the images of close - by uncorrelated background sources .",
    "this implies that spectroscopic observations are important supplements to weak lensing observations .",
    "our initial examinations of the thin - lens approximation for weak - lensing image distortion shows that a poor truncation scheme like hard truncation can introduce an error that is as large as the inherent thin - lens approximation error in central regions of a properly truncated model . since wide - field , ground - based studies of weak lensing",
    "do examine the region where the truncation is expected to take place , more careful examinations of the influence truncation on the relative error in area and axes ratio is warranted .",
    "in this appendix , we describe details of the numerical calculations in the paper .",
    "it is most convenient ( for numerical integration ) to scale all the variables by the age of the universe , which we determine by setting @xmath119 in eq .",
    "[ a1 ] and solving for @xmath14 .",
    "this has the effect of making distances from the observer to the source have roughly unit size , and the parameter @xmath56 tends to run from @xmath247 to about @xmath248 depending on arrangements of source and observer .",
    "the effect of the lens on the path of the null geodesic and also the effect on the optical scalar equations take place over a very short range in @xmath56 , so adaptive step - size methods with error corrections need to be used . in this paper , we follow a personal adaptation of the cash - karp implementation of the runge - kutta - fehlberg 4 - 5 adaptive step - size method @xcite .    the null geodesic path and optical scalars , @xmath4 ( or preferably @xmath249 ) and @xmath5 , are first integrated back in time from the observer to the source plane .",
    "an initial observation angle is set at the observer , and the numerical integration continues until the source plane is reached .",
    "we refine the step size to stop at the source plane @xmath54 coordinate value with accuracy to one part in @xmath250 . as the path and optical scalars",
    "are integrated , the values of the optical scalars are passed into an array @xmath251 at every step along the numerical integration .",
    "since @xmath101 is well defined at the observer , an adaptive step - size algorithm would naturally take large steps near the observer . however , @xmath4 divergences at the observer , and this divergence is responsible for making the geodesic deviation vectors vanish at the observer",
    ". therefore , we force the adaptive step - size algorithm to take many small steps near @xmath57 in the integration of the path and optical scalars away from the observer towards the source . for most rays , we store approximately 25,000 to 45,000 steps in the @xmath251 array , with the vast majority of these steps either near the observer or near the lens .",
    "we then integrate the geodesic deviation equations back from the source to the observer , setting the initial conditions at the source to define a circular cross - section of the pencil .",
    "for this integration , we again use an runge - kutta - fehlberg 4 - 5 adaptive step - size algorithm .",
    "we interpolate values for @xmath252 and @xmath253 from the stored arrays by fitting a fourth order polynomial to the nearest four stored data values .",
    "both optical scalars are smooth functions along the integration , although @xmath4 diverges in the limit @xmath254 .    working to double precision throughout , the total accumulated error in the numerical integration of null geodesic and optical scalars ( from the observer to source )",
    "is less than one part in @xmath255 .",
    "the total accumulated error in the numerical integration of the geodesic deviation vector components is estimated from the adaptive step - size algorithm as less than one part in @xmath250 , and the geodesic deviation vector component integration typically proceeds in less than 3000 steps .",
    "however , further numerical analysis of our interpolation indicates that the interpolation might add an error of up to one part in @xmath256 .",
    "if @xmath257 is the value of the parameter of @xmath56 along the geodesic at the lens , we find that there is essentially no change in the projected components of the geodesic deviation vectors , @xmath258 and @xmath259 , for @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , we take the projected limits by setting a floor value of @xmath261 close to @xmath57 and stopping the numerical integration there :      we note that the choice of @xmath263 is somewhat arbitrary , but that the best choice is related to the maximum step - size set in integrating @xmath107 near the observer , as well as the value of @xmath56 where the forced small step size ends .    for the non - axially symmetric cases ,",

    "<S> image distortion due to weak gravitational lensing is examined using a non - perturbative method of integrating the geodesic deviation and optical scalar equations along the null geodesics connecting the observer to a distant source . </S>",
    "<S> the method we develop continuously changes the shape of the pencil of rays from the source to the observer with no reference to lens planes in astrophysically relevant scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the projected area and the ratio of semi - major to semi - minor axes of the observed elliptical image shape for circular sources from the continuous , thick - lens method with the commonly assumed thin - lens approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for truncated singular isothermal sphere and nfw models of realistic galaxy clusters , the commonly used thin - lens approximation is accurate to better than 1 part in @xmath0 in predicting the image area and axes ratios . for asymmetric thick lenses consisting of two massive clusters separated along the line of sight in redshift up to @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> we find that modeling the image distortion as two clusters in a single lens plane does not produce relative errors in image area or axes ratio more than @xmath2 . </S>"
