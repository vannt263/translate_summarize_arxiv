    "the purpose of these lectures is to give an introduction to the present _ standard picture of the early universe _ , which _ complements _ the older standard big bang model .",
    "these notes are intended for non - experts on this subject .",
    "they start with a very short introduction to general relativity , on which modern cosmology is based , followed by an elementary review of the standard big bang model .",
    "we then discuss the limitations of this model and enter into the main subject of these lectures : _",
    "inflation_.    inflation was initially invented to solve some of the problems of the standard big bang model and to get rid of unwanted relics generically predicted by high energy models .",
    "it turned out that inflation , as it was realized later , could also solve an additional puzzle of the standard model , that of the generation of the cosmological perturbations .",
    "this welcome surprise put inflation on a rather firm footing , about twenty years ago .",
    "twenty years later , inflation is still alive , in a stronger position than ever because its few competitors have been eliminated as new cosmological observations have accumulated during the last few years .",
    "modern cosmology is based on einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "it is thus useful , before discussing the early universe , to recall a few notions and useful formulas from this theory .",
    "details can be found in standard textbooks on general relativity ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the framework of general relativity ,",
    "the spacetime geometry is defined by a _",
    "metric _ , a symmetric tensor with two indices , whose components in a coordinate system @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) will be denoted @xmath2 .",
    "the square of the `` distance '' between two neighbouring points of spacetime is given by the expression ds^2=g_dx^dx^. we will use the signature @xmath3 .    in a coordinate change @xmath4 ,",
    "the new components of the metric are obtained by using the standard tensor transformation formulas , namely g_=x^x^ x^x^g_.    one can define a _",
    "covariant derivative _ associated to this metric , denoted @xmath5 , whose action on a tensor with , for example , one covariant index and one contravariant index will be given by _",
    "t^ _ = _ t^ _ + ^_t^ _ - ^_t^ _ ( a similar term must be added for each additional covariant or contravariant index ) , where the @xmath6 are the _ christoffel symbols _ ( they are not tensors ) , defined by ^_=12g^(_g_+_g_-_g _ ) . [ christoffel ] we have used the notation @xmath7 which corresponds , for the metric ( and only for the metric ) , to the inverse of @xmath2 in a matricial sense , i.e. @xmath8 .    the `` curvature '' of spacetime is characterized by the _ riemann _",
    "tensor , whose components can be expressed in terms of the christoffel symbols according to the expression r_^ = _ _ ^-__^+ _ ^_^- _ ^_^.    _ einstein s equations _ relate the spacetime geometry to its matter content .",
    "the geometry appears in einstein s equations via the _ ricci tensor _ , defined by r_=r_^ , and the _ scalar curvature _ , which is the trace of the ricci tensor , i.e. r = g^r_. the matter enters einstein s equations via the _ energy - momentum tensor _ , denoted @xmath9 , whose time / time component corresponds to the energy density , the time / space components to the momentum density and the space / space component to the stress tensor .",
    "einstein s equations then read g_r_-12r g_=8 g t _ , [ einstein ] where the tensor @xmath10 is called the _ einstein tensor_. since , by construction , the einstein tensor satisfies the identity @xmath11 , any energy - momentum on the right - hand side of einstein s equation must necessarily satisfy the relation _ t^ _",
    "= 0 , [ dt0 ] which can be interpreted as a generalization , in the context of a curved spacetime , of the familiar conservation laws for energy and momentum .",
    "the motion of a particule is described by its trajectory in spacetime , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a parameter . a free particle , i.e. which does not feel any force ( other than gravity ) , satisfies the _ geodesic equation _ , which reads t^_t^=0 , where @xmath14 is the vector field tangent to the trajectory ( note that the geodesic equation written in this form assumes that the parameter @xmath13 is affine ) .",
    "equivalently , the geodesic can be rewritten as + ^_dx^d dx^d=0 .",
    "[ geodesique ] the geodesic equation applies both to    * massive particles , in which case one usually takes as the parameter @xmath13 the so - called _ proper time _",

    "one can check that the variation of this action with respect to the metric @xmath2 , upon using the definition t^=2(_mat ) , [ def_tmunu ] indeed gives einstein s equations g_+g_=8",
    "g t_. this is a slight generalization of einstein s equations ( [ einstein ] ) that includes a _ cosmological constant _ @xmath19 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the cosmological constant can also be interpreted as a particular energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath20 .      in this subsection",
    ", the foundations of modern cosmology are briefly recalled .",
    "they follow from einstein s equations introduced above and from a few hypotheses concerning spacetime and its matter content .",
    "one of the essential assumptions of cosmology ( so far confirmed by observations ) is to consider , as a first approximation , the universe as being homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "note that these symmetries define implicitly a particular `` slicing '' of spacetime , the corresponding space - like hypersurfaces being homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "a different slicing of the _ same _ spacetime will give in general space - like hypersurfaces that are not homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the above hypothesis turns out to be very restrictive and the only metrics compatible with this requirement reduce to the so - called _ robertson - walker _ metrics , which read in an appropriate coordinate system ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t ) , [ rw ] with @xmath21 depending on the curvature of spatial hypersurfaces : respectively flat , elliptic or hyperbolic .",
    "the matter content compatible with the spacetime symmetries of homogeneity and isotropy is necessarily described by an energy - momentum tensor of the form ( in the same coordinate system as for the metric ( [ rw ] ) ) : t^ _ = diag(-(t ) , p(t ) , p(t ) , p(t ) ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 corresponds to an energy density and @xmath23 to a pressure .",
    "one can show that the so - called comoving particles , i.e. those particles whose spatial coordinates are constant in time , satisfy the geodesic equation ( [ geodesique ] ) .      substituting the robertson - walker metric ( [ rw ] ) in einstein s equations ( [ einstein ] ) , one gets the so - called _ friedmann - lematre equations _ : @xmath24 an immediate consequence of these two equations is the _ continuity equation _",
    "+ 3h(+p)=0 , [ conservation ] where @xmath25 is the",
    "_ hubble parameter_. the continuity equation can be also obtained directly from the energy - momentum conservation @xmath26 , as mentioned before .    in order to determine the cosmological evolution ,",
    "it is easier to combine ( [ friedmann ] ) with ( [ conservation ] ) .",
    "let us assume an equation of state for the cosmological matter of the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 constant .",
    "this includes the two main types of matter that play an important rle in cosmology :    * gas of relativistic particles , @xmath29 ; * non relativistic matter , @xmath30 .    in these cases , the conservation equation ( [ conservation ] )",
    "can be integrated to give a^-3(1+w ) . substituting in ( [ friedmann ] ) , one finds , for @xmath31 , 3a^2a^2=8g_0(aa_0)^-3(1+w ) , where , by convention , the subscript 0 stands for _ present _ quantities .",
    "one thus finds @xmath32 , which gives for the evolution of the scale factor    * in a universe dominated by non relativistic matter a(t)t^2/3 , * and in a universe dominated by radiation a(t)t^1/2 .",
    "one can also mention the case of a _ cosmological constant _ , which corresponds to an equation of state @xmath33 and thus implies an exponential evolution for the scale factor a(t)(ht ) .    more generally , when several types of matter coexist with respectively @xmath34 , it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless parameters _ ( i)=8 g _ 0^(i)3 h_0 ^ 2 , which express the _ present _ ratio of the energy density of some given species with respect to the so - called _ critical energy density _ @xmath35 , which corresponds to the total energy density for a flat universe .",
    "one can then rewrite the first friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) as ( hh_0)^2=_i_(i ) ( aa_0)^-3(1+w_(i))+_(aa_0)^-2 , with @xmath36 , which implies that the cosmological parameters must satisfy the consistency relation _ i _ ( i)+_=1 . as for the second friedmann equation ( [ friedmann2 ] ) , it implies = -12_i _ ( i)(1+w_(i ) ) .",
    "present cosmological observations yield for the various parameters    * baryons : @xmath37 , * dark matter : @xmath38 , * dark energy ( compatible with a cosmological constant ) : @xmath39 , * photons : @xmath40 .",
    "observations have not detected so far any deviation from flatness .",
    "radiation is very subdominant today but extrapolating backwards in time , radiation was dominant in the past since its energy density scales as @xmath41 in contrast with non relativistic matter ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "moreover , since the present matter content seems dominated by dark energy similar to a cosmological constant ( @xmath43 ) , this indicates that our universe is presently accelerating .",
    "an important consequence of the expansion of the universe is the _ cosmological redshift _ of photons .",
    "this is in fact how the expansion of the universe was discovered initially .",
    "let us consider two light signals emitted by a comoving object at two successive instants @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then received later at respectively @xmath46 and @xmath47 by a ( comoving ) observer .",
    "one can always set the observer at the center of the coordinate system .",
    "all light trajectories reaching the observer are then radial and one can write , using ( [ rw ] ) _ 0^r_edr=_t_e^t_odta(t ) .",
    "the left - hand side being identical for the two successive trajectories , the right - hand side must vanish , which yields -t_ea_e=0 .",
    "this implies for the frequencies measured at emission and at reception a redshift given by 1+z = a_oa_e .",
    "to go beyond a simply geometrical description of cosmology , it is very fruitful to apply thermodynamics to the matter content of the universe .",
    "one can then define a temperature @xmath48 for the cosmological photons , not only when they are strongly interacting with ordinary matter but also after they have decoupled because , with the expansion , the thermal distribution for the gas of photons is unchanged except for a global rescaling of the temperature so that @xmath48 essentially evolves as t(t ) .",
    "this means that , going backwards in time , the universe was hotter and hotter .",
    "this is the essence of the hot big bang scenario .",
    "as the universe evolves , the reaction rates between the various species are modified .",
    "a detailed analysis of these changes enables to reconstruct the past thermal history of the universe .",
    "two events in particular play an essential rle because of their observational consequences :    * primordial nucleosynthesis + nucleosynthesis occured at a temperature around @xmath49 mev , when the average kinetic energy became sufficiently low so that nuclear binding was possible . protons and neutrons",
    "could then combine , which lead to the production of light elements , such that helium , deuterium , lithium , etc ... within the observational uncertainties , this scenario is remarkably confirmed by the present measurements .",
    "* decoupling of baryons and photons ( or last scattering ) + a more recent event is the so - called `` recombination '' of nuclei and electrons to form atoms .",
    "this occured at a temperature of the order of the ev .",
    "free electrons thus almost disappeared , which entailed an effective decoupling of the cosmological photons and ordinary matter .",
    "what we see today as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is made of the fossil photons , which interacted for the last time with matter at the last scattering epoch .",
    "the cmb represents a remarkable observational tool for analysing the perturbations of the early universe , as well as for measuring the cosmological parameters introduced above .",
    "the standard big bang model has encountered remarkable successes , in particular with the nucleosynthesis scenario and the prediction of the cmb , and it remains today a cornerstone in our understanding of the present and past universe . however",
    ", a few intriguing facts remain unexplained in the strict scenario of the standard big bang model and seem to necessitate a larger framework .",
    "we review below the main problems :    * homogeneity problem + a first question is why the approximation of homogeneity and isotropy turns out to be so good .",
    "indeed , inhomogeneities are unstable , because of gravitation , and they tend to grow with time .",
    "it can be verified for instance with the cmb that inhomogeneities were much smaller at the last scattering epoch than today .",
    "one thus expects that these homogeneities were still smaller further back in time .",
    "how to explain a universe so smooth in its past ?",
    "* flatness problem + another puzzle lies in the ( spatial ) flatness of our universe .",
    "indeed , friedmann s equation ( [ friedmann ] ) implies -1 - 1=a^2 h^2 . in standard cosmology , the scale factor behaves like @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for radiation and @xmath53 for non - relativistic matter ) . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath54 grows with time and @xmath55 must thus diverge with time .",
    "therefore , in the context of the standard model , the quasi - flatness observed today requires an extreme fine - tuning of @xmath56 near @xmath57 in the early universe .",
    "* horizon problem + : during standard cosmology , @xmath58 increases ( continuous lines ) , whereas during inflation @xmath58 shrinks ( dashed lines).,width=460 ] + one of the most fundamental problems in standard cosmology is certainly the _ horizon problem_. the ( particle ) _ horizon _ is the maximal distance that can be covered by a light ray . for a light - like radial trajectory @xmath59 and the horizon",
    "is thus given by d_h(t)= a(t)_t_i^tdta(t)=a(t)t^1-q - t_i^1-q1-q , where the last equality is obtained by assuming @xmath60 and @xmath61 is some initial time .",
    "+ in standard cosmology ( @xmath62 ) , the integral converges in the limit @xmath63 and the horizon has a finite size , of the order of the so - called hubble radius @xmath64 : d_h(t)=q1-qh^-1 .",
    "+ it also useful to consider the _ comoving hubble radius _",
    ", @xmath65 , which represents the fraction of comoving space in causal contact .",
    "one finds that it _ grows _ with time , which means that the _ fraction of the universe in causal contact increases with time _ in the context of standard cosmology .",
    "but the cmb tells us that the universe was quasi - homogeneous at the time of last scattering on a scale encompassing many regions a priori causally independent .",
    "how to explain this ?",
    "a solution to the horizon problem and to the other puzzles is provided by the inflationary scenario , which we will examine in the next section .",
    "the basic idea is to invert the behaviour of the comoving hubble radius , that is to make him _ decrease _ sufficiently in the very early universe .",
    "the corresponding condition is that a>0 , i.e. that the universe must undergo a _ phase of acceleration_.",
    "the broadest definition of inflation is that it corresponds to a phase of acceleration of the universe , a>0 . in this broad sense , the current cosmological observations , if correctly interpreted , mean that our present universe is undergoing an inflationary phase .",
    "we are however interested here in an inflationary phase taking place in the very early universe , with different energy scales .",
    "the friedmann equations ( [ friedmann ] ) tell us that one can get acceleration only if the equation of state satisfies the condition p<-13 , condition which looks at first view rather exotic .",
    "a very simple example giving such an equation of state is a cosmological constant , corresponding to a cosmological fluid with the equation of state p=- .",
    "however , a strict cosmological constant leads to exponential inflation _ forever _ which can not be followed by a radiation or matter era .",
    "another possibility is a scalar field , which we discuss now in some details .",
    "the dynamics of a scalar field coupled to gravity is governed by the action [ action_scalar_field ] s_=d^4x(-12^_-v ( ) ) .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor , which can be derived using ( [ def_tmunu ] ) , is given by t_=__-g _",
    "( 12^_+v ( ) ) .",
    "[ tscalarfield ] if one assumes the geometry , and thus the matter , to be homogeneous and isotropic , then the energy - momentum tensor reduces to the perfect fluid form with the energy density = -t_0 ^ 0=12 ^ 2+v ( ) , where one recognizes the sum of a kinetic energy and of a potential energy , and the pressure p=12 ^ 2-v ( ) . the equation of motion for the scalar field is the klein - gordon equation , which is obtained by taking the variation of the above action ( [ action_scalar_field ] ) with respect to the scalar field and which reads ^_=v , in general and + 3h+v=0 in the particular case of a flrw ( friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ) universe .",
    "the system of equations governing the dynamics of the scalar field and of the geometry in a flrw universe is thus given by @xmath66 the last equation can be derived from the first two and is therefore redundant .      the dynamical system ( [ e1]-[e3 ] ) does not always give an accelerated expansion but it does so in the so - called _ slow - roll regime _ when the potential energy of the scalar field dominates over its kinetic energy .    more specifically ,",
    "the so - called _ slow roll _ approximation consists in neglecting the kinetic energy of the scalar field , @xmath67 in ( [ e1 ] ) and the acceleration @xmath68 in the klein - gordon equation ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "one then gets the simplified system @xmath69 let us now examine in which regime this approximation is valid . from ( [ sr2 ] ) ,",
    "the velocity of the scalar field is given by -v3h .",
    "[ phisr ] substituting this relation in the condition @xmath70 yields the requirement : _",
    "v(vv)^2 1 , [ epsilon ] where we have introduced the _ reduced planck mass _ m_p .",
    "similarly , the time derivative of ( [ phisr ] ) , using the time derivative of ( [ sr1 ] ) , gives , after substitution in @xmath71 , the condition _",
    "[ eta ] in summary , the slow - roll approximation is valid when the two conditions @xmath72 are satisfied , which means that the slope and the curvature of the potential , in planck units , must be sufficiently small .",
    "when working with a specific inflationary model , it is important to be able to relate the cosmological scales observed at the present time with the scales during inflation . for this purpose , one usally introduces the _ number of e - foldings before the end of inflation _",

    "decreases _ during the inflationary phase and reaches zero at its end . in the slow - roll approximation , it is possible to express @xmath73 as a function of the scalar field .",

    "given an explicit potential @xmath77 , one can in principle integrate the above expression to obtain @xmath73 in terms of @xmath78 .",
    "this will be illustrated below for some specific models .",
    "let us now discuss the link between @xmath73 and the present cosmological scales .",
    "let us consider a given scale characterized by its comoving wavenumber @xmath79 .",
    "this scale crossed outside the hubble radius , during inflation , at an instant @xmath80 defined by k = a(t _ * ) h(t _ * ) . to get a rough estimate of the number of e - foldings of inflation that are needed to solve the horizon problem , let us first ignore the transition from a radiation era to a matter era and assume for simplicity that the inflationary phase was followed instantaneously by a radiation phase that has lasted until now .",
    "during the radiation phase , the comoving hubble radius @xmath65 increases like @xmath75 . in order to solve the horizon problem ,",
    "the increase of the comoving hubble radius during the standard evolution must be compensated by _ at least _ a decrease of the same amount during inflation . since the comoving hubble radius roughly scales like @xmath81 during inflation , the minimum amount of inflation is simply given by the number of e - folds between the end of inflation and today @xmath82 , i.e. around 60 e - folds for a temperature @xmath83 at the beginning of the radiation era . as we will see later",
    ", this energy scale is typical of inflation in the simplest models .",
    "this determines roughly the number of e - folds @xmath84 between the moment when the scale corresponding to our present hubble radius @xmath85 exited the hubble radius during inflation and the end of inflation .",
    "the other lengthscales of cosmological interest are _ smaller _ than @xmath86 and therefore exited the hubble radius during inflation _",
    "after _ the scale @xmath87 , whereas they entered the hubble radius during the standard cosmological phase ( either in the radiation era for the smaller scales or in the matter era for the larger scales ) _ before _ the scale @xmath87 .    a more detailed calculation , which distinguishes between the energy scales at the end of inflation and after the reheating",
    ", gives for the number of e - folds between the exit of the mode @xmath88 and the end of inflation n(k)62 -+ + + 13 .",
    "since the smallest scale of cosmological relevance is of the order of @xmath57 mpc , the range of cosmological scales covers about @xmath89 e - folds .    the above number of e - folds",
    "is altered if one changes the thermal history of the universe between inflation and the present time by including for instance a period of so - called thermal inflation .",
    "it is now time to illustrate all the points discussed above with some specific potential .",
    "we consider first the case of power - law monomial potentials , of the form [ pot_power - law ] v()=p^4 ( ) ^p , which have been abundantly used in the literature .",
    "in particular , the above potential includes the case of a free massive scalar field , @xmath90 .",
    "the slow - roll conditions @xmath91 and @xmath92 both imply p   , [ sr_pl ] which means that the scalar field amplitude must be above the planck mass during inflation .    after subsituting the potential ( [ pot_power - law ] ) into the slow - roll equations of motion ( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) , one can integrate them explicitly to get ^2-p2- _ i^2-p2 = -24-p ^3-p2(t - t_i ) for @xmath93 and = _ ifor @xmath94 .",
    "one can also express the scale factor as a function of the scalar field ( and thus as a function of time by substituting the above expression for @xmath95 ) by using @xmath96 .",
    "one finds a = a_end .",
    "defining the end of inflation by @xmath97 , one gets @xmath98 and the number of e - folds is thus given by [ n_phi ] n()-p4 .",
    "this can be inverted , so that ( n ) , where we have ignored the second term of the right hand side of ( [ n_phi ] ) , in agreement with the condition ( [ sr_pl ] ) .      if one considers a potential of the form v = v_0 ( - m_p ) , then it is possible to find an _ exact _ solution ( i.e. valid beyond the slow - roll approximation ) of the system ( [ e1]-[e3 ] ) , with a power - law scale factor , i.e. a(t)t^q .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is given by the expression ( t)= m_p .",
    "note that one recovers the slow - roll approximation in the limit @xmath99 , since the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "let us now try to summarize in a few lines the history of inflationary models .",
    "the first model of inflation is usually traced back to alan guth @xcite in 1981 , although one can see a precursor in the model of alexei starobinsky @xcite .",
    "guth s model , which is named today _",
    "old inflation _ is based on a first - order phase transition , from a false vacuum with non zero energy , which generates an exponential inflationary phase , into a true vacuum with zero energy density .",
    "the true vacuum phase appears in the shape of bubbles via quantum tunneling .",
    "the problem with this inflationary model is that , in order to get sufficient inflation to solve the problems of the standard model mentioned earlier , the nucleation rate must be sufficiently small ; but , then , the bubbles never coalesce because the space that separates the bubbles undergoes inflation and expands too rapidly .",
    "therefore , the first model of inflation is not phenomenologically viable .",
    "after this first and unsuccessful attempt , a new generation of inflationary models appeared , usually denoted _ new inflation _",
    "models @xcite .",
    "they rely on a second order phase transition , based on thermal corrections of the effective potential and thus assume that the scalar field is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this hypothesis of thermal equilibrium was given up in the third generation of models , initiated by andrei linde , and whose generic name is _",
    "chaotic inflation _",
    "this allows to use extremely simple potentials , quadratic or quartic , which lead to inflationary phases when the scalar field is displaced from the origin with values of the order of several planck masses .",
    "this is sometimes considered to be problematic from a particle physics point of view , as discussed briefly later .    during the last few years",
    ", there has been a revival of the inflation model building based on high energy theories , in particular in the context of supersymmetry . in these models ,",
    "the value of the scalar field is much smaller than the planck mass .",
    "there exist many models of inflation .",
    "as far as single - field models are concerned ( or at least _ effectively _ single field during inflation , the hybrid models requiring a second field to end inflation as discussed below ) , it is convenient to regroup them into three broad categories :    * large field models ( @xmath102 ) + the scalar field is displaced from its stable minimum by @xmath103 .",
    "this includes the so - called chaotic type models with monomial potentials v()=^4()^p , or the exponential potential v()=^4 ( / ) , which have already been discussed .",
    "+ this category of models is widely used in the literature because of the computational simplicity .",
    "but they are not always considered to be models which can be well motivated by particle physics .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the generic potential for a scalar field will contain an infinite number of terms , v()=v_0 + 12m^2 ^ 2+_33 ^ 3 + _",
    "44 ^ 4+_d=5^m_p^4-d^d , where the non - renormalizable ( @xmath104 ) couplings @xmath105 are a priori of order @xmath57 .",
    "when the scalar field is of order of a few planck masses , one has no control on the form of the potential , and all the non - normalizable terms must be taken into account in principle .",
    "+ in order to work with more specific forms for the potential , inflationary model builders tend to concentrate on models where the scalar field amplitude is small with respect to the planck mass , as those discussed just below . * small field models ( @xmath106 ) + in this type of models , the scalar field is rolling away from an unstable maximum of the potential .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a typical potential is v()=^4 , which can be interpreted as the lowest - order term in a taylor expansion about the origin .",
    "historically , this potential shape appeared in the so - called ` new inflation ' scenario . +",
    "a particular feature of these models is that tensor modes are much more suppressed with respect to scalar modes than in the large - field models , as it will be shown later .",
    "+    * hybrid models ( @xmath107 ) +   for hybrid inflation.,width=460 ] + this category of models , which appeared rather recently , relies on the presence of two scalar fields : one plays the traditional rle of the inflaton , while the other is necessary to end inflation .",
    "+ as an illustration , let us consider the original model of hybrid inflation @xcite based on the potential v ( , ) = 12m^2 ^ 2 + 12 ^2 ^ 2 + 14(m^2-^2)^2 . for values of the field @xmath78 larger than the critical value @xmath108 , the potential for @xmath109 has its minimum at @xmath110 .",

    "moreover , for a wavelength smaller than the hubble radius , one can neglect the influence of the curvature of spacetime and the mode behaves as in a minkowski spacetime , as can also be checked explicitly with the equation of motion ( [ eom_u ] ) ( the effective mass is negligible for @xmath224 ) .",
    "therefore , the most natural physical prescription is to take the particular solution that corresponds to the usual minkowski vacuum , i.e. @xmath225 , in the limit @xmath224 . in view of ( [ general_solution ] ) , this corresponds to the choice u_k = e^-ik(1-ik ) , [ u_k ] where the coefficient has been determined by the normalisation condition ( [ wronskien ] ) .",
    "this choice , in the jargon of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes , corresponds to the _ bunch - davies vacuum_.    finally , one can compute the _ correlation function _ for the scalar field @xmath78 in the vacuum state defined above .",
    "when fourier transformed , the correlation function defines the _ power spectrum _",
    "@xmath226 : 0| ( x_1 ) ( x_2)|0= d^3 k e^i k.(x_1-x_2 ) _(k)4k^3 .",
    "note that the homogeneity and isotropy of the quantum field is used implicitly in the definition of the power spectrum , which is `` diagonal '' in fourier space ( homogeneity ) and depends only on the norm of @xmath227 ( isotropy ) . in our case ,",
    "we find [ ps_phi ] 2 ^ 2k^-3_= |u_k|^2a^2 , which gives in the limit when the wavelength is _ larger than the hubble radius _ , i.e. @xmath228 , _(k)(h2)^2 ( kah ) note that , in the opposite limit , i.e. for wavelengths smaller than the hubble radius ( @xmath224 ) , one recovers the usual result for fluctuations in minkowski vacuum , @xmath229 .",
    "we have used a quantum description of the scalar field .",
    "but the cosmological perturbations are usually described by _",
    "classical random fields_. roughly speaking , the transition between the quantum and classical ( although stochastic ) descriptions makes sense when the perturbations exit the hubble radius .",
    "indeed each of the terms in the wronskian ( [ wronskien ] ) is roughly of the order @xmath230 in the super - hubble limit and the non - commutativity can then be neglected . in this sense",
    ", one can see the exit outside the hubble radius as a quantum - classical transition , although much refinement would be needed to make this statement more precise .",
    "let us now move to the more realistic case of a perturbed inflaton field living in a perturbed cosmological geometry .",
    "the situation is more complicated than in the previous problem , because einstein s equations imply that scalar field fluctuations must necessarily coexist with _",
    "metric fluctuations_. a correct treatment , either classical or quantum , must thus involve both the scalar field perturbations and metric perturbations .    in order to quantize this coupled system ,",
    "the easiest procedure consists in identifying the _ true degrees of freedom _ , the other variables being then derived from them via constraint equations . as we saw in the classical analysis of cosmological perturbations , there exists only one scalar degree of freedom in the case of a single scalar field , which we must now identify .",
    "the starting point is the action of the coupled system scalar field plus gravity expanded up to second order in the linear perturbations .",
    "formally this can be written as s[|+ , g_=|g_+h_]= s^(0)[| , |g _ ] + s^(1 )",
    "[ , h_;| , |g _ ] + s^(2 ) [ , h_;| , |g _ ] , where the first term @xmath231 contains only the homogeneous part , @xmath232 contains all terms linear in the perturbations ( with coefficients depending on the homogeneous variables ) , and finally @xmath233 contains the terms quadratic in the linear perturbations .",
    "when one substitutes the flrw equations of motion in @xmath232 ( after integration by parts ) , one finds that @xmath232 vanishes , which is not very surprising since this is how one gets the homogeneous equations of motion , via the euler - lagrange equations , from the variation of the action .",
    "the term @xmath233 is the piece we are interested in : the corresponding euler - lagrange equations give the equations of motion for the linear perturbations , which we have already obtained ; but more importantly , this term enables us to quantize the linear perturbations and to find the correct normalization .",
    "if one restricts oneself to the scalar sector , the quadratic part of the action depends on the four metric perturbations @xmath159 , @xmath123 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , as well as on the scalar field perturbation @xmath234 .",
    "after some cumbersome manipulations , by using the flrw equations of motion , one can show that the second - order action for scalar perturbations can be rewritten in terms of a single variable @xcite [ v ] v = a(-c ) , which is a linear combination mixing scalar field _ and _ metric perturbations .",
    "the variable @xmath235 represents the true dynamical degree of freedom of the system , and one can check immediately that it is indeed a gauge - invariant variable .",
    "in fact , @xmath235 is proportional to the comoving curvature perturbation defined in ( [ r ] ) and which , in the case of a single scalar field , takes the form = -c+. note also that , if one can check a posteriori that @xmath235 is the variable describing the true degree of freedom by expressing the action in terms of @xmath235 only ( modulo , of course , a multiplicative factor depending only on homogeneous quantities : the @xmath235 defined here is such that it gives a canonical kinetic term in the action ) , one can identify @xmath235 in a systematic way by resorting to hamiltonian techniques , in particular the hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .    with the variable @xmath235",
    ", the quadratic action takes the extremely simple form s_v=12d d^3x , with [ z ] z = a. this action is thus analogous to that of a scalar field in minkowski spacetime with a time - dependent mass .",
    "one is thus back in a situation similar to the previous subsection , with the notable difference that the effective time - dependent mass is now @xmath236 , instead of @xmath237 .",
    "the quantity we will be eventually interested in is the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath199 , which is related to the canonical variable @xmath235 by the relation v =- z . since ,",
    "by analogy with ( [ ps_phi ] ) , the power spectrum for @xmath235 is given by 2 ^ 2 k^-3p_v(k)= |v_k|^2 , the corresponding power spectrum for @xmath199 is found to be [ ps_r ] 2 ^ 2 k^-3p_(k)= |v_k|^2z^2 .    in the case of an inflationary phase in the _ slow - roll _ approximation ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath78 and of @xmath238 is much slower than that of the scale factor @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , one gets approximately , and all results of the previous section obtained for @xmath211 apply directly to our variable @xmath235 in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "this implies that the properly normalized function corresponding to the bunch - davies vacuum is approximately given by v_ke^-ik(1-ik ) .",
    "[ v_k ] in the super - hubble limit @xmath239 the function @xmath240 behaves like v_k- ik i ahk , where we have used @xmath241 . consequently , on scales larger than the hubble radius , the power spectrum for @xmath199 is found , combining ( [ ps_r ] ) , ( [ z ] ) and ( [ v_k ] ) , to be given by _(h^4 ^ 2)_k = ah , [ power_s ] where we have reintroduced the cosmic time instead of the conformal time .",
    "this is the famous result for the spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations generated from vacuum fluctuations during a slow - roll inflation phase .",
    "note that during slow - roll inflation , the hubble parameter and the scalar field velocity slowly evolve : for a given scale , the above amplitude of the perturbations is determined by the value of @xmath238 and @xmath242 when the scale exited the hubble radius . because of this effect , the obtained spectrum is not strictly scale - invariant .",
    "it is also instructive to recover the above result by a more intuitive derivation .",
    "one can think of the metric perturbations in the radiation era as resulting from the time difference for the end of inflation at different spatial points ( separated by distances larger than the hubble radius ) , the shift for the end of inflation being a consequence of the scalar field fluctuations @xmath243 .",
    "rad~aa~h t , and the time shift is related to the scalar field fluctuations by @xmath244 , which implies _",
    "rad~h^2 , which agrees with the above result since during the radiation era @xmath205 ( see eq .",
    "( [ r_psi2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , during inflation , in the case of the slow - roll approximation , the term involving @xmath131 in the linear combination ( [ v ] ) defining @xmath235 is negligible with respect to the term involving @xmath234 .",
    "one can therefore `` ignore '' the rle of the metric perturbations _ during inflation _ in the computation of the quantum fluctuations and consider only the scalar field perturbations .",
    "but this simplification is valid only in the context of slow - roll approximation .",
    "it is not valid in the general case , as can be verified for inflation with a power - law scale factor .",
    "we have focused so far our attention on scalar perturbations , which are the most important in cosmology .",
    "tensor perturbations , or primordial gravitational waves , if ever detected in the future , would be a remarkable probe of the early universe . in the inflationary scenario , like scalar perturbations ,",
    "primordial gravitational waves are generated from vacuum quantum fluctuations .",
    "let us now explain briefly this mechanism .",
    "the action expanded at second order in the perturbations contains a tensor part , which given by s^(2)_g=164gd d^3x a^2 ^_|e^i_j_|e^j_i , where @xmath245 denotes the minkoswki metric .",
    "apart from the tensorial nature of @xmath246 , this action is quite similar to that of a scalar field in a flrw universe ( [ action_ds ] ) , up to a renormalization factor @xmath247 .",
    "the decomposition a|e^i_j=_=+ , v_k,()^i_j(k ; ) e^i k.x where the @xmath248 are the polarization tensors , shows that the gravitational waves are essentially equivalent to two massless scalar fields ( for each polarization ) @xmath249 .",
    "the total power spectrum is thus immediately deduced from ( [ ps_phi ] ) : _",
    "g=2(h2)^2 , where the first factor comes from the two polarizations , the second from the renormalization with respect to a canonical scalar field , the last term being the power spectrum for a scalar field derived earlier . in summary ,",
    "the tensor power spectrum is _",
    "g=2 ^ 2(h)_k = ah^2 , [ power_t ] where the label recalls that the hubble parameter , which can be slowly evolving during inflation , must be evaluated when the relevant scale exited the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "let us rewrite the scalar and tensor power spectra , respectively given in ( [ power_s ] ) and ( [ power_t ] ) , in terms of the scalar field potential only .",
    "this can be done by using the slow - roll equations ( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) .",
    "one finds for the scalar spectrum _",
    "= 112 ^ 2(v^3 ^ 6v^2)_k = ah with subscript meaning that the term on the right hand side must be evaluated at _ hubble radius exit _ for the scale of interest .",
    "the scalar spectrum can also be written in terms of the first slow - roll parameter defined in ( [ epsilon ] ) , in which case it reads _",
    "= 124 ^ 2(v^4_v)_k = ah . from the observations of the cmb fluctuations , _",
    "^1/2=12(v^1/2 ^2_v^1/2)510 ^ -5 .",
    "if @xmath250 is order @xmath57 , as in chaotic models , one can evaluate the typical energy scale during inflation as v^1/4~10 ^ -3~10 ^ 15gev .",
    "the tensor power spectrum , in terms of the scalar field potential , is given by _",
    "g=23 ^ 2(v^4)_k = ah .",
    "the ratio of the tensor and scalar amplitudes is proportional to the slow - roll parameter @xmath250 : [ r ] r=16_v .",
    "the scalar and tensor spectra are almost scale invariant but not quite since the scalar field evolves slowly during the inflationary phase . in order to evaluate quantitatively this variation",
    ", it is convenient to introduce a scalar _ spectral index _ as well as a tensor one , defined respectively by n_s(k)-1=d_(k)dk , n_t(k)=d_g(k)dk .",
    "one can express the spectral indices in terms of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "for this purpose , let us note that , in the slow - roll approximation , @xmath251 , so that = h - v3h^2- m_p^2vv , where the slow - roll equations ( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) have been used .",
    "therefore , one gets n_s(k)-1=2_v- 6 _ v , where @xmath250 and @xmath252 are the two slow - roll parameters defined in ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "similarly , one finds for the tensor spectral index n_t(k)=-2_v . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , this yields the relation r=-8 n_t , the so - called _ consistency relation _ which relates purely _ observable _ quantities .",
    "this means that if one was able to observe the primordial gravitational waves and measure the amplitude and spectral index of their spectrum , a rather formidable task , then one would be able to test directly the paradigm of single field slow - roll inflation .",
    "finally , let us mention the possibility to get information on inflation from the measurement of the running of the spectral index . introducing the second - order slow - roll parameter _",
    "v = ^4 , the running is given by = -24 _ v^2 + 16 _ v _ v -2 _ v .",
    "as one can see , the amplitude of the variation depends on the slow - roll parameters and thus on the models of inflation .      to conclude ,",
    "let us mention the existence of more sophisticated models of inflation , such as models where several scalar fields contribute to inflation .",
    "in contrast with the single inflaton case , which can generate only adiabatic primordial fluctuations , because all types of matter are decay product of the same inflaton , _ multi - inflaton models _ can generate both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , which can even be correlated @xcite .",
    "another recent direction of research is the possibility to disconnect the fluctuations of the inflaton , the field that drives inflation , from the observed cosmological perturbations , which could have been generated from the quantum fluctuations of another scalar field @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "an important challenge remains to identify viable and natural candidates for the inflaton field(s ) in the framework of high energy physics , with the hope that future observations of the cosmological perturbations will be precise enough to discriminate between various candidates and thus give us a clue about which physics really drove inflation .",
    "alternative scenarios to inflation can also been envisaged , as long as they can predict unambiguously primordial fluctuations compatible with the present observations . in this respect",
    ", one must emphasize that the cosmological perturbations represent today essentially the only observational window that gives access to the very high energy physics , hence the importance for any early universe model to be able to give firm predictions for the primordial fluctuations it generates .",
