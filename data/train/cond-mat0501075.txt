    "in the attempt to classify non - equilibrium phase transitions from fluctuating phases into absorbing states  @xcite , the so - called pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) continues to attract considerable attention ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "the pcpd is a reaction - diffusion process that describes a single species of diffusing particles subjected to binary reactions of the form @xmath1 combined with a mechanism which prevents the particle density from diverging . in one spatial dimension",
    "this process exhibits an unconventional type of critical behavior , raising the question whether the pcpd represents a novel universality class of non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of so - called _ fermionic _ lattice models , where each site can be occupied by at most one particle , displayed a slow drift of the effective critical exponents and so far turned out to be inconclusive .",
    "more recently , however , kockelkoren and chat introduced a particularly efficient one - dimensional lattice model , in which the number of particles per site is unrestricted  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previously studied models , where the reactions involve three neighboring sites , the binary reactions  ( [ reactions ] ) are carried out at _ single _ sites , combined with ordinary nearest - neighbor diffusion . unlike fermionic realizations of the pcpd ,",
    "the model introduced by kockelkoren and chat was found to exhibit clean power laws over several decades .",
    "the estimated values of the corresponding critical exponents  @xcite @xmath2 led the authors to the conclusion that the pcpd represents a novel genuine universality class of non - equilibrium phase transitions which differs from all previously known classes .",
    "likewise , they investigated various other reaction - diffusion rules .",
    "in particular they found that the so - called triplet process @xmath3 introduced in  @xcite shows yet another novel type of critical behavior . combining all these results , kockelkoren and chat presented a generic classification table for absorbing phase transitions that comprises four non - trivial classes , namely , directed percolation ( dp ) , the parity - conserving ( or voter ) universality class , the pcpd , and the triplet process .",
    "the results of the present paper indicate that this classification scheme may be premature and needs to be reexamined .",
    "highly optimized large - scale simulations of the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite reveal that kockelkoren and chat , apparently attempting to obtain straight lines in a double - logarithmic plot , systematically underestimated the critical threshold . increasing the numerical effort it turns out that their model does not show clean power laws , instead it is plagued by the very same type strong deviations as observed in previously studied fermionic models .",
    "the effective critical exponents are found to display a slow drift that probably extends beyond the numerically accessible range , most likely approaching an ordinary directed percolation fixed point .",
    "the class of models introduced by kockelkoren and chat is best explained in the case of the pcpd in one spatial dimension ( rule pp12 in their nomenclature ) . consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath4 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site @xmath5 is associated with an integer number @xmath6 that represents the local number of particles .",
    "the dynamics is controlled by a single parameter @xmath7 $ ] and evolves in two synchronized substeps as follows :    * * diffusion : * at first each particle diffuses independently with equal probability to one of the nearest neighbors . * * on - site reactions : * in the second substep all sites @xmath5 , which are occupied by at least two particles , @xmath8 , are updated individually . to this end the particles at a given site are grouped into @xmath9 pairs , where @xmath10 denotes truncation to the largest integral value not greater than the argument .",
    "each of these pairs independently produces one offspring with probability @xmath11 , increasing @xmath12 by @xmath13 , or annihilates otherwise , thus decreasing @xmath12 by @xmath14 .    obviously , when @xmath15 is small , annihilation dominates , leading to an algebraic decay of the density @xmath16 which characterizes the absorbing phase of the pcpd . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 is sufficiently large , particle production dominates and the system approaches a stationary active phase .",
    "note that for @xmath17 the generation of new particles is _ exponentially _ suppressed as @xmath12 increases .",
    "this exponential cutoff , which is the counterpart of the fermionic constraint ( @xmath18 ) in previously studied pcpd models , prevents the particle density from diverging in the active phase .",
    "the update algorithm can be optimized as follows .",
    "because of the exponential cutoff particle numbers greater than @xmath19 are extremely rare so that we can safely restrict their range to @xmath20 . to speed up the on - site reactions we define for each @xmath12 a list of probabilities for the possible outcomes which are then selected by using a single random number .",
    "furthermore , instead of implementing the lattice as a static array , the actual configuration is stored as a dynamically generated list of the coordinates of occupied sites .",
    "these two improvements , combined with some general technical optimizations , accelerate the update algorithm significantly .",
    "let us consider simulations starting with a homogeneous initial state , where each site is occupied by a pair of particles .",
    "kockelkoren and chat studied this case by performing a _ single _ run on a large system with @xmath21 sites simulating up to @xmath22 monte carlo updates ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) . plotting various order parameters in a double - logarithmic representation and seeking for asymptotically straight lines they estimated the critical point @xmath23 . in the improved simulations presented here the temporal range",
    "is extended by almost one decade up to @xmath24 monte carlo updates .",
    "furthermore , using the same system size of @xmath25 sites as in ref .",
    "@xcite we average over at least 40 independent realizations of randomness in order to reduce the statistical error .",
    "density of particles starting with homogeneous initial conditions as a function of time multiplied by @xmath26 for various values of @xmath15 .",
    "the error bars indicate the expected standard deviation averaged over the samples . other order parameters as those studied in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to similar results .",
    "the dashed line represents the slope that corresponds to the critical behavior of directed percolation .",
    ", width=491 ]    the results are shown in fig .  [ figdecay ] . as can be seen",
    ", the curves for @xmath15 equal to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 bend downwards .",
    "consequently the critical point @xmath23 given in  @xcite , including its error margin , lies entirely in the inactive phase .",
    "it seems that kockelkoren and chat , attempting to obtain an apparent power - law behavior , systematically underestimated the critical point .    instead of clean power laws",
    "we observe a slow drift of the effective critical exponents which manifests itself as a weak curvature of the data in fig .",
    "[ figdecay ] that extends over at least four decades in time .",
    "therefore the model introduced by kockelkoren and chat is not a good - natured exception in the zoo of suggested pcpd models , rather it shows the same phenomenological properties as previously studied fermionic variants and is plagued by exactly the same type of slowly decaying corrections to scaling . at the present state of knowledge",
    "there is no reason to believe that the observed drift suddenly stops after @xmath30 or @xmath31 time steps , instead it seems to be more likely that the drift continues to vanish gradually over many decades beyond the numerically accessible temporal range .",
    "therefore , it would be a mistake to search again for straight - looking tails of the curves and to specify updated exponents of a possible pcpd universality class .",
    "however , assuming that the drift eventually vanishes without changing sign , such estimates may serve as upper bounds of postulated asymptotic critical exponents .",
    "for example , analyzing the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figdecay ] one obtains @xmath32 .",
    "similar inequalities are obtained by finite - size and off - critical simulations , as summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".[tab1]estimates for the critical exponents compared with dp exponents . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper demonstrate that the pcpd model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in contrast to earlier claims , does not reach the scaling regime in the numerically accessible temporal range , instead it displays a slow drift of the effective critical exponents , just in the same way as in previously studied fermionic variants of the model with hard - core exclusion . because of this drift the critical exponents estimated by kockelkoren and chat turn out to be incorrect and have to be replaced by the inequalities given in table  [ tab1 ] .    as in all pcpd models",
    "the observed drift is so slow that any attempt to extrapolate the effective exponents to @xmath33 involves to some extent speculative expectations . strictly speaking it is even not yet clear whether such a limit exists , questioning the very existence of a second - order phase transition .",
    "however , in my opinion the numerical results strongly support earlier suggestions  @xcite that the one - dimensional pcpd  including its realization by kockelkoren and chat  may eventually cross over to an ordinary directed percolation transition .",
    "the hypothesis of a dp transition in the pcpd is based on the following argument ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in the numerically accessible range",
    "the pcpd is neither reaction- nor diffusion - limited , instead one observes a spatio - temporal coexistence of clustered reactions and freely diffusing solitary particles  @xcite .",
    "these single particles diffuse over large distances in the 1 + 1-dimensional geometry with the dynamic exponent @xmath34 and their diffusion constant is well - defined and can be read off easily at any time . on the other hand , all simulations in 1",
    "+ 1 dimensions consistently confirm that the critical cluster spreads superdiffusively , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the assumption of a scale - free situation therefore leads to a contradiction unless the diffusion constant flows to zero under renormalization group transformations as the critical point is approached , i.e. , to a situation which is known to belong to the directed percolation universality class .    in the light of the present numerical results the classification scheme introduced by kockelkoren and chat needs to be reexamined carefully by various methods .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to verify their conclusions concerning the triplet process by similar large - scale simulations .",
    "* + i would like to thank a. klein and a. vetter for exclusive access to a new 80-node linux cluster at the university of wrzburg as well as the leibniz computing center in munich , where parts of the simulations were carried out ."
