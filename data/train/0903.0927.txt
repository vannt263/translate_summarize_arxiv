    "in recent years , remarkable developments in two branches of semiconductor physics have been achieved .",
    "one is the theoretical advance in the study of band gaps and quasi - particle spectra in systems , notably transition - metal oxides , where electronic correlation creates states other than simple fermi gas @xcite .",
    "the other is the science of nanomaterials , whose electronic , spectroscopic and transport properties bridge the gap between molecules and condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the search for new technologies in nanoelectronics based on silicon and carbon nanomaterials @xcite has been fueled by the potential applications of such nanoclusters as junctions in optical telecommunication networks or in integrated circuits where serious obstacles are represented by both the signal speed and spatial density . despite many recent advances in the development of carbon based electronics @xcite",
    ", silicon still represents the most widely used physical means .",
    "furthermore , a miniaturization of silicon based devices would retain all our understanding of the physics of this semiconductor and the technological background of the microelectronics industry .",
    "but while the knowledge of the electronic properties of silicon and silicon oxides has advanced greatly , largely due to the development of theories capable of treating the correlation energy @xcite , theoretical results on the secondary emission and energy loss mechanisms are still the subject of discussion @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the o k - ll spectrum from sio@xmath0 clusters .",
    "we present a combination of an ab - initio quantum mechanical method with monte carlo simulations ( qmmc ) to calculate non - radiative decay spectra from sio@xmath0 nanoclusters of different size taking into account post collisional interactions ( pci ) due to electron dynamical screening .",
    "the method is validated by comparison to measured spectra obtained in our group . in this regard ,",
    "we move along two independent directions . on the one hand , we start from the measured spectrum , affected by all kinds of energy losses suffered by the electron on its way out of the solid , and we recover the ` true ' auger spectrum by conventional deconvolution procedures . on the other hand , using the computed o k - ll spectrum as electron source , we use the monte carlo method to simulate the effect of inelastic scattering on the original electron energy distribution .",
    "key ingredient for both procedures is the inelastic scattering cross section or , equivalently , the reflection electron energy loss spectrum ( reels ) . while the well studied @xcite o k - ll spectrum from sio@xmath0 clusters",
    "is taken here as a case study , we believe that our approach is sufficiently general to be applied to the interpretation of core electron spectroscopies , such as photoemission ( pes ) , auger ( aes ) and autoionization by taking into account dynamical screening effects in a variety of nanoclusters and condensed matter systems .    in order to gain new insights into the nature of correlation and of continuum states in nanoclusters , a number of well - defined questions have to be addressed .",
    "what is the nature of the fundamental process occurring in a scattering experiment , where an electron or a photon is injected in the topmost layer ?",
    "what is the nature of the core - hole and double - hole states when electronic relaxations and charge disorder are included ? how does hole localization distort the double - hole density of states ( dos ) and manifest itself in the scattering process ?",
    "what is the role of dynamical screening in the auger process ? can the above considerations be combined to understand experimental data in a unified framework ?",
    "are results size dependent ?",
    "many models , described in several reviews @xcite , have been suggested to tackle the calculation of auger spectra in solids , a difficult task due to the high number of energy levels involved and the contribution of additional degrees of freedom which broaden lineshapes . in particular , computational and theoretical procedures",
    "are represented by methods developed by cederbaum @xcite , ohno @xcite and cini - verdozzi @xcite . in each of these cases ,",
    "auger decay probabilities were computed by means of atomic auger matrix elements with the many - body green function projected onto atomic states and the spectral lineshape obtained by calculating the residua of such a projected quantity .",
    "this approach revealed very valuable in the calculation of atomic and molecular @xcite auger spectra but the extension to solids is fairly difficult and poor in results .",
    "verdozzi and cini @xcite improved such an approach to separate the atomic features from those characteristic of a periodic structure ( see below ) . the striking difference between our approach and those used by all the above",
    "cited authors ( and further extensions of their work ) lies in the computation of the many - body green function .",
    "in fact , in our method the many - body green function is projected onto ` localized ' states , which are a ` local mixture ' of atomic states .",
    "therefore , differently from previous works , our local projectors are multicentered and may include some atomic space points .",
    "in other words , the role played by our projectors is somehow similar to that played by localized wannier functions in solid state calculations .",
    "it is clear that the use of ` localized ' ( not atomic ) auger matrix elements will prove to be very valuable in the treatment of transitions , such as valence - valence - valence ( v - vv ) , where initial states are not atomic , but delocalized in nature .",
    "the quest of multicenter projectors in the calculation of auger matrix elements is of paramount importance , because the use of atomic auger matrix elements , acceptable in molecular spectra , would result in a crude approximation for condensed matter core - hole spectroscopy .    as for core - valence - valence ( c - vv ) spectra",
    ", their understanding is presently based on the use of atomic transition matrix elements and it is rooted in lander s original idea @xcite that such spectra should basically reflect the self - convolution of the valence band dos , so called ` band - like ' spectra . while this is true for solids such as li and si , it fails for transition metals , zn for example , whose c - vv spectra are instead referred to as ` atomic - like ' .",
    "recognizing that correlation effects between the two final - state holes were responsible for such spectra , led to the cini - sawatzky theory @xcite which , derived at first only for systems with initially filled bands , has since become the framework for any quantitative interpretation of c - vv spectra . within this model ,",
    "hole - hole correlation energy is a semi - empirical parameter to be determined by comparison with measured spectra . in particular ,",
    "the effect of hole - hole repulsion on the o k - ll spectrum from bulk sio@xmath0 has been recently investigated by van riessen at al .",
    "@xcite using the cini - sawatzky model extended by ramaker @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is computed by multiplying experimental intra - atomic transition matrix elements times the distorted dos due to hole localization . despite the o k - ll spectrum",
    "could be satisfactorily reproduced , matrix elements and characteristic parameters were taken from atoms , a fact that can be inappropriate for ionic crystals , such as sio@xmath0 , where occupation numbers are different from the atomic ones .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the calculation presented here represents the first attempt to address the questions listed above from first principles , with a full ab - initio treatment of hole - hole correlation and taking into account collective excitations without free parameters , except for a constant factor to normalize spectral intensity .",
    "we will focus on the so - called principal or normal auger process , whereas the contribution of satellites ( associated with shake processes ) to the auger spectrum is neglected .",
    "the general theoretical framework for interpreting auger decay in nanoclusters is the theory of scattering @xcite , where the initial state consists of a projectile , in our case typically photons or electrons , and a target in its ground state , while the final states are characterized by an ionized system and one or more electrons asymptotically non interacting .",
    "the main problem to be addressed for the calculation of the auger theoretical spectrum is the construction of a continuum electronic wavefunction that accurately takes into account correlation effects among electrons bound in the nanoclusters and between the escaping and bound electrons . to build this wavefunction we need to extend a method @xcite",
    "already successfully applied to the calculation of inner shell spectra in small molecules , such as co @xcite and c@xmath0h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of several interacting decay paths , quantum effects due to complex many - body interactions and localization / delocalization effects , make such extension very difficult if one wants to keep the computational cost comparable to that of molecules .    to compute the scattering wavefunctions @xmath1 , including the appropriate _ incoming wave _ boundary conditions",
    ", we use an approach based on fano s multichannel theory @xcite , where the solution to the scattering process is represented by a linear combination of a metastable state @xmath2 with states embedded in the non - interacting continuum many - fold @xmath3 , @xmath4   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "these multichannel continuum wavefunctions can be obtained from a set of interacting continuum states @xmath10 , coupled by the interchannel interaction , by projecting the hamiltonian @xmath11 on a finite set of multicentered @xmath12 functions spanning the hilbert space in the range of the ejected electron kinetic energy : @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the antisymmetric tensorial product of the escaping electron wavefunction at energy @xmath15 with the doubly ionized target wavefunction ( @xmath16 ) . in equation ( [ e999 ] ) @xmath17 is the projected hamiltonian , which includes the projected scattering potential @xmath18 describing the interchannel interaction among bound and emitted electrons in the scattering region .    to find an accurate solution of equation ( [ e999 ] ) in sio@xmath0 nanoclusters , a number of numerical and theoretical techniques have been implemented .",
    "the first problem is the choice of the basis set for the bound states and the scattering wavefunction . due to the large number of atoms and open channels in comparison to molecules , the size of the hilbert space where",
    "the wavefunctions are expanded increases rapidly for nanoclusters .",
    "an increasing number of gaussians may lead to convergence to non - physical states due to basis set superposition errors and linear dependence problems @xcite , particularly in the calculation of metastable states . in order to keep the number of excited determinants in the doubly ionized target low",
    ", we split the problem in two steps : we first calculate the bound orbitals in a restricted gaussian basis set ; we then introduce an auxiliary basis set of modified gaussian functions to compute the matrix elements of the scattering potential ( equation ( [ e1000 ] ) ) .",
    "the hartree - fock procedure takes the variationally optimized atomic wavefunctions of different components of the nanocluster as a starting point for the calculation of the nanocluster wavefunctions , ensuring the convergence of the multiconfiguration procedure @xcite to the appropriate ionic states within the space spanned by a minimal basis set .",
    "an adequate representation of the continuum orbital , comparable to the solution of the multiconfiguration procedure in bound orbitals , forces us to enlarge the basis set in scattering wavefunction calculations .",
    "we emphasize that the scattering basis set is built with a diffuse gaussian basis set multiplied by symmetry adapted hermite polynomials to reproduce the oscillating behaviour of the continuum wavefunctions inside the scattering region .",
    "this enlarged basis set is used both in the expansion of the continuum orbital and in the projection of the interchannel coupling inside the hilbert space spanned by the interacting decay channels .",
    "continuum orbitals have to be orthogonal to bound orbitals . to satisfy this constraint one can use two different methodologies .",
    "one is direct orthogonalization , the other uses projection of the kinetic operator onto the orthogonal complement of the bound states . the latter procedure defines an effective potential , which has the same structure of the phillips - kleinman potential @xcite used in condensed matter calculations for building valence orbitals orthogonal to the core states .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the phillips - kleinman technique leads to numerical instabilities , with a basis set dependence , in the calculation of the sio@xmath0 nanoclusters continuum density of states .",
    "it turned out that such instability is found whenever the eigenvalues of the metrics of the chosen basis set are smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "attention has to be paid , when choosing the basis set , to describe appropriately the scattering potential in the energy region where electrons are emitted and to avoid a small overlap between the basis elements .",
    "after taking into account such a criterion , calculations of the continuum density of states for sio@xmath0 nanoclusters gave the same results in terms of either approach used to satisfy the orthogonality constraint .",
    "due to the enormous number of decay channels coupled with the final states , the auger probability in nanocluster calculations is spread all over the bands with a complex distribution .",
    "accordingly , the computational cost to evaluate the interchannel potential in equation ( [ e1000 ] ) , responsible for the interaction between the open channels and for the probability spread among the non interacting channels , may be so high that it could not be directly performed as previously done for molecules @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , interchannel interaction can not be neglected , because its absence is the main source of errors and of large discrepancies with experimental spectra in scattering calculations @xcite .",
    "one can argue that the strong ionic bond between si and o leads to a rather large interaction .",
    "the electronic cloud distortion , with silicon to oxygen charge donation , favors holes trapping on the oxygen site .",
    "moreover , small multisite interaction among the sio@xmath0 units , is responsible for the narrow valence bandwidth . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects a very low hole mobility , clamped down by a large hole - hole interaction . from these observations ,",
    "one expects that the final states are created by intra - atomic transitions with the two holes strongly localized .    in light of what we have shown above , a theoretical approach for calculating atomic - like and band - like auger lineshapes in nanoclusters with strong correlation effects",
    "is proposed here . in this method both the initial state core - hole and the final state valence holes",
    "are first localized on the central atom and multisite interactions enter naturally in the model hamiltonian as a perturbation .",
    "therefore , a number of localized states , which account for the majority of the decay probability , is selected among the open channels .",
    "these ` tight binding ' states are further coupled via the interchannel potential in such a way that the model hamiltonian can be diagonalized at a very high level of accuracy in a smaller space , corresponding to the most intense open channels .",
    "this calculation results in a number of non interacting states , which account for the quasi - atomic behaviour of the nanocluster . the long range or band - like behaviour of the auger decay",
    "is calculated at this stage by switching on the weak multisite interaction .",
    "the perturbative coupling of each non - interacting channel with a number of states describing transitions close in energy , allows us to choose , among the degenerate states , those presenting a maximum overlap with the selected channel and , therefore , to obtain the whole lineshape .",
    "to test our approach , we take the si@xmath0o@xmath20h@xmath21 nanocluster as representative of bulk sio@xmath0 to calculate the normal o  k - ll auger spectrum . within the born - oppenheimer approximation , the optimized structure of si@xmath0o@xmath20h@xmath21 with a central oxygen atom has been obtained by minimizing the free energy of the electrons at each nuclei position with a smooth fermi - dirac smearing , relaxing the atomic bond length until the forces are less then 0.01 ev / per atom .",
    "the resulting atomic configuration is plotted in fig .",

    "calculations of the bound states have been carried out using a basis set of hermite gaussian functions with ( s , p , d)-type character centered on the nuclei .",
    "the basis set has been obtained by a variational procedure , optimizing the exponents of the standard 6 - 31g@xmath26 basis set . in more detail",
    "we scan a finite range of values above and below the proposed 6 - 31g@xmath26 ones , taking the values which lower the total energy .",
    "an auxiliary basis set , more dense and enlarged with diffuse functions , has been used to represent properly the projected potential @xmath27 in equation ( 5 ) , until variational stability of the auger decay rate with respect to changes in the basis set is reached .",
    "this criterion allows an accurate description of the continuum orbitals around the auger decay energies .",

    "moreover , we observe that the si@xmath0o@xmath20h@xmath21 lineshape is less resolved than the corresponding si@xmath0oh@xmath21 one , as expected due to the increased number of decay channels . though the two computed spectra do not differ much in the number of features and in relative decay rates , the overall agreement with the experimental spectrum slightly favors the bigger cluster .",
    "this observation confirms that our cluster approach is well - suited for the calculation of auger lineshapes from bulk materials and that the 15 atom cluster considered in the present paper is near to the optimal size . in conclusion , we believe that enlarging further the cluster would not change substantially the auger spectral lineshape as expected on the basis of the local nature of aes .",
    "inclusion , in the computed spectrum , of shake - up and shake - off transitions and of interactions between crystal phonons and escaping electron would result in a broadening of the lineshape , correcting for the difference between the computed and experimental linewidth .",
    "we have demonstrated the potentiality of our first principle model for calculating and predicting the lineshapes of x - ray excited auger electron spectra from silicon dioxide nanoclusters .",
    "furthermore , a monte carlo analysis has been applied to the quantum mechanical computation of spectra to mimic the electron energy loss in condensed matter .",
    "comparison to our experimental data reveals a satisfactory agreement , in the energy position and relative intensities of peaks , and in the background contribution over the entire investigated energy range",
