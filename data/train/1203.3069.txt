    "[ [ section-24 ] ]    the total spin - spin correlation is still negative just above 0.1 mev .",

    "[ [ section-25 ] ]    the inclusion of quantum mechanical detailed balance factor in the semi - classical like treatment for dynamics of mobile vortices and anti - vortices , is not even causing any appreciable asymmetry , as seen in the theoretical plots in our case of spin-@xmath0 .",

    "it is worthwhile to point out that same results hold for unbound anti - vortices also .",
    "the laws of quantum mechanics which govern all real systems , ensure the dynamical structure functions to be always positive definite @xcite .",

    "[ [ section-28 ] ]    based on the analysis carried out in the * appendix * we can infer that for the dynamics of mobile vortices and anti - vortices , the negative values of @xmath129 are occurring due to the following factors ; + i ) the choice of the resolution function , whicn in our case is the tukey function , + ii ) the choice of the value of resolution width @xmath130 , which in this case is made fixed by experimentally imposed resolution width , + iii ) use of a semi - classical like treatment to extend the classical theory of dynamics of mobile vortices ( anti - vortices ) to a quasi two dimensional spin @xmath0 ferromagnet which is quantum mechanical .",
    "[ [ section-29 ] ]    to avoid the negativity in the @xmath129 we could have chosen a different resolution function .",

    "an extra smoothening factor can be used to dampen the oscillation of the resolution function .",
    "this extra factor is eventually related to the resolution width and it makes the resolution function smoother if the resolution width is decreased @xcite . however , in our case the resolution width is fixed from the experiment and consequently the oscillation of the resolution function ca nt be avoided by merely changing the resolution function .",
    "[ [ section-30 ] ]    it has been found that there is a range of @xmath125 over which @xmath129 remains positive .",
    "we can call it as the physically admissible range .",
    "this range is related to the magnitude of the spin occuring in the theoretical model under consideration and to the resolution width . on the basis of the analysis ( presented in the * appendix * ) it is expected that even in the case of dynamics of mobile vortices and anti - vortices the physically admissible range would be larger for higher spin value and smaller for lower spin values .",
    "[ [ section-31 ] ]    another way to avoid the negativity is to assume , @xmath131 outside the physically admissible range @xcite .",
    "if this physically admissible range is within the range of experimental interest then the assumption is not applicable . in our case of spin - half ferromagnet",
    "the physically admissible range is well within the range of @xmath125 over which the neutron scattering data has been taken in the experiment ( as seen from figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "[ [ section-32 ] ]    hence , the negative values of @xmath129 can only be due to the use of the semi - classical like treatment to extend the classical theory of dynamics of mobile vortices and anti - vortices to a quasi two dimensional spin @xmath0 ferromagnet ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "[ [ section-33 ] ]    moreover , the convoluted out - of - plane dynamical structure function computed from our semi - classical like treatment , becomes negative within the experimentally imposed resolution width itself .",
    "thus the central peak occurring in this case may not posses a well defined width .",
    "[ [ section-34 ] ]    the agreement between the behaviour of dynamical structure functions obtained from our theoretical calculations and that from the experiment , in terms of the peak position and the overall shape , is found to be fairly good at temperatures much larger than @xmath9 .

    "has been developed @xcite .",
    "an extension of this formalism to the case of mobile spin vortices and anti - vortices is crucial for the quantum mechanical calculation of dynamical structure function .",

    "this prescription however , ca nt be taken into consideration when comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results , if the energy range of experimental interest contains the above mentioned range of @xmath125 .",
    "another way to avoid the negative values of @xmath132 is to decrease the value of @xmath67 [ see ( 25 ) ] , where @xmath67 is related to the experimental resolution width ( @xmath143 ) by the relation , @xmath144 @xmath130 being in energy units .",
    "decrease in @xmath67 means increase in the value of @xmath130 which signifies a poor experimental resolution width . in comparing the theoretical predictions with the experimental results , @xmath67",
    "is determined by the relation ( 26 ) , where @xmath143 is fixed from the experiment .",
    "another interesting feature of ( 25 ) is the fact that the region of @xmath125 where @xmath132 remains positive , depends on the spin value s via the relation , @xmath145 + \\frac{4\\pi}{t_{m}}).\\ ] ] this shows that when @xmath67 is fixed from the experimental resolution width , s remains as the free parameter to determine the range of @xmath125 as mentioned in ( 25 ) .",
    "increase in s will increase the range of @xmath125 where @xmath132 remains positive .",
    "hence for a system with high spin value s , the range of positive @xmath132 may actually be at par with the energy range of experimental interest , unlike the case of spin @xmath0 .",
