    "note that the wang - landau method directly computes the density of states , and the temperature comes into physical quantities in a way very different from the heat - bath ( + over - relaxation ) method .",

    "in this section , we explain some of the basic properties of the @xmath61 vortex , together with the way how we identify the spatial position of the @xmath61 vortex ( more precisely , the position of its core ) in our simulations .",

    "the triangular lattice consists of three interpenetrating triangular sublattices , and one might take an elementary plaquette a minimum upward triangle consisting of the three sublattice sites . at low temperatures ,",

    "the 120-degrees structure on an elementary plaquette would exhibit a uniform arrangement on each sublattice a , b and c. in view of this , we assign our local ` frame ' to an elementary plaquette on one of these three sublattices , say , on a , and identify an elementary @xmath61 vortex for every minimum triangular loop consisting of three such plaquettes of the sublattice a. while the true spin structure generally deviates from the @xmath5 structure , this deviation hardly affects the definition of the @xmath61 vorticity since only the topological character matters in the definition . in computing the spatial distribution of the @xmath61 vortices in the following section",

    "<S> as can be seen from fig.2(b ) , the nematic order or the spin coplanarity sets in almost simultaneously with the first - order transition for the case of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> additional step - wise structures of the data are due to the jump in the @xmath34-value associated with the incommensurability effect in finite systems under periodic bc mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> this onset of the nematic sro occurs at a temperature significantly lower than that of the undistorted model : see the inset </S>",
    "<S> .    establishing the existence of a first - order transition , we further examine what is responsible for this transition . for this purpose , we study the behavior of two types of topological excitations inherent to the model . </S>",
    "<S> one is a _ chiral - domain wall _ , and the other is a _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 vortex_.    the chiral domain wall is a wall - like excitation , which might be obtained by connecting the reversal points of the vector chirality . </S>",
    "<S> it is a zero - mode arising from the coplanar nature of the low-@xmath49 spin state . in the present distorted model , </S>",
    "<S> the chiral wall becomes a zero - mode only for a straight - line wall of system size @xmath24 running perpendicular to the @xmath12-bond direction , in sharp contrast to the undistorted case where chiral walls of various sizes and shapes are possible including closed loops . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(a ) exhibits the temperature dependence of the total number density of chiral walls . </S>",
    "<S> here we assign the vector chirality at each nearest - neighbor bond ( @xmath62 ) along the @xmath12-bond direction as @xmath63 , and suppose that a lattice site @xmath64 is included in the chiral wall when the condition @xmath65 is met . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature is lowered across @xmath35 , the number of chiral walls diminishes rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> typical snapshots of the chiral wall configurations are given in the online supplemental material @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study the behavior of another topological excitation , @xmath61 vortex @xcite , a point defect inherent to the frustrated 2d heisenberg model with the noncollinear spin order @xcite . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two different bc : one is the fixed bc where we fix the boundary spins so that they match the expected ground - state spin configuration of an incommensurate spiral lying on the ( @xmath66 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> the other is the `` vortex '' bc where the boundary spins are fixed in the manner to accommodate a single vortex on top of the fixed - bc spin configuration , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a spin rotation of @xmath67 around the @xmath68-axis is applied to the boundary spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the energy difference @xmath52 between the total energies of the fixed and the vortex bc , together with the total free - energy difference @xmath53 evaluated by integrating @xmath52 with respect to @xmath49 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(b ) exhibits @xmath52 calculated in this way . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp peak is observed just at @xmath35 , indicating that a strong anomaly occurs at @xmath35 in the vortex sector . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated free - energy difference @xmath53 is shown in the inset , which indicates that the vortex tends to stiffen below @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the transition turns out to accompany a significant change in the state of topological excitations , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , accompany a proliferation ( or a rapid increase in number ) of both chiral walls and @xmath61 vortices . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as demonstrated in the online supplemental material @xcite , there is an effective _ attractive _ interaction acting between the chiral domain walls and the @xmath61 vortices , which might cause a cooperative thermal generation of these topological excitations possibly leading to the observed first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61-vortex transition often becomes of first order when it accompanies a simultaneous symmetry - breaking of other degrees of freedom @xcite .    ) </S>",
    "<S> plane . </S>",
    "<S> the undistorted model corresponds to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover line is conventionally drawn at a point where @xmath54 for @xmath69 is equal to 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of the transition line near the undistorted limit is presently not clearly determined . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    we have performed similar simulations for other values of @xmath15 , and the resulting phase diagram is given in fig.4 in the distortion @xmath14 vs. the temperature @xmath49 plane . </S>",
    "<S> together with the first - order transition line @xmath70 , the crossover line associated with the onset of the nematic order is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this crossover line coincides with the first - order transition line for @xmath71 , while it is separated from the @xmath35-line for @xmath72 , lying well above it . for smaller @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> , we can not identify the transition directly . </S>",
    "<S> this is either the transition itself is absent for smaller @xmath14 , or @xmath35 becomes so low that we simply can not observe it in our simulations . in the range @xmath74 , @xmath35 varies almost linearly with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> linear extrapolation yields a critical value @xmath75 below which we no longer have a finite-@xmath49 transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difficulty to get reliable data at low temperatures in this small @xmath14 region hampers us to reliable determine the fate of the transition line in the @xmath50 limit , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , whether i ) it hits the @xmath44 axis at @xmath76 , or ii ) shows a nonlinear behavior in the smaller @xmath14 region reaching the @xmath44 axis only at @xmath20 , or iii ) ends at a finite @xmath49 exhibiting a critical end point at ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the possible relation of the finite-@xmath49 transition observed in our simulation to the zero - field transition of volborthite . </S>",
    "<S> the curie temperature of the present model is estimated to be @xmath79 for @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> if one matches it with the corresponding experimental value of volborthite @xmath80k @xcite , @xmath35 is estimated to be @xmath81k , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the experimental value , 1k . </S>",
    "<S> several possible causes for this discrepancy are conceivable : i ) the experimental value of the distortion @xmath14 is largely unknown which could explain at least a part of the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) volborthite is a @xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> quantum effect neglected here might give significant correction . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) real material is 3d . </S>",
    "<S> weak interplane coupling neglected here might push up the @xmath35-value significantly . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction neglected here might change the ordering behavior significantly . </S>",
    "<S> further studies are then required to clarify the true relation between the transition found here and the experimental one . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the ordering of the classical heisenberg af on a distorted kagome lattice by mc simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the model exhibits a thermodynamic first - order transition at an extremely low but finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> cooperative generation of the chiral domain walls and the @xmath61 vortices might be responsible for this first - order transition .    </S>",
