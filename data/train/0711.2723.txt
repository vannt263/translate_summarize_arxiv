    "inside the cell , proteins are synthesized as linear chains of amino acids , which fold into unique three - dimensional structures ( ` native states ' ) .",
    "the wide range of biochemical functions performed by the proteins are specified by their detailed structures . despite the large degrees of freedom ,",
    "surprisingly , proteins fold into their native states in a very short time , which is known as levinthal s paradox  @xcite .",
    "although , given suitable conditions , some small proteins can reach their native state in a single concerted step , many others fold in stages with initial conformational events long before the final ( ` native ' ) structure appears  @xcite .",
    "structural changes and chemical interactions occur throughout the entire folding process , and strongly cooperative mechanisms are necessary to bring the protein in its native conformation within a very short time period  @xcite .",
    "the fast folding is a result of the catalytic effect of the formation of clusters of residues in contact with each other , which have high preferences for the early formation of secondary structures ( helices , sheets , and loops ) in the presence of significant amounts of long - range tertiary structure interactions  @xcite .    the folding mechanism , kinetics , structure and function of proteins are intimately related to each other .",
    "misfolding of proteins into non - native structures can lead to several disorders  @xcite . correlating sequence with structure , as well as understanding of folding kinetics",
    "has been an area of intense activity for experimentalists and theoreticians  @xcite . among the different theoretical approaches used for studying protein structure , function , and folding kinetics ,",
    "the graph theoretical approach , based on perspectives from complex networks , has been used recently to study protein structures  @xcite .",
    "it is known that folding mechanisms are largely determined by a protein s topology rather than its inter - atomic interactions  @xcite . with that understanding , we build graph - theoretical models of protein structures to investigate various topological properties at two different length scales , and study their possible role in the kinetics of the protein folding .",
    "we use a coarse - grained complex network model of a protein structure , viz .",
    "the protein contact network ( pcn ) , by ignoring the fine - grained atomic - level details , and model the three dimensional structure as a system constituted of amino acid units , put in place by noncovalent interactions .",
    "long - range interactions are known to play a distinct role in determining the tertiary structure of the proteins  @xcite , as opposed to the short - range interactions , which could largely contribute to the secondary structure formations .",
    "we consider the long - range interaction network ( lin ) of each protein , which are subsets of the corresponding pcns , constructed by ignoring the short - range interactions .",
    "the idea behind studying lins is to understand the contribution of the long - range interactions to the topological properties , and their correlation to a biophysically relevant property , viz .",
    "rate of protein folding .",
    "this study aims to address the question  can general network parameters , derived from native - state structures of proteins , uncover features about the relationship of the structural properties to the folding kinetics of the proteins ? to study this we choose single domain , two - state folding proteins that belong to different structural classes  @xcite for which the kinetic parameter of rate of folding , ( @xmath1 ) is available .",
    "our analysis of the coarse - grained network representations of protein structures uncover the exceptional topological property of a high degree of assortative mixing at both length scales ( pcn and lin ) in these naturally - occurring , evolutionarily selected , biological networks .",
    "assortative mixing in lins indicates that this feature in pcns is independent of short - range interactions .",
    "the coefficient of assortativity  @xcite , a measure of assortative mixing , are also found to be considerably high for both pcns and lins . by constructing appropriate control networks",
    ", we further demonstrate that the degree ( connectivity ) distribution of the pcns alone can partially account for the presence of assortativity in these networks .",
    "to enumerate the contribution of these global parameters obtained from the coarse - grained network model of protein structures to their biophysical properties , we show that the coefficient of assortativity of pcns and lins tend to have positive correlation with the experimentally determined rate of folding of these proteins .",
    "this implies that assortative mixing , that tends to connect highly - connected residues to other residues with many contacts , may assist in speeding up of the folding process .",
    "in contrast , the average clustering coefficients of lins show a good negative correlation with the rate of folding , indicating that clustering of amino acids , that participate in long - range interactions , into cliques , slows down the folding process .",
    "interestingly , the average clustering coefficients of pcns show negligible correlation , thereby implying that the short range interactions can reduce the negative effect on their folding kinetics .    three parameters co ( contact order )  @xcite , lro ( long range order )  @xcite , and tcd ( total contact distance )  @xcite based on sequence distance per contact and/or total number of contacts per residue of the proteins , have also been shown to have negative correlation to their rate of folding  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of prediction of the rate of folding , with parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , remain unchanged if short - range interactions are not included in the calculation . here ,",
    "along with delineating the role of long - range interactions , we have attempted to show that general network parameters , such as , clustering coefficient and assortativity , that are widely - used in networks of diverse origins ( technological , biological and social ) , can not only give an insight into their structural properties , but can also be used as indicators of specific biophysical processes , such as , of protein folding .",

    "the result implies that , along with showing assortative mixing , the pcns and their lins both show significant positive correlations with the rate of folding .",
    "thus , the generic property of assortative mixing in proteins tends to contribute positively towards their kinetics of folding , and is fairly independent of the short- and long - range of interactions . here",
    "also the type i random controls , due to their coefficient of assortativity being clustered around zero ( fig .",

    "our aim is to understand if the general network parameters can offer any clue to the biophysical properties of the existing three dimensional structure of a protein , thereby reflecting the commonalities in network organization in general .",
    "our coarse - grained complex network model of protein structures uncovers , for the first time in a naturally evolved biological system , the interesting , and exceptional topological feature of assortativity at both short and long length scale of contacts .",
    "the assortative nature is found to be a generic feature of protein structures .",
    "we show that the assortativity positively correlates to the folding mechanisms at both length scale .",
    "this feature corroborates the known fact that the folding mechanisms are largely independent of the finer details of the protein structure  @xcite .",
    "since strongly cooperative mechanisms are necessary to bring the protein in its native conformation within a very short time  @xcite , we have shown that assortative mixing contributes positively towards speeding up the folding process at different contact - length scales .",
    "the generality of assortative mixing in pcns assume greater importance in the light of the debate on whether protein folding kinetics is under evolutionary control  @xcite .",
    "given the genetic basis and mode of formation of protein chains , the signature of assortativity as an indicator to the rate of folding is clear .",
    "we also delineate the difference in the property of clustering of the nodes in the native structure at short and long length scales .",
    "the pcns have high degree of clustering , which contributes to their ` small - world ' nature helping in efficient and effective dissipation of energy needed in their function  @xcite .",
    "our results show that , in contrast , the corresponding lins have significantly lower and distributed clustering coefficients  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc01 ] ) , and they show a negative correlation with the rate of folding of the proteins  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lnkr_c01 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that clustering of amino acids that participate in the long - range interactions , into ` cliques ' can slow down the folding process - possibly due to the backbone connectivity and steric factors .",
    "however , the clustering coefficient of pcns _ do not _ have any significant correlation to the rate of folding , clearly indicating that the short - range interactions may be playing a constructive and active role in the determination of the rate of the folding process by reducing the negative contribution of the lins .",
    "our results thus show that the separation of the types of contacts in the pcns and lins clearly delineate the length scale of contacts that play crucial role in protein folding .",
    "it was recently shown that the @xmath83 of the transition state ensemble ( @xmath89 ) is highly correlated to that of their native state structure , and they both correlate equally well with their rate of folding  @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the fact that the long - range contacts are mainly located in the structural core that are formed early in the folding process , and the formation of such contact networks leads to the inverse correlation with the folding rates .",
    "our results with general parameters of the long - range interaction networks ( @xmath55 and @xmath90 ) corresponding to the native pcns also reflect the crucial role that long - range interactions play in their rate of folding .    after the synthesis in the cell , folding of the amino acid chain is important for attaining the structure required to reach a functional state as soon as possible .",
    "this happens through inter - residue non - covalent interactions at many length and time scales .",
    "the folded structure have to confer stability , regions for binding of ligands of specific shapes and sizes , transmit the information of binding / unbinding to other parts of the protein , scaffold for retaining the functional regions along with the shape suitable for the protein function .",
    "it is likely that many of these properties may require opposing features to operate at different time and space scales .",
    "for example , the ` small - world ' nature ( high clustering ) in the native protein structure is useful in inter - residue signalling required for its function on binding and allostery . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - range interaction network have reduced clustering , which may facilitate communication among distant residues in the native structure to some extent , but such a feature can also increase the folding time as it requires distant residues in the chain to come closer during the folding process .",
    "thus , the evolved native structure of the proteins show differential levels of clustering at two length scales .",
    "the assortative mixing , on the other hand , helps in enhancing the folding process at both length scales .",
    "a large number of networks of diverse origin have been found  @xcite to be of disassortative nature , and questions regarding the origin of this property and whether this is an universal property of complex networks , has been adjudged as `` one of the ten leading questions for network research ''  @xcite .",
    "our discovery of assortativity in the amino acid networks in protein structures at short and long contact scales questions the invoked generality of the property in natural networks .",
    "the assortative nature of the social networks has been claimed to be originating from their unusually high clustering coefficients and community structure  @xcite . in proteins ,",
    "lins have high assortativity without necessarily having high clustering coefficients .",
    "it would be interesting to study if the secondary structures provide any role in shaping the `` community structure '' in these molecular networks that help in conferring assortative mixing at both contact length scales  @xcite .",
    "disassortative mixing observed in certain biological networks ( metabolic signaling pathways network , and gene regulatory network ) is conjectured to be responsible for decreasing the likelihood of crosstalk between different functional modules of the cell , and increasing the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these two networks , pcns are not disassortative . for the pcn , one may put forward the possibility of the backbone chain connectivity as a means of conferring greater robustness against perturbations .    from computational studies ,",
    "it has been observed  @xcite that assortative networks percolate easily , i.e. , information gets easily transferred through the network as compared to that in disassortative networks .",
    "protein folding is a cooperative phenomenon , and hence , communication amongst nodes is essential , so that appropriate noncovalent interactions can take place to form the stable native state structure  @xcite .",
    "thus percolation of information is very much essential and could lead to the observed cooperativity and fast folding of the proteins .",
    "hence assortative mixing observed in proteins could be an essential prerequisite for facilitating folding of proteins .",

    "<S> starting from linear chains of amino acids , the spontaneous folding of proteins into their elaborate three - dimensional structures is one of the remarkable examples of biological self - organization . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated native state structures of @xmath0 single - domain , two - state proteins , from complex networks perspective , to understand the role of topological parameters in proteins folding kinetics , at two length scales - as `` protein contact networks ( pcns ) '' and their corresponding `` long - range interaction networks ( lins ) '' constructed by ignoring the short - range interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , both pcns and lins exhibit the exceptional topological property of `` assortative mixing '' that is absent in all other biological and technological networks studied so far . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the degree distribution of these contact networks is partly responsible for the observed assortativity . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of assortativity also shows a positive correlation with the rate of protein folding at both short and long contact scale , whereas , the clustering coefficients of only the lins exhibit a negative correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the general topological parameters of these naturally - evolved protein networks can effectively represent the structural and functional properties required for fast information transfer among the residues facilitating biochemical / kinetic functions , such as , allostery , stability , and the rate of folding .    * supplementary information : * supplementary data are available at _ bioinformatics _ online . </S>"
