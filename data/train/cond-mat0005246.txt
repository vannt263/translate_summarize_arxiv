    "neutron specular reflection has become a common tool in materials sciences @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are still severe difficulties in the interpretation of reflectometer experiments because of the so - called _ phase problem_. this problem refers to the incompleteness of the data obtained in standard experiments in structure physics @xcite where only the intensities of the reflected waves are measured but not the corresponding phases . in specular reflection both the modulus and the phase of the reflection coefficient are needed for an unambiguous reconstruction of the surface profiles @xcite .",
    "several solutions of this so - called _ phase problem _ have been proposed for neutron specular reflection @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed reference layer methods based on polarization measurements @xcite are of particular interest because they also work in the total reflection regime and allow the unique reconstruction of surface profiles of magnetic samples . despite the great effort in theory and modelling ,",
    "only the phase determination by the method of majkrzak and berk @xcite was tested experimentally @xcite for a specific case .",
    "the available methods of phase determination [ e.g. @xcite ] for non - absorptive as well as for absorptive samples provide us with the full ( modulus and phase ) reflection coefficient @xmath0 for positive values of the wave number @xmath1 perpendicular to the surface of the sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the reconstruction of the surface profiles by inversion requires the knowledge of @xmath0 over the positive _ and _ negative range of @xmath1-values .",
    "this is no problem for non - absorptive samples because in this case the reflection coefficient @xmath0 satisfies @xmath2 and @xmath0 at negative @xmath1-values is directly given in terms of @xmath0 at positive @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the presence of absorption relation ( [ unitary ] ) does not hold , and therefore a reconstruction of the surface profiles is not possible without further input . to our knowledge , so far no procedure has been proposed for providing the missing information .    in this work",
    "we propose a modification of the reference layer method for non - magnetic samples based on polarization measurements @xcite .",
    "the modification consists in the interchange of the positions of the sample and the reference layer , which allows the determination of the reflection coefficient for positive and negative @xmath1-values .",
    "the method works also in the total reflection regime ( in contrast to @xcite ) ; it is only limited by the sample thickness because of the corresponding kiessig oscillations which must be resolved .    in section",
    "ii we present the method and derive the basic relations for the phase determination .",
    "a realistic example is given in section iii , where we demonstrate by simulations the feasibility of the method .",
    "the problem of thick samples is also discussed . a brief summary and concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we consider the arrangement of an unknown non - magnetic sample and a magnetic reference layer mounted on a substrate ( e.g. a si - wafer ) as shown in fig .",
    "we assume that within the reference layer ( @xmath3 ) there is a magnetic field @xmath4 aligned with the surface of the sample .",
    "the direction of this field is taken as the @xmath5-axis , which is chosen as the axis of spin quantization .",
    "the direction of propagation perpendicular to the surface defines the @xmath6-axis in a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "such a magnetic reference layer may consist of a ferromagnetic stratum , e.g. a fe- , co- or ni - layer ( cf .",
    "we assume that the sample as well as the substrate are field - free .",
    "however , the further considerations remain still valid as long as the condition @xmath7 for @xmath8 is satisfied .    the arrangement of fig .",
    "1 differs from that of @xcite only by the interchange of sample and reference layer and therefore we can make use of the same relationships for the description of the reflection .",
    "the position of the sample on top of the reference layer and the substrate , however , leads to a completely new situation as compared to previous proposals for the solution of the phase problem .",
    "this is easily seen from the expression for the reflection coefficient @xmath9 of the whole arrangement @xmath10 here the reflection properties of the sample enter in terms of the reflection coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the quantity @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the transmission coefficients of the sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the reflection coefficient of the reference layer plus the substrate and the indices @xmath16 refer to incidence from left and right , respectively . because of the rather intricate dependence of @xmath17 on the reflection properties of the sample the separation of its unknown reflection coefficient becomes more involved .",
    "following the procedure of @xcite we introduce the quantity @xmath18 which can be expressed in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the polarizations of the reflected and the incident beam , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath22 refer to neutron beams polarized parallel @xmath23 and antiparallel @xmath24 to the magnetic field .",
    "all quantities on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) are measurable and therefore @xmath25 can be determined experimentally .",
    "use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : super ] ) for @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdef ] ) leads after simple algebraics to the relation @xmath27 the term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rn ] ) is equal to @xmath28 , i.e. to the right reflection coefficient at negative @xmath1-values ( cf .",
    "this is easily seen from the jost solutions of the bare sample . making use of the linear independence of the jost solutions",
    "@xmath29 with asymptotic forms @xmath30/t_l(q ) \\\\ e^{iqx } \\end{array }   \\right .",
    "\\begin{array}{l }   \\mbox{for } x \\to -\\infty \\\\\\mbox{for } x \\to + \\infty \\end{array } \\label{eq : jostl}\\ ] ] and @xmath31/t_r(q ) \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\begin{array}{l } \\mbox{for } x \\to -\\infty \\\\ \\mbox{for } x \\to + \\infty \\end{array } \\ , , \\label{eq : jostr}\\ ] ]",
    "one finds @xmath32 comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : fr ] ) in the limit @xmath8 with the corresponding asymptotic form ( [ eq : jostr ] ) with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath33 we obtain @xmath34 and therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rn ] ) . @xmath35",
    "this is a relation involving measurable quantities which expresses the right reflection coefficient at @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) in terms of its value at @xmath1 .    for a full determination of the reflection coefficient @xmath37 at positive and negative @xmath1-values ( i.e. for obtaining two independent equations for the two unknowns @xmath37 and @xmath28 ) at least two sets of measurements with different reference layers are necessary . denoting the two measurements with the upper indices @xmath38 and @xmath39 one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmn ] ) the quadratic equation for @xmath37 @xmath40 with @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 the quadratic equation ( [ eq : quadr ] ) has two roots @xmath44 similarly to the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite the physical solution @xmath37 can be selected either by continuity requiring that the phase @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 or by the condition @xmath47 .",
    "the latter may fail at some @xmath1-values and must be accompanied by continuity in certain momentum regions .",
    "the selection by continuity implies measurements of @xmath25 over the whole range of momenta .",
    "the solution @xmath28 at negative @xmath1-values is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmn ] ) .",
    "we note that the method relies solely on measurements of the polarization of the reflected beam .",
    "in particular , even for absorptive samples , no transmission measurements are needed for the determination of @xmath48 as might be conjectured from the general formalism @xcite .",
    "we test the method by a simulation using the realistic example shown in fig .",
    "1 . the sample consists of a @xmath49  nm au- and a @xmath50  nm cd - layer , where the latter is strongly absorptive . to determine the reflection coefficient for positive and negative @xmath1-values we consider measurements with two different reference layers .",
    "both reference layers are composed of a @xmath51  nm cr - layer and a @xmath51  nm thick film of ferromagnetic material magnetizied up to saturation and mounted on a si - wafer .",
    "the required difference in the reflection properties of the reference layers can be achieved by using fe in measurement ( a ) and co in measurement ( b ) for the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "the magnetization of this layer will generate a magnetic induction also outside the ferromagnetic film which we assume , however , to be small enough not to affect the neutron beam .",
    "for simplicity we set it equal to zero .",
    "the reflectivity @xmath52 and the polarization components @xmath53 for the arrangement of fig .",
    "1 have been calculated for both reference layers at all positive @xmath1-values . to illustrate the typical observables which have to be measured for the phase determination we show in fig .",
    "2 the reflectivity @xmath54 and the components of the polarization @xmath53 for the reference layer ( a ) assuming a fully polarized incident beam in @xmath6-direction .",
    "it is evident that in the given example measurements in the range @xmath55  nm@xmath56 are certainly feasible . following the procedure outlined in section ii we obtain two solutions for @xmath37 which are displayed in fig .",
    "3 . as expected , in a wide range of positive @xmath1-values only one solution satisfies @xmath57 and is therefore physically admissible . applying continuity the region of uniqueness",
    "can be extended over all positive @xmath1-values .",
    "in addition one obtains via eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmn ] ) unique values of @xmath28 .",
    "hence the measurements of the polarization at positive @xmath1-values is sufficient for the determination of the complete reflection coefficient on the whole @xmath1-axis . to extract the surface profiles from the extracted reflection coefficients",
    "@xmath37 we apply the marchenko inversion procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown to yield correct reconstructions of the _ complex _ input potential , although a rigorous mathematical proof of this is lacking .",
    "the marchenko inversion procedure is usually formulated for @xmath58 , while our procedure provides @xmath37 . because of the specific choice of our coordinate system we can also use @xmath37 in the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite but we have to change the argument of the evaluated potential from @xmath6 to @xmath59 . this procedure has been applied to analyse the numerically extracted values of @xmath37 . the results for the scattering length density profile are displayed in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the method reproduces the original potential within the resolution determined by the maximum available @xmath1-value .",
    "since the method is strongly related to the reference layer method presented previously @xcite its stability with respect to experimental uncertainties , e.g. roughness of interfaces and measurement errors , is similar to that of method @xcite .",
    "this is also true for the reconstruction of the surface profiles . for more details on the stability",
    "we refer to our previous studies ( cf .",
    "we have proposed a method involving a magnetic reference layer which , for the first time , allows the determination of the full complex reflection coefficient at positive and negative @xmath1-values .",
    "thus a reconstruction of surface profiles of absorptive non - magnetic samples becomes feasible .",
    "the novel procedure is a modification of the previously proposed method @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the interchange of the position of the sample and the reference layer . because of this change the reflection properties of the sample enter in a more involved way and require two sets of measurements using two different reference layers .",
    "the additional effort is remunerated by providing us with an additional relationship from which the reflection coefficient at negative @xmath1-values can be obtained .",
    "this novel feature allows the determination of absorptive surface profiles by inversion ,  an open problem up to now .",
    "in a numerical example it is demonstrated that the reconstruction of real and imaginary parts of the scattering density profiles is feasible .    as in the previously proposed reference layer methods @xcite",
    "the thickness of the layers is reflected in the @xmath1-dependence of the measured data .",
    "specifically , the so - called kiessig oscillations must be resolved in experiment .",
    "hence , the degree of the monochromaticity as well as the resolution of the diffraction angle of the incident beam set a limit on the thickness of the studied system .",
    "the roughness of the interfaces has similar effects and results in additional uncertainties in the deduced reflection coefficient ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in summary",
    "the phase problem of neutron reflection has been solved for absorptive non - magnetic samples .",
    "the method seems experimentally feasible for sample thicknesses up to @xmath60  nm and complements the reference layer methods @xcite recently presented .",
