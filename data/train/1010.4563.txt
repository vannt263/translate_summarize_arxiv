    "this paper is the third installment in a series @xcite which devote to developing absolutely stable discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods for the following prototypical helmholtz problem with large wave number : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the imaginary unit .",
    "@xmath2 is a given positive ( large ) number and known as the wave number .",
    "is the so - called first order absorbing boundary condition @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xcite focused on designing and analyzing @xmath3- and _ @xmath4-interior penalty discontinuous galerkin _ ( ipdg )",
    "methods which are absolutely stable ( with respect to wave number @xmath5 and mesh size @xmath3 ) and optimally convergent ( with respect to @xmath3 ) .",
    "the main ideas of @xcite are to introduce some novel interior penalty terms in the sesquilinear forms of the proposed ipdg methods and to use a non - standard analytical tool , which is based on a rellich identity technique , to prove the desired stability and error estimates .",
    "the numerical experiment results shown that the absolutely stable ipdg methods significantly outperform the standard finite element and finite difference methods , which are known only to be stable under stringent mesh constraints @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , for the helmholtz problem .",
    "moreover , the numerical experiment results also shown that these ipdg methods are capable to correctly track the phases of the highly oscillatory waves even when the mesh violates the  rule - of - thumb \" condition ( i.e. , @xmath8 grid points must be used in a wave length ) .",
    "the main difficulty of analyzing the helmholtz type problems is caused by the strong indefiniteness of the helmholtz equation which in turn makes it hard to establish stability estimates for its numerical approximations . the loss of stability in the case of large wave numbers results in an additional pollution error ( besides the interpolation error ) in the global error bounds .",
    "extensive research has been done to address the question whether it is possible to reduce the pollution effect , we refer the reader to chapter 4 of @xcite and the references therein for an detailed exposition in this direction .",
    "motivated by the success of @xcite , the primary objective of this paper is to extend the work of @xcite to the _ local discontinuous galerkin _ ( ldg ) formulation , which is known to be more  physical \" and flexible than the ipdg formulation on designing dg schemes @xcite . as it is well - known now , the key step for constructing ldg methods is to design the numerical fluxes .",
    "as soon as the numerical fluxes are selected , for a large class of coercive elliptic and parabolic second order problems , there is a general framework for carrying out convergence analysis of ldg methods @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this general framework does not apply to the helmholtz type problems which is extremely noncoercive / indefinite for large wave number @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , when designing the numerical fluxes for our ldg methods , we borrow the idea of @xcite by establishing the connection between our ldg methods and the ipdg methods of @xcite although it turns out that the ipdg methods of @xcite do not have exactly equivalent ldg formulations due to the non - standard penalty terms used in @xcite .",
    "this then leads to the construction of our first ldg method .",
    "it is proved and numerically verified that this ldg method is absolutely stable and optimally convergent for the scalar variable .",
    "however , it is sub - optimal for the vector / flux variable . to improve the approximation accuracy for the vector / flux variable",
    ", we design another set of numerical fluxes which result in the construction of our second ldg method .",
    "it is proved that the second ldg method is also absolutely stable and gives a better approximation for the vector / flux variable than the first method . on the other hand , it is computationally more expensive than the first ldg method , which is expected .    to analyze the proposed ldg methods , we take an opposite approach to that advocated in @xcite , that is , instead of converting ldg methods to their  equivalent \" ipdg methods in the primal form , we recast and treat our ldg methods as nonconforming mixed finite element methods . to avoid using the standard techniques such as schatz argument ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or babuka s _ inf - sup _ condition argument @xcite to derive error estimates ( and to prove stability ) , both approaches would certainly lead to stringent mesh constraints , our main idea is to establish a _ generalized inf - sup _ condition , which holds without any mesh constraint , for each ldg method .",
    "the generalized _ inf - sup _",
    "conditions then immediately infer the desired absolute stability of the proposed ldg methods . in return",
    ", the stability results not only guarantee the well - posedness of the ldg methods but also play a crucial role in the derivation of the ( optimal ) error estimates .",
    "it should be pointed out that a lot of work has recently been done on developing dg methods using piecewise plane wave functions , oppose to simpler piecewise polynomial functions as done in this paper , for the helmholtz type problems .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , none of these plane wave dg method is proved to be absolutely stable with respect to wave number @xmath5 and mesh size @xmath3 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for more discussions in this direction .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for more discussions and references on other discretization techniques for the helmholtz type problems .",
    "this paper consists of four additional sections . in section [ sec-2 ] , we introduce the notations used in this paper and present the derivations of our two ldg methods . in section [ sec-3 ] , we present a detailed stability analysis for both ldg methods . the main task of the section",
    "is to prove a _ generalized inf - sup _",
    "condition for each proposed ldg method .",
    "similar to @xcite , a nonorthodox test function trick is the key to get the job done . in section [ sec-4 ] , a non - standard two - step error estimate procedure is used to derive error estimates for the proposed ldg methods . once again , the stability estimates established in section [ sec-3 ] play a crucial role .",
    "finally , section [ sec-5 ] contains some numerical experiments which are designed to verify the theoretical error bounds proved in section [ sec-4 ] and to compare the performance of the proposed two ldg methods .",
    "the standard space , norm and inner product notation are adopted in this paper .",
    "their definitions can be found in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 denote the @xmath12-inner product on _ complex - valued _ @xmath13 and @xmath14 spaces , respectively . @xmath15 and @xmath16 . throughout the paper , @xmath17 is used to denote a generic positive constant which is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also use the shorthand notation @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the inequality @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is a shorthand notation for the statement @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "assume that @xmath24 is a bounded and _ strictly star - shaped _",
    "domain with respect to a point @xmath25 .",
    "we now recall the definition of star - shaped domains .",
    "[ def1 ] @xmath26 is said to be a _ star - shaped _",
    "domain with respect to @xmath27 if there exists a nonnegative constant @xmath28 such that @xmath29 @xmath26 is said to be _ strictly star - shaped _",
    "if @xmath28 is positive .    let @xmath30 be a family of partitions of @xmath31 parameterized by @xmath32 .",
    "for any triangle / tetrahedron @xmath33 , we define @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ". similarly , for each edge / face @xmath36 of @xmath33 , define @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the elements of @xmath30 satisfy the minimal angle condition .",
    "we also define @xmath38 let @xmath36 be an interior edge shared by two elements @xmath39 and @xmath40 whose unit outward normal vectors are denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for a scalar function @xmath43 ,",
    "let @xmath44 , and define @xmath45 = v_k - v_{k^\\prime } , \\quad [ [ v ] ] = v_{1 } \\vec{n}_{1}+v_{2}\\vec{n}_{2 } \\quad \\text{on } e\\in { \\mathcal{e}}_h^i,\\ ] ] where k is @xmath39 or @xmath40 , whichever has the bigger global labeling and @xmath46 is the other . for a vector field @xmath47 , let @xmath48 and define @xmath49 = \\vec{v}_k-\\vec{v}_{k^{\\prime } } , \\quad [ [ \\vec{v}]]=\\vec{v}_1\\cdot \\vec{n}_1+\\vec{v}_2\\cdot \\vec{n}_{2 } \\quad \\text{on } e\\in { \\mathcal{e}}_h^i.\\ ] ]    as it is well - known now ( cf . @xcite ) that the first step for formulating an ldg method is to rewrite the given pde as a first order system by introducing an auxiliary variable . for the helmholtz problem  we have @xmath50 clearly , the vector - valued function ( often called the flux variable ) @xmath51 is the auxiliary variable .",
    "then , multiplying and by test functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , and integrating both equations over an element @xmath54 yields @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the unit outward normal vector to @xmath57 .",
    "the above equations form the weak formulation one uses to define ldg methods for the helmholtz problem .    next , we define ldg spaces as follows @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath60 on @xmath61",
    ".    finally , we are ready to define the following general ldg formulation : find @xmath62 such that for all @xmath63 there hold @xmath64 for any @xmath65 . where the quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are called numerical fluxes , are respectively approximations to @xmath68 and @xmath69 on the boundary @xmath57 of @xmath61 . as it is well - known now that the most important issue for all ldg methods is how to choose the numerical fluxes .",
    "the different choices of the numerical fluxes obviously lead to different ldg methods .",
    "it is easy to understand that these numerical fluxes must be chosen carefully in order to ensure the stability and accuracy of the resulted ldg methods .    in this paper",
    ", we shall only consider the _ linear element _ case ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) and propose two sets of numerical fluxes @xmath71 , which lead to two ldg methods .",
    "our choices of numerical fluxes are inspired by the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods proposed by feng and wu @xcite and are identified with the help of the unified dg framework of @xcite which bridges the primal dg formulations ( e.g. ipdg methods ) and the flux dg formulations ( i.e. , ldg methods ) .    1 .",

    "setting @xmath82 in and subtracting the resulting equation from then leads to the following formulation : @xmath83where @xmath84,[[\\nabla_h v_h]]{\\right\\rangle}_e + \\beta { \\left\\langle}[[u_h]],[[v_h]]{\\right\\rangle}_e\\bigr ) \\\\ & \\qquad -\\sum_{e\\in { \\mathcal{e}}_h^i } \\bigl({\\left\\langle}[[u_h]],\\{\\nabla_h v_h\\}{\\right\\rangle}_e + { \\left\\langle}\\ { \\nabla_h u_h\\},[[v_h]]{\\right\\rangle}_e \\bigr ) . \\\\ f(v_h)&:= ( f , v_h)_{\\omega}+{\\left\\langle}g , v_h{\\right\\rangle}_{{\\gamma}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , is the corresponding primal ( i.e. , ipdg ) formulation of our ldg method # 1 . comparing with the ipdg formulation of @xcite , we see that all the interior penalty terms of also appear in the ipdg formulation of @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is exactly by reversing the order of the above derivation that leads to the discovery of the numerical fluxes of ldg method # 1 .",
    "from their constructions , it is easy to see that both ldg methods proposed in the previous section are consistent schemes for the helmholtz problem . for coercive elliptic ( and parabolic ) problems , the stability of such a numerical scheme can be proved easily as demonstrated in @xcite ( the same statement is true for their corresponding pde stability analysis ) .",
    "however , the helmholtz problem  is an indefinite problem and it becomes notoriously non - coercive for large wave number @xmath5 .",
    "deriving its stability estimates ( i.e. , a priori estimates of its pde solution ) , particularly wave - number - dependent estimates , has been proved not to be an easy job ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "numerically , such a quest has been known to be even harder because of the lower order of the smoothness and the inflexibility of ( piecewise ) approximation functions ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the stability of the numerical methods in all the above quoted references was proved under some very restrictive mesh constraints .",
    "an open question was then raised by zienkiewicz @xcite which asks whether it is possible to construct an absolutely stable ( and optimally convergent ) numerical method ( i.e. , no restriction on the mesh size @xmath3 and the wave number @xmath5 ) for the helmholtz equation .",
    "almost a decade later feng and wu @xcite were able to design for the first time such numerical methods , which happen to belong to the ipdg family , for the helmholtz problem .    the goal of this section is to show that in the case of the linear element ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) the ldg method # 1 and # 2 proposed in the previous section have the same stability property as the ipdg methods of @xcite do , that is , the ldg method # 1 and # 2 are absolutely stable for all mesh size @xmath32 and all wave number @xmath85 without imposing any constraint on them . to establish this result , unlike the approach used and advocated in the general framework of @xcite which converts an ldg method into its equivalent primal method and then analyzes the latter using the standard finite element galerkin techniques , we shall directly fit the ldg method # 1 and # 2 into the ( nonconforming ) mixed method framework as done in @xcite and adapting the mixed method techniques to prove the desired stability result .",
    "it is well - known that the key ingredient for the mixed method approach is to establish the _ inf - sup _ or babuka - brezzi condition for the ( augmented ) sesquilinear forms for each method .",
    "however , we are not able to prove such an _ inf - sup _ condition for either method without imposing mesh constraints ( which we believe is not possible ) . to overcome the difficulty , our main idea is to prove a generalized ( and weaker ) _ inf - sup _ condition which holds for all @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out that this generalized _ inf - sup _ condition is sufficient for us to establish the desired absolute stability for the ldg method # 1 and # 2 . to prove the generalized _",
    "inf - sup _ condition , the key technique we use is a special test function technique which was first introduced and developed in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to show that the sesquilinear form @xmath89 defined in satisfies a generalized _ inf - sup _ condition , which will play a vital role for us to establish the absolute stability of the ldg method # 1 in the next subsection .",
