    "blazars , a common term used for flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacertae objects , are the most extreme types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in these objects",
    "the dominant radiation component originates in a relativistic jet pointed nearly towards the observer .",
    "the double - peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is attributed to a population of relativistic electrons spiraling in the magnetic field of the jet .",
    "the low energy peak is due to synchrotron emission and the second , high energy peak is attributed to inverse compton scattering of low energy photons in leptonic acceleration models .",
    "models based on the acceleration of hadrons can also sufficiently describe the observed seds and lightcurves @xcite . for most fsrqs and a large fraction of bl lacertae objects ( namely lbls ) the low energy peak",
    "is located in the energy range between submillimeter to optical . on the other hand , for most of the sources detected to emit vhe @xmath0-rays ( high frequency peaking bl lacs , hbls )",
    "the low energy peak is located at uv to x - rays energies @xcite .",
    "blazars show variable flux in all wavebands from radio to very high energy ( vhe defined as @xmath1 100 gev ) @xmath0-rays .",
    "the relationship between the variability at different wavebands appears rather complicated .",
    "the magic collaboration is performing target of opportunity observations of sources in a high flux state in the optical and/or x - ray band .",
    "the optically triggered observations have resulted in the discovery of vhe @xmath0-rays from mrk  180 @xcite and 1es  1011 + 496 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the results of observations of the bl lac object s5  0716 + 714 in november 2007 and april 2008 , the latter resulting in the discovery of vhe @xmath0-rays from the source as announced in @xcite .",
    "s5  0716 + 714 has been studied intensively at all frequency bands .",
    "it is highly variable with rapid variations observed from the radio to x - ray bands ( wagner et al .",
    "it has therefore been target to several multiwavelength campaigns , the most recent one organized by the glast - agile support program in july - november 2007 @xcite . due to the very bright nucleus , which outshines the host galaxy ,",
    "the redshift of s5  0716 + 714 is still uncertain .",
    "the recent detection of the host galaxy @xcite suggests a redshift of @xmath2 which is consistent with the redshift @xmath3 determined by spectroscopy for 3 galaxies close to the location of s5  0716 + 714 @xcite . in the sed of s5  0716 + 714",
    "the synchrotron peak in located in the optical band and is , therefore , classified either as lbl @xcite or as ibl @xcite    s5  0716 + 714 was detected several times at different flux levels by the egret detector on board the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite . also agile reported detection of a variable @xmath0-ray flux with peak flux density above the maximum reported from egret @xcite .",
    "observations at vhe @xmath0-ray energies by hegra resulted in an upper limit of f(@xmath4 photons/@xmath5/s @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the first detection of vhe @xmath0-rays from s5  0716 + 714 .",
    "it is the third optically triggered discovery of a new vhe @xmath0-ray emitting blazar by magic .",
    "we also present magic observations of the source in a low optical state , at which the observations resulted in a flux upper limit that is clearly lower than the observed vhe @xmath0-ray flux during the optical high state .",
    "the magic telescope is a stand alone imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope located on the canary island of la palma .",
    "magic has a standard trigger threshold of 60gev , an angular resolution of @xmath6 and an energy resolution above 150gev of @xmath7 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "tuorla blazar monitoring program @xcite ( http://users.utu.fi/kani/1m ) monitors s5  0716 + 714 on a nightly basis using the kva 35 cm telescope at la palma and the tuorla 1meter telescopes . at the end of october 2007 ( 22th )",
    "the optical flux had more than doubled ( from 19mjy to 42mjy ) in less than a month and magic was alerted . due to moon and weather constraints ,",
    "the magic observations started 11 days later , when the optical flux had already decreased significantly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "magic observed the source for 14 nights for a total of 16.8 hours . during some nights",
    "the observing conditions were rather poor and the affected data was rejected from the analysis .",
    "the observation time of the remaining good quality data amounts to 10.3 hours .",
    "the zenith angle range of these observations was 42 to 46 degrees .",
    "there was another strong optical flare from s5  0716 + 714 in april 2008 .",
    "the optical flux almost doubled within three nights ( 14th of april : 29 mjy , 17th april : 52 mjy ) , and at 17th of april reached its historical maximum value .",
    "magic started the observations 5 nights later , when the moon conditions allowed .",
    "the source was observed during 9 nights with zenith angles from 47 to 55 degrees for a total of 7.1 hours .",
    "unfortunately , during the last 6 nights of the observations there was strong calima ( sand from sahara desert ) in the atmosphere and this data was , therefore , rejected from the analysis .",
    "the observation time of the remaining data of this period amounts to 2.8 hours only .",
    "the total life time of s5  0716 + 714 magic observations in 2007 and 2008 after data quality cuts was 13.1 hours .",
    "in addition to r - band photometry we also made polarimetric observation of s5  0716 + 714 using the kva 60 cm telescope on 2008 , april 29 .",
    "the polarization was @xmath8 and the polarization angle @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite reported that between 2008 , april 19 and april 25 the positional angle of polarization rotated with an approximate rate 60 degrees per day and that after 2008 , april 26 it returned to the pre - outburst level . since we measured the polarization only during one night , we can not confirm this behaviour of the positional angle of polarization .",

    "a zoom into the magic 2008 data is shown in the inset of the upper panel to illustrate that there is no significant variability . ]",
    "the magic data was analyzed using the standard analysis chain as described in @xcite .",
    "background rejection is achieved by a cut in hadronness , which was optimized using crab nebula data taken under comparable conditions ( nsb noise , zenith distance , etc . ) .",
    "the cut in @xmath10alpha@xmath10 that defines the signal region was also optimized in the same way .",
    "an additional cut removed the events with a total charge of less than 200 photoelectrons ( phe ) in order to assure a better background rejection .",
    "for the given cuts and zenith angle range of the observations the analysis threshold corresponds to 400gev .",
    "the resulting @xmath10alpha@xmath10 distribution after all cuts for the overall s5  0716 + 714 data sample in 2007  2008 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] . an overall excess of 252 @xmath0-like events over 1548 background events corresponding to a significance of @xmath12 was found .",
    "most of the signal comes from the 2008 data sample : the analysis of the 2008 data only results in 176 excess events over 422 background events corresponding to @xmath13 . from the 2007 data alone an excess corresponding to @xmath14",
    "was found .",

    "no significant variability is seen on time scales shorter than 6 months .",
    "however , we note that due to the observation windows and available data , we are not sensitive to week or months variability time scales . no intranight variability was detected either but given the low significance of the individual magic points , an intranight variability by a factor of at least ten would have been required to detect it . in the optical band , instead , a clear variability on time scales from days to months is visible with two distinct flares : the first in october 2007 , and the second in april 2008 .",
    "the differential energy specrum is calculated only for the april 2008 data set . the measured ( and unfolded for detector effects ) spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spec ] . the last energy point ( at an energy of @xmath17tev )",
    "has a significance lower than 1@xmath18 and was , therefore , converted into an upper limit corresponding to a 95% confidence level .",
    "the measured spectrum can be well fitted by a simple power law ( with the differential flux fiven in units of tev@xmath19 @xmath20 s@xmath19 ) : @xmath21 due to the energy - dependent attenuation of vhe @xmath0-rays with low - energy photons of the extragalactic background ( ebl , @xcite ) , the vhe @xmath0-ray flux of distant sources is significantly suppressed .",
    "we calculated the deabsorbed , i.e.  intrinsic , spectrum of s5  0716 + 714 using an ebl model of @xcite and assuming a redshift of @xmath22 . the resulting intrinsic spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , hollow points ) has a fitted photon index of @xmath23 , which is well within the range of other extragalactic sources measured so far .",
    "magic observed the blazar s5  0716 + 714 in november 2007 and april 2008 , the observations resulting in the discovery of a very high energy @xmath0-ray excess with a significance of @xmath24 . during the november 2007 magic observations the average optical flux was @xmath25mjy , while during the optical flux was @xmath26mjy in april 2008 .",
    "the same trend is also visible in the magic data : the flux in april 2008 is significantly higher than in november 2007 .",
    "this seems to support the indication seen in previous magic observations for other bl lac objects @xcite , that there is a connection between optical high states and vhe @xmath0-ray high states .    in april",
    "2008 s5  0716 + 714 was also in a historical high state in x - rays @xcite and the optical polarization angle started to rotate immediately after the optical maximum has been reached @xcite .",
    "however , the radio flux at 37 ghz did remain at a quiescent level .",
    "this multiwavelength behavior is very similar to the one in bl  lac 2005 @xcite indicating that the flaring events might have a similar origin .",
    "the sed modeling of the available data is not straight forward as there are various simultaneous data suggesting a rather broad inverse compton peak extending from high x - rays ( measured by _ swift _ ) to vhe @xmath0-rays ( magic ) .",
    "a detailed modeling of the source spectrum and an overall sed discussion will be published elsewhere . as the source redshift is still uncertain , we used the magic spectra to calculate upper limits to the redshift .",
    "we assumed two different maximum possible hardness of the intrinsic spectrum : 1.5 , being a canonical value for a @xmath0-ray spectrum emitted by electrons with a spectral index of 2.0 ; and 0.666 , being the limiting case for a @xmath0-ray spectrum emitted by a monoenergetic electron distribution .",
    "we get following upper limits for the redshift : @xmath27 ( assuming the hardest intrinsic index of 1.5 ) and @xmath28 ( assuming the hardest intrinsic index of 2/3 ) .",
    "both limits agree with the redshift determined from the host galaxy detection ( @xmath2 ) and from the spectroscopy of 3 nearby galaxies ( @xmath3 ) .",
