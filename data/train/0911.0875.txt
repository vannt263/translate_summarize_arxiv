    "stimulated by the development of new experimental techniques in the field of ultracold atom gases and pump - probe laser spectroscopy , the simulation and implementation of established condensed matter model hamiltonians in novel experimental setups and the study of their nonequilibrium behavior has florished recently @xcite . in these systems",
    "precise and rapid control over parameters can be combined with a high temporal resolution for the observation of the many - body quantum dynamics .",
    "thus , the switch of an interaction and the analysis of the subsequent response allows to address the interplay of particle correlations imposed by interactions and nonequilibrium initial conditions .    for many systems a slow adiabatic change of a two - particle interaction may modify the ground state(s ) of a system but no excitations to higher energy states occur .",
    "therefore , adiabatic switching procedures allow to develop equilibrium properties of interacting systems from those of noninteracting ones .",
    "due to the broad applicability of this approach they have been counted among the `` basic notions '' of condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example is landau s theory of a fermi liquid @xcite : based on its main prerequisite , the adiabatic increase of the fermion interaction starting from the noninteracting fermi gas , landau could establish a one - to - one relation between the eigenstates of the noninteracting fermi gas and approximate eigenstates of the interacting fermi liquid .",
    "this link allows to carry over an approximate particle - like description to the interacting system and leads to the celebrated and imaginative concept of quasiparticles : reminiscent of the constituent physical fermions , albeit modified by a renormalization of their energies and masses , they represent the elementary excitations of the interacting system .",
    "note that the quality of this approximation , i.e. the considerable time stability of low energy quasiparticles , is owed to phase space restrictions for elastic scattering of fermions around the fermi energy : these restrictions , which emerge from the pauli exclusion principle for fermions , prevent a fast decay of approximate quasiparticles into the true eigenstates of the interacting system and are the root of the universal applicability of fermi liquid theory to many interacting fermionic systems .    however ,",
    "nonadiabatic switching , e.g. of the strength of trapping potentials or magnetic fields , of optical lattices or by applying ultrashort laser ( pump ) pulses may drive a system away even from its interacting ground state .",
    "hence , fast parameter switching has shown to be a helpful tool to impose nonequilibrium initial conditions onto many - particle quantum systems .",
    "the limiting case of an instantaneous switch , called a quantum quench , provides a convenient starting point for theoretical investigations .",
    "afterwards , the evolution of the excited many - body state can be followed in real time and different stages of the relaxation dynamics have been observed .    in fermionic systems , nonadiabatic switching of the interaction",
    "challenges the main prerequisite of fermi liquid theory .",
    "nonetheless , for not too strong sudden interaction quenches within the fermi liquid phase of the hubbard model , it has been predicted analytically @xcite , confirmed numerically @xcite and furtheron discussed @xcite that during the initial stage of the relaxation a nonequilibrium description builds up which is strongly reminiscent of fermi liquid theory .",
    "the same fermionic phase space restrictions which ensure the persistence of quasiparticles in equilibrium restrict a rapid relaxation of the momentum distribution in nonequilibrium .",
    "hence , a transient regime of _ prethermalization _ has been observed .",
    "whereas , for instance , the total kinetic energy has already relaxed to its final value , the momentum distribution combines different features : a sharp step at the fermi energy indicates zero temperature while deviations from its equilibrium shape represent the nonequilibrium nature of the transient state .",
    "hence , during the first phase of the relaxation dynamics no substantial conversion of the initial excitation energy into heat can be observed and thermalization is deferred to a later time scale @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize these observations to finite switching times , assuming a linear ramping procedure .",
    "this introduces a new time scale , the _ ramp - up time _ which is defined as the time duration on which the parameter change occurs .",
    "this ramp up scale can be used deliberately by finite - time ramp - up protocols to prepare a system in particular ( excited ) states which are different from those reachable by sudden switching @xcite .",
    "for instance , ramping on finite time scales has been suggested as a way to access the nonequilibrium regime of systems which are sensitive to heating effects since slower parameter changes reduce the excitation energy inserted into a system .",
    "in particular , this argument has been applied for the analysis of superconducting bcs systems in nonequilibrium .",
    "theoretical studies have examined an interaction quench in the bcs hamiltonian and predicted interesting nonequilibrium dynamics , e.g. oscillations of the order parameter in time @xcite .",
    "however , the bcs interaction emerges from a local two - particle interaction between fermions which is the tunable switching parameter in experiments with ultracold fermions loaded onto an optical lattice .",
    "a realistic modelling of nonequilibrium dynamics in ultracold atomic gases therefore has to start with a quench of a spatially local interaction .",
    "hence , bcs quench dynamics must be discussed against the background of a quenched fermi liquid .",
    "obviously , bcs dynamics can only be expected for temperatures below the critical temperature @xmath0 of superconductivity .",
    "a first approach based on a golden rule argument suggested that overheating can be avoided as energy scales of heating and of the nonadiabaticity requirement imposed on the ramp should separate @xcite .",
    "however , we will show in the sequel that this argument neglects contributions of high energy momentum modes which are relevant in commonly discussed ramping models .",
    "therefore , the argument turns out inconclusive in the case of linear ramping .",
    "fortunately , the problem of overheating is mitigated by two aspects : in another article published in this focus issue m. eckstein and m. kollar discuss the dependence of the excitation energy inserted by interaction ramping on the functional shape of the ramp @xcite ; this opens space for optimizing the ramping procedure .",
    "we address , on the other hand , the intrinsic robustness of fermionic systems at zero temperature to heating .",
    "even for ramping scenarios which do not lead to a clear energy separation of the relevant bcs energy scale and the effective temperature after heating we find a _",
    "temporal _ separation of the characteristic time scales of bcs dynamics and thermalization , respectively .",
    "our observation mirrors the notorious problem of cooling a gas of cold fermionic atoms to even lower temperatures and views a current technical limitation as a desirable feature for future experiments : on the one hand , the pauli principle suppresses s - wave scattering between the fermions .",
    "this hinders the equilibration of the gas at a lower temperature after high energy particles have been lost by evaporation and poses a great challenge to experimentalists on their way to reach a zero temperature fermi gas . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that the same mechanism prevents a rapid thermalization of excitations of high energy modes in a fermionic system which has been previously cooled down to zero temperature .",
    "then a long - lasting transient state of prethermalization emerges during which no heating occurs .",
    "this behavior of cold fermionic many - particle systems will simplify the observation of nonequilibrium bcs dynamics during a long transient time window before thermalization sets in ; since it roots in fermi degeneracy caused by the pauli principle it is independent of any details of the applied ramp .    in this work",
    "we perform a careful investigation of the crossover from adiabatic to instantaneous linear switching procedures on the grounds of second order keldysh perturbation theory .",
    "we follow the evolution of the momentum distribution function for _ original _ fermions after a linear interaction ramp of finite duration @xmath1 and discuss the kinetic energy in a long - time limit of the second order result .",
    "we observe that the corresponding effective temperature is of the same order of magnitude as the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "hence overheating can not be excluded by an argument based on energy scale separation .",
    "however , we still observe prethermalization behavior of the fermi gas ; therefore this temperature is only reached after a long transient regime . since in this regime",
    "the momentum distribution resembles closely a zero - temperature fermi liquid we conclude that the observation of nonequilibrium bcs dynamics can be expected _ before _ overheating wipes out all bcs signatures .",
    "for an analysis of many - body quantum dynamics we implement fermi liquid theory microscopically by the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "it provides a paradigmatic description for correlated fermions on a lattice ; it includes spin and implements the pauli principle by restricting to a local state space of dimension four .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath4 is fixed to ensure half filling .",
    "@xmath5 a momentum space representation is obtained by a fourier transform .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath6 depends on the details of the lattice . for convenience , explicit numerical calculations of the momentum distribution",

    "correlations between the lattice fermions are modeled by a local two - particle interaction @xmath13 acting between fermions of different spin with @xmath14 denoting the local occupation @xmath15 since our interest is in fermi liquid properties of the model , we restrict to a regime of weak interaction strength ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this rules out the observation of any features of the mott - hubbard phase transition . in consequence ,",

    "a real - time keldysh approach following rammer @xcite allows to extract the time dependent behavior of the momentum distribution function @xmath20 from the keldysh component greens function @xmath21 .",
    "both functions are evaluated in second order of the time dependent local two - particle interaction and in the initial representation of noninteracting fermions .",
    "the later implies that interaction effects become visible only by a redistribution of occupation among the unrenormalized momentum modes .",

    "details of the calculation can be found in [ appendixkeldysh ] or in @xcite .",
    "the second order result describes the dynamics of the momentum distribution during a first stage of its relaxation and exhibits the early relaxation of the kinetic energy .",
    "higher order corrections , however , induce different behavior on a second time scale .",
    "we describe this second stage by means of the quantum boltzmann equation , taking the formal long - time limit of the second order keldysh perturbative calculation as an initial condition",
    ". it will lead to a thermalization of the momentum distribution . in section [ sectioneffectiveheating ]",
    "we will justify this treatment , explain the separation of both relaxation scales as a consequence of fermionic phase space restrictions and discuss the characteristics of the transient regime of prethermalization .",
    "we have evaluated the time dependent momentum distribution function of original fermions in the regime @xmath23 for arbitrary ramp - up times @xmath1 . within the validity of second order time - dependent perturbation theory , i.e. for not too large times @xmath24 , the momentum distribution function reads @xmath25 @xmath26 represents a fermionic phase space factor which is discussed in more detail in [ appendixj ] . here",
    "we note that in the case of @xmath27 it is nonvanishing only for negative energies @xmath28 , in the case of @xmath29 for positive ones .",
    "moreover , it asymptotically approaches a quadratic energy dependence for small absolute values of @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "together , these observations imply that all formal energy divergences in equation ( [ keldyshmdfresultkspace ] ) are cut off or regularized by the phase space factor .",
    "a second glance at the result ( [ keldyshmdfresultkspace ] ) shows that contrary to the keldysh greens function itself ( see appendix [ appendixkeldysh]) the momentum distribution function does not exhibit secular terms which are proportional to time @xmath24 and typically would restrict the validity of a perturbative approach to short time regimes .",

    "@xmath108 we have observed that the additional kinetic energy remains smaller than the one inserted under a quantum quench ; moreover , that the momentum distribution function retains a sharp step and differs only quantitatively but not qualitatively from that one of the quantum quench . in consequence , we note that the phase space restrictions for scattering processes are not overcome by finite ramping times . on the contrary ,",
    "the nonequilibrium character of the momentum distribution is less pronounced which makes those restrictions more severe .",

    "it has been shown that a quantum quench in the effective pairing interaction @xmath126 leads to the buildup of a paired many - particle state which , furthermore , exhibits characteristic nonequilibrium signatures . for example , temporal oscillations of the order parameter of the superfluid transition , the energy gap parameter @xmath127 , have been observed .",
    "however , experiments in ultracold fermions are well - described by the hubbard model .",
    "while it is experimentally feasible to change the relative strength of the hubbard interaction in time , it is not possible to do so only for that subset of matrix elements which correspond to the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "hence the question arises whether the dynamics described by the remaining matrix elements interferes with the predicted nonequilibrium bcs dynamics .      in the following",
    "we will address one aspect of that question : whether the effects of the additional heat inserted by the feasible quench of the hubbard interaction as compared to a theoretical quench of the bcs interaction alone already rule out the observation of nonequilibrium bcs dynamics .",
    "obviously , the inserted energy depends on the ramping time . in order to observe nonequilibrium bcs dynamics in ultracold fermi gases ,",
    "two competing requirements must be met :    * firstly , the ramping must be sufficiently nonadiabatic to excite nonequilibrium behavior . * secondly , the system must not heat up beyond the critical temperature of superconductivity despite the energy intake by the ramping .    in a previous work @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that a ramp - up which is nonadiabatic on the scale of the bcs instability , i.e. @xmath128 is sufficient to excite nonequilibrium bcs dynamics . as @xmath129 is typically a small parameter and",
    "as the kinetic energy depends inversely on the ramp - up time , this eases the problem of overheating with respect to a sudden quantum quench .      however , plugging the slowest sufficiently nonadiabatic linear ramp @xmath130 ( cf .",
    "[ tdelta ] ) into ( [ teffut ] ) shows that even for that limiting case the energy intake is not negligibly small . instead , the final temperature is of a similar order of magnitude as the characteristic energies involved in the bcs dynamics , namely @xmath131 .",
    "hence , energetic arguments do not imply a clear separation of energy scales related to the nonequilibrium bcs dynamics and temperature , respectively .",
    "therefore , we expect that _ finally _ the temperature will influence and possibly destroy the nonequilibrium bcs behavior .",
    "fortunately , the thermalization of the momentum distribution is delayed by prethermalization . for the limiting ramping time @xmath132 thermalization due to elastic scattering processes",
    "is deferred to the time scale set by @xmath133 for small interaction strength , the elastic relaxation time becomes much larger than the time scale of the bcs dynamics .",
    "hence a long - lasting transient time window is opened by prethermalization ; during this time the momentum distribution around the fermi energy resembles that one of a fermi liquid at zero temperature and most of the excitation energy is virtually stored in high energy modes sufficiently far apart from it .",
    "thus we expect the buildup of the bcs instability and the persistence of bcs dynamics until quasiparticle scattering redistributes the excitation energies down to low energy modes , implying thermalization .    based on our observation of prethermalization we are happy to report that nonequilibrium bcs dynamics is , in principle , accessible by suitable linear ramping protocols performed with ultracold fermions",
    ". other ramping protocols as discussed by eckstein and kollar can further facilitate these experiments by reducing the effective temperature .",

    "the time scale set by the hopping matrix element . in both cases an initial relaxation ( ir ) is followed by a transient prethermalization regime and final thermalization ( th ) .",
    "the finally achieved effective temperature is of the order or larger than the critical temperature of superconductivity .",
    "note that the prethermalization regime following a sudden quench may not reach into the time regime where signatures of the bcs nonequilibrium dynamics can be expected .",
    "hence the long duration of the prethermalization regime in the case of finite time ramping is crucial for a clear observability of nonequilibrium bcs dynamics.,width=453 ]",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the implications of linearly ramping up the interaction strength of the hubbard model in more than one dimension and at zero temperature .",
    "we assumed a finite ramping time and discussed corrections to the adiabatic limit as well as the crossover into a quantum quench using second order keldysh perturbation theory in real time .",
    "we observed different relaxation behavior for two observables , namely the momentum distribution and the kinetic energy . on the one hand",
    ", the momentum distribution does not relax on a first time scale which is related to second order perturbation theory ; it shows a characteristic mismatch of the quasiparticle residue if compared with adiabatic ramping .",
    "this mismatch provides a quantitative measure for the nonequilibrium character of the momentum distribution in the first time regime after ramping . on the other hand the kinetic energy summed over",
    "all momentum modes remains unchanged under the subsequent boltzmann dynamics of the momentum distribution ; the later becomes effective on a second , much longer time scale and leads to the thermalization of the momentum distribution .",
    "consequently , a transient time regime characterized by prethermalization appears between these two well - seperated time scales . during this regime",
    "the excitation energy of the switching process is present predominantly in high energy momentum modes ; around the fermi energy a zero - temperature description remains applicable . for small deviations from adiabatic switching , i.e. for small energy intakes due to the ramping ,",
    "this regime is particular extended in time .",
    "we compute the dependence of the final temperature on the ramping time and explain how differing expectations have been obtained previously .",
    "finally we apply our findings to the question whether nonequilibrium bcs dynamics can be observed in ultracold fermi gases . on the one hand",
    ", the final temperature reaches the same order of magnitude as the critical temperature of the bcs problem which makes the observation of such dynamics in a true long - time limit at least very difficult . on the other hand , a suitable choice of the ramping speed and the observed prethermalization of the momentum distribution function open a long transient time window ; during that time the excitation energy inserted by the ramping remains located in high energy momentum modes .",
    "therefore , nonequilibrium bcs dynamics , which happens on a small energy scale around the fermi surface , is not affected by the inserted energy .",
    "we expect that prethermalization fosters in a similar way the observability of low - temperature nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of other phenomena which also require the presence of a sharp fermi surface .",

    "interaction effects are switched on adiabatically , treated perturbatively and switched off again on the way of a linear time evolution .",
    "perturbation theory beyond the ground state , however , can not rely on the gell - mann and low theorem which only links ground states .",
    "therefore , calculations have to be performed on a closed time contour , mapping the outgoing state back into a representation of the ingoing states . the keldysh technique @xcite has implemented this contour evolution for the calculation of nonequilibrium greens functions by representing those on a @xmath136 keldysh index space .",
