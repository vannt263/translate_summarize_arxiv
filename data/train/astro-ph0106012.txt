    "the large - scale structure of the universe represents one of the most powerful discriminants between cosmological models .",
    "we are using the aat 2df facility to make a redshift survey of some 25000 @xmath16 qsos ( boyle et al .",
    "2000 , croom et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "qsos are highly effective probes of the structure of the universe over a wide range of scales and can trace clustering evolution over a look - back time which is 70 - 80% of its present age .",
    "the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) comprises two @xmath17 declination strips , one at the south galactic pole and one in an equatorial region in the north galactic cap .",
    "qsos are selected by ultra - violet excess ( uvx ) in the @xmath18-@xmath19:@xmath19-@xmath20 plane , using apm measurements of uk schmidt telescope photographic plates ( smith et al .",
    "the 2df spectra obtained are identified automatically by autoz ( miller et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which also determines the redshift of the qsos .",
    "these identifications are confirmed by two independent observers .",
    "approximately 18000 qso redshifts have been obtained to date , making this survey already an order of magnitude larger than any previous qso survey .",
    "observations of high redshift type ia supernovae ( snia ) have recently been used to measure the cosmological constant , @xmath1 ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; reiss et al .",
    "1998 ) . by making the simple assumption that snia are standard candles",
    ", one can use the apparent luminosity and redshift of such supernovae to constrain the distance - redshift relation , hence determining the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we currently do nt have a good understanding of snia physical processes , and there are still some uncertainties regarding the standard candle assumption .",
    "for example , the above analyses apply a little understood empirical correction to the peak magnitude based on the decline rate of the sn light curve .",
    "there have also been suggestions that the sn light curves may be affected by cosmic dust ( e.g. aguirre 1999 ) , or evolve with redshift ( e.g. drell , loredo & wasserman 2000 ; reiss et al .",
    "1999a , b ; see however aldering , knop & nugent 2000 ) .",
    "alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) suggested that @xmath1 might also be measured from distortions in the shape of large - scale structure .",
    "geometrical distortions occur if the wrong cosmology is assumed , due to the different dependence on cosmology of the redshift - distance relation along and across the line of sight .",
    "phillipps ( 1994 ) suggested that by making the simple assumption that clustering in real - space is on average spherically symmetric , geometrical distortions due to @xmath1 could be detected by comparing the distribution of radial and transverse separations of qso pairs .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it depends only on the assumption of isotropy , without the need for a standard candle .",
    "we apply a related test to the 2qz qsos .",
    "we can measure the clustering of qsos parallel and perpendicular to the observer s line of sight , through the two - point correlation function , or in this case , the power spectrum , @xmath0 . only if we make the correct assumption about geometry would no anisotropic geometric distortion be detected .",
    "unfortunately the problem is complicated by the fact that redshift - space distortions are also caused by peculiar velocities . on the large , linear scales probed by the power spectrum coherent peculiar velocities due to infall into overdense regions are the main cause of anisotropy . according to gravitational instability theory",
    "these distortions depend only on the density and bias parameters via @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the redshift - space distortions in the power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer s line of sight , @xmath0 , using mock 2qz catalogues generated from the _ hubble volume _ simulation ( frenk et al .",
    "the aim is to determine how well we will be able to measure the important cosmological parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 using the 2qz observations .",
    "we apply the model from ballinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the redshift - space distortions to a measurement of @xmath0 from the simulated qso catalogue , and derive a joint constraint on @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the angular dependence of geometrical distortions differs only slightly from that of the redshift - space distortions , and so the constraint is fairly degenerate . to break the degeneracy ,",
    "different constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath4 need to be considered . here",
    "we examine one possibility based on the evolution of mass clustering from the average redshift of the 2qz to the present day .",
    "finally we apply the method to the first public release of the 2qz ; the _ 10k catalogue _ ( croom et al .",
    "in order to test how effectively the 2qz will measure large - scale structure , we are using the virgo consortium s huge _",
    "hubble volume _",
    "n - body @xmath1cdm simulation ( frenk et al .",
    "2000 ) to simulate three light cone strips of the 2qz .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are @xmath22=0.04 , @xmath23=0.26 , @xmath24=0.7 , @xmath25=70 km s@xmath26mpc@xmath26 and the normalisation , @xmath27 , is 0.9 , consistent with the abundance of hot x - ray clusters ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) and with the level of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) found by cobe ( smoot et al .",
    "one billion mass particles are contained within a cube that is 3,000@xmath28mpc on a side .",
    "one of the vertices was chosen to be the observer and the long axis of the light - cone was oriented along the maximal diagonal .",
    "the light - cone therefore extends to a depth of @xmath295,000@xmath28mpc , which corresponds to @xmath304 in the @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "the solid angle of the light - cone is 75@xmath3115 degrees which is split into three 75@xmath315 degree slices .",
    "the 2qz consists of 2 such slices , and so to generate the mock catalogue we use the two disconnected slices .",
    "we also consider the third slice for the error analysis .",
    "to create realistic mock catalogues , we must bias the mass particles to give a similar clustering pattern , and the same angular and radial selection function and sampling expected in the final 2df survey . the biasing prescription adopted follows method 2 as described by cole et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , with the parameters chosen to produce a constant clustering amplitude with redshift - as seen in previous surveys ( croom & shanks 1996 ) .",
    "it is an eulerian , or final density scheme due to the nature of the n - body simulation output , and is based only on the local density field , implying asymptotic scale - independence of the bias on the large scales we are probing .",
    "the biased particles were then sparsely sampled to match the radial distribution of the qsos in the preliminary 2df catalogue , and the expected number density of the final catalogue over the redshift range @xmath32 . for further details see hoyle ( 2000 ) .    the _ hubble volume _",
    "simulation was designed to probe large - scale structure , at the expense of spatial resolution . as a result",
    "the simulation does not probe any structure on scales @xmath33mpc . in this analysis we are binning the data onto a grid with bin size @xmath34mpc , and only considering power on scales @xmath35mpc ,",
    "so we expect this to have little effect on our final results .",
    "the power spectrum estimation is carried out as described in outram , hoyle & shanks ( 2001 ) , using the method outlined in hoyle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and tadros & efstathiou ( 1996 ) . in order to apply the distant observer approximation ( see section  [ datageom ] ) the mock qso survey is divided into four regions .",
    "each region is embedded into a larger cubical volume , which is rotated such that the central line of sight lies along the same axis of the cube in each case .",
    "the density field is binned onto a 256@xmath36 mesh , using nearest grid - point assignment .",
    "the power spectrum of each region is estimated using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and the average of the resulting power spectra is taken .",
    "the result , binned logarithmically into @xmath37 and @xmath38 , is plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the 2qz covers two declination strips of approximately @xmath39 , and we have three such mock declination strips available .",
    "when calculating @xmath0 information about the line of sight must be retained . to achieve this",
    "the data are divided into subsamples that subtend a small solid angle on the sky , and the distant - observer approximation is then applied .",
    "the data from each declination strip are split into 4 regions each approximately @xmath40 during this analysis , and the average of the resulting power spectra is taken .",
    "this approach introduces a small systematic error ; the measured @xmath0 is in fact a convolution between the true power spectrum and a function related to the sample window introduced due to the assumption of parallel lines of sight . the resulting power spectrum is more isotropic , and this leads to a small , yet systematic under - estimate of @xmath4 . for a @xmath40 window",
    "this error is @xmath41 and considerably smaller than the statistical errors obtained .",
    "although it is possible to correct for this effect ( see cole et al .",
    "1994 ) , for the purposes of this analysis we have chosen to ignore it .    the measured power spectrum is also convolved with the power spectrum of the window function . as the qso co - moving number density",
    "is almost constant out to very large scales ( hoyle et al .",
    "2001a ) , we are effectively considering a volume limited sample .",
    "hence each qso carries equal weight , and the survey window function , @xmath42 , simply takes a value of unity in the volume of the universe included in the survey , and zero elsewhere .",
    "this is approximated using a catalogue containing a large number of unclustered points with the same radial and angular distribution as the survey , and its power spectrum is calculated in a similar manner to that of the data .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the power spectrum of the window function , @xmath43 , as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and figure  [ figwin1d ] shows the window function plotted as a function of @xmath44 , with a comparison against that of a normal @xmath45 analysis , binning in shells of @xmath44 .",
    "the window function is sharply peaked in @xmath46-space , varying as a steep power law , @xmath47 or steeper ; much steeper than the expected qso power spectrum .",
    "therefore the convolution should have little effect at wavenumbers where @xmath43 takes a value much less than about a tenth of its maximum value .",
    "there is some evidence in figure  [ fig1 ] that the window function is slightly shallower along , and in particular across the line of sight .",
    "the directional dependence of the window function also explains the scatter seen in figure  [ figwin1d ] .",
    "this extension at low values of @xmath37 is due to the relatively narrow width of the declination strips ; @xmath48 at @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50mpc , or @xmath51 . to avoid any problems caused by such effects we consider only those regions with @xmath37 & @xmath52 @xmath53mpc@xmath26 .",
    "the errors in the power spectrum are estimated in two ways .",
    "firstly we have three separate strips on which the analysis is carried out , and we can estimate the error from the dispersion in the three measurements .",
    "alternatively we can consider the error estimate of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ; fkp ) .",
    "a comparison of the two error estimates is shown in figure  [ figerr ] .",
    "the two estimates agree fairly well , but with large scatter .",
    "although some of the scatter in the error estimates is intrinsic , the dependence of the error on the angle of the wavevector to the line of sight , as seen in figure  [ figerr2 ] , also contributes to the scatter .",
    "the fkp error is , on average , slightly lower than the error estimated from the dispersion across the mock strips .",
    "neither approach is ideal ; the error estimated from the dispersion has a high uncertainty due to the small number of mock catalogues , whereas the fkp error estimate assumes a thin shell geometry , and can under - estimate the error on some scales , due , for example , to the onset of non - linearity .",
    "to minimise such problems , we took the error in each bin to be the larger of the two estimates .",
    "the adopted fractional errors are shown in figure  [ figerr2 ] .",
    "the power spectrum model incorporating redshift distortions that we fit to the data is presented in ballinger , peacock and heavens ( 1996 ) . for clarity and convenience",
    "we review the main details below .",
    "the power spectrum analysis was carried out assuming an @xmath6=0.3 , @xmath24=0.7 universe , matching that of the _ hubble volume _ simulation .",
    "if the true geometry differs from this then our distance calculations will be wrong be a factor @xmath54 perpendicular to the line of sight , and @xmath55 along the line of sight ( as defined in ballinger et al .",
    "thus we can define a geometric flattening factor :    @xmath56    ( ballinger et al . 1996 ) . for an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , and lambda - dominated ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) universe , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively at the mean depth of the survey ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the effect this has on the power spectrum is given by @xmath60^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\ ] ] ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the spectral index of the power spectrum .      on large , linear scales the main cause of anisotropy are coherent peculiar velocities due to the infall of galaxies into overdense regions .",
    "this anisotropy takes a very simple form in redshift - space , depending only on the density and bias parameters via the combination @xmath21 : @xmath63 ^ 2\\ ] ] ( kaiser 1987 ) where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 refer to the redshift - space and real - space power spectra respectively .",
    "the kaiser formula also assumes the distant - observer approximation , and hence is valid in this case due to the method of estimation of @xmath66 (   [ datageom ] ) .",
    "we expect the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath6 , and hence @xmath4 to vary as a function of redshift .",
    "to keep the number of free parameters to a minimum , however , we have chosen to fit a single average value of @xmath68 over the redshift range , @xmath69 , probed by the qsos .",
    "large variations of @xmath4 over this range could introduce a systematic error into our results , however , the value of @xmath70 determined from the first 10000 2df qsos suggests that any variation with redshift is relatively small ( see section  [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "we hope to investigate the evolution of @xmath4 in more detail using the final 2qz sample of 25000 qsos .",
    "anisotropy in the power - spectrum is dominated by the galaxy velocity dispersions in virialized clusters on small , non - linear scales .",
    "this is modelled by introducing a damping term .",
    "the line of sight pairwise velocity ( @xmath71 ) is implicitly divided by @xmath72 and quoted in units @xmath73mpc .",
    "( @xmath74km@xmath75s@xmath76mpc@xmath26 ) ] distribution is modelled using an exponential , which produces a better fit to both observations and n - body simulations than either a gaussian or power law distribution ( davis & peebles 1983 ; fisher et al .",
    "observational redshift determination errors may add a second , gaussian component to the observed velocity dispersion of the 2qz qsos ( see section  [ rederr ] ) .",
    "an exponential is given by a lorentzian factor in redshift - space : @xmath77=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(k\\mu\\sigma_p\\right)^2}\\ ] ] this model is only a good approximation in mildly non - linear situations .",
    "cole et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used numerical simulations to show that it is effective for wavelengths @xmath78mpc , or @xmath79 ; considerably smaller than the scales we are considering . at these wavenumbers",
    "the difference between models assuming a gaussian or exponential velocity dispersion is negligible ( ballinger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "combining these effects leads to the final model : @xmath80^{\\frac{n-4}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left[1+\\mu^2\\left(\\frac{\\beta+1}{f^2}-1\\right)\\right]^2 d\\left[k\\mu\\sigma_p^{\\prime}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) where @xmath81 .",
    "there are several free parameters in the model ; @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , the underlying real - space power spectrum .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties on the parameters of interest , @xmath84 we make simple assumption about the other parameters .",
    "@xmath71 has relatively little effect on the power spectrum at large scales and so is not well constrained in this analysis .",
    "we have chosen to fix it at @xmath85km@xmath75s@xmath26 ; the measured value of the _ hubble volume _ simulation at @xmath86 ( hoyle 2000 ) .",
    "this is similar to recent measurements from local galaxy surveys ( outram et al .",
    "2001 , peacock et al .",
    "whilst it may be expected that @xmath71 falls with increasing redshift , the finite resolution of the _ hubble volume _ simulation , @xmath87mpc , introduces an additional velocity dispersion of similar order that keeps the observed value artificially high . a similar effect due to redshift determination errors",

    "the effects can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "there is a small systematic shift in the best - fit @xmath90 relation that becomes insignificant at low values of @xmath6 . a similar analysis of redshift - space distortions considering @xmath91 ( hoyle et al .",
    "2001b ) is sensitive to smaller - scale clustering and so should constrain @xmath71 in the 2qz more effectively .",

    "although the input real - space power spectrum is available for the simulation , this is not the case for the 2qz , and so we choose not to use it .",

    ", we need to detect variations of order two in the power spectrum due to geometrical and redshift distortions .",
    "we fit the model to the data using a @xmath97 technique : @xmath98 the errors , @xmath99 , are the larger of the fkp error and the dispersion across the three catalogues in each bin .",
    "only those wavenumbers with @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are used in the fit .",
    "the former constraints are applied to remove the effects of the window function , and the latter because the fft is unreliable at smaller scales .",

    "this suggests that the errors have been slightly under - estimated .",
    "however , as figure  [ fig3 ] shows , the fit is highly degenerate , and any values along the solid line are acceptable .",

    "the angular dependence of geometrical distortions differs only slightly from that of the redshift - space distortions , and so the constraint is fairly degenerate . to break this degeneracy , a different constraint on @xmath6 and @xmath4 needs to be considered .",
    "here we examine one possibility based on the evolution of mass clustering from the average redshift of the 2qz to the present day .",
    "one of the early results from the 2df galaxy redshift survey is a measurment of @xmath109 ( peacock et al .",
    "2001 ) , using redshift - space distortions in the two - point galaxy correlation function .",
    "for each cosmology ( again we only consider flat cosmologies ) the value of the galaxy - mass bias can be found from @xmath110 , which in turn gives the value of the mass correlation function if the galaxy correlation function at @xmath111 is known , as shown below .",
    "the evolution in the mass correlation function can be calculated for this cosmology , and hence by comparing the @xmath86 to mass correlation function to that of the qsos , an estimate of the qso bias factor can be obtained .",
    "finally , this can be used to derive an estimate of @xmath112 as a function of cosmology .",
    "one possible caveat with this technique is that we are comparing values of @xmath113 and @xmath112 that were measured using different estimators and on different scales . to minimise any possible systematic effects this analysis",
    "could be carried out self - consistently using the same method to determine @xmath113 ( outram , hoyle & shanks 2000 ) . as the 2df galaxy redshift survey data is not yet available ,",
    "we have chosen for simplicity to use a correlation function analysis .",
    "rather than determining the value of the two - point correlation function at one particular point , we use the less noisy volume averaged two - point correlation function out to @xmath114mpc , @xmath115 . to estimate the redshift space , volume averaged two - point correlation function of galaxies , @xmath116 , we assume that the galaxy correlation function can be approximated by a power law of the form @xmath117mpc@xmath118 .",

    "there is a small anisotropy introduced by the minimum separation of fibres on the 2df instrument .",
    "as the fibres can not be placed closer together than @xmath162 , close pairs of qsos can not be observed simultaneously , and this introduces an angular selection function against such pairs in the 10k catalogue .",
    "this is being addressed through separate observations of the qsos missed for the final catalogue .",
    "the scales we are probing are considerably larger than those affected by this selection effect ; at @xmath86 , @xmath163 corresponds to @xmath164 .",
    "hence we expect that this selection function should have little effect on our results .    due to the lower number of qsos , and a more complicated window function ,",
    "the power spectrum measurements were very noisy , and only coarse binning in @xmath37 and @xmath38 was possible .",
    "figure  [ fig10000data ] shows @xmath0 estimated from the 2qz 10k catalogue .",
    "the power spectrum of the window function of the 10k catalogue are shown in figure  [ figwin1d10 ] .",
    "due to the current incomplete coverage , the points lie slightly above those of the mock catalogue .",
    "the window function is still sharply peaked in @xmath46-space , however , and so by considering only those regions with @xmath37 & @xmath52 @xmath53mpc@xmath26 , any window function effects should still be negligible .",
    "there is an uncertainty in determining qso redshifts from low s / n spectra of @xmath165 ( croom et al .",
    "2001b ) , which , at the average redshift of the survey , assuming @xmath1cdm , corresponds to an uncertainty in the line - of - sight distance of @xmath166mpc .",
    "this introduces an apparent velocity dispersion of @xmath167km@xmath75s@xmath26 . by adding this in quadrature to the intrinsic small - scale velocity dispersion in the qso population",
    ", we therefore expect an observed velocity dispersion of @xmath168km@xmath75s@xmath26 ( assuming an intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath169km@xmath75s@xmath26 ) .",
    "a second possible source of redshift determination error , due to the intrinsic variation in line centroids between qsos is harder to estimate .",
    "although the intrinsic pairwise velocity dispersion is perhaps best modelled with an exponential , the apparent velocity dispersion introduced by redshift determination errors is more likely to have a gaussian distribution , and hence ideally we should adopt a model that is a convolution of both . at the scales we are considering , however , there is virtually no difference between the two models ( ballinger et al . 1996 ) , and so we have continued to adopt an exponential model .    to test this we introduced a @xmath170mpc gaussian dispersion to the line - of - sight distances of the mock qsos from the _ hubble volume _ simulation and",
    "repeated the analysis . still assuming @xmath171km@xmath75s@xmath26 , the best - fitting value of @xmath6 was systematically higher for any given value of @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in section  [ reddist ] an under - estimation of @xmath71 would lead to such a systematic shift .",
    "this was removed by increasing the value of @xmath71 in the model to take into account the apparent velocity dispersion introduced due to redshift determination error , assuming instead a value of @xmath172km@xmath75s@xmath26 .    as discussed in section  [ reddist ] , and shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , @xmath71 is not well constrained in this analysis , and so we have chosen to fix it at @xmath172km@xmath75s@xmath26 for the 2qz analysis . a complementary approach , using the two - point correlation function",
    ", @xmath91 is more sensitive to non - linear effects , such as the velocity dispersion , as it probes smaller scales , and so should provide a stronger constraint on @xmath71 . a careful analysis of the errors in redshift determination of 2qz qsos using autoz",
    "would also constrain our assumed @xmath71 further .      as before , we reconstructed a real - space power spectrum self - consistently from the measured 2qz qso redshift - space power spectrum ( hoyle et al . 2001a ) , by inverting the above redshift distortion equations for an average value of @xmath92 .",
    "the result of fitting the redshift - space distortions model to the observed power spectrum , @xmath0 , is shown in figure  [ fig10000fit ] .",
    "a nominal best fit of @xmath173 , and @xmath174 is obtained , with @xmath175 over 31 degrees of freedom .",
    "the fit is highly degenerate , however , and little constraint on either parameter alone can be reached .",
    "when we jointly consider the @xmath6 , @xmath4 constraint from mass clustering evolution , as discussed in section  [ massclu ] , a @xmath1cdm cosmology is marginally favoured with joint best fit values of @xmath8 and @xmath176 being obtained ( see figure  [ figjoint10 ] ) .",
    "the quoted errors include statistical errors and the systematic error due to a @xmath177km@xmath75s@xmath26 uncertainty in @xmath71 .",
    "if the error in determining qso redshifts were over - estimated by croom et al .",
    "( 2001b ) then we would find slightly lower values for @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "this result is in line with the recent determination of @xmath1 from high reshift supernovae .",
    "perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) obtained an estimate of @xmath178 , assuming a flat cosmology . whilst statistically stronger than the geometric method , sn1a physics is still poorly understood and it is possible that evolutionary effects could introduce large systematic errors ( drell et al .",
    "the method described in this paper provides an independent determination of @xmath1 that relies only on the assumption of isotropy , and relatively well understood redshift distortion models .",
    "the value of @xmath179 obtained is almost identical to that of local galaxies ; e.g. @xmath109 determined using the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( peacock et al .",
    "if qsos trace average galaxy environments , as suggested by deep imaging around qsos ( e.g. croom & shanks 1999 ) , measurements of qso clustering ( croom et al .",
    "2001a , hoyle et al .",
    "2001a ) , and the observation that most , if not all , major galaxies appear to host a supermassive black hole ( magorrian 1998 ) , then @xmath4 appears to vary very little as a function of redshift . with a larger qso sample",
    ", we should be able to investigate the evolution of @xmath4 by measuring it in narrower redshift bins",
    ". the main caveat would be whether we really are comparing the same population of objects at different redshifts .      using the _ hubble volume _ simulation ,",
    "we have demonstrated that a significant constraint on the @xmath1 and @xmath4 parameters will be available once the qso survey is complete . the current survey , however , has fewer qsos and a complicated window function . to investigate if this window function has any systematic effect on the 10k results we can again turn to the _ hubble volume_.    we have repeated the power spectral analysis of the _ hubble volume _ simulation , using the current 2qz window function when constructing a mock catalogue of 10000 qsos . the results are shown in figure  [ fig10000hv ] .",
    "the constraint on the @xmath1 and @xmath4 parameters obtained from the 10k _ hubble volume _",
    "simulation is very similar to that obtained from the 10k 2qz catalogue , although with slightly larger uncertainty .",
    "the joint best fit values obtained , taking into account the mass clustering evolution method described in section  [ massclu ] , are @xmath180 and @xmath181 . comparing the results derived from the 10k and 25k mock catalogues",
    ", there is a shift in the best fitting parameters to a slightly higher @xmath4 for a given @xmath6 when the incomplete window function is considered , however the two constraints are entirely consistent within the errors , indicating that possible systematic effects due to the 10k window function are fairly small . if this shift is systematic then taking it into account would slightly weaken the significance of our @xmath1 constraint from the 10k 2qz catalogue .",
    "when the 2qz is complete , a powerful geometric test for the cosmological constant ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) will be available .",
    "the distance between a pair of qsos measured along the line of sight , calculated from the relative redshifts , has a different dependence on the cosmological parameters than the distance measured in the angular direction . by comparing the clustering along and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiar velocities and bulk motions in redshift space",
    ", geometric and redshift - space distortions can be detected .    in this paper",
    "we have examined the potential of this test by considering the anisotropy in the 2qz power spectrum .",
    "ballinger et al . ( 1996 ) developed a model to estimate @xmath1 and @xmath4 from the geometric and redshift - space distortions seen in the power spectra of redshift surveys .",
    "we have applied this model to a detailed simulation of the 2qz , produced using the virgo consortium s huge _",
    "hubble volume _",
    "n - body @xmath1-cdm light cone simulation .",
    "the results confirm the conclusions of ballinger et al . ; the shape of the redshift - space and geometric distortions are very similar , and discriminating between the two to produce a purely geometric constraint on @xmath1 is difficult .",
    "when all the uncertainties in measuring @xmath0 for the 2qz are taken into account we have found that only a joint @xmath3 constraint is possible .",
    "however , by combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clustering evolution , we can make significant progress .",
    "we predict that this should allow us to constrain @xmath4 to approximately @xmath5 , and @xmath6 to @xmath7 in the final 25k survey .",
    "note that throughout this paper we have assumed a flat cosmology .",
    "one possible caveat with this technique is that we are comparing values of @xmath113 and @xmath112 that were potentially measured using different estimators and on different scales . to minimise any possible systematic effects",
    "the value of @xmath113 could be measured using the same method ( outram , hoyle & shanks 2000 ) .",
    "although at a much lower redshift , there will also still be a small cosmological dependence in the result which should be taken into account .    applying this analysis to the 2qz 10k catalogue",
    "we find that a @xmath1cdm cosmology is favoured with joint best fit values of @xmath8 and @xmath176 being obtained .",
    "an uncertainty in determining qso redshifts from low s / n spectra of @xmath165 introduces an apparent velocity dispersion of @xmath167km@xmath75s@xmath26 .",
    "the quoted errors include a systematic error due to a @xmath177km@xmath75s@xmath26 uncertainty in @xmath71 .",
    "a careful analysis of the errors in redshift determination of 2qz qsos using autoz would help constrain this ; if the errors in determining qso redshifts are currently over - estimated then we would find slightly lower values for @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "a second possible source of redshift determination error , due to the intrinsic variation in line centroids between qsos , is harder to estimate .    a complementary approach , using the two - point correlation function , @xmath91 , to investigate redshift - space distortions in qso clustering",
    "can also be considered ( matsubara & suto 1996 ) . this approach probes smaller scales , and so is more sensitive to non - linear effects , such as the velocity dispersion .",
    "a second paper will investigate the application of this analysis to the 2qz ( hoyle et al .",
    "the 2qz is based on observations made with the anglo - australian telescope and the uk schmidt telescope , and we would like to thank our colleagues on the 2df galaxy redshift survey team and all the staff at the aat that have helped to make this survey possible . we would like to thank adrian jenkins , gus evrard , and the virgo consortium for kindly providing the _ hubble volume _ simulations .",
