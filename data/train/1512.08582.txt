    "in a series of papers , we are going to present observations regarding the properties of young low - metallicity clusters in order to characterize the metallicity dependence of star - formation processes , such as the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation efficiency .",
    "the study of disk fraction for young clusters can also be used to characterize the metallicity dependence of planet formation processes @xcite .",
    "however , the study of star formation under low metallicity is attracting attention because it is important to characterize the star formation in the early universe .",
    "moreover , it is critical for understanding the star formation process itself .    because of the galactic metallicity gradient , our galaxy contains clusters with various metallicity ranging from @xmath0 } \\sim -1.5 $ ] in the outermost galaxy to @xmath0 } \\sim + 0.5 $ ] in the innermost galaxy .",
    "our first targets are low - metallicity clusters because 1 ) the large dynamic range of metallicity can be explored on the low - metallicity side better than the high - metallicity side ( up to @xmath9 } \\sim + 0.5 $ ] ) ; 2 ) low - metallicity are good alternative targets for studying star formation in nearby dwarf galaxies that have similar low - metallicity environments and much higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than the substellar regime , and 3 ) they can serve as laboratories for studying star formation in the epoch of galaxy formation . because the average metallicity in the universe is just below the solar metallicity @xcite , clusters with subsolar metallicity represent the most ubiquitous past star - formation .    for studying low - metallicity clusters , we focused on the outer galaxy ( galactocentric radius : @xmath10kpc ) .",
    "clusters in the outer galaxy are much closer ( heliocentric distance : @xmath11kpc ) than lmc / smc ( @xmath12kpc ) , which is often observed ; thus , they are well suited for precisely studying star formation in a low - metallicity environment . however , because the outer galaxy is beyond the solar neighborhood ( @xmath13kpc ) , we used near - infrared ( nir ) deep @xmath14 images from the subaru 8.2 m telescope as primary sensitivity data down to the substellar regime ( @xmath40.1@xmath5 ) , which is similar to the mass detection limit of extensive observations of embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood with smaller ( 24 m class ) telescopes .",
    "large ground - based telescopes also offer high spatial resolution that allows resolving stars in distant clusters .",
    "therefore , we can compare the properties of star formation in low - metallicity environments with those in the solar neighborhood on the same basis .",
    "we selected sample clusters from the sharpless catalog @xcite , which lists photographically h@xmath15-selected bright regions mostly in the 1st and 2nd quadrants of our galaxy . although a number of lower mass clusters are known to exist in the far outer galaxy ( @xmath16kpc ; e.g. , @xcite ; ) or the extreme outer galaxy ( @xmath17kpc ; e.g. , cloud 2 : @xcite ; @xcite ; wb89 - 789 : @xcite ; cloud 1 : @xcite ) , we focus on the relatively prominent young clusters associated with sharpless regions to maximize the astronomical properties of clusters with a significant number of cluster members .    as the first measurement of the metallicity and distance",

    "@xcite carefully assessed the abundance gradient of our galaxy with regions using new observations @xcite along with the data in the literature . a number of clusters were selected with known oxygen metallicity @xmath18 } \\leq -0.5$]dex , assuming solar abundance of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we selected four of eight candidate clusters : sh 2 - 207 ( s207 ) , sh 2 - 208 , sh 2 - 209 , as primary targets .    in this study , we present the first results for s207 , which is one of the lowest metallicity star - forming regions , @xmath20 , in the galaxy located in the 2nd quadrant .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : ",
    "2 discusses previous studies about s207 and star - forming activities in s207 using wise ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ) and 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) data ;   3 describes subaru moircs ( multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ) deep @xmath14 images and data reduction ; ",
    "4 describes the results for a star - forming cluster in s207 ; and in   5 , we discuss the implications for the basic cluster parameters , such as age , distance , imf , and disk fraction .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of the target star - forming region s207 . in table  [ tab : targets ] , we summarize the properties from previous works , i.e. , the coordinate , distance , oxygen abundance , and metallicity .",
