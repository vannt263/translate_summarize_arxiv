    "the magnetic properties of materials are usually described in the frame of system models , such as heisenberg or ising models where rigorous results , or suitable mean field approximations are available in the thermodynamical limit . on the other side ,",
    "modern applications require to deal with nano - sized magnetic materials , whose intrinsic features lead , from one side to the emergence of quantum phenomena@xcite , and to the other to the question of applicability of statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed , few particle systems do not usually fit in the class of systems where the powerful tools of statistical mechanics can be applied at glance . in particular , an exhaustive theory able to fill the gap between the description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interacting particles is still missing . moreover , also important well - established thermodynamical concepts as the temperature , become questionable at the nano - scale@xcite . in a similar way ,",
    "long - range interacting systems belong , since long , to the class where standard statistical mechanics can not be applied _ tout court_. indeed , they display a number of bizarre behaviors , to quote but a few , negative specific heat @xcite and hence ensemble inequivalence @xcite , temperature jumps , and long - time relaxation ( quasi - stationary states)@xcite . therefore , from this point of view , few - body short - range interacting systems share some similarities with many - body long - range ones .",
    "within such a scenario , and thanks to the modern computer capabilities , it is quite natural take a different point of view , starting investigations directly from the dynamics , classical and quantum as well @xcite .",
    "it was in this spirit that quite recently in a class of anisotropic heisenberg - like spin lattice systems , a topological non - connection of the phase space was discovered @xcite .",
    "initially , for historical reasons @xcite , this was referred to as broken ergodicity , since if the phase space is decomposable in two unconnected parts ( hence topologically non - connected ) then a breaking of the ergodicity is indeed a trivial consequence @xcite . here",
    "we prefer to call topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) the value @xmath2 where such a disconnection sets in upon lowering the total energy @xmath3 of the system .",
    "this result was found , first numerically and later analytically , in a class of spin models where important and rigorous results have been obtained during the last century , though generally only in the thermodynamical limit ( total number of microscopic constituents of the system @xmath4 keeping fixed the number density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spatial size of the system and @xmath7 is its spatial embedding dimension ) . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , apparently nobody took care of the dynamics , and consequently nobody spoke of this simple but relevant property .",
    "this dynamical point of view has a few interesting classical consequences .",
    "first of all it explains , from the point of view of microscopic dynamics , the possibility of ferromagnetic behavior in small system . indeed , in absence of external field and external noise ( temperature ) a magnetized system , ( belonging to one branch of the non - connected phase space ) remains magnetized simply because it can not move to the other one .",
    "furthermore , our tnt is surely related to recent results@xcite connecting topological transitions ( tt ) and thermo - statistical phase transitions ( pt ) , even if such investigations again concern the thermodynamical limit only , and they relate to usual pt of canonical thermo - statistics",
    ". however , it has been recently stressed @xcite that microcanonical thermo - statistics is the theoretically more suitable description for systems with small size and/or long - range interactions .",
    "we therefore begin in section [ mechtop ] with a short description of our class of models and the topological properties of the tnt for finite and infinite @xmath8 , pointing out the crucial role played by the first key ingredient of our models , the @xmath9 anisotropy in particular we would like to answer the following question : what happen to the energy @xmath2 and to the corresponding @xmath8-spin configuration @xmath10 when the @xmath4 ? it is exactly answering this question that the deep connection between tnt and the other key ingredient , the long - range interactions , becomes apparent .",
    "our results @xcite can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) for finite sized systems tnt exists for short range and long range as well , as soon as anisotropy persists .",
    "\\2 ) when the number of particles becomes large the energy size of the non - connected region goes to zero with respect to the total energy size for short range interaction while it goes to some finite quantity for long range ones .",
    "in section [ dynthermostat ] we switch to the dynamical properties found in @xcite which accompany such a special ( and rather `` big '' ) tt , and its relations with its thermostatistical properties , namely the occurence and location of a usual ( paramagnetic / ferromagnetic ) pt , using techniques from large deviation theory @xcite within the microcanonical description of the system .",
    "we conclude in [ conclusions ] . everywhere here we restrict ourselves to the classical case ; for a recent discussion of its quantum counterpart , we refer to @xcite .",
    "as a paradigmatic model example of tnt , let us consider the following class of lattice spin models , described by the heisenberg - like hamiltonian :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 are the spin components , assumed to vary continuously ; @xmath13 label the spins positions on a suitable lattice of spatial dimension @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the inter - spin spatial separation therein . here for simplicity",
    "we consider a @xmath15 lattice .",
    "( see @xcite for extensions to @xmath16 . ) for later notational convenience , we define the single - spin vector @xmath17 and the @xmath8-spin configuration @xmath18 .",
    "the tip of each @xmath19-th spin is taken to lie on the unit sphere , i.e. it satisfies the constraint @xmath20 . also , @xmath21 parametrizes the range of interactions ( decreasing range for increasing @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 parametrizes the @xmath9 anisotropy . for @xmath24",
    "we recover nearest - neighbor interactions , while @xmath25 corresponds to infinite - range interactions .",
    "a mean - field model is obtained by setting @xmath25 and including as well the ( somewhat non - physical ) self - interaction pairs @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 while this might be thought of as a negligible modification for @xmath4 , nevertheless it has non - negligible effects concerning the chaoticity properties of the system .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of the truly mean - field @xmath25 system turns out to be exactly integrable@xcite .",
    "here we are not interested in the most general spin hamiltonian giving rise to a tnt ( for instance in @xcite a term containing a transversal magnetic field @xmath29 has been added to @xmath30 ) .",
    "rather , we focus on the very simple hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) which already contains the two essential ingredients which give rise to the tnt , i.e. anisotropy and long - range , whose main effects are conveniently encapsulated within two simple and easy - to - handle parameters @xmath22 and @xmath31 , in order to make the study of the minimum - energy configurations analytically tractable at @xmath4 and numerically feasible at finite @xmath8 . concerning the physical motivations for such choices , we refer to the recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "depending on the specific @xmath8-spin configuration the corresponding energy @xmath32 will vary according to ( [ h ] ) .",
    "one ( not necessarily unique ) configuration @xmath33 , to be specified soon , turns out to have minimum energy @xmath34 , defined by the minimum of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) over all conceivable configurations :    @xmath35\\ .\\ ] ]    since @xmath36 the minimum energy configuration @xmath33 is attained when all spins are aligned along the @xmath37 axis , which defines implicitly the easy axis of magnetization . in the same way ,",
    "let us define the tnt energy @xmath2 as the minimum energy compatible with the constraint of zero magnetization along the easy axis of magnetization :    @xmath38    \\right .. \\ ] ]    corresponding to some other @xmath8-spin configuration @xmath39 to be specified later . by definition , in general @xmath40 , and in particular it may be that @xmath41 .",
    "we call this situation is topological non - connection , as will become clear in a moment , and its physical ( dynamical as well as statistical ) consequences are rather interesting .",
    "indeed , consider a system prepared at time @xmath42 with a definite sign of magnetization , say @xmath43 and an energy value @xmath44 .",
    "as time goes by , the system evolves upon the constant energy surface @xmath45 in configuration space .",
    "nevertheless , due to the continuity of the dynamical equations of motion the magnetization @xmath46 ( not a constant of motion ) may well change its size , but it can never change its sign , instead . indeed , in order to assume a value @xmath47 it should have to go through at least one configuration with @xmath48 , which by definition can not belong to the @xmath49 surface .",
    "the whole situation can be summarized as follows .",
    "_ topology _ : in configuration space the surface at fixed energy @xmath3 is topologically non - connected in two components , each characterized by a magnetization either @xmath50 or @xmath43 .    _",
    "dynamics _ : though the two components are energetically accessible on equal grounds , the ergodicity of the constant @xmath3 surface is trivially broken , since there exist no dynamically allowed path inbetween them .    _",
    "thermo - statistics _ :",
    "de - magnetization is in principle impossible below the tnt , so we may speak in some sense of a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "of course , the application of a magnetic field , or a thermal noise , can give the energy necessary to overcome the energy barrier , thus in principle - if not in practice - allowing for a magnetic reversal .",
    "on the contrary , for energy values @xmath51 , de - magnetization is in principle possible , and we may speak in some sense of a paramagnetic phase . however , being above the tnt does not automatically guarantee that , for any combination of parameter values and initial conditions , a system initially magnetized at @xmath42 will for sure eventually de - magnetize within a given finite observational time @xmath52 .",
    "first , as reported in @xcite some invariant multidimensional structures can appear in phase - space preventing the motion from covering the whole energy surface .",
    "this lack of ergodicity is well known in 2d hamiltonian systems , where kam tori prevent motion from wandering the whole phase space @xcite , while it turns out to be more complicated in multidimensional system , see for instance the famous fermi - pasta - ulam problem ( for interesting reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "such invariant structures usually disappear in the presence of strongly chaotic motions @xcite .",
    "we can therefore say that strong chaos is somehow another necessary ingredient in order for the system to be in its paramagnetic phase .",
    "second , even given strong enough chaoticity to `` encourage '' the system to explore all the available phase ( or configuration ) space , yet the system could be given not enough time to actually do it , so effectively `` freezing '' it within the @xmath53 component where it started from .",
    "for finite @xmath8 systems the @xmath9 anisotropy is the only necessary ingredient in order to have @xmath54 and hence the tnt . for @xmath55 ,",
    "one quickly realizes that @xmath56 and guesses that @xmath57 , but may still wonder wehther @xmath58 as well , thus making the tnt physically irrelevant .",
    "so we define the topological non - connection ratio :    @xmath59    which expresses how large a fraction of the energy range is topologically non - connected . here",
    "we use the denominator @xmath34 ( instead of the whole energy range ) , since , in such kind of models , one is usually interested in the negative energy range only .",
    "correspondingly , we will refer to a system as topologically non - connected if @xmath60 in the limit @xmath55 .    to show why and",
    "how this whole comes by in our models , we now concentrate on the energy @xmath3 of the above mentioned interesting @xmath8-spin configurations .",
    "the minimum - energy configuration @xmath33 ( all spins aligned along the @xmath37-axis ) , can also be thought of as composed of @xmath0 equal blocks of @xmath61 spins , all up .",
    "correspondingly , the minimum energy @xmath62 can be split into 3 contributions , namely @xmath0 equal intra - block bulk energies @xmath63 plus @xmath64 inter - block interaction energy @xmath65 .",
    "flipping just 1 block , its bulk energy does not change , i.e. @xmath66 , but the interaction energy reverses sign to @xmath67 .",
    "however , in such a new configuration @xmath68 the magnetization is now @xmath48 .",
    "both bulk energies are as low as they can , while the constraint @xmath48 frustrates the total energy to rise above @xmath34 by an amount @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath70 as a somewhat obvious candidate for @xmath2 and the related spin configuration @xmath68 as the tnt spin configuration @xmath39 .    , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "only the central part of the chain has been shown . ]",
    "a @xmath15 example of a numerically obtained @xmath68 is given in fig .",
    "[ n100 ] . as one can see , excluding a small central domain , the spins are arranged in two equal - size blocks with opposite spins , i.e. the real @xmath39 is remarkably similar to , though in fact somewhat slightly different from , the ideal @xmath68 .",
    "extensive numerical simulations using constrained optimization and analytical estimates as well@xcite , confirm such an impression , with natural analogues in @xmath16 .",
    "quite generally , the exact tnt configuration at finite @xmath8 for arbitrary @xmath22 and @xmath31 can be found only numerically . nevertheless , concerning the large @xmath8 limit it is possible to make a few definite statements @xcite .",
    "first , if @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath8 sufficiently large , then @xmath75 , in the twofold sense that the tnt spin configuration is approximately half up and half down , and the energy difference @xmath76 due to the domain is a finite quantity independent of @xmath8 .",
    "second , for @xmath4 , if @xmath77 ( short - range ) then @xmath78 but if @xmath79 ( long - range ) then @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath15 then @xmath81 . intuitively , while for short - range the bulk volume contribution @xmath82 eventually dominates over the geometric inte(sur)face area energy interaction @xmath83 , for long - range interactions the `` effective interface '' is the whole bulk as well . as now both the inter - block and the intra - block interaction",
    "involve all spin pairs in the two blocks , though each pair with a different intensity @xmath84 , energies will then scale like the number of pairs @xmath85 times the interaction at typical distance @xmath86 .",
    "so there holds the _",
    "same scaling _",
    "@xmath87 , though with different ( and @xmath22-dependent ) proportionality constants , and so @xmath88 as @xmath55 .",
    "here , we show how to impose a self - consistent hamiltonian dynamical evolution upon the spin systems described by ( [ h ] ) . afterward",
    ", we will employ such dynamical equations , numerically integrated for long enough times , to study the time - evolution of @xmath89 .",
    "following @xcite here we focus on the time evolution instantaneous magnetization @xmath46 started with some @xmath3 and @xmath90 and evolved according to ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "complementarily , we look at its statistical distribution @xmath91 , built via a random sampling of an ensemble of initial conditions , all with the same @xmath3 , tunable at will .",
    "finally , we will show a connection between dynamics and thermo - statistics .    for each @xmath19 the spin components @xmath92",
    "satisfy the usual commutation rules for angular momenta , i.e. @xmath93 , ( and cyclic ) where @xmath94 are the canonical poisson brackets . as usual , ( and this procedure immediately translates to the quantum case @xcite ) , starting from the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) we straightforwardly derive the dynamical equations as :    @xmath95    as is well - known , for such dynamical equations the total energy @xmath3 and the spin moduli @xmath96 are constants of the motion . usually , for energies @xmath3 not too close to @xmath34 , the dynamics is characterized by a positive largest lyapunov exponent , corresponding to strongly chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the dynamics of the truly ( all pairs @xmath97 ) mean - field @xmath25 system turns out to be exactly integrable@xcite .",
    "given strong enough chaoticity , typical examples of evolution curves of @xmath46 and corresponding @xmath91 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ dyn5 ] .     for different specific energy values .",

    "d ) below the tnt ) : @xmath100 .",
    "middle line ( ( b , e ) between the tnt and the statistical thresholds @xmath101 .",
    "lower line ( ( c , f ) above the statistical threshold ) @xmath102 . ]    again , the whole situation can be summarized as follows .    _ thermo - statistics _ : for @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ dyn5]d ) the two peaks of the distribution are well separated , while for @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ dyn5]e ) they come close . at @xmath105",
    "they merge into one single peak ( fig .",
    "[ dyn5]f ) , as expected from the statistical analytical estimate .",
    "note that this simple ( and , in its roots , purely geometrical ) argument immediately prooves that , in general , @xmath106 : excluding catastrophic situations , upon increasing @xmath3 the two separated inner tails must first touch at @xmath2 before the relatively outer twin peaks may eventually merge at @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , this very same argument automatically applies to any model with probability distribution changing from single to double - peaked , e.g. the discrete mean field @xmath107 model @xcite .",
    "in other words , if both a tnt and a pt are known to exist , then in general they will occur at different energies . and depending on wether @xmath3 is increased or decreased , both a tnt and a pt in some sense `` anticipate '' each other .",
    "of course , for a given specific system nothing automatically guarantees that either a tnt or a pt do indeed both exist .",
    "so , while in principle a tnt and a pt neither imply nor exclude each other , in practice they `` strongly suggest '' each other .    _",
    "dynamics _ : at low energy ( a ) the system is always magnetized with small fluctuations , and at high energy ( b ) the system is on average non - magnetized with large fluctuations . in between ( c )",
    "the magnetization jumps erratically up and down .",
    "we can usefully define a magnetic - reversal time - scale @xcite , as the average time necessary to magnetization to reverse its sign . in the presence of strong chaos ( dependent on the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath3 ) magnetic reversals occur fully at random , with the distribution of jumping times following a poisson distribution .",
    "any deviation from such distribution , for large @xmath8 and large negative @xmath3 values , signals the presence of invariant curves preventing the motion to switch from one peak to the other one .    , @xmath98 , and different @xmath8 values as indicated in the insert .",
    "lines are the best fit according to eq .",
    "( [ taurev ] ) . ]",
    "interestingly , and somewhat reminiscent of a critical pt , as shown in fig .",

    "remarkably , such a _ dynamical _ behavior can be qualitatively - and almost quantitatively - explained only by _ statistical _ considerations . before that , let us remark that ( [ taurev ] ) can be inverted for @xmath3 at any fixed @xmath8 , thus giving a @xmath110-depending characteristic energy @xmath111 .",
    "we will see the physical meaning of @xmath112 in a while ; here we just note that , since ( [ taurev ] ) holds only for @xmath51 , it will also be @xmath113 .    _",
    "thermo - statistics _ : restricting attention to the mean field hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) , a detailed statistical analysis using techniques from large deviations theory leads to definite predictions ( see @xcite for details ) concerning the microcanonical ( i.e. , purely state - counting at fixed @xmath3 ) probability distribution @xmath114 , the topological energy threshold @xmath2 , and the thermo - statistical energy threshold @xmath105 , where the system undergoes a continuous ferro / paramagnetic pt in the microcanonical description .",
    "_ dynamics _ : adopting a viewpoint as close as possible to the experimental one , we introduce an observational time @xmath52 , during which the experiment can be performed .",
    "assuming the experimentally measured value and the dynamically observed time - average to coincide , we introduce the @xmath52-averaged magnetization :    @xmath115    the quantity @xmath116 as a function of the energy @xmath3 can be compared with @xmath117 , obtained from the most likely values @xmath118 ( the maxima of the distribution ) .",

    "also , the effective transition given by @xmath116 occurs at some intermediate energy , different from both @xmath2 and @xmath105 .",
    "this is not completely surprising , since both the topological energy @xmath2 and the thermo - statistical energy @xmath105 refer to some limiting properties , the former when @xmath121 at any finite @xmath8 , the latter when @xmath55 at any time @xmath122 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , inverting eq .",
    "( [ taurev ] ) , to the observation time @xmath52 there correspond a dynamical energy @xmath123 which is in fairly good agreement with the observed transition energy , see fig .",
    "[ stat ] .    note also that , to a rather good accuracy @xcite , there holds the following proportionality between the _ dynamical _ quantity @xmath124 and the _ statistical _ quantity @xmath125 :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "theoretically @xcite , this can be traced back to the occurence of an entropy barrier @xmath129 between the two components , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 , under the assumption of markovicity of the dynamical evolution .",
    "detailed statistical consideration on the mean field model ( [ hmf ] ) lead to the analytical estimate @xmath132 to be compared with the numerical result @xmath133 .",
    "heuristically , ( [ taupp ] ) can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose the dynamics is strongly enough chaotic , making the system almost freely wander through configuration space , in some sort of diffusive fashion .",
    "then , the probability to encounter a configuration with @xmath48 , and therefore presumably switch from the @xmath43 to the the @xmath47 component , can be assumed to be simply proportional to the ratio of the number @xmath134 of `` right '' configurations at @xmath48 to the number @xmath135 of `` wrong '' configurations at @xmath136 , but counting only a half of the total wrong ones , namely those on the side where the system is coming from .",
    "( the system can not know nothing yet about the other side still it s going to . )",
    "however , as long as the magnetization peaks are high and narrow , essentially all the `` wrong '' configuration are actually within the peak itself , i.e. normalizing by the total number @xmath137 of energetically allowed configurations gives the probabilities @xmath138 .",
    "finally , the average time needed for magnetic reversal can be assumed to be taken proportional to the probability to encounter the right configuration with @xmath48 , times some characteristic `` residence time '' @xmath139 during which the system essentially stays within each given @xmath8-spin configuration , along its longer wandering of the whole @xmath8-spin configuration space .",
    "altogether , such a purely statistical argument recovers exactly ( [ taupp ] ) , implicitly suggesting that the precise value of @xmath139 might be the origin of the different coefficients found between the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite realizations of the same dynamical evolution equations ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "we showed the existence in classical heisenberg spin models of a topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) , caused by the anisotropy of the coupling when it induces an easy - axis of the magnetization .",
    "below the tnt the constant energy surface is topologically disconnected in two symmetrically equal components .",
    "such a result on the topology has connections both with the dynamics ( time - scales ) and with the thermo - statistics ( pt ) of the system . in each component",
    "the magnetization along the easy axis has a definite sign , and it can not change sign as time goes by , corresponding a ferromagnetic behavior of the system . above the tnt , in a strong chaotic regime , the magnetization reverses its sign with a characteristic time - scale which diverges as a power law at the tnt .",
    "given enough chaos and enough observational time , this leads to a paramagnetic behavior of the system .",
    "moreover , the numerically observed link between time - scales and probability distributions has been given an heuristical justification .",
