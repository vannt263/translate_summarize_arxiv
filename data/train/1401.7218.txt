    "the computation of pair correlation functions ( pcf ) started with the experimental evaluation of the pcf of liquid argon from neutron scattering , see @xcite .",
    "the pcf was then treated in many books as a subject connected to mono - atomic fluids , see @xcite .",
    "the pcf was later applied to the poissonian voronoi tessellation ( pvt ) and the pcf for 2d/3d vertexes was evaluated , see @xcite .",
    "the astronomers started to study the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) as a tool for probing the cosmological distance scale and dark energy , see @xcite .",
    "the astronomical analysis continued with the study of : ( i ) the impact of uncertainties in the photometric redshift error probability distribution on dark energy constraints from the detection of bao in galaxy power spectra , see @xcite , ( ii ) the cosmological distance errors achievable using the bao as a standard ruler , see @xcite , ( iii ) the detectability of bao in the power spectrum of galaxies using ultra large volume @xmath0-body simulations of the hierarchical clustering of dark matter and semi - analytical modeling of galaxy formation , see @xcite , ( iv ) a set of ultra - large particle - mesh simulations of the lyman-@xmath1 forest targeted at understanding the imprint of bao in the inter - galactic medium , see @xcite , ( v ) the use of bao to map the expansion history of the universe , see @xcite , ( vi ) a measure of bao from the angular power spectra of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) data release 8 imaging catalog that includes 872,921 galaxies over 10000 @xmath2 between 0.45 @xmath3 , see @xcite .",
    "this section outlines the difference between pcf in fluids and pcf in astronomy .",
    "the pcf adopted for voronoi diagrams is reviewed .",
    "the pcf gives the probability of finding a pair of objects a distance @xmath4 apart , relative to the probability expected for a random distribution of the same density .",
    "this function can be estimated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the considered volume , @xmath0 is the number of objects , and @xmath7 is the distance between centers , see formula ( 2.94 ) in @xcite .",
    "astronomers , beginning with @xcite , have used the following convention for the pcf for galaxies @xmath8 the most used conventions for low values of @xmath4 assumes that @xmath9 where @xmath10=1.8 and @xmath11 ( the correlation length ) when the range @xmath12 is considered , see @xcite where 118,149 galaxies were analyzed .",
    "another estimator of the pcf useful both for simulations of vertexes of pvt and catalogs of galaxies is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the number of object  object , random  random , and object  random pairs having distance @xmath4 , see @xcite ; in this paper the word object can be substituted by a vertex of a pvt or a galaxy .",
    "the random configuration can be realized every time with a different random number generator . as an example",
    ", we generate @xmath17 different random configurations and we average the different values of @xmath18 which now will be characterized by an error bar given by the standard deviation",
    ".      the pcf for the point process of vertexes in @xmath19 and @xmath20 has been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "a review formula for the pcf is reported in @xcite , see eqn .",
    "( 5.6.2 ) with m=2 ( 2d ) and m=3 ( 3d ) and tables 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 ; as a first analysis we tested the 2d and 3d results with our simulation . in this case",
    "the pcf is computed via the numerical formula ( [ csimio ] ) .",
    "the adopted scale is important and in view of future applications we have chosen the generalized averaged radius , @xmath21 , of the 2d cells as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the side of the square in which @xmath24 seeds are inserted .",
    "the generalized averaged radius in 3d is @xmath25 where @xmath23 is the side of the cube in which @xmath24 seeds are inserted .",
    "the distances will therefore be expressed in normalized units @xmath26 and as an example a normalized distance of 2 corresponds to an averaged diameter .",
    "figures ( [ f01 ] ) and ( [ f02 ] ) report the 2d/3d mathematical pcf as well our simulated one in normalized units .",
    "we are in the presence of a damped oscillatory behavior of the pcf for pvt vertexes and the first minimum is reached when @xmath27 in 2d and @xmath28 in 3d .",
    "this section first reviews the statistical distributions as function of the height from a plane of reference for a system of auto gravitating galaxies and then provides a first astrophysical environment when we have a symmetrical configuration of galaxies in respect to a line ( 2d ) or in respect to a plane ( 3d ) .",
    "the density profile of a thin self - gravitating disk of gas which is characterized by a maxwellian distribution in velocity and a distribution which varies only in the @xmath29-direction is here applied to galaxies , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the galaxy density at @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a scaling parameter in @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the hyperbolic secant ( @xcite ) .",
    "this physical law can be converted to a probability density function ( pdf ) , the probability of having a galaxy at a distance between @xmath29 and @xmath36 from a plane of symmetry @xmath37 the range of existence of this pdf , which is the logistic distribution , is in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , see @xcite .",
    "the average value is @xmath39 and the variance is @xmath40 this pdf can be converted in such a way that it can be compared with the normal ( gaussian ) distribution @xmath41 where @xmath29 is the distance in @xmath34 from the plane of symmetry and @xmath42 the standard deviation in @xmath34 .",
    "the substitution @xmath43 transforms the pdf ( [ sech2prob ] ) into @xmath44 which has variance @xmath45 .",
    "the similarity with the normal distribution is straightforward and figure [ f03 ] reports the two pdfs when the value of @xmath42 is equal in both cases .",
    "we now analyze the astrophysical case in which the galaxies follow the logistic law along a perpendicular direction , @xmath29-axis , to a line along the @xmath46-axis ( 2d ) and are randomly disposed in the @xmath46 direction .",
    "by analogy with the 3d case the galaxies will follow the logistic law in the @xmath29-direction and will be randomly generated in the @xmath47 and @xmath46 directions .",
    "in other words we realize a statistical equilibrium for galaxies with respect to a plane or to a line .",
    "figures [ f04 ] and [ f05 ] report the computation of the 2d/3d pcf with a choice of parameters which give values of @xmath10 and @xmath48 similar to those observed , see eq .",
    "( [ parameterscorre ] ) .",
    "up to now we have expressed all the distances in normalized units in which the unit is the averaged radius of the approximated circles / spheres which approximate the 2d/3d area / volume of a voronoi cell .",
    "a second unit system is obtained multiplying the normalized distance @xmath49 by the averaged radius of the voids , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 ; this can be considered the physical space .",
    "a third unit system is connected with the redshift , @xmath29 , which after @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 , with @xmath54 when @xmath55 is not specified , @xmath56 is the distance in @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the light velocity . in our framework",
    "@xmath59 and this conversion defines the redshift space .",
    "voronoi diagrams can model the local universe once two different calibrations are done .",
    "the first calibration is connected with the averaged effective radius of the voids .",
    "a first analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) r7 catalog , see @xcite , suggests @xmath60 as the averaged effective radius of the voids .",
    "a second analysis of the same catalog finds that the effective radii of the voids range from 5 to 135 mpc / h and a first approximated evaluation gives @xmath61 , see @xcite .",
    "we therefore define an acceptable range of variability for the averaged effective radius of the voids @xmath62 the theoretical averaged radius of the voronoi volumes approximated by spheres should be comprised in this current range of variability ; this is the first calibration",
    ". on adopting a practical point of view @xmath50 will be fixed in such a way that the first minimum of the pcf is at 65 mpc / h .",
    "a second calibration of the voronoi diagrams originates from the pdf which models the statistics of the voids .",
    "a possible model for the observed statistics of the voids volumes as given by sdss r7 is the kiang function , see @xcite , @xmath63 with @xmath64 , see @xcite . due to the fact that the pvt seeds are characterized by @xmath65 in the kiang function we generate @xmath66 seeds , in order to have @xmath64 .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the points of a tessellation in 3d are of four types , depending on how many nearest neighbors in @xmath67 , the ensemble of seeds , they have .",
    "the name seeds derive from their role in generating cells .",
    "basically we have two kinds of seeds , poissonian and non poissonian which generate the poissonian voronoi tessellation ( pvt ) and the non poissonian voronoi tessellation ( npvt ) .",
    "the poissonian seeds are generated independently on the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 axis in 3d through a subroutine which returns a pseudo - random real number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "this is the case most studied and for practical purposes , the subroutine ran2 was used , see @xcite .",
    "the non poissonian seeds can be generated in an infinite number of different ways : some examples of npvt are reported in @xcite , here the seeds are generated in order that the pdf in volumes follows a kiang function with @xmath64 .",
    "the algorithm that generates such seeds is reported in section 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "a point with exactly one nearest neighbor s is in the interior of a cell , a point with two nearest neighbors is on the face between two cells , a point with three nearest neighbors is on an edge shared by three cells , and a point with four neighbors is a vertex where three cells meet . following the nomenclature introduced by @xcite , we call the intersection between a plane and the pvt @xmath71 and @xmath72 the intersection between a plane and the npvt",
    ". a discussion on how to extract the edges in 3d or the faces that in @xmath71 and @xmath72 become lines , can be found in section 4.1 of @xcite .",
    "we now explore two cases : the first case is a 2d cut or @xmath72 on a 3d network which covers few voids and the second one is a cut which covers many voids .",
    "the 3d network of few voids can be visualized through the display of the edges , see figure [ f06 ] .",
    "we now consider a 2d cut or @xmath72 on the 3d npvt network of faces , see figure [ f07 ] .",
    "we now compute the probability of having a galaxy according to the logistic law , see eq .",
    "( [ sech2variance ] ) , in the previous plane where @xmath29 is the distance from a face which in the 2d cut or @xmath72 is a line .",

    "figure [ f09 ] displays the pcf for large values of @xmath4 and figure [ f10 ] the pcf for the full range of @xmath4 ; the first minimum exists but is not well defined .",
    "we start with a 3d box of @xmath73 600 @xmath74 a side and we produce a 2d cut which is made by irregular polygons . on this 2d backbone",
    "we select 30,000 galaxies , see figure  [ f11 ] .",
    "we then compute the 2d pcf and the results is reported in figure [ f12 ] together with the results of the pcf for 2dfvl , which is a nearly vl sample from 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , see @xcite .",
    "our local minimum is at 65.17 mpc / h and that of figure 3 ( red line ) in @xcite at 65 mpc / h .",
    "we now outline the differences between our approach and the usual model adopted by the astronomers .",
    "the model here adopted is based on the pcf of the vertexes of pvt which is developed in a 2d/3d euclidean space .",
    "the standard approach to bao conversely uses one of the 14 cosmological models available at the moment , see @xcite . in the standard approach the first minimum going from the left to the right is reached at @xmath75 .",
    "this observational fact allows us to derive @xmath50 in our model .",
    "the same approximations are made in the void finding algorithms applied to galaxy survey data , which often use the spheres approximation , see @xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid when the thickness of the surface which contains the galaxies , @xmath42 according to eqn .",
    "( [ sech2variance ] ) , is smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "a theoretical explanation for the variability of the averaged radius of the cosmic voids is perhaps due to the absence of analytical results for the @xmath71 problem .",
