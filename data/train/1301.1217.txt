    "large data from recent galaxy redshift surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "the upcoming deep and wide - area galaxy surveys , e.g. , subaru hyper suprime - cam survey and dark energy survey , will provide even larger data of distant galaxies . clearly , accurate theoretical models are needed to interpret observational results such as those on the relationship between galaxies and dark matter ( dm ) halos .",
    "so far , several useful phenomenological methods to link halos with galaxies have been developed .",

    "however , it is known that one often encounters difficulty in fitting hod model predictions to the observed clustering and the number density simultaneously @xcite .",

    "sham assumes a tight relation between galaxy luminosity ( or stellar mass ) and subhalo circular velocity ( or mass ) .",
    "the threshold circular velocity is set such that the number density of subhalos and that of luminosity - selected galaxies are matched as @xmath1 the predicted clustering generally agrees with observations , reproducing the observed luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering .",
    "it should be emphasized that sham does not need fitting parameters while hod modeling does",
    ". an additional advantage of sham is that it can utilize @xmath0-body simulation outputs directly .",
    "therefore , sham can incorporate the non - linear evolution of galaxy clustering accurately while having a simple and direct galaxy - subhalo connection .",
    "both the hod model and sham are used to calculate the galaxy two - point correlation or the galaxy - mass cross correlation as a function of a galaxy property , e.g. , luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "it would be ideal if multiple observable properties are assigned simultaneously to ( sub)halos .",
    "galaxy color is one of the most fundamental properties .",
    "it is thought to indicate the galaxy s age and the level of star formation activity .",
    "also it is well - known that there are two apparent sequences in the color - magnitude diagram , which represent red and blue galaxies .",
    "the two populations differ in many aspects including their spatial clustering , reflecting probably their formation histories .",
    "so far , detailed treatments for color - dependent clusterings or lensing measurements have been developed , but within the hod model @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop a method to assign galaxy color to subhalos by extending sham .",
    "we first apply sham to a subhalo catalog to obtain luminosity - selected subhalo samples .",
    "we then divide into two groups by ordering subhalos using a secondary quantity .",
    "the two groups are then meant to represent red and blue galaxy samples .",
    "similarly to the original sham , the abundance ratio of the divided two groups is matched to the observed red / blue ratio . clearly , we need to choose an appropriate subhalo property which is presumably correlated with galaxy color .",
    "we propose two models for the secondary property .",
    "one is motivated by the so - called assembly bias whereas the other incorporates environment effects .",
    "assembly bias is a property - dependent bias for halos in a fixed mass bin .",
    "a variety of properties have been considered so far , such as assembly time , spin , concentration and so on ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we choose subahlo age as a proxy of galaxy color .",
    "it is thought that there are some environmental effects through which a galaxy s morphology and color evolve .",
    "@xcite recently developed a model to assign color to subhalos ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "is assigned to subhalos by using local galaxy density along with the empirical color - galaxy density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our second model is similar to the method in @xcite , although we do not use such an empirical relation .",
    "we consider lensing measurements in addition to galaxy clusterings in order to distinguish the two models .",
    "lensing observations will provide an independent information which possibly allows us to derive an accurate galaxy - halo connection .",
    "in particular , we utilize the observed early / late - type dependent lensing profile @xcite assuming early / late - type galaxies approximately correspond to red / blue galaxies .",
    "we show , for the first time , that an extended sham can reproduce the observed lensing profiles as well as the color - dependent galaxy clusterings in the local universe    the rest of the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe our cosmological @xmath0-body simulations and the basics of sham . in section 3 , we explain our method of galaxy color assignment . then in section 4 , we compare the model predictions for color dependent galaxy clustering and galaxy - mass cross correlations with the observational results and present the results for the impacts of scatter in the local dm density - color relations .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "we use the massively parallelized code _ gadget-2 _ @xcite in its tree - pm mode to run two cosmological @xmath0-body simulations . for each run , the assumed @xmath2-cold - dm cosmology is consistent with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ 7-year results , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the standard notation @xcite .",
    "the two runs , one with @xmath5 on a side and the other with @xmath6 box size , both employ @xmath7 dm particles , and are referred to as l200 and l300 , respectively .",
    "the resulting mass of a particle is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) for the l200 ( l300 ) run .",
    "we use the code _ camb _ @xcite to obtain the matter power spectrum for the initial condition .",
    "we set the initial redshift to be 49 ( 65 ) for the l200 ( l300 ) run .",
    "the gravitational softening length is set to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the l200 and the l300 run , respectively .",
    "the l300 run has lower mass and spatial resolution than the l200 run but provides higher statistical precision of correlation functions for massive objects and at the large scale .",
    "we identify the distinct halos , i.e. , halos that do not lie in more massive halos , using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the linking parameter of 0.2 in units of the mean interparticle separation .",
    "for the identification of subhalos , i.e. , dense self - gravitating clumps that reside in a distinct halo , we utilize the _ subfind _ algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the algorithm decomposes a distinct halo into a central subhalo , i.e. , the so - called smooth component which contains the majority of mass , and satellite subhalos .",
    "we store the subhalos with more than 20 particles .    to implement sham",
    ", we construct the subhalo catalog with @xmath12 for the satellite subhalos , where @xmath12 is the maximum value of particle circular velocity @xmath13 at the last epoch when the satellite subhalo was a central one @xcite .",
    "we follow the recipe described in detail by @xcite to construct the mass assembly history of the most massive progenitor of subhalos .",
    "we use 50 simulation snapshots taken evenly in @xmath14 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 for the two simulations . for the central subhalos , we tabulate the maximum circular velocity at the redshift when they are _ observed _ , @xmath17 .",
    "then the term @xmath18 in equation ( [ sham ] ) is replaced with @xmath17 for the central subhalos and @xmath12 for the satellite subhalos .",
    "note that the circular velocity defined in this way is a direct proxy of gravitational potential , and is less sensitive to subhalo identification algorithms than is the subhalo mass .",
    "following @xcite , we consider in three magnitude bins , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and hereafter denote the absolute magnitude just as @xmath21 without the @xmath22 term .",
    "we apply sham to the subhalo catalogs constructed in the l200 and l300 runs to create the magnitude - binned subhalo samples .",
    "we take the bracketing threshold samples for a bin and then use the difference of them as a binned sample . the comoving number density for each threshold sample",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "we measure the projected correlation function @xmath23 as a function of the projected distance @xmath24 as @xmath25 we take the same value of @xmath26 used by @xcite for each bin . for the fainter and the intermediate samples we use the l200 subhalo catalog at @xmath16 . only for the brighter sample",

    "we found that sham overpredicts the amplitude for the brightest sample by about 10% at all scales",
    ". this may be because we do not include scatter in the @xmath28 relation . in reality , scatter between the two quantities is expected .",
    "it has been pointed out that introducing scatter reduces the clustering amplitude , in particular for the brighter sample effectively , and makes the agreement better @xcite .",
    "we show the hods obtained for each binned sample in the bottom panel and compare them with the best - fit hod modeling results estimated by @xcite .",
    "we consider the galaxies assigned to the central and satellite subhalos as the central and satellite galaxies , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that the hods of central galaxies from sham are narrower than the hod modeling for the bright and intermediate samples .",
    "it should be noted that both hod modeling and sham give very similar predictions for galaxy clustering .",
    "here we describe our method to assign galaxy color to subhalos .",
    "sham uses the abundance as a function of subhalo and galaxy properties to match their number densities .",
    "sham works well if the properties , e.g. , galaxy luminosity and the subhalo maximum circular velocity , highly correlate with each other @xcite .",
    "the spirit of our method is based on this insight .",
    "we separate each luminosity - binned subhalo catalog into two groups by a secondary subhalo property .",
    "the secondary property is expected to be correlated well with galaxy color .",
    "then the two groups correspond to the red and blue galaxies within the luminosity bin . in a similar fashion to sham ,",
    "the number density ratio of the two subhalo groups is matched with the observed red / blue galaxy abundance ratio .",
    "we study two models for the secondary subhalo property : one is motivated by assembly bias ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the other incorporates environment in and around subhalos .",
    "we discuss our two models below .",
    "it is naive but natural to consider that the galaxy color is a proxy of the galaxy age and to expect that subhalo age is highly correlated with the age of the galaxy .",
    "we use the redshift evolution of the maximum circular velocity to define the formation epoch @xmath29 of subhalos via @xmath30 where @xmath31 on the right hand side is @xmath12 for the satellite subhalos and @xmath17 for the central subhalos at @xmath16 or @xmath32 , depending on the simulation box note that @xmath29 of the satellite subhalos is defined at an earlier epoch than the accretion epoch . in practice , we identify the two snapshots between which @xmath33 is located and then we interpolate linearly between them to get @xmath29 . for low mass subhalos or small values of @xmath34 , we can not follow down to @xmath33 due to the lack of mass resolution in such cases , we define the redshift at which the subhalo is identified for the first time as @xmath29 .",

    "for such @xmath34 , the formation epochs of almost all subhalos are identified later than the first identified epoch even for the faint sample .",
    "] we refer to this model as the _ age model_. in this model , the subhalos with higher @xmath29 correspond to redder galaxies .",
    "it has been shown extensively in the literature that the older distinct halos are more clustered than the younger ones @xcite .",
    "the choice of value of @xmath34 is not unique .",
    "we find that the predicted correlation function depends on the value of @xmath34 .",

    "the red and the blue lines represent @xmath23 or hod for the subhalos with higher- and lower-@xmath29 , respectively . as we expect , a `` split '' like the red / blue galaxy separation is seen in the correlation function ( top panel ) .",
    "furthermore , a larger value of @xmath34 gives larger split .",
    "this can be understood as a larger @xmath34 value captures subhalos which formed at earlier epoch .",
    "hence the predicted clustering for red galaxies is more enhanced .[multiblock footnote omitted ] in the bottom panel , hods are shown .",
    "the peaks at @xmath37 are hods of central galaxies and the power law - like curves at high halo mass regime are hods of satellite galaxies .",
    "it can be seen that the satellite hod is more sensitive to @xmath34 than the central hod .      as our second model",
    ", we adopt the local dm density around subhalos as the secondary subhalo property .",
    "@xcite showed that early type galaxies have higher mass density profile than late type ones at @xmath38 in several magnitude bins via galaxy - galaxy lensing techniques .",
    "in particular , this morphology dependence of mass density profile is more apparent at @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests that redder galaxies tend to be hosted by subhalos with higher density envelope than bluer ones .",
    "we take a sphere with radius of @xmath40 centered on the center of a subhalo to measure the local dm density . in this model",
    ", the subhalos with higher local density corresponds to the redder galaxy populations .",
    "we take the sphere radius of @xmath41 to reflect our motivation from the lensing study .",
    "it should be noted that this property is less affected by simulation resolution than the age model .",
    "we refer to this model as the _ local density model_.    similar to the age model , we find that the predicted correlation function depends on the size of sphere @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ wp_hod_loc ] illustrates the impact of @xmath40 in the local density model .",
    "but for the local density model .",

    "again , the predictions for the @xmath45 sample are shown .",
    "the red and the blue lines are @xmath23 or hod for the subhalos with higher and lower local dm density , respectively .",
    "the top panel shows that clustering amplitudes for the subhalos with higher local density are higher than those for the subhalos with lower density as we expect .",
    "the panel also shows that the color split is larger for larger-@xmath40 .",
    "these are because that counting simulation particles in a sphere with radius of @xmath46 leads subhalos in massive halos ( i.e. , cluster- or group - sized halos ) to be ones with higher local density .",
    "this trend is more effective for larger-@xmath40 as shown in the hod ( see the bottom panel ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows that the red central galaxies are assigned to higher mass distinct halos than the blue central galaxies .",
    "this is because that our local density measure strongly traces subhalo mass or host distinct halo mass itself for central subhalos .",
    "we compare our model predictions for the color dependence of clustering with the observational results by @xcite .",
    "they separated the red and blue galaxies in the @xmath47 color - magnitude space with the division of @xmath48 for each magnitude bin , we search the model with the lowest value of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are chi - square values for fits to the red and the blue galaxy correlation functions .    in the age model , we consider            lines with error bars represent the predicted @xmath23 for the red and the blue galaxies , respectively .",

    "as shown in figure [ wp_age ] , our age model reproduces the observed color - dependent clusterings very well .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is relatively high but not surprising since the time evolution of the maximum circular velocity is slower than mass evolution . for the milky - way sized distinct halo , @xmath29 with @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath53 on average @xcite . in table",

    "it should be noted that the local density model is motivated by the observed lensing profiles .",
    "however the local density model systematically does not have enough clustering amplitude at the smallest scale , @xmath56 , for blue galaxies .",
    "it is because that the local density model populates less massive subhalos with more blue central galaxies than the age model does .",

    "the primary difference is found in hods of central galaxies . by construction , the host halo mass range of central is same in the two models . in the local density model , central blue galaxies",
    "are hosted by low mass distinct halos which have few satellite ones .",
    "we here compare our two models .",
    "the most apparent difference between them is the clustering amplitude of blue galaxies at the smallest scale .",
    "systematic suppression of clustering amplitude can be found in the local density model . at such scale ,",
    "clustering is dominated by signals from central - satellite pairs . as shown in figure [ hod_col ] , the local density model assigns the central blue galaxies to lower mass halos than the age model does whereas satellite galaxies live in more massive halos .",
    "it means that the number of distinct halos with a central blue galaxy and more than one satellite blue satellites is decreased .",
    "this suppresses the clustering amplitude at the small scale .",
    "@xcite calculated correlation functions analytically with the model hods .",
    "their assumed hods of red and blue galaxies have the same form but different amplitudes .",
    "they also obtained very good agreement for both red and blue samples .",
    "however our two models do not agree exactly with their hod forms though both reproduce the observed correlation functions well .",
    "we have shown that both the age and the local density models can be tuned to reproduce the observed color dependence of projected correlation functions reasonably well .",
    "to discuss which model is better to assign galaxy color , we here consider the galaxy - galaxy lensing measurement @xmath57 as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the surface mass density , @xmath60 is the tangential shear and @xmath61 is the critical surface density ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the parameter frac_dev specifies the galaxy flux profile as @xmath66(de vaucouleurs profile)@xmath67(exponential profile ) . as the _ zeroth order approximation _ , we regard early ( late ) type galaxies as red ( blue ) ones . using the sdss dr7 @xcite , we checked that 74% of early ( 89% of late ) type galaxies actually lie in the red ( blue ) sequence for @xmath45 .",
    "for the fainter ( brighter ) sample , these rates are 78 ( 74 ) % and 85 ( 91 ) % for early - red and late - blue correspondences .",
    "therefore the early ( late ) type samples primarily consist of red ( blue ) galaxies . again , the red / blue galaxies are separated via equation ( [ divider ] ) .",

    "we see that @xmath73 of red galaxies is always greater than that of blue galaxies in both the age and the local density models .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the model predicted lensing profiles of red galaxies have higher amplitude than those of blue galaxies at all scales .",
    "also in the local density model , @xmath74 of red galaxies is greater than that of blue galaxies .",
    "however in the age model , @xmath74 of blue galaxies is more massive than that of red galaxies .",
    "this trend can be found in hods of central galaxies from the age model ( see figure [ hod_col ] ) .",
    "this is because more massive halos have more rapid mass growth on average ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , with our definition of the subhalo formation epoch , more massive subhalos tend to be blue galaxies in our age model .",
    "thus the resulting low ( high ) mass of host subhalos of red ( blue ) galaxies in the age model would make the color split of the lensing profiles smaller than in the local density model even at @xmath78 .    to discuss further , we comparison with the observation of @xcite .",
    "we match the red / blue fraction of our simulated galaxies in a magnitude bin to the fraction we obtain from the actual sdss galaxy catalog for the early / late type sample . to this end , we blend the red / blue galaxies randomly .",

    "however the agreement is less impressive for the age model subhalo samples , as can be seen in figure [ del_age ] .",
    "this implies that the local dm density is more crucial for the galaxy color assignment model than the subhalo formation epoch defined via equation ( [ zform ] ) .    by comparing the observed color dependence of clustering and mass profile",
    ", our local dm density model can be regarded as the better model to assign galaxy color to dm subhalos . however reproducing the clustering amplitude of the blue galaxies at @xmath80 remains a challenge for our model .",
    "it is due to that the model traces the dm halo mass too strongly ( see section [ sec : hod ] ) .",
    "it can be expected that introducing scatter in the local dm density - color relation has an impact on the small scale clustering amplitudes .",
    "we here study how much the inclusion of scatter improves the agreement with the sdss measurements .",
    "we adopt a very simple approach to introduce scatter .",
    "we perturb the local dm density @xmath81 measured in the sphere of @xmath40 as follows . for each subhalo ,",
    "logarithm of the perturbed local density @xmath82 is drawn from the gaussian distribution with @xmath83 for @xmath84 , we take @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we adopt these four values for the six sphere sizes of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , i.e. , we have twenty - four combinations of @xmath84 and @xmath40 .",
    "we divide the luminosity binned subhalo catalog into the color binned subsamples according to the ranking of the perturbed local dm density @xmath82 rather than that of the originally measured density @xmath81 .",
    "then we search for the best model among the twenty - four models to recover the observed color dependences of galaxy correlation functions .",
    "we find that , for larger @xmath84 , the split of the projected red and blue correlation functions is smaller .",
    "this is just because introducing scatter is similar to averaging the original red and blue galaxy distributions in the no - scatter model .",
    "hence the best sphere size for the scatter model would be larger than what we obtained for the no - scatter model since the color split is larger for larger @xmath40 ( see figure [ wp_hod_loc ] ) .    here",

    "the halo center is defined to be the density maximum of its smooth component .",

    "the error bars are computed assuming poisson statistics . note",
    "that the two scatter models give very similar chi - square values for the correlation functions in the finer color bins .",
    "the grey box shows very crudely the results by @xcite.,width=321 ]    the figure shows that the no - scatter model predicts the unnatural fraction values of unity at @xmath109 .",
    "this is just because that the no - scatter model simply paints subhalos in high density regions red . on the other hand ,",
    "the two scatter models give more moderate values at @xmath110 since introducing scatter softens the local density - color relation .",
    "moreover the results from the scatter models with @xmath107,~\\sigma_{\\rm p})=(500,~0.2)$ ] and @xmath108 show distinguishable differences among them at @xmath110 .",
    "the former model predicts values of @xmath111 and a flat feature while the latter one s profile has lower values and is decreasing for increasing @xmath112 . it should be noted that the chi - square values from the two scatter models for the projected correlation functions in the finer color bins are very similar : the model with @xmath103 and @xmath102 gives @xmath101 and the other does @xmath113 .",
    "this relatively strong dependence of the red fraction profile on the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath84 is due to the fact that the red fraction profile is similar to the relative bias of red and blue galaxies in the one - halo term regime .",
    "the relative bias enhances the small dependences of galaxy correlation functions in color bins on the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath84 .",
    "hence , as well as correlation functions and lensing profiles , the red fraction profiles in galaxy groups and clusters would be an important clue to study the subhalo property - galaxy color relations .",
    "the grey box in figure [ red_frac ] shows approximately the red fraction profile measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified clusters by richness and measured the red fractions for galaxies with @xmath114 in bins of richness , where @xmath115 is the @xmath63-band luminosity k - corrected to @xmath116 .",
    "they showed that red fraction profiles in very rich clusters have higher values than those in poor ones .",
    "they also found that the red fraction is correlated with cluster richness for poor clusters with richness within @xmath105 of @xmath117 , but is independent of richness for richer systems .",
    "hence the height of the grey box in the figure stands for the richness dependence of the red fraction .",
    "the figure shows that the red fraction from the scatter model with @xmath118 and @xmath90 is within the observational results .",
    "since the galaxy sample used by @xcite is not same as @xcite , and we do not follow cluster classification in @xcite , we here can not discuss consistency between our model predictions and the observed fraction quantitatively as we did for correlation functions .",
    "clearly it is important to study galaxy evolution and its correlation with dm structure evolution with several different observational measurements .",
    "we have extended the subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) to develop a new scheme that assigns galaxy color as well as luminosity to subhalos .",
    "we consider the subhalo age and the local density as a secondary subhalo property which is expected to be correlated with galaxy color . technically , we divide a magnitude - binned subhalo catalog obtained by sham into two samples by the secondary property .",
    "the two samples are then meant to represent red galaxies and blue ones . in a similar fashion to sham",
    ", the abundance ratio of the red and blue galaxies is matched to the observed ratio .",
    "we have studied the spatial clustering of the red and blue galaxies based on the subhalo age model and the local density model .",
    "overall , the two models reproduce the observed color - dependent galaxy clustering properties @xcite reasonably well .",
    "it is encouraging that sham can be extended successfully in this way by using a secondary subhalo property that can be easily measured .",
    "we have examined a few other subhalo properties as an alternative proxy for galaxy color , for instance , the density concentration and the spin parameter .",
    "we have also tried with slightly different definitions for the concentration , spin , age and local dm density .",
    "none of them yields better agreement with the observed correlation functions .",
    "we thus conclude that our original age model and the local density model are the best among those we have examined .",
    "it is worth discussing further the success of our local density model .",
    "one can naively expect that galaxies in higher density environment formed earlier and that they are not forming stars actively any more .",
    "thus the local matter density could be related to the galaxy color . the local dm density around a subhalo within @xmath119-order sphere closely trace the subhalo mass .",
    "then the subhalo mass itself could be used as a proxy for the galaxy color rather than the local density .",
    "we can test the idea by using the subhalo masses determined by the _ subfind _",
    "algorithm at the observation time . in this model ,",
    "more ( less ) massive subhalos correspond simply to redder ( bluer ) galaxies similarly to the local density model .",
    "we have run the same calculations in the previous sections . because subhalos in a massive distinct halo typically have small masses , owing to tidal mass stripping , they tend to be assigned a blue galaxy in this model",
    ". the subhalo mass model does not reproduce at all the observed color - dependent clustering .",
    "indeed , the selected blue galaxies show strong clustering at all length scales .",
    "we argue that some environmental effect , in terms of local density , is important for color assignment for the satellite galaxies .",
    "it is crucial to test our model predictions against not only spatial clustering but also other measurement(s ) .",
    "we propose to use the color dependence of lensing profile , motivated by the observed morphology dependence @xcite . to this end , we regard the early ( late ) types as the red ( blue ) galaxies and calculate the lensing profiles for the two populations .",
    "the predictions from our two models agree with the observed red galaxy lensing profile reasonably well .",
    "in particular the local density model reproduces the observed lensing profile for the blue ( late type ) galaxies .",
    "however , while the local density model shows a large color ( morphology ) split at @xmath71 , the age model does not account for the low amplitude of the lensing profiles of the late ( blue ) galaxies with @xmath45 and @xmath68 at @xmath120 at all .",
    "the fact that the age model does not reproduce the observed color ( morphology ) dependence of lensing profiles might indicate that galaxy color and subhalo age are not tightly correlated with each other .",
    "there is an observational hint for this notion .",
    "@xcite studied the fraction of central galaxies that are not forming stars actively ( `` quenched centrals '' ) as a function of the local galaxy density using a sdss group catalog .",
    "they show that the fraction of passive galaxies does not agree with the fraction of old halos , in particular for relatively small galaxies with @xmath121<10 $ ] .",
    "their findings are qualitatively consistent with our result .",
    "there is not a tight relation between the galaxy color and the age of the host ( sub)halo , or one may need to devise a rather complex conversion from one to the other .",
    "we can think of using the subhalo assembly history of red and blue galaxies directly obtained from @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "further studies are clearly needed .",
    "the abundance matching is a powerful technique to populate a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation with galaxies .",
    "it is encouraging that our simple models reproduce the observed color - dependent clustering well .",
    "there are a variety of choices of the secondary subhalo property as a proxy of galaxy color , and thus it is important to test models using other observations independent of spatial clustering , as we have done in the present paper .",
