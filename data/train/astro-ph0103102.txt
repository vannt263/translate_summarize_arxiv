    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are dark - matter dominated galaxies where the stellar populations only make a small contribution to the observed rotation curves .",
    "it is therefore straight - forward to compare the observed rotation curves of these galaxies with those derived from numerical cosmological simulations , where the dark matter is the dominant component .",
    "early observation of dwarf and lsb galaxies showed that their rotation curves rose less steeply than predicted by numerical simulations based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) hypothesis @xcite . in the cdm model",
    ", halos are characterised by a steep central cuspy power - law mass density distribution @xmath0 .",
    "initial simulations indicated that @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recent results indicate a more extreme value @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies , however , show a more solid - body - like rise consistent with a mass distribution dominated by a central constant - density core ( @xmath9 ) , and hence are inconsistent with the cdm predictions .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by @xcite and @xcite for high surface brightness disk galaxies .",
    "the conclusions regarding lsb galaxies were based on hi  observations with limited spatial resolution , and the data were in part affected by beam smearing . even though @xcite showed that the steep signatures of the rotation curves implied by cdm could not be hidden by any reasonable amount of beam smearing",
    ", there were later suggestions that the observed data _ were _ consistent with the cdm predictions if proper beam smearing corrections were applied .",
    "@xcite published optical rotation curves of five lsb galaxies from the @xcite sample and found that in several cases the inner rotation curve slopes were somewhat steeper than found from the hi  curves .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the data could be reconciled with cdm models once beam smearing corrections are properly taken into account .",
    "this is not borne out by improved data , as we show in this letter .",
    "@xcite ( mrdb ) , @xcite ( dbmr ) and @xcite present high - resolution hybrid h@xmath1/hi rotation curves of lsb galaxies , and show that a large fraction of them are characterised by a slow , solid - body - like rise .",
    "they compare ( cuspy ) cdm nfw halos @xcite and pseudo - isothermal ( core - dominated ) halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the data and find that the pseudo - isothermal model is statistically a much better fit to the data .",
    "most nfw model fits suffer from systematic effects resulting from the fitting program trying to reconcile @xmath10 data with a steep @xmath11 prediction .",
    "the discrepancies between hi  and optical data are found to be less severe than initially suggested in @xcite : there is reasonable agreement between new optical data and the old hi  curves in the majority of the cases ( mrdb ) . the main conclusion drawn from the new data is that lsb galaxies can not be well fitted by cdm rotation curves .",
    "here we derive the mass density profiles that are required to give rise to the observed rotation curves .",
    "these can be compared directly to those predicted by theoretical models .",
    "we use the sample of lsb and dwarf galaxy rotation curves described in dbmr , mrdb and @xcite .",
    "this sample includes the five lsb galaxies originally presented in @xcite that were re - derived in dbmr . to this",
    "we have added the 4 lsb galaxies from the ursa major sample of @xcite with @xmath12 mag arcsec@xmath13 with reliable hi  rotation curves .",
    "in principle , one can invert an observed rotation curve to determine the parent mass distribution . in practice , this procedure can be unstable for thin disks ( but see @xcite ) . for lsb galaxies ,",
    "the disk component is negligible since the potential is dominated by the dark matter halo .",
    "we therefore invert the observed rotation curves assuming a spherical mass distribution , which is a straightforward and robust procedure . from @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 one can derive the mass density @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rotation velocity and @xmath19 is the radius .",
    "implicit in this procedures are assumptions : that these galaxies are all dark matter dominated , that the gas motions are circular in a planar disk and that the spectrum samples the nucleus and major axis .",
    "we also assume that the galaxies are symmetric .",
    "( the latter is a good assumption : mrdb , dbmr and @xcite omitted asymmetric galaxies from the samples , whereas the effects of any mild , residual asymmetries were incorporated in the errorbars . )    here we ignore mass contributions of the stellar and gas components .",
    "as long as these do not dominate the dynamics , as is the case in lsb galaxies , this `` minimum disk '' assumption is a good one .",
    "a minimum disk also produces an upper limit on the steepness of the halo profile as inclusion of gas and stars will tend to flatten the derived slopes .",
    "see also dbmr and @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we show the results for non - minimum disk hypotheses , which are not substantially different from the ones derived here .",
    "figure  [ rho_min ] shows the derived mass density profiles .",
    "over - plotted are the profiles of the best fitting pseudo - isothermal and nfw halo as listed in dbmr and @xcite .",
    "the errors on the data points are derived by rigorously carrying through the errors in the rotation curve data points .",
    "the arrows indicate the size of the seeing disk for each galaxy .",
    "( for the 4 verheijen 1997 galaxies we indicate the radio beam size . )",
    "the shape of the mass density profiles can generally be characterised by two components : an outer one with an isothermal slope of @xmath20 and a more shallow one in the inner parts . after determining the `` break - radius '' where the slope changes most rapidly",
    ", we determine the slope of the inner component using a weighted least - squares fit . table  [ tab : minslopes ] collects the values of the inner slope .",
    "the range over which the power - law is fitted is indicated by the range over which the fit is drawn in fig .",
    "[ rho_min ] . the uncertainty @xmath21 is determined by re - measuring the slope twice , once by including the first data point outside the break - radius , and once by omitting the data point at the break - radius .",
    "the maximum difference between these two values and the original slope is adopted as the uncertainty .",
    "the isothermal mass model generally follows the derived mass profile very well .",
    "the nfw models usually fail dramatically in the inner parts . for the galaxies ,",
    "the signature of the shallow inner slope is usually already present well outside the seeing disk .",
    "optical `` beam smearing '' can therefore not cause these shallow inner slopes .",
    "minimum disk does provide relevant limits on the inner slopes as is particularly well illustrated by ugc 6614 .",
    "this is a bulge - dominated giant lsb galaxy , and we expect the bulge to contribute significantly to the dynamics at small radius for any plausible stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "however , even in the minimum disk case we find a shallow slope @xmath22 .",
    "this means that for any non - minimum disk situation the dark matter must be depressed even further away from the nfw case ( i.e.  the true slope must be even flatter ) .",
    "values for the inner slopes ( fig .",
    "[ rho_min_hist ] ) are asymmetric . in fig .",
    "[ rho_min_hist ] we have distinguished between galaxies where the profile is well - resolved and those where the turn - over in the profile occurs at or within the seeing radius .",
    "the most unresolved galaxies tend to have the most negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "the resolved galaxies define a well - determined peak at @xmath23 that is inconsistent with cdm predictions that @xmath8 .",
    "one possible point of concern is the wing of steeper slopes extending to @xmath24 , where the extreme values originate from the @xcite uma lsb profiles .",
    "does this mean that despite all of the above , there are lsb galaxies that _ can _ be well fitted with cdm models ? and does the tendency of the uma lsb galaxies to have steep slopes indicate systematic effects in the new lsb data ?",
    "the answer to both questions is negative , as the following analysis shows .",
    "table  [ tab : minslopes ] lists the radius in kpc , @xmath25 , of the innermost data point of each profile . for the lsb sample",
    "generally @xmath26 kpc . for the uma galaxies we find larger @xmath25 : three of the four have @xmath27 kpc . in fig .",
    "[ sloperadius_min ] , we plot the values of @xmath25 versus the inner slope @xmath1 . also drawn are the logarithmic slopes as a function of radius for pseudo - isothermal halos with core - radii @xmath28 kpc , as well as a nfw model and a cdm @xmath29 model ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , both of the latter converging to a slope @xmath30 in the ( far ) outer parts .",
    "these two models are chosen to have parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 km s@xmath33 to approximately match the four uma galaxies . however , this choice is not critical .",
    "galaxies with small values of @xmath25 ( @xmath34 kpc ) show clear evidence of a core ( @xmath9 ) , whereas galaxies with larger values of @xmath25 exhibit steeper slopes .",
    "[ sloperadius_min ] shows that distribution is consistent with an isothermal halo with a core radius of a few kpc , whereas the nfw and cdm models do not match the data at all .",
    "hence , only galaxies with small values of @xmath25 measure the core .",
    "larger values sample a transition zone where the slope is changing from @xmath35 ( center ) to @xmath36 ( outer isothermal regions ) . in the zone between @xmath6 and @xmath37",
    "kpc the slopes of the pseudo - isothermal and cdm models are approximately equal , so large values of @xmath25 might erroneously lead to the conclusion that measured slopes are consistent with cdm .",
    "the four uma galaxies ( and some lsb galaxies ) have @xmath25 in this transition zone and thus show steep slopes .",
    "we have modelled the beam smearing or seeing effects potentially present in the optical data ( discussed in a forthcoming paper ) and find that we can strongly exclude the possibility that these affect the results down to resolutions of @xmath38 .",
    "we thus predict that higher spatial resolution data ( with smaller values of @xmath25 ) will also detect cores in the less well - resolved galaxies .",
    "similar arguments apply to the beam smearing corrected hi  curves in van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and van den bosch & swaters ( 2000 ) . with values @xmath39 kpc these data trace",
    "_ not _ the inner slope but instead the steep slope at the turnover of the constant - density core .",
    "mass density profiles of lsb galaxies exhibit inner slopes that are best described by a power - law @xmath0 with @xmath40 .",
    "this result implies that halos of lsb galaxies are dominated by cores .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the value @xmath41 predicted by cdm models .",
    "the steep slopes found for some lsb galaxies arise when the innermost data point is sampling the transition region between core and outer @xmath36 isothermal region , not the core itself .",
    "our data are not consistent with cdm predictions , but suggest that lsb galaxies have halos which contain cores of radii of order 1 kpc .",
