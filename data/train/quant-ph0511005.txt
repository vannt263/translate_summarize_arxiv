    "the study of quantum vacuum in modern physics is crucial due to its profound implications over a broad range of lengthscales , from elementary particle physics and quantum field theory @xcite to cosmology @xcite . in between the extremes , the casimir force @xcite",
    "has provided an experimentally accessible window at the mesoscopic scale through which significant information about quantum vacuum can be retrieved .",
    "the casimir force , which can be interpreted as the net effect of the radiation pressure resulting from the zero point electromagnetic fluctuations , has been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a first generation of experimental studies immediately followed this prediction , both in the parallel plane configuration originally proposed by casimir himself @xcite , and in a variant of this configuration based upon a sphere and a plane @xcite .",
    "these attempts had partial success in measuring the casimir force due to a variety of technical issues .",
    "in the last decade , a new wave of experiments have succeeded in measuring the force in the parallel plane and in the sphere - plane geometries .",
    "the accuracy obtained in the measurements ranges from 15@xmath0 in the parallel plane case @xcite to 0.1 - 5@xmath0 in the sphere - plane case @xcite .",
    "the accuracy for the former configuration is limited mainly by the stringent requirements for parallelism between the two plates while in the latter configuration the limitation is due to the small force signal available , leading to a maximum explorable distance between sphere and plane of about 1@xmath1 m @xcite . at distances smaller than 1@xmath1",
    "m the correction to the casimir force due to finite conductivity and roughness of the substrates can not be neglected , and has to be taken into account in the theoretical expression of the force .",
    "furthermore , the casimir force in the sphere - plane configuration is evaluated by using the so - called proximity force approximation @xcite , introducing an uncertainty , estimated to be in the 0.1 @xmath0 range , in the theoretical prediction .",
    "in this paper we report on theoretical and experimental studies of a geometry which interpolates between the two abovementioned configurations , namely the cylinder - plane geometry .",
    "this geometry is a compromise between the parallel plane and sphere - plane configurations , as it offers a simpler way to control the parallelism , with respect to the former geometry , while providing a sufficiently increased force signal at large distances in comparison to the sphere - plane configuration .",
    "the study of the cylinder - plane configuration also provides insights into the finite temperature contribution to the casimir force , as well as into the validity of the proximity force approximation .",
    "we show how some of these open issues in large - distance casimir physics , still to be pursued in the laboratory , are easier to deal with in this geometry with respect to those already studied .",
    "mastering the casimir force at the highest level of accuracy is mandatory to give limits to other macroscopic forces acting in the micrometer range , such as expected corrections to the newtonian gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the casimir force in the cylinder - plane geometry introducing the main sources of deviation from ideality such as finite parallelism , finite conductivity , and finite temperature .",
    "prior to this , the calculation of the electrostatic force in the same geometry is presented .",
    "this is crucial not only for the calibration of the apparatus , by applying externally controlled electric fields , but also for the discussion of the expected background noise due to unavoidable residual electrical charges present on the two surfaces .",
    "also , the validity of the proximity force approximation and some related subtleties in its definition at the next - to - leading order are discussed . in section iii , we present an apparatus developed at dartmouth to test the basic principle of the measurement and to demonstrate various techniques specific to this configuration . in section iv",
    ", we present the projected sensitivity of the apparatus .",
    "this leads to a discussion of the possible explorable physics , in particular the measurement of the thermal contribution to the casimir force and the test of the validity of the proximity force approximation .    , and in the sphere - plane case it is given by @xmath2/\\sinh(n u)$ ] , with @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a first step towards measuring the casimir force in the cylinder - plane geometry is to evaluate the force signal expected for the corresponding electrostatic force .",
    "any apparatus for measuring the casimir force has to be calibrated with a more controllable , better understood , force like the coulomb force .",
    "additionally , the electrostatic force is unavoidably present as a background due to the residual electric charges on the conducting surfaces .",

    "[ fig1 ] we compare the absolute electrostatic forces corresponding to the parallel plane , cylinder - plane and sphere - plane configurations with typical values of the relevant parameters , already achieved or achievable in practice . since , under general experimental conditions , the cylinder and the plane will not be perfectly parallel , we need to calculate the corrections to eq .",

    "from this point of view the use of resonators with a large quality factor may not seem advantageous ; in order to acquire a resonance curve with the same resolution one needs to adapt a smaller frequency binning resulting in a much longer integration time , which is more vulnerable to frequency shifts possibly induced by the finite degree of stabilization of the temperature of the apparatus .",
    "further improvements in the sensitivity are expected by implementing frequency and amplitude stabilization of the diode laser , high - performance actuators with minimal hysteresis and better displacement resolution , and a better control of the temperature setting and stabilization both for the resonator and for the fiber set - up .",
    "alternative detection schemes , like homodyne or heterodyne modulations @xcite , may be utilized to improve the precision .    as a final assessment of the experimental set - up , apart from the need for improved planarity and decreased roughness of the resonator and cylinder surfaces using optical quality surfaces , and a careful determination of the absolute distance between the cylinder and the resonator as discussed above , we need to explore the volta and patch electrostatic potentials present between the two surfaces . to quantify this source of noise",
    "it is worth introducing , in analogy to the discussion in @xcite for the parallel plane case , the equivalent voltage corresponding , at a given distance , to the casimir force . by equating eqs .",
    "( [ forceelprox ] ) and ( [ casimircyl ] ) we obtain an equivalent voltage as @xmath136 for instance , at a targeted gap of @xmath53 the casimir force corresponds to an equivalent voltage @xmath137 mv , which implies that one should control the electrostatic stray potentials within a fraction of this value in order to see the thermal contribution to the casimir force .",
    "the capability of counterbiasing the electrostatic potential difference at this level will require a dedicated study in a concrete setting once the gap distances will be reduced to few micrometers .",
    "from this point of view it is encouraging that , as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the electrostatic force in the cylinder - plane configuration can exceed at large distances the corresponding one for the parallel plane situation . this can lead to larger signals in a wider range of distances and consequently to a more precise determination of the stray voltages to be counterbiased .",
    "the apparatus could also be adapted to the study of the validity of the proximity force approximation . as we already mentioned at the end of section ii ,",
    "recent numerical results based on the wordline approach @xcite indicate that deviations from the proximity force approximation should be relevant starting from a ratio @xmath138 upward .",
    "for instance , at a distance of 5@xmath1 m they should be of the order of 1 @xmath0 for a choice of the radius of the cylinder",
    "a=100 @xmath1 m .",
    "this suggests the use of metallic wires to intentionally look for the deviation from the predictions of the proximity force approximation @xcite .",
    "we have discussed a novel geometry to study the casimir force which more adequately addresses current issues related to the large distance behavior of quantum vacuum fluctuations . in particular",
    ", this should allow for the study of the interplay of zero - point fluctuations with the thermal contribution due to the real photons present at any finite temperature .",
    "from this point of view the theoretical discussion presented here is complementary to the one presented in @xcite for the case of eccentric cylinders , the latter being promising for investigating extra - gravitational forces due to a smaller sensitivity to long - range casimir related effects .",
    "an apparatus to demonstrate some of the concepts developed in this discussion has been built and tested , showing promising features towards the observation of the thermal effect . with an upgraded version of the apparatus , including better thermal stabilization , high precision actuators , and mechanical resonators with decreased roughness , and with a careful study of the stray electrostatic potentials , we should be able to explore the casimir force in the target range centered around @xmath65 with a precision of a few percent .",
    "moreover , the possible observation of deviations from the force predicted by the proximity force approximation will be important to assess the limits to extra - dimensional forces of gravitational origin .",
