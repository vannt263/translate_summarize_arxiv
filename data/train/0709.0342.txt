    "highly charged polyelectrolytes ( pes ) are known to attract each other due to electrostatic correlations brought about by multivalent counterions ( ions of opposite charge ) @xcite .",
    "a ubiquitous phenomenon arising from these correlations is the formation of collapsed bundles of stiff pes @xcite , which is believed to play a significant role in biological processes such as cell scaffolding dynamics @xcite and motility @xcite .",
    "while our current theoretical understanding of the process of pe bundle formation predicts a macroscopic phase separation , i.e. an infinitely large bundle @xcite , experiments always find finite - sized bundles @xcite .",
    "to explain this , it has been suggested that the theoretically expected phase separation may be hindered by kinetic barriers @xcite , steric effects @xcite , or frustration of the local structure with energy penalty @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of bundle formation has also been studied using computer simulation , which indicated a tendency towards a well defined finite size @xcite .",
    "recently , an extensive study on the thermodynamic properties of a condensed bundle with multivalent counterions has been carried out , which shows that finite bundles are stable for an intermediate range of electrostatic couplings whereas at strong enough coupling the bundle could be macroscopic @xcite .",
    "multivalent counterions can also induce the structural collapse of single semiflexible polyelectrolytes @xcite and highly charged polyelectrolyte brushes @xcite .",
    "we can understand more about this phenomenon by studying the kinetics of the bundle formation .",
    "the angle dependent interaction between two rods has been recently studied @xcite and it has been shown that the preferred relative orientation of the two rods has a non - trivial connection with whether the overall interaction is attractive or repulsive . one would then like to know how this complicated angle - dependent interaction affects the fate of the filament bundle in the course of the aggregation kinetics .",
    "another question could be the dominant kinetic mode of aggregation . a brownian dynamics simulation using a model short - ranged attraction between two rods",
    "has shown that the rods are most likely to meet in a cross configuration , presumably against a barrier as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then rotate and slide to adjust into a parallel pair @xcite . another pathway with a lower barrier has been suggested in which a rod will slide parallel to an existing bundle @xcite . while these descriptions are typically in terms of pairs of rods or an effective interaction of a single filament with an already formed bundle , it is not clear _ a priori _ that they are feasible in such a highly correlated system . in particular , the orientational dependence of the many - body interaction between highly charged polymers at close proximity is highly complex and can lead to nontrivial effects , such as spontaneous formation of chiral structures @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment has been performed to probe the kinetics of bundle formation by using two different fluorescently labeled actin filaments , which suggests that actin bundles dynamically exchange filaments with the solution @xcite . in light of the new experimental insight into the system , it is important to set up a more systematic study of the kinetics of the aggregation , so that the effect of the nontrivial many - body correlations during the course of the aggregation can be better understood .     and @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 salt ions are shown by golden ( light ) spheres , @xmath2 counterions by red ( dark ) , and @xmath3 salt ions by gray spheres .",
    "it can be observed that when two filaments or two bundles meet each other the dominant crossing angle is @xmath4 degrees . in the final configuration all the pes form a single bundle . ]    here , we study the kinetics of bundle formation in the bulk solution of stiff polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent salt using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . we find that the pes undergo an aggregation process with doublets , triplets , etc forming and subsequently feeding into larger clusters .",
    "we observe that the initial stage of the kinetics leads to formation of pe bundles that have a clear size selection , up to 10 - 11 filaments for our choice of parameters .",
    "these bundles take up all the smaller clusters , and are relatively much more long - lived than the smaller ones , while larger clusters do not seem to appear even when there are a number of these long - lived filament bundles available in the solution for possible aggregation .",
    "we find that the time - dependent size distribution of the aggregates follows a smoluchowski flocculation kinetics .",
    "for the first three cluster sizes , namely single filaments , doublets , and triplets , the time evolution of the number of such clusters shows a reasonable quantitative agreement with the smoluchowski formula when the energy barrier is set to zero .",
    "this result shows that the many - body energy barrier for the formation of these clusters is relatively small , and that the time scale for the evolution is set by the diffusion of filaments in the course of the aggregation process .",
    "we also monitor the kinetics of bundle growth and find that the dominant mode is due to one end of a filament / bundle meeting another filament / bundle either in the middle mostly at right angle ( in the form of `` @xmath5 '' ) or at one end ( in the form of `` @xmath6 '' ) before rotating and sliding into a parallel packing ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : snapshot1 ] and [ fig : snapshot2 ] ) .",
    "we show that these modes can be understood from energetic considerations by calculating the angle dependence of the potential of mean force between two rods .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the main results from the simulation are presented in sec .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] closes the paper with some discussions and remarks .",
    "in our simulations of the bulk solution , which are performed with the md simulation package espresso v.1.8 @xcite , @xmath7 stiff pes are considered each composed of @xmath8 spherical charged monomers of charge @xmath9 ( electronic charge ) and diameter @xmath10 which is introduced via the lennard - jones potential ( see below ) .",
    "monomers of each pe are bonded to each other with separation between them being fixed at @xmath11 via a finite extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite and the bending rigidity of pe chains is modeled with a bond angle potential @xmath12 with @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is the angle between two successive bond vectors along the pe chain .",
    "we use @xmath15 monovalent counterions with charge @xmath16 to neutralize the pes .",
    "we also consider trivalent salt with @xmath17 positive ions with charge @xmath18 and @xmath19 negative ions with charge @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to long - ranged coulomb interaction we include short - ranged lennard - jones repulsion between particles , which introduces an energy scale @xmath20 into the system .",
    "md time step in our simulations is @xmath21 , in which @xmath22 is the md time scale and @xmath23 is the mass of the particles .     and @xmath0 .",
    "the largest bundle contains 11 pe rods ( see part f of the figure ) and two smaller bundles containing 2 and 3 pes finally join up and make a bundle of 5 rods ( final configuration is not shown in this figure ) . ]",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath24 using a langevin thermostat .",
    "we use the particle - particle particle - mesh ( pppm ) method to apply periodic boundary conditions for long - ranged coulomb interaction in the system .",
    "the strength of the electrostatic interaction energy relative to the thermal energy can be quantified using the bjerrum length @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dielectric constant of the solvent and in our simulations we have used it to fix the value for @xmath10 via @xmath27 .",

    "we then release the pes and after equilibration of the system we study the bundle formation kinetics for 8,000,000 md steps .",
    "we do simulations for different values of the number of pes @xmath32 and find that in simulations with @xmath33 and @xmath34 pe rods , in the final configuration of the system a single bundle of parallel pes forms containing all of them .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot1 ] shows snapshots of the system with @xmath35 pe rods at different times .",
    "it can be seen that pes that are going to be added to a bundle of parallel pes , first meet the bundle at right angle and then the crossing angle vanishes .",

    "[ fig : n1_n2_n3 ] as a function of @xmath54 with @xmath55 . in these plots , we have taken @xmath56 ( from ref .",

    "the results are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1_n2_n3 ] with the smoluchowski formula of eq .",
    "( [ smol - eq ] ) and an agreement in the range of the error bars can be seen .",
    "naturally , the fact that the clusters do not exceed the maximum size of 10 - 11 means that the analogy is limited to the smaller sizes .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the same value for @xmath61 gives a good agreement for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , without even a single fitting parameter being used .",
    "the fact that @xmath55 seems to provide a reasonable agreement suggests that the pe rods do not experience substantial energy barriers in their `` optimal '' kinetic paths in the course of the aggregation , although an exact knowledge of the numerical prefactor for @xmath65 in the rod geometry is required for a precise determination of the `` activation energy '' @xmath66 ( which may even turn out to be negative ) .",
    "note that the low optimal energy barrier does not mean that energetics does not play a role in the kinetics , as the dominant kinetic mode is clearly a result of strong electrostatic interactions .",
    "the problem of quantifying the kinetic barrier of the aggregation process is a complicated one , as it is not clear how one can approach it better than just looking at pair - potentials .",
    "here we propose that monitoring the time evolution of the cluster sizes could be a good alternative for capturing the many - body essence of the aggregation process .",
    "the typical time scale @xmath61 that is involved in the evolution of the cluster sizes [ see eq .",
    "( [ tp - eq ] ) ] has a diffusion - controlled component @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the initial average distance between the filaments in the solution , @xmath69 is the length of the filaments , and @xmath70 is a filament diffusion coefficient .",
    "the second component of @xmath61 comes from the many - body energetics of the system . a comparison of the simulation results for the cluster sizes with the smoluchowski formulas in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1_n2_n3 ] suggests that the diffusion part is dominant during the early stages of the aggregation until the finite - sized bundles are formed .",
    "the fact that the smoluchowski plots for zero energy barrier are close to the simulation data points , shows that the energy barriers have to be small .",
    "we chose to plot the zero energy barrier form instead of trying to fit the data to the smoluchowski formula and deduce an energy barrier , because we do not know the right prefactors for the different geometry of rods ( rather than spheres in the original smoluchowski solution ) .",
    "however , these prefactors must not differ too much from unity and therefore the argument that the barrier must be small at this stage will be justified from the agreement in fig .",

    "inset : potential of mean force between two rods which are perpendicular as a function of @xmath72 with @xmath73 . ]",
    "to understand the dominant kinetic mode of pe aggregation we study the different configurations of two rods and keep them fixed during simulation while allowing the counter - ions and salt ions to move freely . in these simulations , we calculate the average force on each monomer and obtain the total force and torque for each pe rod . by integrating the average force ( torque ) over different separations ( orientation angles ) ,",
    "we obtain the potential of mean force over a displacement ( rotation about an axis ) @xcite .",
    "let us denote the coordinates of the centers of pes 1 and 2 as @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively ( see the schematic configuration of the rods in fig . [",
    "fig : deltau_z2_y2 ] ) .",
    "we first show that in the range of salt concentration we use in our simulations , there is an attractive interaction between two pe rods which are perpendicular to each other . assume that rod 1 is fixed on the @xmath76 axis with its center at the origin , and rod 2 is parallel to the @xmath77 axis with the coordinates of its center being @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ fig : deltau_z2_y2 ] shows the potential of mean force , which is calculated as the reversible work to bring rod 2 from @xmath79 to closer separations as a function of @xmath80 , for two values of salt concentration @xmath0 and @xmath81 .",
    "it can be seen that there is an attractive interaction between two perpendicular pes .",
    "we also calculate the potential of mean force between two perpendicular rods when @xmath80 is kept fixed at @xmath82 , and @xmath72 is changed ( see the schematic configuration in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau_z2_y2 ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "we find that the potential of mean force decreases with increasing @xmath72 , which shows that when the two rods are perpendicular at close separations , the best configuration is when one end of one rod touches the other at right angle ( although the potential of mean force is only slightly lower ) .     for @xmath73 .",
    "a local minimum can be seen around @xmath83 , which is also shown as the inset of the figure .",

    "we also fix rod 1 on the @xmath76 axis with its end at the origin and fix one end of rod 2 at @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau_theta ] ) , and calculate the angular dependence of the potential of mean force by integrating the torque with respect to the rotation angle @xmath85 ( around @xmath86 axis ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau_theta ] , the orientational dependence of the potential of mean force of the two rods is shown relative to the @xmath83 configuration . in this figure , we can see that although the global minimum of the potential of mean force corresponds to parallel configuration of the rods , a local minimum exists around @xmath83 , which is shown in detail in the inset of the figure .",
    "the attractive interaction between two parallel pes in the presence of multivalent salt appears only at short separations @xcite .",
    "this means that for two rods at larger separations , it is more likely that they attract each other when they have larger relative angles , and one of the ends is meeting the other pe in the solution",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau_theta ] shows that although the local minimum is shallow compared to the parallel - configuration minimum , it covers a relatively wider range of @xmath85 , and thus crossing at `` nearly '' right angle has a considerably high probability . for obtaining each point of figs .",
    "[ fig : deltau_z2_y2 ] and [ fig : deltau_theta ] , we have used @xmath87 md steps for equilibration of the system and averaging is done over @xmath88 md steps .",
    "in a recent experiment , the kinetics of bundle formation of actin in the presence of multivalent salt has been monitored , using fluorescence microscopy , and it has been found that the initial stage of bundle growth tends to saturate when the bundles reach the size of 10 - 20 filaments @xcite .",
    "the experiment suggests that the bundles at this stage very actively exchange single filaments with the solution , and do not seem to be trapped in a non - equilibrium state that is hindered by kinetic barriers .",
    "it also shows that at later stages the bundles grow longitudinally , while still keeping the same thickness @xcite .",
    "a similar kinetic pattern is observed in our simulations , showing an initial bundle formation that appears to suddenly `` saturate '' or drastically slow down in its growth when the size of 10 - 11 is reached .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in our simulation we did not probe the equilibrium structure of the system and therefore our results do not provide conclusive information on the equilibrium distribution of the bundle sizes .",
    "we also note that we did not observe the longitudinal growth within our simulation time scale , which is consistent with the experimental observation that the time scale for the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) of the already formed bundles is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude longer than the bundle formation time scale @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that a smoluchowski type kinetics does describe even the later stages of the evolution in the experiment which involves time scale of the order of _ hours _ , but interestingly this rather long time scale is indeed mostly set by the diffusion component of the aggregation time scale @xmath61 [ eq .",
    "( [ tp - eq ] ) ] and the actual energy barrier to overcome is quite small ( of the order of @xmath89 ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests that our proposed scheme of quantifying the kinetics of the growth within the framework of a flocculation dynamics which takes into account both the availability of the constituents ( controlled by diffusion ) and the energetic barriers to overcome can help us better understand the problem of finite bundle formation . in other words , just because a part of the process is slow in absolute time scale it does not necessarily mean that a large energy barrier is involved .",
    "we would like to point out that this delicate issue has not been recognized in the previous literature of polyelectrolyte bundles .",
    "one may wonder whether the simple model used here can properly account for the physics of charged actin protein filaments in solution .",
    "in particular , the diameter of f - actin is one order of magnitude larger than the value we have used for our model stiff polyelectrolytes .",
    "looking at the spatial distribution of the charges on the large protein surface , however , one can note that they are distributed on narrow twisted strips with a helical pitch that is considerably larger than the debye length .",
    "this means that the effective portions of the charge distribution on the actin filaments that interact with each other are in fact not too different from thin short rods of the same charge density .",
    "since the debye screening length is much smaller than the pitch , one expects that the twist structure does not matter that much at this stage .",
    "another important point is that finite - sized bundle formation has been observed in a variety of bio - polyelectrolytes such as actin , microtubule etc .",
    ", each of which having very different detailed structures @xcite .",
    "the generality of the observed phenomenon suggests that the details of the individual systems are probably not the key determining factor in the formation of finite bundles .",
    "since all of the bio - polymers that make finite bundles are highly charged , one is naturally led to the important question of whether electrostatics alone can cause this effect .",
    "this is why observation of a tendency to form finite bundles in simple model polyelectrolytes like ours could provide the key to understanding the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon .",
    "finally , we would like to remark on a similar work that has been recently performed by sayar and holm , in which the thermodynamic properties of condensed bundles with multivalent counterions is studied @xcite .",
    "they use a hybrid mc - md technique , and are primarily concerned with finding the ultimate equilibrium properties of the system , rather than the kinetic pathways of going towards that equilibrium which we probe . in this sense , the two works are complementary as they approach a similar problem from different perspectives and with different tools .",
    "the main finding of ref .",
    "@xcite is that depending on the parameters the equilibrium state of such stiff polyelectrolytes could be both finite bundles and macroscopic condensation .",
    "their results on potential of mean force can be used to deduce energy barriers , which are in agreement with our kinetic estimates .",
    "there are also slight differences in the two systems which might cause differences in their behaviors .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite there are no added salt ions and the system just has enough counterions to neutralize .",
    "this means that entropic considerations might hamper full neutralization of the system and thus create additional barriers ( for unneutralized bundles ) . in our case",
    "because we have both salt and counterions , the monovalent ions can partake the entropy and therefore the multivalent counterions can happily reside in the bundle areas , which is perhaps a more faithful modeling of the actual environment of such systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the kinetics of the bundle formation for stiff polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solutions .",
    "the distribution of cluster sizes was found to follow a smoluchowski dynamics , with no appreciable energy barrier in the optimal kinetic paths , in contrast to previous suggestions @xcite .",
    "we also found that the dominant kinetic mode of aggregation comes from configurations with one end of a rod meeting the other rods at nearly right angle , and not parallel as proposed in ref .",
    "these results could hopefully shed some light on the controversial issue of the finite size of actin bundles .        c. holm , p. kekicheff , and r. podgornik , _ electrostatic effects in soft matter and biophysics _ ( kluwer , dordrecht , 2001 ) ; y. levin , rep .",
