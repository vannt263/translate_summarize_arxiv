    "the approach based on the extremality condition in relies on an easy - to - state assumption , and typically provides a more precise estimate .",

    "this leads to the poisson dirichlet distribution of weights discussed above . finally , the entropy per variable @xmath181 is non - analytic at @xmath105 .",
    "let us conclude by stressing two points .",
    "first , we avoided the @xmath182-sat and @xmath182-coloring cases .",
    "these cases ( as well as the @xmath182-coloring on erds - rnyi graphs @xcite ) are particular in that the dynamic transition point @xmath110 is determined by a local instability ( a kesten - stigum @xcite condition , see also @xcite ) , yielding @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( the case @xmath185 , @xmath186 being marginal ) .",
    "related to this is the fact that @xmath187 : throughout the clustered phase , the measure is dominated by a few large clusters ( technically , @xmath188 for all @xmath189 ) .",
    "second , we did not check the ` local stability ' of the 1rsb calculation . by analogy with @xcite",
    ", we expect that an instability can modify the curve @xmath131 but not the values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "two message passing algorithms were studied extensively on random @xmath2-sat : belief propagation ( bp ) and survey propagation ( sp ) ( mixed strategies were also considered in @xcite ) .",
    "a bp message @xmath190 between nodes @xmath191 and @xmath192 on the factor graph is usually interpreted as the marginal distribution of @xmath193 ( or @xmath194 ) in a modified graphical model .",
    "an sp message is instead a distribution over such marginals @xmath195 .",
    "the empirical superiority of sp is usually attributed to the existence of clusters @xcite : the distribution @xmath195 is a ` survey ' of the marginal distribution of @xmath193 over the clusters . as a consequence , according to the standard wisdom , sp should outperform bp for @xmath196 .",
    "this picture has however several problems .",
    "let us list two of them .",
    "first , it seems that essentially local algorithms ( such as message passing ones ) should be sensitive only to correlations among finite subsets of the variables , and these remain bounded up to the condensation transition .",
    "recall in fact that the extremality condition in involves a number of variables unbounded in @xmath5 , while the weaker in is satisfied up to @xmath105 .",
    "secondly , it would be meaningful to weight uniformly the solutions when computing the surveys @xmath195 . in the cavity method jargon",
    ", this corresponds to using a 1rsb parisi parameter @xmath197 instead of @xmath198 as is done in @xcite .",
    "it is a simple algebraic fact of the cavity formalism that for @xmath197 the means of the sp surveys satisfy the bp equations . since the means are the most important statistics used by sp to find a solution , bp should perform roughly as sp .",
    "both arguments suggest that bp should perform well up to the condensation point @xmath105 .",
    "we tested this conclusion on @xmath156-sat at @xmath199 , through the following numerical experiment , cf .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] .",
    "@xmath35 run bp for @xmath200 iterations .",
    "@xmath37 compute the bp estimates @xmath201 for the single bit marginals and choose the one with largest bias . @xmath202",
    "fix @xmath203 or @xmath104 with probabilities @xmath204 , @xmath205 .",
    "@xmath206 reduce the formula accordingly ( i.e.  eliminate the constraints satisfied by the assignment of @xmath31 and reduce the ones violated ) .",
    "this cycle is repeated until a solution is found or a contradiction is encountered .",
    "if the marginals @xmath207 were correct , this procedure would provide a satisfying assignment sampled uniformly from @xmath55 .",
    "in fact we found a solution with finite probability ( roughly @xmath208 ) , despite the fact that @xmath209 .",
    "the experiment was repeated at @xmath210 with a similar fraction of successes ( more data on the success probability will be reported in @xcite ) .    above the condensation transition ,",
    "correlations become too strong and the bp fixed point no longer describes the measure @xmath69 . indeed",
    "the same algorithm proved unsuccessful at @xmath211 .",
    "as mentioned above , sp can be regarded as an inference algorithm in a modified graphical model that weights preferentially small clusters .",
    "more precisely , it selects clusters of size @xmath212 with @xmath213 maximizing the complexity @xmath131 . with respect to the new measure",
    ", the weak correlation condition in still holds and allows to perform inference by message passing .    within the cavity formalism",
    ", the optimal choice would be to take @xmath214 .",
    "any parameter corresponding to a non - negative complexity @xmath215 $ ] should however give good results .",
    "sp corresponds to the choice @xmath198 that has some definite computational advantages , since messages have a compact representation in this case ( they are real numbers ) .",
    "this section provides some technical elements of our computation .",

    "a detailed account shall be given in @xcite .",
    "on a tree factor graph , the marginals of @xmath55 , eq .   can be computed recursively .",
    "the edge of the factor graph from variable node @xmath29 to constraint node @xmath14 ( respectively from @xmath14 to @xmath29 ) carries `` message '' @xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) , a probability measure on @xmath8 defined as the marginal of @xmath31 in the modified graphical model obtained by deleting constraint node @xmath14 ( _ resp_. all constraint nodes around @xmath29 apart from @xmath14 ) .",

    "@xmath228 is a function of the messages @xmath217 from neighboring function nodes .",

    "this expression coincides with the bethe free - energy @xcite as expressed in terms of messages .    in order to move from trees to loopy graphs ,",
    "we first consider an intermediate step in which the factor graph is still a tree but a subset of the variables , @xmath234 is fixed .",
    "we are therefore replacing the measure @xmath55 , cf .",

    "<S> this representation allows to define naturally a distance @xmath30 between variable nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> ensembles of random csp s ( rcsp ) were introduced ( see e.g.  @xcite ) with the hope of discovering generic mathematical phenomena that could be exploited in the design of efficient algorithms . indeed several search heuristics , such as walk - sat @xcite and ` myopic ' algorithms @xcite have been successfully analyzed and optimized over rcsp ensembles . the most spectacular advance in this direction has probably been the introduction of a new and powerful message passing algorithm ( ` survey propagation ' , sp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the original justification for sp was based on the ( non - rigorous ) cavity method from spin glass theory . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent work proved that standard message passing algorithms ( such as belief propagation , bp ) can indeed be useful for some csp s @xcite . nevertheless , the fundamental reason for the ( empirical ) superiority of sp in this context remains to be understood and a major open problem in the field . </S>",
    "<S> building on a refined picture of the solution set of rcsp , this paper provides a possible ( and testable ) explanation .     between variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( filled squares are constraints and empty circles variables ) . here , for instance , @xmath33 and @xmath34.[fig : factor ] ]    we consider two ensembles that have attracted the majority of work in the field : @xmath35 random @xmath2-sat : each @xmath2-sat instance with @xmath5 variables and @xmath36 clauses </S>",

    "<S> it is well known that rcsp s may undergo phase transitions as the number of constraints per variable @xmath40 is varied - regular graphs , we can use @xmath41 as a parameter . </S>",
    "<S> when considering a phase transition defined through some property @xmath42 increasing in @xmath38 , we adopt the convention of denoting its location through the smallest integer such that @xmath43 holds . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the best known of such phase transitions is the sat - unsat one : as @xmath40 crosses a critical value @xmath44 ( that can , in principle , depend on @xmath5 ) , the instances pass from being satisfiable to unsatisfiable with high probability . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for @xmath2-sat </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that @xmath45 . a conjecture based on the cavity method </S>",
    "<S> was put forward in @xcite for all @xmath15 that implied in particular the values presented in table  [ table : crit ] and @xmath46 for large @xmath2 @xcite . subsequently it was proved that @xmath47 confirming this asymptotic behavior @xcite . an analogous conjecture for @xmath3-coloring was proposed in @xcite yielding , for regular random graphs @xcite , the values reported in table  [ table : crit ] and @xmath48 for large @xmath3 ( according to our convention , random graphs are whp uncolorable if @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was proved in @xcite that @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> even more interesting and challenging are phase transitions in the structure of the set @xmath51 of solutions of rcsp s ( ` structural ' phase transitions ) . assuming the existence of solutions , a convenient way of describing @xmath0 is to introduce the uniform measure over solutions @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that , since @xmath0 depends on the rcsp instance , @xmath55 is itself random .    </S>",
    "<S> .critical connectivities for the dynamical , condensation and satisfiability transitions in k - sat and q - col[table : crit ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we shall now introduce a few possible ` global ' characterizations of the measure @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> each one of these properties has its counterpart in the theory of gibbs measures and we shall partially adopt that terminology here @xcite .    in order to define the first of such characterizations , we let @xmath56 $ ] be a uniformly random variable index , denote as @xmath57 the vector of variables whose distance from @xmath29 is at least @xmath58 , and by @xmath59 the marginal distribution of @xmath31 given @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> then we say that the measure satisfies the uniqueness condition if , for any given @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath60 as @xmath61 ( here and below the limit @xmath62 is understood to be taken before @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this expresses a ` worst case ' correlation decay condition . roughly speaking : </S>",
    "<S> the variable @xmath31 is ( almost ) independent of the far apart variables @xmath57 _ irrespective _ is the instance realization and the variables distribution outside the horizon of radius @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold for uniqueness ( above which uniqueness ceases to hold ) was estimated in @xcite for random @xmath2-sat , yielding @xmath64 $ ] ( which is asymptotically close to the threshold for the pure literal heuristics ) and in @xcite for coloring implying @xmath65 for @xmath3 large enough ( a ` numerical ' proof of the same statement exists for small @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> below such thresholds bp can be proved to return good estimates of the local marginals of the distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that the uniqueness threshold is far below the sat - unsat threshold . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , several empirical studies @xcite pointed out that bp ( as well as many other heuristics @xcite ) is effective up to much larger values of the clause density . in a remarkable series of papers @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , statistical physicists argued that a second structural phase transition is more relevant than the uniqueness one . </S>",
    "<S> following this literature , we shall refer to this as the ` dynamic phase transition ' ( dpt ) and denote the corresponding threshold as @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) . in order to precise this notion , </S>",
    "<S> we provide here two alternative formulations corresponding to two distinct intuitions . according to the first one , above @xmath66 the variables @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> become globally correlated under @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion in is replaced by one in which far apart variables @xmath57 are themselves sampled from @xmath69 ( ` extremality ' condition ) : @xmath70 as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the infimum value of @xmath40 ( respectively @xmath38 ) such that this condition is no longer fulfilled is the threshold @xmath66 ( @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course this criterion is weaker than the uniqueness one ( hence @xmath72 ) .    according to the second intuition , above @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> , the measure decomposes into a large number of disconnected ` clusters ' . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there exists a partition @xmath73 of @xmath1 ( depending on the instance ) such that : @xmath35 one can not find @xmath4 such that @xmath74 ; @xmath37 denoting by @xmath75 the set of configurations @xmath76 whose hamming distance from @xmath77 is at most @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 exponentially fast in @xmath5 for all @xmath4 and @xmath80 small enough . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the measure @xmath69 can be decomposed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall always refer to @xmath84 as the ` finer ' partition with these properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the above ideas are obviously related to the performance of algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the correlation decay condition in is likely to be sufficient for approximate correctness of bp on random formulae . also , the existence of partitions as above implies exponential slowing down in a large class of mcmc sampling algorithms instead of @xmath85 whenever the @xmath14-th constraint is violated . </S>",
    "<S> glauber dynamics can then be used to sample from the relaxed measure @xmath86 . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , some important rigorous results were obtained supporting this picture  @xcite . however , even at the heuristic level , several crucial questions remain open . </S>",
    "<S> the most important concern the distribution of the weights @xmath87 : are they tightly concentrated ( on an appropriate scale ) or not ? </S>",
    "<S> a ( somewhat surprisingly ) related question is : can the absence of decorrelation above @xmath66 be detected by probing a subset of variables bounded in @xmath5 ?    </S>",
    "<S> sp @xcite can be thought as an inference algorithm for a modified graphical model that gives unit weight to each cluster @xcite , thus tilting the original measure towards small clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting performances will strongly depend on the distribution of the cluster sizes @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> further , under the tilted measure , @xmath66 is underestimated because small clusters have a larger impact . </S>",
    "<S> the correct value was never determined ( but see @xcite for coloring ) . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite undertook the technically challenging task of determining the cluster size distribution , without however clarifying several of its properties .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we address these issues , and unveil at least two unexpected phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> our results are described in the next section with a summary just below . </S>",
    "<S> finally we will discuss the connection with the performances of sp . </S>",
    "<S> some technical details of the calculation are collected in the last section . </S>"
