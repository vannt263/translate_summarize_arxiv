    "we discuss a new mechanism of generation of high energy photons by means of a planar channeling of ultra - relativistic positrons through a periodically bent crystal .",
    "the _ feasibility _ of this scheme was explicitly demonstrated in @xcite . in these papers as well as in our subsequent publications @xcite-@xcite the idea of this new type of radiation , all essential conditions and limitations which must be fulfilled to make possible",
    "the observation of the effect and a crystalline undulator operation were formulated in a complete and adequate form for the first time .",
    "a number of corresponding novel numerical results were presented to illustrate the developed theory , including , in particular , the calculation of the spectral and angular characteristics of the new type of radiation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review the results obtained so far in this newly arisen field as well as to carry out a historical survey of the development of all principal ideas and related phenomena .",
    "the necessity of this is motivated by the fact that the importance of the ideas suggested and discussed in @xcite-@xcite has been also realized by other authors resulting in a significant increase of the number of publications in the field within the last 3 - 5 years @xcite-@xcite but , unfortunately , often without proper citation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we review all publications known to us which are relevant to the subject of our research .",
    "the main phenomenon to be discussed in this review is the radiation formed in a crystalline undulator .",
    "the term crystalline undulator ( introduced but not at all elaborated clearly in @xcite ) stands for a system which consists of two essential parts : ( a ) a crystal whose crystallographic planes are bent periodically , and ( b ) a bunch of ultra - relativistic positively charged particles undergoing planar channeling in the crystal . in such a system there appears , in addition to a well - known channeling radiation , the radiation of an undulator type which is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes .",
    "the intensity and the characteristic frequencies of this undulator radiation can be easily varied by changing the energy of beam particles and the parameters of crystal bending .",
    "the mechanism of the photon emission by means of a crystalline undulator is illustrated by figure [ figure1_jpg ] .",
    "short comments presented below aim to focus on the principal features of the scheme relevant to the subject of the review . at the moment we do not elaborate all the important details but do this in section [ feasibility ] .    the @xmath0-plane in the figure is a cross section of an initially linear crystal , and the @xmath1-axis represents the cross section of a midplane of two neighbouring non - deformed crystallographic planes ( not drawn in the figure ) spaced by the interplanar distance @xmath2",
    ". two sets of black circles denote the nuclei which belong to the periodically bent neighbouring planes which form a periodically bent channel .",
    "the amplitude of the bending , @xmath3 , is defined as a maximum displacement of the deformed midplane ( thick solid line ) from the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 stands for a spatial period of the bending . in principle , it is possible to consider various shapes , @xmath5 , of the periodically bent midplane . in this review",
    "we will mainly discuss the harmonic form of this function , @xmath6 .",
    "for further referencing let us stress here that we will mainly consider the case when the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy strong double inequality : @xmath7 .",
    "typically @xmath8 cm , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "open circles in figure [ figure1_jpg ] denote the channeled ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "provided certain conditions are met , the particles , injected into the crystal , will undergo channeling in the periodically bent channel .",
    "thus , the trajectory of a particle ( represented schematically by the dashed line ) contains two elements .",
    "firstly , there are oscillations inside the channel due to the action of the interplanar potential ,  -  the channeling oscillations .",
    "this mode is characterized by a frequency @xmath11 dependent on the projectile type , energy , and the parameters of the interplanar potential . secondly , there are oscillations because of the periodicity of the distorted midplane , - the undulator oscillations , whose frequency is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the velocity of light which approximately is the velocity of an ultra - relativistic particle ) .    spontaneous emission of photons which appears in this system is associated with both of these oscillations",
    ". typical frequency of the emission due to the channeling oscillations is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relativistic lorenz factor @xmath16 .",
    "the undulator oscillations give rise to the photons with frequency @xmath17 where the quantity @xmath18 , a so - called undulator parameter , is related to the amplitude and the period of bending , @xmath19 .    if strong inequality @xmath20 is met than the frequencies of the channeling radiation and the undulator radiation are also well separated , @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the characteristics of the undulator radiation ( the intensity and spectral - angular distribution ) are practically independent on the channeling oscillations but depend on the shape of the periodically bent midplane .    for @xmath22",
    "the scheme presented in figure [ figure1_jpg ] leads to the possibility of generating a stimulated undulator emission .",
    "this is due to the fact , that photons emitted at the points of the maximum curvature of the midplane travel almost parallel to the beam and thus , stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima and minima . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that it is feasible to consider emission stimulation within the range of photon energies @xmath23 kev ( a gamma - laser ) .",
    "these energies correspond to the range @xmath24 @xmath25 of the emission wavelength , which is far below than the operating wavelengths in conventional free - electron lasers ( both existing and proposed ) based on the action of a magnetic field on a projectile @xcite .    however , there are essential features which distinguish a seemingly simple scheme presented in figure [ figure1_jpg ] from a conventional undulator . in the latter",
    "the beam of particles and the photon flux move in vacuum whereas in the proposed scheme they propagate through a crystalline media .",
    "the interaction of both beams with the crystal constituents makes the problem much more complicated from theoretical , experimental and technical viewpoints . taking into consideration a number of side effects which accompany the beams dynamics ,",
    "it is not at all evident _ a priori _ that the effect will not be smeared out . therefore , to prove that the crystalline undulator as well as the radiation formed in it both are feasible it is necessary to analyze the influence , in most cases destructive , of various related phenomena . only on the basis of such an analysis one can formulate the conditions which must be met and define the ranges of parameters ( which include the bunch energy , the types of projectiles , the amplitude and the period of bendings , the crystal length , the photon energy ) within which all the criteria are fulfilled . in full this accurate analysis was carried out very recently and the feasibility of the crystalline undulator and the gamma - laser based on it were demonstrated in an adequate form for the first time in @xcite and in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "> from the viewpoint of this compulsory programme which had to be done in order to draw a conclusion that the scheme in figure [ figure1_jpg ] can be transformed from the stage of a purely academic idea up to an observable effect and an operating device we review critically some of the recent publications as well as the much earlier ones @xcite .",
    "this is done in section [ feasibility ] .    prior to start with the discussion of various aspects of the electromagnetic radiation from a beam of charged particles channeling in a periodically bent crystal let us briefly mention the phenomena closely related to our main problem .",
    "these are : channeling in straight and in bent crystals , channeling radiation and undulator radiation .",
    "we do not pretend to cover the whole range of problems concerning the channeling effect , the channeling radiation and the radiation formed in the undulators .",
    "this section is devoted solely for a brief description of the effects closely related to the main subject of this review .",
    "the basic effect of the _ channeling process in a straight crystal _ is that a charged particle can penetrate at an anomalously large distance when traveling nearly parallel to a crystallographic plane ( the planar channeling ) or an axis ( the axial channeling ) and experiencing the collective action of the electrostatic field of the lattice ions .",
    "the latter is repulsive at small distances for positively charged particles and , therefore , they are steered into the interatomic region , while negatively charged projectiles move in the close vicinity of ion strings or planes .",
    "channeling was discovered in the early 1960s by computer simulations of ion motion in crystals of various structure @xcite .",
    "large penetration lengths were obtained for low - energy ( up to 10 kev ) ions incident along crystallographic directions of low indexes . these calculations allowed to explain the results of earlier experiments .",
    "later , a comprehensive theoretical study @xcite introduced the important model of continuum potential for the interaction energetic charged projectiles and lattice atoms arranged in strings and planes . using this approach the criterion for a stable channeling",
    "was formulated .",
    "according to it the beam of particles becomes trapped by the interplanar or axial potential if the incident angle of the beam with respect to the crystal plane or the axis is smaller than the so - called critical lindhard angle @xmath26 .",
    "these concepts were subsequently widely used to interprete channeling experiments for low energy projectiles ( @xmath27 gev ) , see , e.g. , @xcite , and for high energies of the particles ( @xmath28 gev ) @xcite . in recent years channeling of charged particles in straight nano - tubes , usually carbon nano - tubes , has been intensively investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we mention these papers for the sake of completeness but do not pretend to review them , since this field is not related directly to the main subject of our research .",
    "lindhard @xcite was also the first who theoretically described the _ dechanneling process _ , - the phenomenon of a gradual increase of the transverse energy of a channeled particle due to inelastic collisions with nuclei and electrons of the crystal . as a consequence , initially channeled particle during its passage through the crystal gains the transverse energy higher than the continuum potential barrier . at this point",
    "the particle leaves the channel and is , basically , lost for the channeling process .",
    "the scale which defines the ( average ) interval for a particle to penetrate into a crystal until its dechannels is called a dechanneling length , @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity depends on the parameters of a crystal ( these include the charge of nuclei , the interatomic spacing , the mean atomic radius , the amplitude of thermal vibrations ) and the parameters of a channeled particle , - the energy and the charge .",
    "it is important to note that for negative and for positive projectiles the dechanneling occurs in different regimes . as mentioned above , the interplanar ( or axial ) potential is repulsive at small distances for positively charged particles and is attractive for negatively ones .",
    "therefore , negatively charged particles tend to channel in the regions around the nuclei whereas positive particles are pushed away .",
    "consequently , the number of collisions with the crystal constituents is much larger for negatively charge particles and they dechannel faster .",
    "typically , the dechanneling lengths of positive charges exceed those for negative ones ( of the same energy and charge modulus ) by the order of magnitude or more @xcite .",
    "this statement is valid , both for axial and planar channeling , and for various pairs of positive / negative particles of the same charge modulus : for @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 @xcite , and @xmath32 @xcite .      channeling of charged particles in crystals is accompanied by the _ channeling radiation _",
    "this specific type of electromagnetic radiation arises due to the transverse motion of the particle inside the channel under the action of the interplanar field ( the channeling oscillations , see figure [ figure1_jpg ] ) .",
    "the phenomena of channeling radiation of a charged projectile in a linear crystal , see e.g. @xcite , as well as in a simple ( i.e. non - periodic , one - arc ) bent channel @xcite , are known , although in the latter case the theoretical and experimental data are scarce , at least up to now .    for the purpose of this review",
    "it is important to mention several well - established features of the channeling radiation .",
    "firstly , as well as in any other radiative process of a charge moving in an external potential ( e.g. bremsstrahlung @xcite ) , the intensity of the channeling radiation is inversely proportional to the squared mass of the projectile .",
    "consequently , a channeled electron / positron emits @xmath33 times more intensively than a proton with the same value of relativistic factor @xmath15 .",
    "for both electrons and positrons the intensity of radiation in the channeling mode greatly exceeds ( by more than an order of magnitude ) that by the same projectile in an amorphous medium @xcite .",
    "finally , the radiative energy loss is of a channeled electron is noticeably higher than that of a positron of the same energy .",
    "this is valid for all energy ranges ( from several mev up to hundreds of gev ) of the projectile @xcite .",
    "physical reason for this is that electrons channel in vicinity of the crystal nuclei , therefore they are accelerated stronger and radiated more energetic photons than positrons which channel in the region of a weaker field .",
    "the study of the channeling radiation initially proposed for particles moving in crystals was later extended to the case of nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the channeling process in a bent crystal takes place @xcite if the maximal centrifugal force , acting on the projectile because of the channel bending , is less than the force due to the interplanar field @xcite : @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass and velocity of the projectile , @xmath15 is its relativistic factor and @xmath37 is a curvature radius of the bent channel , @xmath38 is the charge of the projectile and the quantity @xmath39 stands for the maximum gradient of the interplanar field .",
    "provided this condition is fulfilled , the beam of positively charged channeling particles at each instant moves inside the channel , especially parallel to the bent crystal midplane as it does in the case of the channeling in a straight crystal .",
    "since it first theoretical prediction @xcite and experimental support @xcite the idea to deflect high - energy beams of charged particles by means of a planar channeling in bent crystals had attracted a lot of attention worldwide and still is of a great interest .",
    "indeed , the beams ( in particular , those of ultra - relativistic protons and heavy ions ) can be steered by crystals much more efficiently than by means of external macroscopic electric or magnetic fields . in recent experiments with 450",
    "gev protons @xcite the efficiency of the particle beam deflection was reported on the level of 60% @xcite and of 85% for the 70-gev protons beam @xcite .",
    "the progress in deflecting of heavy - ions beams was reported recently as well @xcite .",
    "we refer to the reviews papers which cover state - of - the - art in this field , and describe in detail all the stages of the development of the idea as well as a number of phenomena which are of current interest @xcite .",
    "deflection of the beams of negatively charged particles by planar channeling is strongly suppressed because of the increased role of the dechanneling @xcite .",
    "the deflection of beams of particles , both positive and negative , during axial channeling was simulated numerically @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of this effect has demonstrated small efficiency of extracting the beam particles @xcite .",
    "another possible application of bent crystal concerns its possible use to focus beams of ultra - relativistic heavy - ions @xcite or protons @xcite . to this end",
    "a crystal is needed in which the crystal axes are no longer parallel , but are slanted more and more the farther away they are from the axis of the beam .",
    "then the bending angle of the particles far away from the beam axis would be largest and a general focusing effect will result .",
    "such a crystal can in principle be produced by varying the nickel to copper ( or sb to bi ) ratio in a mixed crystal @xcite .",
    "similar idea was suggested also for producing periodically bent crystals , see section [ feasibility ] for more detail .",
    "recently , it was suggested to use bent nanotubes to steer beams of charged particle @xcite .      the theory and also various practical implementations of the undulator radiation , i.e. the radiation emitted by a charge moving in spatially periodic static magnetic fields ( a magnetic undulator ) , or in a static macroscopic electric field ( electrostatic undulator ) , or in a laser field ( a laser - based undulator ) , etc .",
    "have long history @xcite and are well elaborated @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the undulator radiation , which clearly distinguishes it from other types of electromagnetic radiation formed by a charge moving in external fields , is in a peculiar form of the spectral - angular distribution .",
    "namely , for each value of the emission angle @xmath40 ( measured with respect to the undulator axis ) the spectral distribution consists of a set of narrow , powerful and equally spaced peaks ( harmonics ) .",
    "the peak intensity is proportional to the square of total number of the undulator periods , @xmath41 .",
    "this factor reflects the constructive interference of radiation emitted from each of the undulator periods and is typical for any system which contains @xmath42 coherent emitters ( e.g. @xcite ) . in an ideal undulator ,",
    "i.e. the one in which a particle follows either a sinusoidal periodic trajectory ( a planar undulator ) or a helical one ( a helical undulator ) under the action of a non - dissipative external force , and for a fixed @xmath40 the widths of all peaks are the same and proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "the coherence is lost if one integrates the spectral - angular distribution over the emission angle .",
    "indeed , although the spectral distribution as a function of photon frequency @xmath44 contains maxima ( which are noticeably widened as compared to those in spectral - angular distribution ) the intensity in which is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "these two features of the undulator radiation , the high intensity in the peaks of spectral - angular distribution and the narrow widths , are important for a successful operation of free - electron lasers ( fel ) , the devices which transform the spontaneous undulator radiation into the stimulated one . since the first discovery of the fel operational principle @xcite both the theory and practical implementation of fels have been well elaborated ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in ideal conditions a bunch of particle undergoing channeling in a linear crystal",
    "can be considered as an undulator ( a natural undulator ) .",
    "indeed , due to the periodicity of the trajectory the characteristics of the channeling radiation are close to those of the undulator radiation @xcite .",
    "however , the characteristics of the radiation emitted in natural undulator are masked in experiment ( e.g. @xcite ) because of the distribution of the beam particles in the transverse energy , and in the incident angle .",
    "additionally , in the natural undulator the emission peaks become noticeably wider due to a deviation of an interplanar potential from a harmonic one .",
    "this leads to the dependence of the undulator period on the amplitude of the channeling oscillations which , in turn , defines the frequency of the emitted radiation .",
    "in this section we describe , more thoroughly , the crystalline undulator , formulate the conditions , which must be fulfilled for its operation , and present the detailed literature survey covering the development of all essential aspects of this important idea . also we review theoretical methods to be used for an adequate description of this phenomenon .",
    "the idea of a gamma - laser based on the crystalline undulator is discussed in section [ stimulatedemission ] .      as it was noted in section [ introduction ] in a crystalline undulator",
    "the beam of channeled particles and the emitted photons propagate in a media .",
    "therefore , prior to drawing a conclusion that the scheme illustrated by figure [ figure1_jpg ] is not of academic interest but can be made realistic and to represent a new type of an undulator , one has to understand to what extent general characteristics of the undulator radiation ( high intensity , high degree of monochromaticity of the spectral - angular distribution ) are influenced by the presence of a crystalline media .    to fulfill this programme and to establish the ranges of various parameters",
    "within which the operation of the crystalline undulator is feasible we had analyzed the following basic problems :    * planar or axial channeling ? positive or negative particles ? @xcite",
    "* condition for the stable channeling in a periodically bent crystal @xcite .",
    "* crystalline undulator preparation : static and dynamic bending @xcite . *",
    "large and small amplitude regimes @xcite .",
    "* dechanneling and photon attenuation and the length of a crystalline undulator @xcite . * energy losses and the shape of a crystalline undulator @xcite .      keeping in mind that negatively charged particles are steered along crystallographic axes and planes much less efficiently than positively charged ones and that the effect of axial channeling in bent crystals has not been observed so far , we focus our discussion on the planar channeling of positively charged particles and , in particular , on the channeling of light projectiles , positrons , in periodically bent crystals .",
    "this system is the most appropriate for the creation of the crystalline undulator operating in the high energy photon regime .",
    "note , that from theoretical viewpoint the generalization of the treatment of the undulator radiation in crystalline undulators to the case of axial channeling is straightforward .",
    "however , small values of the dechanneling lengths of projectiles in this case make such a discussion purely academic and bring it far beyond any realistic experimental opportunities .",
    "the principal difference in the behaviour of positively and negatively charged particles in a crystalline undulator was realized for the first time in @xcite .",
    "this fact has determined , to a great extent , the main focuses of our subsequent publications @xcite-@xcite . in some of the earlier publications on the subject @xcite , the authors did not distinguish clearly the cases of electron and positron channeling in a crystalline undulator and often discussed channeling of electrons rather than positrons .",
    "they did not analyze the strong condition , limiting the operation of a crystalline undulator , which originates from the dechanneling of particles during their passage through periodically bent crystals .",
    "below we consider this important condition in more detail when discussing the dechanneling process .",
    "following our conclusions made in @xcite , the authors of @xcite in their later publications @xcite also began to focus on the channeling of positively charged particles in crystalline undulators .",
    "this remark concerns not only this particular issue , but rather most of the physics of the processes taking place in crystalline undulators , which was analyzed and clarified in @xcite and our subsequent publications .",
    "for example , all physical conditions for the operation of a crystalline undulator outlined on page 113 in @xcite are taken from our earlier work @xcite but without any reference .",
    "the condition for channeling in a periodically bent crystal is subject to the general criterion ( [ 1 ] ) for the channeling process in a bent crystal @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and can be fulfilled by a proper choice of the projectile energy and the maximal curvature of the channel .",
    "for the first time the limiting role of the channeling criterion on the parameters of the crystalline undulator was elucidated in @xcite . in the earlier publications on the subject",
    "this analysis was not carried out .",
    "similar to the case of an one - arc bent crystal , a stable channeling of an ultra - relativistic positively charged particle in a periodically bent crystal occurs if the maximum centrifugal force , @xmath45 , is less than the maximal force due to the interplanar field , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "more specifically @xcite , the ratio @xmath47 is better to keep smaller than 0.1 . if otherwise the phase volume of the trajectories , corresponding to the channeling mode , becomes significantly reduced .",
    "the inequality @xmath48 relates the energy of an ultra - relativistic particle , @xmath49 , the parameters of the bending ( these define the quantity @xmath50 ) , and the characteristics of the planar potential .    choosing a harmonic shape @xmath51 for the periodically bent channel ( see figure [ figure1_jpg ] ) ,",
    "one derives @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the decrease in @xmath53 and , consequently , the increase in the maximum centrifugal acceleration of the particle in the channel is achieved by decreasing @xmath4 and increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the criterion for a stable channeling implies the following relationship between the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56    for the first time , the limiting role of the channeling criterion ( [ condition.1 ] ) on the parameters of the crystalline undulator was elucidated in @xcite .    provided ( [ condition.1 ] )",
    "is fulfilled , the projectile , incident at the angle smaller than the lindhard angle @xmath26 with respect to the mid - plane , is trapped in the channel , see figure [ figure1_jpg ] .",
    "the passage of an ultra - relativistic particle gives rise to the emission of photons due to the curvature of the trajectory , which becomes periodic reflecting the periodicity of the channel midplane .",
    "this radiation is enhanced because of the coherent emission from similar parts of the trajectory , and , as a result , it may dominate over the channeling radiation @xcite .",
    "there are two essentially different regimes of the radiation formation in a periodically bent crystals .",
    "these regimes are defined by the magnitude of the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the undulator radiation and the channeling radiation are well separated provided the condition @xmath58 is fulfilled , see figure [ figure1_jpg ] .",
    "typically , spacing between the planes , which are characterized by the low values of the miller indices such as the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) planes , lies within the range @xmath59    ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the condition is fulfilled for the bending amplitudes @xmath60  .",
    "a similar separation of the two radiative mechanisms takes place in non - periodically bent crystals , where the curvature of the channel leads to an additional synchrotron - type radiation by a channeling particle @xcite .",
    "this component of the emission transforms into the undulator radiation in the periodically bent channel .    in the limit @xmath58 , which we call a large - amplitude regime ,",
    "the separation of the two radiative mechanisms occurs because the frequency of the channeling oscillations , @xmath61 , is much higher than the frequency , @xmath62 , of the transverse oscillations caused by the periodicity of the channel @xmath63 .",
    "consequently , the characteristic frequencies of the channeling and the undulator radiation can be estimated as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath66 can be written in the following form @xmath67 this relation shows that if both conditions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are fulfilled , then the characteristic frequencies are well separated .",
    "moreover , if one is only interested in the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation , one may disregard the channeling oscillations and assume that the projectile moves along the centerline of the bent channel @xcite .",
    "additionally , as it will be demonstrated below in the paper , in the high - amplitude regime the intensity of the undulator radiation is higher than that of the channeling radiation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may state that the limit @xmath58 is essential to call the undulator - type radiation due to the periodic structure of the crystal bending as a new phenomenon and to consider it as a new source of the emission within the @xmath70- and @xmath15-range .    for @xmath71 and for @xmath72 equation ( [ cond4 ] ) yields @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the two spectra are well separated and the crystalline undulator radiation , both spontaneous and stimulated , can be treated independently from the ordinary channeling radiation .    the importance of the large - amplitude regime was noted in @xcite and independently in @xcite . in the papers @xcite the detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of this condition was carried out , and the calculation of realistic spectral and angular distribution of the undulator radiation were performed for the first time .",
    "the first calculation of the total radiative spectra ( i.e. the spectra in which both ordinary channeling radiation and the crystalline undulator radiation are taken into account ) for the @xmath74 mev positrons channeling in the silicon along the ( 110 ) crystallographic planes for different @xmath57 ratios has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "these calculations have supported the qualitative arguments , formulated above , on the possibility to separate radiations emitted via two different mechanisms .",
    "calculations , performed in @xcite , have also demonstrated that the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation can be made much larger than that of the channeling radiation .",
    "we consider this example in more detail in section [ crystundrad ] .    in the large - amplitude regime , in addition to the condition ( [ condition.1 ] ) , it is very important to consider other conditions under which the periodically bent crystal may serve as a crystalline undulator .",
    "these other conditions appear when one takes into account the destructive role of the dechanneling effect and the photon attenuation .",
    "the restrictive influence of these phenomena on the parameters of the crystalline undulator is discussed in detail in section [ dechannnelingattenuation ] . here",
    "we want to note that a comprehensive quantitative analysis of all the conditions , which must be met , was performed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast such a full and important discussion was omitted in the papers @xcite .",
    "our analysis , carried out in @xcite , has shown , in particular , that the optimal range of the amplitude values , where all the necessary conditions can be fulfilled , is @xmath75 .",
    "we want to point out that exactly this range of @xmath3 was discussed in later publications @xcite without proper citation of our results .",
    "the values of @xmath3 mentioned above are much lower than the interval @xmath76 considered in @xcite . in section [ allconditions ]",
    "we demonstrate that the parameters , used in @xcite to characterize the crystal bending , do not lead to the emission of undulator - type radiation .    in the papers @xcite we demonstrated that in the low - amplitude regime , when @xmath77 , the intensity of the undulator radiation is smaller than that of the channeling radiation .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath78 the undulator radiation becomes less intensive than the background bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "hence , it is highly questionable whether the crystalline undulator radiation can be considered as a new phenomenon in the limit of low @xmath3 .",
    "however , the low - amplitude regime allows to consider a a resonant coupling of two mechanisms of the photon emission , the channeling radiation and the undulator radiation .",
    "indeed , for @xmath78 and by a proper choice of the parameter @xmath79 ( see ( [ condition.1 ] ) ) it is possible to make the frequency of the undulator radiation @xmath80 comparable or equal to that of the channeling radiation @xmath81 . if @xmath82 , then the intensity of the _ channeling _ radiation can be resonantly enhanced even in the case when the undulator radiation is much less intensive .",
    "this very interesting phenomenon was considered in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the first two from this list discussed the modification of the channeling radiation spectrum in the case of an electron and/or a positron channeling in a superlattice . in the papers",
    "@xcite the parametric resonant enhancement of the channeling radiation emitted by positrons in the presence of either transverse or longitudinal supersonic field was considered .",
    "the authors of the cited papers investigated neither the crystalline undulator nor the undulator radiation formed in it .",
    "therfore , we are not going to discuss further the results obtained in these papers , because the subject of their research is absolutely different from the topic of this review .",
    "the term undulator implies that the number of periodic elements ( i.e. the number of undulator periods , @xmath42 ) is large . only in this limit the radiation formed during the passage of a bunch of relativistic particles through a periodic system bears the features of an undulator radiation ( narrow , well - separated peaks in spectral - angular distribution ) rather than those of a synchrotron radiation .",
    "hence , the following strong inequality , which entangles the period @xmath4 and the length of a crystal @xmath83 must be met in the crystalline undulator @xcite : @xmath84    the parameter @xmath4 , together with the amplitude @xmath3 and the energy of the particle , define other quantities , which are called the undulator frequency @xmath62 and parameter @xmath18 , and which are commonly used when characterizing an undulator : @xmath85 let us note the proportionality of the parameter @xmath18 to the relativistic factor @xmath15 .",
    "this dependence is typical for a crystalline undulator , but is absent for the undulators ( both helical and planar ) based on the action of magnetic field . in the latter case",
    "the undulator parameter is equal to @xmath86 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath87 is the amplitude value of the magnetic induction and @xmath88 is the period of the magnetic field .    in turn , the quantities @xmath89 , @xmath18 and @xmath42 define the parameters of the spontaneous undulator radiation , which are the characteristic frequencies @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( harmonics ) and the natural width , @xmath92 , of the peaks . in a perfect planar undulator , where the trajectory of the particle has a harmonic form @xmath51 , the frequency @xmath93 of the fundamental harmonic and the width",
    "are given by ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the emission angle measured with respect to the @xmath1-direction ( see figure [ figure1_jpg ] ) .",
    "note that the relative width , @xmath96 , is inversely proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "> from the general theory of a planar undulator ( see , e.g. @xcite ) it is known , that the magnitude of the undulator parameter , @xmath18 , defines the number of the harmonics in which the radiation is effectively emitted . in the case @xmath97 the radiation is mainly emitted into the first harmonic . in the limit @xmath98 the number of harmonics increases proportionally to @xmath99 , and , the spectrum of emission acquires the form of a synchrotron radiation rather than an undulator radiation . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that in a crystalline undulator both possibilities can be realized .",
    "however , to stay away from the synchrotron limit , @xmath100 , it is desirable to consider moderate values of the undulator parameters @xmath101 .",
    "this condition , accompanied with the inequality ( [ condition.2 ] ) ensures that the spectrum of radiation formed in the undulator will be presented by several powerful , narrow and well - separated peaks .",
    "taking into account that the undulator parameter is proportional to the relativistic factor , which in ultra - relativistic case is much larger than one ( typically , @xmath102 in crystalline undulators ) , the condition @xmath101 results in a strong inequality @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "combined with the large - amplitude regime , which is explained in section [ largeandsmallampl ] , we found that three quantities , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which characterize the crystalline undulator must satisfy the following strong double inequality : @xmath104 this condition , clearly stated in @xcite and used by us in further publications , together with the conditions ( [ condition.1 ] ) and ( [ condition.2 ] ) , are essential for the effective operation of the crystalline undulator .",
    "let us note , that the last inequality in ( [ condition.3 ] ) ensures , also , the deformation of a crystal is the elastic one and does not destroy the crystalline structure .",
    "the periodic bending of the crystal can be achieved either dynamically or statically . in @xcite-@xcite",
    "the main focus of our studies was made on the dynamic bending by means of a high - amplitude ( @xmath58 ) transverse acoustic wave ( aw ) , although the possibility of the static bending was pointed out as well .",
    "the general formalism , developed in these papers for the description of the crystalline undulator and the radiation formed in it , does not depend on the method of the crystal bending .",
    "the analysis , which was performed in the cited papers , allowed us to establish the ranges of the aw amplitude and frequency within which the conditions ( [ condition.1 ] ) , ( [ condition.2 ] ) and ( [ condition.3 ] ) as well as other very important conditions ( which are described below in this section ) are fulfilled .",
    "this was done for different types of projectiles , wide ranges of their energies and for a variety of crystals .",
    "thus , we proved theoretically the feasibility of the construction of a micro - undulator by means of a periodically bent crystal and the possibility of generation of spontaneous and stimulated photon emission in such a system .    the monochromatic transverse aw ( either standing or running ) of the large amplitude , transmitted along a crystallographic plane , allows to achieve a harmonic shape @xmath51 for the midplane .",
    "one of the possibilities which can be used to do this is to place a piezo sample atop the crystal and to generate the radio frequency aw to excite the oscillations .",
    "the important feature of the dynamic scheme of the crystal bending is that the time period of the aw must exceed greatly the time of flight @xmath105 of a bunch of particles through the crystal .",
    "then , on the time scale of @xmath106 , the shape of the crystal bending does nt change , so that all particles of the bunch channel inside the same undulator .",
    "thus , for the aw frequencies @xmath107 mhz , one gets @xmath108 cm , which is more than well - fulfilled for any realistic @xmath83-value ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea to create an undulator by transmitting a high - amplitude transverse aw through a crystalline structure was mentioned for the first time in @xcite ( see , also , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we state that in these papers neither the feasibility of the crystalline undulator nor its theory were developed in a complete and adequate form , because not all essential regimes , conditions and limitations were understood and elucidated . as a result , few statements and estimates , made in @xcite , turn out to be not quite correct , as it is shown in sections [ dechannnelingattenuation ] and [ allconditions ] .",
    "this is the reason why the idea of the crystalline undulator based on the action of aw has not been attracting attention during the period from 1980 till late 90 s , when our first publications @xcite appeared .",
    "there were other papers @xcite , published prior to our first works @xcite , devoted to the problem of radiation by ultra - relativistic particles ( electrons and positrons ) channeled in the crystal in the presence of ultrasonic wave .",
    "however , in all these publications the low - amplitude regime @xmath77 ( and , in some cases , the limit @xmath78 ) was discussed .",
    "therefore , the main focus of these studies was made on various aspects of the influence of the additional undulator - type oscillations of the particles on the spectrum of the channeling radiation rather than on the properties of the crystalline undulator .",
    "the important feature of a dynamically bent crystal by means of an aw is that it allows to consider an undulator with the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath18 varying over a wide range , which is determined not only by the projectile s energy but also by the aw frequency and amplitude .",
    "the latter two quantities can easily be tuned resulting in the possibility of varying significantly the intensity and shape of the angular distribution of the radiation ( for a detailed discussion and an number of concrete examples see @xcite ) .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the parameters of the crystalline undulator based on the aw are inaccessible in conventional undulators , where the periodicity of the motion of charged particles in achieved by applying periodic magnetic fields or the laser field @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the static channel is that its parameters are fixed and thus , the projectile moves along the fixed trajectory as well . to calculate the characteristics of the emitted radiation one needs to know only the number of the periods and the local curvature radius .",
    "the disadvantage is that when fixing the number of periods the parameters of the system can be varied only by changing the energy of the particle .",
    "this makes the photon generation less tuneable .    for the first time",
    "the idea of a static crystalline undulator was proposed in @xcite and implied the use of a superlattice made of two constituents , which have different , but close , lattice spacings .",
    "however , these papers were devoted only to the study of the low - amplitude regime @xmath77 . as mentioned above",
    ", in this limit the intensive undulator radiation does not appear .",
    "it is feasible , by means of modern technology ( like molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition , see the references in @xcite ) , to grow the crystal with its channels been statically bent according to a particular pattern .",
    "the usage of static methods to produce periodically bent crystals with @xmath58 was initially suggested in @xcite and later was discussed in @xcite , where the idea to construct a crystalline undulator based on graded composition strained layers was proposed .",
    "earlier , the same idea was exploited in @xcite , where the possibility to create a crystalline lens for the focusing of a beam of charged particles through a bent crystal was discussed .",
    "experimentally , the possibility of a 3 mev proton beam bending by the si@xmath109ge@xmath110 graded composition strained layers was demonstrated in @xcite .    in our papers",
    "@xcite we developed further the ideas of @xcite and demonstrated , for the first time , that it is possible to obtain periodically bent channels with _",
    "arbitrary _ shapes @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , it was described in detail , that to obtain a pure sine form of the channel profile , one starts with a pure silicon substrate and adds @xmath111 layers with continuously increasing ge content .",
    "this results in bending of the ( 110 ) channels in the direction of the ( 100 ) channels .",
    "the periodicity of the shape requires the change of the direction of the bending toward the ( 010 ) channels .",
    "this , in turn , can be achieved by reducing @xmath112 until it reaches 0 .",
    "the last ( within the first period ) crystal layer consists of pure silicon , so that the second period can be built up on top of the first in the same manner . to be captured by the bent channel , the positron beam should be directed towards the ( 110 ) channel of the substrate .",
    "the crystal strain is strongest after half a period , when the germanium content reaches its maximum .",
    "the thickness of the layers corresponding to half a period must be smaller than the critical thickness @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we developed the formalism and carried out the corresponding calculations which demonstrated , how one can built up a crystal , the channels of which are bent periodically with arbitrary shapes @xmath5 .    in the papers by avakian @xcite , published within the same time interval as our papers @xcite , somewhat different approach , based on the use of graded composition strained superlattices @xmath111 , for constructing the sine profile of crystal channels was described . in the more recent publication @xcite of this group",
    "the authors proceeded further with the study of the possibility to construct crystalline undulators by means of gradient crystals .",
    "we want to point out that in this paper , which appeared after @xcite , the authors completely omitted the citation of our papers .",
    "indeed , the publication @xcite was ignored at all , whereas the citation of @xcite ( labeled as ref . [ 7 ] in @xcite ) was done in an extremely negligent and misleading way which excludes any possibility for a reader to find our paper . moreover , in the introductory part of their paper ( p. 496 ) the authors of @xcite , when reviewing `  a few proposals [ 2 - 5 ] for constructing micro - crystalline undulators  ' , found it possible to include @xcite and their own publications @xcite in the citation list but to ignore our papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this very selective and misleading style of citation one finds in all publications of this group , see refs .",
    "we find this style as totally unacceptable , especially in the field which has become studied intensively _",
    "after _ our first papers @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the only example of a selective citation .",
    "it refers also to the papers by bellucci @xcite and to a very recent paper @xcite , where the authors claimed that ` the theory of radiation in micro - undulators is developed ' ( see the abstract ) .",
    "the periodic bending of crystallographic planes can also be achieved by making regular defects either in the crystal volume or on its surface @xcite .",
    "then , the crystalline planes in the vicinity of the defects become periodically bent . the practical realization of this idea",
    "was achieved in @xcite by giving periodic micro - scratches to one face of a silicon crystal by means of a diamond blade . paying tribute to the fact that this was the first attempt of the actual construction of the micro - undulator ,",
    "we , nevertheless , want to point out that the introductory part of the paper @xcite significantly misinterprets the history of the crystalline undulator idea .",
    "moreover , at the stage of preparation of the subsequent paper @xcite one of the authors of @xcite was aware of our work in this field , but found it possible to himself not to include our papers in the citation list .      as was pointed out in @xcite , two physical phenomena , the dechanneling effect and the photon attenuation , lead to severe limitation of the allowed values of the crystalline undulator .",
    "if the dechanneling effect is neglected , one may unrestrictedly increase the intensity of the undulator radiation by considering larger @xmath42-values .",
    "in reality , random scattering of the channeling particle by the electrons and nuclei of the crystal leads to a gradual increase of the particle energy associated with the transverse oscillations in the channel . as a result , the transverse energy at some distance from the entrance point exceeds the depth of the interplanar potential well , and the particle leaves the channel .",
    "consequently , the volume density @xmath114 of the channeled particles decreases with the penetration distance , @xmath1 , and , roughly , satisfies the exponential decay law @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the volume density at the entrance .",
    "the dechanneling length @xmath117 , which is dependent on the parameter @xmath79 ( see ( [ condition.1 ] ) ) , depends also on the particle energy , mass and charge , on the parameters of the channel ( its width and the distribution of electron charge in the channel ) , and on the charge of the crystal nuclei .",
    "the dechanneling phenomenon introduces a natural upper limit on the length of a crystalline undulator : @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , one can consider the limit @xmath119 .",
    "however , as it was demonstrated in @xcite , the intensity of the undulator radiation in this case is not defined by the expected number of the undulator periods @xmath120 but rather is formed in the undulator of the effective length @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out realistic estimates of the quantity @xmath117 in order to understand what are the limitations on the parameters of the undulator imposed by dechanneling .    in a model approach , presented in @xcite , we used the following expression for the dechanneling length in a periodically bent crystal : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the dechanneling length in a straight crystal . for a positively charged projectile a good estimate for @xmath122 is @xcite : @xmath123 where @xmath124 cm is the electron classical radius , @xmath125 , @xmath126",
    "are the charge and the mass of a projectile measured in units of elementary charge and electron mass , @xmath127 is the thomas - fermi atomic radius .",
    "the quantity @xmath128 stands for a coulomb logarithm which characterizes the ionization losses of an ultra - relativistic particle in amorphous media ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath129 with @xmath130 being the mean ionization potential of an atom in the crystal .    in channeling theory",
    "it is more common @xcite to relate @xmath122 to the parameter @xmath131 ( @xmath18 is the momentum of a projectile , and in the ultra - relativistic case @xmath132 ) rather than to express it via the relativistic factor @xmath15 as in ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4 ] ) .",
    "however , explicit dependence of the dechanneling length on @xmath15 is more convenient when discussing the parameters of the crystalline undulator and its radiation @xcite .",
    "the dependences @xmath122 on @xmath15 for a positron and a proton are illustrated by figure [ figure2_jpg ] .",
    "it is seen that in the case of a positron ( the solid curves ) the quantity @xmath122 varies within @xmath133 cm for @xmath15 within @xmath134 .",
    "the dechanneling length of a positron with energy within the gev range ( @xmath135 ) does not exceed several millimeters . for a proton ( the dashed curves ) of the same @xmath15 the magnitude of @xmath122 is enhanced by the factor @xmath136 .",
    "this is largely due to the factor @xmath137 ( see ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4 ] ) ) .",
    "some additional correction originates from the difference of the coulomb logarithms , equation ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.5 ] ) . to obtain the values of @xmath122 for a heavy ion one can multiply the dashed curves by the factor @xmath138 .    using the results presented in figure [ figure2_jpg ] one can write the following estimate of the dechanneling length for various projectiles @xcite : @xmath139 for heavy projectiles formulae ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4])-([dechannnelingattenuation.5 ] ) are in good agreement with measured values of @xmath122 in a wide range of @xmath15 @xcite . in the case of a positron channeling in @xcite we tested equations ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.3 ] ) and ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4 ] ) against more rigorous calculation of the dechanneling lengths based on the simulation procedure of the positron channeling in straight and periodically bent crystals .",
    "the approach developed and described in detail in @xcite is based on the simulation of the trajectories and the dechanneling process of an ultra - relativistic positron .",
    "this was done by solving the three - dimensional equations of motion which account for : ( i ) the interplanar potential ; ( ii ) the centrifugal potential due to the crystal bending ; ( iii ) the radiative damping force ; ( iv ) the stochastic force due to the random scattering of projectile by lattice electrons and nuclei .",
    "note that the radiation damping force becomes very significant at sufficiently large energies of positrons ( see section [ radiativeloss ] for more details ) . simultaneously with simulating the trajectories of the channeled particles , we calculated the total spectrum of the radiation , including its undulator and channeling parts .",
    "this was done for all trajectories , including those which corresponded to the over - barrier particles .",
    "such a study was carried out for the first time in @xcite .",
    "we point out that the referencing to these papers of ours was not made in the later publications by bellucci @xcite , where the development of a simular approach was mentioned .",

    "this is absolutely incorrect . indeed , as it is seen from figures [ figure2_jpg]-[figure5_jpg ] and table [ table1 ] , the dechanneling lengths for a positron are , at least , an order of magnitude less , not mentioning the electron case , when the values of @xmath29 are even more lower . as a result , the estimated values of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath44 , which were suggested in @xcite , for a crystalline undulator based on a @xmath157 gev positron channeling in si , lay far away from the regions allowed for feasible crystalline undulators . in section [ allconditions ] below we discuss in more detail the parameters suggested in @xcite .",
    "the propagation of photons emitted in a crystalline undulator is strongly influenced by a variety of processes occuring in a crystal .",

    "we consider the set of analytical and numerical results obtained by us in the cited papers as a proof of the statement that the scheme illustrated in figure [ figure1_jpg ] can be transformed from the stage of a purely academic idea up to an observable effect and an operating device .    for a positron channeling",
    ", in particular , we found the the optimal regime in which the spontaneous undulator radiation is most stable and intensive , and demonstrated that this regime is realistic .",
    "this regime is characterized by the following ranges of the parameters : @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , which are common for all the crystals which we have investigated .",
    "these ranges ensure that the energy of the first harmonic @xmath93 ( see ( [ harmonics.1 ] ) ) lies within the interval @xmath186 kev and the length of the undulator can be taken equal to the dechanneling length because of the inequality @xmath187 .    the importance of exactly this regime of operation of the crystalline undulator was later realized by other authors . in particular , in recent publications by bellucci @xcite , where the first practical realization of the crystalline undulator was reported ,",
    "the parameters chosen for a si crystal were as follows : @xmath188 gev for a positron ( i.e. @xmath189 ) , @xmath190 (i.e .",
    "@xmath191 ) , @xmath192 .",
    "these are exactly the values for which we predicted the strong undulator effect . however , in these papers , where the authors mention all the conditions ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) and stress their importance , there is no proper reference to our works . instead , our paper @xcite , labeled as ref .",
    "[ 10 ] in @xcite , was cited as follows : ` with a strong world - wide attention to novel sources of radiation , there has been broad theoretical interest [ 4 - 12 ] in compact crystalline undulators  ' ( page 034801 - 1 in the cited paper ) .",
    "this was the only referencing to the paper @xcite , in which we clearly formulated , for the first time , the conditions ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) and carried out a detailed analysis aimed to prove why this regime is most realistic .",
    "none of it was done in the papers @xcite ( labeled in @xcite as refs .",
    "[ 4],[6],[7],[8 ] and [ 9 ] , correspondingly ) .",
    "moreover , we state that one will fail to construct a crystalline undulator basing on the estimates presented in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we carry out critical analysis of the statements and the estimates made in the cited papers .    historically , the paper by kaplin @xcite was the first one , where the idea of a crystalline undulator based on the action of the transverse acoustic wave was presented",
    ". however , a number of ambiguous or erroneous statements makes it impossible to accept the thesis that the concept of a crystalline undulator was correctly described in this two - page paper . to be precise in our critics , below we use the exact citations taken from the english edition of @xcite . in the citations",
    "the italicizing is made by us .",
    "our first remark concerns the type of a projectile which the authors propose to use in the undulator .",
    "the first paragraph of the paper contains :    ` radiation by relativistic _ electrons and positrons _ , which occurs during channeling in single crystals , has been observed experimentally and is being extensively studied at the present time@xmath193 . '    this is the _ only _ place in the text where the term positron is used . in the rest of the paper the projectile is called either a particle , or a relativistic electron as in one before the last paragraph of the paper ( page 651 ) .",
    "thus , it is absolutely unclear to the reader , which particle is to be used . for a positron it is possible to construct an undulator ,",
    "however if an electron is considered , then the rest of the paper does not make any sense .",
    "the concept of a periodically bent crystal and its parameters is formulated as follows ( page 650 , right column ) :    ` still higher intensity can be achieved by using instead of a uniformly curved crystal one deformed in such a way that the radiation from different portions of the particle trajectory adds coherently .",
    "this can be accomplished by giving a crystalline plate a wavelike shape in such a way that the sagitta @xmath194 satisfies the relation @xmath195 in relation to the quarter period @xmath196 of the bending .",
    "_ for large values of the dechanneling depth @xmath197 this will provide a high radiated power from the crystalline undulator ( wiggler)_. for rather thin crystalline plates with a simple bend one can produce @xmath198 mm  _ we recall that the channeling depth in centimeters is approximately @xmath199 ( gev ) _ , as follows from experiments . '",
    "note , that no citation is made when referring to the experiments which result in ` @xmath197 ( cm ) = @xmath200 ( gev ) ' . for a positron ( see section [ dechannnelingattenuation ] ) this relation overestimates the dechanneling length by more than an order of magnitude , for an electron it is even farther from the reality .",
    "therefore , the idea to construct an undulator for a positron with the period @xmath201 cm is absolutely unrealistic .",
    "the parameters of the undulator based on the action of the acoustic wave are presented in the left column on page 651 :    ` to obtain radiation in the optical region in a transparent crystal or to generate very hard @xmath15 rays , it has been proposed to use ultrasonic vibrations to deform the crystal lattice  for example , one can obtain @xmath15 rays with the energy up to @xmath202 mev for @xmath203 gev and @xmath204 @xmath147 m . '    note , that none of the following characteristics , - the type of the projectile , the crystal , the acoustic wave amplitude ( in our notations sagitta a is called amplitude @xmath3 ) , are specified .",
    "_ assuming _ that the positron channeling is implied , let us analyze the above mentioned values from the viewpoint of the condition for a stable channeling , equation ( [ condition.1 ] ) ( see also ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath79 can be written in the form : @xmath205 with @xmath4 in @xmath147 m , @xmath54 in gev , @xmath2 in  , and @xmath206 in gev / cm .",
    "let us estimate the ratio @xmath57 for the range @xmath207 @xmath147 m and for ( 110 ) planes in si and w , for which @xmath208  , @xmath209  , @xmath210 gev / cm , @xmath211 gev / cm @xcite . for @xmath203 gev and",
    "the lowest @xmath4-value one gets @xmath212 , which means that , for both crystals , to satisfy the condition @xmath68 it is necessary to consider @xmath78 .",
    "thus , this is a low - amplitude regime , for which the intensity of the undulator radiation is negligibly small .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath4 is more realistic to ensure the condition @xmath68 for the amplitudes @xmath69 .",
    "however , this analysis is not performed by the authors .",
    "our final remark concerns the statement ( the last paragraph in the left column on page 651 ) :    ` a lattice can be deformed elastically up to @xmath213   '",
    "this is true , but when referring to the crystalline undulator with the amplitude @xmath214 cm one has to supply the reader ( and a potential experimentalist ) with the estimates of the corresponding values of @xmath4 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us carry out these estimates ( note , this was _ not _ done in the paper ) .",
    "the channeling condition ( [ condition.1 ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the absolute minimum of @xmath4 ( for given @xmath3 , @xmath54 and a crystal ) which corresponds to @xmath217 ( i.e. to the case when the dechanneling length @xmath117 effectively equals to zero , see ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.3 ] ) ) .",
    "it is equal to @xmath218 for a 1 gev positron channeling in si and w crystals along the ( 110 ) plane , which is plane bent periodically with @xmath214 cm , the values of @xmath216 are : @xmath219 cm for si and @xmath220 cm for w. these values already exceed the upper limit of @xmath221 @xmath147 m mentioned by kaplin . choosing the length of the crystal to be equal to the dechanneling length and using equation ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.3 ] ) to estimate @xmath117 one estimates the number of undulator periods @xmath222 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath42 is achieved when @xmath223 , giving @xmath224 .",
    "hence , @xmath225 . using formulae ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4 ] ) and ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.5 ] )",
    "one calculates the dechanneling lengths in straight crystals : @xmath226 cm @xmath227 cm for w. finally , one derives that the ` undulator ' suggested in the cited paper contains @xmath228 periods in the case of si , and @xmath229 for a tungsten crystal .",
    "thus , because of the inconsistent and ambiguous character of the paper @xcite we can not agree with the statement , the feasibility of a crystalline undulator was demonstrated in this paper in a manner , sufficient to stimulate the experimental study of the phenomenon .",
    "none of the essential conditions , summarized in ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) , were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "for the first time such an analysis was carried out in @xcite and developed further in our subsequent publications . in this connection",
    "we express disagreement with utterly negligent and unbalanced style of citation adopted by avakian in @xcite and other publications @xcite by this group , and by bellucci @xcite .",
    "much of our critics expressed above in connection with @xcite refers also to the paper by baryshevsky @xcite .",
    "the main point of ours is : the concept of the crystalline undulator based on the action of an acoustic wave was not convincely presented .",
    "> from the text of the paper it is not at all clear what channeling regime , axial or planar , should be used .",
    "the only reference to the regime is made in last part of the paper , on page 63 , which is devoted to the quantum description of the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation .",
    "this part starts with the sentence : let us consider , for example , planar channeling. the question on whether the axial channeling is also suitable for a crystalline undulator is left unanswered by the authors .",
    "neither is it clearly stated what type of a projectile is considered . indeed , in all parts of the paper , where the formalism is presented , the projectile is called as a particle. the reference to a positron is made in the introductory paragraph , where the effect of channeling radiation is mentioned , and on page 62 , where the numerical estimates of the intensity of the undulator radiation are presented . the limitations due to the dechanneling effect are not discussed .",
    "as a consequence , the regime , for which the estimates are made , hardly can be called the undulator one .",
    "indeed , on page 62 the ratio of the undulator to the channeling radiation intensities is estimated for a 1 gev positron channeled in si ( _ presumably _ , the planar channeling is implied ) .",
    "the amplitude of the acoustic wave ( labeled as @xmath230 ) is chosen to be equal to @xmath231 cm .",
    "the period @xmath4 is not explicitely written by the authors .",
    "however , they indicate the frequency of the acoustic wave , @xmath232 s@xmath233 . hence , the reader can deduce that @xmath234 cm , if taking the value @xmath235 cm / s for the sound velocity in si @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath54 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , together with the maximal gradient of the interplanar field @xmath210 gev / cm @xcite , allows one to calculate @xmath236 ( see ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) ) , and , consequently , to estimate the dechanneling length @xmath237 cm . as a result , we find that the number of the undulator periods in the suggested system is @xmath238 , which is not at all @xmath239 as it is implied by the authors ( this is explicitly accented by them in the remark in the line just below their equation ( 2 ) on page 62 ) .",
    "another point of critics is that the classical formalism , used to derive the equation ( 2 ) , is applicable only for the dipole case , i.e. when the undulator parameter is small , @xmath240 .",
    "however , the estimates which are made refer to a strongly non - dipolar regime : @xmath241 . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimate of the energy of the largest emitted harmonic , carried out by the authors on page 62 , is totally wrong .",
    "exactly in their regime the harmonics with low number will never emerge from the crystal due to the photon attenuation .",
    "papers @xcite .",
    "considered _ only _ the case of small amplitudes , @xmath78 , when discussing the channeling phenomenon in periodically bent crystalline structures . as a result , in @xcite",
    "the attention was paid not to the undulator radiation ( the intensity of which is negligibly small in the low - amplitude regime , see section [ crystundrad ] ) , but to the influence of the periodicity of the channel bending on the spectrum of the channeling radiation .",
    "similar studies were carried out in @xcite .",
    "these effects are irrelevant from the viewpoint of the crystalline undulator problem discussed here .",
    "another issue , which we want to point out , is that the authors of @xcite did not distinguish between the cases of an electron and a positron channeling .",
    "the limitations due to the dechanneling effect were not discussed . in @xcite the idea of using a superlattice ( or a crystal bent by means of a low - amplitude acoustic wave ) as an undulator for a free electron laser was explored .",
    "the main focus was made on the regime when the undulator radiation is strongly coupled with the ordinary channeling radiation .",
    "this regime is different from the subject of the present discussion .",
    "the essential role of the large - amplitude regime of the crystalline undulator was not demonstrated in these papers .",
    "the important issue of the study of the radiation formed in a crystalline undulator concerns the choice of the formalism used to describe the phenomenon .",
    "this point could have been regarded as merely a technical one but it is not so .",
    "contrary to the case of conventional undulators , based on the action of magnetic fields , the physics of crystalline undulators is , basically , a newly arisen field of research .",
    "therefore , any theoretical study of the effect , which pretends to go a bit farther than purely academic considerations , must contain a great part of numerical analysis and numerical data on the basis of which real experimental investigations can be envisaged . in turn , to obtain the reliable data it is necessary to choose a theoretical tool which allows , on the one hand , to treat adequately all principal physical phenomena involved into the problem , and , on the other hand , to carry out numerical analysis of the obtained analytical expressions . in the crystalline undulator problem",
    "there are three basic phenomena which must be accurately described .",
    "these are : ( i ) the motion of an ultra - relativistic particle in an external ( strong ) field , ( ii ) the process of photon emission by the particle , ( iii ) the problem of the radiative recoil , which results in the radiative losses of the projectile .",
    "the most rigorous approach to tackle ( theoretically ) these problems is the one based on quantum electrodynamics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , where the amplitude of the process is described in terms of a single free - free matrix element of the photon emission taken between the initial and final states of an ultra - relativistic particle in the interplanar field .",
    "the main ( technical ) limitation of this approach appear due to the fact that in the ultra - relativistic limit , when @xmath242 the number of the energy levels related to the transverse motion in the effective potential increases significantly .",
    "consequently , an accurate description , i.e. numerical calculations , of the particle dynamics becomes a formidable task .",
    "it is exactly this sort of difficulties which resulted in the absence of _ any _ numerical analysis and data for the emission spectra in the papers @xcite , where the radiation formed in the crystalline undulator was treated in terms of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "another option is to study the problem within the framework of classical electrodynamics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this method was used in the early works @xcite , and was later applied in @xcite . in connection to the crystalline undulator problem",
    "the purely classical description is valid if ( i ) the characteristic energy of the projectile in an external field , @xmath243 , is much less than its total energy , @xmath244 , and , ( ii ) the radiative recoil , i.e. the change of the projectile energy due to the photon emission , is neglected .",
    "the first condition is well fulfilled in the case of the ultra - relativistic particle channeling in a crystal .",
    "indeed , typical values of @xmath243 are equal , in the order of magnitude , to the depth of the interplanar potential well .",
    "the latter varies from several ev , for the crystals of made of light elements ( e.q .",
    "lih crystal , see @xcite ) , up to @xmath245 ev for heavy crystals like w ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath246 .",
    "the role of the radiative recoil is described by the ratio @xmath247 .",
    "purely classical description implies that @xmath248 .",
    "although practical implementation of the classical treatment is comparatively simple , in application to the crystalline undulator it is fully approved in the so - called dipole - limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) , when the undulator parameter is small , @xmath97 , and all the undulator emission occurs in the fundamental harmonic .",
    "such an assumption leads to a considerable narrowing of the parameters of the crystalline radiation and , also , disregards the possibility to generate the emission in higher harmonics .",
    "another disadvantage of the approach based on classical mechanics and electrodynamics is that it fails when the energy of the projectile becomes sufficiently large . for a positron",
    "this means @xmath249 gev . for this energies",
    "the probability of the emission of the gamma - quanta of energy @xmath250 via the mechanism of the channeling radiation can not be neglected .",
    "the third approach , which can be used in studying of the radiative processes occuring in external fields in ultra - relativistic domain , was developed by baier and katkov in the late 1960s @xcite , and was called by the authors ` the operator quasi - classical method ' .",
    "the details of this formalism can be found also in @xcite .",
    "> from the practical viewpoint , the advantage of the quasi - classical method is that it justifies the classical description of the motion of an ultra - relativistic particle in an external field ( i.e. , the use of the trajectories rather than the wavefunctions ) , and , simultaneously , takes into account the effect of the radiative recoil .",
    "thus , the quasi - classical approach neglects the the terms @xmath251 , but it explicitly takes into account the quantum corrections due to the radiative recoil in the whole range of the emitted photon energies , except for the extreme high energy tail of the spectrum . using this method the spectra of photons and electron - positron pairs in linear crystals were successfully described @xcite . it was also applied to the problem of a synchrotron - type radiation emitted by an ultra - relativistic projectile channeling in a non - periodically bent crystal @xcite .    in @xcite-@xcite",
    "this general formalism of baier and katkov was used for theoretical and numerical description of the spectral and angular distribution of the crystalline undulator radiation , total photon emission spectra and the radiative energy losses of positrons channeling through the periodically bent crystal .",
    "to illustrate the crystalline undulator radiation phenomenon , let us consider the spectra of spontaneous radiation emitted during the passage of positrons through periodically bent crystals .",
    "the results presented below clearly demonstrate the validity of the statements made in @xcite and summarized in section [ allconditions ] above , that the properties of the undulator radiation can be investigated separately from the ordinary channeling radiation .",
    "the calculated spectra of the radiation emitted in the forward direction ( with respect to the @xmath1-axis , see figure [ figure1_jpg ] ) in the case of @xmath151 gev planar channeling in si along ( 110 ) crystallographic planes and for the photon energies from 45 kev to 1.5 mev are presented in figures [ figure8_jpg ] @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 was varied within the interval @xmath252 ( the interplanar spacing is 1.92  ) .",
    "the case @xmath253 corresponds to the straight channel .",
    "the period @xmath4 used for these calculations equals to @xmath254 cm .",
    "the number of undulator periods and crystal length were fixed at @xmath255 and @xmath256 cm .",
    "these data are in accordance with the values allowed by ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) ( see also figure [ figure5_jpg ] ) .    the spectra correspond to the total radiation , which accounts for the two mechanisms , the undulator and the channeling .",
    "they were calculated using the quasi - classical method @xcite .",
    "briefly , to evaluate the spectral distribution the following procedure was adopted ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "first , for each @xmath57 value the spectrum was calculated for individual trajectories of the particles .",
    "these were obtained by solving the relativistic equations of motion with both the interplanar and the centrifugal potentials taken into account .",
    "we considered two frequently used @xcite analytic forms for the continuum interplanar potential , the harmonic and the molire potentials calculated at the temperature @xmath257 k to account for the thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms .",
    "the resulting radiation spectra were obtained by averaging over all trajectories .",
    "figures [ figure8_jpg ] correspond to the spectra obtained by using the molire approximation for interplanar potential .",
    "the first graph in figure [ figure8_jpg ] corresponds to the case of zero amplitude of the bending ( the ratio @xmath253 ) and , hence , presents the spectral dependence of the ordinary channeling radiation only .",
    "the asymmetric shape of the calculated channeling radiation peak , which is due to the strong anharmonic character of the molire potential , bears close resemblance with the experimentally measured spectra @xcite .",
    "the spectrum starts at @xmath258 kev , reaches its maximum value at @xmath259 kev , and steeply cuts off at @xmath260 kev .",
    "this peak corresponds to the radiation into the first harmonic of the ordinary channeling radiation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and there is almost no radiation into higher harmonics .",
    "increasing the @xmath57 ratio leads to the modifications in the radiation spectrum .",
    "the changes which occur are : ( i ) the lowering of the channeling radiation peak , ( ii ) the gradual increase of the intensity of undulator radiation due to the crystal bending .",
    "the decrease in the intensity of the channeling radiation is related to the fact that the increase of the amplitude @xmath3 of the bending leads to lowering of the allowed maximum value of the channeling oscillations amplitude @xmath261 ( this is measured with respect to the centerline of the bent channel ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the more the channel is bent , the lower the allowed values of @xmath261 are , and , consequently , the less intensive is the channeling radiation , which is proportional to @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "the undulator radiation related to the motion of the particle along the centerline of the periodically bent channel is absent in the case of the straight channel ( the graph @xmath253 ) , and is almost invisible for comparatively small amplitudes ( see the graph for @xmath263 ) .",
    "its intensity , which is proportional to @xmath264 , gradually increases with the amplitude @xmath3 . for large @xmath3 values ( @xmath265 )",
    "the intensity of the first harmonic of the undulator radiation becomes larger than that of the channeling radiation .",
    "the undulator peak is located at much lower energies , @xmath266 kev , and has the width @xmath267 kev which is almost 40 times less than the width of the peak of the channeling radiation .",
    "it is important to note that the position of sharp undulator radiation peaks , their narrow widths , and the radiated intensity are , practically , insensitive to the choice of the approximation used to describe the interplanar potential . in addition , provided the first two conditions from ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) are fulfilled , these peaks are well separated ( in the photon energy scale ) from the peaks of the channeling radiation .",
    "therefore , if one is only interested in the spectral distribution of the undulator radiation , one may disregard the channeling oscillations and to assume that the projectile moves along the centerline of the bent channel @xcite .",
    "this statement is illustrated by [ figure9_jpg ] @xcite where we compare the results of different calculations of the radiative spectrum in vicinity of the first harmonic of the undulator radiation in the case @xmath268 .",
    "all parameters are the same as in figure [ figure8_jpg ] .",
    "the filled and open circles represent the results of evaluation of the total spectrum of radiation accompanied by numerical solution of the equations of motion for the projectile within the molire ( filled circles ) and the harmonic ( open circles ) approximations for the interplanar potential .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the undulator radiation only . for the calculation of the latter",
    "it was assumed that the trajectory of a positron , @xmath269 , coincides with the centerline of the bent channel ( see figure [ figure1_jpg ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the more sophisticated treatment has almost no effect on the profile of the peak obtained by means of simple formulae describing purely undulator radiation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the minor changes in the position and the height of the peak can be easily accounted for by introducing the effective undulator parameter and ( in the case of the harmonic approximation ) the effective undulator amplitude @xcite .    to check the numerical method , which was developed in @xcite for the calculation of the total emission spectrum of ultra - relativistic positrons in a crystalline undulator , we calculated the spectrum of the channeling radiation for 6.7 gev positrons in si(110 ) integrated over the emission angles .",
    "figure [ figure10_jpg ] shows the experimental data @xcite and the results of our calculations @xcite normalized to the experimental data at the right wing of the spectrum .",
    "the height of the first harmonic is overestimated in our calculations .",
    "the calculations performed in @xcite gave a similar result .",
    "this disagreement arises likely due to the neglect of multiple collisions which were accounted for neither in @xcite nor in @xcite .",
    "however , the shape and the location of the first harmonic of the channeling radiation are described quite well .",
    "the intensity and the profile of the peaks of the undulator radiation are defined , to a great extent , by the magnitude of the dechanneling length . in @xcite a more sophisticated , than in @xcite , theoretical and numerical analysis of this influence was presented . in particular , we solved the following problems : ( a ) simple analytic expression was evaluated for spectral - angular distribution of the undulator radiation which contains , as a parameter , the dechanneling length @xmath270 , ( b ) the simulation procedure of the dechanneling process of a positron in periodically bent crystals was presented , ( c ) the dechanneling lengths were calculated for 5 gev positrons channeling in si , ge and w crystals along the periodically bent crystallographic planes , ( d ) the spectral - angular and spectral distributions of the undulator radiation formed in crystalline undulator were calculated in a broad range of the photon energies and for various @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath79 .",

    "the spectra correspond to the ratio @xmath57 , where @xmath154  for si and @xmath275  for w. the values of other parameters , used in the calculations , are given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the values of the dechanneling lengths , @xmath271 , were obtained in @xcite by means of the simulation procedure of the dechanneling process of a positron in periodically bent crystals .",
    "the upper figures , [ figure11_jpg](a ) and ( c ) , illustrate the spectral distributions in si and w over a wide range of emitted photon energy , and corresponds to the crystal length , @xmath83 , exceeding the dechanneling length by a factor of 4 : @xmath276 .",
    "each peak corresponds to emission into the odd harmonics , the energies of which follow from the relation @xmath277 , @xmath278 .",
    "the difference in the magnitudes of the undulator parameters for si and w ( see table [ table2 ] ) explains number of the harmonics visible in the spectra .",
    "it is seen that all harmonics are well separated : the distance @xmath279 between two neighbouring peaks is @xmath280 mev for si and @xmath281 mev in the case of w , whilst the width of each peak @xmath282 is @xmath283 kev for si and @xmath284 kev for w.    figures [ figure11_jpg](b ) and ( d ) exhibit , in more detail , the structure of the first - harmonic peaks . for the sake of comparison we plotted the curves corresponding to different values of the undulator periods .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath285 the intensity of the peaks is no longer proportional to @xmath41 , as it is in the case of the ideal undulator without the dechanneling of the particles @xcite . for both si and w crystals ,",
    "the intensities of the radiation calculated at @xmath286 exceed those at @xmath287 ( the thick full curves in the figures ) only by several per cent .",
    "thus , the full curves correspond to almost saturated intensities which are the maximal ones for the crystals used , projectile energies and the parameters of the crystalline undulator . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see paper @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the scheme illustrated by figure [ figure1_jpg ] allows to consider a possibility to generate stimulated emission of high energy photons by means of a bunch of ultra - relativistic positrons moving in a periodically bent channel .",
    "the photons , emitted in the forward direction ( @xmath288 ) at the points of the maximum curvature of the bent channel , travel parallel to the beam and , thus , stimulate the photon generation in the vicinity of all successive maxima and minima .",
    "this mechanism of the radiation stimulation is similar to that known for a free - electron laser ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , in which the periodicity of a trajectory of an ultra - relativistic projectile is achieved by applying a spatially periodic magnetic field . also from the theory of fel",
    "it is known @xcite , that the stimulation occurs at the frequencies of the harmonics of the spontaneous emission , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the frequency of fundamental harmonic , @xmath93 , is defined in ( [ harmonics.1 ] ) . in @xcite and ,",
    "also , in a more recent paper @xcite it was shown , that it is possible to separate the stimulated photon emission in the crystalline undulator from the ordinary channeling radiation in the regime of large bending amplitudes @xmath69 .",
    "this scheme of the stimulated photon emission allows to generate high energy photons up to mev region and , thus , we call it as a gamma - laser . as a further step in developing the ideas proposed in these papers , the study , carried out in @xcite , was devoted to the investigation of the influence of the beam energy spread on the characteristics of the stimulated emission in crystalline undulators .    in the regime of low amplitudes ,",
    "@xmath77 , the idea of using a periodically bent crystal as an undulator for a free electron laser was explored in @xcite . in this regime",
    "the intensity of the undulator radiation is relatively small compared with the channeling radiation .",
    "however , it is possible to match the undulator frequency to that of the channeling motion .",
    "this results in a resonant coupling of the emissions via the two mechanisms , which leads to the enhancement of the gain factor .",
    "let us review the results obtained in @xcite . to do this we first outline the derivation of the general expression for the gain factor in an undulator , and , after accounting for the conditions ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) , estimate gain for the crystalline undulator .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider the stimulated emission for the fundamental harmonic only , and , also , consider the emission in the forward direction . in the formulae below",
    ", we use the notation @xmath44 instead of @xmath93 for the fundamental harmonic frequency .",
    "the gain factor , @xmath289 , defines the increase in the total number , @xmath290 , of the emitted photons at a frequency @xmath291 due to stimulated emission by the particles of the beam : @xmath292 . the general expression for the quantity @xmath289 is @xmath293 , \\label{generalexpressionforgain.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath294 and @xmath295 are the cross sections of , correspondingly , the spontaneous emission and absorption of the photon by a particle of the beam , @xmath296 stands for the volume density ( measured in @xmath297 ) of the beam particles .",
    "by using the known relations between the cross sections @xmath298 and the spectral - angular intensity of the emitted radiation @xcite , one derives the following expression for the gain : @xmath299_{\\vartheta=0 } \\ , \\delta \\omega \\ , \\delta\\omega .",
    "\\label{generalexpressionforgain.4}\\ ] ] here @xmath300 is the spectral - angular intensity of the radiation , @xmath301 is the width of the first harmonic peak , and @xmath302 is the effective cone ( with respect to the undulator axis ) into which the emission of the @xmath44-photon occurs .",
    "note that expression ( [ generalexpressionforgain.4 ] ) is derived under the assumption that the photon energy is small compared to the energy of the particle , @xmath303 .    for an undulator of the length @xmath83",
    "the total increase in the number of photons is @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the total gain on the scale @xmath83 .",
    "the expression for @xmath306 follows from ( [ generalexpressionforgain.4 ] ) ( the details of derivation one finds in @xcite ) : @xmath307 where @xmath308 cm is the electron classical radius , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the charge and the mass of a projectile in the units of elementary charge and electron mass .",
    "note the strong inverse dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath126 which is due to the radiative recoil , and the proportionality of the gain to @xmath309 and to the squared charge of the projectile @xmath310 .",
    "the main difference , of a principal character , between a conventional fel and a fel - type device based on a crystalline undulator is that in the former the bunch of particles and the photon flux both travel in vacuum whereas in the latter they propagate in a crystalline medium .",
    "consequently , in a conventional fel one can , in principle , increase infinitely the length of the undulator @xmath83 .",
    "this will result in the increase of the total gain and the number of undulator periods @xmath42 , ( [ condition.2 ] ) .",
    "the limitations on the magnitude of @xmath83 in this case are mainly of a technological nature .",
    "the situation is different for a crystalline undulator , where the dechanneling effect and the photon attenuation lead to the decrease of @xmath296 and of the photon flux density with the penetration length and , therefore , result in the limitation of the allowed @xmath83-values .",
    "the reasonable estimate of @xmath83 is given by the condition ( [ conditions.5 ] ) . in turn , this condition , together with the estimate ( [ condition.la ] ) , defines the ranges of photon energies for which the operation of a crystalline undulator is realistic .",
    "these ranges are :    * high - energy photons : @xmath311 kev when @xmath312 cm ; * low - energy photons : @xmath313 ev .    in the regime of high - energy photons ( the gamma - laser regime )",
    "the stimulation of the emission must occur during a single pass of the bunch of the particles through the crystal .",
    "indeed , for such photon energies there are no mirrors , and , therefore , the photon flux must develop simultaneously with the bunch propagation . in the theory of fel this principle is called self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) @xcite and is usually referred as the fel operation in the high gain regime , which implies that @xmath314 to ensure that the exponential factor in ( [ generalexpressionforgain.5 ] ) is large . in this case",
    "the quantity @xmath315 denotes the number of photons which appear due to the spontaneous emission at the entrance part of the undulator .    for @xmath313 ev there is no principal necessity to go beyond 1 for the magnitude of @xmath306 during a single pass .",
    "indeed , for such photons there is a possibility to use mirrors to reflect the photons .",
    "therefore , the emitted photons , after leaving the undulator can be returned back to the entrance point to be used for further stimulation of the emission by the incoming projectiles .    below we present the results of numerical calculations of the parameters of the undulator ( the first harmonic energy and the number of periods ) and of the volume density @xmath296 of the bunch particles needed to achieve @xmath316 .",
    "the calculations were performed for relativistic positrons , muons , protons and heavy ions and took into account all the conditions summarized in ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) .",
    "the results presented correspond to the cases of the lowest values of @xmath296 needed to ensure @xmath316 and which , simultaneously , produce the largest available values of @xmath42 .",
    "detailed analysis of the conditions ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) and demonstrates , that to optimize the parameters of the stimulated emission in the photon energy range @xmath311 kev in the case of a positron channeling in a periodically bent crystal one should consider the following ranges of parameters : @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 , which are common for all the crystals which we have investigated . for these ranges the energy of the first harmonic ( see ( [ harmonics.1 ] ) )",
    "lies within the interval @xmath186 kev , and the length of the undulator can be taken equal to the dechanneling length because of the inequality @xmath320 , valid for such @xmath44 .",
    "results of calculations are presented in figure [ figure12_jpg ] , where the dependences of the first harmonic energy , @xmath321 , the number of undulator periods , @xmath42 , and the ratio @xmath322 versus the parameter @xmath79 ( see ( [ condition.1 ] ) ) are presented for various crystals .",
    "the data correspond to the ratio @xmath323 except for the case of si for which @xmath268 .    for each crystal",
    "the curves @xmath321 and @xmath322 were truncated at those @xmath79 values for which the number of undulator periods becomes less than 10 ( see the graph in the middle ) .",
    "it is seen from the bottom graph , that @xmath322 is a rapidly varying function of @xmath79 ( note the log scale of the vertical axis ) .",
    "for all the channels this function attains its maximum value @xmath324 @xmath325 at @xmath326 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath322 defines the magnitude of the volume density of a positron bunch needed to achieve total gain @xmath316 .",
    "then it follows from the graph that to achieve the emission stimulation within the range @xmath327 kev on the basis of the sase mechanism it is necessary to reach the value @xmath328 @xmath297 for a positron bunch of the energy of several gev .    at first glance the idea of using a crystalline undulator based on the channeling of heavy positively charged particles looks very attractive .",
    "indeed , as it is seen from ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.3 ] ) , ( [ dechannnelingattenuation.4 ] ) and ( [ condition.ld ] ) , the dechanneling length for a heavy particle is @xmath329 times larger than that for a positron with the same value of @xmath15 .",
    "this factor , being cubed in ( [ generalexpressionforgain.6 ] ) , could lead to a noticeable increase of the total gain ( over - forcing , in the cases of @xmath330 and @xmath18 , the small multiplier @xmath331 ) .",
    "however , as it is seen from ( [ condition.1 ] ) the allowed undulator period @xmath4 increases with a projectile mass : @xmath332 . in turn , this results in a decrease in the first harmonic energy @xmath333 ( in the case of a heavy projectile the undulator parameter is small , and the term @xmath334 can be disregarded when calculating @xmath44 , see ( [ harmonics.1 ] ) ) .",
    "for realistic values of relativistic factor , @xmath335 , this results in the following restriction on the photon energy : @xmath336 for a proton and an ion the range of photon energies is exactly the one where the attenuation is very strong .",
    "therefore , the crystal length is defined by a small value of @xmath161 , see figure [ figure6_jpg ] . in the case of @xmath330",
    "the upper limit of @xmath321 is higher but , nevertheless , it leads to a condition @xmath337 , so that the crystal length also must be chosen as @xmath338 .",
    "although in such conditions it is possible to construct an undulator with sufficiently large number of periods , the total gain factor becomes very small : @xmath339 therefore , it is not realistic to consider the stimulated emission from a heavy projectile in the high - energy photon range .",
    "for @xmath340 the photon attenuation becomes small and the length of the undulator is defined by the dechanneling length of a particle .    to illustrate the regime of low - energy stimulated emission during the positron channeling , in figure [ figure13_jpg ] we present the dependences of @xmath42 and @xmath322 on the relativistic factor .",
    "the data correspond to a fixed ratio @xmath341 and to a fixed energy of the first harmonic , @xmath342 ev , which is lower than the atomic ionization potentials for all crystals indicated in the figures .",
    "the undulator length was chosen to be equal to the dechanneling length , which is the minimum from @xmath271 and @xmath161 .",
    "two graphs in figure [ figure13_jpg ] demonstrate , that although the number of the undulator periods is , approximately , independent on the type of the crystal , the magnitude of the total gain is quite sensitive to the choice of the channel .",
    "the highest values of @xmath322 ( and , correspondingly , the lowest densities @xmath296 needed to achieve @xmath316 ) can be achieved for heavy crystals .",
    "analysis of ( [ generalexpressionforgain.6 ] ) together with ( [ allconditions.1 ] ) shows , that , in the case of a heavy projectile , to obtain the largest possible values of the total gain @xmath306 during a single pass through a crystal the following regime can be considered : ( a ) moderate values of the relativistic factor , @xmath343 ; ( b ) @xmath344 which turns out to be the optimal value of @xmath79 ; ( c ) @xmath345 , i.e. the best choice is to use a bunch of heavy ions .",
    "in figure [ figure14_jpg ] we present the dependences of @xmath42 and @xmath322 on @xmath15 , lying within the range specified above .",
    "all curves , which were obtained for different @xmath57 ratios , refer to the case of @xmath346 channeling in @xmath150 along the @xmath141 crystallographic planes .",
    "the energy of the emitted photon is fixed at @xmath140 ev .",
    "it is seen from the graphs that for all the crystals the most optimal range of relativistic factor is @xmath347 where both the number of the undulator periods and the magnitude of @xmath322 noticeably exceed the corresponding values in the case of a positron channeling , see figure [ figure13_jpg ] .",
    "similar analysis , carried out for the case of a proton channeling , demonstrates that for the same value of @xmath15 the magnitudes of @xmath322 are several times higher than those for a heavy ion .",
    "results presented in this section show , that the stimulated emission in the low-@xmath44 range ( @xmath348 ev ) can be discussed for all types of positively - charged projectiles . in this case to achieve the value @xmath316 within the sase mode it is necessary to consider the densities from @xmath349 @xmath297 for heavy ion beams up to @xmath350 @xmath297 for a positron beam .",
    "however , this large numbers can be reduced by orders of magnitudes if one considers the multi - pass mode of the fel . indeed",
    ", there exist the mirrors which allow to reflect photons of the energy @xmath348 ev .",
    "thus , the emitted photons can be returned back to the entrance point and used further to stimulate the emission generated by the particles of the long bunch .",
    "the number of the passes , equal approximately to @xmath351 ( here @xmath352 is the bunch length ) , can be very large ( up to @xmath353 ) .",
    "therefore , volume density can be reduced by the factor @xmath354 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the feasibility of the crystalline undulator and gamma - laser based on it .",
    "we have presented the detailed review covering the development of all essential aspects of these important ideas .",
    "firstly , we note that it is absolutely realistic to use a crystalline undulator for generating _ spontaneous _ radiation in a wide range of photon energies .",
    "the parameters of such an undulator , being subject to the restrictions mentioned in section [ conditions ] , can be easily tuned by varying the shape function , the energy and the type of a projectile and by choosing different channels .",
    "the large range of energies available in modern colliders for various charged particles , both light and heavy , together with the wide range of frequencies and bending amplitudes in crystals allow to generate the crystalline undulator radiation with the energies from ev up to the mev region .",
    "secondly , it is feasible to obtain _ stimulated _ emission by means of a crystalline undulator . for a single - pass laser ( sase mode )",
    "high volume densities are needed : the stimulated emission in the high-@xmath44 range ( @xmath355 kev ) demands high volume densities of positrons , @xmath356 @xmath297 . for this values of @xmath296",
    "a fel device based on a crystalline undulator can be operated in a single - pass ( sase ) mode",
    ".    stimulated emission in the low-@xmath44 range ( @xmath348 ev ) can be discussed for all types of positively - charged projectiles . in this case the large values of the beam densities required for the lasing effect can be reduced by orders of magnitudes if one considers the multi - pass mode of the fel .",
    "indeed , there exist the mirrors which allow to reflect photons of the energy @xmath348 ev .",
    "thus , the emitted photons can be returned back to the entrance point and used further to stimulate the emission generated by the particles of the long bunch .",
    "the number of the passes , equal approximately to @xmath351 ( here @xmath352 is the bunch length ) , can be very large ( up to @xmath353 ) .",
    "therefore , beam density at which the lasing effect arises can be reduced by the factor @xmath354 .",
    "the crystalline undulators discussed in this paper can serve as a new efficient source for the coherent high energy photon emission . as we have pointed out , the present technology is nearly sufficient to achieve the necessary conditions to construct not only crystalline undulator , but also the stimulated photon emission source .",
    "the parameters of the crystalline undulator and the gamma - laser based on it differ substantially from what is possible to achieve with the undulators constructed on magnetic fields .",
    "this review clearly demonstrates that experimental effots are needed for the verification of numerous theory predications outlined in this review .",
    "such efforts will certainly make this field of endevour even more facinating than as it is now and possibly will lead to the practical development of a new type of tunable and monochromatic radiation sources .    finally , we mention that not at all theoretical issues for the described system have been solved so far .",
    "thus , the analysys of dynamics of a high - density positon beam channeling through a periodically bent crystal in presence of an induced high intensity photon flux is to be performed in a greater detail .",
    "this and many more other interesting theoretical problems are still open for future investigation .",
