    "the kinematic configuration of the local group ( lg ) is not common in the cosmological context provided by the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "the lg is dominated by the presence of two spiral galaxies , the milky way ( mw ) and m31 .",
    "it is relatively isolated of other massive structures ; the next most luminous galaxy is 10 times less massive than m31 , with several dwarf galaxies around a sphere of @xmath1mpc and the closest massive galaxy cluster , the virgo cluster , is 16.5 mpc away .",
    "the velocity vector of m31 has a low tangential component and is consistent with a head - on collision toward the mw , and the velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies up to @xmath2 mpc is relatively low .",
    "these features make lg analogues uncommon in numerical simulations . only about of @xmath3 of mw - sized halos",
    "reside in a pair similar to the mw - m31 in a similar environment .",
    "additionally , the strong alignments of dwarf satellites of the mw and m31 in the form of polar and planar structures calls asks for a detailed explanation of the large scale structure environment that can breed such halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we present results of the study of the large scale environment of lg analogues in the context of @xmath0cdm .",
    "we use a cosmological n - body simulation ( bolshoi ) to infer the most probable place of the lg in the cosmic web and its alignments .",
    "a detailed description of these results can found in @xcite .",
    "we use a web finding algorithm based on the tidal tensor computed from the gravitational potential field computed over a grid .",
    "we define the tensor as :    @xmath4    where the index @xmath5 refers to the three spatial directions in euclidean space and @xmath6 is a normalized gravitational potential that satisfies the following poisson equation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dark matter overdensity .",
    "the algorithm finds the eigenvalues of this tensor , @xmath9 , and use them to classify each cell in the grid as a peak , filament , sheet or void if three , two , one or none of the eigenvectors is larger than a given threshold @xmath10 .",
    "each eigenvalue has associated to it an eigenvector ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) which are the natural basis to define local directions in the web .",
    "details describing the algorithm can be found in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the dark matter density is interpolated over a grid with cells of size @xmath14 and smoothed with a gaussian filter with the same spatial scale .",
    "we use a threshold of @xmath15 to define the different cosmic web environments .",
    "we use the bolshoi simulation with a @xmath0cdm cosmology described by the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation followed the evolution of dark matter in a @xmath20 box with spatial resolution of @xmath21  kpc and mass resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "halos are identified with the bound density maxima ( bdm ) algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data for the halos and the cosmic web are available through a public database located at http://www.cosmosim.org/. a detailed description of the database structure was presented by @xcite .",
    "we construct a sample of mw - m31 pairs at @xmath23 by using multiple snapshots from the simulation asking for consistency with the following criteria :    * relative distance .",
    "the distance between the center of mass of each halo in the pair can not be larger than @xmath24 mpc . * individual halo mass .",
    "each halo has a mass in the mass range @xmath25 . *",
    "no neighboring halos more massive than either pair member can be found within @xmath26mpc . * isolation from virgo - like halos .",
    "no dark matter halos with mass @xmath27 within @xmath28mpc .    with these selection criteria we select close to @xmath29 pairs to build a general sample ( gs ) .",
    "from the gs we select two sub - samples according to the tolerance in kinematic constraints .",
    "these sub - samples are named @xmath30 and @xmath31 , they correspond to a tolerance of two and three times the observational errors in the radial velocity , tangential velocity and separation .",
    "the number of pairs in each sample is @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "sample . the preferred environments are filaments and sheets.,width=336 ]     and @xmath31 samples .",
    "the preferred overdensity is in the interval @xmath34.,width=336 ]     showing the alignment of the vector joining the two halos in the lg with the smallest tidal eigenvector .",
    "the shaded regions represents the expected result from a distribution of vectors randomly placed in space and the corresponding @xmath35 and @xmath36 percentiles for distributions with the same number of points as the @xmath30 sample.,width=336 ]     for the vector @xmath37 that indicates the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the pair.,width=336 ]    we find that the pairs in the general sample are located across different environments with a strong dependence on the total pair mass .",
    "figure [ fig : environment ] summarizes this correlation between environment and mass .",
    "each line represents the distribution of pairs in the four different environments .",
    "high mass pairs are mostly located in peaks and filaments while less massive ones in voids and sheets .",
    "the shaded regions represent the @xmath38 confidence intervals of the mass distributions in the @xmath30 sample . by and large the lgs in the @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "samples are located in filaments and sheets . in both samples , @xmath39 of the pairs",
    "can be found in filaments while @xmath40 are in sheets .",
    "we can also characterize the preferred place of the pair samples in terms of the web overdensity .",
    "figure [ fig : overdensity ] shows the values of the overdensity as a function of the total pair mass .",
    "the gs and its uncertainties are represented by the shaded region .",
    "the symbols represent the results for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 samples .",
    "we see that the range of values for the restricted samples samples are completely expected from the mass constraint alone .",
    "higher mass pairs are located in high density regions .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 samples have narrower mass range and are located within a narrower range of overdensities @xmath41 peaking at @xmath42 .",
    "there is wide evidence showing that dm halo formation properties only depend on environment through the local dm density . whether they are located in sheet or a filament",
    "is irrelevant as long the local density is the same .",
    "however there is long history of alignment measurement ( shape , spin , peculiar velocities ) of individual halos with the cosmic web . in a recent",
    "paper @xcite presented a study using the same simulation and cosmic web definition we use here .",
    "they also presented a comprehensive review of all the previous results from simulations that also inspected the alignment of halo shape and spin .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper for a complete list of references .",
    "the main results from the study in @xcite is that the halo shape presents the strongest alignment signal . in this case",
    "the dm halo major axis lies along the smallest eigenvector @xmath13 , regardless of the web environment .",
    "this alignments is stronger for higher halo masses .",
    "concerning spin alignment the simulations show a weak anti - alignment with respect to @xmath13 for halo masses larger that @xmath43 , and no alignment signal for masses below that threshold .",
    "the peculiar velocities show a strong alignment signal along @xmath13 for all masses .    in our case",
    "we test for the alignment of the vector connecting the two halos ( @xmath44 ) , the orbital angular momentum of the pair ( @xmath45 ) and the spin of each halo .",
    "we quantify the alignment using the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between two vectors @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "the results for the first two alignments are summarized in figures [ fig : alignment_r ] and [ fig : alignment_n ] .",
    "we find that the vector @xmath44 is strongly aligned with @xmath48 , along filaments and sheets .",
    "this trend is already present in the gs and gets stronger for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 samples .",
    "concerning the vector @xmath45 we have a strong anti - correlation with @xmath49 , again this tendency is stronger for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 samples .",
    "here , we have presented results on the expected place of the local group in the cosmic web . our results are based on cosmological n - body simulations and the tidal web method to define the cosmic web .",
    "we constructed different local groups samples from dark matter halo pairs that fulfill observational kinematic constraints .",
    "we found a tight correlation of the lg pairs total mass with the local overdensity .",
    "for the lg pairs closer to the observational constraints their total mass is in the range @xmath50 preferred overdensity value is constrained to be in the range @xmath51 .",
    "this restricts the preferred environment to be filaments and sheets .",
    "we also found strong alignments of the pairs with the cosmic web .",
    "the strongest alignment is present for the vector joining the two lg halos .",
    "this vector is aligned with the lowest eigenvector and anti - aligned with the highest eigenvector .",
    "this trend is already present in wide sample of pairs and becomes stronger as the kinematic constraints are closer to their observed values .",
    "these results raise the need to use observations to constraint the alignments of lg pairs with their cosmic web environment .",
    "there are many algorithms available to reconstruct the dm distribution from large galaxy surveys to tackle this task .",
    "this would allow a direct quantification of how common are the lg alignments we have found , providing a potential new test for @xmath0cdm ."
