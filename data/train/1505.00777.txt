    "the declining light curves of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , as well as some core - collapse sne , are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath7 , which releases @xmath8-rays that thermalize with the expanding ejecta , to be re - emitted in the optical and near - infrared @xcite . as the ejecta continue to expand , the column density decreases so that the ejecta become progressively more transparent to @xmath8-rays . however",
    ", 19% of @xmath9 decays proceed via positron emission , and after @xmath10 days these positrons become the dominant energy source and continue to heat the ejecta ( e.g. , ) . assuming 100% trapping of the positrons emitted by these decays , the observed light curves of sne ia 300600 days after explosion ( e.g. , ) are consistent with the decay of @xmath5co .",
    "however , the apparent slow - down of sn ia light curves past 800 days , as seen in , e.g. , sn 1992a , sn 2003hv , and sn 2011fe @xcite , indicates that even complete trapping of the @xmath5co positrons can not explain the observed luminosity ; additional radioactive heating channels may be required .",
    "@xcite suggested that the slower decays of @xmath0 ( @xmath11 days ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 days ) will produce internal - conversion electrons , auger electrons , and x - rays that would largely be trapped , deposit their energy , and slow down the decline of the light curve beginning @xmath14 days after maximum light .    while there is a wide consensus that sne ia are the result of a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon  oxygen white dwarf",
    ", it is still unclear how the white dwarf is detonated and consumed ( for a recent review , see ) .",
    "@xcite have used the leptonic energy injection mechanisms due to the decays of @xmath3co and @xmath15fe described above to provide a testable prediction for two popular sn ia explosion scenarios : the `` delayed - detonation '' and `` violent merger '' models . in the first scenario , a white dwarf with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath16 m@xmath17 )",
    "first goes through a subsonic deflagration phase before transitioning to a supersonic detonation . in the second scenario ,",
    "the white dwarf detonates due to a merger with a second , slightly lower - mass white dwarf , and both stars have sub - chandra masses ( 1.1 and 0.9 m@xmath17 ) .",
    "each of these scenarios predicts that different amounts of @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be created during the explosion .",
    "for example , in the merger scenario , where the densities of the white dwarfs are @xmath20 g @xmath21 , most of the iron - group elements , including @xmath22 ( which then decays to the longer - lived @xmath19 ) , are produced in incomplete si burning and @xmath23-rich freezeout from nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , the higher density of the delayed - detonation white dwarf leads to `` normal '' freezout ( which sets in at @xmath24 g @xmath21 ) , which produces more @xmath22 .",
    "the different abundances of @xmath19 and @xmath18 then lead to bolometric light curves with appreciably different slopes at @xmath25 days after maximum light .",
    "the late - time observations of the core - collapse sne 1998bw @xcite and 1987a @xcite were shown to be consistent with the leptonic heating mechanism suggested by @xcite .",
    "when this paper was submitted , this prediction had not been tested for any normal sn ia ( e.g. , sn 2001el , observed by , as well as the sne ia collected by @xcite and @xcite , only go out to @xmath26 days after explosion ) .",
    "tantalizingly , the very last data points on the light curves of sn 1992a ( @xmath27 days ; ) and sn 2003hv ( @xmath28 days ; ) might be showing the beginning of a slow - down of their optical light curves .",
    "very recently , @xcite published their analysis of the spectrum of sn 2011fe taken 1034 days after explosion by @xcite . at this epoch , they find strong evidence of the need for energy injection by @xmath3co and , in order to reproduce the observed flux level of the spectrum , require a production ratio of @xmath29 that is roughly @xmath30 times solar . here , we test the predictions made by @xcite and @xcite by following the late - time lightcurve of the sn ia sn 2012cg .",
    "sn 2012cg was discovered on 2012 may 17 ( ut ) in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 4424 ( at a stellar - kinematics based distance of @xmath31 mpc ; @xcite ) by the lick observatory supernova search @xcite and spectroscopically classified as a sn ia by @xcite and @xcite . _ hubble space telescope _",

    "@xmath8-rays are essentially free - streaming and their contribution to the heating is negligible . 2 .   positrons , electrons , and x - rays are fully trapped and instantaneously deposit all their energy .",

    "we show the luminosity contributions from each decay chain in figure  [ fig : bateman ] . restricting the fit to account only for @xmath5co and @xmath3co results in the same @xmath5co mass but a mass ratio of @xmath95 , larger by a factor of @xmath96 ( with a @xmath64 value of @xmath97 ) .",

    "the mass ratio we measure here is roughly twice the corresponding @xmath3fe/@xmath5fe ratio measured for the sun .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the predictions of near-@xmath102 explosion models : w7 of @xcite predicts 1.7 times solar , the pure turbulent deflagration models of @xcite predict @xmath103 times solar , the delayed - detonation models of co wds of @xcite predict @xmath104 times solar , the delayed - detonation models of wds with carbon - depleted cores of predict @xmath105 times solar , and the gravitationally confined detonation models of @xcite predict 0.81.2 times solar .",
    "there is a trend that models with larger progenitor metallicity ( see @xcite ) and models that experience enhanced in - situ neutronization ( e.g. , w7 ) yield higher @xmath3ni/@xmath5ni ratios .",
    "this is naturally explained by the fact that @xmath3ni is a neutron - rich isotope ( 28 protons , 29 neutrons ) and its production relative to the self - conjugate @xmath5ni ( 28 protons , 28 neutrons ) therefore tends to be enhanced in neutron - rich environments .",
    "model yields where the primary wd is significantly less massive than @xmath102 predict even lower @xmath3ni/@xmath5ni ratios : the merger model of a @xmath106 co wd with a @xmath107 co wd of @xcite predicts @xmath105 times solar and the pure detonation models of co and one wds of predict around 0.30.5 times solar .    have found that the @xmath3ni/@xmath5ni production ratio is very robust ( at the 10% level ) to individual changes of nuclear reaction rates by a factor of 10 ; rate uncertainties are therefore unlikely to solely account for the difference .",
    "therefore , the high @xmath3co/@xmath5co ratio we find appears to point toward a near-@xmath102 progenitor .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite , who interpret the observed early uv excess of sn 2012cg as evidence that the sn occurred as an explosion of a near-@xmath102 wd in the single - degenerate channel .",
    "light echoes have been found for other sne ia at similar phases hundreds of days after their explosion , e.g. , sn1991 t @xcite , sn1995e @xcite , sn1998bu @xcite , sn2006x @xcite , sn2007af @xcite , and sn2014j @xcite .",
    "typically , these light echoes were between 1012 mag fainter than the sne at peak .",
    "due to observational bias , these observed light echoes are at the bright tail of the distribution of expected light - echo brightnesses @xcite .",
    "therefore , the excess flux of sn 2012cg at @xmath45 days , which is @xmath4 mag fainter than the sn at peak , is consistent with a light echo . in the following ,",
    "we investigate this possibility in more detail .",
    "there is no evidence of a resolved light echo at the location of sn 2012cg in the three @xmath45-day epochs . using dolphot , a modified version of hstphot @xcite",
    ", we subtracted a model of the _ f350lp _ point - spread function ( psf ) from the location of the sn . in each epoch , a visual inspection of the residual map produced by dolphot revealed no resolved features . to quantify this statement , we compared the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the pixel values at the location of the psf - subtracted sn , measured in rectangular apertures of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 pixels@xmath111 , to the distribution of rms values measured in 100 apertures at random locations up to 15 pixels away in any direction from the sn . in each of the three epochs ,",
    "the rms value was within the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distribution , i.e. , consistent with the background noise .",
    "we now address the possibility of a non - resolved light echo within the psf .",
    "let us first consider the shape of the light curve . as we have argued above",
    ", the observed excess flux surface brightness is well within the range expected for light echoes . with the reasonable assumption that the scattering dust structures do not vary significantly on the length scales associated with the light echo ,",
    "the surface brightness of light echoes decays as @xmath88 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as the light echo is not resolved , we must also take into account that its angular size , which is proportional to the circumference , increases with time , so that the light echo should fade as @xmath112 .",
    "we test this hypothesis by fitting a combination of @xmath5co decay and a light echo decaying as @xmath112 to the data , with the light echo normalization set as a free parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : le ] shows that this model , with @xmath113 , fits the data well .",
    "next , we consider whether the observed colors are consistent with the light echo above . light - echo flux is dominated by the light of the sn around peak , so to first order the color of the light echo is similar to the color of the sn at peak .",
    "in addition , the scattering by the dust favors blue light , which can shift the color of the light curve bluewards by a few tenths of a magnitude , depending on the scattering angle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at @xmath114 days ,",
    "@xcite measure @xmath115 mag ( vega , corrected for galactic extinction ) .",
    "our photometry allows us to measure the _",
    "f555w_@xmath116_f814w _ color ( similar to @xmath117 ) of sn 2012cg at 570640 days . as our _ f555w _ and",
    "_ f814w _ measurements were not taken on the same days , we use the python astroml package @xcite to perform gaussian process regression and measure the color at any phase within this range . at 600 days , we measure @xmath118 mag ( vega , corrected for galactic extinction ) . hence , at 600 days , sn 2012cg was redder than it was at peak .",
    "however , at 600 days there is no excess flux , assuming the light curve is powered solely by @xmath5co decay ( see figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the combination of @xmath5co decay and a faint light echo shown in figure  [ fig : le ] would mean a flux excess of 11% , relative to the @xmath5co component .",
    "therefore , any contamination by a faint light echo would only minimally change the observed combined color .",
    "thus , the observed color of sn 2012cg at 600 days is consistent with either no light echo or a light echo faint enough that it leaves no trace at this phase . at @xmath45 days , where the excess flux dominates the observed flux and the light - echo hypothesis could be tested best with the color",
    ", we only have observations in one filter .    co decay ( blue dashed ) and a faint light echo that decays as @xmath112 ( orange dotted - dashed ) can combine ( black solid ) to fit the _",
    "f350lp _ measurements ( white squares ) .",
    "the dotted red curve shows the maximal contribution to the sn light from a red - giant or @xmath119 main - sequence binary companion , according to @xmath120 upper limits on the luminosity of such a companion measured from  pre - explosion images.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    without much fine - tuning , a light echo can explain the observed colors and light - curve shape .",
    "thus , with no spectrum or color information at late times , we can not conclusively rule out contamination of our measurements by a light echo .",
    "it is a coincidence of nature that the functional forms of the light - echo and @xmath3co - decay luminosities exhibit the same behavior in the time range probed here , as can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig : bateman ] and [ fig : le ] .",
    "unfortunately , further observations of sn 2012cg can not inform this issue .",
    "our final _",
    "measurement already had a signal - to - noise ratio of 3.3 ; by now , the sn should be as faint or fainter than the background light of ngc 4424 .      to test whether our measurements at @xmath69 days indicate that the sn had faded to the point where a surviving binary companion could shine through , we first fit all _ f350lp _ measurements with a combination of an exponential function , for the sn light curve , and a constant luminosity from the presumptive companion .",
    "the best - fitting companion has a luminosity of @xmath121 ( @xmath122 , consistent with a red giant .",
    "however , pre - explosion  wide - field planetary camera 2 images of the location of the sn have produced @xmath120 upper limits of @xmath123 and @xmath124 mag @xcite . taking into account galactic and host - galaxy extinctions for these filters results in a @xmath120 upper limit on the _ f350lp _ luminosity of a companion star of @xmath125 , as shown in figure  [ fig : le ]",
    "such a luminosity is consistent with either a red giant or a @xmath119 main - sequence star , but constitutes only @xmath126% of our measured _",
    "f350lp _ luminosities at @xmath69 days .",
    "our upper limit is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite that the pre - maximum uv excess observed in sn 2012cg is the possible signature of interaction between the sn ejecta and a @xmath127 main - sequence companion .",
    "we conclude that , while we can not rule out the presence of a surviving companion star , even if it is present , its contribution to the light curve is still negligible .",
    "in conclusion , observations of the sn ia sn 2012cg more than 900 days after its explosion allow us to reject , at a significance of @xmath73% ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) , the null hypothesis that the light curve of this sn ia is powered solely by the radioactive decay chain @xmath7 . instead , we have shown that our measurements are consistent with predictions that at these late times , the light curve becomes dominated by reprocessing of internal - conversion and auger electrons , as well as x - rays , emitted by the decay of @xmath3co into @xmath3fe , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "this constitutes the first evidence for the synthesis of radioactive @xmath3co during a sn ia explosion .",
    "we have tested whether the late - time behavior of the light curve of sn 2012cg could be due to contamination by either a light echo or the luminosity from a surviving binary companion .",
    "pre - explosion imaging sets an upper limit on the latter , which makes it a negligible source of contamination .",
    "a combination of @xmath5co decay and a faint light echo , @xmath4 mag fainter than sn 2012cg at peak , fits the data well . unfortunately , without spectra or colors at late times , we can not rule out the possibility of light - echo contamination .    assuming no contamination by light echoes",
    ", we have measured a ratio of @xmath6 between the masses of @xmath3co and @xmath5co produced by the decay of ni isotopes synthesized in the explosion .",
    "this ratio , which is roughly twice the corresponding solar @xmath3fe/@xmath5fe ratio , implies that the progenitor of this sn was probably a near-@xmath102 wd .",
    "after this paper was submitted , @xcite found that a ratio @xmath128 times the solar value was required to fit a spectrum of sn 2011fe @xmath90 days after explosion .",
    "it remains to be seen whether observations of other sne ia at such late times provide similar ratios and whether sn ia light curves @xmath129 days after explosion will reveal conclusive evidence of similar leptonic energy - injection channels from the decay of the longer - lived @xmath15fe .",
