    "quantum metrology is an important branch of science that promises many advances in precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the importance of quantum metrology stems from the fact that an optimally designed quantum measurement always outperforms the analogous classical measurement .",
    "a typical measurement scheme involves a probe system @xmath1 prepared in an initial quantum state @xmath2 undergoing a unitary transformation to the state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is some hermitian operator generating translations in the parameter @xmath5 we wish to estimate .",
    "most of the measurement schemes employ linear operators to generate parameter shifts .",
    "for example , in quantum optics we usually have @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon number operator .",
    "however , more generally , the parameter shift @xmath5 can be generated by an optical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the generator @xmath4 is a nonlinear function of the photon number operator @xmath7 such as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the order of the nonlinearity . following the evolution ,",
    "the probe system @xmath1 is subjected to a generalized measurement @xmath10 , described by some positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) that consists of elements @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the measurement outcome used to make an estimate @xmath13 of value of @xmath5 .",
    "given the probability distribution of the measurement data @xmath14 $ ] , the performance of a parameter estimation scheme can be bounded by the quantum cramr - rao bound @xmath15}}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the square root of the mean - square error with the average taken over all possible measurement outcomes , @xmath17 denotes the number of measurement repetitions and @xmath18 $ ] is the quantum fisher information @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the quantum cramr - rao bound is valid _ only _ for unbiased estimators , and therefore should be used with caution ( for more details on the limitations of the cramr - rao bound see sec .",

    "@xcite and for alternative bounds see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that in the case of linear parameter estimation schemes , the error @xmath19 scales at best with the heisenberg - limited sensitivity as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the average number of photons used in the scheme .",
    "this scaling represents a significant @xmath22 improvement with respect to the classical shot - noise limit .",
    "however , there is one complication : this improvement is only present in _ noiseless _ measurement schemes . since all precision measurements suffer from some form of noise it is of the utmost importance to find the fundamental precision bounds that hold in realistic noisy conditions .",
    "so far the analysis of noisy measurement schemes was limited only to schemes governed by linear generators leading to some very pessimistic results @xcite .",
    "although , under certain circumstances such as the presence of non - markovian environments @xcite , or frequency estimation with transversal noise @xcite , some improvement in the precision with respect to the shot - noise limit can be observed . in our study , we derive the ultimate bounds on the performance of noisy nonlinear measurement schemes and determine whether such schemes can offer any improvement with respect to their noisy linear counterparts .",
    "in particular , we investigate the performance of the second - order estimation scheme in the presence of the two most common types of noise , photon loss and phase diffusion , using a number of different techniques @xcite .",
    "while photon loss is typically considered the most dominant source of noise for optical quantum systems , in atomic clocks , for example , phase fluctuations may be more important @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec::loss ] and  [ sec::diffusion ] we derive the ultimate precision bounds for the second - order estimation scheme plagued by photon loss and phase - diffusion noise . furthermore ,",
    "in the section on photon loss we make a comparison with other methods used in lossy quantum metrology @xcite and in the section on phase diffusion we investigate a possible improvement to the performance in a situation when we have some control over the initial state of the environment .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks .",
    "in idealized noiseless measurement schemes it is typically assumed that the probe system @xmath1 evolves under unitary conditions",
    ". however , in practice it is impossible to separate the probe system @xmath1 from its environment @xmath23 , which leads to an unavoidable leakage of information about the parameter @xmath5 to the environment @xcite .",
    "the nonunitary evolution of the probe system in noisy conditions may be described in terms of the kraus operators @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "we further assume that the kraus operators act on the constituents of the probe in a nontrivial nonlinear way .",
    "depending on the order of nonlinearity this dynamical evolution can be highly complicated @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , it is often assumed ( although we do not make any such assumptions in this work ) that @xmath27 where @xmath24 is a @xmath5-independent kraus operator that describes only the noise process , which may nevertheless affect the constituents of the probe in some nontrivial nonlinear way , and @xmath28 with @xmath4 denoting a nonlinear operator generating translations in the parameter @xmath5 . in calling @xmath4 nonlinear , we mean that it scales nonlinearly with the size of the system .",
    "for example , in quantum optics , the parameter shift can be generated by a combination of optical nonlinearities and multiple passes expressed as a nonlinear function of the photon number operators @xmath29 in each mode : @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the number of passes through the @xmath5-dependent medium experienced by the @xmath32th mode and @xmath9 is the order of the nonlinearity @xcite .",

    "we also briefly note that the lower bounds on the error of the second - order estimation scheme in the presence of _ second - order _ phase - diffusion noise qualitatively coincide with the lower bounds derived in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath145\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 denotes the strength of the second - order phase - diffusion noise .",
    "this bound holds for any input probe state and for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , in this scenario the protection against the phase - diffusion noise introduced above is possible for any input probe state .",
    "the corresponding bounds are @xmath147}}\\ , , \\\\ & & \\delta \\phi_{\\rm spd}^{n , n_{e } \\rightarrow \\infty } \\geq \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{2 } n^{1/2}_{e } } + \\mathcal{o}\\left[\\frac{1}{n^2 } , \\frac{1}{n^{3/2}_{e}}\\right]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that here the asymptotic bound again scales with the shot - noise - limited precision in terms of @xmath148 . in this case , the dominant term in this asymptotic limit is determined fully from the environment .",
    "as above , we can conclude that by squeezing the initial state of the environment it is possible to improve the performance of the second - order estimation scheme in the presence of the second - order phase - diffusion noise . by analogy the same result and",
    "conclusion holds for the linear estimation scheme affected by the linear phase - diffusion noise .",
    "naturally , squeezing the motional state of the interferometric mirror is probably not the most practical solution to the problem of phase diffusion .",
    "however , we believe that other metrological setups based , for example , on the optomechanical systems , could be better suited for these ideas .",

    "the presence of noise renders the heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology unachievable asymptotically .",
    "we confirm this by providing the ultimate precision bounds for the second - order estimation scheme affected by photon loss and phase diffusion . for a summary of all the main findings",
    "see table  [ summary ] .",
    "we observe that for both types of noise the gain in the phase sensitivity with respect to the linear estimation scheme is given by a multiplicative term @xmath0 , or @xmath154 in the general case of higher - order schemes .",
    "this result makes an intuitive sense as one can linearize the number operator @xmath7 around the mean , so that @xmath155 in the linear case , and @xmath156 in the nonlinear case which implies that the relevant gain in the phase sensitivity should scale as @xmath157 .",
    "regardless of the above similarities , the presence of phase diffusion can be considered more detrimental than the presence of photon loss .",
    "nevertheless , we find that under certain circumstances ( discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec::diffusion ]  b and  c ) , a careful engineering of the environment can , in principle , improve the performance of both linear and second - order estimation schemes affected by phase diffusion .",
