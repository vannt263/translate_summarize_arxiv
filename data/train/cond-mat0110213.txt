    "the transport of fluids in geological media plays a dominant role in different applications such as subsurface hydrology , hydrocarbon recovery and waste storage , and the transport properties of such media involves a combination of fluid flow at different length scales .",
    "first , there is transport at the microscopic level through the pore space of the rock itself .",
    "then , at macroscopic length scales , the flow through fractures is , in most cases , the dominant transport mechanism .",
    "finally , at even larger length scales , the dominant convective transport involves the flow through fracture networks .",
    "the first case has received considerable attention and is relatively well understood and , in fact , it can be placed within the framework of transport in porous media @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the flow through single fractures is clearly a prerequisite to the investigation or modeling of more complex cases such as the flow through macroscopic fracture networks .",
    "another key transport process present in geological systems , the transport of tracer particles carried by the fluid also requires an adequate understanding of the flow properties , in particular , the statistical properties of the velocity field .",
    "fractures have often been modeled as simple hele - shaw cells , with a cubic relation between the volumetric flow rate and the average aperture of the fracture , usually focusing most of the effort on investigating the flow through a macroscopic network of such fractures . however , although a typical fractured rock surface appears fairly smooth , aside from some random roughness , suggesting that poiseuille flow in a straight channel is the appropriate model of flow , laboratory experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite indicate that this classical view of a rock fracture as a straight channel is not adequate to describe the fluid flow even at low reynolds numbers .",
    "in fact , more careful analysis showed , in recent years , that geological fractures present highly spatially correlated , self - affine surfaces , with a roughness exponent @xmath0 surprisingly constant for different types of rocks whether naturally or artificially fractured @xcite . in view of these results , theoretical and numerical studies introduced the complex geometry of the fractures in order to calculate the transport properties of the system .",
    "however , the majority of these studies assumed that the reynolds ( lubrication ) approximation is valid so that the velocity field is given by a poiseuille flow everywhere , with a parabolic velocity profile across the aperture and in the direction of the mean flow @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that , for two - dimensional narrow - fractures , in which the roughness amplitude is large compared to the aperture , the reynolds approximation is no longer valid , and proposed a different approach in which the fracture is divided into approximately - straight segments with varying orientation angles .",
    "this approach allowed us to obtain the correction to the flow rate due to surface roughness as a function of the aperture and was validated by our numerical simulations .",
    "( a similar approach was used by oron and berkowitz to analyze the case of fractures with contacts between surfaces @xcite . ) in this work , we shall further investigate the case of narrow fractures , extending the results to three - dimensional fractures .",
    "we shall see that it is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the permeability of the fracture and for the velocity fluctuations , in the limit of narrow fractures , by means of the effective - medium approximation .",
    "we shall also investigate the dispersion of tracer particles advected by the flow field within the fracture and its dependence on the aperture .",
    "we shall first , in sec .",
    "[ self - affine ] , briefly discuss some basic definitions associated with self - affine surfaces and present our model of fractures as the gap between two perfectly matching self - affine surfaces . the lattice - boltzmann method , used to numerically simulate the fluid flow through the fractures is briefly presented in sec .",
    "[ lbm ] . then , in sec .  [ permeability ]",
    "we shall investigate the permeability by means of the effective - medium approximation and compare the results with our numerical results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ dispersion ] we investigate the dispersion of tracer particles convected by the flow field within the fracture and its dependence on the aperture of the fracture .",
    "following the work of mandelbrot @xcite , the application of the fractal model to describe surface topography has become widespread as it has been shown in several experiments that fracture surfaces , with various materials and fracturing methods , exhibit statistically self - affine scaling properties . particularly relevant to our work",
    "are the experiments performed with naturally fractured rocks @xcite .",
    "this self - affine description of fracture surfaces substantially improves the characterization of rough surfaces in terms of surface parameters such as the root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness , rms slope , and density of peaks , in that it provides the scaling behavior of these parameters , which are not intrinsic properties of the surface but strongly depend on the sample size @xcite .",
    "we shall briefly review here the mathematical characterization of self - affine surfaces , and its application to the case of fractured rocks .",
    "we consider a rock surface without overhangs , as it has been shown that , for natural rock surfaces , overhangs are not prevalent @xcite , whose height is given by a by a single - valued function @xmath1 , with the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 lying in the mean plane of the fracture .",
    "self - affine surfaces display scale invariance with different dilation ratios along different spatial directions , remaining unchanged under the rescaling @xcite @xmath4 here we consider disordered media , so these scaling laws apply only in an ensemble or spatial average sense .",
    "experiment indicates that for many materials isotropy can be assumed in the mean plane , implying that there is only one non - trivial exponent relating the dilation ratio in the mean plane to the scaling in the perpendicular direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is usually referred to as the roughness or hurst exponent @xcite .",
    "therefore , the surface height is a homogeneous function , of degree @xmath7 , on the mean plane coordinates , @xmath8    a surface with hurst exponent close to 1 has high spatial correlation and , as the hurst exponent decreases , heights of nearby points become more uncorrelated , becoming totally independent for @xmath7=0.5 . in most studies",
    "the roughness exponent is found to be close to @xmath9 , leading to the suggestion that it could be a universal value , independent of the material and of the fracture mode @xcite .",
    "the experimental values obtained with several different types of rocks , whether naturally or artificially fractured , are consistent with this suggestion , with @xmath7 lying around @xmath10 @xcite ( other values may arise from intergranular effects as in the case of sandstone rocks @xcite . ) therefore , as we shall investigate transport of fluids in fractured rocks , we will use a roughness exponent @xmath9 . furthermore , it is worth noting that the roughness exponent of a granitic fault surface at field length scales of several meters was found to be @xmath11 @xcite , thereby supporting the relevance of experimental results obtained at laboratory scales .",
    "in contrast with the case of self - similar surfaces , where the fractal dimension fully characterize them , the hurst exponent is not enough to describe a self - affine surface , and , in addition , the amplitude of the fluctuations in the height of the surface is to be specified .",
    "this amplitude of the fluctuations is usually expressed in terms of the characteristic length @xmath12 , which is the horizontal distance over which fluctuations in height have a rms slope of one . using the self - affine scaling law for the vertical fluctuations in surface height , @xmath13 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle \\propto r^{2\\zeta}\\ ] ] and the previously mentioned definition of the characteristic length @xmath12 , @xmath14 we",
    "can then obtain the variance of the fluctuations in surface height , over any length scale @xmath15 , in terms of the roughness exponent @xmath7 and the characteristic length @xmath12 , @xmath16 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle =   \\ell^2 \\left ( \\frac{r}{\\ell } \\right)^{2\\zeta}.\\ ] ]    in principle , the characteristic length @xmath12 can take any value , however , for fractured rocks it is usually found to be very small , and to lie either below the accessible range of length scales in the experiment ( @xmath17 m @xcite ) or below the self - affine range of the surface @xcite ; therefore , we shall not consider cases in which @xmath12 is within the simulated range of length scales .",
    "the self - affine surfaces are generated by a two - dimensional generalization of the fourier synthesis method previously used by us for the generation of self - affine curves @xcite .",
    "initially , an @xmath18 matrix , where each element will represent the height of the discrete version of the fracture surface , is generated with statistically independent , gaussian distributed , random numbers .",
    "then , the fourier transform of this initial random matrix is modulated by a power - law high - wave - numbers filter that introduces height - to - height correlations @xcite .",
    "that is , if @xmath19 is the fourier transform of the initial random matrix , then the fourier transform of the matrix representing the fracture surface heights is chosen to be , @xmath20 finally , the whole surface is rescaled in order to get the desired characteristic length @xmath12 . in this work",
    "we shall use @xmath9 and @xmath21 .",
    "this numerical method generates homogeneous and isotropic surfaces and is preferable instead of other numerical methods such as the random addition algorithm ( for a discussion of this point see ref .",
    "@xcite section v.a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ surface ] we show one of the numerically generated fracture surfaces .",
    "the surfaces generated with this method are periodic in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and , although the periodicity is not physically important it has some computational advantages when calculating the flow field using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we shall model fractures as the gap between a numerically generated self - affine surface and its replica , which is translated by a fixed distance @xmath22 in the direction normal to the mean plane of the surface .",
    "however , during the fracturing process of the rock , the opposite matching surfaces might experience a lateral shift , in addition to the vertical displacement .",
    "therefore , we shall also consider this situation by introducing a lateral shift to the upper surface either along the direction of the mean flow or perpendicular to it .",
    "in this work , we will analyze , for both types of fractures , with and without lateral shift , the case of _ narrow fractures _ ,",
    "in which the gap size @xmath22 is small compared to the vertical fluctuations of the fracture surface over length scales comparable to the size of the system @xmath23 . in view of eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) we obtain that fluctuations of the surface height over the whole system are given by @xmath24 and , then the limiting situation of narrow fractures corresponds to , @xmath25    in our simulations , and for systems size @xmath26 the largest gap size that fulfills the previous relation is @xmath27 .",
    "the lattice - boltzmann method ( lbm ) @xcite is particularly suitable to investigate the flow of fluids in a highly irregular geometries , and , specifically , to study the various features of transport in self - affine rough fractures which are sensitive to their complex geometrical structure . in this algorithm",
    ", fictitious particles move between neighboring sites on a lattice , with suitable collision rules , and the boundary of the flow domain is simply a surface of sites where the rule is modified in some way to keep the particles out .",
    "we use the face centered hypercubic ( fchc - projected ) version of the lbm , with a cubic lattice in 3 dimensions and 19 velocities ( d3q19 in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "the collision operator is approximated by a single relaxation time , the bhatnagar - gross - krook model @xcite , and the local equilibrium distribution given in @xcite is used .",
    "this pseudo - equilibrium distribution locally preserves mass and momentum values , and is formulated specifically to recover the navier - stokes equation at large length and time scales . for the no - slip solid boundaries , we use the simplest implementation of particle exclusion  the bounce - back rule , in which a particle incident on the boundary reverses its direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used for the inflow and outflow surfaces .",
    "a constant pressure gradient forcing the fluid is added in the @xmath2 direction , while the gap between surfaces extends over @xmath28 .    in what follows all quantities",
    "will be rendered dimensionless by the characteristic units of the numerical simulation .",
    "that is , taking the lattice - spacing as the unit length and the simulation time - step as the time unit .",
    "note that , since we are concerned with incompressible flows , we do not need to introduce a dimension of mass .",
    "the relaxation time is chosen so that the kinematic viscosity is @xmath29 in dimensionless units .",
    "the pressure gradient is @xmath30 , yielding a mean velocity in the range @xmath31 , for separation between surfaces of the fracture between @xmath32 .",
    "then , for gap sizes @xmath22 not larger than @xmath33 , the reynolds number is @xmath34 and the flow is governed by the stokes equations , which are invariant under a velocity rescaling .",
    "let us consider first the case in which the two matching surfaces of a fractured rock are separated by a distance @xmath22 in the normal direction , with no lateral shift between the two complimentary surfaces of the fracture .",
    "in this situation , the aperture of the fracture is clearly constant everywhere , but the effective local aperture for fluid flow , i.e. , the local width of the fracture channel normal to the mean flow direction strongly depends on the local angle between the surface and its mean plane .",
    "the following theoretical analysis will be based on a kind of local lubrication approximation , in which the fracture is divided into smaller rectangular blocks .",
    "the linear size @xmath35 of the blocks will be estimated as the length scale over which fluctuations in the surface height are small compared to the distance between surfaces and thus , each of these basic blocks can be considered , approximately , as two facing planes separated a distance @xmath22 and with varying orientation angles with respect to the mean plane of the fracture .",
    "the transport properties of these narrow fractures can be modeled using effective - medium ideas .",
    "the representation of the fracture in terms of quasi - linear blocks with random orientation can be mapped onto a regular two - dimensional square lattice , of lattice spacing @xmath35 , where the disorder only enters the distribution of hydraulic conductances lying on each of the lattice bonds . moreover , fluid flow is a locally conserved quantity at the lattice nodes and therefore , as we shall discuss in this section , this representation of the fracture is completely analogous to the classical random resistor networks that model electrical transport in disordered media @xcite .",
    "consider the two opposite ends @xmath36 and @xmath37 of a single quasi - linear block of a fracture , and its representation by a conductance joining the corresponding two lattice nodes @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , consider that a pressure drop is imposed between the two nodes , and that the lattice - bond joining @xmath36 and @xmath37 is oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the mean flow .",
    "using the poiseuille result for the flow through this segment of the fracture we have that @xmath38 ^ 3}{12 \\mu } \\frac{\\delta p_{ab}}{[\\xi / \\cos(\\theta)]}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the flow rate from node @xmath36 to node @xmath37 , @xmath35 is the linear size of the block , and @xmath40 is the orientation angle of the block , with respect to the mean plane of the fracture , in the direction of the imposed pressure drop @xmath41 . let us note , that a slightly different approximation to the transport of fluid in a single block can be made by modeling each block as a cylinder of diameter @xmath42 and length @xmath35 .",
    "however , these two approximations will only differ by a numerical factor , given that the ratio of the permeability of a cylinder to that of two parallel planes is independent of the separation between surfaces , @xmath43 .",
    "we can rewrite the previous equation in terms of the bond conductance @xmath44 as @xmath45 where @xmath44 is a random variable related to the actual height distribution of the fracture surface through the orientation angle @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , the fluid is incompressible and flux is conserved at each lattice node , @xmath46 where the sum is over all nodes @xmath36 connected directly to @xmath37 .",
    "the previous two equations are formally equivalent to the equations of an electrical - resistor network with the correspondence @xcite @xmath47    replacing eq .",
    "( [ block ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ kirchof ] ) we obtain the following system of linear equations for the pressure at each node of the network , @xmath48    then , the problem is now to solve the previous system of equations in the case where the hydrodynamic conductances @xmath44 vary according to some probability distribution , and we shall discuss now an approximation commonly used to solve this type of problems in the physics of disordered media , namely _ effective - medium theory_.      the effective - medium approximation ( ema ) is a standard method commonly used to calculate effective properties of a microscopically disordered medium , in which the random microscopic parameters are replaced by a certain mean value , chosen in a self - consistent way ( a detailed discussion of this approximation can be found eslewhere @xcite )",
    ".    we shall summarize here the main results obtained within ema for random - resistor networks but adapted to flow networks , using the correspondence given in ( [ analogy ] ) , and we shall make use of these results to compute the permeability of the fracture in sec .",

    "[ network ] ( the general case where @xmath28 can take any integer value is completely analogous and is discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "the idea then is to choose a mean ema hydraulic conductance @xmath50 , in a self - consistent way , such that it reproduces the average local field .",
    "that is , we require that the extra pressure differences induced when one individual conductance reverts from @xmath50 to its original value @xmath44 average to zero . in that case , when one bond conductance , oriented along the external pressure drop and surrounded by the effective medium , is replaced by an individual random conductance having the value @xmath44 , the uniform field solution , in which the pressure drops a constant amount @xmath51 across any bond conductance oriented along the imposed pressure difference , fails to satisfy fluid flux conservation .",
    "in fact , there will be an excess of fluid flux in that bond of @xmath52 this excess in fluid flux corresponds to an extra pressure drop @xmath53 , which can be calculated in terms of the conductance @xmath54 of the network between points @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the absence of @xmath44 .",

    "@xcite .      as discussed in the previous section , in order to determine the mean ema conductance @xmath50 , we first need to obtain the probability distribution of the individual bond conductances @xmath44 .",

    "guided by these results , the numerical procedure used to generate the fracture surfaces is intended to produce self - affine surfaces with gaussian fluctuations of the height , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ numericalsurfaces ] .",
    "moreover , the perturbative analysis we shall present shows that higher moments of the height distribution function are related to higher order corrections to @xmath50 and , therefore , the exact functional form of the distribution is not relevant but only its low - order moments .    finally , assuming that neighboring conductances are uncorrelated",

    "the case of three - dimensional fractures is somewhat different . for large separation between surfaces ( @xmath126 ; recall that @xmath127 ) a behavior similar to the unshifted case is again expected , since the change in the geometry of the fracture is asymptotically negligible , and therefore , the scaling relation given by eq .",

    "moreover , in contrast with the two - dimensional case , these velocity fluctuations are present even after the local velocity is averaged over the gap of the fracture .",

    "@xcite the analysis is based on the lubrication or reynolds approximation , where a poiseuille flow , with a parabolic velocity profile across the aperture , is assumed to be locally valid everywhere in the fracture . in this case , there are no fluctuations in the local velocity in the absence of fluctuations in the local aperture of the fractures , which is in fact the case when there is no lateral shift between surfaces . on the other hand , we consider the case of narrow fractures and the lubrication approximation is not valid ( at least in its simplest version ) .",
    "in fact , in our framework , geometric dispersion effects are present even in the absence of any lateral shift between surfaces , due to variations in the effective aperture that induce spatial fluctuations in the velocity field .",

    "the molecular and taylor contributions to the dispersion of tracer particles were discussed in our previous work , in the two - dimensional case , and they are not expected to be very sensitive to the fluctuations in the gap - averaged flow velocity , in that the molecular diffusion is clearly independent of the velocity field and the taylor dispersion is dominated by the gradients in velocity in the direction perpendicular to the fracture surface @xcite . then , if we only account for the geometric contribution to the dispersion of tracer particles the problem can be immensely simplified .",
    "in fact , instead of working with the three - dimensional velocity field we can use the two - dimensional gap - averaged velocity field @xmath153 .",
    "the range in which the geometric dispersion is the dominant mechanism contributing to the dispersion of tracer particles corresponds to intermediate pclet numbers ( intermediate velocities ) , and the presence of such a range of pclet numbers in self - affine fractures will be discussed in detail at the end of this section ( see sec .",

    "furthermore , in sec .  [ fluctuations ] we showed that the velocity field is approximately one dimensional , i.e. lateral fluctuations are small compared to the mean velocity ( @xmath156 ) .",

    "transport properties of three - dimensional self - affine rough fractures were investigated by means of the effective - medium approximation and numerical simulations using the lattice - boltzmann method .",
    "the numerical simulations verified the scaling behavior predicted by the effective - medium approach and , furthermore , allowed us to compute important transport parameters of the fractures , such as the dispersion length , and their dependence on the size of the aperture .",
    "two different cases were investigated , the unshifted case , in which the two matching surfaces of the fracture are displaced in the direction normal to the mean plane , and the shifted one , in which the upper surface is laterally displaced either in the direction of the flow or perpendicular to it .",
    "first , we modeled the fractures by a regular two - dimensional square - lattice of bond conductances , and the lattice spacing and the distribution of bond conductivities were related to the geometrical properties of the fracture . specifically , we related the lattice - spacing to the length scale over which fluctuations in the surface height are small compared to the aperture of the fracture , and it was determined in terms of the roughness exponent , the characteristic length and the aperture of the fractures .",
    "then , adapting some well - known results obtained by means of the effective - medium approximation in the analogous random - resistor network , we obtained the permeability of the fracture and its dependence on the aperture size in the limit of _ narrow fractures_. we showed that the permeability is , up to second order in a perturbative parameter , the same as in two - dimensional fractures .",
    "this quasi two - dimensional behavior of the transport of fluids through self - affine fractures was confirmed by the numerical computations of the streamlines , which presented very small lateral fluctuations .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed in the experimental work reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in that the structure developed by the invasion front of tracer particles presents very small fluctuations perpendicular to the mean flow in the unshifted case ( see fig .",
    "4a in ref .",
    ". moreover , the scaling behavior of the permeability with the aperture size was verified by our numerical results and , in addition to that , we showed that it is in agreement with numerical results performed in two - dimensional fractures .",
    "however , we also discussed an important difference between the 3d and 2d with cases , namely , the presence of fluctuations in the gap - averaged fluid velocity in three - dimensional fractures , and we were further able to predict the scaling behavior of the velocity fluctuations in the direction of the mean flow by means of the effective - medium approximation .",
    "the numerical simulations were in agreement with this result and , furthermore , showed that the velocity fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the flow have the same scaling but are approximately three times smaller in magnitude .",
    "similar results were obtained in the continuum approach to transport in heterogeneous porous media @xcite . finally , we investigated the case of shifted surfaces and showed that the permeability of the fractures strongly depends on the orientation of the shift , which is either in the direction of the imposed pressure drop or perpendicular to it , in the limit of _ narrow fractures_. furthermore , by means of numerical simulations we showed that the flow rate per unit width in three - dimensional fractures is bounded by the two - dimensional results .",
    "specifically , for a relative shift in the direction perpendicular to the mean flow the permeability is slightly affected and lies above the permeability of two - dimensional fractures . on the other hand , when the upper surface is shifted in the direction of the flow the permeability is largely reduced , but not as much as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that in three - dimensional fractures , in contrast with the two - dimensional case , the fluid can avoid low - permeability regions by flowing around them .",
    "we also presented a simplified representation of a local region of the fracture that , although naive in character , captures the effect of the orientation of the shift on the permeability of the fracture .",
    "the same effect is observed in experiments , in that the flow rate is larger in the direction perpendicular to the relative shift between surfaces ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "in the second part of this work , we investigated the dispersion of tracer particles in self - affine fractures .",
    "specifically , we analyzed the dependence of the geometric contribution to the dispersion process on the aperture size .",
    "first , we simplified the analysis by mapping the problem to the dispersion of tracer particles in the two - dimensional gap - averaged velocity field .",
    "we then distinguised between the two contributions to the dispersion coefficient , namely the relative magnitude of the velocity fluctuations and their correlation length .",
    "we observed that , in agreement with previous studies @xcite , the autocorrelation function of the velocity fluctuations decays faster in the direction perpendicular to the mean flow .",
    "finally , we showed that , even though the correlation length increases with the size of the aperture , the dispersion coefficient is asymptotically small in the limit of wide fractures .",
    "the latter effect is also observed in the experiments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were it was shown that the invasion front of tracer particles becomes increasingly smooth as the aperture of the fracture is increased .    finally , we investigated the dispersion of tracer particles in the fully three - dimensional velocity field inside the fractures . specifically , we discussed the range of pclet numbers in which the geometric contribution to dispersion is expected to be dominant and we showed that , depending on the geometric properties of the fracture , there might be no such a range of pclet numbers .",
    "however , we found that the geometric dispersion is dominant in the limit of _ narrow fractures _",
    ", and in general is dominant for large relative fluctuations of the velocity field and correlation lengths larger than the aperture of the fractures .",
    "we also investigated the transit time distribution of tracer particles , and their dependence on the mean transit time .",
    "we showed that , as the mean transit time is reduced and it becomes comparable or smaller than the correlation time of the tracer velocity , the transit time distribution becomes increasingly non - gaussian , developing long - time tails due to the presence of low - velocity zones where the only mechanism for tracer transport is molecular diffusion . in general , the transit time distributions are very similar to the case of tracer dispersion in a hele - shaw cell , except for the case of two - dimensional fractures shifted in the direction of the flow , which present the largest tails probably due to an enhancement of the low - velocity zones by the relative shift between surfaces .",
    "in fact , in agreement with the latter results , the two - dimensional fractures , with the upper surface shifted in the direction of the flow , were shown to have the lowest permeability .",
