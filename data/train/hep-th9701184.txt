    "a very important goal of a non perturbative approach to an asymptotically free theory such as the lattice is the determination of @xmath4 in a physical mass unit ; this requires a very precise measurement of the running coupling @xmath5 for very large @xmath6 . in order to perform the measure by a monte carlo simulation on a lattice",
    "it is useful to work in the framework of a new renormalization scheme , with its own renormalized coupling constant expandable in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "this can be done defining a renormalized coupling constant in terms of rectangular wilson loops .",
    "it is possible then to use finite size scaling techniques to reach very small distances without very large lattices @xcite .    in this work",
    "i want to test this program in the framework of an abelian gauge theory in two dimensions : the @xmath0 model .",
    "the choice of this specific model is justified by the fact that it is a renormalizable gauge theory and , above all , it shows both the asymptotic freedom and a confining potential between a particle - antiparticle pair , just as qcd does .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is simpler than qcd , being an _ abelian _ gauge theory in _ two _ dimensions and having the possibility of an expansion in powers of @xmath1 , that can be efficiently used to test the new renormalization scheme and the new approach to the problem of computing @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ cpn ] i introduce the @xmath0 model both in the continuum and on the lattice . in section [ fsscl ]",
    "i apply the fss technique to the study of the correlation length , trying to measure the @xmath7-parameter in two different renormalization schemes . in section [ rccpt ]",
    "i adopt the definition of the running coupling given in @xcite , whose perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath8 is obtained . in section [ polyrat ]",
    "i give some analytical and numerical results for the new coupling constant , obtained by means of the polyakov and creutz ratio . in section [ conc ]",
    "i conclude with some considerations about the strategy outlined in the present work and i try to single out the ulterior difficulties that come out when one wants to apply the same technique to the study of the creutz ratio .",
    "the @xmath9 model is a generalization of the non linear @xmath10-models .",
    "the bare lagrangian of the continuum theory is :    @xmath11 = \\frac n{2f}\\overline{d_\\mu z\\left ( x\\right ) } d^\\mu z\\left ( x\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is a complex @xmath13-vector constrained by the condition @xmath14 and the operator @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 local gauge invariance . ] .",
    "as it is suggested by the mass dimension of the coupling constant @xmath17 , the theory is renormalizable and it shows dimensional trasmutation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the theory is expandable in powers of @xmath1 ; in this framework it is possible to show that the massless particles of the ` standard ' perturbation theory acquire mass at the leading order in @xmath1 and they interact by a linear confining potential @xcite .",
    "a very good reference for the theory of spin models on the lattice is @xcite , where we find a convenient lattice action of the @xmath0 model , the gap equation , the inverse propagators @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the effective fields and the definition of a correlation length @xmath20 that i report here : @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the two - point correlation function of gauge invariant operator and @xmath23 is its fourier transform .",

    "a complete theory of the finite size scaling is contained in @xcite , while an explanation of the strategy used in what follows and the definition of the various fss functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the fss says that : @xmath33 or equivalently @xmath34 i have used the expressions reported in @xcite in the framework of the @xmath1 expansion , instead of a standard monte carlo simulations , in order to evaluate numerically the correlation length .",
    "the numerical computations have been performed by means of a fortran code , choosing lattices of sizes varying from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the results of these computations are showed on the figure [ csibetafig ] .    from these data",

    "an equivalent way to test the asymptotic scaling is to define an effective @xmath7-parameter is exactly known from @xcite ] : @xmath41 and to plot the function @xmath42 versus @xmath31 , as showed in the figure [ test ] .",
    "the deviation from the asymptotic behaviour ( [ alambdalat ] ) is less than @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "i have computed the function @xmath46 , according to the scheme outlined in @xcite and the figure [ sigmafig ] shows that it has these two asymptotic behaviours : @xmath47 that reflect these simple physical considerations :    1 .   in the limit",
    "@xmath48 the actual size @xmath49 of the box is not very important because the correlation length @xmath50 of the interaction is very small , compared to l ; we are very close to the infinite volume limit .",
    "2 .   in the limit @xmath51 , on the contrary",
    ", the correlation length @xmath50 is much larger than @xmath49 , that becomes the actual scale of the interaction : the observables are very sensible to what happens on the border of the box ; that is , @xmath50 , having the same dimension as @xmath49 , is directly proportional to it .",
    "if the fss is correct , the function ( [ sigmacsi ] ) should depend only on the ratio @xmath52 , and not on @xmath20 and @xmath49 separately .",
    "i can check if this is the case by verifying that the several curves obtained on the different pairs of lattices approximately superimpose .",

    "the biggest relative violation of the fss is about @xmath53 for @xmath54      now , in order to go on with the program outlined in @xcite , i need to know the function @xmath56 in every point of a sufficiently large interval ; i have two possibilities :    1 .",

    "there are several systematic effects intrinsic in both procedures ; i have made some checks in order to choose the values of the parameters that minimize them .",
    "anyway , all ` spurious ' systematic errors can be made smaller than the fss violation , which in turn constitutes the real physical limit of our procedures .",
    "the figure [ effefig ] shows the results of the calculation .",
    "a perturbative calculation on a finite lattice , along the line sketched in @xcite gives the following result for the fss function @xmath64 : @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the large @xmath13 limit : @xmath68 and @xmath69 i checked the range of validity of this perturbative result and i found good agreement for all @xmath70 .",
    "we can do this perturbative test on the function @xmath63 directly .",
    "if we look at the shape of the function @xmath10@xmath71 we realize that the number of points in which it is necessary to know @xmath62 itself in order to reconstruct @xmath72 is a decreasing function of @xmath73 ; this implies that a systematic error on the numerical computation of @xmath10@xmath71 will propagate more and more when @xmath73 becomes smaller and smaller .",

    "the formula ( [ fr ] ) can be used to compute numerically the reference continuum quantity to be compared with the lattice results ; it can also be expanded in the regime @xmath132 ( perturbative or scaling region ) obtaining the scaling behaviour of the interaction force : @xmath133 this result can be rewritten with the same precision as @xmath134 it is possible to extract from ( [ scalingforce ] ) the running coupling constant in the scheme outlined in the previous paragraph in the limit @xmath135 @xmath136 this expression is in perfect agreement with the prediction of the 1-loop perturbative renormalization group @xmath137 if the @xmath7-parameter is chosen consistently with the renormalization scheme introduced before ) ] : @xmath138    the difference between the exact continuum curve and the asymptotic one is below @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "one could then measure the interaction force on a finite lattice by means of the so - called polyakov ratio , for several values of @xmath141 , keeping @xmath142 fixed , and then fit the values with equation ( [ pertforce ] ) in order to extract the @xmath7-parameter .",
    "it is so possible to understand how fast the measures on the lattice approach the continuum limit ( [ lambda ] ) when the lattice spacing goes to 0 .",
    "the polyakov ratio on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions is given by @xmath143 in the leading order in the @xmath1 expansion , where @xmath144 is the lattice propagator of the gauge field @xmath145 reported in @xcite .",

    "the study of the correlation length has clarified how to use the fss technique to estrapolate the finite volume measures to infinite volume results . in this framework",
    "it could be interesting to apply the same technique to a basic observable : the creutz ratio derived from rectangular wilson loops . even if this seems to be just a mere step - by - step execution of the program already outlined in @xcite for the correlation length ,",
    "there are some points that should be underlined :    1 .",
    "the presence of the additional scale @xmath151 implies that the fss function depends on two variables , instead of only one .",
    "a systematic effect @xmath152 ( analogous to that found in the case of the polyakov ratio ) is present in the wilson loop case , too .",
    "3 .   in the special case of an abelian lattice gauge theory defined on a torus , as our version of the lattice @xmath0 model is ,",
    "there are some kinematical effects that have to be considered in order to obtain significant results @xcite .",
    "the special shape of the fss function @xmath153 imposes another limitation on the region where the fss technique can be applied efficiently : let us define @xmath154 @xmath155 obeys to a fss law similar to ( [ fsslawcsi ] ) seen in the section [ fsscl ] for the correlation length : @xmath156 the counterpart of the function @xmath157 is @xmath158 where @xmath159 the limit @xmath160 means simply that we are in the scaling region .",
    "if the fss law ( [ 4.4 ] ) is valid and choosing @xmath161 , @xmath162 @xmath163 with @xmath164 once i have measured the function @xmath165 in a large enough region of the plane @xmath166 , i can try to reconstruct the function @xmath167 by : @xmath168 with @xmath169 + a severe limitation to this computational scheme is represented by the practical impossibility to reach very small values of @xmath170 . from figure [ sigmafig ] we see that @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "when we try to compute @xmath173 for a @xmath170 quite small , @xmath174 in ( [ 80 ] ) stays very close to @xmath175 even for @xmath176 very large ; now , for @xmath177 , while @xmath178 is reduced to a half at each step , @xmath142 stays about constant ( remember ( [ 4.5 ] ) ) .",
    "i can do two things , in order to lessen @xmath178 : i can lessen @xmath151 , and , once i have reached the lowest limit for @xmath151 , since @xmath179 is finite , i must increase @xmath50 , and this means that i have to increase @xmath49 too , to keep @xmath142 constant . in conclusion",
    ", if i want to compute the function @xmath180 for a very small @xmath142 i need to simulate on very large lattices , or , in other words , a upper limit on the size @xmath49 of the lattice implies a lower limit on @xmath142 , as far as the measure of @xmath180 concerns .",
    "these considerations leads to the conclusion that the application of the fss technique to the wilson loop needs a careful study of all the systematic effects .",
    "furthermore , the problem outlined in the last point above seems to limit the efficiency of the method in the region where also the traditional techniques fail . the crucial point is represented by the exact form of @xmath181 when @xmath51",
    "once i have fixed the largest dimension @xmath182 of a usable lattice , the lowest limit @xmath183 at which it is possible to compute the function @xmath184 is different from @xmath185 and it depends on the specific definition of the correlation length chosen .",
