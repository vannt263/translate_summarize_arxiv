    "historically , spiral galaxies have performed a critical role in the studies of the dark matter .",
    "observations of the outer flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have focused the attention to the then overlooked missing mass problem ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that stresses the fact that most of what we see ( light ) is just a fraction of what we would like to observe ( mass )",
    ". a critical further step , yet to be accomplished , is to understand the connection between ordinary and dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies to understand whether ( and possibly how ) light traces mass .    the kinematic decomposition of velocity fields of spiral galaxies is the general method to map their distribution of dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the stellar mass distribution is poorly constrained , and the under - determined stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) translates into degeneracies , such as the disk - halo and the cusp - core problems , that prevent unique decompositions . in this context ,",
    "high resolution , accurate rotation curves , such as the observed by the , are necessary to alleviate the problem @xcite .",
    "previous works have supported the scenario of cored dark matter profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but studies on the systematic errors and larger , homogeneous samples , are still needed to confirm these results .",
    "this series of papers on the survey has the goal of imposing tighter constraints on the study of dark matter distributions in spiral galaxies . in this paper , we build a new surface photometry data set for 128 galaxies in the r@xmath0-band , observed over the years at the , which provides the basis for the determination of stellar masse in forthcoming work .",
    "additionally , we complement this data with public data in order to obtain @xmath1 photometry for 108 galaxies as well as to increase the r@xmath0-band data to 170 galaxies ( @xmath7 of the survey ) .    besides the surface brightness profiles",
    ", we also compile a homogeneous photometric catalogue including several photometric quantities of general interest , such as magnitudes , sizes and isophotal properties .",
    "in addition , we perform a multi component light decomposition in order to separate the light from the disks ( our main interest to dynamical decomposition ) from other components such as bulges and bars .",
    "finally , we perform a first set of applications to our data set by determining important scaling relations with luminosity , size and velocity of galaxies , and by deriving the tully fisher relation in the r@xmath0-band .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample is briefly outlined in section [ sec : sample ] . following this ,",
    "the details of the observations , data reduction and calibration are shown in section [ sec : observations ] . in section [ sec : analysis ] we present the methods used for the determination of the surface brightness , pa , ellipticity and integrated magnitude profiles , and we detail the process of multi component decomposition . in section [ sec : tests ] , we test our results against other similar works , and we check the internal consistency of our results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : scaling ] we derive several scaling relations involving luminosity , size and rotation velocity using the decomposition results , with special emphasis on the r@xmath0-band tully - fisher relation .",
    "the ghasp sample consists of 203 spiral and irregular galaxies in the local universe for which high - resolution h@xmath2 maps have been observed with fabry - perot interferometry .",
    "the sample was initially designed to be a subsample of the westerbork survey ( whisp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the goal of providing a local universe reference for kinematics and dynamics of disk - like galaxies .",
    "the sample was designed to cover a large range of morphological types , including ordinary , mixed - type and barred galaxies , thus excluding only early - type galaxies because of their low h@xmath2 content , as illustrated in figure [ fig : morphs ] .",
    "the photometric sample presented here is built with data coming from two sources .",
    "photometric r@xmath0-band data was obtained by the ghasp collaboration at the over the last decade for 128 galaxies . to enlarge the sample ,",
    "we also take advantage of the public dataset from the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the @xcite , which provides imaging and calibration in five pass bands ( @xmath1 ) for 108 of our galaxies . by the combination of both data sets , we are able to obtain photometry of a total of 170 galaxies , which are listed in table [ tab : sample ] with details about the observation . however , we note that , on average , the data observed at ohp in the r@xmath0-band goes about half magnitude deeper than the sdss data .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : decomp ]          since early works of @xcite and @xcite , the intensity profile of disks have been mostly described by a simple exponential law ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the central ( @xmath10 ) intensity of the disk and @xmath11 is the disk scale length .",
    "usually , we refer to the central intensity in terms of surface brightness using the relation @xmath12 . for the case of exponential disks ,",
    "the total apparent magnitude is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the minor - to - major axis ratio of the galaxy .",
    "however , deviations from a simple exponential disk were already noticed by @xcite , specially in the form of truncations or breaks in the inner profiles of galaxies .",
    "later , also noticed breaks at large radii of disks , and more recently deviations at very low surface brightness have been observed , including upward bends ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    based on these observations , @xcite proposed a reviewed classification of disks in three categories : type i , simple disks well described by exponential disks ; type ii , disks with downward truncations ; and type iii , disks with upward bends . a local census of disk properties performed by of late - type galaxies ( sb - sm ) estimated the fraction of type i galaxies to be only 10% ,",
    "while 60% are classified as type ii and 30% are type iii according to this new classification scheme .",

    "[ tab : decomp ] , we include a classification of the disks according to our observations .",
    "however , it is important to notice that breaks may occur at different radial distances , with different physical interpretations : inner breaks ( @xmath21 mag arcsec@xmath22 ) may be related to star formation , while outer breaks ( @xmath23 mag arcsec@xmath22 ) may indicate a real drop in the stellar mass density @xcite . therefore , our classifications are restricted to the mean limiting surface brightness of 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath22 .",
    "apart from the disk , several other components are observed , including bulges , bars , arms , rings and lenses .",
    "we included those components in the decomposition using a srsic function @xcite , given by    @xmath24\\right ) , \\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the effective scale of the component ( for which 50% of the light is within @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is the intensity at the effective radius , and @xmath27 is the srsic index .",
    "the term @xmath28 is not a free parameter , but a function of the s ' ersic index due to the parametrization of the function at the effective radius instead of at the centre . in our calculations , we adopted the expressions for @xmath28 presented in the appendix [ a1 ] of @xcite . in a first order approximation , @xmath29 , although the error may be considerable for @xmath30 . for simplification",
    ", we also rescale the effective intensity to surface brightness using the expression @xmath31 . in the case of equation ,",
    "the total magnitude is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the complete gamma function of a variable @xmath34 .",
    "the srsic profile is a generalization of other commonly used profile functions , such as the exponential for @xmath35 , a gaussian for @xmath36 and a @xcite s profile @xcite for @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the srsic index can also be used as an indicator of the kind of component that is being observed . for example , in the optical and near - infrared wavelengths , @xcite have shown that @xmath38 may indicate a pseudobulge , whereas @xmath39 may indicate a classic bulge for the spheroidal components .",
    "besides , bars have typically @xmath40 @xcite . in the table [",
    "tab : decomp ] , where the decomposition results are presented , we include a classification of the srsic function components according to the visual inspection of images and profiles , such as bulges , bars , lenses and spiral arms .    in 35 galaxies ,",
    "a nuclear source is also detected , which may be related to different physical processes , such as an active nucleus or a stellar concentration .",
    "we have tested two approaches for parametrizing these components , using either a srsic component or a single delta function with a peak at @xmath10 . in 12 cases ,",
    "the former approach resulted in a better description of the nucleus , because they have slightly larger fwhm than that of the modelled psf and/or because of the different shape of the nuclear source compared to a star .",
    "these components are described as nucleus in tables [ tab : decomp ] in the column 5 . for 23 galaxies , however , the later approach of using a delta function resulted in a better description of the nucleus in these cases .",
    "this delta function has only one free parameter , the magnitude of the source ( @xmath41 ) , and its profile is of a field star which is described as a moffat function .",
    "these point source magnitudes are included in the last row of table [ tab : decomp ] .",
    "in this section we make a series of tests on our photometric results to verify their consistency and to compare them with similar results in the literature .",
    "we have already made an internal consistency check of our sb profiles in figure [ fig : ugriztor ] , where we observed that the sb profiles from data are similar to those observed with direct measurements in the r@xmath0-band .",
    "our sb profiles can also be compared with those derived for twelve galaxies in common with in the r@xmath0-band , as shown in figure [ fig : compdejong ] , where black and red lines show the difference between our and the literature data for the and data sets respectively . to make a proper comparison ,",
    "we have fixed the position angle and the ellipticity of the galaxies to mimic the method of those authors instead of using free position angle and ellipticity as in section [ sec : profiles ] .",
    "we also limited the comparison to regions greater than the seeing of our images .",
    "the most deviant case is ugc 4256 , but the internal consistency of our results for two different data sets indicates a possible systematic offset in the data of for this galaxy .",
    "the deviation in the outer region of ugc 508 can be explained by the limited field of view in the images of which cuts part of the galaxy . in this case , it is also possible to see a large variation of the isophotes fainter than 21 mag arcsec@xmath42 within the observations of .",
    "finally , the problematic case of ugc 10445 for the data can be explained by the relatively short exposure time for this object , including only one image , which affects the accuracy of the sky subtraction .",
    "apart from these remarks , the overall picture is a good agreement with , which is in turn in agreement with several other authors in the literature .        in figure",

    "we also display the mean residual difference ( @xmath44 ) and its standard deviation ( @xmath45 ) for each parameter , resulting in compatible measurements in both data sets within one standard deviation .        in figure",

    "we compare these luminosities with the physical sizes of each component , using the scale length of disks ( @xmath11 ) , or the inner disk length in the cases of broken disks , the effective radius of the bulge ( @xmath25 ) and the effective radius of the galaxy ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to correct the sizes of the components for extinction , and we only rescale the sizes according to the distance .",
    "finally , we use the velocity @xmath65 as in @xcite as our dynamical tracer , excluding galaxies for which the flat part of the rotation curve was not reached in the velocity field analysis of the h@xmath2 observations .",
    "we assessed the statistical significance of pairs of luminosities , sizes and velocities using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath67 , which is a measurement of the strength of the correlation of two variables , and the associated p - value @xmath68 , which indicates the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one obtained from a random distribution , both indicated in the boxes at the top of each panel . for 18 cases , we obtained correlations with @xmath69% , for which we calculated scaling laws considering the direct and inverse cases .",
    "the relations , displayed in the form of dashed lines in figure [ fig : corr ] , were calculated as in the following .",

    "the presence of the variables in both the numerator and in the denominator of relation makes the equation non - linear , and most common methods of minimization , such as the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite , may have problems to obtain convergence . to obtain stable solutions , we used the interactive method described by @xcite , which consists in solving equation for a fixed value of @xmath73 , and then update @xmath73 by multiplying for @xmath79 elevated to a power of @xmath80 , until obtaining @xmath81 .",

    "out of the 21 pairs of parameters , we observe that only three combinations have relatively low correlation coefficients .",
    "this indicates that most of the spiral galaxy properties are somehow linked .",
    "although there are many possible properties that shape galaxies , such as different mass , angular momentum , and despite secular evolution effects , such as those which may form bars , there is still a great similarity among spirals which is still to be explained .",
    "also , this large number of correlations restrict the interpretation of the correlations individually , and certainly a comprehensible interpretation will be possible only with a more complete model of galaxy evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we are going to briefly discuss a few of the scaling laws that have been observed here and previously in the literature , with the exception of the tully - fisher relation , which we address with greater detail in [ sec : tf ] .",
    "the relation ( q ) between the sizes of bulges and disks was obtained previously by other authors and may have important clues for galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "@xcite argue that disks should have been formed earlier than bulges and , therefore , the properties of the bulges are linked to their host disks . due to the relatively low srsic indices of the bulges ,",
    "these are indeed likely to be pseudobulges @xcite , which are formed by secular evolution of the disks and , therefore , correlations among these parameters naturally arise in a scenario of secular evolution , disfavoring scenarios of decoupled size relation such as bulges formed by mergers . we have found that the median value of @xmath193 is 0.14 considering all galaxies , which is in agreement to the values in the literature ( for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity of bulge is also of importance to understand its origin .",
    "bulge luminosities and sizes are expected to correlate , as already indicated in equation , @xmath194 , and indeed there is a strong correlation as shown in equation ( l ) . moreover",
    ", the bulge luminosity is correlated to all other measured properties of the disks , to the whole galaxy and also to the rotation velocity .",
    "therefore , the properties of the bulges we observe in late - type galaxies of the local universe are probably the result of secular evolution .",
    "interestingly , the bulge luminosity is also correlated with the supermassive black hole masses , illustrating the important role of the bulges to understand the processes of galaxy formation yet to be fully understood .",
    "another parameter that correlates strongly with almost all the others is the luminosity of the galaxy , as shown in equations ( a ) , ( b ) , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( j ) .",
    "the importance of the total luminosity , also observed by @xcite , may indicate that the baryonic portion of the galaxy has a pivotal role in the appearance of galaxies : it is connected with the gravitational potential through the velocity , but has a more direct link with the size ( or shape ) of the galaxy .",
    "other photometric relations well documented in the literature include the relation ( k ) between bulge and disk luminosities @xcite , and ( f ) which relates bulge and total luminosities @xcite .",
    "the rotation velocity of the galaxies is usually studied in comparison with integrated photometry , such as given in relation ( b ) , the tully - fisher relation , and the size - velocity relation ( m ) also studied by @xcite . however , here we show that the rotation velocity also strongly correlate with the luminosity and size of the disk component , as shown in relations ( c ) and ( n ) , which is expected because the disk is responsible for the majority of the light of the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , however , the luminosity of the bulge also correlates with the rotation velocity , as shown in relation ( h ) , indicating that the bulge properties have a dynamical link with the galaxy that hosts it .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is the most important scaling relation for disk galaxies , and it has been used for several purposes including distance determinations and , historically , as a way of measuring the hubble constant .",
    "the tf relation relates the maximum velocity of the rotation curve , @xmath65 with the total magnitude of the galaxies in the form of a power law .",
    "the tf relation has already been measured in the sample previously by @xcite in the near - infrared bands h and k , so here we add to those results the optical r@xmath0-band .",
    "we adopt the following parametrization    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is the absolute total magnitude in the passband @xmath197 , @xmath198 is the maximum velocity of the rotation curve , @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the slope and the zero point of the tf relation .",
    "both the slope and the zero point of the tully fisher relation are of importance because they may be used either as constraints or as tests for models of galaxy formation and evolution .    to produce a suitable sample for this specific relation , we select the galaxies according to the following criteria .",
    "we remove galaxies with inclinations greater than @xmath201@xmath202due to their high internal extinction , and also galaxies with inclinations smaller than @xmath203@xmath202because of their higher uncertainty in the determination of the rotation curve velocity .",
    "we also exclude galaxies with recession velocities lower than 3000 km s@xmath204 due to possible peculiar velocities affecting the hubble flow , except for the cases where more accurate distance indicators were used , such as cepheids and red - giant branch distances .",
    "finally , as we are only dealing with h@xmath2 velocity fields , we use the analysis of @xcite to exclude from the sample galaxies for which the maximum rotation velocity is not achieved according to their classification of the maps .",
    "we use our two absolute magnitude estimators , the asymptotic ( @xmath59 ) and the isophotal ( @xmath205 ) as the probe of the galaxy luminosity , resulting in samples with 80 and 72 galaxies respectively .",
    "most galaxies of sample are not part of clusters of galaxies , so we consider that our tf relation is basically probing the field environment , although the expected difference of the tf relation in different environments is mild @xcite .",
    "the tf relation in the r@xmath0-band is shown in figure [ fig : tullyfisherr ] . to calculate the regression coefficients ,",
    "we have used the @xmath72 minimization of equation as described in section [ subsec : corr ] . also , the so - called inverse tully - fisher relation @xcite coefficients are calculated as follows .",
    "we calculated the coefficients @xmath206 and @xmath207 by interchanging the variables @xmath208 in equation , and then calculated the inverse tf relation using the relations @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the summary of the results for the tf relation and the inverse tf relations is presented in table [ tab : tf ] .    lccc relation & @xmath211 & @xmath212 & @xmath73 +   + tf & @xmath213 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 + inverse tf & @xmath216 & @xmath217 & @xmath218 +   + tf &",
    "@xmath219 & @xmath220 & @xmath221 + inverse tf & @xmath222 & @xmath223 & @xmath224 +    the tf relation is not just an important tool for measuring distances of galaxies , but it is also crucial to highlight processes of galaxy evolution , for instance , by comparing the tf relation of different morphological types .",
    "spiral galaxies have a single tf relation , but lenticular and elliptical galaxies have tf relations which run approximately parallel when compared to spirals @xcite .",
    "we observe that the tf relation of spirals in the r@xmath0band is well defined for almost all galaxies , with only two exceptions that are worth discussing .",
    "ngc 12276 , marked in the figure [ fig : tullyfisherr ] with a yellow halo , does not seem to have any special feature to be offset from the tf relation , so one possibility to explain its position is that the distance to the galaxy is not accurate .",
    "we have used the value of 78.8 mpc from epinat et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for consistency with the previous works , which is the expected value according to the systematic velocity using the hubble flow .",
    "however , @xcite have estimated the distance to this galaxy of 40 mpc using the ring size , which implies in a difference of @xmath2251.5 magnitudes that is enough to bring the galaxy much closer to the tf relation .",
    "the galaxy with a red halo in figure [ fig : tullyfisherr ] , ngc 4256 , has a peculiar morphology of a single arm and an asymmetric rotation curve , which may be the cause to move the galaxy off the tf relation defined by relatively more relaxed spirals . in this case ,",
    "star formation may have been triggered recently as a response to a gravitational field , resulting in a relatively luminous object compared to the tf relation .",
    "the slope and the zero point of the r@xmath0-band tf relation in our work are in agreement with those previously derived the literature .",
    "@xcite , for instance , determined the slope and zero point for a sample of 115 galaxies in four nearby clusters with velocities derived from hi line widths , and by not considering errors in both variables nor the intrinsic scatter of the relation , they have found @xmath226 and @xmath227 , which is consistent with our results within 2 sigmas . on the other hand , @xcite has derived the tf relation for the ursa major cluster using the inverse relation without intrinsic scatter , and fixing the uncertainties in 0.05 mag for the magnitudes and 5% in the velocities . in this framework , they found slopes ranging from -7.1 to -9 , and zero points ranging from -3.15 to 2.81 for their various samples , which is similar to our inverse tf relation parameters .    the tf relation in the infrared pass bands is important because these wavelengths are reliable tracers of the stellar masses . @xcite",
    "have used the sample to derive the tf relation in the h and k bands using 2mass survey data @xcite as well as stellar and baryonic tf relations , and using a method similar to ours , they have obtained slopes of @xmath228 and @xmath229 and zero points of @xmath230 and @xmath231 for the h and k bands respectively . as expected , the r@xmath0-band slope is greater than the slope in the near - infrared band ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , one important feature observed in the infrared is a break in the tf relation for galaxies with @xmath232 , in the sense that galaxies below this velocity are under luminous related to the expected tf relation for bright galaxies .",
    "this break in the tf relation is not noticed in the r@xmath0-band .",
    "this difference in the shapes of the near - infrared and optical tf at the low - mass regime can be understood if one inspects the bottom panels of figure [ fig : tullyfisherr ] , which show the optical to near - infrared colours of the galaxies as a function of the maximum rotation velocities .",
    "these panels show a flat colour distribution except for the galaxies with @xmath233 km s@xmath234 , indicating different mass - to - light ratios these galaxies .",
    "these low mass systems are bluer than more massive galaxies , indicating younger objects that may have been forming stars recently , and this effect fortuitously compensates for the difference in the stellar mass to light ratios , causing the differences in the shapes of the near - infrared and optical tfs at low masses .",
    "this study provided photometrically calibrated surface brightness profiles of galaxies , with 170 profiles in the r@xmath0-band and 108 in the bands u , g , r , i and z. from these data , we derived r@xmath0-band integrated photometric parameters , presented in table [ table : photr ] , which are consistent with other works in the literature .",
    "all these results are public and will be available in digital format at the fabry perot repository in http://cesam.lam.fr/fabryperot .    we perform multi component structural decompositions in the r@xmath0-band , presented in table [ tab : decomp ] , with the goal of separating the disk component from bulges , bars , lenses and nuclear sources , as a preparation to our forthcoming paper on the kinematic decomposition of velocity fields , which will be compared with the photometric work .    finally , we have applied new photometric data to observe bulges , disks and global scaling relations among luminosities , sizes and velocities in the r@xmath0-band .",
    "we derived expressions for 18 scaling relations , which may be used to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , we studied the tully fisher relation using velocities derived solely from h@xmath2 maps from .",
    "we have obtained slopes and zero points that are consistent with previous findings in the literature in the r@xmath0-band for cluster galaxies , reinforcing the idea that the tully fisher relation is basically a relation between the total stellar content and the gravitational potential , which is barely affected by the environment and the presence of photometric substructures .",
