    "the @xmath0-process accounts for the origin of about a half of the abundances of elements heavier than iron .",
    "the other half mostly come from the @xmath7-process .",
    "nevertheless , the astrophysical site for the @xmath0-process has not yet been unambiguously identified . among the large number of proposed candidates ,",
    "the neutrino - heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star ( hereafter `` neutrino - driven wind '' ) has been suggested ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as perhaps the most promising site .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the solar @xmath0-process abundances were well reproduced as material was ablated from the proto - neutron star in neutrino - driven winds .",
    "there are , however , a few serious problems in their numerical results .",
    "first , elements with @xmath8 were significantly overproduced by over a factor of 100 .",
    "second , the requisite high entropy ( @xmath9 ) in their supernova simulations has not been duplicated by other independent theoretical studies ( witti , janka , & takahashi 1994 ; takahashi , witti , & janka 1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ) . on the other hand , other viable sites",
    "have been demonstrated to also naturally reproduce the solar @xmath0-process abundance pattern .",
    "for example , it has been shown that neutron - star mergers can naturally reproduce the abundances of nuclei with @xmath10 ( freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann 1999 ) .",
    "collapsing o - ne - mg cores resulting from progenitor stars of @xmath11 has also been suggested ( wheeler , cowan , & hillebrandt 1998 ) to be a promising site for the @xmath0-process .",
    "in contrast to the above difficulties in the theoretical studies of the neutrino - driven wind scenario , observational data seem to confirm that type  ii supernovae are indeed the site for the production of @xmath0-process elements .",
    "for example , spectroscopic studies of metal - poor halo stars indicate very early enrichment of @xmath0-process elements consistent with production in massive stars ( sneden et al .",

    "have furthermore demonstrated that the large dispersion of the @xmath0-process element europium in metal - poor halo stars is also reproduced if the @xmath0-process originates from type  ii supernovae ( see also tsujimoto , shigeyama , & yoshii 2000 ; qian 2000 ) .",
    "as one way to fix the schematic wind models , it has been suggested that general relativistic effects increase the entropy and reduce the dynamical timescale of neutrino - driven wind models . using semi - analytic studies for spherically symmetric ,",
    "steady flow of neutrino - heated ejecta , qian & woosley ( 1996 ) showed that the inclusion of a first post - newtonian correction to the gravitational force equation increased the entropy by @xmath12 and reduced the timescale by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "cardall & fuller ( 1997 ) further developed this argument by considering a fully general relativistic treatment .",
    "they considered a wide range of neutron - star compaction ratios ( ratio of the gravitational mass to the neutron star radius in schwarzschild coordinates ) .",

    "the redshift of neutrino energies and bending of the neutrino trajectories by general relativity are explicitly taken into account .",

    "i , @xmath22 for each neutrino - driven wind was fixed such that the temperature at @xmath33  km was 0.1  mev .",
    "however in that case no physical solution exists for @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath4 , because the temperature does not cool to 0.1  mev before the wind reaches @xmath33  km for any physical solutions .",
    "note that equations  ( 1)-(3 ) have no physical solution for @xmath35 . in order to avoid this discontinuity ,",

    "note that the case of a smaller compaction ratio @xmath45 is omitted in this study , where @xmath0-processing may not be possible ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  1 shows : a ) the mass ejection rate @xmath38 ; b ) the entropy per baryon @xmath46 at @xmath47  mev ; and c ) the dynamical timescale @xmath48 measured as the time for material to cool from @xmath49  mev to 0.2  mev , as a function of @xmath30 for supersonic winds . the mass ejection rate is the maximum value for physical solutions of the winds . the dot - dashed , dashed , and thick - solid lines respectively denote models a , b , and c. as can be seen in figure  1 , for larger @xmath30 , @xmath38 and @xmath50 take larger and smaller values , respectively .",
    "a similar trend in entropy can be seen in @xmath48",
    ". however , the time scale saturates at @xmath51 a few times @xmath37  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "this can be traced to the smaller transonic radii @xmath52 and higher initial temperature for higher neutrino luminosities .",
    "the temperature gradient is steeper when @xmath0 is closer to the neutron star surface , while being approximately constant for @xmath53 ( paper  i ) .",
    "thus , the temperature decreases more slowly for @xmath54 than for @xmath55 .",
    "for higher luminosity cases @xmath56  ergs  s@xmath4 , the winds pass @xmath52 with @xmath57  mev . as a result ,",
    "the dynamical timescale does not decrease for higher luminosities .",
    "the @xmath0-process favors higher entropy and shorter dynamical timescale .",
    "thus , a robust @xmath0-process is difficult to obtain once the neutrino luminosity is higher than a few times @xmath37  ergs  s@xmath4 . comparing the results of models  a and b ( or models  a and c )",
    ", we find that more `` compact '' proto - neutron stars eject less material , and obtain significantly higher entropies and shorter dynamical timescales .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of cardall & fuller ( 1997 ) .",
    "clearly , the more `` compact '' neutron star models ( b and c ) will obtain more favorable physical conditions for the @xmath0-process .    on the other hand , comparing the results of models  b and c which are at the same compaction ratio",
    ", we see that a more massive ( or smaller radius ) proto - neutron star ejects slightly less material and provides higher entropy , but involves a larger dynamical timescale .",
    "these can be explained by the relations @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for fixed energy and neutrino luminosity ( @xcite ) in the newtonian limit .",
    "based on these results alone it is difficult to judge which of the models  b or c is more favorable for the @xmath0-process .",
    "differences of the nucleosynthesis results between these models are to be discussed in the next section .",
    "figure  1 also shows the results of the numerical simulation of the winds from sumiyoshi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for @xmath40 @xmath41   km ) and @xmath61   km ) , respectively .",
    "these are denoted by filled squares and circles .",
    "open squares and circles show the results of qian & woosley ( 1996 ) calculated with post - newtonian corrections for the same parameter sets of @xmath40 .",
    "our results for @xmath22 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 are in good agreement with theirs . ultimately , mass ejection rates must be determined by a detailed hydrodynamic simulation of a proto - neutron star with neutrino transport being taken into consideration",
    "nevertheless , our mass ejection rates , entropies , and dynamical timescales are in good agreement with those of sumiyoshi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who calculated steady - flow neutrino - driven winds with the use of a one - dimensional hydrodynamic code including neutrino heating and cooling processes .",
    "thus , we conclude that the true mass ejection rates are probably close to the supersonic winds obtained here .    without imposing an outer boundary ,",
    "however , the temperature and density diminish too quickly in the supersonic winds .",
    "this is not favorable for the @xmath0-process .",
    "therefore , a slightly smaller mass ejection rate , @xmath62 , is adopted for application to @xmath0-process calculations in the next section .",
    "the advantage of this reduction is that the temperature and density fall off slowly during the @xmath0-process ( @xmath63 ) in these subsonic winds , ensuring enough time for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements to proceed .",
    "this situation resembles the wind with an outer boundary , as if a supersonic wind interacts with a wall shock to sustain the temperature and density suitable for the @xmath0-process .",
    "the entropy per baryon and the dynamical timescale for model  c with this @xmath22 are displayed in figures  1b and 1c by thin - solid lines .",
    "this small reduction of @xmath22 increases the entropy per baryon only about a few percents .",
    "the dynamical timescale also increases by a factor of @xmath64 for @xmath65  ergs  s@xmath4 . for @xmath66  ergs  s@xmath4 , however ,",
    "the dynamical timescale increases drastically .",
    "this is because the winds pass @xmath52 with @xmath67  mev for higher luminosity cases .",
    "furthermore , the velocity and the radial gradient in temperature significantly decrease after the wind crosses @xmath52 for a subsonic wind ( paper  i ) .",
    "this situation that the dynamical timescale becomes significantly longer at an early stage is similar to the results of previous detailed hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , the @xmath0-process would not take place in the winds for @xmath66  ergs  s@xmath4 owing to the too long dynamical timescales , as to be confirmed by nucleosynthesis calculations in the next section .",
    "note that the entropy per baryon for @xmath68  ergs  s@xmath4 and the dynamical timescale for @xmath69  ergs  s@xmath4 are not displayed in figures  1a and 1b , since the temperature at @xmath70  km , where the calculation is stopped , is higher than 0.5  mev and 0.2  mev , respectively .",
    "nucleosynthesis yields from the @xmath0-process were calculated for the three neutrino - driven wind models discussed in the previous section .",
    "we used a fully implicit nuclear reaction network for both the @xmath1-rich freezeout and the subsequent @xmath0-process .",
    "the network consists of over 3000 isotopes all the way from neutron and proton up to the plutonium isotopes .",
    "we include all relevant reactions , i.e. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and their inverse .",
    "reaction rates were taken from thielemann ( 1995 ) for nuclei with @xmath77 and from cowan , thielemann , & truran ( 1991 ) for those with @xmath78 .",
    "weak interactions such as @xmath79-decay , @xmath79-delayed neutron emission , electron capture , and the capture of electron and anti - electron neutrinos on free nucleons were also included .",
    "these neutrino capture processes are of importance as they reduce the number of free neutrons by the `` @xmath1-effect '' ( meyer , mclaughlin , & fuller 1998 ) .",
    "note that fission reactions are not included .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations were carried out in nine trajectories with neutrino luminosities between @xmath80 and 51.0 in intervals of 0.2  dex .",
    "the mass ejection rates were taken to be @xmath62 as described in the previous section .",
    "each calculation started when the temperature decreased to @xmath81 ( where @xmath82  k ) .",
    "at this point the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) consists mostly of free nucleons .",
    "the initial mass fractions of neutrons and protons were therefore given by nse plus charge neutrality : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the initial electron fraction @xmath85 was set to be 0.40 , which is near the lower bound for neutrino - heated ejecta from the models of woosley et al .",
    "this approximation is adequate for our study , although ultimately the initial electron fraction should be determined by the detailed balance of the energy and luminosity between electron and anti - electron neutrinos with a hydrodynamic study .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the final abundance of each trajectory for model  c as a function of mass number .",
    "it is found that the trajectories with @xmath86 ( figure  2d - i ) result in a robust @xmath0-process .",

    "figure  3 shows the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath89 ( solid line ) , the mass fraction of seed nuclei @xmath90 ( dashed line ) , and the electron fraction @xmath85 ( dot - dashed line ) at @xmath91 , which is approximately the temperature at the beginning of the @xmath0-process phase . here",

    "however , the total abundance of @xmath0-process nuclei produced from this trajectory is small . this is because the mass fraction of seed nuclei obtains the minimum value at this luminosity , as can be seen in figure  3 .",
    "note that @xmath94 is smaller for @xmath66  ergs  s@xmath4 despite higher @xmath90 owing to the smaller neutron - to - seed ratio . for lower luminosities",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath79-delayed neutron emission smoothes the abundance pattern as seen in figure  2 , because of the longer dynamical timescales ( figure  1 ) .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section , trajectories for @xmath98 ( figures  2a - c ) do not contribute significantly to the @xmath0-process , because of the too long dynamical timescales ( figure  1c ) .",
    "neutrino capture on free nucleons somewhat increases the electron fraction to @xmath99 at @xmath91 by the @xmath1-effect ( @xcite ) as seen in figure  3 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "thus , it is important to include the neutrino capture reactions in order to correctly calculate the resulting @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "this effect is not , however , as serious as that suggested by meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the present @xmath0-process conditions .",

    "( 1998 ) was fixed at a value as large as @xmath100  s.    in order to compare the nucleosynthesis results of each model with the solar - system @xmath0-process abundances , the yields were integrated over the mass - weighted time history in the following manner .",
    "the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity is approximately given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the initial neutrino luminosity at the neutrino sphere , and @xmath103 is the cooling timescale .",

    "our results suggest that proto - neutron stars with a large compaction ratio ( @xmath140 ; models  b and c ) , where general relativistic effects are important , provide the best conditions for the @xmath0-process .",
    "such compact proto - neutron stars lead to sufficiently high entropy @xmath141 and short dynamical timescales @xmath88  ms to produce an optimum neutron to seed ratio for material in the neutrino - driven winds .",
    "the total time - integrated yields from these models are in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process abundance pattern especially for nuclei with @xmath142 .",
    "our short dynamical timescale and assumed condition of steady - flow equilibrium for material in the winds lead to a good @xmath0-process even at early times when the neutrino luminosity is still high @xmath143  ergs  s@xmath4 . as a result",
    ", the overproduction of nuclei @xmath5 is significantly reduced , compared to that of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although being still overproduced by a factor of @xmath118 .",
    "our results also suggest that , for models of the same compaction ratio , e.g. , b and c , a higher neutron - star mass yields more @xmath0-process material .",
    "this is due to the somewhat longer dynamical timescale for material ejected from high - mass neutron stars which increases the amount of seed nuclei .",
    "the implication of these two results is that an optimum @xmath0-process which does not overproduce @xmath144 nuclei may require both a well developed bubble and a massive proto - neutron star while the @xmath0-process elements are synthesized .",
    "it should be noted that we presume that the bubble is already evacuated and a steady - state wind developed for all neutrino luminosities . for the dynamical supernova model of woosley",
    "et al . ( 1994 ) , however , the proto - neutron star is still relaxing and the bubble slowly expanding during the first @xmath13  s. in the model  c of this study , the @xmath0-process starts at @xmath145  ergs ( figure  2 ) , which corresponds to 1.7  s in equation  ( 5 ) . at @xmath146  ergs , therefore , the entropy per baryon might be somewhat overestimated , although the dynamical timescale as a function of @xmath30 shows a similar trend to those of previous hydrodynamic studies ( figure  1c ) .",
    "a detailed hydrodynamic study of the neutrino - induced explosion for a massive supernova progenitor will be eventually needed to confirm whether the early stage of the neutrino - driven winds from compact neutron stars are really the astrophysical site of the @xmath0-process .",
    "alternatively , this scenario might occur if the low entropy material initially ejected from the supernova were to fall back onto the neutron star .",
    "this would produce the massive remnant .",
    "this epoch might then follow by a second epoch of high neutrino flux into the previously evacuated bubble .",
    "this might occur , for example , if the proto - neutron star were to experience a late transition to strange matter and subsequent neutrino emission or a late softening and heating by kaon condensation ( thorsson , prakash , & lattimer 1994 ) .",
    "for example , the softening of a proto - neutron star by kaon condensation is estimated to occur in a few to 10 seconds after core bounce ( @xcite ) , which may be relevant to the @xmath0-process in this study . in either case , it is clear that these new results could suggest an interesting new twist to the supernova paradigm .",
    "if these models for the @xmath0-process are correct , then our results could also pose a significant constraint on the equation of state for the neutron - star remnant .",
    "a summary of the mass - radius relationship of some contemporary equations of state is shown in figure  6 .",
    "these are compared with the various models considered in this work .",
    "these representative equations of state include an example of a non - relativistic nucleon potential model equation of state with both two - body and three - body terms ( av14 + uvii ; wiringa , fiks , & fabrocini 1988 ) as well as various relativistic mean field equations of state , including those based upon a relativistic hartree ( g ; glendenning 1989 and hv ; glendenning 1985 ) , hartree fock ( hvf ; weber & weigel 1989 ) calculation and those with strange - matter interiors ( ss1 & ss2 ; glendenning & weber 1992 ) .    model  a with @xmath147 and @xmath148  km is a typical neutron star mass and a typical radius for a non - relativistic eos and several relativistic ones as well .",
    "however , it does not produce a good @xmath0-process in our simulations .",
    "generating the observed abundance curve seems to require a slightly more exotic paradigm .",
    "if we consider our best @xmath0-process model , i.e. model  c with @xmath149 and @xmath150  km , we see that many of the equations of state lead to such a remnant . in all cases , however , such a massive remnant is very close to or equal to the maximum mass allowed by the eos .",
    "if such a remnant is required to produce the @xmath0-process , then it seems that the @xmath0-process must occur for a remnant that has accreted to its maximum mass and is about to collapse to a black hole .",
    "this suggests another possible paradigm in which the @xmath0-process occurs in the previously evacuated bubble by neutrinos generated as the short - lived proto - neutron star begins its collapse to a black hole ( see also qian , vogel , & wasserburg 1998 ) .",
    "this would perhaps require that the @xmath0-process occurs in a more massive progenitor star which does not leave a neutron star remnant such as probably occurred in sn 1987a ( @xcite ) .",
    "although model  b with @xmath147 and @xmath151  km also gives a reasonable @xmath0-process abundance distribution , it is very difficult to form such a compact neutron star of this mass .",
    "such lower - mass high compaction stars could perhaps form if a strange matter core develops as in ss1 and ss2 of figure  6 .",
    "the results of this study are also of importance for the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "ishimaru & wanajo ( 1999 ) have suggested that the large dispersion of europium with respect to iron among metal - poor stars in the galactic halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can be reproduced if the @xmath0-process elements originate from stars of @xmath152 or @xmath153 .",
    "our results also imply that , for a given equation of state , a more massive proto - neutron star leads to a smaller compaction ratio and therefore more favorable conditions for the @xmath0-process . furthermore ,",
    "if the maximum mass of a proto - neutron star were as large as @xmath154 , the progenitor star is probably very massive . such stars with @xmath155 account for only @xmath156 of all supernova progenitors with a typical initial mass function . nevertheless , the amount of @xmath0-process matter in model  c is about a factor of 2 higher than that of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , so that such a restriction to high mass stars may be reasonable .",
    "it should be noted that , even if neutrino - driven winds fail to reproduce the solar @xmath0-pattern especially of the third peak , they still could be significant sources of the solar @xmath0-elements of at least the second peak and lighter .",
    "if that is the case , heavier @xmath0-process elements must be synthesized in other sources .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario of multiple @xmath0-process sites implied by meteoritic abundances ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ) , spectroscopic studies of metal - poor halo stars ( @xcite ) , and the chemical evolution studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could be also explained by the neutrino - driven wind models described here , which show the strong dependence of the @xmath0-process yields on the remnant mass .",
    "in fact , most of the metal - poor stars in the galactic halo show the higher ratios of light - to - heavy @xmath0-elements ( e.g. , sr / ba or sr / eu ) than that of the solar @xmath0-abundances , although the values differ from star to star by up to @xmath13 orders of magnitude ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that these @xmath0-elements might originate from the `` weak '' @xmath0-processing associated with smaller compaction ratios @xmath157 ( figures  4 and 5 ) .",
    "however , some metal - poor stars ( e.g. , cs 22892 - 052 ) show somewhat smaller ratios of light - to - heavy @xmath0-elements compared to that of the solar @xmath0-abundances , by a factor of @xmath158 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ; see also wasserburg et al .",
    "1996 for a meteoritic study ) , which can not be reproduced by any models in this study .",
    "if such low light - to - heavy ratios originate from neutrino - driven winds , we need somewhat more compact proto - neutron stars than considered in this study , otherwise we have to seek other causes to reduce the lighter @xmath0-nuclei , e.g. , fallback of the first , low entropy material ejected ( @xcite ) .    obviously , our approach of assuming constant values for the initial electron fraction , neutrino luminosity in each trajectory , the radius of the proto - neutron star , as well as an exponential time evolution of neutrino luminosity , is too simplified to conclude that these neutrino - driven wind models are an accurate description of the @xmath0-process .",
    "for example , the time variation of @xmath85 is of particular importance in the @xmath0-process .",
    "recent hydrodynamic studies of core - collapse supernovae with accurate treatments of the neutrino transport have shown that @xmath85 exceeds 0.5 for the first a few hundred ms after core bounce ( @xcite ) .",
    "if that is the case , then the overproduction of @xmath6 nuclei in our results would disappear ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the present study , the initial electron fraction was fixed at a relatively low value , 0.4 , although it increases to @xmath159 by the time of onset of the @xmath0-process .",
    "however , @xmath85 may be significantly higher than that during the early phase of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "even with a higher @xmath85 , however , a sufficient neutron - to - seed ratio could be obtained if the @xmath1-process is less efficient ( @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the yields of @xmath0-process elements might decrease owing to a smaller amount of seed material .",
    "future hydrodynamic studies of core - collapse supernovae with accurate neutrino transport , including multidimensional effects such as convection and rotation , as well as magnetic fields will probably ultimately be required before we can be certain that the neutrino - driven winds are indeed the major @xmath0-process site in the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , our results have confirmed that the scenario of neutrino - driven winds is still viable and promising as the true astrophysical site for the @xmath0-process .",
