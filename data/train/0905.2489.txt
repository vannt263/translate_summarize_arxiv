    "therefore @xmath77 can be understood as the electrostatic potential generated by a charge distribution in the plane with density @xmath78 .    for a distribution of matrix entries that is uniform in the unit disk ,",

    "other measures could be used , as the inverse participation ratio or the shannon entropy ; in this case the eigenvectors are peaked on small intervals , and the variance has a clear meaning .",
