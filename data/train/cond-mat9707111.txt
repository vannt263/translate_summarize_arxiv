    "the transresistivity is often interpreted in terms of a drag rate which , in analogy with a drude model , is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron density of the driving layer and @xmath8 is the electron effective mass .",

    "the experimental results at around 23  k , on the other hand , showed@xcite ( 1 ) a well - defined peak in the @xmath18 , ( 2 ) a local maximum in @xmath19 near equal layer densities and ( 3 ) an approximately @xmath3-independent residual @xmath19 , after subtraction of the coulomb contribution which can be identified experimentally by its simple @xmath3 and @xmath21 dependencies .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally measured magnitude of @xmath19 was generally larger by about a factor of 2 than the value predicted by the coulomb interaction alone .",
    "another momentum transfer mechanism was clearly involved .    from the outset",
    "it was understood that exchange of acoustic phonons was the most likely candidate for this second momentum transfer mechanism .",
    "exchange of phonons often dominates electron - electron scattering contributions to the resistance of bulk metals.@xcite the peak in the temperature dependence of @xmath18 is reminiscent of features in the temperature dependence of the acoustic phonon limited mobility , and occurs around the bloch - grneisen temperature @xmath22 associated with the acoustic phonon modes .",

    "the phase - space available for scattering is largest for @xmath24 transfers , partially explaining the enhanced drag when @xmath25 . finally , the long - ranged exchange of phonons between electrically isolated systems is not an unknown phenomenon .",
    "exchange of phonons between two 3d systems separated by @xmath26 m has been observed previously,@xcite and related effects are expected to be observable in a superlattice if the driving electron layer is hot@xcite .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to explain the magnitude of the observed drag and its dependence on layer separation and density .    since interactions of acoustic phonons with electrons are relatively weak in gaas , the fact that phonon - mediated and coulomb contribution to the drag are often comparable seems mysterious .",
    "however , we show below that the obvious calculation , in which a free phonon propagator substitutes for the coulomb interaction , leads to a divergent drag resistivity .",
    "the large but finite drag rates which are observed experimentally can be explained in terms of scattering and interaction effects which alter the phonon propagator .    despite the apparent importance of phonon exchange in drag measurements ,",
    "there has been less theoretical work on this mechanism than on the coulomb coupling mechanism .",

    "phonon interaction , they predicted a short range phonon - mediated drag . in spite of the use of radically different models for the phonon - mediated process , both these calculations yielded a temperature dependence for the drag in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the similarity is not surprising because of the common appearance of the bloch - grneisen temperature scale associated with the acoustic phonon mode .",
    "comparable features in the drag , associated with plasmon modes of the electronic system , were predicted@xcite and observed@xcite at higher temperatures .",
    "in this paper we report on a detailed examination of the phonon exchange mechanism for drag , using a model which we believe to be quantitatively reliable for gaas / alas quantum well systems .",
    "we address distance- , temperature- , and density dependence of the transresistivity .",
    "we show that two different regimes of layer separation dependence can occur , depending on the phonon mean free path and the electron  phonon coupling constant .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a coupled electron - phonon mode , which for long phonon mean free paths leads to a large enhancement of the drag .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we use a kubo linear response formalism to obtain a formula for the transresistivity which is sufficiently general to permit the incorporation of a finite phonon mean - free - path and renormalization of the phonon propagator due to coupling to the electronic layers . in section  [ inter ]",

    "phonon interaction can lead to a surprisingly large contribution to the drag .",
    "the two different regimes of @xmath1 are discussed in section  [ couplemode ] and [ phdamped ] , where approximate expressions for @xmath19 are derived and special attention is paid to the layer separation dependence of the drag .",

    "it will turn out to be important to account for disorder and anharmonicity in the lattice system .",
    "we will do so using a phenomenological approach by introducing a phonon mean free path , @xmath1 .",

    "instead there is a peak when @xmath354 .",
    "beyond this layer separation , the electron - phonon collective mode of the double quantum well begins to decouple into two weakly coupled modes centered around each well .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ intgrdfig ] , where we compare the frequency integrands for @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "as @xmath3 is increased further beyond @xmath357 the transresistivity eventually resumes its decline .",
    "phonon exchange contributes importantly to the frictional drag resistance between nearby electron layers and is the dominant drag mechanism at large two - dimensional layer separations . in this paper",
    "we have reported on a thorough theoretical analysis of this drag mechanism .",
    "we find that drag includes contributions due to exchange of both virtual and real phonons , and that novel coupled collective modes of the 2d electron and 3d phonon systems can play a role depending on sample geometry and material parameters .",
    "we distinguish two regimes based on the relationship between the phonon mean free path and a crossover length scale @xmath155 which is typically of the order of @xmath358 mm .",
    "it is possible that the mean free path for high quality mbe grown heterostructures can exceed @xmath155 at low temperatures .    in the short mean free path regime",
    "the dominant drag processes at momentum transfer @xmath146 have energy transfer just below @xmath359 for virtual and just above @xmath359 for real phonons .",
    "the drag rate in this case decreases logarithmically with layer separation @xmath3 , until @xmath3 reaches @xmath360 .",
    "the weak layer separation dependence comes nearly entirely from the virtual - phonon exchange contribution . for @xmath361 ,",
    "the virtual - phonon exchange contribution is small and the real - phonon exchange contribution decreases exponentially with layer separation .",
    "the real - phonon exchange contribution to the drag is consistent with expectations based on the coupled boltzmann equations for the electron and phonon systems , and the exponential fall off for @xmath361 can be understood in terms of the decay length for the disturbance of the steady state phonon system as the result of current flowing in one of the electron layers .    for samples with",
    "phonon mean free paths larger than @xmath155 a new collective mode involving both electronic and lattice degrees of freedom emerges below the continuum of 3d phonon energies with 2d wavevectors @xmath146 near @xmath161 .",
    "the existence of this mode enhances the drag . in this regime",
    "the drag also has a roughly logarithmic layer separation until @xmath3 reaches another crossover length @xmath362 . for typical samples @xmath363 m .",
    "at this layer separation the collective mode separates into weakly coupled modes associated with the individual 2d layers .",
    "although the the drag has a complicated and non - monotonic layer separation in this regime , it does ultimately decline with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "these findings are summarized in table ( [ sumtable ] ) .",
    "there are , unfortunately , few existing experiments on the long distance dependence of the phonon mediated drag resistivity . more experimental work will be needed to understand the range of possible behaviors and their dependence on system parameters .",
    "we note , however , that the preliminary experimental results by gramila et al.@xcite are consistent with a logarithmic @xmath3-dependence .",
