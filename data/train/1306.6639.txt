    "a gold tip is moved repeatedly at a steady rate towards and away from an evaporated gold film , such that atomic - scale au junctions are made and broken cyclically .",
    "we perform electrical measurements during this process , cycling an applied voltage @xmath31 across the junction ( and a series resistor ) and measuring the corresponding current . a lock - in approach",
    "simultaneously gives the change in integrated radio frequency noise , proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath29 is the voltage drop across the junction .",
    "the radio frequency band employed in the experimental analysis here is from 250 to 600 mhz ; data taken with a bandwidth from 400 to 800 mhz is qualitatively identical . to obtain the ensemble - averaged noise as a function of bias at a given conductance , conductance and noise histograms ( 500 - 1000 breaking traces )",
    "are acquired at many applied voltage levels .",
    "figure  [ fig.2 ] shows a representative conductance histogram , along with ensemble - averaged noise as a function of conductance acquired at several different bias voltages .",
    "the ensemble - averaged data are then binned by conductance and plotted as a function of @xmath29 . in the picture of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitet ] ) , for bias - independent electron temperature and a given junction configuration , plotting @xmath33 as a function of the scaled bias @xmath34 $ ] , should give a straight line with a slope that is precisely the zero - temperature fano factor @xmath35 . in our case",
    "we expect to find the _ ensemble - averaged _ fano factor , @xmath36 . by fixing the conductance ,",
    "we have specified @xmath37 , so that the slope should be @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig.3](a ) shows low bias linear fits at several different conductances away from the peaks in the conductance histograms . as reported previously,@xcite small nonlinearities in these scaled plots",
    "were observed for conductances close to quantum suppression points , ascribed to extra bias - induced excess noise caused by flicker noise ( and possibly some electronic heating of the type discussed below ) while shot noise is minimized at suppressions .",
    "after further increasing bias to higher levels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3](b ) , significant nonlinearities as a function of scaled bias are present at all the conductance values , well above the extrapolated linear dependence found at low bias . here",
    "different markers represent different independent data sets while each color indicates a particular conductance value .",
    "the solid lines are the low bias linear fits . in all the data sets ,",
    "the nonlinearity is concave upward and independent of the order in which the voltages were applied ( high to low ; low to high ; or interleaved ) .",
    "this indicates that the nonlinearity is an intrinsic function of the bias , not a result of irreversible changes to the junctions during the sequence of histogram acquisition at different applied biases .",
    "the rather similar fano factors in the several @xmath39 range is consistent with our earlier measurements,@xcite and may imply the involvement of more quantum channels , suggesting an approach to noise properties similar to those in the diffusive regime.@xcite",
    "at a given conductance , at comparatively low bias , the measured noise scales with bias as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitet ] ) . at comparatively high bias ,",
    "the measured noise increases more rapidly than this expectation .",
    "we must consider possible explanations for this trend in the noise at high bias .",
    "possible contributors include : flicker noise ; significant heating of the electronic reservoirs ( region b in fig .",
    "[ fig.intro ] ) ; electron - phonon inelastic corrections to the noise ; and _ local _ electronic heating ( in region c of fig .",
    "[ fig.intro ] ) .",
    "flicker noise is produced by fluctuations in the device resistance due to scattering of the electrons by dynamical defects@xcite . at low bias ,",
    "such that the dynamical defects remain effectively at @xmath2 , flicker noise manifests as a voltage noise power that scales quadratically in the applied dc bias . at higher biases , because of the availablity of carriers as much as @xmath3 above the local equilibrium fermi level , the dynamical defects can have effective temperatures ( of their ionic degrees of freedom ) that are considerably elevated@xcite .",
    "the result of this ionic heating is increased flicker noise as more defects are able to participate , and a bias dependence of the voltage noise that is super - quadratic@xcite .",
    "the operative question is whether the increased noise we see at high bias is indicative of this kind of enhanced flicker noise contribution .",
    "we assess the role of flicker noise in multiple ways : considering the overall contribution of flicker noise to the total noise signal ; examining the scaling of noise response with rf frequency range ; and examining the expected dependence of noise on bias and junction conductance .",
    "the noise measurements in this work are broadband and in the rf regime , a frequency range ( 250 mhz to 600 mhz ) considerably higher than that in which flicker noise is typically measured .",
    "the presence of strong noise suppression at 1 @xmath40 at the highest biases ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig.2 ] ) establishes that the bulk of the measured noise likely results from shot noise of the type described at low bias by eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitet ] ) .",
    "we have also performed noise measurements with a different rf filter set ( limiting the band to between 400 mhz and 800 mhz ) at a variety of biases . while environmental backgrounds proved more annoying over that higher frequency band , the relative magnitude of the noise suppression near values of quantized conductance is essentially unchanged .",
    "this again is consistent with the significant majority of the total measured noise being shot noise , since one would expect overall reduced flicker noise at the higher frequencies .",
    "we look at the bias dependence of the noise . in previous measurements,@xcite when looking at 1  @xmath40 , where the shot noise contribution is maximally ( but not completely ) suppressed , we found residual nonlinearity with bias in the ensemble - averaged noise power at low bias that was roughly consistent with a flicker noise contribution .",
    "we repeat such an analysis here .",
    "note that the superlinear behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig.3](b ) is as a function of _ scaled _ bias , not just @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig.4 ] shows the measured noise ( converted to voltage noise , @xmath41 ) as a function of bias across the junction , @xmath29 , for @xmath42 .",
    "the data are well described as a linear + quadratic term .",
    "there is no clear evidence of any superquadratic dependence of the type expected for high bias flicker noise .    finally , we consider the expected dependence of noise with the junction conductance",
    ". we can be overly conservative and ascribe _ all _ of the nonlinearity in @xmath41 as a function of @xmath29 to flicker noise .",
    "this knowingly _ overestimates _ the magnitude of flicker noise at 1  @xmath40 , since the true finite - temperature expression for shot noise ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) has some nonlinearity due to the @xmath43 factor .",
    "previous experimental work at lower frequencies ( @xmath44  khz)@xcite used lithographically defined mechanical break junctions at cryogenic temperatures to examine flicker noise down to conductances comparable to @xmath40 in individual junction configurations . in those experiments , for a fixed bandwidth , the investigators found that the _ ensemble - averaged _ flicker noise scales like @xmath45 as junctions approach the ballistic regime , though there is variation within the ensemble . in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] , we compare the bias - dependent noise at 3 @xmath40 with that at 1 @xmath40 ( dashed line ) .",
    "contrary to the ensemble - average scaling expectation for flicker noise , we find that the observed nonlinearity at 3  @xmath40 is nearly two times larger than the overestimate of the 1  @xmath40 flicker noise .",
    "while large variations are possible between the noise properties of individual junctions,@xcite this trend ( greater nonlinearity vs. @xmath29 and noise magnitude at higher conductance than at lower conductance ) is robust throughout our ensemble - averaged measurements , in both rf frequency bands used , and goes against expectations for flicker noise from previous studies.@xcite thus , based on limits to the overall contribution of flicker noise to the total measured signal , and the systematic noise response as a function of frequency band , bias , and junction conductance , we find it quantitatively unlikely that the increase in noise observed at high bias in fig .",
    "[ fig.3](b ) is a result of flicker noise .    a second possible explanation for the observed data that must be considered is heating of the `` reservoir '' electrodes due to current flow . in prior experiments by henny",
    "_ et al.__@xcite considering shot noise at cryogenic temperatures in a diffusive wire connected to thick film reservoirs , the heating of those reservoirs was definitely non - negligible . in the present experiment ,",
    "the situation is considerably different : an atomic - scale junction in what is usually considered the ballistic regime , at _ room temperature _",
    ", with most of the dissipation happening in effectively bulk reservoirs .",
    "the au tip has a measured electrical resistance of less than 1  @xmath46 , and the sheet resistance of the au film is similarly around 2  @xmath46 .",
    "the question is whether power dissipation near the junction could , through the finite thermal resistance of the electrodes , lead to significant heating of the electrodes ( both electrons and phonons ) near the junction . to be very conservative ,",
    "assume that only the electronic component of the thermal conductivity is relevant .",
    "furthermore , assume that 100% of the dissipated power is deposited in _ either one _ of the electrodes proximal to the junction . for 300  mv bias across a 3  k@xmath46 junction , the power @xmath47  w , and",
    "this must correspond to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the local temperature of the reservoir electrode near the junction , @xmath2 is the environmental temperature , @xmath50  w  @xmath46/k@xmath16 is the lorenz number , and @xmath51 is the conductance of the reservoir , in this case one siemens . for @xmath52",
    "k , we find @xmath53  k. in the real situation , when roughly half of the power will be dissipated in the other electrode@xcite and phonons will contribute significantly to the thermal path in both electrodes , the actual local temperature rise of the bulk electrodes ( region b in fig .",
    "[ fig.intro ] ) is expected to be even smaller .",
    "note that this simple estimate based on the electronic thermal conduction is independent of the detailed electrode geometry .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this kind of reservoir heating , while definitely important in the cryogenic experiments of henny _ _ et al.__@xcite , is unlikely to be a significant contributor to the high bias noise increase in the present work .    at the biases considered in this work , and at room temperature , it is important to consider the possible effects of electron - vibrational coupling on the measured noise . as mentioned previously",
    ", there are many theoretical predictions describing electronic transport in small , ballistic junctions coupled to a local vibrational mode .",
    "@xcite in an individual junction one expects a modification in the fano factor of the shot noise as the bias exceeds the characteristic energy of the vibrational mode .",
    "the change in @xmath26 depends sensitively on the particular channel transmittance@xcite , as well as the coupling of the channels to the phonon degree of freedom .",
    "a detailed comparison with particular theoretical descriptions is difficult : our data is in the ensemble average , generally with multiple contributing channels ; if one expects the au optical phonon to be a dominant contribution , our data is acquired at the limit @xmath54 so that finite thermal phonon population is possible .",
    "a detailed consideration of ensemble averaging over channel distributions would have to match the observed increase in enhanced noise at higher conductances .",
    "however , the observed power law dependence of the excess noise , @xmath55 , experimentally constrains possible phonon - based mechanisms for the increase in noise at high bias .",
    "descriptions that assume strong pumping of the local phonon population by the electrons predict voltage dependences with @xmath56 and @xmath57 contributions@xcite . for vibrational effects to be responsible for the enhanced noise , the ensemble - averaged system must be in the `` equilibrated phonon '' limit , such that the local phonon population @xmath58 remains bias independent@xcite .",
    "this suggests an experimental test for this mechanism . by performing such measurements as substrate temperatures",
    "are decreased down to the cryogenic regime , one would expect decreases in the local phonon population , and therefore decreases in such nonlinear corrections to the noise .",
    "given that temperature gradients within the bulk of the electrodes are small , an additional possible explanation for the observed trends in the measured noise would be some amount of effective electronic heating _",
    "local _ to the junction ( that is , electronic distribution functions impinging locally on the ballistic region ( region d ) that evolve nontrivially with bias for reasons other than bulk heating of the reservoirs ( region b ) ) .",
    "for example , the single - particle scattering formalism neglects electronic heating due to the electronic viscosity , inherently an effect of electron - electron interactions.@xcite before addressing this specific proposal , we attempt to assess whether the observed trend could be consistent with some broadened electronic distribution function ( the idea that @xmath13 describing the components of the nonequilibrium distribution function in region c of fig .  [ fig.intro ] is bias - dependent ) . to do this",
    ", we parametrize the true nonthermal carrier distribution at the junction location through an _ effective _ electronic temperature , @xmath59 , that depends on the bias , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitet ] ) .",
    "obviously , a general nonequilibrium distribution does not have to be parametrized by a single effective temperature ; however , some kind of parametrization is necessary to perform an analysis , and this is closely related to the approach of henny _ et al . _ when considering `` traditional '' electronic heating .",
    "we employ the landauer transmittance expression and the resulting eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitet ] ) , but assume that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ambient temperature , @xmath62  300  k. to further simplify the analysis , we leverage the fact that @xmath63 in the high bias regime of interest . we can then move forward approximating @xmath64 , which we will check for self - consistency ( to make sure that this continues to hold for the inferred @xmath59 ) .",
    "thus eq .",

    "the ensemble - averaged fano factor , @xmath26 , can be determined from the low bias data described above .",
    "the only missing information is the ratio @xmath70 . for our ensemble - averaged measurements , by specifying @xmath71 we then need to find the ensemble average @xmath72 . while in a single junction with fano factor @xmath73",
    ", one can write the parameter of interest as @xmath74 , note that in general one can not assume that @xmath75 , where @xmath26 is the ensemble average .    we can consider models of channel mixing to illuminate possible values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] .",
    "the dotted line represents the fano factor , the solid blue line @xmath76 , and the solid red line @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig.5](a ) represents one limiting case , no channel mixture at all , with each channel turning on linearly sequence as the conductance is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig.5](b ) assumes much stronger mixing of the channels , so strong that there would be little detectable shot noise suppression in this limit . in both limits ,",
    "the ratio of interest approaches a constant ( one ) quickly after the conductance is increased above 1 @xmath39 . as the diffusive limit is approached,@xcite @xmath77 because of partially open channels , meaning @xmath78 . in either case , it is safe to approximate @xmath79 as a constant on the order of 1 when @xmath71 is much above @xmath80 ( though the precise value introduces a systematic uncertainty in what follows ) . within this approximation",
    ", we can evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : elt ] ) , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] .",
    "the effective electronic temperature elevations in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] are calculated from the data sets used to produce fig .",
    "[ fig.3](b ) . in this figure , 13 conductance values are chosen , representative of conductances higher than @xmath40 .",
    "the approximation @xmath64 is only valid outside the shaded region . at a bias of several hundred mv , within this model an effective electronic temperature elevation as high as 350",
    "k is inferred .",
    "the error bars are dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath26 , as inferred from @xmath81 of the linear fits in fig .",
    "[ fig.3](a ) .",
    "these local electronic temperature elevations are the same order as those inferred through completely independent experiments employing indirect optical methods@xcite and bond rupture measurements.@xcite    we use a deliberately simplistic model to check the reasonableness of these @xmath82 values .",
    "the inferred effective temperature elevations are approximately independent of conductance , which is consistent with a local electronic heating picture assuming a balance between local power generation and heat current carried by the electrons.@xcite in this local heating picture , some fraction @xmath83 of the total joule heating is dissipated local to the junction , @xmath84 .",
    "( in the standard approach , @xmath83 would be zero ; given the general success of the standard approach , the expectation is that @xmath83 should be small compared to one . )",
    "since the electron - phonon inelastic mean free path is much longer than the junction size , the electrons must carry away the heat generated . in the limit of local quasithermal energy distributions",
    "( so that a local electronic temperature is well defined ) for the outgoing carriers , the electronic thermal conductance is @xmath85 .",
    "balancing the joule heating with the thermal current @xmath86 leads to a predicted local temperature of @xmath87 .",
    "the observed data are roughly consistent with this for @xmath88 , not bad considering the simplicity of the model , which assumes the wiedemann - franz law and no dependence of the @xmath19 on bias .",
    "the inferred @xmath82 seems to increase more rapidly than this dependence at higher bias ; this simple model may be inadequate , assuming for example that the transmittances @xmath19 are independent of bias ( generally not a poor assumption for au over this energy range@xcite ) .",
    "we see that the observed noise trend could be explained by a relatively modest amount of electronic heating local to the junction ( dissipating 2% of the total power in region c of fig .",
    "[ fig.intro ] , though in general one would expect @xmath83 to depend on the conductance ) .",
    "we now consider whether there is a physical mechanism that could contribute this amount of local electronic heating . indeed ,",
    "similar to the local , nonequilibrium ionic heating due to electron - phonon interactions , the internal coulomb friction of the electron liquid is predicted to create local electron heating @xcite . due to the large current densities in nanojunctions",
    "compared to their bulk counterparts the electron - electron scattering rate increases locally in the junction  @xcite .",
    "the underlying fermi sea thus `` heats up '' locally due to this increased scattering , via production of electron - hole pairs whose energy needs to be dissipated away from the junction .",
    "this would manifest itself in the noise just as an elevated electronic temperature does so in the regime of henny _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the local effect was first computed in au nanojunctions@xcite assuming no dependence of the electronic viscosity on the junction geometry , namely on the electron transmission . using the viscosity of that work , namely @xmath89 pa - sec for the electron liquid of density comparable to gold ( @xmath90 )",
    ", we obtain an estimate of @xmath82 that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] .",
    "the drawback of neglecting the dependence of viscosity on junction geometry was however understood and corrected in roy _ _ et al.__@xcite , where the zero frequency viscosity @xmath91 was evaluated as the product of the high - frequency shear modulus @xmath92 and a junction - specific momentum relaxation time @xmath93 .",
    "the actual scattering potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite to compute @xmath93 was chosen precisely to model au quantum point contacts . by referring to fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] of ref .",
    "@xcite we see that @xmath94 pa sec for the transmissions typical of these point contacts . since the zero - frequency viscosity enters as the square root of its value in the effective electronic temperature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) we obtain a value of @xmath95 , a factor @xmath96 higher than the one fitted in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] , a very reasonable agreement considering that the actual geometry of the junction is not known .",
    "this quantitative consistency between the modeled experiment and this theoretical treatment suggests that the electronic viscosity should definitely be considered as a potential contributor to the observed enhanced noise . within this theoretical picture",
    "the effective electronic heating depends strongly on the transmittance , implying that such heating would be much less important in lower conductance structures such as molecular junctions , where it might be detected through inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy linewidths.@xcite .",
    "we further note that this electron - electron interaction effect should be comparatively independent of the background equilibrium temperature .",
    "therefore , measurements of the scaling of noise at high bias at lower substrate temperatures should allow the discrimination between electron - vibrational enhancement of the noise discussed above and this local electronic heating mechanism .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have conducted excess noise measurements in scanning tunneling microscope - style au break junctions at room temperature and observed a nonlinear bias dependence of the noise exceeding the expectations for shot noise in the landauer formalism at fixed electron temperature .",
    "the magnitude of this extra noise is inconsistent with flicker noise or heating of the bulk electrodes as possible confounding effects .",
    "nonequilibrium electron - vibrational effects could be relevant , but the observed power law of the noise increase suggests that any participating local phonon modes are not pumped significantly by the electrons . interpreting the increased noise in terms of a model of local electronic heating , we find that the additional noise implies an effective electron temperature ( defined through the width of the fd distributions impinging on the ballistic junction ) elevated by as much as 300  k at 0.3 v bias .",
    "a theoretical treatment accounting for the effects of electronic viscosity is shown to be roughly consistent with such a value .",
    "it is important to note again that this noise method is only one way to parametrize the local nonequilibrium electronic distribution by an effective temperature .",
    "the temperature determined this way may not be identical to a local , nonequilibrium temperature defined@xcite through the lack of net average transport of energy between a reservoir and the nonequilibrium system .",
    "additional experiments looking at electronic heating as a function of environmental temperature and transmittance should further constrain theoretical models of this nonequilibrium phenomenon , and make it possible to distinguish between electron - vibrational and electron - electron contributions to the enhanced noise .",
    "a schematic of the measurement system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] . a function generator at 10 khz cycles the applied bias between zero and a particular level @xmath31 .",
    "this low frequency bias passes through a bias - tee and is applied to the tip ; the film is connected , via the dc port of another bias - tee , through a resistance standard ( as a current limiter ) set to @xmath97  2  k@xmath46 , and then to a current preamplifier .",
    "the current preamplifier output is measured directly by a high speed data acquisition ( daq ) card as well as feeding into a lock - in amplifier synced to the 10 khz bias .",
    "knowing @xmath98 and the current , we calculate the true voltage drop across the junction , @xmath29 .",
    "the high - frequency port of one bias - tee is terminated at 50  ohms , while the other bias - tee s high frequency port is connected to an amplifier chain , a filter set to define the bandwidth ( either 250 mhz to 600 mhz , or 400 mhz to 800 mhz ) , and then to a logarithmic power meter .",
    "the power meter output is read directly by the daq and is also directed into a second ( `` noise '' ) lock - in amplifier synced to the low frequency bias .",
    "this second lock - in measures the component of the radio frequency noise ( integrated over the gain - bandwidth product of the system including the amplifier chain ) due to the applied `` dc '' bias .",
    "the noise lock - in signal ( measuring the mean square voltage signal on the power detector ) includes a background ( independent of junction conductance and bias conditions ) due to amplifier noise that may be subtracted away from the ensemble - averaged power measurements .",
    "measurements of the junction s rf reflectance over the bandwidth as a function of conductance are essentially featureless between 0.1  @xmath40 and 8  @xmath40 , showing that the efficiency of the out - coupling of rf noise from the junction varies little over that conductance range .",

    "<S> heating in nanoscale systems driven out of equilibrium is of fundamental importance , has ramifications for technological applications , and is a challenge to characterize experimentally . </S>",

    "<S> a nonlinear dependence of the noise power is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we consider candidate mechanisms for this increase , including flicker noise ( due to ionic motion ) , heating of the bulk electrodes , nonequilibrium electron - phonon effects , and local heating of the electronic distribution impinging on the ballistic junction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that flicker noise and bulk heating are quantitatively unlikely to explain the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these observations for other nanoscale systems , and experimental tests to distinguish vibrational and electron interaction mechanisms for the enhanced noise .        </S>",
    "<S> nanoscale junctions are ideal tools for investigating the fundamental processes of heating and dissipation in many - body systems driven out of equilibrium , a situation fraught with complications </S>",
    "<S> . figure  [ fig.intro ] shows some of the relevant lengthscales to consider in this problem . a ballistic constriction ( an atomic - scale junction@xcite ) bridges between macroscopic source and drain electrodes . with no bias or temperature gradient applied , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic distributions in the source and drain and throughout the junction region are described locally as fermi - dirac distributions , characterized by some electrochemical potential ( fermi energy ) and a spread in energies given by @xmath1 , the equilibrium temperature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the local phonon populations ( including optical phonons ) are characterized by the same temperature , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , any local ionic excitations such as the ubiquitous tunneling two - level systems ( tls ) undergo dynamics determined by their coupling to the equilibrium phonon and electronic distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> when a voltage bias is applied and the system is allowed to reach steady - state , the situation is considerably more complicated , as shown in figure  [ fig.intro ] . </S>",
    "<S> far from the junction ( region a ) , the widths in energy of the electronic and vibrational distributions remain described by @xmath1 , presuming that heat is transported away into the bulk effectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fermi energy of the source is raised over that of the drain by an amount @xmath3 . in the conventional treatment of such junctions@xcite , the local electronic distribution functions within regions c and d are no longer simple fermi - dirac distributions . in the drain , for example , right - moving carriers that originated in the source ( with energies @xmath4 above the fermi level of the drain ) and transmitted through the ballistic region are present . </S>",

    "<S> the electronic and ionic populations are not thermally distributed . </S>",

    "<S> taking an experimental observable ( bond strength ; current noise ; etc . ) and comparing that observable with an empirical equilibrium temperature dependence or with a theoretical model containing a temperature parameter is a long - established approach to defining an `` effective '' temperature , though one should be wary of over - interpreting the results .    in the conventional treatment of these systems@xcite , the electronic distributions _ </S>",

    "<S> it is difficult to access the electronic distributions directly , particularly the nonthermal distributions in regions c and d. these nonthermal electronic distributions have been inferred quantitatively in some elegant experiments in metals@xcite and carbon nanotubes@xcite via local tunneling measurements . </S>",

    "<S> , the relationship between fluctuations and dissipation leads to the johnson - nyquist contribution,@xcite current noise that is white over a broad frequency range with a noise power proportional to the absolute ( electronic ) temperature and the electrical conductance , @xmath15 a@xmath16/hz . </S>",
    "<S> nyquist - johnson noise is well established as a primary thermometer.@xcite additional `` excess '' or `` shot '' noise can appear when a nanostructure is biased out of equilibrium , due to the discrete nature of the electronic charge . </S>",
    "<S> previous shot noise experiments@xcite in the diffusive limit , where a metal nanostructure is large compared to the mean free paths for both elastic and electron - electron inelastic scattering ( @xmath7 ) , have found that the nyquist - johnson noise and shot noise clearly indicate elevated , bias - driven , position - dependent electronic temperatures @xmath17 in mesoscopic wires at cryogenic temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> those cryogenic experiments , accompanied by modeling , demonstrate that this heating is a result of the comparatively large thermal resistances of the reservoirs ( regions a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we must be mindful of this reservoir heating in any such experiment .    beyond this quasi - equilibration of the electron subsystem at some effective @xmath13 that takes place in region b , it is an open question whether electron - electron interactions elevate the effective electronic temperature in the immediate vicinity of the junction ( regions c and d ) . in other words , is the energetic width of the ( approximate ) fd distributions impinging on the ballistic region d the same as that at the nearby edge of region b , or are there local processes that further broaden those distributions ( corresponding to an effective local increase in @xmath13 that is not the reservoir heating described above ) ? </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : finitet ] ) has been confirmed at cryogenic@xcite and room temperature@xcite in mechanical break junctions . </S>",
    "<S> often the excess noise is characterized by the fano factor , @xmath24 , the ratio of the ( zero temperature ) bias - driven excess noise to the schottky case@xcite of electrons arriving in poissonian fashion , @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> inelastic processes coupling electrons and local vibrational modes can modify @xmath26.@xcite in the limit where electron - phonon scattering can significantly cool the electrons , @xmath27 as in macroscopic conductors.@xcite however , depending on the particular transmittance of channels , @xmath26 may be either enhanced or suppressed once @xmath3 exceeds the level splitting of the local phonon mode , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> these changes have been observed experimentally@xcite , though in multichannel junctions unraveling the details can be complicated@xcite . depending on whether the local phonon subsystem can equilibrate with bulk phonons quickly , or whether the local phonon population is pumped by the electrons , various dependences of @xmath26 on the applied bias @xmath29 </S>",

    "<S> a simple , conservative estimate shows that bulk heating of the electrodes , definitely relevant at cryogenic temperatures,@xcite is comparatively negligible in these 300  k experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we consider flicker noise as a possible contributor to the measured effect and find that this is unlikely to be quantitatively compatible with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we examine whether the increase in noise could be consistent with nonequilibrium electron - phonon effects and/or estimates of electronic heating local to the ballistic region . </S>"
