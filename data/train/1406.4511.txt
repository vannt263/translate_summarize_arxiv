    "<S> we describe a new method for extracting gravitational wave signals from pulsar timing data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that any gravitational wave signal can be decomposed into an orthogonal set of sky maps , with the number of maps equal to the number of pulsars in the timing array . </S>",
    "<S> these maps may be used as a basis to construct gravitational wave templates for any type of source , including collections of point sources . </S>",
    "<S> a variant of the standard hellings - downs correlation analysis is recovered for statistically isotropic signals . </S>",
    "<S> the template based approach allows us to probe potential anisotropies in the signal and produce maps of the gravitational wave sky .    </S>",
    "<S> millisecond pulsars emit pulse trains with a timing stability that rivals the best atomic clocks . after taking into account relative motion and propagation effects with an accurate timing model , </S>",
    "<S> the best timed pulsars have timing residuals of tens of nanoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational waves will impart a distinct variation in the timing residuals  @xcite that allows us to separate this signal from noise  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a radically different approach for analyzing timing data from an array of pulsars based on sky maps that allows us to detect anisotropy , and offers new insight into the geometrical underpinnings of the analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood of observing timing residuals @xmath0 in the presence of a gravitational wave signal @xmath1 , given a timing model with parameters @xmath2 , and a noise model with parameters @xmath3 is given by  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the network response operator , @xmath6 is the design matrix for the timing model , and @xmath7 is the noise covariance matrix . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the total number of data points . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to introduce an upper triangular cholesky decomposition for the noise : @xmath9 , and whiten the data by replacing @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to avoid introducing additional notation , we will simply refer to @xmath13 as @xmath14 _ etc _ in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the network response @xmath15 can be cast in matrix form by introducing a pixelization of the sky with @xmath16 equal - area pixels , such that the gravitational wave signal in the @xmath17 direction , @xmath18 can be represented by the element @xmath19 of the column vector @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational wave induced timing residuals in the @xmath20 pulsar in array of @xmath21 pulsars can then be written as  @xcite @xmath22 in matrix form @xmath15 , @xmath23 is a @xmath24 column vector , @xmath5 is the @xmath25 network response matrix , and @xmath1 is a @xmath26 column vector . </S>",
    "<S> there is a separate copy of @xmath27 for each time sample , but we suppress this additional index in an effort to keep the notation compact .    </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical properties of the network response operator are revealed by performing a singular value decomposition @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 columns of @xmath30 with non - zero singular values are the sky basis vectors @xmath31 , and the @xmath21 rows of @xmath32 with non - zero singular values are the range vectors @xmath33 . here we are using notation where indices in parentheses label which vector we are referencing , while indices without parentheses label the components of the vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the sky basis vectors and range vectors are related via @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the singular value for the @xmath36 component of the decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> one convenient method for computing these quantities is to use the healpix sky pixelization  @xcite . for moderate sized arrays of pulsars ( say tens to hundreds ) , </S>",
    "<S> the solution for the singular values and range vectors rapidly converges to a unique solution as the number of pixels is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a healpix @xmath37 , which has @xmath38 equal - area pixels , was sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sky pixelization is merely a computational convenience . </S>",
    "<S> any other basis can be used to represent the network response operator and the same range vectors will result . </S>",
    "<S> this has been confirmed by gair _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  @xcite using a spherical harmonic basis .    </S>",
    "<S> note that any gravitational sky @xmath1 can be decomposed into a portion that registers a response in the pulsar timing array , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , and a portion that lies in the null space of the response operator , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21 amplitudes @xmath43 of the sky basis vectors provide a natural set of variables with which to model any gravitational wave signal . </S>",
    "<S> one significant complication is that the network response operator has two terms - the earth term and the pulsar term @xmath44 the earth term is a simple matrix with components that vary slowly across the sky , while the pulsar term is a time delay operator that acts on the phase of the gravitational wave , imparting time delays in the phase seen by the @xmath36 pulsar of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the distance to the pulsar , and @xmath47 is the angle between the line of sight to the pulsar and the gravitational wave signal . for monochromatic sources </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a frequency dependent phase shift at each point on the sky . for evolving sources </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is more complicated . in either case , the components of @xmath48 oscillate rapidly across the sky , with a coherence length that is typically much less than one degree . </S>",
    "<S> since the two components of the network response matrix behave so differently , it makes sense to decompose each of them into their own set of sky basis functions and range vectors ( while @xmath49 and @xmath48 share the same range , they have different sets of orthonormal range vectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range vectors for the pulsar term have components @xmath50 - in other words , the pulsar term produces an uncorrelated response in the array . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding components of the sky basis vectors for the pulsar term have root - mean - square amplitudes equal to the antenna patterns for that pulsar : @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> . if all the pulsars in the array are equally sensitive , then the singular values for the pulsar term @xmath52 are all equal . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , after applying the cholesky whitening , the singular values scale inversely with the noise level in each pulsar : @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the four dominant pulsar - term sky basis vectors for the international pulsar timing array ( as used in the first ipta mock data challenge  @xcite ) , broken out into the two gravitational wave polarization states @xmath54 , are shown in figure [ fig : pbasis ] .     </S>",
    "<S> hz . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the 36 pulsars in the array are show as black or white dots . </S>",
    "<S> the black dots indicate the locations of the best timed pulsars , j1939 + 2134 , j0437 - 4715 , j1713 + 0747 and j1909 - 3744 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the rms sky map amplitudes are simply the antenna patterns for each of these pulsars . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the earth - term range vectors include correlations between pulsars , and the singular values vary significantly , even when all the pulsars are equally sensitive ( the singular values for an equal sensitivity array typically vary by factors of 10 to 100 from largest to smallest , depending on the specific geometry of the array ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four dominant earth term sky basis vectors for the international pulsar timing array are shown in figure [ fig : ebasis ] . </S>",
    "<S> the four best timed pulsars dominate these maps , the shapes of which can be understood from the observation that the sky basis for a single pulsar is proportional to its antenna pattern  @xcite .        in a bayesian analysis , after specifying priors for the model parameters @xmath55 , numerical techniques such as markov chain monte carlo can be used to estimate the posterior distribution function for the sky map . before discussing such an analysis </S>",
    "<S> , it is instructive to look at the maximum likelihood ( ml ) solution under the assumption that the noise model and timing model is known ( so @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the distance to each pulsar was known to exquisite accuracy , it would be possible to reconstruct both the combined earth - term map and pulsar - term map . with enough sensitivity over a range of frequencies it may even be possible to recover the distances to the pulsars from the response to the gw signal  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . if the distances to the pulsars are known , the timing residual @xmath57 yields the ml solution @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pseudo - inverse of @xmath5 , and @xmath60 is the pseudo inverse of @xmath61 , which is found by replacing the non - zero diagonal elements of @xmath61 by their reciprocal values . </S>",
    "<S> the ml solution for the sky basis amplitudes is given by @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for timing residuals dominated by zero mean gaussian noise , the pixels in the reconstructed sky maps follow a multi - variate gaussian distribution with @xmath63 or equivalently , @xmath64 with no summation on @xmath65 in the last expression . </S>",
    "<S> the noise in the reconstruction is dominated by sky maps with small singular values . in a bayesian analysis </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be avoided by using a trans - dimensional mcmc to select the sub - set of the sky basis vectors that optimally balances model fidelity against model complexity . in a frequentist analysis </S>",
    "<S> we can achieve a similar result by using a low - rank approximation to the pseudo - inverse , @xmath66 , which is found by replacing the largest diagonal elements of @xmath67 by zero . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction can be further improved by specifying suitable priors on the sky basis amplitudes . +     for a point source . </S>",
    "<S> the first column uses the full 36 earth - term sky basis vectors for the ipta , while the second column uses the 10 basis functions with the largest singular values . </S>",
    "<S> the first row is for the earth term contribution , while the second row includes pulsar and noise contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the whitened signal power was set equal to the whitened noise level . </S>",
    "<S> the white circles show the location of the point source , which is indicated by an arrow in the bottom left panel . ]    in the event that the pulsar distances can not be determined to sufficient accuracy , we can attempt to recover the earth - term sky . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we first break the timing residual out into the contribution from the earth - term , pulsar - term , and timing noise : @xmath68 in this case we treat the pulsar term as an additional noise source in the ml reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the earth - term ml solution is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the pseudo - inverse of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the ml solution for the earth term sky basis amplitudes is given by @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the noise in the reconstruction @xmath73 has contributions from the instrument noise and the pulsar term . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows full and reduced rank reconstructions of a point source . </S>",
    "<S> the full rank reconstruction with pulsar term and noise is badly corrupted , while the reduced rank reconstruction is not .    </S>",
    "<S> _ statistically isotropic signals _ since the sky template analysis is entirely general , it can be used in place of the standard cross - correlation analysis for isotropic stochastic signals . with a suitable </S>",
    "<S> parameterized prior on the amplitudes @xmath43 , defined below , the model shares the same dimensionality as the correlation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , the template based analysis offers the distinct computational advantage of avoiding the inversion of large correlation matrices when computing the likelihood .    </S>",
    "<S> a statistically isotropic stochastic signal is fully characterized by the expectation values for the sky - pixel amplitudes : @xmath74 the factor of one - half comes from averaging over the polarization angle . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulsars distances were known , we could work with the sky - basis vectors for the full response matrix and write @xmath75 from which it then follows that the timing residuals would be described by a multi - variate gaussian distribution with @xmath76 the expression for the cross correlation can be put in a more familiar form if we recall that what we really have in ( [ tstoc0 ] ) is @xmath77 . in the frequency domain , under the assumption that the noise in each pulsar is uncorrelated , the noise correlation matrix is diagonal : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the noise in the @xmath80 pulsar , and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> undoing the cholesky whitening we find @xmath82 where the correlation matrix @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> is closely related to the hellings - downs ( h&d ) correlation matrix  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it differs since here we are considering the ideal case where both the pulsar - term and the earth - term can be treated coherently . using ( [ mlf ] ) , it can be shown that the expectation values for the amplitudes of the ml sky basis vectors are given by @xmath84 equations ( [ tstoc0 ] ) and ( [ sfull ] ) contain the same information but package it differently . in terms of the timing correlations in ( [ tstoc0 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the gravitational wave signal and the instrument noise can be separated as they have different correlation matrices - the gravitational wave signal is correlated between pairs of pulsars while the noise is not . in terms of the amplitude correlations in ( [ sfull ] ) the gravitational wave signal and the instrument noise can be separated as they enter the different sky maps with different strengths .    more realistically , when the pulsar distances are not known to high accuracy we have to split the response into earth - term , pulsar - term and noise contributions which leads to a multi - variate gaussian distribution for the timing residuals : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the h&d  @xcite correlation matrix @xmath87 with @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the angle between the line of sight to pulsars @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the cross term @xmath91 vanishes since @xmath92 , which is a consequence of the pulsar - term sky maps oscillating rapidly across the sky and integrating to zero against the earth - term sky maps which are smooth functions . </S>",
    "<S> undoing the cholesky whitening and working in the frequency domain we get @xmath93 it is interesting to note that the scaled range vectors @xmath94 diagonalize the earth - term of the h&d correlation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the range vectors , which can be used to describe any gw signal , form the h&d correlation matrix explains why this quantity , which was originally derived for isotropic skies , is also relevant to point sources  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the sky basis maps for the earth - term and pulsar - term each have the correlation structure @xmath95 the earth - pulsar cross terms vanish . in a bayesian analysis </S>",
    "<S> the correlation structure ( [ searth ] ) serves as a prior on the @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> analytically marginalizing over the pulsar - term contribution adds a diagonal component to the noise correlation matrix proportional to @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> analytically marginalizing over the earth - term contribution results in the standard h&d correlation analysis . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can numerically marginalize over the earth - term gw templates @xmath97 , thereby avoiding the costly step of inverting a large correlation matrix when computing the likelihood . </S>",
    "<S> the templates can be generated in the fourier domain then transformed to the time domain and interpolated to match the un - even sampling of the data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> updates to the noise model parameters @xmath3 introduce a minor complication as they alter the cholesky whitening , which changes the sky basis vectors , singular values and range vectors . </S>",
    "<S> since the updated earth - term response matrix shares the same null space , column space and range as the original response matrix the new sky basis vectors and range vectors can be expressed as linear combinations of the original vectors , and the amplitudes of the sky basis amplitudes can be mapped to the new basis . </S>",
    "<S> the model dimension for the template based analysis matches that of the standard hellings - downs cross - correlation analysis , but could offer dramatic computational savings since the only matrices that need to be factorized or inverted are block diagonal .    _ anisotropic signals _ the sky template approach is ideally suited to studying anisotropic signals . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ mle ] ) provides a general maximum likelihood reconstruction of any signal , but this can be improved upon in a bayesian analysis that builds in priors on the sky - basis amplitudes . the key signature of an anisotropic signal is a non - diagonal ( though diagonal dominant ) correlation matrix @xmath98 . a variant of the isotropic search described above , but with a weaker prior on the correlation matrix , can be used to detect anisotropies in the nanohz gravitational wave sky . </S>"
