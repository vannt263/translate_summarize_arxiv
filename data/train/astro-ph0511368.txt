    "fundamental relationships between observed astrophysical quantities have been of tremendous value in advancing understanding .",
    "some examples are the h - r diagram for stars or the fundamental plane for early - type galaxies .",
    "recently , another such relationship has been advanced , the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite .",
    "these authors have considered both supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies as well as stellar mass black holes in the milky way .",
    "they sought and found a relationship between the radio luminosity ( l@xmath0 ) , x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) , and black hole mass ( m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the specific relationship found by merloni is logl@xmath0 = 0.60logl@xmath1 + 0.78logm@xmath2 .",
    "one of the problems with discovering such relationships is the nature of the sample .",
    "in particular , distance has often introduced a number of biases that need to be dealt with ( e.g. , the malmquist effect ) .",
    "many biases can be avoided by choosing volume - limited samples , such as clusters of stars or galaxies .",
    "however , agns and galactic black hole binaries are not clustered on small scales , so if a sample is to be constructed , one is forced to combine objects that have very different distances . when the range of the square in the distance becomes greater than the range in the fluxes ,",
    "the resulting luminosities are naturally stretched in luminosity - luminosity space , leading to an apparent correlation .",
    "the effect of distances or sample selection can obscure or modify the relationship that one seeks to uncover @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here shows that this distance problem may be partly or entirely responsible for the claimed fundamental plane of black hole activity and that such a relationship has not yet been uncovered .",
    "obtaining a spurious relationship is an effect that can occur when dealing with a flux - limited sample , provided that the multiplier ( i.e. , the square of the distance ) is large compared to the range of the fluxes .",
    "this spurious relationship will occur even if the fluxes are initially uncorrelated , so it can obscure a true relationship that may exist .",
    "the existing samples of black holes in papers discussing a fundamental plane have a variety of selection effects that lead them to having a flux - limited nature rather than complete volume - limited samples .",
    "the objects that made it into the samples are largely those that were detected in the radio and x - ray bands , with some estimate for the black hole mass , so most had to be detected and studied in the optical as well .",
    "most galaxies at 100 mpc ( a typical distance ) would not be detected to have nuclear point sources with a typical chandra observation .",
    "therefore , a detection will be usually within a couple of orders of magnitude of the detection threshold of the instrument .",
    "a similar situation exists in the radio band , although the detection rate of nuclear radio sources may be a bit higher with the vla .",
    "the more distant objects must be more luminous if they are to be detected , and although they are rarer , the search volume is substantially larger .",
    "most of the galactic supermassive black hole sources in the samples are at distances from 1 mpc to 1 gpc , so excluding the upper and lower 5% of objects on the distance scale , the remaining 90% of the sources have a distance range of 100 , and as this enters in the luminosity as distance squared , or a factor of 10@xmath3 .",
    "the 90% range in the x - ray and radio fluxes is about a factor of 3000 .",
    "the range in d@xmath4 is greater , but not vastly greater than the other ranges , yet it can lead to a spurious relationship or distort the nature of the true relationship .    to illustrate this , we take the sample of merloni , but scramble the radio fluxes so that they are randomly assigned to objects ( the x - ray flux , distance , and mass are not scrambled ) .",
    "we calculate new radio `` luminosities '' and find that plotting these objects fits the fundamental plane about as well as the original data ( figure 1 , 2 ) . without scrambling fluxes ,",
    "another test that one can perform is to consider the objects that have upper limits to their radio fluxes rather than detections ( this is a minority of objects ) . in this case , the fluxes contain almost no information about the objects , merely reflecting the rms of the instrument used . yet the resulting correlation has less scatter than the original fundamental plane relationship ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these two illustrations do not prove that a relationship does not exist between l@xmath1 , l@xmath0 , and m@xmath2 , but that one must be concerned as to whether this relationship has yet been found .",
    "the experience in astronomy is that within a class of objects , a source brighter in one waveband tends to be brighter in other wavebands as well .",
    "so the nominal expectation is a near - linear relationship between different luminosities .",
    "the effect of a range of distances stretches a sample along exactly the same relationship , making the two effects degenerate .",
    "below , we discuss one approach of overcoming this distance problem .",
    "there are distance - independent relationships that can be considered and that may provide important insights . for the subsample of supermassive black hole systems",
    ", we see that there is a relationship between l@xmath0/l@xmath1 and the black hole mass ( figure 4 ) . using the bisector linear fitting method for detected sources only @xcite",
    ", we find that l@xmath0/l@xmath1 @xmath5 m@xmath2@xmath6 , with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.44 for 78 degrees of freedom ; in fitting y - on - x , l@xmath0/l@xmath1 @xmath5 m@xmath2@xmath7 .",
    "although there is significant scatter , reflected in the low correlation coefficient , the relationship is significant at beyond the 99% confidence level .",
    "the upper and lower limits fall nearly equally on both sides of the regression line so the relationship still exists when such objects are taken into account .",
    "the implication of this result is that the radio luminosity rises more rapidly than the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , without a clear sample selection criteria , we can not be certain that this is not at least partly an artificial result .",
    "for example , some of the sources were originally discovered by radio studies ( e.g. , 3c390.3 in the 3c survey ) , which found radio - bright agns , often at considerable distances .",
    "the galactic hosts of these agns are usually optically luminous early - type galaxies , and as there is a relationship between optical luminosity and black hole mass , these are also systems of preferentially high m@xmath2 .",
    "consequently , this type of selection might bias the sample toward the highest l@xmath0 at large m@xmath2 .",
    "until the sample selection is better understood , we would not place too much significance on this relationship .",
    "for single sources , it is possible to determine the relationship between l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 , and this has been the basis of several programs .",
    "an impressive case is that of v404 cyg @xcite , where all the radio and x - ray luminosities are consistent with l@xmath0 @xmath5 l@xmath1@xmath8 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "other objects show much broader and more complicated variations between these luminosities , especially at high luminosities @xcite .    in order to study the relationship to black hole mass , along with l@xmath0 and l@xmath1",
    ", one needs a statistically sound sample of objects for which the range in d@xmath4 is less than l@xmath0 or l@xmath1 . for supermassive black holes",
    ", we suggest that the safest approach is to use a volume - limited sample of galaxies . in doing so",
    ", one might limit the galaxies by optical luminosity to exclude dwarf galaxies .",
    "the luminosities of interest are those from the black hole , so contaminating sources need to be avoided . in the x - ray band ,",
    "x - ray binaries are common in galaxies , but the resolution with the chandra observatory may be sufficient to exclude most binaries and obtain l@xmath1 from the black hole or an upper limit to l@xmath1 . ideally , the radio observations should be obtained at about the same time as the x - ray data and at sufficient spatial resolution to exclude extended emission .",
    "this would be an ambitious observing program in which many observations would result in upper limits .",
    "however , methods exist to include upper limits to the analysis .",
    "clearly , investigations should be carried out in the future to provide further insight into this important issue .",
    "the author would like to thank jon miller , david spergel , jimmy irwin , renato dupke , and eric feigelson for their comments and advice .",
    "jnb would like to acknowledge support from nasa under ltsa grant nag5 - 10765 .",
