    "for nonconservative dynamical systems the energy conservation law is broken and , as a consequence , the standard hamiltonian formalism is no longer valid for describing the behavior of the system . moreover , not only the energy , but also other physical quantities such as linear or angular momentums , are not conserved : noether s classical theorem ceases to be valid @xcite .    in order to model nonconservative dynamical systems , a novel approach to variational calculus was proposed by riewe in 1996 and 1997 , @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on the concept of fractional differentiation and fractional integration , @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the appearance of fractional equations is natural due to physical reasons of long - range dissipation , fractional wave propagation in complex media and long memory .",
