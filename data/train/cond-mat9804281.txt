    "conventional microelectronics is approaching a limit where further miniaturization is no longer possible .",
    "this has motivated a vigorous search for alternative technologies such as ` single electronics ' , which is based on coulomb charging effects in ultrasmall structures @xcite .",
    "a novel approach to building such structures  nature s own approach  is self - assembly using molecular recognition processes to form complex functional units .",
    "familiar examples of molecules with this ability are amphiphilic chain molecules ( e.g. thiol ) in solution which form ordered films on easily polarizable metal surfaces , antibodies which find and bind to specific molecular targets , and dna strands which recognize and bind to matching sequences .",
    "recent progress include the successful use of self - assembled dna templates for making tiny silver wires connecting macroscopic gold electrodes @xcite and the demonstration of room - temperature coulomb blockade behavior in novel composite mesoscopic structures containing both metallic elements and self - assembled organic matter @xcite .",
    "charging effects in the latter structures are in the focus of the work we present here .",
    "the crucial aspect of the new room - temperature coulomb blockade structures from the point of view of our work is that they contain metallic grains or molecular clusters with a typical size of 1 - 5 nm that can vibrate ; their positions are not necessarily fixed .",
    "this is because the dielectric material surrounding them is elastic and consists of mechanically soft organic molecules .",
    "these molecular inter - links have elastic moduli which are typically two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of ordinary solids @xcite .",
    "their ohmic resistance is high and of order @xmath0 - @xmath1 ohm , while at the same time they are extremely small  a few nanometers in size .",
    "a large coulomb blockade effect in combination with the softness of the dielectric medium implies that charge transfer may give rise to a significant deformation of these structures as they respond to the electric field associated with a bias voltage .",
    "hence the position of a grain with respect to , for instance , bulk metallic leads is not necessarily fixed .",
    "for the model system of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ]  containing one metallic cluster connected by molecular links to two metallic electrodes  we have recently shown @xcite that self - excitation of mechanical grain vibrations at 10 - 100 ghz accompanied by barrier deformations is possible for a sufficiently large bias voltage .",
    "this effect amounts to a novel ` shuttle mechanism ' for electron transport .",
    "the grain is accelerated by the same electrostatic force towards first one , then the other electrode .",
    "a cyclic change in direction is caused by the repeated `` loading '' of electrons near the negatively biased electrode and the subsequent `` unloading '' of the same at the positively biased electrode . as a result",

    "the analysis in our earlier work is valid for low tunnel - barrier resistances when the rate of charge redistribution between grain and leads , inversely proportional to the tunneling resistance , is assumed to be so large in comparison with the vibration frequency that the stochastic fluctuations in grain charge during a single vibration period are unimportant . in order to describe the opposite limit of low charge redistribution frequencies characteristic of high - resistance tunnel barriers",
    "we develop here a new approach for considering the coupling betwen charge fluctuations and grain vibrations .",
    "we show that in the case of weak electromechanical coupling ( i.e. when a change of the grain charge by @xmath2 does not significantly affect the vibrational motion ) the main results which can be obtained within the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite can be proven to be correct even for high resistance junctions . in this high ohmic limit",
    "a new scenario for the shuttle instability becomes possible leading to hysteresis in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our model composite coulomb blockade system as well as a derivation of the equations governing the charge transport through the system . then , in section 3 we derive the dynamical equations for the case when the ` fast ' grain oscillations have been averaged out so that only the ` slow ' variation in oscillation amplitude remains . in section 4",
    "these equations are used to analyze the shuttle instability and the resulting current - voltage characteristics in our model coulomb blockade system .",
    "the results are in good agreement with our earlier numerical results .",
    "the analytically solvable model is in addition useful for analyzing the nature of the loss of stability as the shuttle mechanism sets in .",
    "such an analysis  supplemented by monte carlo simulations  is carried out in section 5 , where we find that depending on the resistances of the tunnel junctions the transition from the static regime to the shuttle regime can be associated either with smooth increase in the amplitude of the self - oscillations or with a jump in the amplitude at the transition . adopting nomenclature from the theory of oscillations @xcite we are dealing with either soft or hard excitation of self - oscillations , where hard excitation is associated with a hysteretic behavior of the current as the bias voltage is swept up and down .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present a model of the simplest possible composite coulomb blockade system that retains the properties of interest for us .",
    "it consists of one small metallic grain of mass @xmath3 connected by elastic molecular links to two bulk leads on either side , as shown in fig .",
    "the electrostatic potential of the grain @xmath4 is a linear function of the grain charge @xmath5 and the bias voltage @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the displacement of the grain from the equilibrium position in the centre of the system .",
    "this relation defines the capacitance @xmath9 that appears in the theory . in a symmetric situation , as the one considered in this paper , @xmath10 and hence the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath11 are even and odd functions of @xmath8 respectively . for small displacements we have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath14 corresponds typically to the size of the grain .",
    "there are three different forces acting on the grain ; a linear elastic restoring force @xmath15 , a dissipative damping force @xmath16 and an electrostatic force @xmath17 , @xmath18 where the electrostatic energy @xmath19 of the system and the charges in the left ( right ) lead @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are considered to be functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is bilinear in @xmath5 and @xmath6 hence @xmath23 for a symmetric junction @xmath24 implying that @xmath25 is an odd function and that @xmath9 and @xmath26 are even .",
    "then , for small displacements , @xmath27 and one can consider @xmath28 as an effective electrostatic field induced by the bias voltage acting on the grain between the leads .",
    "this way we arrive at the estimate @xmath29_distance between the leads_.    knowing the forces that act on the grain , we may now introduce its equation of motion , @xmath30 if the coulomb charging energy , @xmath31 , satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the characteristic tunneling resistance and @xmath34 is the inverse temperature , one can expect a strong quantization of the charge @xmath35 in units of the elementary charge @xmath2 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 will be a step function which can take on only integer values .",
    "changes in @xmath37 with time are due to quantum transitions of electrons between the grain and the leads . according to the ` orthodox ' coulomb blockade theory @xcite the probability for the transition @xmath38 to occur during a small time interval @xmath39 when the grain is located at @xmath8",

    "resistances the variations in capacitance with position are relatively small and are therefore neglected . the equations ( [ e.eom])-([e.fdef ] ) hence define our model system .",
    "in this section we describe how the model system introduced above can be solved analytically for the case of weak electromechanical coupling . in later sections this analytical solution will be compared to ` exact ' monte - carlo results and found to be very useful in the further analysis of the model system .",
    "the key is to average over the fast grain oscillations so that we are left with a set of equations describing only the slow variations in the amplitude .",
    "we start by considering the typical scales of our parameters .",
    "it is natural to use @xmath46 as a characteristic length scale .",
    "furthermore the condition for observing coulomb blockade effects requires that we operate with voltages @xmath6 of the order of the coulomb blockade offset voltage @xmath48 . introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 the equation of motion for the grain ( [ e.eom ] ) turns into @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the elastic oscillation frequency and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined through @xmath55 and @xmath56 here",

    "there is a limit cycle in the position - charge plane for the grain ( shuttle ) motion as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.analstoch ] . above @xmath202",
    "the current - voltage curve has a step - like structure , a type of coulomb staircase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.iv ] even though we are modelling a symmetric double - junction system .",
    "the transition from the static regime , where the grain does not move , to the shuttle regime can either be associated with soft excitation of self - oscillations , i.e. a continuous square - root increase in oscillation amplitude above @xmath202 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.mcmildtrans ] or by hard excitation of self - oscillations ( the terminology is from the theory of oscillations @xcite ) implying a sudden jump in oscillation amplitude at an upper critical voltage @xmath203 . in the latter case",
    "the system behavior is hysteretic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.mchardtrans ] ; when the bias voltage is lowered the static regime is re - entered at a lower critical voltage @xmath204 .",
    "hard excitation of self - oscillation appears in our model for large junction resistances , @xmath205 . at the same time the numerical value of @xmath206 for large resistance junctions and may therefore be quite a bit larger than the threshold voltage @xmath144 for lifting the coulomb blockade .",
    "the current in the high - voltage shuttle regime may furthermore be distinctly larger than in the static low - voltage regime .",
    "this is because it is governed mainly by the elastic vibration frequency of the grain and not by the rate of charge tunneling from the grain at rest in the center of the system , equally far from both leads .",
    "hence in an experiment one might find a sudden increase of current at a quite large voltage @xmath202 , where the shuttle mechanism sets in , rather than at the lower threshold voltage @xmath144 , where the coulomb blockade is lifted .",
    "this observation may be relevant in connection with the recent experiment by braun _",
    "@xcite where hysteresis effects in the current - voltage curves and an anomalously large threshold voltage ( if interpreted within conventional coulomb blockade theory ) were reported for a system showing very large resistance at low bias voltages .",
    "the results of this work show that it may be possible to explain this experiment within a coulomb blockade theory which allows for a shuttle instability of the type described here . in order to establish whether this mechanism is truly responsible for the behaviour of the system in @xcite",
    "one has to study the experimental situation in great detail to properly estimate the mechanical parameters ( elastic vibration frequency and damping ) of the insulating material .",

    "in this appendix we derive the differential equation ( [ e.sh-eq3 ] ) for the quantity @xmath82 defined in ( [ e.pndef ] ) and the result ( [ e.ibareq ] ) for the average current @xmath207through the left and right leads .",
