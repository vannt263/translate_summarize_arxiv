    "the presence of quadratic divergences in loop corrections to the scalar higgs boson self - energy is responsible for the so - called hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) ; namely , there is no natural way of having a `` light '' mass ( i.e. @xmath0 gev ) for the higgs given that loop corrections induce contributions to the mass of the order of the gut scale or in general the high energy scale above which new physics enters and the sm ceases to be an effective theory . in supersymmetric extensions of the sm this problem is absent since the bosons are protected from quadratic divergences by their relation to supersymmetric ( fermion ) partners@xcite .",
    "the hierarchy problem is also absent in models in which the electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken , since the scalar particles are not fundamental but composite in those cases @xcite .",
    "recently a new kind of model was proposed which can solve the hierarchy problem of the scalar higgs boson . in these models ,",
    "called little higgs ( lh ) models @xcite , the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson and its mass is protected by a global symmetry and , unlike supersymmetry , quadratic divergence cancellations are due to contributions from new particles with the same spin .",
    "the phenomenology of these models has been discussed with respect to indirect effects on precision measurements @xcite and direct production of the new particles introduced @xcite .    since these early contributions ,",
    "several variations in the lh framework have been proposed @xcite . however , the cancellation of quadratic divergences is inherent to any lh model and this requires definite relations among certain couplings .",
    "therefore , any process that involves exclusively these couplings is a robust prediction of the lh mechanism regardless of model variations .    in this article",
    "we study a process that has ingrained in it the cancellation of quadratic divergences of top - quark loops , namely double higgs production . in section",
    "ii we review the model and the derivation of the masses and couplings of the relevant particles by appropriate diagonalization of mass matrices and show the cancellation of quadratic divergences directly in the broken symmetry phase . in section",
    "iii we derive the amplitudes for double higgs production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and compute the cross sections .",
    "our results are presented in section iv and we conclude in section v.",
    "there are many variations of little higgs models today , which differ in the symmetry groups and representations of the scalar multiplets , but they all have in common a mechanism of cancellation of the quadratic divergence for the mass of the lightest remaining scalars at one loop order .",
    "after the spontaneous breakdown of a global underlying symmetry at a scale @xmath1 ( supposedly not much higher than a few tev to avoid fine tuning ) , the model contains a large multiplet of pseudo - goldstone bosons , which includes the sm higgs doublet . while most members of the multiplet receive large masses ( again , of a few tev ) , the mass of the higgs boson is protected from quadratic divergences at one loop , and therefore remains naturally smaller .",
    "the cancellation is related to the existence of an extra ( heavier ) top - like quark and its interactions with the scalar sector , feature which is common to all lh models .",
    "consequently , a good test to distinguish a little higgs from other cases should be based on a signal sensitive to this particular feature of divergence cancellation and rather insensitive to other features .",
    "the higgs pair production at lhc is one of such signals , since it is based on exactly the same diagrams that enter the quadratic divergence cancellation ( fig .  1 ) , except for the insertion of two gluons ( fig .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "in order to work out the details , we make use of the littlest higgs model , which is a simple case but contains all the necessary ingredients . after spontaneous breakdown of the ( high - energy ) underlying symmetry , the little higgs lagrangian below the scale @xmath1 @xcite can be written as a non - linear sigma model based on a coset @xmath2 symmetry : @xmath3 where the subgroup @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] of @xmath5 is promoted to a local gauge symmetry .",
    "the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath6 to exhibit the interactions , one can expand @xmath7 in powers of @xmath8 around its vacuum expectation value @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the doublet that will remain light and @xmath12 is a triplet under the unbroken @xmath13 .",
    "the non - zero vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath14 leads to the breaking of the global @xmath5 symmetry to @xmath15 and also breaks the local gauge symmetry @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] into its diagonal subgroup , which is identified with the standard model @xmath16 symmetry group . following the notation of han _",
    "@xcite , we will denote the usual standard model gauge bosons mass eigenstates as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the subscript @xmath20 denotes light in order to distinguish from the heavy states with mass of order @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the standard model fermions acquire their masses via the usual yukawa interactions .",
    "however , in order to cancel the top quark quadratic contribution to the higgs self - energy , a new - vector like color triplet fermion pair , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with quantum numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 must be introduced .",
    "since they are vector - like , they are allowed to have a bare mass term which is _ chosen _ such as to cancel the quadratic divergence above scale @xmath21 .",
    "the coupling of the standard model top quark to the pseudo - goldstone bosons and the heavy colored fermions in the littlest higgs model is chosen to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are antisymmetric tensors .",
    "the new model parameters @xmath33 are supposed to be of the order    of unity .",
    "the linearized part of eq .  [ yuk ] describing the third generation mass terms and interactions with the neutral higgs field , denoted by @xmath34 , ( before spontaneous symmetry breaking , ssb ) , is given by : @xmath35 after ssb , we write @xmath36 , and follow perelstein _",
    "_ @xcite in defining left handed fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 and right handed fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 to obtain @xmath41    in order to leave the fermion mass term in its standard form we make the field redefinitions @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the left - handed fields resulting in the following lagrangian : @xmath44 diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath45 we obtain the usual result for the eigenvalues corresponding to the top quark @xmath46 and the heavy top @xmath47 which are , up to order @xmath48 : @xmath49 in our numerical code , we will use as input the values of @xmath50 and @xmath21 , from which one obtains the required values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 from equation ( [ lambdas ] ) , one clearly sees that there is a condition relating top masses and v.e.v.s that these models impose : @xmath54 and which we incorporate in our analysis .",
    "the relevant couplings between higgs and top quarks are obtained in a straightforward manner after diagonalization of eq .",
    "[ lag - mass ] and are given by ( the corresponding vertices are obtained via multiplication by @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 the relevant feynman diagrams for the higgs self - energy are shown in figure ( [ quadratic ] ) .",
    "the cancellation of tadpole diagrams requires that @xmath57 whereas the cancellation of higgs self - energy quadratic divergences implies @xmath58    these conditions are satisfied up to terms of order @xmath59 by the masses and couplings listed above.@xcite    in the simplest lh models , strict bounds on the parameters are obtained .",
    "in particular , electroweak precision constraints require @xmath60 tev @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent variation on the littlest higgs model , where a so - called t - parity that interchanges the two subgroups @xmath4_1 $ ] and @xmath4_2 $ ] of @xmath5 is introduced , can significantly lower this bound to @xmath61 gev @xcite .",
    "this is an important point for the phenomenology of these models , since a lower @xmath21 implies larger deviations from the sm . since the t - odd states do not participate in the cancellation of quadratic divergences ,",
    "our calculation is valid in models with t - parity as well .",
    "t - parity also forbids the generation of a vacuum expectation value for the triplet scalar field ( i.e. , @xmath62 in the notation of t.  han _",
    "et al._@xcite ) , which is one of the causes for easing the electroweak constraints .",
    "we now turn to higgs boson production at the lhc in the lh model , which involves the very same couplings responsible for the cancellation of quadratic divergences .",
    "gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant mechanism for sm higgs boson pair production at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath63 is dominated by top quark loops , in the form of triangle and box diagrams .",
    "[ triangles ] and [ boxes ] show the case for a lh model .",
    "the sm case is similar , except that fig .",
    "[ triangles].a and all extra heavy - top loops are absent .",
    "we also would like to point out that t - parity forbids a term like @xmath64 in the radiatively generated coleman - weinberg potential .",
