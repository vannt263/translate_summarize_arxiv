    "the flexibility of generating various lattice geometries and the controllability of the dimension , lattice parameters , and interaction parameters within the cold atomic setups make them ideal test beds for studying strongly correlated many - body phenomena . in condensed matter many - body systems , such as transition metal oxides and rare - earth materials , both spin and charge degrees of freedom play an important role determining their properties . for some materials ,",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom is also an vital factor .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom is active when the electronic orbitals are degenerate and partially filled with electrons .",
    "the strongly correlated nature and spatial anisotropy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbital electrons in some correlated materials are responsible for various exotic magnetic , superconducting , and transport properties",

    "condensed matter models can be engineered using atoms trapped in a combined harmonic and lattice potentials using various laser arrangements and other experimental laser techniques in cold atom setups .",
    "these so - called quantum simulators or atoms in optical lattices , not only provide better opportunities to explore existing condensed matter many - body phenomena , but also allow one to seek and explore new states of matter and their physical properties . unlike solid state electronic models , the optical lattice setups are rigid and robust . as a result ,",
    "the jahn - teller distortion and the conventional phonons are absent .",
    "however , these effects can be engineered using various laser techniques and different types of atoms at low temperatures .",
    "the electrons which are fermions are the constitute particles in condensed matter lattice models .",
    "however , not only fermions but also bosons , as well as mixture of fermions and bosons can be used as constitute particles in optical lattice models .",
    "opposed to the condensed matter systems , even @xmath0-orbital occupation of atoms in optical lattices can show strongly correlated many - body phenomena .",
    "recently , a tremendous experimental and theoretical progress has been achieved in the direction of understanding @xmath0-orbital bands of both fermions and bosons in optical lattices .",
    "fermions on a @xmath0-orbital band have been imaged and probed by transferring them into the @xmath0-orbital band using a sweep across the feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "as we consider in this letter , @xmath0-orbital bands can be activated even simpler way by completely filling the lowest @xmath3-orbital band with two pseudo - spin @xmath4 atoms and then having more than two atoms per site .",
    "the population of @xmath0-orbital band bosons were observed in moving lattice experiments  @xcite and dynamically deformed double - well lattices  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath3-orbital is completely filled and the @xmath3-orbital atom remains inert at the low energy subspace .",
    "the attractive interaction can be generated simply by adjusting the two - body scattering length to be negative values using feshbach resonance .",
    "we consider the system density at the half filling and strongly interacting limits . at the half filling density limit , on average , _ only _ one atom resides in a @xmath0-orbital at each site .",
    "first , we map the system hamiltonian into an effective spin hamiltonian .",
    "the fourth order tunneling process favored by the spatial anisotropy of the @xmath0-orbital orientation is taken into account using the fourth order in our perturbation theory .",
    "second , we map out the magnetic phase diagram of the effective spin hamiltonian using a variational mean field theory .",
    "third , we use a linear spin - wave theory to study the phase diagram and magnon excitation spectrum .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the effective model and discuss the details of mapping it into an effective spin - model . in section iii , we discuss our variational mean field approach and provide the resulting phase diagram of the effective spin - model . in section iv , we provide the details of our linear spin - wave theory for the effective spin - model and discuss the phase diagram and magnon excitation spectrum . in section",
    "v , we discuss the connection of the resulting phase diagram to the original model and experimental signatures of the magnetic phases . finally in section",
    "v , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider multi - orbital system of polarized fermions on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "we assume that the atoms are loaded to the lattice such that the @xmath3-orbital is completely filled and the dynamic of the system is determined only by the @xmath0-orbital atoms .",
    "further , we assume that only @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are active on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice .",
    "this scenario is reasonable as the @xmath3 and @xmath0-orbital bands are separated by a large band gap at experimentally relevant parameters and @xmath7 orbital has a higher energy in 2d configurations . by imposing a strong laser beam along the @xmath8-direction",

    "similarly , the hopping between @xmath6 orbitals along @xmath10-direction is greater than that of the @xmath9-direction . by representing the @xmath5 orbital occupation by pseudo - spin @xmath11 and @xmath6 orbital occupation by pseudo - spin @xmath12",
    ", the dynamics of the spin polarized atoms in pseudo - spin - dependent 2d optical lattice can be described by an effective hamiltonian ,    @xmath13    the first term is the kinetic energy and is proportional to the tunneling amplitude @xmath14 along the bond @xmath15 directions of @xmath16 atoms .",

    "all other nearest neighbor interactions , such as bond - charge , spin - spin , and pair - hopping are neglected .",
    "we consider the system at the half filling density , so that on average , only one atom resides at each lattice site occupying either @xmath5 or @xmath6 orbital .",
    "due to the directional dependence of @xmath0-orbitals , we take the tunneling amplitude of atoms @xmath14 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",

    "the local hilbert space has four states , namely empty site denoted by @xmath32 , singly occupied sites with up @xmath33 or down @xmath34 spins , and a doubly occupied site with opposite pseudo - spins @xmath35 .",
    "the energies of these states in unperturbed hamiltonian , i.e the on - site part of the hamiltonian , are given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note that our notations up and down spins represent the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbital occupation . at the half filling density limit where @xmath39 , the singly occupied sites have higher energies and the empty and double occupied sites energies are degenerate .",
    "the local hilbert space of two - neighboring sites has ten states , however six of those states that involve a single site have higher energies .",
    "therefore , the low - energy subspace constitutes only the four states , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with energies @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "the last term is originated from the fourth order tunneling process shown in fig .",
    "all other fourth order tunneling processes are much weaker for the present system .",

    ", the magnetic order in the xy plane corresponds to superfluid order , while the magnetic order in the z direction corresponds to density order .",
    "in this section , we use a variational mean field approach to study the phase diagram originating from the competition between three terms in the spin hamiltonian given in eq .",

    "<S> we examine a system of doubly degenerate @xmath0-orbital polarized fermions on a two - dimensional square lattice with a strong on - site interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the system density at the half filling limit and tackle the strong attractive interaction using a perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the four - site square plaquette interaction term generated from the directional tunneling dependence of @xmath0-orbitals using the fourth order in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we map the strong coupling particle hamiltonian into an effective spin - hamiltonian and then use a variational mean field approach and a linear spin - wave theory to study the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> further , we discuss the experimental signatures of these phases within the context of current cold - atom experimental techniques . </S>"
