    "collisions between heavy ions at low energy above the barrier are dominated by binary inelastic collisions @xcite . according to the prediction of the classical potential model of bass , applied to the fusion of heavy nuclei , the limiting value for fusion is given for projectile and target combinations",
    "whose product @xmath6 is not too large ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the attractive pocket in the internuclear potential still prevents , for angular momentums @xmath8 , the reseparation of the dinuclear system , allowing it to evolve towards a compact shape and fusion occurs leading to compound nuclei with @xmath9 .",
    "the experimental signature of fusion processes consists in the presence of evaporation residues and fission fragments in the exit channel . for increasing projectile mass , the critical angular momentum increases .",
    "it can reach values larger than the one at which the fission barrier of the compound nucleus vanishes @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the fusion cross section is expected to fall to a negligible fraction @xcite since the coulomb repulsion dominates and the potential well is not anymore able to trap the colliding nuclei and lead the system towards fusion .",
    "therefore , one expects , as main exit channels , very dissipatives collisions @xcite and , with a reduced probability , fusion followed by two fragments emission . in the dic the projectile and the target",
    "are strongly slowed down . during the formation of a dinuclear system and before the reseparation , nucleons may be exchanged .",
    "the process lifetime ( shorter than the compound nucleus formation one ) is deduced from the rotation angle of this system before decay and the dissipated energy is function of the rotation angle @xcite .    experimentally it was observed that the fission cross section was greater than the upper bound imposed by the presence of the minimum in the ion - ion potential @xcite .",
    "moreover the fission mass distributions were wider than what expected on the basis of the compound nucleus model @xcite .",
    "therefore , part of the cross section was ascribed to fusionlike processes characterized as `` fission without barrier '' which did not proceed through a compound formation .",
    "they are now referred to as quasi - fission @xcite .",
    "their interaction time is longer than the dic phenomenon @xcite .",
    "these capture reactions are practically indistinguishable from true compound fission and without the knowledge of the interaction times it is not possible to establish whether the two detected fragments were generated in a true fission process or in a fast - fission one .",
    "moreover studies on the fusion - evaporation cross section for near symmetric systems @xcite provided evidence for the dynamical suppression of complete fusion even if the suppression may in some cases be due to a reduced detection efficiency .",
    "the concept of an `` extra - push '' in the interaction , conceived by swiatecki , @xcite was necessary to allow the achievement of complete fusion .",
    "it was introduced in the interaction in form of one - body dissipation and experimentally consists in a shift of the effective mean fusion barrier causing fusion hindrance in heavy systems at energies around the barrier .",
    "dynamical fusion theories based on different approaches @xcite were able to reproduce data for fusion cross sections for reactions between nuclei nearly symmetric with medium heavy masses ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a recent model @xcite gives the probability of compound nucleus formation as composed by the probability of formation in overcoming the ion - ion barrier all together to the probability of diffusion toward a spherical shape from the dinuclear initial stage .    for incident energies at 10 or more mev / nucleon above the barrier ,",
    "the appearance of pre - equilibrium nucleon emission gives rise to incomplete fusion processes leading to formation of compound nuclei with @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , since for higher beam energies more energy is converted into excitation energy , events with three or four fragments in the exit channel may constitue an important fraction of the associated cross section .",
    "indra @xcite has been used to perform a large body of measurements of the @xmath12 system over a wide range of energies .",
    "this gave an unique opportunity for an important and exclusive study of reaction mechanisms for such a heavy quasi - symmetric system .",
    "+ previous works on data acquired with indra and concerning the same system at around and above fermi energies @xcite focused mostly on the multifragmentation of a composite system formed in central collisions . in this paper",
    "we study the energy range from just above the barrier ( @xmath2 a.mev ) to the fermi energy domain ( @xmath3 a.mev ) .",
    "first , total reaction cross - sections are determined as a function of incident energy and compared with existing systematics .",
    "then we present a new method to estimate the total cross - section for both complete or incomplete fusion and capture reactions leading to fast or quasifission .",
    "the resulting excitation function is compared with the recent systematics of @xcite .",
    "the present study concerns the analysis of the data recorded during the @xmath13 indra campaign for reactions induced by @xmath0 projectiles on self - supporting 350 @xmath14 thick @xmath1 targets at different beam energies e / a = 8 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 25 , 27 , 29 and 35 a.mev .",
    "the experiment was performed at ganil facility ( caen , france ) .",
    "since the coupling of two main cyclotrons ( css1 and css2 ) did not allow to explore the whole incident energy range , the @xmath0 beam was first accelerated at 27 a.mev and successively degraded , through carbon foils of different thickness , to the energies of interest .",
    "the charge state of the primary beam was 40 + .",
    "after the degrader , as expected , the xe beam had a wide distribution of charge states .",
    "therefore , with the help of the @xmath15-spectrometer , only one charge state was selected .",
    "the b@xmath16 setting of the spectrometer was optimized for each incident energy . however at low energy",
    "more than one charge state was transmitted and this affected the incident energy with uncertainties around @xmath17 mev for the beam energies at 8 and 12 a.mev .",
    "the energies at e / a = 29 and 35 a.mev were obtained by direct tuning .",
    "+ indra is a charged particle multidetector covering @xmath18 of the total solid angle .",
    "it is composed by 336 independent telescopes arranged in 17 rings centered on the beam axis . in the first ring ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 )",
    "are arranged 12 telescopes composed of a 300 @xmath21 m silicon wafer and a csi(tl ) scintillator crystal ( 14 cm thick )",
    ". rings 2 to 9 ( @xmath20 to @xmath22 ) have 12 or 24 three - stage detection telescopes : a gas - ionization chamber ( filled with @xmath23 ) , a 300 or a 150 @xmath21 m silicon wafer and a csi(tl ) scintillator ( 14 to 10 cm thick ) coupled to a photomultiplier tube .",
    "rings 10 to 17 ( @xmath22 to @xmath24 ) are comprised of 24 , 16 or 8 two - member telescopes : a gas - ionization chamber and a csi(tl ) scintillator of 8 , 6 or 5 cm thick .",
    "a more detailed description may be found in references @xcite .",
    "+    .[cin ] kinematic characteristics for the @xmath12 system at different incident energies .",
    "the laboratory velocity @xmath25 and the center mass velocity @xmath26 are in @xmath27 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]            the fusion cross sections computed with the selections above exposed are shown in table [ fusion ] .",
    "the error bars were evaluated by computing the cross section value corresponding to different selections on the heaviest charge for higher beam energies . for lower energies it was useful to study the set composed by events without any fragment and compute the cross section values with and without this set . +",
    "no correction for efficiency has still been applied : this could influence the cross section results especially for low bombarding energies , were the compound formation may travel directly in the very forward direction without being detected .",
    "however , in the meanwhile , this effect should be more dramatic as the beam energy increases since all the products are more focalised in the forward direction .",
    "+ the fusion cross section values of table [ fusion ] are shown in figure [ fuscross ] . in the upper panel",
    "these values show a maximum at 15 a.mev .",
    "one expects that for the beam energies of 8 and 12 a.mev the values of the cross sections are higher .",
    "even if for 8 a.mev the fusion hindrance , above discussed , would diminish the fusion probability , the detector acceptance is suspected to be responsible for the loss of fusion / incomplete fusion events since all the residues with a forward angle lower than @xmath20 were lost . for",
    "increasing energies the probability for fusion events decreases rapidly : at higher energies the transparency effets of the nuclear matter dominate as it was observed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "because of its high kinetic energy the incident nucleus can not anylonger succeed in forming a compound nucleus with the target and both are broken in several fragments during the collision .",
    "+ the lower panel of figure [ fuscross ] shows the cross section values normalized to the shen @xcite values of the total reaction cross section previously discussed in order to compare them to those obtained for our system as described in the work accomplished by p. eudes and collegues in the references @xcite which displays a systematic study on a large body of fusion data in order to deduce a universal behavior . the different systems were organized depending on their size taking into account the mass asymmetry and data were plotted in function of the available energy defined as : @xmath28 the authors deduced an homographic function starting from the ratio of the fusion cross section to the reaction cross section . in the present work the red curve with star symbols in figure [ fuscross ] is the homographic function calculated for the @xmath12 system using the parameters given in reference @xcite . + as one can see from figure [ fuscross ] , the cross sections values are in fairly good agreement with the function from eudes _",
    "et al._. although the homographic function in reference @xcite was deduced for light to intermediate systems and then extrapolated to heavy systems it seems to work fairly well also for this heavy system . on the red curve one can see the expected values for 8 and 12 a.mev .",
    "these two lowest bombarding energies are the closest to the barrier and it would be important to understand if their cross section are hindered because of the lower incident energy .",
    "a first preliminary insight came recently @xcite . a first simplified simulation based on the two step model @xcite applied to the system at 8 and 12 a.mev beam energies ( for @xmath29 ) gave fusion cross sections in agreement with the experimental ones above reported . the question is still studied in order to take in account correctly the angular momentum .",
    "in this work the energy dependence of the experimental reaction cross section was displayed and compared to different parameterizations .",
    "data were found in fair agreement with those which take into account the effects due to the neutron skin and to the pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "then we turned to the fusion cross section evaluation for which candidates for fusion events were selected with the help of the @xmath30 observable .",
    "it is the first time that such a study is accomplished , for a wide energy range from 8 to 35 a.mev , on the quasi - symmetric heavy system @xmath5 .",
    "the excitation function obtained shows a maximum around 15 a.mev and then falls to lower values at increasing energies .",
    "values of the same order can be found in literature for mass intermediate systems and for lower bombarding energies @xcite or light systems at comparable energies @xcite and references there in .    for heavy colliding nuclei the compound sytem formed decays by fission which becomes the favorite exit channel depending on the fissility of the compound system @xmath31 .",
    "since in the diabatic hindrance model starting from a fusibility parameter @xmath32 @xcite fusion becomes a dynamically hindered process , for @xmath5 with @xmath33 , fission and quasi - fission are clearly in competition .    as we discussed and showed , our method of computing the fusion cross section succeeds in excluding the dic component .",
    "it is clear that for this system there is a quasi - fission component .",
    "as already discussed , this process is slower than the dic and does not proceed through the compound nucleus formation .",
    "to quantify it one should determine the characteristic decay times from angular distributions or solve isotopically the detected fragments @xcite .",
    "this was beyond our purpose which was merely to supply a fusion upper bound for this system in particular , scaling with the beam energies .",
    "however in a future fazia @xcite could be able to detect the fragments with a good isotopic resolution and so could be able to disentangle the different fusion - like mechanisms .",
    "+ the fusion cross sections of table [ fusion ] were compared to a theoretical curve expected to give an universal behavior .",
    "for all the energies but the lower ones ( 8 and 12 a.mev ) it was found a nice agreement with the universal behavior found by eudes et al .",
    "+ more data on quasi - symmetric and heavy systems would help to support the results of the present study .",
    "+ the selection with the @xmath30 observable revealed powerful in separating the different contributions for central , semiperipheral and peripheral events . in particular the sample of semiperipheral collisions show few characteristics reminding deep inelastic collisions as it was displayed in the text .",
    "as already quoted , the evident discrepancy from the general trend for lower energies ( 8 and 12 a.mev ) could be ascribed to the intrinsic difficulty ( the second inner fusion barrier needing an extra - push energy to be overcame ) for heavy elements to form a true compound nucleus .",
    "the acceptance of indra at very low angles ( lower than @xmath20 ) complicates the analysis because of the loss of those residues ejected in the very forward direction and only slightly deviated by the light particle evaporation process . to better understand and clarify this point simulations with a montecarlo code",
    "are needed .",
    "in particular , simulations with the code hipse @xcite and gemini @xcite are currently in progress in order to better understand both the role of indra acceptance and of fusion hindrance .",
