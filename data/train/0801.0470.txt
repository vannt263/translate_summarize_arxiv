    "thus , one should carry out the replacements :    @xmath64 . in the following ,",
    "we mainly discuss the rashba soi effect on the transport properties since the intrinsic soi is very small , while the rashba soi can be tunable by a perpendicular electric field . in figs . 1 and 2 , we show the chemical potential @xmath65 dependence of the longitudinal conductivity for the different rashba spin orbit parameter @xmath17 at zero or nonzero field . for zero field ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , one can see that when @xmath66 , the conductivity is    proportional to @xmath67 and tends to the known quantum - limited minimal value @xmath68 at zero chemical potential@xcite . for @xmath69 , there exists a threshold chemical potential @xmath70 which increases with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "when the chemical potential is smaller than @xmath70 , the longitudinal conductivity becomes almost independent of @xmath65 ; while for @xmath71 , the @xmath72-@xmath65 curves recover the linear relation .",
    "this tendency agrees with eq .",
    "( [ sigxxlm ] ) . for nonzero field case in fig .",
    "2 , we observe sdh oscillations of the conductivity due to the landau - level crossing of the fermi level@xcite . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clearly seen that when @xmath69 , each oscillation peak is split into two implicit peaks , and the splitting peaks shift by @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to the spin - orbit splitting of the landau levels .    the longitudinal conductivity as a function of the magnetic field b for the different @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the longitudinal conductivity decreases and intervals between the neighboring sdh oscillation peaks become large with increasing b , which reflects the fact that in the presence of the magnetic field only the transitions between neighboring landau levels contribute to electrical conductivity , while a further increase of the magnetic field leads to increasing of the distance between neighboring landau level , thus suppresses the transitions between them . when @xmath73 is large enough",
    ", the conductivity becomes independent of @xmath73 since the lowest landau level is filled which is always below the fermi level .",
    "these observations are quite consistent with the previous studies@xcite@xcite . in particular , it is interesting to note that when the rashba soi presents , the longitudinal conductivity exhibits the characteristic feature that the sdh oscillations are enhanced largely at certain positions , however damped at other positions .",
    "such sdh as a beating pattern have been observed in two dimensional electron gas@xcite . from fig .",
    "3 , one can find that the enhanced positions and amplitudes of the sdh oscillations can be tuned by the rashba soi due to shift of one set of landau level by @xmath17 .",
    "figure 4 shows the longitudinal conductivity versus the rashba soi parameter @xmath17 for the different magnetic field @xmath73 .",
    "it is found that when the magnetic field is applied , the longitudinal conductivity as a function of @xmath17 behaves as the oscillation .",
    "it is because the rashba soi leads to the shift of landau level , the longitudinal conductivity shows a maximum each time a landau level passes through the fermi level of system , and a minimum when the fermi level is situated between two landau levels .",
    "figure 5 shows hall conductivity as a function of the chemical potential @xmath65 for the different @xmath17 . when @xmath66 , the hall conductivity has a steplike structure as a function of @xmath65 , which reflect the quantum hall effect .",
    "while the rashba soi opens , the hall steps become narrow and the step near @xmath74 is split into two steps .",
    "it is observed that the hall conductivity displays peaks instead of a plateau at larger @xmath17 .",
    "there is no hall plateau in the cases of sufficiently strong rashba soi .",
    "this result suggests that the rashba soi tends to suppress the quantum hall effect in graphene .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the sois on transport of dirac fermions in graphene on the basis of amplitude estimation of yao _ et al_. and min _",
    "et al_. for the sois . using the schwinger proper - time method , decomposition over landau level poles and kubo formula ,",
    "we obtain the analytical expressions for both longitudinal and hall conductivities .",
    "it has been found that when the rashba soi is applied , the longitudinal conductivity versus the chemical potential deviates the linear relation at zero magnetic field .",
    "for nonzero magnetic field , the sdh oscillation in the longitudinal conductivity is observed , and each sdh oscillation peak is split into two peaks as the rashba soi is applied . while the oscillation in the longitudinal conductivity as a function of the magnetic field exhibits a beating pattern with the rashba soi turned on .",
