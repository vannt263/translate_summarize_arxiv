    "vacuum magnetic birefringence is a non linear electrodynamic effect in vacuum closely related to light - by - light elastic scattering .",
    "predicted by the euler - heisenberg - weisskopf effective lagrangian density @xcite written in 1936 ,    @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it takes into account the vacuum fluctuations of electron - positron pairs . as of today , @xmath1 still needs experimental confirmation .",
    "here @xmath2 the ellipticity @xmath3 induced on a linearly polarised beam of light with wavelength @xmath4 passing through a medium with birefringence @xmath5 and length @xmath6 , and whose axes are defined by the external magnetic field , is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angle between the magnetic field and the polarisation direction .",
    "the birefringence predicted by @xmath1 is @xcite @xmath9    several experiments are underway , of which the most sensitive at present are based on polarimeters with very high finesse fabry - perot cavities and variable magnetic fields .",
    "the fabry - perot cavity is necessary to increase the optical path @xmath6 within the magnetic field region , whereas the variable magnetic field is necessary to induce a time dependent effect .",
    "both of these aspects significantly increase the sensitivity of the polarimeters .",
    "high field static superconducting magnets such as those used in the lhc and hera accelerators have also been proposed but their use is limited by the difficulty in modulating , in one way or another , their magnetic fields . to work around this problem , proposals of rotating the polarisation have been considered @xcite , but the presence of the fabry - perot cavity , whose mirrors always present an intrinsic birefringence whose induced ellipticity is orders of magnitude larger than the ellipticity due to vacuum magnetic birefringence , have made this idea unfeasible .    in this note",
    ", a novel modulation scheme is presented that might profitably be employed with large superconding magnets .",
    "in a recent workshop in hamburg @xcite , a new scheme , presented in this paper , has been suggested to measure the magnetic birefringence of vacuum predicted on the basis of the 1936 effective lagrangian @xmath1 .",
    "the hera - x experiment @xcite proposes to make use of the powerful infrastructure of the set - up @xcite : about 5000  t@xmath10 m , which could go up to about 7700  t@xmath10 m if the peak field of 6.6  t is employed .",
    "the magnetic birefringence in hera - x will therefore be @xmath11 for the 5.3  t magnetic field . with this birefringence ,",
    "the maximum ellipticity @xmath12 is @xmath13 for @xmath14  nm and @xmath15  m. in the usual setups , the magnetic field is modulated to gain sensitivity . in the particular case of the hera superconducting magnets the electric current in can be modulated at about a millihertz frequency @xcite .",
    "let s analyse the measurement scheme of figure [ heterodyne ] , featuring two crossed polarisers , a variable magnetic field ( fixed direction ) at a frequency @xmath16 , and an ellipticity modulator at a frequency @xmath17 for linearising the effect . in this scheme",
    "the intensity collected at the photodiode pde is , at the lowest useful order , @xmath18 + \\mathcal{o}\\left[\\psi(t)^2\\right].\\ ] ] the interesting signal is found , in a fourier transform of the signal from the photodiode , at the two sidebands @xmath19 from the carrier frequency @xmath17 of the ellipticity modulator .",
    "the resulting peak shot - noise sensitivity in such a scheme is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron charge , @xmath22 is the intensity reaching the analyser , and @xmath23 is the quantum efficiency of the photodiode . with @xmath24  mw and @xmath25  a / w ,",
    "the shot - noise peak sensitivity is @xmath26 . despite the exceptional parameters of the magnetic field of hera - x , the integration time @xmath27 to achieve a unitary signal - to - noise ratio",
    "remains too long , even supposing to work at shot - noise sensitivity : @xmath28 as mentioned above , further amplification is required .",
    "this can be achieved with a fabry - perot cavity , which can be thought of as a lengthening of the optical path by a factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the finesse of the cavity .",
    "the proposed finesse for hera - x is @xmath31 .",
    "with such a finesse , the ellipticity @xmath3 increases by a factor @xmath32 and the integration time therefore diminishes by a factor @xmath33 . assuming shot - noise sensitivity , on paper , this device should easily allow the measurement .",
    "a problem remains , however , regarding the actual sensitivity that one may reasonably think to achieve at low frequencies with such a long cavity .",
    "let us consider the experiments on this subject realised so far with a scheme similar to the one proposed with hera - x @xcite . in figure [ noise ]",
    "we show the noise densities in birefringence @xmath34 measured in these apparatuses as a function of the frequency of the effect . in this formula",
    "@xmath35 is the ellipticity sensitivity of each experiment , @xmath4 is the wavelength , @xmath30 is the finesse and @xmath36 the cavity length . note that the cavity length @xmath36 has been used instead of the length @xmath6 of the magnetic region ; what is plotted is therefore the _ best _ sensitivity in birefringence that _ could _ be obtained by the experiments . in the figure",
    "we did not report a much higher sensitivity value of the q  @xmath37  @xmath38a experiment .",
    "the data are fitted with a power function .",
    "the message put forward by figure [ noise ] is that increasing the effective length ( finesse and magnetic field length ) does not guarantee the shortening of the necessary integration time to reach a unitary signal - to - noise ratio ; seeking the highest finesse possible is not necessarily the optimal choice .",
    "increasing the birefringence modulation frequency seems to be more effective .",
    "furthermore , with lower finesses , the cavity will have a shorter decay time and therefore a higher cutoff frequency allowing higher modulation frequencies .",
    "figure [ noise ] suggests , therefore , that the finesse of the cavity should be the highest for which the polarimeter is still limited by intrinsic noises .",
    "the figure suggests that it is unlikely that , at 1  mhz , a sensitivity better than @xmath39 can be reached . as a matter of fact , the sensitivity of a giant 200  m cavity , necessarily built with the end mirrors sitting on separate benches , can hardly be predicted .",
    "even assuming for hera - x the sensitivity of figure [ noise ] at 1  mhz , a snr  =  1 could only be reached in about @xmath40",
    "in this note , we present a novel modulation scheme that would bring in several advantages .",
    "this idea has never been tested in a laboratory , but is likely to be more effective than the one described above . in this way",
    "one can work at higher frequencies for the best sensitivity . in this scheme the magnetic field",
    "does not need to be modulated .",
    "the scheme consists in introducing a pair of co - rotating half - wave - plates @xmath41 and @xmath42 _ inside the fabry - perot cavity _ , as schematically shown in figure [ scheme ] .",
    "the polarisation within the magnetic field would rotate at twice the frequency of the wave - plates and should allow to increase substantially the modulation frequency of the effect .",
    "an important feature of this scheme is that the polarisation direction of the light on the fabry - perot mirrors would remain fixed , thereby eliminating the contribution of the ellipticity due to the intrinsic birefringence of the mirrors .",
    "furthermore , the polarisation direction on each mirror could be chosen ; the input polariser defines the polarisation direction on the first mirror whereas on the second mirror the polarisation direction is defined by the relative angle between the axes of the two wave - plates .",
    ": rotating half - wave - plates .",
    "pde : extinction photodiode ; pdt : transmission photodiode.,width=321 ]    let us indicate with @xmath43 the rotation frequency of the wave - plates , that we suppose to rotate synchronously but not necessarily aligned one to the other .",
    "the jones representation of the electric field at the exit of the cavity is    @xmath44^n\\cdot\\\\ & & te^{i\\delta/2}\\,\\mathbf{l}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}_1\\cdot\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right)=\\\\ & = & e_0\\,\\left[\\mathbf{i}-re^{i\\delta}\\,\\mathbf{l}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}_1 ^ 2\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}_2\\right]^{-1}\\cdot\\\\ & & te^{i\\delta/2}\\,\\mathbf{l}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{l}_1\\cdot\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the round - trip phase acquired by the light between the two cavity mirrors , @xmath46 and @xmath27 are the reflectivity and transmissivity of the mirrors , @xmath47 is the identity matrix , @xmath48 is the magnetic birefringence of vacuum generating an ellipticity @xmath3 in the polarisation of the light , and @xmath49 are the rotating wave - plates . here",
    "@xmath50 represents the wave - plate and @xmath51 the rotation matrix , with @xmath8 the variable azimuthal angle of the wave - plates : @xmath52 .",
    "the angle @xmath53 is the constant relative phase between the slow axes of the two rotating wave - plates , and @xmath54 allow for small deviations from @xmath55 of the retardation of the two imperfect wave - plates .",
    "the electric field after the analyser is then @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the ellipticity modulator , placed at @xmath58 with respect to the output polarisation , and the analyser set to maximum extinction , respectively . in the expression for @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the rotation matrix between the cavity and the ellipticity modulator ensures that the modulator and the analyser are correctly oriented .",
    "to first order in @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath3 , the intensity detected by the photodiode pde is given by @xmath63\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an interesting result from this formula is that the signal of the magnetic birefringence of vacuum is found at the frequencies @xmath64 deriving from the product @xmath65 , while the signals due to imperfect wave - plates come at @xmath66 . in the above formulas we have not considered the intrinsic birefringence of the mirrors @xcite . in this scheme , by choosing appropriately @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 it should be possible to minimise the effect of this birefringence by independently aligning , on each mirror , the polarisation of the light to the birefringence axes of the mirrors @xcite .    clearly",
    "the presence of the two half - wave - plates inside the cavity introduces some losses .",
    "therefore there is an upper limit to the finesse one can obtain due to the absorption of the wave - plates . with a correct antireflective coating , wave - plates can be obtained with a total absorption of @xmath69% each .",
    "considering that the finesse @xmath30 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and assuming that the transmission of the mirrors @xmath27 are such that @xmath72 ( four passages through the waveplates ) , the absorption of the wave - plates limits the finesse to @xmath73    in this case the predicted qed ellipticity signal would be @xmath74 assuming for hera - x the best birefringence sensitivity as shown in figure [ noise ] , this would mean a value of @xmath75 @ 100  hz ( with @xmath76  hz ) . and a corresponding sensitivity in ellipticity @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding integration time to reach @xmath78 would therefore be @xmath79 such a sensitivity remains to be demonstrated in the exceptional conditions of the proposed hera - x experiment , but with such a low finesse , near shot - noise ellipticity sensitivities have been demonstrated . furthermore very long fabry - perot cavities have been shown to be stable at frequencies of a few tens of hertz by ligo and virgo reaching shot - noise performances @xcite .",
    "the numbers seem to be within reach and we believe that this scheme could be a viable solution when using high field static magnetic fields generated by superconducting magnets .",
    "in this note we have proposed a new scheme for a sensitive polarimeter dedicated to measuring vacuum magnetic birefringence based on a fabry - perot cavity which would allow the use of static magnetic fields generated by superconducting magnets .",
    "the modulation of the birefringence , necessary to reach high sensitivities , is performed by two co - rotating half - wave - plates _ inside _ the cavity , thus satisfying two conditions : rotating polarisation of the light inside the magnetic field ; fixed polarisation direction on the fabry - perot mirrors .",
    "furthermore the polarisation direction on the two mirrors can be controlled independently .",
