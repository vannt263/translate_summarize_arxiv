    "a fundamental thermodynamic quantity is the amount of energy that can be extracted from non - equilibrium systems .",
    "the field of quantum thermodynamics @xcite is currently experiencing a considerable effort to understand the concepts of work and heat within quantum mechanics@xcite . while work is commonly analyzed in the presence of external coherent control on the system @xcite , heat is associated to energy changes that are due to some system - bath interaction @xcite .",
    "quantum thermodynamics tackles heat transfer by modelling the system - bath interactions as a quantum mechanical process mathematically described , under weak - coupling assumptions , by the lindblad generator @xcite .",
    "scenarios featuring consecutive interactions between individual elements of a quantum multipartite system and their own local environments have recently been investigated @xcite and the study of these correlated channels has made clear that interesting new features emerge in the presence of correlations .    given the quantum mechanical nature of such processes , an interesting question is if , and how , the heat flux between a multipartite system and its reservoir can be affected by intra - system _ quantum _ correlations ( qcs ) which are present in the initial state .",
    "in particular , one can investigate whether qcs , either in the form of entanglement @xcite or quantum discord  @xcite , are fundamental resources for the heat transfer mechanism . note that a similar issue was tackled in the completely different framework of quantum biology , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to predict that , if the various subsystems are not directly coupled and the reservoir is sufficiently large to prevent any cross - talking , then correlations do not play any role . in such cases , the heat flux emerging from a composite system",
    "is the same for all the initial states admitting the same local representation , regardless of the presence of correlations among its constituents .",
    "the scenario however changes drastically if we do introduce interactions among the various subsystems or if the reservoir  sees \" the compound systems as a unique object ( so called common bath ) .",
    "for instance , it is well known that a strong coupling between two atoms can inhibit energy dissipation via the formation of dark states effectively decoupled from the reservoir  @xcite . in all these cases , quantum coherence ( at the level of either initial correlations or interactions )",
    "plays a major role .    in this paper",
    ", we shed light on such issues in the case of a cascade bipartite system where energy flows between its subsystems along a specific direction ( say from subsystem 1 to subsystem 2 but not the opposite ) .",
    "although thermal equilibrium with the heat bath is always reached after an infinite amount of time , a stronger or weaker heat flux can be obtained by engineering correlations in the initial state of the system , giving rise to very different timescales for the thermalization process .",
    "this means that the same amount of energy , stored into different configurations of the system , can be retrieved faster or slower according to the chosen state preparation . in our study , we adopt the master equation approach developed by gardiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the case of bosonic baths and recently generalized by two of us  @xcite via a collision - model - based approach . within this framework",
    ", we discuss both the case of continuos - variable systems ( two quantum harmonic oscillators ) and the case of two - level systems ( a pair of qubits @xcite ) showing how the presence of initial correlations can influence the system dynamics by speeding up or slowing down the energy flux to or from the reservoir .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that in both scenarios , while entanglement among the subsystems appears not to play an essential role , the extremal performances in terms of heat flux rate take place in the presence of high values of non - classical correlations  @xcite in the initial state of the system . yet , strong quantum correlations are not sufficient to ensure faster or slower energy transfer .",
    "this is particularly true in the continuous - variable case where states featuring the maximum level of non - classicality do not show any difference in terms oh heat fluxes with respect to the completely uncorrelated case . while our analysis is of a conceptual nature ( the systems under study being rather idealized ) the effects we describe may find potential applications in designing more efficient energy storage units or energy filters .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ secsys ]",
    ", we describe the model under consideration and the master equation describing its open dynamics under a cascade interaction with the reservoir . in section [ heat - fluxes ]",
    ", we investigate the general form of the total and local heat fluxes and show that the former can be decomposed into three contributions , one of which reflects the interaction between the subsystems mediated by the reservoir . in section [ time_heat_fluxes ] , we address the general time dependance of heat fluxes for both harmonic oscillators and qubits . in section [ ho ] ,",
    "( case of harmonic oscillators ) and [ subseccorrheat ] ( qubits ) we analyze extensively the heat flux dynamics when the initial state of the open system is thermal or correlated ( but locally thermal ) .",
    "we furthermore investigate on the role of initial qcs . in section vii",
    ", we show that in some cases the correlated heat flux can be directly connected to a discord - like measure of qcs .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] , we draw our conclusions .",

    "details on both measures can be found in appendix [ appe ] .",
    "figures 5 shows density plots of logarithmic negativity ( a ) and gaussian discord ( b ) on the @xmath190 plane for @xmath144 and @xmath128 ( i.e. , the paradigmatic instance addressed in the previous subsection ) .",

    "the steepest - increase directions are given by @xmath195 ( where also @xmath191 increases ) and @xmath146 ( where instead entanglement is fully absent ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection ( see also appendix [ appd ] ) , for any possible choice of @xmath196 there is a class of equivalent states ( identified by @xmath197 ) which exhibit the same heat flux dynamics [ cf .",

    "the connection with energy release appears even weaker for entanglement as witnessed by the fact that , for each entangled state , there is always a separable one yielding the same heat flux dynamics [ see figure 4(b ) ] .",

    "pure_. in other words , @xmath1 has the same temperature as @xmath3 but features non - zero coherences . in such a case",
    ", we can show that @xmath253 is in general finite but @xmath254 identically .",
    "in other words , the interaction mediated by the reservoir gives rise to qcs between the system s subparts with no simultaneous development of any correlated heat flux .",
    "in this work , we have studied the dynamics of heat flux of a bipartite system interacting with a thermal reservoir in a cascaded way .",
    "the cascading makes one of the two subsystems interact with the reservoir modified by the previous interaction with the other subsystem .",
    "because of such circumstance , the local dynamics of the second subsystem is non - markovian despite the fact that the joint dynamics is markovian .",
    "this affects the heat flux in such a way that it exhibits a non - exponential time behaviour .",
    "we have carried out a systematic analysis of this after showing that the total heat flux can be decomposed into three components . in particular ,",
    "one of these  arising from a non - local dissipator entering the master equation  can be identified as a correlated heat flux and was shown to play a major role in the non - monotonic time evolution .",
    "typical behaviours , occurring in the case of both thermal and correlated initial states , have been scrutinized for two paradigmatic systems : a pair of harmonic oscillators with a reservoir of bosonic modes and two qubits with a reservoir of fermionic modes . while in the case of harmonic oscillators",
    "basically all of the observed features can be explained analytically , an analogous analysis is not possible for qubits .",
    "notwithstanding , most of the qualitative features of the heat flux dynamics are quite similar to those occurring for harmonic oscillators ( aside from saturation effects owing to the presence of only two levels for qubits ) .    in the case of thermal initial states , we have shown that the total heat flux exhibits a monotonic , although non - exponential , time behaviour .",
    "in particular , an almost flat profile arises at intermediate times which is mostly due to the occurrence of the aforementioned correlated heat flux . to explore the effect of initial correlations in the system state , we have focused on a suitable family of initial states that are locally thermal but additionally feature non - local correlations . in general ,",
    "the effect of these is to cause non - monotonicity of the total heat flux accompanied by a simultaneous slow down or speed up of the thermalisation process .",
    "we have investigated the role played by the initial amount of quantum correlations , either in the form of entanglement or discord , on the rate of energy exchange .",
    "our analysis indicates that , although the states featuring the slowest and fastest heat flux dynamics are characterized by high values of discord , it is mostly the peculiar _ structure _ of initial correlations that matters rather than their overall amount .",
    "finally , we have found that  in the case of qubits and for initial thermal states  the magnitude of the correlated heat flux at any time coincides ( up to a proportionality factor ) with the trace distance discord of the open system . in particular , this shows the existence of a physical scenario within which such a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations acquires a clear physical significance .",
    "it is worth to emphasise that , as already observed , a key feature of our system is that while the joint dynamics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is markovian , the reduced dynamics of system @xmath2 is non - markovian .",
    "recently , the concept of quantum non - markovianity has received remarkable attention @xcite in the effort of defining on a rigorous basis the distinctive aspects of such phenomenon and , accordingly , ways to quantify it @xcite . within this framework , our work suggests an interesting connection between quantum non - markovianity and heat flux dynamics .    in this work ,",
    "we have focused on initial states  either correlated or not  that are in any case locally thermal at a _ uniform _ temperature ( i.e. , the same for both subsystems ) .",
    "allowing for a non - uniform temperature makes the heat flux dynamics as well as its interplay with initial correlations considerably richer , which will be the subject of a future work @xcite .",
