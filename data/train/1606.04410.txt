    "braneworld scenarios driven by extra dimensions @xcite have been identified through several strategies involving analytical procedures . in these scenarios ,",
    "the observable universe is supported by a hypersurface with @xmath0 dimensions , the brane , inserted in a bulk with @xmath1 dimensions , where @xmath2 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "paradigmatically , the extra dimension can be very large or even infinitely extended , and thereat particles and fields are supposed to be constrained by the brane properties , whereas gravity can evade as to permeate the entire bulk .",
    "matter localization is possible due to a warp factor parameter driving the metric that folds the brane through an approach that can explain , for instance , the hierarchy properties @xcite beyond the standard model .",
    "despite its challenging proposal , the search for beyond the standard model solutions of descriptions of the universe has become an arduous task .",
    "the brane scenarios considered here , and their matter localization profiles exhibited in some cases , are related to generic solutions of an effective action driven by a real scalar field , @xmath3 , coupled to @xmath4-dimensional gravity , given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature , @xmath7 denotes the metric tensor , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 running from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and which gives rise to several strategies for investigating analytical braneworld scenarios .",
    "real scalar field theories coupled to gravity produce thick domain walls often related to integrable models through which analytical solutions of gravitating defect structures admit an internal structure . in this case , potentials driven by a single real scalar field support bps - like solutions @xcite of first - order differential equations that allow for generating braneworld scenarios through the insertion of deformed topological defects @xcite . in one - dimensional scalar field theories resumed by a scalar field @xmath12 ( from eq .",

    "deformed potentials exhibiting either a single or multiple minima engender two types of defects with different topologies . when it has at least two degenerate minima , it generates two new vacua corresponding to the classical field configurations , @xmath21 .",
    "in one spatial dimension the space boundaries consist in two critical points of the potential , i. e. those located at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this spatial boundary topology is mirrored by the vacua configuration space topology of the fields , which also consists in two points , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , when the potential has one single minimum , @xmath26 , it leads to @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , a trivial map carries both boundary spatial points in the same field value ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) , which defines lump - like structures .",
    "likewise , for degenerate minima , the identity map carries @xmath22 into @xmath24 and @xmath23 into @xmath25 , which defines kink - like structures .    in order to guarantee the model integrability as well as matter localization , several lump - like defects can be obtained from deformation chains ( as those from refs .",
