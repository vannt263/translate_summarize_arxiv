    "the structure of hadrons in the infrared is a challenging topic . at low resolution scales ( i .. e . , large distances @xmath11 ) both , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , are crucial phenomena .",
    "they influence mass and angular momentum generation of hadrons .",
    "these phenomena are of primary interest both theoretically and experimentally . to understand physics at these deeply nonperturbative scales one",
    "needs direct information about the chiral and the angular momentum content of hadrons .",
    "such information can be obtained from dynamical lattice simulations . using a set of interpolators that form a complete basis with respect to the @xmath12 transformations ,",
    "one is able to define in a gauge invariant manner and measure the chiral content of mesons at different resolution scales @xcite .",
    "one basically measures a ratio of couplings of different interpolators to a given hadron .",
    "such a ratio tells us something about chiral symmetry breaking in a hadron wave function .",
    "if chiral symmetry were unbroken in a hadron , then only interpolators with definite chiral transformation properties would couple to this hadron .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in a hadron would imply that interpolators with different chiral transformation properties would create this hadron from the vacuum .",
    "the output of the two - flavor dynamical simulations with @xmath13 mev @xcite was that at the resolution scales @xmath14 fm the @xmath1 meson is approximately a 55% - 45% mixture of the two possible chiral representations @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "given a unitary transformation from the quark - antiquark chiral basis to the @xmath17 basis in the rest frame @xcite , we were able to extract the angular momentum content of the @xmath1 meson in the rest frame @xcite .",
    "the result was that the @xmath1 meson at the scales @xmath14 fm is approximately a @xmath9 state with a tiny contribution of a @xmath10 wave . in this definition of total angular momentum ( in the rest frame )",
    "there is no `` spin crisis '' , at least for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this definition of the spin content of a hadron is very different from the traditional one .",
    "the latter relies on the parton distributions in the infinite momentum frame extracted from the deep inelastic scattering with polarization @xcite .",
    "accordingly only about 30% spin of the nucleon is carried by the spins of valence quarks @xcite , which gave rise to the term  spin crisis \" .",
    "similar results within this same definition are obtained on the lattice both for the nucleon and mesons , for a review and references see @xcite .",
    "then a natural question is which of these two definitions does reflect the spin content of a hadron ?    in @xcite we have also measured the chiral and angular momentum content of the first excitation of the @xmath1 meson , @xmath18 . as compared to the ground state @xmath1 , we have observed a very different dependence of the chiral and angular momentum content on the resolution scale .",
    "in particular , we have found weaker chiral symmetry breaking in the @xmath2 state with the @xmath16 representation being the leading one in the infrared . we have also found a significant contribution of the @xmath10 wave in the @xmath2 wave function .",
    "this means that the @xmath2 can not be considered as a pure radial excitation of the @xmath1 meson .    in these studies",
    "only two different resolution scales were used .",
    "this did not allow to reliably extrapolate the results up to the resolution scale of the excited hadron size , @xmath19 fm .",
    "in the present paper we extend our correlation matrix from @xmath20 to @xmath21 by providing three different gaussian smearings of the quark fields in the vector and tensor interpolators .",
    "this allows us to discuss the chiral symmetry and angular momentum content of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in the infrared region of 1 fm , where mass is generated .",
    "in this paper we study the chiral and angular contents of the @xmath1-mesons , consequently we restrict our discussions specifically to the @xmath22 states .",
    "but the formalism is generic and can be used for mesons with other quantum numbers as well .",
    "a chiral classification of some interpolators is performed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a full classification of the quark - antiquark states as well as of the corresponding interpolators is done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of the @xmath22 states",
    "there are two allowed chiral representations , @xmath23 and @xmath16 .",
    "the state that transforms as @xmath15 can be created from the vacuum by the vector current , @xmath24 and the state that belongs to the @xmath16 representation can be created by the pseudotensor operator , @xmath25 the chiral partner of the first operator is the axial vector current , @xmath26 that creates from the vacuum the @xmath27 states , @xmath28 .",
    "the chiral partner of the second operator is the operator @xmath29 that couples to the @xmath30 @xmath31 mesons .",
    "it is well established in quenched @xcite and dynamical @xcite lattice simulations that the ground and excited states of the @xmath1 meson can be created from the vacuum by both the vector and pseudotensor operators .",
    "this fact by itself means that chiral symmetry is broken in the vacuum and in the physical states , and these states are mixtures of these two representations @xcite .",
    "the chiral basis in the quark - antiquark system is a complete one and can be connected to the complete angular momentum basis in the rest frame via the unitary transformation @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 consequently , if we know the mixture of the two allowed chiral representations in a physical state , we are also able to obtain the angular momentum content of this state in the rest frame .",
    "in particular , we can answer a question whether or not a spin of a meson is carried by spins of its valence quarks in the rest frame .",
    "this definition of the spin content is different from the traditional one that relies on the parton distributions in the infinite momentum frame . according to the latter only about 30% of the nucleon spin",
    "is carried by the valence quarks , which has been referred to as  spin crisis \" .",
    "hence we can compare a spin content of a meson obtained according to our definition with the spin content extracted from the parton distributions in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "in order to resolve a few subsequent physical states with the same quantum numbers one has to choose a convenient set of operators @xmath34 with the same quantum numbers and a significant overlap with the physical states , and calculate a cross - correlation matrix at zero spatial momentum ( i.e. , in the rest frame ) @xcite , @xmath35 with the coefficients giving the overlap of the operators with the physical state , @xmath36    with a set of operators spanning a complete and orthogonal basis with respect to some symmetry group , these overlaps ( coupling constants ) give the complete information about symmetry breaking .",
    "the interpolating composite operators @xmath34 are not normalized on the lattice and consequently the absolute values of the coupling constants @xmath37 can not be obtained . however , a ratio of the couplings is a well defined quantity and can be computed as @xcite @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the cross - correlation matrix from ( [ corr_inf ] ) , a sum is implied for the index @xmath40 on the right - hand side and @xmath41 are the eigenvectors obtained from the generalized eigenvalue problem , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being some normalization point in euclidean time .    in our calculation",
    "a set of interpolators @xmath34 complete with respect to @xmath0 and the angular momentum basis consists of the vector ( [ rv ] ) and pseudotensor ( [ rt ] ) operators .",
    "however , there is an infinite amount of nonlocal operators with the same chiral and angular momentum structure like ( [ rv ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) but with different radial spatial form .",
    "we want to construct these nonlocal operators in such a way that each of them would probe the hadron structure at a given physical resolution scale .    in the continuum",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are given as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vector meson state with the mass @xmath46 , momentum @xmath47 and polarization @xmath48 .",
    "the vector current is conserved , consequently the vector coupling constant @xmath49 is scale - independent .",
    "the pseudotensor `` current '' is not conserved and is subject to a nonzero anomalous dimension .",
    "consequently the pseudotensor coupling @xmath50 manifestly depends on the scale @xmath51 . in the rest frame",
    "the ratio @xmath52 coincides with the ratio of matrix elements ( [ ratio_op_comp ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "we want to probe the hadron structure at infrared scales , where mass is generated .",
    "the hadron interpolators that create and annihilate the hadrons are built from quark fields . with the local lattice interpolators of type @xmath54 we study the hadron structure at the scale given by the lattice spacing @xmath55 .",
    "given a reasonably small value of @xmath55 we can fix a smaller resolution ( larger size ) of our probe by a gauge invariant smearing of the quark fields in the interpolator .",
    "namely , we smear the quark fields in the source and sink in spatial directions with a gaussian profile of the size @xmath56 . technically this gaussian type of smearing is achieved by jacobi smearing @xcite . for examples of the resulting quark profiles",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of the cross correlation matrix then give us information on the contribution of the various interpolators ( with different dirac structure and built from differently smeared quark sources ) to the physical state .",
    "then , even in the continuum limit @xmath57 we may probe the hadron structure at a scale fixed by @xmath56 .",
    "such a definition of the resolution is similar to the experimental one , where an external probe is sensitive only to the quark fields ( it is blind to gluonic fields ) at a resolution that is determined by the typical momentum transfer in spatial directions .",
    ".[tab : sim ] specification of the data used here ; for the gauge coupling only the leading value @xmath58 is given , @xmath59 denotes the bare mass parameter of the ci action .",

    "the lattice size is @xmath61 .",
    "we use dynamical gauge configurations with two mass - degenerate light quarks . with the lattice spacing @xmath62",
    "fm the spatial volume of the lattice is @xmath63 @xmath64 . for the ground states and some their first excitations such a volume turns out to be sufficient to get approximately correct masses of hadrons in the physical limit @xcite , though it is certainly too small to consider higher excitations . in our present study we limit ourselves to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states . for details on the simulation",
    "we refer the reader to the table [ tab : sim ] and to @xcite .",
    "we use three different smearing radii @xmath56 for the quark fields in the source and sink , see table [ tab : radii ] .",
    "narrow \" smearing width ( index @xmath65 ) varies between 0.33 and 0.36 fm , depending on the set of configurations .",
    "the  wide \" smearing radius ( index @xmath66 ) lies between 0.66 and 0.69 fm and the  ultrawide \" one is 0.81  0.85 fm ( index @xmath67 ) .",
    "hence we can study the hadron structure at resolutions 0.33 fm  0.85 fm and will be able to extrapolate the results up a resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "we have the following set of operators : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is one of the spatial dirac matrices and @xmath70 is the @xmath71-matrix in ( euclidean ) time direction . for the sets",
    "a and c we construct @xmath20 correlation matrices ( i.e. , with both vector and pseudotensor interpolators using narrow and wide smearing radii ) , while for the sets b1 and b2 we study the @xmath21 correlation matrix ( with narrow , wide and ultrawide smearings for both vector and pseudotensor operators ) as well as different possible @xmath20 sub - matrices .    for the parameters of the simulation",
    "the @xmath1 mass is below the p wave decay energy . as has been discussed in @xcite no coupling to the @xmath72 channel",
    "is observed , which may be due to the fact that no meson - meson interpolator has been explicitly included in the set .",
    "we thus may identify the second lowest observed energy level with the @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the masses of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , extracted from different sets and correlation matrices , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "a ratio of the vector to the pseudotensor couplings versus a resolution scale @xmath56 , as extracted from all @xmath20 and @xmath21 correlation matrices .",
    "broken lines are drawn only to guide the eye.,height=302 ]    a measure of chiral symmetry breaking in @xmath1 and @xmath2 states at some resolution @xmath56 is given by the ratio @xmath73 , which is the same as the ratio ( [ rhov / rhot ] ) , obtained at a given resolution scale . at @xmath74 ( i.e. , at @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) this ratio is divergent , because the pseudotensor operator decouples from the physical state in the asymptotic freedom regime .",
    "this can be understood in two ways . in the asymptotic freedom regime chiral symmetry",
    "is not broken , hence only one of the two interpolators ( which have different chiral transformation properties ) can couple to the state .",
    "the vector current is conserved and the constants @xmath77 are scale - independent .",
    "the pseudotensor `` current '' is not conserved and in the asymptotic freedom regime its coupling approaches zero @xcite .",
    "indeed , in our previous study @xcite we did observe this behavior for the @xmath1 meson towards the ultraviolet regime .",
    "however , the way how this ratio approaches the ultraviolet regime for different physical states is a priori unknown and explicitly depends on the hadron wave functions .",
    "the results for this ratio for both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states obtained from different @xmath20 and @xmath21 correlation matrices are consistent with each other .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 from both sets of correlation matrices .",
    "a complete set of operators would include all possible smearing radii @xmath56 and the correlation matrix would be of infinite dimension . given the consistency of the results fror @xmath20 and @xmath21 we can deduce reliable physical information already from the present results .",
    "in particular , we clearly see that the ratio for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons approaches the ultraviolet regime in a very different manner . for the @xmath2 state the pseudotensor operator",
    "decouples much faster towards the ultraviolet than for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this demonstrates that the wave functions of these two states are significantly different .",
    "since the ratio reflects a degree of chiral symmetry breaking at different scales , this symmetry breaking is very different for both states .    the ratio @xmath73 , which is a ratio of two possible chiral representations in a hadron wave function , also defines an angular momentum decomposition of a state via the unitary transformation ( [ unitary_1 ] ) , ( [ unitary_2 ] ) . in particular , in the asymptotic freedom regime , where only the @xmath78 representation couples , the angular momentum content of @xmath1 mesons is fixed to be @xmath79 .",
    "deviation from this superposition of the @xmath80- and @xmath81-waves in a state towards the infrared regime is due to chiral symmetry breaking in this state . from fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] we clearly see that the ratio is very different for both states at all possible scales .",
    "hence chiral symmetry breaking as well as the angular momentum generation are also very different for both states .",
    "this difference shows that the @xmath2 state can not be considered as simply a radial excitation of the @xmath1 meson , since the latter would require that their angular momentum content is the same at different resolutions .",
    "existing data at the resolutions @xmath82 fm allows us to extrapolate results up to a resolution of 1 fm .",
    "a tentative extrapolation with uncertainties is represented by a shadowed area on fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] . given that the physical size of the @xmath1 state is of the order @xmath83 fm , as could be deduced from the experimental charge radii of the nucleon and @xmath1-meson , and for the excited @xmath2 meson it should be of the order of 1 fm , we can deduce chiral symmetry breaking and the angular momentum content of both states at the infrared scales of their size .",
    "for the ground state @xmath1 meson this ratio is within @xmath84 while for its first excitation this ratio @xmath85 .",
    "chiral symmetry is almost maximally broken ( i.e. , close to 1 ) in the ground state @xmath1 , while a degree of chiral symmetry breaking in the @xmath2 state is essentially smaller , which is consistent with effective chiral restoration in highly excited hadrons @xcite . in the ground state",
    "@xmath1 the slightly leading representation is @xmath78 , while in the excited @xmath2 state a leading chiral representation is @xmath16 .    given these ratios , we can obtain the angular momentum contents of both mesons from ( [ unitary_1 ] ) , ( [ unitary_2 ] ) . for the @xmath1 meson it is approximately @xmath86 .",
    "hence the ground state in the infrared is practically a pure @xmath9 state with a tiny admixture of the @xmath10 wave .    in contrast , in the excited @xmath1 meson there is a sizeable contribution of the @xmath10 wave . in the latter case",
    "the angular momentum content is between the following two lower and upper bound values .",
    "for the lower bound it is @xmath87 and for the upper bound it is @xmath88 .",
    "this once again demonstrates that the first excitation of the @xmath1 meson can not be considered as a pure radial excitation of the ground state @xmath1",
    ". obviously , both radial and orbital degrees of freedom are excited which reflects yet unknown dynamics of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the fact that the angular momentum content of the @xmath1 meson is given by the @xmath9 state means that according to a definition used in our study there is no  spin crisis \" .",
    "the spin of the @xmath1 meson in the rest frame is carried by spins of its valence quarks dressed by gluons .",
    "the gluonic field is important for the angular momentum generation , because it is this field that provides chiral symmetry breaking and is responsible for most of the hadron mass .",
    "however , it is not clear to us whether it is possible to separate contributions of quarks and gluons in the highly non perturbative , confining regime .",
    "we summarize the most important implications of our study .",
    "it is possible to define and measure a degree of chiral symmetry breaking in mesons at different resolution scales .",
    "we are able to define and measure in a gauge invariant manner the angular momentum content of mesons in the rest frame .",
    "the angular momentum content of hadrons is deeply connected with chiral symmetry breaking in hadrons .",
    "chiral symmetry is strongly broken in the @xmath1 meson and its wave function ( bethe - salpeter amplitude ) is approximately a 55% - 45% mixture of the chiral representations @xmath78 and @xmath16 . the angular momentum content of the @xmath1 meson is almost completely represented by the @xmath9 partial wave at resolution scales of @xmath89 fm .",
    "according to our definition of the spin content , the spin of the @xmath1 meson is carried by its valence quarks .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in the excited @xmath2 meson is weaker and the leading chiral representation in this case is @xmath16 .",
    "there is a significant contribution of the @xmath10 wave in the @xmath2 wave function and consequently the @xmath2 meson can not be considered as a radial excitation of the @xmath1 .",
