    "recent progress in the fabrication of nanostructures for photonics applications has stimulated research into light trapping and guiding on the subwavelength scale @xcite .",
    "surface plasmon polaritons tightly confined to the metal - dielectric interfaces have been at the focus of recent efforts in this direction @xcite .",
    "the research into plasmons has included studies of their interaction with periodically structured metals , see , e.g. @xcite , which have been recently extended to soliton structures in periodic arrays of metalic slot waveguides filled with a nonlinear dielectric @xcite .",
    "the latter work has been a significant and conceptual departure from research into optical solitons in nonlinear waveguides arrays coupled by evanescent waves @xcite .",
    "the metal dielectric interfaces in @xcite are separated by distances much smaller than the wavelength , so that the concept of the coupling induced by the evanescent waves @xcite becomes largely irrelevant .",
    "new effects can be expected in this regime , which are still waiting to be explored .",
    "semiconductors also can be used for subwavelength guiding . in particular ,",
    "silicon photonic wires have been recently promoted as promising and close to practical applications building blocks of photonic chips , where nonlinear and soliton effects have been already extensively researched @xcite .",
    "the large refractive index of silicon ( @xmath2 ) allows for tight light confinement by the conventional total internal reflection mechanism , giving the simultaneous advantages of strong ultrafast kerr nonlinearity ( @xmath3m@xmath4/w ) , controlled dispersion and manageable losses .",
    "losses are a particular problem for plasmons , suggesting that their nonlinear functionality is likely to become more viable if gain is introduced into the dielectric @xcite .",
    "two photon and free career induced absorptions are traditionally thought of as hampering the attractiveness of silicon for nonlinear applications , but these often can be lived with @xcite or managed , e.g. by the electrically removing free carriers from the waveguide core @xcite .",
    "there are also other highly nonlinear semiconductors and glasses which can be useful for various on - chip applications .",
    "in particular , many of the soliton experiments in planar waveguide arrays have been performed using doped gaas ( @xmath5 , @xmath6m@xmath4/w ) structures @xcite .    while an isolated silicon or gaas photonic wire confines light within an area of the order of the wavelength inside the material squared ( @xmath7 ) , bringing two wires together with a separation of few tens of nanometers produces a strong intensity peak _ in - between the wires _ , with the field predominantly polarised perpendicular to the interface between the wires ( tm - modes ) .",
    "this type of waveguides is called slot waveguides and they provide an elegant method of focusing light into a subwavelength region @xcite .",
    "one can ask a question about the existence of solitary waves having subwavelength dimensions in arrays of the semiconductor - dielectric slot waveguides .",
    "the losses in such arrays are expected to be few db / cm @xcite .",
    "measurements of the transverse profile of the slot mode have been reported in @xcite , while applications of the silicon slot waveguides have been demonstrated for frequency conversion and wavelength division multiplexing @xcite , as well as for the design of high q resonators @xcite and sensors based upon them @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider an infinite array of semiconductor photonic wires with the wire widths and separations taken well below the wavelength .",
    "we assume that the photon energy is below the bandgap and the semiconductor acts essentially as a high index nonlinear dielectric .",
    "we present analysis of linear and soliton solutions for both te and tm polarizations using first principle maxwell equations .",
    "the te solitons undergo a smooth transformation from the case , which can be well understood in terms of the evanescently coupled waveguides into the solitons of a quasi - homogeneous medium , when the widths of all layers become much less than the wavelength .",
    "conversely and centrally to our work , the tm solitons , under the same change of geometry , evolve into structures with the dominant intensity peaks located outside the semiconductor , i.e. in the low index material .",
    "these peaks become the prevailing features as the separation of high index semiconductor waveguides is reduced .",
    "thus the tm solitons are not transformed into the solitons of the quasi - homogeneous medium , which does not distinguish between polarizations .",
    "our analysis strongly suggests that for subwavelength separations , the tm solitons can be qualitatively considered as discrete solitons composed of the coupled modes of the slot waveguides .",
    "we also propose and apply a technique to study linear stability of solitons within the framework of the linearised maxwell equations .",
    "the array of slot waveguides we consider below is a periodic structure of narrow layers of a high index semiconductor material ( material @xmath8 , e.g. , silicon ) embedded into a low index dielectric material ( material @xmath9 , e.g. , silica glass ) , see ref . @xcite and fig .",

    "this signals transition to the regime when a periodic nanostructure can be considered as an array of coupled slot waveguides for tm waves , rather than an array of coupled high index waveguides guiding by means of total internal reflection . reducing the interface separation",
    "further one enters the regime where the diffraction law in a periodic nanostructure becomes similar to the diffraction in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the te solitons in this quasihomogeneous limit feel little or no periodicity .",
    "however , the transverse profiles of the tm solitons reflect the subwavelength periodic structure and have dominant intensity peaks inside the low index slots . in this regime the tm solitons with the center of symmetry in the middle of a low index slot are stable while the ones centered on a high index layer are unstable .",
    "this further facilitates the idea that the tm waves in periodic nanostructures can be considered as modes of the coupled slot waveguides and calls for developing of the corresponding analytic approaches .",
