    "galaxies show a striking color bimodality in the color - magnitude and the color - stellar mass ( color - mass , hereafter ) diagrams , both locally , based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( kauffmann et al . 2003b ; baldry et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) , and at high redshift ( bell et al . 2004",
    "; faber et al . 2007 ; ilbert et al .",
    "2010 ) . since the discovery of the bimodality ,",
    "several evolutionary pathways have been proposed for how the blue cloud of star - forming galaxies evolves to the red sequence of quiescent galaxies through the transition phase of the so - called green valley ( e.g. bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "2007 ; marchesini et al . 2014 ; schawinski et al . 2014 ) .",
    "there is also a tight correlation between the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the stellar mass for normal star - forming galaxies , which is referred to as the `` main sequence '' ( ms ) and changes with redshift in its normalization out to redshift 6 ( e.g. brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ; noeske et al . 2007 ;",
    "leitner 2012 ; magdis et al .",
    "2010 ; bouwens et al . 2012 ; salmon et al . 2015 ) .",
    "meanwhile , starburst galaxies are located above the ms and are likely driven by gas - rich major mergers ( rodighiero et al .",
    "2011 ; hung et al .",
    "2013 ) .    furthermore , based on co observations for galaxies at both low and high redshifts , daddi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and genzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented evidence for the bimodal behavior of star formation processes .",
    "disk galaxies and starburst galaxies , triggered by gas - rich major mergers , occupy distinct regions in the sfr and gas mass diagrams .",
    "they suggested two star formation modes : a long - lasting star formation mode where the gas reservoir is consumed slowly for disk galaxies , and a rapid star formation mode for starburst galaxies which have high star formation efficiencies ( @xmath8 10 times higher than those of disk galaxies ) due to their much higher dense gas fractions ( gao & solomon 2004 ) .",
    "it is likely that there exists a close link between the two star formation modes and the different evolutionary pathways .    in recent years",
    ", there are many works investigating the bimodality of galaxies in the color - magnitude diagram , particularly on how the blue cloud star - forming galaxies are quenched and evolve to the red sequence ( quiescent ) galaxies with a broad stellar mass distribution .",
    "this is especially the case for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies . from the results of deep2 and combo-17 surveys on the luminosity functions of blue and red galaxies to redshift 1 , faber et al .",
    "( 2007 ) first proposed a mixed scenario for the formation of massive red quiescent galaxies .",
    "they suggested that after star formation in the blue cloud galaxies is quenched , these galaxies leave the blue cloud and migrate to the red sequence , then they evolve slowly along the red sequence through a series of dry mergers to form local massive red sequence galaxies . on the other hand , observations of high - redshift galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 ; kriek et al .",
    "2009 ) found that massive quiescent galaxies are substantially more compact than local galaxies with similar stellar masses .",
    "galaxies with intense and concentrated starbursts , triggered by gas - rich major mergers , are possible progenitors of massive compact quiescent galaxies ( wellons et al .",
    "2015 ) . actually , barro et al . (",
    "2013 ) detected compact star - forming galaxies ( csfgs ) at redshift 1.4 - 3 by combining high resolution hst / wfc3 images and multi - wavelength photometry of massive galaxies ( @xmath9 ) in goods - s and uds fields of the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) . from the number densities , sizes , sfrs and dynamical properties of csfgs",
    ", they are likely the progenitors of high - redshift compact quiescent massive galaxies ( cqgs , see also barro et al .",
    "2014a , 2014b ) .",
    "then , barro et al . ( 2013 ) proposed two evolutionary tracks to form quiescent galaxies : the csfgs formed by gas - rich processes are quenched rapidly and fade to compact massive early - type galaxies , subsequent minor dry mergers can puff up quiescent early - type galaxies over time and grow in the quiescent phase ; on the other hand , larger sfgs evolve slowly and become extended early - type galaxies directly .",
    "more and more pieces of evidence support this two evolutionary pathway scenario , especially the fast track for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies",
    ". marchesini et al .",
    "( 2014 ) searched for the progenitors of local ultra - massive galaxies with @xmath10 based on ultra vista catalogs ( muzzin et al .",
    "2013b ) and concluded that the progenitors of red sequence massive galaxies are red , massive and heavily dust - extincted starburst galaxies and have never been on the blue cloud since redshift 3 .",
    "it implies that the most massive galaxies formed early and quickly , which has been confirmed by mancini et al .",
    "( 2015 ) based on detailed investigation for 56 massive galaxies on an object - to - object basis in the goods - south field at @xmath11 . combining the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; abazajian et al . 2009 ) and the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ databases ( martin et al . 2005 ) , and using the morphology of galaxies from the galaxy zoo project ( lintott et al . 2008 ; lintott et al .",
    "2011 ) , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found that the bimodality of galaxies in the color - mass diagram changes dramatically , i.e. , there is not a clear green valley dip for both late - type and early - type galaxies .",
    "a further analysis for the green valley galaxies based on the uv - optical colors shows that for the majority of late - type galaxies , their star formation rates decline secularly over several gyr .",
    "in contrast , only a small fraction of blue galaxies evolve rapidly to the red sequence by gas - rich mergers and transform from disk galaxies to spheroids that should be the recently quenched massive blue galaxies found by mcintosh et al .",
    "( 2014 ) based also on sdss database .",
    "most recently , belli et al . (",
    "2015 ) investigated 62 massive galaxies at the redshift range @xmath12 based on keck lris spectra and confirmed the fast quenching mode that is through post - starburst phase .",
    "actually , yesuf et al . (",
    "2014 ) analyzed a sample of post - starburst galaxies and concluded that the quenching mechanisms could be broadly classified as fast and slow tracks .",
    "the rapid quenching ( the fast track ) in the local universe is triggered by merger - induced starbursts .",
    "therefore , it is worth studying the fast quenching process in detail from a local gas - rich major merging galaxy sample .",
    "in fact , such a sample is already known : almost all local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath13 is the integrated infrared luminosity between 8 - 1000 @xmath14m.]@xmath15 ) and a large fraction of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath16 ) are gas - rich interacting / merging galaxies ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ; kaviraj 2009 ) .",
    "such gas - rich major mergers funnel cold molecular gas reservoirs into the centers , leading to massive starbursts ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "their stellar masses are moderate ( dasyra et al .",
    "2006a , 2006b ; da cunha et al . 2010 ; also see section 4.2 ) , but are higher than those of blue cloud galaxies ( @xmath17 ) ( kauffmann et al .",
    "similarly , a large fraction of high - redshift ulirgs are interacting / merging and starburst galaxies ( kartaltepe et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; zamojski et al . 2011 ; soto & martin 2012 ; hung et al . 2014",
    "; yan et al . 2014 ) .",
    "furthermore , casey et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found that the dusty star - forming galaxies with sfrs above @xmath18 ( lirgs and ulirgs ) are blue at both low and high redshifts and become bluer as their infrared luminosity increases . since lirgs and ulirgs are blue and have higher stellar masses than the blue cloud disk galaxies",
    ", these galaxies should occupy the bottom right corner of the color - mass diagram and may be the progenitors of massive red sequence galaxies .",
    "in fact , chen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have investigated the positions of 52 local ulirgs in the _ g - r _ color - magnitude diagram without applying internal extinction corrections , and found that @xmath846% ulirgs lie outside the 90% level number density contour , with a few in the green valley or even on the red sequence .",
    "kilerci eser et al . (",
    "2014 ) obtained similar results with a larger sample of 82 local ulirgs .",
    "if the galaxy internal extinction is corrected , these local ulirgs would appear even bluer and brighter , possibly occupying different locations in the color - magnitude and color - mass diagrams .",
    "for this purpose , we select a local ( u)lirg sample and focus on those with advanced merging ( adv - merger , hereafter ) morphologies , which are galaxies at the late gas - rich major merger stage with a single nucleus .",
    "furthermore , we perform the galaxy internal extinction correction carefully and investigate how their locations change in the sfr - mass and color - mass diagrams .    the structure of this paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the sample selection and parameters estimation for our sample adv - mergers and control samples . in section 4",
    ", we present our main results .",
    "we discuss and summarize in sections 5 and 6 respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the kroupa ( 2001 ) initial mass function and a cosmological model of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we morphologically select advanced mergers from a sdss _ r_-band limited sample of lirgs and ulirgs , most of which are in the redshift range of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "specifically , our dusty adv - merger sample is mainly drawn from the cross - correlation between the spectroscopic catalog of sdss dr7 ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; abazajian et al . 2009 ) and the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ point source catalog redshift survey ( pscz , saunders et al .",
    "2000 ) , during which we used a 5@xmath24 searching radius . given that ulirgs are very rare in the local universe ( @xmath25 ) but most of them are in the late merging stage ( e.g. sanders & mirabel , 1996 ; veilleux et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ulirgs in our sample are mainly collected by searching for counterparts of the _ iras _ 1 jy ulirgs sample ( kim & sanders 1998 ) in the sdss dr7 photometric catalog .",
    "we describe the sample selection procedures in more detail below .    since reliable morphological classifications can only be achieved for sdss galaxies brighter than 15.9 mag in the _ r_-band ( fukugita et al .",
    "2004 ) and the spectroscopic observations are incomplete for sdss galaxies with _ r_-band magnitude brighter than 14.5 mag ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003b ) , we restricted our infrared luminous and ultraluminous galaxy sample to a magnitude range of @xmath26 after corrections for foreground galactic extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) . within this magnitude range ,",
    "259 lirgs and ulirgs were obtained by the cross - correlation between the sdss dr7 and pscz .",
    "we will discuss possible selection effects caused by this magnitude cut in section 4.2.1 .",
    "furthermore , we examined the positions of sdss fibers on the images for these galaxies , and found that for 6 galaxies the fiber spectra were obtained for off - center regions .",
    "considering that the sfr might be under - estimated by the h@xmath27 emission line for these galaxies , we removed them from our sample .",
    "this step reduced the number of galaxies to 253 , out of which there are only 3 ulirgs .",
    "therefore , we perform further cross - correlation between the photometric catalog of sdss dr7 and the _ iras _ 1 jy ulirgs sample , yielding 63 ulirgs , among which there are 39 objects with sdss spectra . as the morphologies of these ulirgs have been well studied in the literature , we did not put constraints on their _ r_-band magnitudes . in total , the sample consists of 314 lirgs and ulirgs after excluding 2 overlapping objects in the above two cross - correlation procedures .",
    "considering that we are only concerned with the adv - mergers in this work , we further performed morphological classifications for the above 314 galaxies visually .",
    "the classification scheme is similar to that of wang et al .",
    "the visual classifications are primarily based on their _",
    "r_-band images from sdss dr7 or _",
    "k_-band images from the 2.2 m telescope of university of hawaii ( kim et al . 2002 ) .",
    "then we used sdss composite true color images by combining _",
    "_ filter data as cross - check ( lupton et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the sample galaxies are classified into five classes : early - type like galaxies with relaxed morphologies ( 12 ) , spiral galaxies with bars or without bars ( 118 ) , interacting galaxies with disturbed morphologies ( 55 ) , pre - merging galaxies with two or more nuclei ( 27 ) and advanced merging galaxies ( adv - merger ) with a single nucleus but some merger signs ( 100 ) .",
    "furthermore , we compared our morphological classification results with the galaxy zoo 1 ( lintott et al .",
    "2008 ; lintott et al .",
    "there are just a few different classifications ( @xmath810% ) , in which some interacting or merging galaxies in our classifications were classified as spirals or ellipticals in the galaxy zoo , but their images do show disturbed features .",
    "our classifications for early - type and spiral galaxies are almost the same as those of galaxy zoo .",
    "we only select the 100 adv - merging galaxies as our working sample .",
    "figure [ colorim.eps ] shows the true color images of 8 example adv - mergers .    since spectral information is needed in our subsequent analysis , one ulirg without such information was excluded .",
    "in addition , we removed 10 objects with seyfert 1 spectra from our sample , as the estimations for their extinctions , stellar masses and star formation rates are unreliable .",
    "thus our final adv - merger sample consists of 89 galaxies ( 60 lirgs and 29 ulirgs ) . according to the commonly used spectral classification bpt diagram proposed by baldwin et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and developed by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on [ ]  @xmath28/h@xmath27 versus [ ]  @xmath29/h@xmath30 , we classified our sample galaxies into 25 star - forming galaxies , 42 composite galaxies and 20 narrow - line agns ( including seyfert 2 and low - ionization narrow emission - line region galaxies ) .",
    "for the remaining two galaxies , the line fluxes have signal - to - noise ratios too low ( s / n @xmath31 5 ) to be classified reliably . the black line and gray shaded histograms in figure [ zlirdis.eps ] represent the redshift ( left panel ) and infrared luminosity ( right panel ) distributions for the 314 ( u)lirgs before morphological classification and the 89 sample adv - merger ( u)lirgs , respectively . in the left panel of figure [ zlirdis.eps ]",
    ", we also overplot the redshift distributions of lirgs ( blue line ) and ulirgs ( red line ) separately .",
    "it can be seen that the lower redshift region ( @xmath22 ) is dominated by lirgs and the higher redshift region ( @xmath23 ) is occupied by ulirgs .      for consistent estimates of physical parameters between our working sample and the comparison samples ,",
    "we do not use published relations in the literature .",
    "instead , we constructed the control samples by ourselves .",
    "the control sample used to investigate the sfr-@xmath0 relation for star - forming galaxies has been extracted from the sdss dr7 and satisfies @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the star - forming galaxies were selected according to the bpt diagram given by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "the sample selection procedure is similar to that of brinchmann et al .",
    "this leaves us with 152137 galaxies . for the color - mass relation ,",
    "the control sample was retrieved from the oh - sarzi - schawinski - yi ( ossy ) catalog ( oh et al .",
    "2011)ksoh / wordpress ] , which is a spectroscopically selected galaxy sample from the sdss dr7 with redshifts z @xmath31 0.2 .",
    "it provides internal extinction information ( e(b - v ) ) from stellar continuum fits ( ebv_star ) . for comparison with schawinski",
    "( 2014 ) in the color - mass relation studies , we further restricted the redshift of the comparison sample to @xmath34 and luminosity @xmath35 mag to obtain an approximately mass - limited sample as described in schawinski et al .",
    "the final control sample consists of 53604 galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we mainly investigate the positions of adv - merger ( u)lirgs in the sfr - stellar mass and the color - stellar mass diagrams .",
    "hence we need to carefully estimate the star formation rates , dust extinction corrected _ u - r _ , _ nuv - r _ colors , as well as stellar masses for our sample adv - mergers and the control sample galaxies .",
    "the optical photometric data are all from sdss dr7 , while the near ultraviolet ( _ nuv _ ) magnitudes are from the _ galex _ satellite ( martin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there are 79 sample adv - mergers and @xmath36 control sample galaxies with _ nuv _ photometric data available from the _",
    "galex_. we first performed _",
    "k_-corrections to the optical and _ nuv _ magnitudes , followed by the galactic extinction and internal extinction corrections .",
    "k_-corrections to the optical and _ nuv _ magnitudes were performed using the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; blanton & roweis 2007 ) and by the idl routine calc_kcor.pro ( chilingarian et al .",
    "2010 ; chilingarian & zolotukhin 2012 ) , respectively .",
    "the foreground galactic extinctions were corrected using dust maps from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for the galaxies with sdss spectroscopic information , the ebv_star values from the ossy catalog ( oh et al .",
    "2011 ) have been directly used to correct for the internal dust extinctions . however , for 10 ulirgs not in the sdss spectroscopic catalog and thus not in the ossy catalog , we had to perform internal extinction corrections ourselves , which is described as follows .",
    "first , we calculated the color excess in the gas ( ebv_gas ) for the ulirgs in the sdss spectroscopic survey using balmer decrements h@xmath27/h@xmath30 , assuming the case b recombination value of intrinsic h@xmath27/h@xmath30 as 2.86 and 3.1 for star - forming galaxies and agns , respectively ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "second , we obtained the relation between ebv_star and ebv_gas for these galaxies : ebv_star@xmath37ebv_gas .",
    "finally , we retrieved the balmer decrements for those ulirgs without sdss spectra from literature ( veilleux et al .",
    "1999 ; darling et al .",
    "2006 ) to calculate ebv_gas and derived their ebv_star using the ebv_star and ebv_gas relation fitted above . at the last step ,",
    "the dust extinction corrected _ u - r _ colors and _ nuv _ magnitudes for all sample galaxies were obtained using the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) extinction law and cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) law , respectively , following schawinski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . for our adv - merger sample ,",
    "the median internal extinction is 0.89 mag for the _ u - r _ color .",
    "the stellar masses for most sample adv - mergers and all the control sample galaxies were retrieved from the max planck institute for astrophysics - johns hopkins university ( mpa / jhu ) stellar mass catalog ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003b ) , which were estimated using the sdss five broad - band photometry .",
    "briefly , a median likelihood estimate of the stellar mass was derived by comparing the five broad - band photometry with the synthetic photometry of a large library of model star formation histories using the bayesian methodology .",
    "this library of model star formation histories includes bursting and continuous star formation histories and covers a wide range in metallicity . in other words , this method has already taken proper star formation histories into account during the modeling .",
    "so for both galaxies with bursting star formation histories and those with continuous star formation histories , the stellar mass estimates should not suffer from systematical impact from improper assumptions of their star formation histories .",
    "for galaxies not included in the mpa / jhu stellar mass catalog , 10 out of 89 sample galaxies , we calculated the stellar masses following bell et al .",

    "r_-band absolute magnitude in the ab magnitude system and @xmath41 is the color in the rest - frame .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are taken as @xmath44 and 1.097 , respectively , and the term @xmath45 is adopted for the kroupa initial mass function ( see bell et al .",
    "2003 ) . to check the consistency between these two methods",
    ", we computed the stellar masses for the galaxies included in the mpa / jhu stellar mass catalog using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the median difference of the two approaches is 0.03 dex .",
    "therefore , the equation of bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) can be used statistically to measure the stellar masses for galaxies not in the mpa / jhu catalog . even though , we still use stellar masses taken from mpa / jhu for most sample galaxies in this work , because for our dusty starburst galaxies the stellar mass based on five broad - band photometry and using the way described above should be more reliable for individual galaxy than that using only two band photometry by bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "given that all our sample adv - mergers are infrared luminous and selected from the _ iras _ database , the star formation rate can be derived from their total infrared luminosity , following kennicutt ( 1998 , k98 hereafter ) @xmath46    on the other hand , we can also calculate the star formation rate for star - forming and composite adv - mergers and 152137 star - forming control sample galaxies using their h@xmath27 luminosities retrieved from the mpa / jhu catalog following k98 @xmath47 the h@xmath27 luminosities are aperture - corrected using the difference of the _ r_-band petrosian magnitude to the fiber magnitude ( hopkins et al .",

    "it is generally accepted that star - forming galaxies lie on the ms of the sfr-@xmath48 relation while starburst galaxies are located above the ms ( rodighiero et al .",

    "2011 ; whitaker et al . 2012 ; sargent et al .",
    "note that for the normal star - forming galaxies used to fit the ms relation , their sfrs are calculated with their h@xmath27 luminosities , which are consistent with those estimated from their infrared luminosities ( kennicutt et al .",

    "2013 ) .",

    "2007 ; da cunha et al .",
    "the fraction of lirgs above ms relation is also high ( @xmath53 ) . given that the definition of starburst galaxies based on deviations from the ms relation varies in the literature ( rodighiero et al .",
    "2011 ; hung et al .",

    "since our goal is to investigate the role of gas - rich major mergers on galaxy evolution from the blue cloud to the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the color - mass diagram , accurate dust extinction correction is very important .",
    "schawinski et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found that the galaxies in the blue cloud are bluer in the dust extinction corrected color - mass diagram compared with the uncorrected one , leading to a more prominent blue cloud and red sequence .",
    "for our adv - merger ( u)lirgs sample , dust extinction is even more serious : the median internal extinction is 0.89 mag on the _ u - r _ color as derived in section 3 .",
    "therefore , we performed both foreground galactic and galaxy internal extinction corrections carefully .",
    "figure [ cmdadv_ur.eps ] illustrates the foreground galactic and internal dust extinction corrected _ u - r _ color - mass diagram . in the left panel of figure [ cmdadv_ur.eps ] ,",
    "the gray dots represent 53604 comparison sample galaxies ( see section 2.2 ) , and the overlaid contours show the galaxy number densities for these galaxies . the lowest density contour represents the 90% number density .",
    "the control sample galaxies show an obvious bimodal distribution as the blue cloud and the red sequence .",
    "the area in between is the green valley .",

    "the median galactic extinction for the comparison sample is @xmath8 0.07 mag .",
    "since the boundary definition of the green valley is somewhat arbitrary , the adjustment we took is more suitable for the galaxy distribution in the color - mass diagram shown in figure [ cmdadv_ur.eps ] than those given by equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the red and blue filled circles in the left panel of figure [ cmdadv_ur.eps ] represent adv - merger ulirgs and lirgs , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the left panel of figure [ cmdadv_ur.eps ] that almost all our sample galaxies are indeed localized to the right of blue cloud galaxies in the color - mass diagram and @xmath57 sample galaxies are outside the lowest density contour due to their larger stellar masses and bluer colors ( simply refer to `` at the bottom right corner of the color - mass diagram '' , hereafter ) .",

    "therefore , it appears that the stellar masses measured via sed modeling are reliable for local ulirgs .    to extend the size of sample ( u)lirgs with dynamical masses ( @xmath72 )",

    "2002 ) have already found that the effective radii measured in the _ k-_band are smaller than those in the _ r-_band for _ iras _ 1 jy ulirgs samples , due to the extremely dusty environment for the ulirgs . in contrast , the velocity dispersion measurements have no significant systematic differences from different wavebands ( dasyra et al .",
    "therefore , the dynamical masses for 74 sample ( u)lirgs measured by sdss may be at some level overestimated .    from the comparisons of stellar masses with the dynamical masses from different datasets , we conclude that the stellar masses measured via sed modeling are not over - estimated for our sample ( u)lirgs . therefore , the adv - merger ( u)lirgs are located in the bottom right corner of the color - mass diagrams .",
    "when we investigate the locus of our sample adv - merging ( u)lirgs in the sfr-@xmath48 diagram , the sfrs were estimated using their infrared luminosities",
    ". however , hayward et al .",
    "( 2014 ) argued based on their hydrodynamical simulations that for strong starburst galaxies at the post - starburst phase , the instantaneous sfr calculated from the infrared luminosity can be severely over - estimated .",
    "this is because the contribution from ob stars to dust heating decreases ( the lifetime of ob stars is only @xmath77 to @xmath78 years ) and that from older stellar populations becomes non - negligible when the sfr starts to decrease ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "therefore the infrared luminosity is not a good indicator of the instantaneous sfr for galaxies at the post - starburst phase , although it is the best sfr tracer for extremely dusty starbursts . on the other hand ,",
    "the most commonly used h@xmath27 luminosity can serve as a good sfr indicator for normal star - forming galaxies , for which dust attenuation can be corrected properly . however , for dusty starburst galaxies , massive starbursts tend to take place in obscured circumnuclear regions ( k98 ) where the optical depths are generally an order of magnitude higher than the upper limit of the reddening correction for h@xmath27 ( @xmath82.5 mag ) ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2006 ; moustakas et al .",
    "it is impossible to correct internal dust extinctions accurately for such high optical depths with the balmer decrements . in such cases ,",
    "the h@xmath27 luminosity will under - estimate the real sfrs for dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "given that our galaxy sample consists of both galaxies with transiting post - starburst features ( see section 5.3 ) and dusty starbursts , it is very likely that the real sfrs of our sample galaxies are in between the sfr(ir ) and sfr(h@xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , it is worth investigating the positions of our galaxies on the sfr(h@xmath27)-@xmath48 diagram to see how much will be changed compared to the sfr(ir)-@xmath48 diagram shown in figure [ mslir.eps ] .",
    "we plot the sfr(h@xmath27 ) versus stellar mass in figure [ msha.eps ] , which is the same as figure [ mslir.eps ] except that the h@xmath27 luminosity is used as the sfr indicator .",
    "it is clear from figure [ msha.eps ] that the positions of our sample ( u)lirgs in the sfr(h@xmath27)-@xmath48 are quite different from those in figure [ mslir.eps ] . in particular ,",
    "ulirgs are located just above the ms relation and mixed with lirgs as shown in figure [ msha.eps ] , rather than being apparent outliers as in figure [ mslir.eps ] .",
    "even so , most of our dusty adv - merging ( u)lirgs are still located above the ms line in both figures [ mslir.eps ] and [ msha.eps ] , for which sfrs are estimated from @xmath13 and l(h@xmath27 ) , respectively . therefore the use of different sfr indicators does not influence our main conclusions reached in section 4.1 .",
    "the morphologies and locus of our sample adv - merger ( u)lirgs on the sfr(ir)-@xmath48 relation as shown in figure [ mslir.eps ] suggest that most of them are experiencing massive starbursts as triggered by gas - rich major mergers .",
    "these galaxies are blue and massive with stellar mass @xmath79 ; they are located to the right of the blue cloud galaxies on the optical and nuv color - mass diagrams , implying that they belong to a distinct population being neither in the blue cloud , red sequence nor the green valley . in spite of the limited data , it is still interesting to investigate how these adv - merger ( u)lirgs may evolve on the color - mass diagrams . to explore this issue ,",
    "two questions naturally arise : what is the timescale for adv - merger ( u)lirgs exhausting their molecular gas , and then evolving to post - starbursts and finally being quenched ? are there transiting objects from starbursts to post - starbursts among our sample galaxies ?    the starburst duration of adv - merger ( u)lirgs can be simply quantified by the gas consumption timescale , i.e. , the available gas mass divided by the current sfr . as already pointed out by daddi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and genzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) based on co observations for both low and high redshift galaxies , the molecular gas consumption is bimodal .",
    "disk galaxies consume their gas reservoir slowly , while in starburst galaxies the gas is rapidly exhausted .",
    "the fast mode occurs because during a gas - rich major merger gas falls toward the central region and starbursts take place at central kpc rapidly due to high dense gas fractions ( downes & solomon 1998 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "given that only 8 of our sample adv - merger ( u)lirgs have existing co data , we examine the molecular gas depletion timescales mainly based on the adv - merger ( u)lirgs sample by liu et al .",

    "<S> with the aim of exploring the fast evolutionary path from the blue cloud of star - forming galaxies to the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the local universe , we select a local advanced merging infrared luminous and ultraluminous galaxy ( adv - merger ( u)lirgs ) sample and perform careful dust extinction corrections to investigate their positions in the sfr-@xmath0 , _ u - r _ and _ nuv - r _ color - mass diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of 89 ( u)lirgs at the late merger stage , obtained from cross - correlating the _ iras _ point source catalog redshift survey and 1 jy ulirgs samples with the sloan digital sky survey dr7 database . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that @xmath1 of adv - merger ( u)lirgs are localized above the @xmath2 line of the local star - forming galaxy main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that all adv - merger ( u)lirgs are more massive than and as blue as the blue cloud galaxies after corrections of galactic and internal dust extinctions , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 of them outside the blue cloud on the _ u - r _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> nuv - r _ color - mass diagrams , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these results , combined with the short timescale for exhausting the molecular gas reservoir in adv - merger ( u)lirgs ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 years ) , imply that the adv - merger ( u)lirgs are likely at the starting point of the fast evolutionary track previously proposed by several groups . while the number density of adv - merger ( u)lirgs is only @xmath7 of the blue cloud star - forming galaxies in the local universe , this evolutionary track may play a more important role at high redshift . </S>"
