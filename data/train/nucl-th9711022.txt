    "the effective chiral lagrangian formalism which has proved successful in explaining the properties of meson - meson interaction at low energies @xcite has also proved to be an idoneous tool to study low energy properties of the meson - baryon interaction @xcite .",
    "the s - wave @xmath4 and @xmath5 interaction is relatively weak and the leading term in the chiral expansion @xmath6 is the dominant one @xcite . by contrary , in the @xmath0 sector , the @xmath7 system couples strongly to many other channels and generates a resonance below threshold in s - wave , the @xmath1 . in such case",
    "the standard chiral perturbative scheme , an expansion in powers of the typical momenta involved in the process , fails to be an appropiate approach , since the singularities of the @xmath8 matrix associated to the resonance can not be generated perturbatively .    a non perturbative scheme to the @xmath0 meson - baryon sector , yet using the input of the chiral lagrangians , was employed in @xcite .",
    "a set of coupled - channel lippmann schwinger ( ls ) equations was solved using the lowest and next to lowest order chiral lagrangians .",
    "the @xmath1 resonance was generated and the cross sections of the @xmath9 reactions at low energies , plus the threshold branching ratios , were well reproduced . in summary ,",
    "five parameters were needed to fit the experimental information , corresponding to , so far , unknown parameters of the second order chiral lagrangian plus some range parameters used to construct a potential from the chiral lagrangians .",
    "the method was also used to study coupled channels in the @xmath4 sector plus eta meson and kaon photoproduction in @xcite .",
    "the role of the resonance is so important in @xmath10 scattering at low energies that any finite - order chiral expansion will fail to reproduce the data , unless the @xmath11 is introduced as an elementary matter field@xcite .",
    "another approach based on the coupled - channel ls equations @xcite started from transition potentials whose relative strength between various channels was guided by su(3 ) symmetry but was allowed to be broken by up to @xmath12 in order to fit the data .",

    "@xcite has stimulated work in the meson - meson sector . in @xcite",
    "similar ideas were followed and , by means of coupled - channel ls equations using the lowest order chiral lagrangian , plus a suitable cut off in the loops in order to simulate the effect of the second order lagrangian , an excellent reproduction of the @xmath13 resonances in the scalar sector , plus phase shifts and inelasticities in the different physical channels was obtained .",
    "the work required just one free parameter , the cut off , @xmath14 , in the momentum of the loop .",
    "however , the extension of these ideas to the @xmath15 sector proved that the cut off alone was insufficient to account for the information contained in the second order chiral lagrangians and the generation of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances required further input .    in @xcite the method of @xcite",
    "was generalized using ideas of the inverse amplitude method @xcite leading to a unitary coupled - channel non perturbative scheme that includes the works of @xcite and @xcite as particular cases .",
    "it uses the input of the first and second order lagrangians and a cut off regularization and reproduces all the meson - meson experimental information up to @xmath18 gev , including the resonances @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "the work requires the use of 7 parameters , coefficients of the second order chiral lagrangians in the meson - meson interaction @xcite .    in the present work we want to extend the ideas of @xcite to the @xmath7 sector and investigate the possibility to describe all the low energy experimental cross sections plus the @xmath1 resonance in terms of the lowest order chiral lagrangian ( with no free parameters ) and one cut off . as we shall see , we succeed in the enterprise , thus stressing the role of chiral symmetry in the meson - baryon interaction and at the same time the usefulness of the unitary coupled - channel method of @xcite to deal with this kind of reactions .",
    "the work presented here shares many points with @xcite but has one different main result .",
    "the authors of @xcite were able to reproduce fairly well the experimental cross sections with just the lowest order lagrangian , but found substantial differences with the threshold branching ratios .",
    "we can reproduce all the results with the lowest order lagrangian and one cut off .",
    "the main reason for the differences is the inclusion of two extra channels in our approach . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels were considered .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels open up at higher @xmath24 energies than studied in @xcite and thus they were omitted in that work .",

    "we should notice that , in addition to the six channels considered in @xcite we have the two @xmath39 channels , @xmath40 and @xmath23 .",
    "although these channels are above threshold for @xmath37 scattering at low energies , they couple strongly to the @xmath37 system and there are important interferences between the real parts of the amplitudes , which make their inclusion in the coupled - channel approach very important as we shall see .    the lowest order amplitudes for these channels are easily evaluated from eq .",

    "we shall construct the amplitudes using the isospin formalism for which we must use average masses for the @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) states .",
    "the isospin amplitudes are    @xmath54    where we use the phase convention @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 for the isospin states , consistent with the structure of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 matrices .",

    "we shall make use of it too in order to investigate the isospin violation effects .",

    "when working with the physical masses of the @xmath83,@xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the coupling of the channels breaks slightly this symmetry but still leads to a very small amplitude as we shall see .",
    "c)@xmath87 and related channels .    for the purpose of @xmath24 nucleus interaction we shall also need the @xmath69 amplitude which we evaluate here .",
    "the coupled channels in this case , which is only @xmath62 , are @xmath88 .",
    "since the matrix elements of the potential satisfy isospin symmetry , these matrix elements are easily induced from section 3 and tables ii and iii .",
    "we have    @xmath89    where the @xmath90 coefficients are given in table v.",
    "following @xcite we write the set of lippmann schwinger equations in the @xmath7 centre of mass frame    @xmath91    where the indices @xmath92 run over all possible channels and    @xmath93    eq .",

    "1 . in eq . ( 16 ) we have kept the positive energy part of the baryon propagator , although with proper relativistic factors in order to ensure exact phase space in the imaginary part of the expressions . in eq .

( 16 ) is regularized through the use of a momentum cut off , @xmath14 . the value of @xmath14 is a free parameter of the theory by means of which one accounts for higher order contributions in an effective way .",
    "some other comments must be made with respect to the off shell extrapolation of @xmath96 which run in parallel to the findings of @xcite .",
    "in that work the potential was split into an on shell part plus a rest . the contribution from this latter part was found to go into renormalization of couplings and masses and could hence be omitted in the calculation .",
    "this simplified the coupled integral equations which became then ordinary algebraic equations .",
    "the same happens here , as we see below .",
    "let us take the one loop diagram of fig . 1 and equal masses in the external and intermediate states for simplicity .",
    "we have    @xmath97    with @xmath98 a constant .",
    "the first term in the last expression is the on shell contribution @xmath99 . neglecting @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) , typical approximations in the heavy baryon formalism @xcite , the one loop integral for the second term of eq .",
    "( 17 ) becomes @xmath101    @xmath102    as we can see this term is proportional to @xmath103 and hence can be reabsorbed by a suitable renormalization of the coupling @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the use of the physical coupling will incorporate this term . in the case of coupled channels",
    "the arguments are similar .",
    "the contribution of eq .",
    "( 18 ) has the same structure as the lowest order terms and can be reabsorbed in the lowest order lagrangian by a suitable renormalization , leading to the effective chiral lagrangian with the physical couplings .",
    "similarly , the term proportional to @xmath105 will cancell the @xmath106 term in the denominator and the integral of this term , proportional to @xmath106 , gives rise to another term proportional to @xmath107 ( and hence @xmath103 ) while the term proportional to @xmath108 vanishes for parity reasons .",
    "we can extend these arguments to higher order loops and the conclusion is that we can factorize @xmath103 and @xmath109 outside the integral of eq .",

    "the method of @xcite provides an alternative reinterpretation of the on shell factorization which is clarifying .",
    "the method uses the optical theorem to start with , which is stated here as    @xmath115    from where one deduces @xmath116    hence @xmath117^{-1 } = \\\\ v [ v \\ , re \\ , t^{-1 } \\",

    "the freedom of the cut off can be used to make @xmath125 , in which case eq .",
    "( 25 ) reduces to the ls equations implicit in eq .",
    "the success of the ls method in @xcite suggests that the expansion of @xmath126 , and the approximation to @xmath127 given above , are sensible approximations at least in the scalar sector for the meson - meson interaction .",
    "one hopes that this is also the case for the meson - baryon interaction in @xmath128 that we study here .",
    "the coupled - channel equations represented by eq . ( 19 ) are solved in the isospin basis for the @xmath129 cases , from where the amplitudes in the physical channels are then constructed .",
    "alternatively we can work directly with the physical states using the matrix of table i and the physical masses of each particle .",
    "the second method is more accurate and respects exactly the thresholds for the reaction and the phase space .",
    "we use both methods and this allows us to see the amount of isospin violation in the different channels .",
    "the channels @xmath130 are above threshold for low energies of the @xmath24 .",
    "the potential @xmath131 for these channels is taken through an analytical continuation using the formula    @xmath132",
    "the @xmath1 resonance appears below the @xmath37 threshold .",
    "it is observed in the mass spectrum of @xmath70 .",
    "one of the reactions used to see it is @xmath135 @xcite .    according to @xcite , the mass distribution of the @xmath136 state , for s - wave resonance , is given by    @xmath137    where @xmath98 is a constant , @xmath138 is the @xmath139 amplitude and @xmath140 is the @xmath50 momentum in the frame where @xmath70 is at rest .",
    "with the normalization which we use , the cross section is given by    @xmath141    the relationship to the scattering lengths in elastic channels reported in @xcite is    @xmath142    calculated at threshold .",
    "we look at the cross sections for @xmath143 at low energies plus the @xmath70 mass distribution and the threshold branching ratios .",
    "our free parameter is @xmath14 , but we allow also some small variation of @xmath104 from the pionic value of @xmath144 mev . for kaons in the meson - meson interaction @xmath145 and we should expect a similar renormalization here .",
    "however , for simplicity , we use a single value of @xmath104 for pions and kaons which is fit to the data and turns out to be between @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the threshold branching ratios which we use in the fitting procedure , as in @xcite , are @xcite :    @xmath148    note that the ratio @xmath149 is zero in lowest order of the chiral lagrangians ( see table i ) .",
    "the coupled - channel ls equations lead to a finite cross section for @xmath150 which is larger than the @xmath151 as we shall see .",
    "our fitting procedure proceeds as follows : first we fix a value of @xmath104 around @xmath144 mev and vary @xmath14 in order to get the best reproduction of the threshold parameters , @xmath152 .",
    "there is a correlation between the values of @xmath14 and @xmath104 leading to the best fit to these threshold parameters .",
    "a @xmath153 increase in @xmath104 can be compensated with a @xmath154 increase in @xmath14 .",
    "the shape and position of the @xmath1 resonance depend on the value of @xmath104 ( and its associated @xmath14 from the previous fit ) and we choose the value of @xmath104 which leads to the best agreement with the @xmath1 properties seen in the @xmath70 mass spectrum .",
    "this procedure determines @xmath155 and no further input is used in the fit .",
    "the cross sections are then calculated with the best choice of parameters and have not not been used in a best fit to the data . as we shall see",
    ", it is a remarkable feature of this chiral coupled - channel approach that the threshold ratios plus the position and shape of the @xmath1 determine the behaviour of the @xmath37 cross sections at low energies in all channels .",
    "our optimal choice was found for @xmath156 mev .",
    "the following results are evaluated inverting the @xmath157 matrix @xmath158 with @xmath159 given in table i. we will also show the results obtained using the isospin basis and inverting @xmath158 with v given by tables ii and iii . at the same time",
    "we show the results obtained omitting the @xmath40 and @xmath23 channels as done in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath70 spectrum corresponding to the @xmath160 resonance . as we can see , the peak position and width are well reproduced .",
    "the results obtained using the isospin basis and those omitting the @xmath39 channels are also shown in the figure .",
    "the results with the isospin basis are similar to those obtained with the basis of physical states , however , omitting the @xmath39 channels leads to a quite different mass distribution , which is incompatible with the data .",
    "obviously one can choose other values of @xmath104 and @xmath14 to reproduce the mass distribution without the @xmath39 channels but , as shown in @xcite and corroborated here , one can not obtain a global fit to the data . in any case ,",
    "one of the points in this paper is to show the relevance of the inclusion of the @xmath39 channels in the coupled - channel equations , and the results for the @xmath1 resonance are a clear example of it , although more spectacular effects on other observables will be shown in the following .    in table",
    "vi we display the results for the threshold ratios evaluated in the three cases : isospin basis , full basis and omitting @xmath39 channels .",
    "we can see that the three ratios are reproduced within @xmath161 in the calculation with the full basis .",
    "note that using the isospin basis or omitting the @xmath39 channels produces appreciable changes in these ratios .",
    "particularly remarkable is the change in the ratio @xmath149 , which is reduced by a factor 2.2 when the @xmath39 channels are omitted .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the small values for @xmath149 obtained in @xcite , which are compatible with our value when the @xmath39 channels are omitted , motivated the authors of that work to introduce higher order terms in the chiral expansion and perform a global fit with five parameters .    in figs .",
    "38 we compare our cross sections with the low - energy scattering data@xcite .",
    "we show the results obtained with the full basis of eight physical coupled states ( full line ) , with the isospin basis ( short - dashed line ) and omitting the @xmath39 channels ( long - dashed line ) . the elastic cross section @xmath162 is displayed in fig .",
    "the cross section calculated with the isospin basis is about @xmath163 higher at low energies than the one evaluated using the basis of physical states .",
    "another interesting feature is the cusp appearing around the @xmath24 lab momentum @xmath164 mev / c in the full basis calculation , which corresponds to the opening of the @xmath165 channel .",
    "this cusp appears weakened and at lower energies in the calculation with the isospin basis as a consequence of the use of average masses for @xmath166 , @xmath50 , @xmath48 and @xmath52 .",
    "more spectacular is the effect of omitting the @xmath130 channels which leads to a 60% larger @xmath37 elastic cross section close to threshold and about @xmath167 larger around @xmath168 mev / c .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the cross section for @xmath169 .",
    "the results for the isospin basis calculation and those using the full basis are nearly identical .",
    "omitting the @xmath40 and @xmath170 channels in this case reduces the cross section in @xmath171 around @xmath172 mev / c and above .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the cross section for @xmath173 . in this case",
    "the use of the isospin basis nearly doubles the cross section close to threshold with respect to the results with the full basis .",
    "the effects of omitting the @xmath130 channels are more moderate here and amount to an increase of about @xmath171 in the region of the cusp and about @xmath174 at momenta higher than @xmath175 mev / c .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the cross section for @xmath150 .",
    "the results using the isospin basis are about @xmath176 larger close to threshold than those obtained with the full basis .",
    "the effects of omitting the @xmath39 channels are moderate and result into an increase of the cross section of about @xmath177 close to threshold and a negligible change for @xmath178 mev / c .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the cross section for @xmath179 .",
    "although not visible in the figure , the cross section at energies close to threshold using the isospin basis is about @xmath163 higher than the one obtained with the full basis .",
    "omitting the @xmath39 channels increases the cross section in about 60% close to threshold and in about @xmath180 at @xmath181 mev / c .    finally , in fig .",
    "8 we show the results for the @xmath151 reaction .",
    "the cross sections at threshold with the isospin and the full bases are similar , but the latter results show a very pronounced cusp around @xmath164 mev / c corresponding to the opening of the @xmath165 channel .",
    "this cusp is shifted to lower energies and is less aparent in the case of the isospin basis .",
    "the omission of the @xmath39 channels has in this case a spectacular effect .",
    "the cross section is multiplied by a factor of nearly three close to threshold when the @xmath39 channels are omitted . as a consequence",
    "the threshold ratio @xmath149 is very sensitive to the @xmath39 channels as is evident from the results in table vi . around @xmath182 mev",
    "/ c the cross section omitting the @xmath39 channels is about twice as large as the full calculation .",
    "one of the novel findings of the present work is that the inclusion of the @xmath39 channels is very important and allows one to obtain a good reproduction of the data by means of the lowest order lagrangian alone using a cut off , @xmath14 , and changing @xmath104 moderatly from the @xmath183 value of the meson - meson interaction .    in fig .",
    "9 , following the parallelism with the work of @xcite , we show the amplitudes for @xmath162 and @xmath184 calculated with the full basis of physical states and including the @xmath39 channels .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained in @xcite .    in table",
    "vii we show the scattering lengths for @xmath37 and @xmath69 calculated with the three methods .",
    "we observe that isospin breaking effects in the @xmath69 amplitude , as well as those omitting the @xmath39 channel , are moderate in this case .",
    "we shoud note that this is a @xmath62 channel where the @xmath1 resonance is not present",
    ". however , the @xmath37 amplitude , which is affected by the presence of the resonance , shows a larger sensitivity to isospin breaking effects and the @xmath39 channels .",
    "the @xmath37 scattering length is also in good agreement with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the results obtained with the isospin basis are closer to those obtained in the full basis in our case , while in @xcite @xmath185 is about a factor two smaller when average masses for @xmath46 and @xmath48 are used .",
    "our results for the @xmath37 scattering length are essentially in agreement with the most recent results from kaonic hydrogen @xmath186 rays @xcite , @xmath187 fm , and in qualitative agreement with the scattering length determined from scattering data in @xcite , @xmath188 fm with 15% estimated error .",
    "these latter results are obtained from the isospin scattering lengths determined in @xcite , but as we can see from table vii there are violations of isospin at the level of @xmath171 in these amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath69 scattering length is also in qualitative agreement with the @xmath62 value of @xcite , @xmath189 fm with also 15% estimated errors .",
    "it is also worth calling the attention to the remarkable agreement of our results for the real part of the scattering lengths with those obtained in @xcite from a combined dispersion relation and m matrix analysis , @xmath190 fm , @xmath191 fm .",
    "next we look at the @xmath67 sector . in fig .",
    "10 we show the phase shifts in the isospin channel @xmath62 .",
    "the agreement with experiment@xcite is fair but the phase shifts in absolute value are a little smaller than experiment .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to the one obtained in @xcite , where it was also shown that allowing for a @xmath192 shorter range parameter ( larger cut off in our case ) the agreement with data improves .    on the other hand",
    "the scattering length in @xmath60 , which was zero at lowest order ( eq . ( 13 ) ) , becomes finite , although negligibly small , as a consequence of the coupling to other channels when the different masses are kept .",
    "we obtain a value    @xmath193    which is compatible with present experimental data , @xmath194 fm @xcite .",
    "we also evaluate the scattering length for @xmath5 in @xmath62 , for which we get    @xmath195    which compares reasonably with the experimental number @xmath196 fm @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is similar to the one obtained for the phase shifts in fig .",
    "10 . for completeness",
    "we also show the phase shifts for @xmath66 in fig .",
    "we have presented here a method of coupled - channel lippmann schwinger equations which allows us to evaluate the @xmath128 amplitudes and obtain a good description of the @xmath197 cross sections at low energies plus the properties of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "the method uses as input only the lowest order chiral lagrangian which is used as a source of the potential in the ls equations , and a cut off to regularize the loop integrals .    using different argumentations we showed that in the loop evaluation only the on - shell part of the potential was needed , which reduced the coupled - channel integral equations to algebraic equations .",
    "the approach is more economical than the one of @xcite in which it was inspired .",
    "here one obtains a good reproduction of the data without the need to use the information from higher order lagrangians .",
    "we should note that the parameters of these lagrangians do not have a fixed value .",
    "they depend upon the energy scale chosen for the regularization @xcite . in our language",
    "this means that they depend upon the cut off @xmath14 which plays a similar role to the energy scale in the dimensional regularization of @xcite .",
    "the success of our method using only the lowest order lagrangian implies that the chosen cut off minimizes the effect of the higher order lagrangians in the l = 0 channel that we have studied . the same thing happened in the meson - meson interaction in @xmath128 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a form factor is used with a range similar to our cut off , but a solution using only the lowest order lagrangians could not be found .",
    "although a fair reproduction of the cross sections and @xmath70 mass distribution could be found , the threshold parameters , particularly @xmath149 , were very poorly reproduced .",
    "we have reconfirmed these findings omitting the @xmath130 channels in the coupled - channel system .",
    "however , and this is one of the main findings of the present work , the situation is drastically changed when these channels are included . the ratio @xmath149 is increased by about a factor 2.2 , coming in good agreement with the data , and an appreciable change in all the channels is induced , particularly in the @xmath198 reactions , and most specially in the @xmath199 reaction whose cross section is reduced in about a factor three at small energies .",
    "as commented above , our fit to the data was done only for the threshold ratios and the @xmath1 properties .",
    "this determined @xmath104 and @xmath14 .",
    "the value @xmath200 obtained in the best fit lies between @xmath183 and @xmath147 in the meson - meson interaction and appears as a reasonable renormalization of @xmath183 in the @xmath7 sector .",
    "the cross sections were not used for the fit . in spite of that , it is remarkable to see the agreement of the results obtained with the data .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath201 are in very good agreement with the data .",
    "those for the @xmath151 are also compatible with the data within errors , with small discrepancies in the deep region around @xmath202 mev / c largely influenced by a cusp effect in our case .",
    "only the @xmath173 cross section appears to overestimate slightly the scarce available data .",
    "the success of our approach in @xmath7 and coupled channels for @xmath128 with the lowest order lagrangian and a cut off does not mean that the procedure can be generalized to all meson - nucleon channels .",
    "the richness of this information most probably requires the use of higher order chiral lagrangians , as it was the case in the meson - meson interaction when including all different channels @xcite . for the purpose of determining these higher order terms , for a chosen scale of energies in the regularization scheme ( cut off in our method ) , a global fit to all meson - nucleon data would have to be conducted in analogy to the work of @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the success of our scheme , wich is quite economical , could be exploited to address problems related with the propagation of kaons in matter , a topic which has aroused much interest lately @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank b. krippa for discussions and some useful checks .",
