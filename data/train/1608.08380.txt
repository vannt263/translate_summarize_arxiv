    "the behaviour of the two models is qualitatively similar .",
    "the difference is made apparent by varying @xmath66 . as the value of @xmath66 decreases , the density profile becomes steeper , this results in a greater deviation from the wb75 @xmath55 as the value of @xmath66 decreases .",
    "the net effect is to smooth out the acceleration region , leading to the wind passing through a more gradual acceleration , which extends further from the star .",

    "the changes in the spectral index @xmath55 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_comparison ] and these show that substantial changes in @xmath55 are predicted across the alma bands for these clumping models and it will be possible to observe these changes for several nearby o - stars ( see below ) .",

    "have so far had comparable sensitivity to alma .",
    "this sensitivity allows for the detection of sub - mjy flux from an unresolved point source such as the massive stars which are being considered in this work .",
    "therefore , observations which can determine the contribution to @xmath6 from the acceleration regions of massive stars will be possible providing a further avenue for diagnosis of massive star winds .    to determine the enhancement of @xmath6 due to the acceleration region we introduce the following quantity : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spectral flux due to the acceleration region and @xmath77 is the spectral flux due to the wb75 model including the rj flux .",
