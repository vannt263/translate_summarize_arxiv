    "a ferroic is a material which exhibits spontaneous and switchable ordering of electric polarization or magnetization or elastic strain .",
    "materials exhibiting more than one of such orderings termed ` multiferroics'- have recently become the focus of much research@xcite .",
    "most of the biferroics investigated in recent years are @xmath3 oxides with perovskite structure .",
    "the @xmath4ness or the zero occupancy of tranistion metal @xmath5 cation is known chemically to favor ferroelectricity@xcite .",
    "hence , the availability of transition metal _ d_-electrons in the perovskite oxides necessary for magnetism , reduces the tendency for off - centering ferroelectric distortions@xcite making multiferroics relatively rare .",
    "how the ordering of @xmath6electronic spins of the @xmath5 cation influence ferroelectric or other competing structural instabilities has not yet been explored and understood .",
    "the coupling between magnetic ordering and structural instabilities is expected to involve interesting physics and is of direct relevance to technological applications@xcite such as multiple state memory elements and novel memory media .",
    "there are at least three families of high temperature biferroic materials .",
    "bi- based perovskite oxides , like bimno@xmath7 @xcite , bicro@xmath7@xcite , and bifeo@xmath7@xcite are known to be promising biferroics .",
    "ferroelectricity in these materials arises from the stereochemical activity of the @xmath8 lone pair electrons of bi .",
    "hexagonal rare earth manganates lnmno@xmath7 and inmno@xmath7 are biferroics which exhibit improper or geometric ferroelectricity@xcite .",
    "rare earth chromites lncro@xmath7 @xcite ( with ln = ho , er , tm , yb , lu or y ) have been recently shown to be biferroic ; ycro@xmath7 has been shown@xcite to exhibit canted antiferromagnetic behavior below 140 k and a ferroelectric transition around 473 k. similarly , lucro@xmath7 becomes a canted antiferromagnet below 115 k , and is ferroelectric below 488 k @xcite .",
    "the absence of any ferroelctricity in lacro@xmath7 , has been attributed to the large size of the la@xmath9 ion , in comparison with y@xmath9 .",
    "however , small values of polarization reported for these materials ( about 2@xmath10c/@xmath11 for ycro@xmath7@xcite and 6@xmath10c/@xmath11 of bifeo@xmath7@xcite ) inspite of large a - cation off - centering distortions remain a puzzle .",
    "more recently@xcite , a new concept of ` local non - centrosymmetry ' in ycro@xmath7 has been proposed to account for the small value of polarization observed .",
    "perovskite oxides are known to have many competing structural instabilities@xcite and this competition is further enriched by the magnetic instabilities .",
    "the coupling and competition between various magnetic and structural ordering can be partly responsible for weak ferroelectricity or the possibility of local non - centrosymmetry .",
    "our goal here is to investigate this issue through determination of various structural instabilities for different magnetic orderings , with a focus on rare earth chromites .",
    "we present results of detailed electronic structure and frozen phonon ( at the @xmath1 and r points ) calculations for a set of five materials ( lucro@xmath7 , ycro@xmath7 , lacro@xmath7 , bicro@xmath7 and yfeo@xmath7 ) in the cubic phase with three different magnetic orderings ( para- , ferro- and antiferromagnetic ) . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the methods used in calculations here . in section iii",
    ", we report results for structural energetics , the electronic density of states ( dos ) and the born effective charges ( bec ) for the cubic phase of these materials with different magnetic orderings . in section iv",
    ", we report results for structural instabilities in chromites and compare them with those in a related compound yfeo@xmath7 .",
    "since the many - electron correlations are important in magnetic oxides , we estimate their effects on the structural instabilities through use of the hubbard parameter u @xcite . using our results for structural instabilities , we show how certain nonpolar structural instabilities can cooperatively stabilize ferromagnetism . our work reveals how the structural instabilities of these biferroic oxides depend on the size of a - cation ( with the same b - cation ) , and a change in b - cation .",
    "we interpret the results using arguments based on superexchange@xcite , and the well - known goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite .",
    "finally , we summarize in section v.     direction , to represent g - type antiferroamgnetic ordering . ]",
    "our calculations are based on first - principles pseudopotential based density functional theory within a generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite as implemented in the pwscf package@xcite . the interaction between ions and electrons",
    "is approximated with ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite treating explicitly 11 electrons [ ( n-1)s@xmath12 ( n-1)p@xmath13 ( n-1)d@xmath14 and ns@xmath12 ] in the valence shell of lu(n=6 ) , la(n=6 ) and y(n=5 ) .",
    "we consider 6 valence electrons for oxygen [ 2s@xmath122p@xmath16 and 14 electrons for cr [ 3s@xmath123p@xmath133d@xmath174s@xmath14 ] .",
    "we used a plane wave basis with kinetic energy cut off of 25 ryd ( 150 ryd ) to represent wave functions ( density ) . for cubic structures",
    ", we sample the brillouin zone using a 5 @xmath19 5 @xmath19 5 monkhorst pack mesh@xcite , and a denser mesh ( 6 @xmath19 6 @xmath19 6 ) and higher energy cut - off ( 30 ryd ) for energy differences .",
    "phonon frequencies calculated with these larger parameters do not differ much from those calculated with a lower cut - off .",
    "we perform spin polarised calculations by initializing different spins on neighbouring magnetic ions ; for paramagnetic ordering we initialise a zero spin on cr ions .",
    "to represent antiferromagnetic ordering , the unit cell is doubled along the @xmath20 direction ( see fig[per ] ) . to investigate structural instabilities in the prototype cubic structure , we determine its dynamical matrix using frozen phonon calculations .",
    "we use a finite difference form of the first derivative to compute an element of the force constant matrix : @xmath21 where f@xmath22 is the hellman - feynman force acting on the _ i@xmath23 _ atom in @xmath24 direction , and , u@xmath25 the displacement of the _",

    "in order to represent g - type antiferromagnetic ordering which has been shown to be most favourable energetically , we use a unit cell doubled along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "we determine structural instabilities in this structure with different magnetic orderings .",
    "a single unit cell has 10 atoms which results in 30 phonon branches : 3 accoustic ( which have zero frequency at k=(0,0,0 ) ) and 27 optical , some of which are triply degenerate .",
    "we are interested mainly in optical modes with imaginary phonon frequencies corresponding to instabilities in the structure .",
    "doubling the unit cell along the @xmath20 direction , gives us access to zone boundary phonon modes ( r - point ) which form the dominant structural instabilities in this structure , along with the zone - center modes .",
    "in the paramagnetic phase , both ycro@xmath7 and lucro@xmath7 exhibit a zone center instability at 116.5 and 144.8 @xmath34 respectively , which is a polar mode ( with @xmath35 symmetry ) involving mainly the off centering of a - cation .",
    "this instability , however , is absent in lacro@xmath7 .",
    "we find two instabilities in the fm phase : @xmath35 and @xmath36 modes .",
    "the non - polar @xmath36 mode involves oxygen displacements only , and is strongly unstable in the fm phase .",
    "the @xmath35 mode involves the a - cation ( rare earth ion ) moving in a direction opposite to that of the oxygen cage and cr atom resulting in a ferroelectric polar structural distortion .",
    "note that the cr atom moves in the same direction as the oxygen ion , in contrast to the behavior of ti ion in batio@xmath7@xcite and pbtio@xmath7@xcite , but similar to the behavior of mn in bimno@xmath7@xcite and cr in bicro@xmath7 @xcite .    with afm spin arrangement , for lucro@xmath7 , we find three triply degenerate instabilities , at 339.5 @xmath37 , 145 @xmath37 and the weakest at around 60 @xmath37 .",
    "for ycro@xmath7 , the corresponding instabilities are at 309 @xmath37 , 140 @xmath37 and 80 @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the strongest instability ( at around 300 @xmath37 for the two materials ) has r@xmath38 symmetry and corresponds to rotation of the corner connected oxygen octahedra .",
    "the next instability is the ferroelectric @xmath35 mode ( around 140 @xmath37 ) . the weakest instability ( 60 @xmath37 for lucro@xmath7 and 80 @xmath37 for ycro@xmath7 ) has r@xmath39 symmetry and involves displacement of the a - cations ( lu and y for our case ) and small oxygen displacements ; these are antiparallel in neighbouring unit cells . in lacro@xmath7",
    ", we find only two triply degenerate instabilities . the first instability at around 220 @xmath37 corresponding to the oxygen rotations ( the r@xmath38 mode ) and the second close to 18 @xmath37 having @xmath35 symmetry ( see fig [ modes ] ) .",
    "point phonon modes : @xmath35 and @xmath36 modes ]    for the rare earth chromites studied in this paper , unstable r - point modes in the afm phase do not change significantly with magnetic ordering . @xmath1 point instabilities in contrast depend strongly on magnetic ordering . only the high frequency phonons are affected in going from para- to antiferromagnetic phase and all @xmath35 and @xmath40 modes are softer in the fm phase .",
    "the @xmath36 mode which brings about a significant change in the cr - o - cr as well as o - cr - o bond angle shows a spectacular change with magnetic ordering .",
    "this mode , highly unstable in the ferromagnetic phase ( at around 200 cm @xmath41 ) becomes stable at around 50 @xmath34 with para- and antiferromagnetic orderings .",
    "this behavior , although not as pronounced , is also seen for this mode in lacro@xmath7 . the r@xmath38 instability , also involving a change in the cr - o - cr bond angle , is not affected by the change in magnetic ordering possibly because the o - cr - o bond angle still remains unchanged .",
    "another significant change is observed for the r@xmath38 mode , which involves a movement of the two b - cations ( cr in our case ) in opposite directions .",
    "after introduction of spin - polarization , the r@xmath38 mode ( close to 250 @xmath34 for pm phase ) becomes more stable at around 400 @xmath34 for the fm and afm phases .",
    "we compare our results with the bi - based biferroic chromite , bicro@xmath7 and find a similar behavior of the @xmath36 mode here as well .",
    "we thus attribute this behavior to the b cation ( cr ion for the chromites ) and expect it to be their general behavior . to interpret the general trend in phonon frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ phonon ] ) , the following rules apply :    \\1 .",
    "the modes which involve a change in the cr - o - cr bond angle ( as well as o - cr - o bond angle ) are more stable in the afm phases and are relatively less , or unstable , in the fm phase .",
    "this behaviour is seen in the @xmath36 and @xmath35 modes for lucro@xmath7 .",
    "\\2 . secondly , the modes which involve a change in the cr - o bond length tend to harden with the introduction of spin polarization , as observed for the r@xmath38 and r@xmath42 modes .     with different magnetic orderings .",
    "insets show similar curves for lacro@xmath7 and bicro@xmath7.,width=302 ]    in order to study the effect of change in b - cation ( see fig [ yfecr ] ) , we compare instabilities in yfeo@xmath7 with ycro@xmath7 .",
    "we find that a change in magnetic ordering has an opposite effect on the unstable modes involving a change in fe - o - fe bond angle .",
    "a spectacular change is the r@xmath43 mode , an oxygen breathing mode , which softens in the fm phase as compared to the pm and afm phases .",
    "the @xmath36 mode also shows a different behaviour , showing a stabilization with fm ordering .",
    "these differences are due to the filled e@xmath44 orbitals in fe@xmath9 , which are unoccupied in cr@xmath9 , leading to a much stronger superexchange interaction mediated by the e@xmath44 orbitals , and have a different geometry dependence",
    ".     and yfeo@xmath7.,width=321 ]      the spectacular change in the frequency of the @xmath36 mode with fm ordering , prompts us to discuss whether ferromagnetism can be stabilized in these chromites by varying the cr - o - cr bond angle .",
    "since the @xmath36 mode is unstable only in the fm phase , we want to study the effect of freezing in a distortion of this mode .",
    "we have calculated the total energy as a function of @xmath36 displacements in the @xmath20 and @xmath45 directions , for the fm and afm phases ( see fig [ cross_over ] ) . for lucro@xmath7",
    ", we observe a crossover , at a displacement of 0.407 @xmath28 , beyond which the fm phase is energetically favoured . the cr - o - cr bond angle , at the crossover point is found to be 153@xmath46 , which is significantly different from , the value suggested by goodenough and kanamori for ferromagnetic superexchange interaction ( 130@xmath46 ) in 1951 .",
    "on examining the density of states beyond the crossover point ( see fig . [ crossoverdos ] ) , we find more significant hybridization between cr and oxygens for the fm phase . secondly , the fm phase so stabilized is found to be insulating .     mode for fm and afm orderings in lucro@xmath7 .",
    "fm becomes more stable than the afm state for rhombohedral distortions greater than 0.407 @xmath28.,width=302 ]     displacement of 0.407 @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ cross_over ] , where the fm state is more stable).,width=245 ]      as mentioned earlier in the paper , the lda+u method has been successfully applied to describe the electronic structure of sytems containing localized _",
    "d _ and _ f _ electrons where lda sometimes leads to incorrect results@xcite , and recently it has been applied to obtain structural parameters that are in better agreement with experimental results than lda or gga . @xcite . in this work",
    ", we use a value of u = 3.0 ev , adapted from work on full structural optimization of bicro@xmath7 @xcite . with the introduction of correlations through u parameter , we find that the modes in fm phase do not change significantly . our results for ycro@xmath7 ( see fig [ ycr_plus_u ] ) bear that only @xmath36 , r@xmath43 and r@xmath42 modes are noticeably affected .",
    "correlations lead to softening of the r@xmath43 and r@xmath42 modes by 50 @xmath34 , and tend to harden the @xmath36 mode in the pm phase . in an afm spin arrangement , these r - point modes are hardened by approximately 20 @xmath34 and the @xmath36 instability is softened .     with different magnetic orderings .",
    "for each mode , data on the left of the vertical dashed line represents estimates with gga and the data on the right represents estimates with gga+u ( u=3.0 ev).,width=283 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have determined structural instabilities of lacro@xmath7 , lucro@xmath7 , ycro@xmath7 and bicro@xmath7 in their cubic perovskite structures with different magnetic orderings .",
    "our finding that the g - type antiferromagnetic ordering is most stable can be explained with superexchange arguments .",
    "ferroelectric structural instabilities in the cubic structures involve a - cation ( lu or y ) displacements , as indicated by the eigenvectors of the ferroelectric @xmath35 modes and an anomalous bec of the a - cation .",
    "we find that certain phonon frequencies depend sensitively on magnetic ordering : the modes involving a change in bond - angle are stable ( harder ) with the antiferro- and paramagnetic ordering than in the fm state ; on the other hand , the modes involving a change in cr - o bond length are softer in the paramagnetic phase and comparable in the fm and afm states .",
    "the @xmath36 oxygen mode brings about a significant change in the cr - o - cr bond angle and is highly unstable in the fm phase , and corresponding structural distortion leads to stabilization of ferromagnetic ordering in these chromites . among the competing structural instabilities the antiferrodistortive instability ( @xmath47 mode )",
    "is the strongest .",
    "electron correlations are found to have little effect on the unstable phonon modes , but result in a slight change in a few of the stable phonon modes in the pm phase .",
    "we note that the effects of magnetic ordering on structural instabilities are quite different ( in fact , opposite sometimes ) in yfeo@xmath7 with respect to chromites , and a more detailed study is required to understand such couplings in ferrites .",
    "origin of small polarization and/or local non - centrosymmetry@xcite is probably from the relatively weak ferroelectric instabilities and their competition with various structural magnetic instabilities , and our work should be useful in formulating a phenomenological analysis of the same .",
