    "gravitational wave bursts@xcite are short ( less than one second ) transients of gravitational radiation with poorly known waveforms .",
    "they are one of the distinct types of signals ligo@xcite and other interferometric and resonant mass detectors@xcite are pursuing .",
    "a search for such signals is generally a time - frequency search , since time and frequency information of the candidate events are essential for a multi - detector coincidence analysis as well as for relating events to astrophysical sources .",
    "one of the well established tools for such an analysis is the short time fourier transform ( also known as the windowed fourier transform ) developed by denis gabor in 1946 .",
    "this approach applies standard fourier transforms to short windowed segments of the original time series to create a uniform time - frequency map with a time resolution and frequency resolution that depends upon the window s duration .",
    "however , it is impossible to pick a window duration appropriate for all frequencies .",
    "low frequency signals require long duration windows to accumulate sufficient frequency information , while high frequency signals are better isolated in time using short duration windows .",
    "time and frequency localization of transient signals is therefore not easily achieved with the short time fourier transform .",
    "here we have also assumed that burst waveforms are limited in @xmath0 ; that is , that the number of oscillations fall within a particular range regardless of frequency .    in this introductory methods paper",
    "we explore multiresolution techniques for the detection of transients that rely on the dyadic wavelet transform@xcite and the constant @xmath0 transform@xcite .",
    "both methods search for a statistically significant excess of signal power in the time - frequency plane .",
    "however , contrary to existing excess power searches@xcite , we implement a bank of filters that produce a logarithmic tiling of the time - frequency plane .",
    "this provides increasing time resolution at higher frequencies and thus naturally addresses the time - frequency localization problem .",
    "this paper outlines these new methods and is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : bursts ] defines a representation independent parameterization of gravitational - wave bursts and defines an optimal signal to noise ratio , which motivates our use of a multiresolution approach .",
    "section  [ sec : wavelet ] presents the basics of the continuous and discrete wavelet transforms , while section  [ sec : q ] presents the continuous and discrete @xmath0 transform as a modification of the short time fourier transform .",
    "section  [ sec : lpef ] demonstrates how linear prediction can be used to whiten background noise prior to transform analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : events ] describes methods for the selection of significant events from the output of the proposed algorithms , and section  [ sec : efficiency ] presents preliminary detection efficiencies of our search algorithms applied to gaussian and sine - gaussian bursts injected into simulated ligo detector noise .",
    "tuning and application of the proposed algorithms to search for a broader set of signals in data from the first ligo science runs is currently in progress .",
    "to further motivate the development of multiresolution techniques , we first consider the parameterization and detectability of gravitational - wave bursts that are well localized in both time and frequency .",
    "the more general case of non - localized bursts can be treated as a superposition of localized bursts .",
    "an arbitrary gravitational wave burst may be represented in both the time - domain and the frequency - domain by the fourier transform pair @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for bursts that are square - integrable",
    ", we may also define a representation independent characteristic squared amplitude , @xmath3 for bursts that are well localized in both time and frequency , it is then meaningful to define a central time , central frequency , duration , and bandwidth : @xmath4 it can be shown that the duration and bandwidth , when defined in this way , obey an uncertainty relation of the form , @xmath5 which we will also take as an approximate criterion for bursts that are well localized in the time - frequency plane .",
    "finally , we define the dimensionless quality factor of a burst , @xmath6 which for well localized bursts , is simply a measure of the burst s aspect ratio in the time - frequency plane .",
    "in general , a search algorithm for gravitational - wave bursts projects the data under test onto a basis constructed to span the space of plausible bursts .",
    "the optimal measurement occurs when a member of this basis exactly matches a gravitational - wave burst . in this case",
    "we achieve a signal to noise ratio , @xmath7 , which for narrowband bursts or a flat detector noise spectrum , is simply the ratio of the total energy content of the signal , @xmath8 , to the in - band one - sided power spectral density , @xmath9 , of the detector noise : @xmath10 thus , @xmath11 , which has units of strain per square root hz , is a convenient quantity for evaluating the detectability of narrowband bursts since it is directly comparable to the amplitude spectral density of detector noise .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the above signal to noise ratio is only achieved when a member of the measurement basis closely matches the signal in the time - frequency plane .",
    "otherwise , the measurement encompasses either too little signal or too much noise , resulting in a loss in the measured signal to noise ratio .",
    "since bursts are naturally characterized by their @xmath0 , we therefore choose to tile the time frequency plane by selecting a measurement basis which directly targets bursts within a finite range of @xmath0 .",
    "this naturally leads to a logarithmic tiling of the time frequency plane in which individual measurement pixels are well localized signals , all with the same @xmath0 .",
    "in the preceding section , we motivate a search for bursts which projects the data under test onto a basis of well localized bursts of constant @xmath0 .",
    "the wavelet transform@xcite by construction satisfies these requirements , and is defined by the integral , @xmath12 where the wavelet , @xmath13 , is a time - localized function of zero average .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 are evaluated continuously over times , @xmath15 , and scales , @xmath16 . our ability to resolve in time and frequency",
    "is then determined by the properties @xmath13 assumes at each scale . at large scale",
    ", @xmath13 is highly dilated yielding improved frequency resolution at the expense of time resolution . at small scale",
    ", we achieve good time resolution with large uncertainty in frequency .",
    "however , since the number of oscillations is fixed , the resulting @xmath0 is constant over all scales",
    ".      for the case of discrete data , a computationally efficient algorithm exists for calculating wavelet coefficients over scales that vary as powers of two : @xmath17 .",
    "this is the dyadic wavelet transform , which can be implemented for a limited family of wavelets using conjugate mirror filters .",
    "the filters consist of a high pass filter , @xmath18 , and low pass filter , @xmath19 , which can be applied in a cascade to obtain the wavelet coefficients . beginning with the original time series , @xmath20 , of length @xmath21 ,",
    "two sequences of length @xmath22 are obtained by application of the high pass and low pass filters followed by down - sampling . the sequence of detail coefficients , @xmath23 , and approximation coefficients , @xmath24 ,",
    "are defined at each level , @xmath25 , of the decomposition by @xmath26 the detail coefficients for scale @xmath16 , where @xmath27 , calculated in this manner are the same as the wavelet coefficients obtained from equation  [ eqn : cwt ] .",
    "if @xmath21 is a power of two , so that @xmath28 , the final approximation sequence will be @xmath29 .",
    "the simplest dyadic wavelet is the haar function : @xmath30 the corresponding high pass and low pass filters are @xmath31 / \\sqrt{2 } \\hfill \\mbox{and } \\hfill \\hat{l}^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize haar } } = [ + 1 , + 1 ] / \\sqrt{2 } , \\hspace{0.5in}\\ ] ] from which we see that the detail coefficients are related to the differences of each pair of points in the parent series , while the approximation coefficients are related to the averages of each pair .    a technique called wavelet packets can be used to further decompose the detail coefficients into smaller frequency subbands of higher @xmath0 .",
    "the _ waveburst_@xcite search method currently implements a full wavelet packet decomposition which results in a uniform time - frequency plane with time - frequency cell sizes equivalent to those of the highest scale in the dyadic decomposition .",
    "it is possible , however , to choose a different subset of the wavelet packet coefficients which approximate a more constant @xmath0 time - frequency plane by further decomposing the detail coefficents only a constant number of times at each scale .",
    "this would give much more flexibility to detect high @xmath0 signals which do not match well to the mother wavelet @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath0 transform is a modification of the standard short time fourier transform in which the analysis window duration varies inversely with frequency .",
    "it is similar in design to the continuous wavelet transform and also permits efficient computation for the case of discrete data .",
    "however , since reconstruction of the data sequence is not a concern , we permit violation of the zero mean requirement .",
    "in addition , the discrete @xmath0 transform is not constrained to frequencies which are related by powers of two .",
    "we begin by projecting the sequence under test , @xmath32 , onto windowed complex sinusoids of frequency @xmath33 : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is a time - domain window centered on time @xmath36 with a duration that is inversely proportional to the frequency under consideration@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 transform may also be expressed in an alternative form@xcite , which allows for efficient computation .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 transform at a specific frequency is obtained by a standard fourier transform of the original time series , a shift in frequency , multiplication by the appropriate frequency domain window function , and an inverse fourier transform .",
    "the benefit of equation  [ eqn : qtransform : alt ] is that the fourier transform of the original time series need only be computed once .",
    "we then perform the inverse fourier transform only for the logarithmically spaced frequencies that we are interested in .",
    "we may also adapt the @xmath0 transform to the case of discrete data . in this case ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : qtransform ] takes the form : @xmath38 = \\sum_{n = 0}^{n - 1 } x[n ] w[n - m , k ] e^{-",
    "n k / n}.\\ ] ] as was the case for the continuous @xmath0 transform , we may express the discrete @xmath0 transform in the alternative form : @xmath39 = \\sum_{l = 0}^{n - 1 } \\tilde{x}[l + k ] \\tilde{w}^{*}[l , k ] e^{+ i 2 \\pi m l / n}.\\ ] ] this allows us to take advantage of the computational efficiency of the fast fourier transform for both the initial transform as well as the subsequent inverse transforms for each desired value of @xmath40 .    due to the implementation of the discrete @xmath0 transform in equation  [ eqn : dqt : alt ] ,",
    "the window function is most conveniently defined in the frequency domain . in particular , we choose a frequency domain hanning window , which has finite support in the frequency domain while still providing good time - frequency localization .",
    "in this section , we present linear prediction@xcite as a tool for whitening gravitational - wave data prior to analysis by both the dyadic wavelet transform and the discrete @xmath0 transform . for both transforms , the statistical distribution of transform coefficients",
    "is well known for the case of input white noise .",
    "whitened data therefore permits a single predefined test for significance , which greatly simplifies the subsequent identification of candidate bursts .",
    "we also note that linear predictive whitening is a necessary component of current cross - correlation@xcite and time - domain@xcite searches for gravitational - wave bursts in ligo data .",
    "linear prediction assumes that the @xmath41 sample of a sequence is well modeled by a linear combination of the previous @xmath42 samples .",
    "we thus define the predicted sequence , @xmath43 = \\sum_{m=1}^{m } c[m ] x[n - m],\\ ] ] and the corresponding prediction error sequence , @xmath44 = x[n ] - \\hat{x}[n].\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath45 $ ] are then chosen to minimize the mean squared prediction error , @xmath46 |^2,\\ ] ] over a representative training sequence of length @xmath21 . assuming that @xmath47 $ ] is a stationary stochastic process , this results in the well known yule - walker@xcite equations , @xmath48 c[m ] = r[k ] \\qquad \\mbox{for } \\qquad 1 \\leq k \\leq m,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 $ ] is the autocorrelation of the training sequence @xmath47 $ ] evaluated at lag @xmath40 . in practice , we choose the biased autocorrelation estimate , @xmath50 = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{n = |k|}^{n } x[n ] x[n - |k|],\\ ] ] which guarantees the existence of a solution to the yule - walker equations .    when this process is applied to gravitational - wave data , the resulting prediction error sequence is composed primarily of sample to sample uncorrelated white noise .",
    "however , it also contains any unpredictable transient signals which were present in the original data sequence .",
    "thus , the prediction error sequence is the whitened data sequence which we desire to subject to further analysis by the algorithms proposed in this paper .",
    "we therefore define the linear predictor error filter as the @xmath51 order finite impulse response filter , which when applied to a data sequence , @xmath47 $ ] , returns the corresponding prediction error sequence , @xmath52 $ ] : @xmath53 = \\sum_{m=0}^{m } b[m ] x[n - m].\\ ] ]    the choice of the filter order , @xmath42 , is then determined by the measurement resolution of subsequent analysis . for a given filter order , the resulting prediction error sequence will be uncorrelated on time scales shorter than @xmath42 samples . in the frequency domain",
    ", this corresponds to a spectrum which is white on frequency scales greater than a characteristic bandwidth , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the sample frequency of the data .",
    "thus , we can whiten to any desired frequency resolution by selecting the appropriate filter order , @xmath42 . in practice",
    ", we simply choose the minimum filter order which is sufficient for the subsequent analysis .",
    "for the training length , @xmath21 , we choose to train over times which are long compared to the typical gravitational - wave bursts we are searching for .    [ 0.8 ] .",
    "in addition , the right hand plot shows the effect of the same linear prediction error filter when applied to a simulated gravitational - wave burst injected into the data . in this case",
    ", we inject a 235 hz sine - gaussian with a @xmath0 of 12.7 and signal to noise ratio of 20 as described in section  [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "note the absence of a time delay between the whitened and unwhitened burst.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] [ 0.8 ] .",

    "the construction of the zero phase filter is carried out in the frequency domain , where it is also possible to take the square root of the resulting frequency domain filter before transforming back to the time domain .",
    "an example application of zero - phase linear prediction to sample gravitational - wave data and a simulated gravitational - wave burst is shown in figure  [ fig : lpef ] .",
    "we now seek to identify statistically significant events in the resulting dyadic wavelet transform and discrete @xmath0 transform coefficients .",
    "we assume that linear predictive whitening ( section  [ sec : lpef ] ) has been applied to the data prior to the dyadic wavelet transform . then , according to the central limit theorem , for a sufficiently large scale , @xmath25 , the wavelet coefficients , @xmath23 , within the scale will approach a zero - mean gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore define the sequence of squared normalized coefficients , or normalized pixel energies at scale @xmath58 , @xmath59 which is chi - squared distributed with one degree of freedom ( figure  [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "it is then simply a matter of thresholding on the energy of individual pixels , @xmath60 , to identify statistical outliers .",
    "we may also choose to cluster nearby pixels to better detect bursts which deviate from the dyadic wavelet tiling of the time - frequency plane .",
    "for a randomly selected cluster @xmath61 of @xmath21 pixels , we define the total cluster energy , @xmath62 which is also chi - square distributed , but with @xmath21 degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore possible to select a threshold energy to achieve a desired white noise false event rate . alternatively",
    ", sharp transients may also be detected by simply searching for vertical clusters of pixels within the top @xmath63 percent of pixel energies in each scale .",

    ", we may also consider clusters of @xmath21 pixels and select a threshold energy in order to achieve a desired white noise false event rate .",
    "however in this case , the cluster energy is chi - square distributed with @xmath67 degrees of freedom .    to efficiently detect bursts over a range of @xmath0 , we perform multiple @xmath0 transforms , each of which produces a time - frequency plane tiled for a particular @xmath0 within our range of interest . to best estimate the parameters of candidate bursts , we then select the most significant non - overlapping pixels among all @xmath0 planes using a simple exclusion algorithm .",
    "pixels are considered in decreasing order of significance and any pixel which overlaps in time or frequency with a more significant pixel is discarded .",
    "thus , for each localized candidate burst , only the single pixel which best represents the burst parameters is reported .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility of clustering pixels from non - localized bursts , since the pixels which pass both the initial significance threshold as well as the exclusion algorithm will represent the strong localized features of such bursts . reducing a non - localized burst to its strong , localized features has the additional benefit of a much tighter time - frequency coincidence criterion when multiple detectors are used .",
    "finally , we evaluate the detection efficiencies of the proposed algorithms over simulated ligo noise . the simulated data are composed of line sources and gaussian distributed white noise passed through shaping filters to produce a power spectrum which matches the typical h1 detector noise spectrum during the second ligo science run@xcite .",
    "assuming optimal orientation , we evaluate the detection efficiency for each waveform at various @xmath11 by injecting 256 such bursts at random times into the simulated data ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the simulated data are first filtered by a 6th order 64 hz butterworth high pass filter followed by a linear prediction error filter with whitening resolution of 16 hz .",
    "however , we do not model the non - stationary behavior of real ligo noise , which largely determines the false event rate of existing search algorithms . the algorithms considered in this paper",
    "are equally applicable to the identification of statistically significant transient events in auxiliary interferometer or environmental data .",
    "so , they may also prove useful for identifying potential vetoes .     transform ( right ) .",

    "the filtered data are passed through the discrete wavelet transform and event selection algorithm as described in section  [ sec : events : wavelet ] for a false event rate of 0.5 hz .",
    "we allow clusters to be composed of a single pixel , or a combination of two pixels adjacent or overlapping in time and adjacent in scale for scales , @xmath25 , of 5 , 6 , and 7 . for @xmath68 s of 0.35 , 0.71 , and 1.41",

    "the discrete @xmath0 transform is applied to the whitened data with approximately 75 percent pixel overlap to search for single pixel bursts within the frequency band 644096 hz and with @xmath0 s in the vicinity of 10.6 , 14.1 , and 17.7 .",

    "this allowed us to measure the algorithms efficiency at a fixed false alarm rate of o(1hz ) .",
    "the results are encouraging and we are continuing the computation for mapping the efficiency of the algorithms as a function of their false alarm rate .",
    "needless to say , even if the shaped ligo noise with some line features that we used for our simulation is a step forward , it does remain unrealistic .",
    "real interferometric data have richer line structure , non - stationary and non - gaussian character that may be far from our assumptions ; at the same time though , it is extremely hard to simulate .",
    "all of these make the perfomance estimates that we made using our simulation model optimistic . the use though of mathematically well described noise allows the straightforward reproduction and comparison of our results with other methods .",
    "an end - to - end pipeline using the aforementioned methods for whitening and transient - finding on data collected by the ligo instruments is currently in development .",
    "this will provide the ultimate test of the performance of the algorithms and will be reported separately within the context of the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) data analysis ongoing research .",
