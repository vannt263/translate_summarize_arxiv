    "entanglement , mixedness and nonlocality are among the main properties describing the quantum features of a composite system .",
    "entanglement is linked to quantum correlations @xcite and for a two - qubit state can be quantified , e.g. , by concurrence @xmath0 @xcite , while for a multipartite system its characterization remains an open problem .",
    "mixedness , namely how much the state of a quantum system is far from being pure , can be quantified by the purity @xmath1 ( linked to the linear entropy ) or by the von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "nonlocality describes the part of quantum correlations which can not be reproduced by any classical local model @xcite .",
    "it is typically characterized by combination of correlations averages , named bell function , violating some bell inequality @xcite .",
    "the value obtained for the bell function depends on the state of the system and on some parameters determined by the experimental settings .",
    "it may happen that , for some of these settings , the value obtained for the bell function does not violate the bell inequality .",
    "it is therefore appropriate , in general , to fix the external parameters to obtain the maximum possible value @xmath2 for the bell function . in this sense ,",
    "the maximum of the bell function @xmath2 individuates at best the presence of nonlocality @xcite .",
    "all of these quantifiers may be obtained by measurements on the system .",
    "the properties they represent play an important role in quantum information science , such as in the realization of device - independent and security - proof quantum key distribution protocols @xcite . in applicative contexts",
    ", it has been shown that also states nonviolating any bell inequality can be used for teleportation @xcite and that every entangled state shows some hidden nonlocality @xcite which may be exploited using local filtering @xcite .",
    "the values of the three quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are related and connections among pairs of them have been widely investigated .",
    "these connections are far from being trivial .",
    "for example , although for pure states the presence of entanglement implies nonlocality @xcite , on the contrary for mixed states a given amount of entanglement does not necessarily guarantee violation of a bell inequality @xcite .",
    "in particular , for bipartite systems , a range of possible bell inequality violations corresponds to a certain amount of entanglement @xcite , while states with a different degree of entanglement can violate a bell inequality of the same amount @xcite .",
    "the connection between entanglement and mixedness has been investigated often in the concurrence - purity plane and maximally entangled mixed two - qubit states for assigned mixedness have been identified @xcite .",
    "their dependence on the quantifiers has also been pointed out @xcite .",
    "moreover , the entanglement - mixedness relation has been analyzed for some dynamical systems in the presence of environmental noise @xcite .    for",
    "what concerns the connection among entanglement , mixedness and nonlocality , it has been conjectured that the more mixed a system is , the more entanglement is needed to violate a bell inequality to the same amount @xcite .",
    "however , there are states having the same amount of entanglement and mixedness but different values of the bell function @xcite . relations between entanglement , mixedness and bell function have been given analytically for a restrict @xcite , and numerically for a more general @xcite class of states .",
    "in particular , there are regions of the concurrence - linear entropy plane where , given concurrence and linear entropy , two families of states can be discriminated : all states from one family violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form of bell inequality while all states from the other family satisfy it .",
    "one may therefore ask if more general relations involving all these quantities may be put forward .",
    "finally , the variety of relations among entanglement , mixedness and nonlocality in the state space has not yet been examined in a dynamical context , e.g. , by following them in time for a quantum system interacting with its surroundings . in this case their time evolution , as characterized by the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , can be rather complex , depending on the structure of the environment and on the form of the interactions .",
    "in fact , typically decay of both entanglement and nonlocal correlations are expected , even though revivals or trapping of them may occur as a consequence of memory effects @xcite and/or of interactions among parts of the system @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , mixedness typically increases during the evolution tending to different asymptotic values .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the possible connections among quantifiers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in a dynamical context , and discuss them for a wide class of two - qubit states . to this purpose",
    "we introduce the three - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 parameter space as a tool to analyze the dynamics of these relations , choosing the paradigmatic open quantum system of two qubits in a common structured reservoir .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 space appears to be particularly suitable to describe the dynamical richness of entanglement , mixedness and nonlocality relations in such a system .",
    "here we investigate the complex relation among entanglement , mixedness and nonlocality in a specific dynamical context .",
    "as said before , we introduce a tool : the concurrence - purity - bell function ( @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 ) parameter space .",
    "the state of the system and its evolution are represented , respectively , by a point of this space and the trajectory it draws with time . to begin with ,",
    "we give the expressions of concurrence , purity and bell function for a wide class of quantum states .      here",

    "such a x structure for the density matrix moreover arises in a wide variety of physical situations @xcite .",
    "a further remarkable aspect of these x states is that , under various kinds of dynamics , the initial x structure is maintained during the evolution @xcite . in particular , this is the case for the model we shall investigate hereafter ; this justifies our choice of this class of quantum states .    for x states of eq .",

    "the reservoir is modeled as an infinite sum of harmonic oscillators and its properties are described through a lorentzian spectral distribution @xmath34 where the parameter @xmath35 defines the spectral width of the coupling and @xmath36 is related to the decay of the excited state of the qubit in the markovian limit of flat spectrum ( spontaneous emission rate ) .",
    "the ideal cavity limit ( no losses ) is obtained for @xmath37 .",

    "entanglement dynamics has been studied for a large class of initial states in ref .",
    "such a system exhibits a rich dynamics due to the memory effects of the non - markovian environment and the reservoir - mediated interaction between the qubits .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 dynamical relation in this physical configuration .",

    "the separation between the branches depends on the losses of the system .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that for a wider lorentzian spectral distribution ( worse cavity ) the branches become more separated and they reach lower values in the @xmath2 axis .",
    "differently , they tend to coincide for a perfect cavity ( single mode reservoir ) .",

    "[ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "now , a completely new dynamical feature appears : the curve surfaces from the @xmath44 plane in a region of small concurrence and high purity ( branch 2 ) .",
    "this behavior follows from the fact that when the system is almost pure even a small amount of entanglement induces the appearance of nonlocality .",
    "after such a revival of purity and nonlocality , the curve sinks again and reappears on the space region with smaller purity ( branch 3 ) .",
    "however , the system does not pass through the same @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 points of the first branch , but it traces a new branch close to the first one ( branch 3 )",
    ". successively , once again decoherence effects due to the environment lead to deterioration of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and a new branch appears ( branch 4 ) .",
    "the high non - markovianity of the reservoir again causes bell violation on the high purity / small concurrence region of space ( branch 5 ) .",
    "the behavior continues in a similar way and the point draws new branches until a time after which no violation occurs anymore .",

    "the nontrivial connection among the quantifiers of these properties , namely concurrence @xmath0 , purity @xmath1 and the maximum of bell function @xmath2 in the state space has been studied in a dynamical context .",
    "two qubits have been assumed to be embedded in a non - markovian common reservoir at zero temperature .",
    "common reservoir - mediated interaction and memory effects induce , with different intensities , revivals of all the three quantities .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 `` parameter '' space has been introduced and exploited for the description of the relations among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the two - qubit reduced dynamics .    for an initial two - excitation bell state",
    ", it has been shown that the system draws a multi - branch curve in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 space .",
    "projection of this curve on two - dimensional spaces clearly shows the absence of one - to - one correspondence between couples of the quantifiers @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this dynamical feature is maintained even in the limit of perfect cavity suffering no losses .",
    "a comparison with the case of independent reservoirs , where this correspondence between couples of the quantifiers occurs , has been made evidencing the role of the common reservoir - mediated interaction between qubits as responsible of the lack of such correspondence .",
    "the search of classes of states where a closed relation among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 holds , has led us to look for general connections among these quantifiers .",
    "on the basis of known relations between concurrence and maximum of bell function in the pure state case , an extended relation between all the three quantifiers for a wide class of mixed states has been given .",
    "a remainder , vanishing in the limit of pure state , has been introduced and its explicit form given for four different regions identified by the quantum state under investigation .",
    "this term could play a role to explain the complex and not well understood relation among all these quantities .",
    "moreover we have shown that , for the class of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) , a closed relation among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 exists .    in the final part of the paper",
    "we have reconsidered our dynamical model , showing that if the two qubits are initially prepared in the one - excitation bell state ( super - radiant state ) , differently from the two - excitation case , a one - to - one correspondence between any couple of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 occurs .",
    "this results in a single - valued relation represented by a one - branch curve in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 space which is drawn back and forth by the system . in this case",
    "we have a physical configuration in which a closed analytical relation among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be written .",
    "we have moreover shown that the system evolves maintaining the mems density matrix structure .",
    "therefore this physical configuration may be seen as a suitable setup for mems generation .",
