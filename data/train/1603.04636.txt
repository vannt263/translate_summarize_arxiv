    "a broad class of materials exhibit a dual response when subjected to an external tress . for",
    "low applied stresses they behave as solids ( loosely speaking they may deform but they do not flow ) but , if the stress exceeds a critical threshold generally referred to as the _ `` yield stress '' _ , they behave as fluids ( typically non - newtonian ) and a macroscopic flow is observed .",
    "this distinct class of materials has been termed as _ `` yield stress fluids''_. during the past several decades one could notice an increasing level of interest of both theoreticians and experimentalists in yield stress .",
    "this has a two - fold motivation . from a practical standpoint ,",
    "such materials have found a significant number of applications in several industries ( which include food , cosmetical , pharmaceutical , oil field engineering , etc . ) and they are encountered in daily life in various forms such as food pastes , hair gels and emulsions , cement , mud etc .. more recently , hydrogels which exhibit a yield stress have found a number of future promising applications including targeted drug delivery @xcite , contact lenses , noninvasive intervertebral disc repair @xcite and tissue engineering @xcite .    from a fundamental standpoint ,",
    "yield stress materials continue triggering intensive debates and posing difficult challenges to both theoreticians and experimentalists from various communities : soft matter physics , rheology , physical chemistry and applied mathematics .",
    "the progress in understanding the flow behaviour of yield stress materials made the object of several review papers @xcite .",
    "the best known debate concerning the yield stress materials is undoubtedly that related to the very existence of a `` true '' yield stress behaviour @xcite . during the past two decades , however , a number of innovative improvements in the rheometric equipment made possible measurements of torques as small as @xmath0 and rates of deformation as small as @xmath1 ) .",
    "such accurate rheological measurements proved unequivocally the existence of a true yielding behaviour @xcite .",
    "the physics of the yielding process itself on the other hand remains elusive .",
    "the macroscopic response of yield stress fluids subjected to an external stress @xmath2 has been classically described by the herschel - bulkely model @xcite :    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the yield stress , @xmath5 is the rate of shear , i.e. , the rate at which the material is being deformed , @xmath2 is the macroscopically applied stress ( the external forcing parameter ) , @xmath6 is a so - called consistency parameter that sets the viscosity scale in the flowing state and @xmath7 is the power law index which characterises the degree of shear thinning of the viscosity beyond the yield point .    in spite of its wide use by rheologists , fluid dynamicists and engineers ,",
    "the herschel - bulkley model ( and its regularised variants , e.g. papanastasiou @xcite ) is in fact applicable only for a limited number of yield stress materials , sufficiently far from the solid - fluid transition , i.e.  when @xmath8 , and in the conditions of a steady state forcing , i.e.   when a constant external stress @xmath2 is applied over a long period of time .",
    "thixotropy , which may be loosely understood alternative definitions . ] as a time dependence of the rheological parameters which results from a competition between destruction and rejuvenation of the soft material units subjected to stress , is considered to be a major reason for the departure from this simple yielding picture @xcite .",
    "it has been recently suggested that a number of difficulties concerning the yielding behaviour of yield stress materials could be solved if a clear distinction between thixotropic and non - thixotropic yield stress fluids is made @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that a clear departure from the herschel - bulkley behaviour can be observed even for non - thixotropic yield stress fluids such as the carbopol gels particularly during either controlled stressed rheological tests @xcite or hydrodynamically _ `` simple '' _ flow problems such as a creeping motion of a spherical object @xcite , the unsteady laminar pipe flow @xcite or the emergence of the rayleigh - bnard convection , @xcite in a yield stress fluid heated from below .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "several phenomenological macroscopic models have been proposed @xcite which have a general form :    @xmath9 \\label{eq : structuralmodels}\\ ] ]    the particular feature of these models is that they describe the temporal evolution of a microstructural parameter @xmath10 as a function of the applied stress and a number of parameters @xmath11 .",
    "part of these parameters describe the kinetics of the destruction / restructuration of the material and are difficult ( or impossible ! ) to measure .",
    "the rest of the parameters are measurable via adequate macroscopic rheological tests ( flow ramps , oscillatory measurements , creep / relaxation tests etc . ) .",
    "thus , as the applied stress is increased , @xmath12 varies smoothly from @xmath13 ( the entire volume of material is in a solid state ) to @xmath14 ( the entire volume of material is in a fluid state ) and the combined solid and fluid rheological responses are accounted for accordingly into a constitutive relation .",
    "finally , the problem is reduced to a system of coupled equation which can be solved either analytically if the structural evolution equation is sufficiently simple ( see for example the @xmath15 model proposed by coussot in @xcite , @xcite ) or numerically .",
    "such approaches have several clear indisputable advantages and have contributed significantly to our current understanding of yield stress materials :    1 .    as opposed to the bingham and the herschel - bulkley models which predict an abrupt and discontinuous solid - fluid transition when @xmath16 jumps from @xmath13 to @xmath14 at a well - defined value of the applied stress which coincides with the yield stress @xmath17 , such approaches which directly account for the evolution of @xmath12 are able to predict a smooth ( gradual ) solid - fluid transition which",
    "is often observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "2 .   from the point of view of a rheologist , these models are quite versatile , as with a minimal readjustment of the parameters they can model various types of tests : flow ramps @xcite , small amplitude oscillations ( saos ) @xcite , large amplitude oscillatory flows ( laos ) @xcite and creep / relaxation flows .",
    "3 .    they can flexibly model the irreversibility of the deformation states when the applied stresses are increased / decreased around the solid - fluid transition .",
    "moreover , they can quantitatively describe the experimentally observed rheological hysteresis and the dependence of its magnitude on the degree of steadiness of the forcing @xcite as reflected by the area of the hysteresis of the dependence @xmath18 , on the degree of the steadiness of the external forcing ( i.e.  how fast is the external stress varied about the solid - fluid transition ) .",
    "4 .   from a practical standpoint",
    ", they are relatively easy to implement .",
    "though able to model sufficiently complex rheological data ( ranging from controlled stress / strain unsteady flow ramps , creep tests and oscillatory tests in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes ) , such phenomenological macroscopic models do have a number of limitations :    1 .   as the functional dependence @xmath19 in eq .",
    "[ eq : structuralmodels ] is generally chosen on an intuitive basis rather derived from first principles , these models can teach little about the microscopic scale physics of the yielding process .",
    "they typically involve a rather large number of parameters some of which are not directly and easily measurable and can be obtained only by fitting the experimental data .",
    "3 .    second , such models are not inherently validated from a thermodynamical standpoint .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics is not guaranteed to be held and such a validation is not always straightforward as it requires the derivation of a thermodynamic potential @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the yield stress behaviour originates from the presence of a _",
    "`` soft '' _ microstructure which can only sustain a finite local stress prior to its breakdown , an alternative way of assessing the dynamics of the yielding process is to focus on the evolution of the micro - structural soft material units as the external stress is gradually increased past the solid - fluid transition and next to assess the macroscopic scale behaviour from the perspective of statistical mechanics .",
    "a thermodynamic approach for the deformation of a physical gel has been recently proposed by an and coworkers @xcite . by using a mean field approach ,",
    "they construct a free energy functional and describe the microscopic scale dynamics of the gel network as a function of the applied stress in terms of the monomer volume fraction and an internal connectivity tensor characterising the gel network .",
    "peshkov and his coworkers have employed the irreversible mechanics and thermodynamics of two - phase continua to describe the yielding process but a comparison with the experimental data seems to require future developments @xcite . @xcite has modelled the restricted diffusion of small tracer particles in heterogeneous media by performing monte carlo simulations in a site - percolation model and his results partially agreed with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have proposed in @xcite a microscopic picture of yielding inspired from the ising model of magnetisation of a ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the model was built on an analogy between the local agglomerative interactions in terms of assembly / disassembly of neighbouring microscopic constituents in a yield stress material subjected to an external stress and the local ferromagnetic interactions in terms of spin up ( @xmath20 ) / spin down ( @xmath21 ) of neighbouring particles in a microscopic ferromagnetic system subjected to an external magnetic field .",
    "first , our approach is fundamentally probabilistic and formalises gibbs fields as time - homogeneous and time - inhomogeneous markov chains over the state space of all microscopic configurations and thus it is thermodynamically validated .",
    "second , the model has solely two parameters .",
    "though able to capture several key physical features of the solid - fluid transition , from a practical perspective the applicability of this model to describe rheological measurements and real flow problems is somewhat limited .",
    "first , the microscopic constituents are assumed fixed over a lattice while the external stress is varied and thus there exists no direct of equivalent of the rate of deformation @xmath22 .",
    "second , as it is a statistical model , its implementation is not trivial and its usage is time consuming .",
    "the aim of the current contribution is to derive an approximation of the model in the form of a classical structural approach similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : structuralmodels ] which , together with the appropriate constitutive equation could ultimately describe rheological measurements .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , this approach is inspired by the ising model of ferromagnetism and its advantage is that , once formulated , it can fully benefit from the already developed tools of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "we investigate the model when the network of particles is the regular graph given by the toroidal two - dimensional square lattice .",

    "gelled_. the phase at a site directly affects its _ connectability _ with its neighbuoring sites .",
    "we assume that only two gelled sites can be connected with one another .",
    "we consider the following gibbs potential over the two types of cliques :    @xmath25    and @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the singleton clique , @xmath28 is the doubleton clique with @xmath29 ( the set of four nearest neighbouring sites of a given site @xmath24 ) , @xmath30 is the external stress applied , @xmath31 is the _ site - specific threshold _ , and @xmath32 is the _ interaction constant _ between neighbouring sites .",
    "it is important to note that the `` stress '' @xmath2 has actually the dimensions of an energy transferred to the lattice which is an obvious consequence of the fact that the sites in the lattice are fixed and there is no equivalent of a deformation @xmath33 of the lattice .",

    ", we have been able to qualitatively describe several main features of the solid - fluid transition experimentally observed for yield stress materials subjected to an external stress using a gibbs field statistical approach with only two internal parameters .",
    "this motivates us to derive in the following an approximate continuous version of this model which is similar in form to the classical micro - structural approaches generally described by eq .",
