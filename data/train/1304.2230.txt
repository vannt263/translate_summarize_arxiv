    "active probe - based microrheology , which monitors the position of a tracer particle ( tp ) driven by an external force , has become a powerful experimental tool for the analysis of different systems in physics , chemistry and biology ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the constant - forcing microrheology setup , a microscopic particle embedded in a sample",
    "is actively manipulated by applying a known force .",
    "one measures then the response of the tp and potentially the microstructural deformations of the medium to learn about its microrheological properties . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "an unresolved issue , which is disregarded in the available continuous analytical approaches , is to take into account explicitly the discreteness or `` granularity '' of the medium @xcite .",
    "this aspect becomes crucial when the probe and the medium particles have comparable sizes , e.g. in colloidal suspensions . in this regime , both fluctuations of the probe that can not be described correctly if the medium is treated as a continuous bath and super - diffusion regimes have been reported @xcite    within a broader context , modeling the response of a medium to a perturbation created by a tracer particle , biased by an external force , is a ubiquitous problem in physics , which has been the subject of a large number of theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the resulting stochastic dynamics of the whole system is however a many - body problem which is difficult ( or even impossible ) to solve even in the simplest case when the particle - particle interactions are a mere hard - core .",
    "for that reason , in most approaches the microscopic structure of the bath is not taken into account explicitly , and the response functions are determined instead by using some effective bath dynamics , modelled via langevin or generalized langevin @xcite equations ( see also refs .",
    "while these approaches are rather efficient , they can not account for the detailed correlations between the tracer particle and the fluctuating density profiles of the bath particles . in this paper , we show that these cross correlations are of crucial importance and can lead to non trivial effects beyond the usual analysis of the force - velocity relation .",
    "we predict in particular a non monotonic behavior of the variance of the tracer position with the density of the bath , that in principle could be observed in active microrheology experiments .",
    "our analysis relies on a model of driven tracer diffusion in a hard - core lattice gas , which appears as a minimal model of active microrheology that explicitly takes into account the dynamics of a bath of discrete particles : a tp driven by an external force performs a biased lattice random walk in a bath of hard - core particles , which themselves perform symmetric random walks constrained by the condition of a single occupancy of each lattice site .    at the theoretical level , the one dimensional version of this model is related to several well known models of out of equilibrium statistical physics . for example , in the absence of external driving",
    ", it reduces to the single file diffusion problem @xcite . in the absence of external driving and when additional adsorption / desorption processes with a reservoir of particles are considered , it corresponds to the so - called dynamical percolation @xcite .",
    "last , in the case of a constant external forcing experienced by _ all _ the particles , it identifies with the asymmetric exclusion process , which has now become a paradigmatic model , both in the absence ( see @xcite for a recent review ) or in the presence @xcite of adsorption / desorption processes .",
    "this model of driven tracer diffusion has been investigated both in the physical @xcite and in the mathematical @xcite literatures .",
    "most of the obtained results , including proofs of the einstein relation , are limited to the large time behavior of the mean position @xmath0 of the tracer particle and the stationary density profiles of the bath @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for the occupation number of the site @xmath3 of the lattice , equal to 1 if occupied by a bath particle and 0 otherwise . a general method to analyze the fluctuations of the tracer position",
    "@xmath4 and the cross - correlation functions of the form @xmath5 is still lacking . has been considered in @xcite , and the analysis was limited to the specific regime of high density of bath particles ]    here , for this minimal model of active microrheology we develop a theoretical framework allowing to analytically determine these fluctuations in all regimes of bath particles density , and in principle for arbitrary dimension .",
    "more precisely , our main results obtained within this formalism are ( i ) an exact einstein - type relation satisfied by the cross - correlations in the absence of a driving force and the density profiles of the bath particles in the linear - response regime .",
    "( ii ) an explicit approximate but accurate expression for the variance of the tracer position in a one - dimensional case valid for any density . (",
    "iii ) a finding that the variance of the position of the tracer can be a non - monotonic function of the density of bath particles , meaning that , counter - intuitively , an increase of the density of hard - core particles can increase the dispersion of the tracer position .",
    "we show that , in fact , subtle correlations between the tracer and the bath particles are responsible for this intriguing behavior .",
    "we anticipate that this striking effect could in principle be observed experimentally in the context of active microrheology .",
    "consider a @xmath6-dimensional hypercubic lattice of spacing @xmath7 in contact with a reservoir of particles kept at a constant chemical potential ( see figure [ modele ] ) .",
    "suppose next that the particles in the reservoir may adsorb onto vacant lattice sites at a fixed rate @xmath8 .",
    "the adsorbed particles may move randomly along the lattice by hopping at a rate @xmath9 to any of @xmath10 neighboring lattice sites , which process is constrained by a hard - core exclusion preventing multiple occupancy of any of the sites .",
    "the adsorbed particles may desorb from the lattice back to the reservoir at rate @xmath11 .",
    "the occupancy of lattice sites is described by the time - dependent boolean variable @xmath12 , which assumes two values , @xmath13 , if the site @xmath3 is occupied by an adsorbed particle , and @xmath14 , otherwise .",
    "note that the mean density of the bath particles , @xmath15 , approaches as @xmath16 a constant value @xmath17 but the number of particles on the lattice is not explicitly conserved in such a dynamics .    at @xmath18",
    "we introduce a tp , whose position at time @xmath19 is denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "the tp dynamics is different from that of the adsorbed particles in two aspects : first , it can not desorb from the lattice and second , it is subject to an external driving force * e * , which favors its jumps along the direction corresponding to the unit vector @xmath21 of the lattice .",
    "physically , such a situation is realized in the context of active microrheology where the force on the tp is classically exerted by magnetic tweezers @xcite .",
    "the tp dynamics is defined in the usual fashion : we suppose that the tracer , which occupies the site @xmath22 at time @xmath19 , waits an exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath23 , and then attempts to hop onto one of @xmath10 neighboring sites , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are @xmath10 unit vectors of the hypercubic lattice . the jump direction is chosen according to the probability @xmath26 , which obeys : @xmath27\\left/\\sum_{\\mu}\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\beta}{2}({\\bf e \\cdot e } _ { \\mu})\\right]\\right .",
    ", \\label{defp}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the inverse temperature and @xmath29 denotes summation over all possible orientations of the vector @xmath30 .",
    "the hop is instantaneously fulfilled if the target site is vacant at this moment of time ; otherwise , i.e. , if the target site is occupied by any adsorbed particle , the jump is rejected and the tracer remains at its position .",
    "we focus on the projection of the tp position @xmath31 , which evolves in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath32 according to @xmath33 where w.p .",
    "stands for with probability . averaging this equation , it is easy to find that the mean @xmath0 and the variance @xmath34 of the tp position verify : @xmath35 and    @xmath36    [ dispersion ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 note that the right - hand side of ( [ 1 ] ) is a trivial mean - field term in which the effective jump frequency is given by @xmath39 . in turn , the two other contributions are nontrivial : the first one ( [ 2 ] ) originates from the difference between the actual density of bath particles in the tp neighborhood and their unperturbed value @xmath40 .",
    "the second one ( [ 3 ] ) involves the correlations between the tp position and the occupation numbers in front and behind the tracer .",
    "as we proceed to show , these two non trivial contributions , referred to in the following as the density and the cross - correlation contributions , are responsible for a non trivial behavior of the variance @xmath34 .",
    "now , in order to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath34 , we have to determine the density profiles @xmath41 and the cross - correlation functions @xmath42 at the sites adjacent to the tp , which requires , in turn , the evaluation of the density profiles @xmath43 and the cross - correlation functions @xmath44 for arbitrary @xmath45 .",
    "the evolution equations of these latter quantities can be deduced from the master equation ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) but these equations are not closed . actually , they are coupled to the higher order correlations functions , so that one faces the problem of solving an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations . here",
    "we resort to the simplest non - trivial closure of the hierarchy , by using the following decoupling approximation : @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ prof ] ) has already been used in refs . @xcite and was shown to result in very good quantitative estimates of the tp mean position , while the one in ( [ corr ] ) is new and , as we proceed to show , gives approximate expressions for the variance of the tp position which are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "note that these relations are natural mean - field type approximations , since they can be regarded as expansions at the leading order in the fluctuation parameter @xmath48 .    relying on these approximations ,",
    "we finally obtain closed equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 which hold for all @xmath49 , except for @xmath50 : @xmath51and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the operator @xmath54 @xmath55 is the discrete gradient defined by @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 with @xmath59 , i.e. , the sites adjacent to the tp , we find @xmath60 and @xmath61 note that eqs.([systemek2 ] ) and ( [ systemeg2 ] ) represent the boundary conditions for the general evolution equations ( [ systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemeg1 ] ) , imposed on the sites in the immediate vicinity of the tp . equations ( [ systemek1])-([systemeg2 ] ) together with eqs.([xmean ] ) and ( [ dispersion ] ) constitute a closed system of equations which suffices for computation of the variance @xmath62 for any density and in arbitrary dimension .",
    "these equations also give access to the cross - correlation functions @xmath63 .",
    "our starting point here is the usual einstein relation @xmath64 between the mobility @xmath65 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath66 , which has been shown to hold exactly for the system we study @xcite .",
    "we now use the relations ( [ xmean ] ) and ( [ dispersion ] ) in the long time limit to obtain the mobility and the diffusion coefficient in terms of the density profiles and the correlation functions : @xmath67 and @xmath68\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq([defp ] ) , as well as the trivial symmetry relations @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a non vanishing constant , we finally get the exact einstein - type relation of the form @xmath72 this equation relates a cross correlation function ( between the tracer and the bath ) in the absence of field , to the linear response of the bath itself , and is compatible with the fluctuation dissipation relation described in @xcite .",
    "lengthy but straightforward calculations lead to analytical expressions of the density profiles @xmath73 and cross - correlation functions @xmath74 , allowing in particular to determine the dispersion coefficient @xmath75 ( expressions given in appendix [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that this expression of @xmath76 is in excellent agreement with results of numerical simulations for any density , which validates the decoupling approximation in eqs .",
    "( [ prof ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "we here discuss three important consequences stemming from this expression .    .",
    "analytical expression ( solid lines ) vs numerical simulations ( symbols ) for different biases ( filled symbols : @xmath77 ; empty symbols : @xmath78 ) and desorption rates @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 : 0.15 ; @xmath82 : 0.2 ; @xmath83 : 0.3 ; @xmath84 : 0.8 ) .",
    "inset : the different contributions to the dispersion coefficient , as defined in the main text , as a function of the density @xmath40 for @xmath85 : trivial mean - field ( dashed ) , density ( dotted ) , and cross - correlation ( dashdotted ) contributions .",
    "the sum of these contributions is the dispersion coefficient ( analytical expression represented by a solid line vs numerical simulations denoted by symbols).,width=302 ]    first , in the important limiting situation where no external driving is applied to the system , we find that @xmath86 beyond its own interest , this expression together with the approximate expression for the velocity obtained in @xcite in the linear driving regime using the decoupling approximation ( [ prof ] ) shows that the einstein relation ( exact for the system under study @xcite ) is satisfied under the decoupling approximations , eqs .",
    "( [ prof ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the approximations ( [ prof ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) are compatible with each other , which is a further validation of their applicability .",
    "second , in the high density limit , @xmath87 , the dispersion coefficient obeys @xmath88 at leading order in @xmath89 , @xmath76 is thus _ independent _ of the amplitude of the driving force .",
    "quite unexpectedly , it turns out that the dependence on the driving force of the density and of the correlation contributions to the dispersion coefficient exactly compensate each other in this limit .",
    "last , our analytical expression shows that , strikingly , @xmath76 is a non - monotonic function of the density @xmath40 , for values of @xmath79 smaller than some critical value @xmath90 , and has a marked maximum at a certain value of @xmath40 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this result is a bit counter - intuitive , since one naturally expects that the dispersion will be maximal when there are no hard - core bath particles ( i.e. , when @xmath91 ) .     as a function of the distance to the tracer @xmath92 for different values of the density @xmath40 and of the bias @xmath93 .",
    "analytical expressions ( empty symbols ) vs numerical simulations ( filled symbols ) .",
    "( a ) @xmath94 , @xmath95 ; ( b ) and ( c ) @xmath96 , @xmath95.,width=340 ]    to gain some insight into this non trivial behavior , we represent ( see inset of fig [ fig1 ] ) three different contributions to the dispersion coefficient defined above ( trivial mean - field , density , and cross - correlation contributions ) .",
    "as can be immediately seen , the non monotonic behavior of the variance originates from the non - monotonic behavior with @xmath40 of the cross - correlation function @xmath97 in front of the tracer .",
    "these cross - correlations functions @xmath74 , which provide a quantitative measure of the correlations between the fluctuations of the tracer position and the occupation numbers of the bath particles , are thus crucial in the problem . actually , they display other non trivial and important behaviours ( see fig .",
    "[ ggprofile ] ) revealed by our analytical expressions .",
    "we first stress that the sign itself of these quantities is not trivial .",
    "while the analytical expressions allow us to show that , past the tracer , @xmath74 is always negative and corresponds to an anti - correlation of the fluctuations , it is found that @xmath98 is positive in the high density limit @xmath99\\tau/\\tau^*}>0\\ ] ] or in the absence of a driving force @xmath100 where @xmath101 is given by eq.([ke0 ] ) , but can change sign otherwise . in other words , depending on the amplitude of the driving force and the density of the bath particles , positive or negative correlations between the fluctuations of the tracer position and the occupation numbers of the bath particles can take place .",
    "in addition , the monotonicity with the distance of these cross - correlation functions is also non - trivial ",
    "past ( see fig . [",
    "ggprofile](a ) ) and in front of ( see fig .",
    "[ ggprofile](b ) ) the tracer  which further mirrors the complexity of these correlations .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of a driven tracer in a bath of hard - core particles in the presence of adsorption / desorption processes . for this minimal model of active microrheology",
    ", we have developed an analytical framework to go beyond the standard force - velocity relation and quantitatively analyzed the fluctuations of the position of the tracer and their correlations with the occupation number of the bath particles at any position , for _ any _ density of the bath particles .",
    "this approach allowed us to obtain an exact einstein - type relation between these correlations in the absence of a driving force and the density profiles of the bath particles in the linear driving regime . in the one - dimensional case we also provided an approximate but accurate explicit expression of the variance of the position of the tracer and shown in particular that it can behave non - monotically with the density of bath particles : counter - intuitively , increasing the density of hard - core particles can significantly increase the dispersion of the tracer position .",
    "we have shown that subtle correlations between the tracer position and the occupation of the bath particles past and in front of the tracer are responsible for this non trivial behavior .",
    "altogether , our results put forward cross correlations as observables to analyze active microrheology data and predict a striking non monotonic behavior of the variance of the position of the tracer with respect to the density of the bath , that could in principle be observed experimentally . in a broader context , equations ( [ systemek1 ] ) to ( [ systemeg2 ] ) together with eqs.([xmean ] ) and ( [ dispersion ] )",
