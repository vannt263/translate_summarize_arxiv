    "in many wireless settings there is a need to broadcast a block of data packets from one sender to multiple receivers over independent erasure channels @xcite .",
    "a key problem in this context is to find an efficient broadcast scheme that allows all receivers to obtain all the data packets in the presence of erasures .",
    "it has been shown that the _ random linear network coding ( rlnc ) _",
    "@xcite technique can almost surely minimize the number of transmissions , and , in turn , maximize throughput by transmitting coded packets , which are random linear combinations of all the data packets using a sufficiently large finite field .",
    "rlnc relies on _ block - decoding _",
    ", i.e. , all data packets can only be decoded when a sufficient number of coded packets have been received .",
    "however , this approach results in large packet decoding delays @xcite and high computational load @xcite .",
    "one possible way to reduce computational load is to use the sparse rlnc technique @xcite , in which the linear coefficients are more likely to be zeros .",
    "however , its packet decodings are still based on the whole block , hence the packet decoding delay is still large .    in this letter , we focus on rlnc - based broadcast schemes that partition the block of data packets into _ generations _ and construct the coded combinations from data packets that belong to the same generation .",
    "this technique results in a substantial reduction of the computational load .",
    "it also allows decoding of data packets that belong to the current generation before the next generation is transmitted , resulting in a significant decrease in the packet decoding delay",
    ".    while generation - based rlnc techniques are efficient in reducing the packet decoding delay and minimizing the computational load , they result in a larger number of transmissions , and , as a result , lower throughput .",
    "the main problem in this context is to design throughput - efficient generation - based rlnc schemes .",
    "this issue has been the subject of many studies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies , however , focused on settings with no receiver feedback . in such settings ,",
    "the sender is unaware of what packets are missing at each receiver , hence it can not utilize this information to optimize the transmission scheme .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", only few studies have focused on the transmission schemes with feedback .",
    "@xcite considered the partitioning problem based on solutions borrowed from instantly decodable network coding ( idnc ) . however , since idnc requires instant decodability of the coded combinations , it does not provide insight into the partitioning problem when more general coding techniques are used .",
    "reference @xcite proposes a limited feedback scheme that utilizes rlnc with block decoding .",
    "this scheme , however , still suffers from heavy computational load and large packet decoding delays .    in this letter",
    ", we study the general partitioning problem by considering a two - phase broadcast scheme with limited receiver feedback . in the first phase",
    ", each data packet in the block is transmitted once in an uncoded form .",
    "then , the receivers feed back their packet reception state to the sender . based on this information , the sender partitions the packet block into generations and broadcasts a set of coded packets , where each coded packet is a combination of packet that belong to the same generation .",
    "the receivers use coded packets to recover missing data packets .",
    "our contributions can be summarized as follows : ( i ) we formulate an optimal partitioning problem and establish its np - hardness ; ( ii ) we propose a heuristic partitioning algorithm that strikes a balance between decoding delay and block completion time and provides a local pareto - optimal solution .",
    "( iii ) we perform an extensive simulation study that shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform the previously proposed methods in the literature .",
    "we consider a scenario in which a sender wants to broadcast a block of @xmath0 data packets @xmath1 to a set of @xmath2 receivers @xmath3 through wireless channels which are subject to independent random packet erasures . in the first phase , referred to as the _ systematic transmission phase _ , the sender broadcasts each packet in @xmath4 without coding .",
    "then , the sender collects one round of feedback from each receiver about its packet reception state .",
    "this information is represented by a binary @xmath5 state feedback matrix ( sfm ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 means that @xmath8 has missed @xmath9 and thus still wants it , and @xmath10 means @xmath8 has received @xmath9 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the number of receivers that want @xmath9 .",
    "an example of sfm with @xmath12 is given in fig.[fig : sfm_graph](a ) .",
    "based on the sfm , the sender then partitions @xmath4 into a set of @xmath13 disjoint _ generations _ , denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "we define the _ rank _ @xmath15 of a generation @xmath16 as the maximum number of packets in @xmath16 wanted by one receiver , i.e. ,    @xmath17 for example , for the sfm in fig.[fig : sfm_graph](a ) , generation @xmath18 has a rank of 2 .",
    "the sender then starts a _ coded transmission phase_. in each transmission , it broadcasts a coded packet of a generation , which is a linear combination of data packets from this generation .",
    "we consider random linear network coding ( rlnc ) @xcite , which chooses the linear coefficients uniformly at random from a finite field @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath19 is sufficiently large , rlnc asymptotically guarantees linear independency between coded packets , so that any receiver who wants @xmath20 packets from @xmath21 can decode these packets after receiving @xmath20 coded packets of @xmath21 with high probability .",
    "note that this decoding condition can also be achieved by deterministic codes such as maximum - distance - separation ( mds ) codes and fountain codes @xcite .",
    "we focus on rlnc for clarity , but our techniques can be extended to other codes .    in our context , the original rlnc technique uses only one generation , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "when it is applied , a receiver who is missing @xmath23 packets from @xmath4 needs to receive @xmath23 linearly independent coded packets of @xmath4 before being able to decode them , which incurs a computational complexity of @xmath24 @xcite . to minimize the computational load and reduce the packet decoding delay ,",
    "while also maintaining a good throughput performance , we propose the following _ minimum partitioning _ ( mp ) problem :    given an sfm @xmath6 and a constant @xmath25 , find the minimum value of @xmath13 , for which there exists a partition of the packet block @xmath4 into @xmath13 disjoint generations @xmath14 such that the rank of each generation @xmath16 does not exceed @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 for @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "minimizing the total number of generations @xmath13 is an important goal due to the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the lower values of @xmath13 would result in smaller number of transmissions and , as a result , higher throughput .",
    "in particular , we need at least @xmath28 transmissions in the coded transmission phase to satisfy all receivers . due to erasures ,",
    "more transmissions may be needed , but its number will depend on @xmath13 , and lower values of @xmath13 typically require a smaller number of transmissions .",
    "2 .   the lower values of @xmath13 reduce the overall computational load of decoding algorithm .",
    "indeed , every receiver can decode the data packets it wants from any generation by solving a set of at most @xmath25 linear equations .",
    "this bounds the total computational load of decoding to @xmath29 operations .",
    "3 .   the lower values of @xmath13 reduce the average packet decoding delay ( apdd ) @xmath30 , i.e. , the average time it takes for a receiver to decode a data packet .",
    "it is calculated as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the time index in the coded transmission phase when @xmath8 decodes @xmath9 . +",
    "also note that the apdd of a partition is upper bounded as @xcite : @xmath33 so that the lower values of @xmath13 typically result in lower values of @xmath30 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the hardness of problem mp by constructing a reduction from a hypergraph coloring problem .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath34 is defined by a pair @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the set of vertices , and @xmath37 is the set of hyperedges .",
    "every hyperedge @xmath38 is a subset of @xmath36 with size @xmath39 .",
    "a hypergraph is @xmath40uniform if for every hyperedge @xmath38 it holds that @xmath41 .",
    "a @xmath25-regular coloring of @xmath34 with @xmath13 colors is a partition @xmath42 of @xmath36 that satisfies @xmath43 for each @xmath44 .",
    "the minimum number @xmath13 of colors required for a @xmath25-regular coloring of @xmath34 is called the @xmath25-chromatic number of @xmath34 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the problem of finding the @xmath25-chromatic number for a given hypergraph is np - complete .",
    "our reduction includes the following steps .",
    "given @xmath34 , for every vertex @xmath45 we generate a data packet @xmath9 , and for every hyperedge @xmath46 we generate a receiver @xmath8 who wants the data packets that correspond to the vertices that are incident to @xmath46 .",
    "for example , the sfm in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfm_graph](a ) can be generated from the hypergraph depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfm_graph](b ) , with 6 data packets / vertices and 4 receivers / hyperedges .",
    "let @xmath42 be a @xmath25-regular coloring solution of the instance @xmath34 of the @xmath25-regular coloring problem . then , let @xmath14 be a partition of @xmath4 such that for @xmath47 , a generation @xmath16 includes packets that correspond to vertices in @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath49 is a valid solution to problem mp with @xmath13 generations such that the rank of each generation is bounded by @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , for any solution @xmath14 of problem mp , we can construct a @xmath25-regular coloring solution @xmath42 with @xmath13 colors , in which each set @xmath48 includes vertices that correspond to packets in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , an optimal algorithm for problem mp can be used to find the @xmath50chromatic number of a hypergraph , which is an np - complete problem .",
    "we summarize our results in the following theorem :    problem mp is np - complete .",
    "we note that our reduction can also be used to establish the hardness of several special cases of our problem based on other results in graph theory .",
    "for example , it is an np - complete problem to find 2-regular coloring with two colors for a @xmath51-uniform hypergraph @xcite .",
    "this implies that , in the special case in which every receiver wants @xmath52 data packets , it is np - complete to find a partition of size @xmath53 with the rank of each generation being bounded by @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , it is np - complete to find the chromatic number of hypergraphs in the special case of 1-regular coloring @xcite .",
    "this implies that our problem is intractable even for the special case of @xmath55 , in which every generation can include at most one missing packet for any receiver @xcite .",
    "thus , by using our technique we can recover the hardness result of instantly decodable network coding established in @xcite using a different approach .",
    "in this section , we propose a heuristic algorithm for problem  mp .",
    "in addition to aiming to minimizing the number of partitions , our algorithm also orders the partitions in such a way that popular packets ( i.e. , packets with large values of @xmath11 ) are assigned to early generations .",
    "the partition ordering satisfies the _ irreducibility _ property , i.e. , no data packet from a generation @xmath16 can be moved to an earlier generation @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) without increasing its rank @xcite .",
    "the irreducibility property , in turn , implies that the proposed algorithm achieves local _ pareto - optimal _ trade - off between throughput and packet decoding delay delay .",
    "note that another approach for problem mp is to find the corresponding instance of the hypergraph coloring problem and then use existing hypergraph coloring algorithms .",
    "however , existing approximation algorithms for the hypergraph coloring problem mainly focus on the special case of uniform hypergraphs ( e.g. , @xcite ) and do not consider other aspects of the solution mentioned above .",
    "the detailed description of the algorithm is provided in algorithm  1 .",
    "the algorithm receives as inputs a state feedback matrix @xmath6 and the upper bound @xmath25 of the rank of each generation .",
    "the algorithm iteratively creates generations and fills them with packets . at each step",
    ", the algorithm searches for a packet that can be added to the current generation without increasing its rank .",
    "if such a packet exits , it is added to the generation .",
    "if such a packet does not exits and the rank of the current generation is less than @xmath25 , then the most popular packet in @xmath4 is added to the current generation . a packet that is added to the current generation",
    "is removed from @xmath4 .",
    "if the the size of the current generation is @xmath25 and no packet can be added to it without increasing its rank , than a new generation is formed .",
    "the algorithm starts with empty generation @xmath58 and terminates when set @xmath4 becomes empty .",
    "initialize : sfm @xmath6 , generation rank @xmath25 , a counter @xmath59 @xmath60 , create an empty generation @xmath16 ; add the most popular packet that satisfies this condition to @xmath16 , and then remove it from @xmath4 ; add the most popular packet in @xmath4 to @xmath16 , and then remove it from @xmath4 .",
    "increase @xmath15 by one ;",
    "]    in this section , we compare the performance of our algorithm with alternative solutions . note that once the packet block is partitioned into generations , there are several different ways to schedule transmissions in the coded transmission phase to satisfy all the receivers . in our experiments , we used the following strategy .",
    "the sender broadcasts the generations in a round - robin manner until all receivers are satisfied and feedback acks . in every transmission",
    "round @xmath15 coded packets of each generation @xmath16 are broadcast .",
    "we note that several more advanced strategies may also be used .",
    "for example , the sender can send more than @xmath15 coded packets of each @xmath16 in the first round to increase the probability of block completion after this round , or it can merge generations together with the help of extra feedback to reduce redundant packets @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : tradeoff_g ] compares the performance of the partition solutions produced by our algorithm with the idnc - based algorithm presented in @xcite in terms of throughput - delay performance , measured by the block completion time @xmath61 and average packet decoding delay @xmath30 , respectively . in our experiments ,",
    "the packet block size is @xmath62 and the packet erasures in the systematic transmission phase are random i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a probability of @xmath63 . in this figure",
    "only , we assume that the coded transmissions are erasure - free .",
    "our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm always outperforms the idnc - based one in terms of @xmath61 .",
    "the improvement becomes more significant with increasing number of receivers .",
    "the @xmath30 of the two algorithms is similar when @xmath25 is large , but our algorithm outperforms the idnc - based one with increasing number of receivers when @xmath25 is small .",
    "we also evaluate the gain achieved by our algorithm , enabled by the feedback collected after the systematic transmission phase . to this end",
    ", we compare the throughput and decoding delay of the coded transmission phase when our algorithm and the _ blind _",
    "partition approach are applied , respectively . with the blind partition approach , we sequentially segment the packet block into @xmath13 generations , each carrying @xmath64 data packets , where @xmath13 is set to be the number of generation produced by our algorithm .",
    "if the blind partition is applied , only one coded packet of every generation is broadcast in each round , as the sender is unaware of the generation ranks .    in our experiments ,",
    "the packet block size is @xmath62 , and the packet erasures are random i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a probability of @xmath63 in both the systematic and coded transmission phases .",
    "the simulation results are shown in fig.[fig : performance_gain ] .",
    "we observe that by collecting only one round of feedback , our algorithm can reduce the block completion time by 30% and the average packet decoding delay by 40% , compared to the blind partition",
    ". the improvement decreases with increasing @xmath25 , because both techniques will converge to the original rlnc .",
    "in this letter , we showed that feedback - assisted partitioning can bring a better tradeoff in terms of throughput , computational load , and packet decoding delay in rlnc - based wireless broadcast .",
    "we established the np - completeness of optimal partition problem and presented a heuristic partition algorithm that achieves local pareto - optimality .",
    "our extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previously proposed solutions . as a future work ,",
    "we are interested in developing generation - based approaches that use deterministic coding techniques , such as mds codes and fountain codes .",
