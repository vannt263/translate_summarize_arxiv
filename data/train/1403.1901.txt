    "the uncertainties are estimated by phase - connecting pulse - profiles from the beginning and end of each observation .",
    "we do not allow for a change in the pulse period during one observation , but the error introduced is below the precision needed for the analysis presented here .",
    "the measured periods show a continuous spin - up over the duration of the outburst ( see table  [ tab : obslog ] ) , in agreement with the _ swift_/xrt snap - shots and the _ fermi_/gbm pulsar monitoring @xcite . to describe the phase - resolved spectra we use the same model as for the phase - averaged spectrum , but fix the line energies and widths of the crsf and the @xmath7line as well as the temperature of the black - body due to the reduced statistical quality of the spectra .",

    "the strength of the crsf shows a very interesting behavior with pulse phase , as shown for all observations in figure  [ fig : phaseres ] , right panel .",
    "as expected from the phase - averaged spectra , the line is clearly strongest in observation 2 , being detectable over a wide phase - range between phases 0.61.3 . during the main peak of the pulse - profile the line strength drops to 0 . in observation 1",
    "the line is also significantly detected in absorption between phases 0.91.1 . around phase 0.3",
    "there are low significance indications that the line is instead visible in emission . in observation 3",
    "the line strength is scattering around 0 , only one phase bin around phase 1.0 shows an absorption line clearly above the 95% limit . in the phase - resolved spectra",
    "we allow the iron line normalization and the black - body normalization to vary to obtain a statistically acceptable fit ( not shown in figure  [ fig : phaseres ] ) .",
    "we carefully checked that any variation in these parameters does not influence the strength of the crsf .",
    "while the iron line shows the largest equivalent width during the minimum of the pulse profile , i.e. , at the same phases where the crsf is most prominent , it does not influence the spectral shape at the crsf energy .",
    "the black - body did not vary significantly over the pulse phase .    to investigate the energy dependence of the crsf with pulse - phase , we extracted spectra from observation 2 using seven , wider phase bins to increase the s / n . for these spectra",
    "we also allow the iron line energy and width , as well as the blackbody temperature to vary .",
    "we keep the width of the crsf fixed to the best phase - averaged value , as it otherwise became unconstrained during the fits .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : phaseres ] , _ right ( a ) _ we do not detect a significant variation of the line energy with pulse phase . between phases 0.40.6 we again detected no significant line , resulting in an unconstrained energy .",
    "besides changes with pulse - phase , changes of the line energy with luminosity are quite common ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) . to search for such a luminosity dependence between observations , we extract spectra for each observation of those phases ,",
    "in which the line was significantly detected in observation 2 .",
    "this approach allows to obtain the most significant line and therefore most precise energy measurement , as indicated by the blue data points in figure  [ fig : phaseres ] .",
    "we describe the spectra with the same model as for the seven wide phase bins described above .",
    "we do not detect a significant change of the line energy , with the measured values being @xmath105kev , @xmath106kev , and @xmath107kev for observation 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "we have presented a spectral analysis of three _ nustar_observations of the be - x - ray binary ks  1947 + 300with simultaneous _ swift_/xrt data , taken during its large 2013/2014 outburst .",
    "the broad spectral coverage provided by the combination of these two instruments allowed us to discover a crsf absorption feature around 12.5kev .",
    "the feature was significantly detected in the phase - averaged spectrum of the brightest observation , and during the broad pulse minimum in phase - resolved spectroscopy in all observations . during the pulse maximum",
    "the feature is not seen significantly , either in absorption or emission .",
    "the line energy and width is similar to the lines detected in 4u0115 + 63 and swift  j1626.6@xmath135156 @xcite .",
    "we deduce a surface magnetic field of @xmath108 g , assuming that the line is the fundamental line . here",
    "@xmath12 is the gravitational redshift , defined by @xmath109 for typical neutron star parameters , @xmath110 if the line - forming region is close to the surface .",
    "this magnetic field strength puts ks  1947 + 300at the lower end of known cyclotron lines sources ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    during the broad minimum phase of the pulse profile",
    ", we detect the crsf in all three observations .",
    "the luminosity near @xmath111ergs@xmath97 puts ks  1947 + 300clearly in the super - critical accretion regime , where the radiation pressure is strong enough to decelerate the in - falling matter before the neutron star surface via a radiation - dominated shock @xcite . in this regime , a negative correlation between the crsf energy and luminosity is expected @xcite , as observed , for example , in v0332 + 53 @xcite . if the correlation were of a similar strength as observed in v0332 + 53 we would not have detected it due to the very small range of luminosities sampled .",
    "the time - resolved _",
    "swift_/xrt spectra show a strongly variable photon - index @xmath17 over the outburst , with changes of 10% or more within 3days and softening with increasing x - ray flux .",
    "this softening agrees with the expected behavior in the supercritical accretion regime , as shown by @xcite for various other sources .",
    "however , because we restricted the model to describe basically all changes in spectral hardness in the photon - index , it is probable that the true physical changes are more complex than a variable photon - index , e.g. , the black - body temperature might vary independently of the x - ray flux .",
    "nonetheless , intrinsic source variability must be present .",
    "we clearly detect a @xmath7line in all data sets , with an energy significantly above the line energy for neutral iron ( see table  [ tab : bestfit_all ] ) and broadened in excess of the energy resolution of _ nustar_.",
    "while doppler - broadening could be responsible for part of the observed width , the increased energy indicates that the fluorescence region is slightly ionized and the observed broadening originates from a blend of @xmath7at different low ionization states .",
    "the data do not allow us to disentangle different lines from one single broad line .",
