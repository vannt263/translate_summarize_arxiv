    "<S> the case of the sudoku graph receives particular attention , because critical sets correspond to minimal fair puzzles . </S>",
    "<S> we define four parameters associated with the sizes of extremal critical sets and ( a ) prove several general results about these parameters properties , including their computational intractability , ( b ) compute their values exactly for some classes of graphs , ( c ) obtain bounds for generalized sudoku graphs , and ( d ) offer a number of open questions regarding critical sets and the aforementioned parameters .    </S>",

    "<S> 05c15 , 05b15 , 68r10 , 05c35    a recent announcement due to mcguire , et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xcite ) , surprised many in the community of sudoku researchers , amateur and professional alike , with its complete resolution of the `` minimum number of clues '' ( mnc ) problem . </S>",
    "<S> _ sudoku _ is a single - player game in which one completes a partial @xmath0 matrix @xmath1 all of whose entries are drawn from @xmath2 by appealing to the _ rules _ : no number may appear twice in any row , any column , or any of the nine `` blocks '' , each a @xmath3 submatrix with indices @xmath4 for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a `` board '' is a matrix adhering to these rules ; a `` puzzle '' is a partially filled - in board ; the nonempty entries of a puzzle are called `` clues '' or `` givens '' . </S>",
    "<S> a puzzle is said to be `` fair '' if it can be completed to a valid board in precisely one way . </S>",
    "<S> the mnc problem asks : what is the fewest number of clues in a fair sudoku puzzle ? while it was long suspected that the answer is @xmath6 , a proof seemed out of reach until @xcite .    however , the sense in which the authors of @xcite `` proved '' that the solution is indeed @xmath6 arguably does not meet modern standards of mathematical rigor . </S>",
    "<S> ( the paper briefly acknowledges this deficiency , although popular press wide reporting of the result typically did not address this important , if subtle , issue . ) </S>",
    "<S> there are several interesting ideas presented in the aforementioned manuscript  mostly careful case reductions and very clever search strategies  but , in the end , the result relied on a _ year - long _ computation , amounting to @xmath7 million core hours on an sgi altic ice 8200ex cluster with 320 nodes , each of which consisted of two intel xeon e5650 hex - core processors with 24 gb of ram . </S>",
    "<S> even if one sets aside well - worn ( and important ) philosophical critiques of computer - assisted proofs that appeal to uncheckability by humans and the social nature of proof , it is almost inconceivable that this enormous computation on an extremely complicated configuration of networked and nested devices did not experience hardware errors ( due to manufacturing defects , cosmic rays , background radiation , the inherent stochasticity of quantum mechanics , etc . ) _ and _ software errors ( bugs in the various operating systems , firmware , algorithmic code , guis , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> while such errors may not have produced an incorrect answer , they certainly undermine the definitiveness of the result . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we wish to draw attention to the subject matter of `` critical sets '' for graph colorings , a concept that neatly generalizes the mnc problem as well as several other questions scattered throughout the discrete mathematics literature , in the hopes that greater visibility might eventually lead to human - readable solutions to questions like the mnc .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining `` determining sets '' for graph colorings : a set @xmath8 of vertices with the property that the coloring , restricted to @xmath8 , can be completed in precisely one way ( i.e. , back to the original coloring ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a `` determining set '' of vertices in a graph @xmath9 with respect to a proper vertex coloring @xmath10 $ ] is a set @xmath11 with the property that , for any proper vertex coloring @xmath12 of @xmath13 , if @xmath14 , then @xmath15 on all of @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> if a determining set is minimal with respect to this property , we call it `` critical '' .    a `` critical set '' of vertices in a graph @xmath9 with respect to a proper vertex coloring @xmath10 $ ] is a minimal determining set for the pair @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cardinality of the largest and smallest critical sets in various graphs have appeared in a number of guises . </S>",
    "<S> latin squares ( and , of course , the special subclass of them that comprise sudoku boards ) , matching theory , design theory , and the study of dominating vertex sets all feature variants of this idea . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for a more comprehensive list of related topics and references . ) </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we define the following parameters .    for a graph @xmath9 and a vertex coloring </S>",

    "<S> unless stated explicitly , we generally rely on the conventions of @xcite ; in particular , we sometimes write the edge @xmath24 simply as @xmath25 . for a vertex @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we define the `` neighborhood '' of @xmath27 to be @xmath28 , where the subscript may be omitted if it is obvious . </S>",
