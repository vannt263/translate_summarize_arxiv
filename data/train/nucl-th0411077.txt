    "up to 1991 it was generally accepted that antiprotons after entering a matter would very quickly annihilate via strong interaction with nuclei of matter . however in 1991 at kek it was discovered @xcite that antiprotons could really survive in the midst of the ordinary helium atoms for the time intervals at least of the same order of value as the lifetime of the muon .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the formation of the specific metastable states , for which radiative and auger transitions are strongly suppressed .",
    "similar states for hadronic helium atoms were predicted a long time ago @xcite .",
    "internal structure of the @xmath21 metastable states can be considered , roughly , as electron in the ground state and antiproton in the @xmath4 -state with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a reduced mass of @xmath24 system .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath25 should be sufficiently large to form a circular or nearly - circular state , i.e. @xmath26 .    if antiproton has `` sat down '' on a such orbit , it will experience only a delayed annihilation .",
    "therefore the sequence of the phenomena after entering of the antiprotons in matter seems to be as follows .",
    "when the antiproton will be proved to be in the helium target it quickly loses its energy through the ionization .",
    "when the kinetic energy falls below the ionization energy of helium atom ( @xmath27 ev ) , the antiproton knocks out one of the electrons in a he atom by the coulomb interaction and occupies the orbit that is close to the orbit of the knocked electron .",
    "the formed @xmath21 atom should have an initial kinetic energy about @xmath28 ev as a recoil energy and after a time shorter than a nanosecond it reaches the thermal equilibrium with the medium .",
    "after thermalization the antiprotonic atom will be in one of the states accessible for it and will proceed to collide with the neutral atoms of helium .",
    "these collisions will change the initial populations of the states of the antiproton atoms and also other their properties , such as rates of transitions , shifts and broadenings of spectral lines .",
    "these changes were identified by the method of laser resonance spectroscopy so it is opened a new layer of interesting physics ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in particular ,",
    "the density shifts and broadenings of e1 spectral lines @xmath29 were observed for laser - induced transitions .",
    "the model theoretical analysis @xcite shows that qualitative peculiarities of the data are related to quantum effects at very low temperature and peculiar features of @xmath30 interaction .",
    "more sophisticated calculations with _ ab initio _ potential surface @xcite give a quantitative agreement with the experimental data for a lot of e1 transitions .",
    "recently , the first data on hyperfine structure of the @xmath31 state of the @xmath32 were obtained by a laser - microwave - laser resonance method @xcite .",
    "the central frequencies of microwave m1-transitions , @xmath33 ghz and @xmath34 ghz , are in excellent agreement ( @xmath35 ppm ) with the recent calculations for the isolated @xmath32 system @xcite .",
    "the results suppose that the density shifts of the m1 spectral lines at the experimental conditions are very small and do not exceed the experimental accuracy ( @xmath36 khz ) , in contrast with the @xmath37 transitions .",
    "however the width of the lines ( @xmath38 mhz ) leaves room for a collisional broadening .",
    "one more consequence of the data is that the mean time of the collisional relaxation @xmath39 ns , the latter number being the observation time window .",

    "the method of coupled channels consists in the solution of the finite system of coupled differential equations , which is obtained from the total schroedinger equation by developing a total wave function into a restricted set of the basis channel states .",
    "the number of the equation in this system is defined by the number of different states of the antiprotonic atom included into consideration and by the number of different partial waves of relative motion of colliding atoms at the given kinetic energy . that is necessary to get the reasonable cross sections .",

    "the most interesting collisional transitions are those that change relative populations of upper ( 4 and 3 ) and lower ( 2 and 1 ) groups of the levels .",
    "we have noted in introduction that it follows from the experiment that a relaxation time of the populations has to be of order or greater than a time gate between two laser pulses , i.e. , 140 ns .",
