    "the term allee effect refers to a certain process that leads to decreasing net population growth with decreasing density @xcite . in case",
    "the growth rate becomes negative at low density , this monotone relationship results in the existence of a so - called allee threshold below which populations are at high risk of being driven toward extinction .",
    "this phenomenon may be due to various ecological factors : failure to locate mates , inbreeding depression , failure to satiate predators , lack of cooperative feeding , etc .",
    "research on this topic is copious and is reviewed in  @xcite but rigorous mathematical analyses of stochastic spatial models that include an allee effect are much more limited .    in the model proposed by borrello  @xcite ,",
    "each site of the infinite regular lattice represents a patch that can host a local population , and a strong allee effect is included in the form of a varying individual death rate taking a larger value for local populations below some threshold .",
    "the model is used to show that , when only small flocks of individuals can migrate from patch to patch , the metapopulation goes extinct whereas survival is possible if large enough flocks of individuals can migrate .",
    "the framework of interacting particle systems has also been used in  @xcite to study the consequence of an allee effect . there , the model is a modification of the averaging process that also includes a threshold : local populations below this threshold go extinct whereas local populations above this threshold expand to their carrying capacity , each at rate one .",
    "the key component in this work is the topology of the network of interactions rather than the size of the migrating flocks , and the analysis of the process starting from a single occupied patch on various graphs indicates that the probability of long - term survival of the metapopulation decreases to zero as the degree of the network of interactions increases to infinity .",
    "this result suggests that long range dispersal promotes extinction of metapopulations subject to a strong allee effect .",
    "the modeling approach of the present paper is somewhat different .",
    "the model we propose is a version of the contact process with sexual reproduction  @xcite on a graph that includes two levels of interactions modeling metapopulations : individuals are produced within each patch at a rate proportional to the number of pairs of individuals in the patch rather than a rate proportional to the number of individuals in the patch .",
    "this birth mechanism ( sexual reproduction ) reflects the difficulty to locate mates in patches at low density , which has been identified by ecologists as one of the most common causes of allee effect .",
    "in particular , while the allee effect is forced into the model in the form of a threshold parameter in  @xcite , it is on the contrary naturally induced by the birth mechanism in the model considered in this paper .",
    "a useful consequence of this fact is both our model and its mean - field equations have a dual process , moreover the stochastic model s dual process is a straightforward truncation of the mean - field s dual process . with this relationship in hand , we can easily estimate the occupation density of each patch in the stochastic process by the solutions to the mean - field equations , and using block constructions , we can show the following . when a localized population spreads in the mean - field equations , we have survival of the stochastic process and existence of a non - trivial stationary distribution . when a localized low - density region erodes the surrounding population in the mean - field equations ,",
    "the same occurs in the stochastic process and implies weak convergence to the vacant configuration .",
    "we analyze survival and extinction starting from either a large block of occupied patches , or a single occupied patch , and also assess the dependence of survival on the dispersal range .",
    "each integer  @xmath0 represents a patch that can host a local population of up to  @xmath1 individuals , and we think of each site as a set of spatial locations that can be either empty or occupied by one individual . by convention",
    ", we use bold letters to denote these spatial locations : @xmath2 are the possible spatial locations at site / patch @xmath3 .",
    "the model we consider is a continuous - time markov chain whose state at time @xmath4 is a spatial configuration @xmath5 each individual dies at rate one .",
    "offspring produced at a given patch are sent to a spatial location chosen uniformly at random from either the parents patch or a neighboring patch . in either case ,",
    "offspring are produced at a rate proportional to  @xmath1 times the fraction of pairs of spatial locations which are occupied and the birth is suppressed if the target is already occupied . the proportionality constant is denoted by  @xmath6 for offspring sent within their parents patch and by  @xmath7 for offspring sent outside their parents patch .",
    "sexual reproduction is modeled by the fact that the birth rate is related to the number of occupied pairs and the reason for multiplying by  @xmath1 is to have births and deaths occurring at the same time scale . for simplicity",
    ", we consider symmetric interval neighborhoods but most of the basic facts , and some of the estimates , are true for any translation - invariant neighborhood , on @xmath8 or on more general transitive graphs .",

    "we shall call this process the _ microscopic representation_. to study this model , it is convenient to also consider its _ mesoscopic representation _ that keeps track of the metapopulation at the patch level rather than at the individual level .",
    "this new process is simply obtained by setting @xmath20 in words , the process counts the number of individuals at each patch .",

    "the analysis of the stochastic process   is more challenging due to the complexity of the birth mechanism .",
    "our approach is to use duality techniques to show that , at least in bounded space - time regions and when  @xmath1 is large , the stochastic process can be well approximated by the system of coupled differential equations for  @xmath26 , called the _ mean - field equations _ , given by @xmath27 the long - term behavior of the process can then be deduced from properties of the mean - field equations combined with block constructions .    * the mean - field equations *  starting from  @xmath28 constant , the profile  @xmath29 remains constant across space at all times and solves the single differential equation @xmath30 some basic algebra shows that    * when  @xmath31 , there is a unique equilibrium , namely  0 , * when  @xmath32 , we have the pair of equilibria : 0 and 1/2 , * when  @xmath33 , there are three equilibria : 0 , @xmath34 with 0 and  @xmath35 stable and  @xmath36 unstable .",

    "moreover , if  @xmath31 we shall say that retreat occurs , since then the conclusion of the upcoming theorem  [ th : ode - spread ] holds for any  @xmath46 .",
    "expansion implies that starting from a large enough occupied block of patches , the population spreads at a linear rate .",
    "retreat implies the opposite : starting from a large enough vacant block of patches , the population dies out within a region that grows linearly in time .",

    "then , for all  @xmath1 large , the stochastic process converges in distribution to the point mass at  @xmath60 .    to answer an important ecological question , namely , whether an alien species established in one patch either successfully spreads in space or is doomed to extinction , we now study the probability of long - term survival for the process starting with a single fully occupied patch , that is the process starting from the initial configuration @xmath63 from now on , we let  @xmath64 denote the law of the process starting from this configuration . relying again on properties of the system   together with duality techniques and block constructions , we obtain the following sufficient condition for successful invasion .",
    "note the conditions on the birth rates are slightly stronger than for expansion , since we want the population to spread starting from a _ single _ occupied patch and not just from a sufficiently large finite block .",
    " [ th : spread ] assume that  @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath65    finally , we study he dependence of survival on the dispersal range  @xmath11 .",
    "theorem  [ th : retreat ] shows that extinction occurs starting from any configuration when the birth parameters are small enough and the patch capacity is large . in contrast , our last theorem focuses on the process starting with a single fully occupied patch , in which case , regardless of the birth rates and the capacity of the patches , extinction occurs with probability close to one when the dispersal range is sufficiently large .    ",
    "[ th : range ] for all @xmath11 large , we have @xmath66    there are three different estimates because the survival probability is related to the time to extinction of a patch in isolation , which scales differently depending on whether the inner birth rate is subcritical , critical or supercritical . in either case , the theorem shows that the survival probability decreases to zero as the dispersal range increases to infinity , indicating that long range dispersal promotes extinction of metapopulations subject to a strong allee effect caused by sexual reproduction .",
    "in particular , the effects of dispersal are somewhat opposite for the process with and without sexual reproduction since , as proved in  @xcite , in the presence of long range dispersal , the basic contact process approaches a branching process with critical values for survival significantly smaller than that of the process with nearest neighbor interactions .",
