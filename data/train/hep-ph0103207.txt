    "the phenomenology of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) neutrinos and their detection @xcite depends on the neutrino - nucleon total cross section , which has been calculated in the standard model in refs .",
    "a striking feature of all of these predictions is the continued power - law - like growth of the cross sections with @xmath1 at the highest energies .",
    "this rise with @xmath1 is directly related to the very - low-@xmath2 behaviour of the nucleon parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , which must be extrapolated below the regime of the current hera data @xcite .",
    "it has even been argued @xcite that cosmic ray events will soon require a cross section even larger than that given by the standard calculations .",
    "on the other hand , unitarity relates the total scattering cross section to the forward scattering amplitude . for neutrino - nucleon scattering , in contrast to electron - nucleon scattering",
    ", the forward amplitude can be determined and used to bound the total cross section .",
    "this bound , based on lowest order perturbation theory in the weak coupling , is independent of the pdf s and implies that the inelastic cross section can not rise indefinitely .",
    "in fact , it can not rise for more than about two decades in energy above the region now covered by hera .",
    "thus , either there will need to be a dramatic change in the way parton distribution functions scale not too far above the hera data , or the assumption of weak perturbation theory is wrong . in either case",
    "the inelastic cross section will likely be very different at high @xmath1 than what is predicted in the references above .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the relation between the cross section at high @xmath1 and the low @xmath2 behavior of the distribution functions . in section 3",
    "we derive our bound and section 4 contains conclusions .",
    "at ultrahigh neutrino energies the total cross section is completely dominated by its deep inelastic component . the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross section can be evaluated within the qcd - improved parton model , employing the universal parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the nucleon @xcite which are derived from fitting photon - exchange dominated dis measurements .",
    "most important for high energies are the recent hera low-@xmath2 measurements @xcite , because uhe neutrino cross sections receive a dominant contribution from the ultrasmall-@xmath2 region of dis  even below the range covered by hera .",
    "the total neutrino - nucleon cross section is given by @xmath3 with the standard ( weak ) dis cross section of the form ; explicit @xmath4 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ intsig ] ) are negligible @xmath5 . ] @xmath6\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "the effective quark and anti - quark distributions @xmath8 and @xmath9 include the appropriate ( electro-)weak couplings for charged or neutral current dis . in what follows we will always assume an isoscalar nucleus @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "note , that eq .",
    "( [ intsig ] ) is well behaved only for neutrino dis where  contrary to the case of photon exchange  the heavy vector meson propagator in eq.([diffsig ] ) is non - singularfew gev '' cut - off on the integral in ( [ intsig ] ) changes its value only marginally .",
    "] at @xmath11 . accordingly",
    ", the following arguments are tied to the weak interaction framework , with no analogue for the more familiar photon exchange process . for explicit calculations",
    "we restrict ourselves to neutrino , rather than anti - neutrino , scattering , with the understanding that sea - quark dominance in the uhe limit does not discriminate between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "recent evaluations of uhe cross sections have extrapolated pdf s below @xmath12 using power laws @xcite , radiative renormalization group behaviour @xcite or bfkl - type resummations @xcite . within the accuracy required for astrophysical phenomenology these approaches",
    "agree and predict a steep rise of the low-@xmath2 parton density functions .",
    "any flattening of the pdf s at low @xmath2 due to gluon recombination is naively expected to be absent at the uhe scale @xmath13 due to the higher twist nature @xmath14 of such recombination channels @xcite .    to gain a feeling for the interplay between the uhe cross section and the low-@xmath2 behaviour of the pdf s we can perform the @xmath15 integral under the approximation that we neglect the evolution of the pdf s .",
    "we find @xmath16\\ , \\label{intoutq}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and the pdf s are evaluated at some fixed scale ( _ i.e. _ @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . from ( [ intoutq ] )",
    "it is straightforward to show that assumed behaviour of the pdf s at @xmath20 determines the @xmath21 asymptotic behaviour of the total cross section @xcite : a power - type @xmath20 behaviour @xmath22 @xcite of the sea - quark pdf translates into a power - type rise with energy @xmath23 .",
    "renormalization group evolution from a flat low - scale input @xcite gives rise to a slower , but still significant , growth with energy .",
    "this is easiest to see in the double - leading - logarithm approximation @xcite , in which the cross section can be seen analytically @xcite to rise less fast than any power but faster than a logarithm .",
    "although each of the different approximations of the small-@xmath2 behaviour gives different quantitative predictions of the @xmath21 asymptotics , we observe in fig.[bound ] that they agree to a good approximation up to energies as high as @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , they all rise continuously with energy .",
    "this rise , which is a direct consequence of the @xmath25 behaviour of @xmath26 , reflects mainly the hera measurements of @xmath27 at small-@xmath2 .",
    "the question is , therefore , up to what energy is the rise of @xmath28 strictly required by these data ?",
    "the @xmath29 collider hera runs at a center of mass energy of @xmath30 corresponding to an equivalent neutrino energy of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , leaving theoretical extrapolations aside , @xmath28 for @xmath32 is not completely unknown because hera probes the _ differential _ @xmath33 in eq.([diffsig ] ) down to much lower @xmath2 ( corresponding to higher @xmath1 ) than the average @xmath34 in the _ integrated _",
    "@xmath35 , albeit at a lower scale @xmath36 for the @xmath37-exchange process .",
    "hence , the maximal @xmath1 up to which the evaluation of @xmath28 according to eqs.([intsig ] ) and ( [ diffsig ] ) is fixed by hera depends on the extent to which we trust the nlo qcd scale - evolution of dis structure functions .",
    "recent estimates @xcite of nnlo corrections to parton evolution confirm a trustworthy stability of the full singlet evolution at least down to @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "this latter kinematical range is well covered by hera and the corresponding data are incorporated in the pdf sets of refs.@xcite . assuming nothing more ) . ]",
    "than the universality of the pdf s and the validity of the rge within @xmath40 , we can then consider @xmath28  if evaluated according to eqs.([intsig ] ) and ( [ diffsig ] )  as _ effectively _ covered by hera data up to neutrino energies where @xmath28 becomes sensitive to @xmath12 .",
    "this sets in smoothly above @xmath41 , which we indicate by the vertical line in fig .",
    "1 . note , this is a very conservative estimate of the impact of the hera data . were we to trust the pdf - mediated mapping of the hera measurements onto the neutrino cross - section down to @xmath42 , and rely on the evolution from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , then the most recent hera data @xcite would cover @xmath28 at @xmath0 except for a correction of @xmath45 from @xmath46 . as we will deduce in the next section , this would suggest hera @xmath47-exchange data are already probing a perturbative unitarity bound in uhe neutrino scattering",
    ". however , for now , we prefer not to speculate about shifting the vertical line in fig .  1 to the right . a detailed statistical analysis ,",
    "though , might do better and provide stringent correlations between hera data and @xmath28 at even higher @xmath48 .",
    "note , our limitation @xmath49 is also a safe condition for the absence of recombination corrections @xcite at hera scales which are , accordingly , even more negligible at the uhe scale @xmath50 .",
    "using unitarity of the @xmath51-matrix , we can relate the total @xmath52 cross section in ( [ intsig ] ) to the imaginary part of the neutrino - nucleon forward scattering amplitude : @xmath53\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the standard mandelstam variables .",
    "the elastic amplitude @xmath56 is related to the elastic cross section @xmath57 combining eqs .",

    "@xmath59 ^ 2\\ , \\label{spins}\\ ] ] where the sum is over spin and isospin of the nucleon .",
    "thus , we can just as well use the spin / isospin averaged cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) ) to be negligible in the high energy limit . ] .    the inequality in eq.([limit ] ) is a standard statement of the optical theorem and can be found in many textbooks .",
    "it follows strictly from the positivity of @xmath60 and does not rely on any perturbative expansion .",
    "we now consider its implications in the context of a perturbative calculation in the weak coupling .",
    "expanding the elastic amplitude to lowest power in the weak coupling @xmath61 and using the most general @xmath62-nucleon coupling ( see fig.[secondorder ] ) , we obtain @xmath63 & & \\left.+ i \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}\\ , \\gamma_5\\ , q^\\beta\\ , g_2 ( q^2 ) +   q_\\alpha\\ , \\gamma_5\\ , g_3(q^2 ) \\right]\\ ,   u_{n}(p ) + { \\cal{o}}(g^4)\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the forward direction only the form factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 contribute . using the standard model @xmath62-boson current and isospin symmetry",
    ", the values of the form factors at @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of the nucleon isospin operator @xmath67 and charge operator @xmath68 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the measured value @xcite of the axial vector coupling constant .",
    "for an isoscalar nucleus we obtain @xmath72 \\,.\\ ] ] accordingly , the inequality eq.([limit ] ) gives @xmath73 the value on the right - hand side of eq.([value ] ) is shown as a horizontal line in fig.[bound ] .",
    "we observe that the inequality is violated for @xmath74 .",
    "note that the precise value of the bound is rather insensitive to the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 because it depends on the square root of the factor in the square brackets of eq.([sigel ] ) .",
    "hera information on pdf s determines @xmath28 for neutrino energies as high as @xmath75 .",
    "perhaps large changes in the pdf s will set in within the range of @xmath2 appropriate for @xmath76 such that the bound is respected for larger @xmath1 .",
    "these corrections would presumably arise as a softening of the gluon and sea quark distributions at small @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , one can note that the bound eq.([value ] ) is obtained by comparing an @xmath77 expression for @xmath28 with an @xmath78 expression for the forward elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "since unitarity is an order - by - order statement within perturbation theory , to be strictly rigorous we must also include the absorptive @xmath79 contribution to the forward scattering amplitude . in this way",
    ", unitarity in the ultrahigh energy limit can in principle be restored , but at the cost of large @xmath80 corrections to the forward amplitude .    for illustration , we write the elastic amplitude symbolically as @xmath81 where we have calculated the @xmath82 part above and the @xmath83 term results from the exchange of a pair of virtual @xmath84 s or @xmath85 s in the elastic scattering , as illustrated in fig.[fourthorder ] .",
    "using this notation @xmath86 + g^8 \\left [ \\left ( { \\rm re}[t^{(4)}]\\right)^2 + \\left ( { \\rm i m } [ t^{(4)}]\\right)^2 + \\ldots\\right]+ \\ldots\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath87\\right)^2 + \\ldots\\,.\\ ] ] from these equations we see that the unitarity condition eq.([limit ] ) can be satisfied ; however it requires that the _ higher order _",
    "@xmath88 term become larger than the _ lower order _",
    "@xmath89 term in the high energy limit .",
    "so , in this approach , calculating to lowest order in the weak coupling @xmath61 is not a good approximation for the elastic differential cross section at high energy .",
    "but if the perturbation expansion is unreliable in eq.([diffpert ] ) , then it is also reasonable to expect higher order corrections to im@xmath90 to be larger than the term shown , both in eq.([diffpert ] ) and in eq.([totpert ] ) .",
    "since this is the term on which all calculations have been based it implies that these calculations may not be reliable at very high energies . if the perturbation expansion does nt work in eq.([diffpert ] ) then we must question its validity in eq.([totpert ] ) .",
    "we compared perturbative predictions for neutrino - nucleon total cross sections at ultrahigh neutrino energies to a unitarity bound derived from the corresponding elastic neutrino scattering amplitude in the forward direction . at the non - perturbative",
    "level the bound is absolutely stringent .",
    "a lowest order expansion in powers of the weak coupling leads to a bound which is saturated at an energy surprisingly close to what is effectively covered by hera measurements .",
    "thus , for the largest energies relevant to neutrino astronomy , sizable pdf corrections could reside in @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , the large apparent @xmath80 total cross section should manifest itself through the corresponding term in the elastic amplitude as well .",
    "but if the perturbation expansion is not valid for the elastic amplitude how can we trust it for the inelastic cross section ? in this case also @xmath28 could be very different for large @xmath1 than the curves shown in fig.[bound ] .",
    "we have ignored the possibility that unitarity is satisfied by a new interaction  physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "but even in this alternative our basic conclusions remain the same : something dramatic must happen at energies close to the current energy and the existing calculations of @xmath28 should not be trusted at large neutrino energy",
    ".    if the bound is correct , and the pdf s change at low @xmath2 , then @xmath91 will be smaller at high @xmath1 than what is shown in fig.[bound ] .",
    "if perturbation theory has broken down then @xmath28 could be anything - perhaps even large enough to explain the cosmic ray data without the need for new physics . or",
    "perhaps the values shown in fig.[bound ] could turn out to be correct ; maybe weak perturbation theory only breaks down for the elastic cross section . without a better knowledge of the pdf s at low @xmath2",
