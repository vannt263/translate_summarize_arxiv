    "a qca , beyond its many - body character , is inherently a ( quantum ) optical system , thus is naturally probed by light scattering @xcite .",
    "performing quantum measurements on the output ( transported / scattered ) light , one obtains information about the underlying properties of the system @xcite . in the study of qca simulators , the driving source has so far mostly been taken to be a coherent field of light described within a quantum master equation formalism .",

    "how does a qca many body simulator react to general quantum input fields ?",
    "can we collect information on the states of the many - body models simulated by studying the transported / scattered quantum particles ( photons ) from a qca ?    to answer this question , we employ the lippmann - schwinger formalism , whose use in quantum optical systems was pioneered by shen and fan @xcite and led to numerous further developments @xcite . in the context of quantum simulations of many - body phenomena , using an @xmath0-photon fock state as the input field for an @xmath0-site cavity array seems promising . as a first step towards this goal , we examine the process of scattering two photons on an array of coupled kerr nonlinear resonators whose dynamics are described by the bose - hubbard model .",
    "we first evaluate the scattering matrix analytically for the case of two resonators coupled to input and output waveguides , and then use it to calculate the scattering probabilities and the second - order correlations between the scattered photons .",

    "we see that when driven by the respective two - photon eigenenergies ( three circles ) , the fully - resonant case ( solid curves ) generally excites the desired eigenstates more efficiently than the identical - photon input case ( dashed curves ) .",

    "the figure also hints that the probabilities at @xmath112 and @xmath113 approach the same value above @xmath114 .",
