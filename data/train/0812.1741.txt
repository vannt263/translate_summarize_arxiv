    "we will show that the strongly coupled component of the cqgp contributes significantly to the thermodynamics across the transition whether in the energy density , pressure or entropy density . in section 2 , we derive the excess energy of the cqgp for small @xmath1 in the one - loop approximation . in section 3 , we use ideas from classical electromagnetic plasmas to interpolate between the one - loop result at low @xmath1 and the molecular dynamics results at large @xmath1 for the su(2 ) cqgp .",
