    "one of the central results in social choice theory states that every non - trival social choice function ( scf)a function mapping individual preferences to a collective choice  is susceptible to strategic manipulation @xcite",
    ". however , the classic result by @xcite and @xcite only applies to _ resolute _ , single - valued , scfs .",
    "the notion of a resolute scf is rather restricted and artificial .",
    "is a rather restrictive and unnatural assumption . '' in a similar vein , @xcite writes that `` the gibbard - satterthwaite theorem on the impossibility of nondictatorial , strategy - proof social choice uses an assumption of singlevaluedness which is unreasonable '' . ] for example , consider a situation with two voters and two alternatives such that each voter prefers a different alternative .",
    "the problem is not that a resolute scf has to pick a single alternative ( which is a well - motivated practical requirement ) , but that it has to pick a single alternative _",
    "based on the individual preferences alone _ ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , resoluteness is at variance with elementary notions of fairness such as neutrality and anonymity .    in order to remedy this shortcoming",
    ", @xcite went on to characterize the class of strategyproof _ decision schemes _ , aggregation functions that yield probability distributions over the set of alternatives rather than single alternatives ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this class consists of rather degenerate decision schemes and gibbard s characterization is therefore commmonly interpreted as another impossibility result . however , gibbard s theorem rests on unusually strong assumptions with respect to the voters preferences .",
    "in contrast to the traditional setup in social choice theory , which typically only involves ordinal preferences , his result relies on the axioms of @xcite ( or an equivalent set of axioms ) in order to compare lotteries over alternatives .    the gap between gibbard and satterthwaite s theorem for resolute scfs and gibbard s theorem for decision schemes has been filled by a number of impossibility results with varying underlying notions of how to compare sets of alternatives with each other @xcite , many of which are surveyed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we will be concerned with the weakest ( and therefore least controversial ) preference extension from alternatives to sets due to @xcite . according to this definition , a set of alternatives is weakly preferred to another set of alternatives if all elements of the former are weakly preferred to all elements of the latter . @xcite and @xcite have shown independently that all non - trival scfs that are rationalizable via a quasi - transitive preference relation are manipulable in this model .",
    "@xcite concludes his paper by contemplating that `` one plausible interpretation of such a theorem is that , rather than demonstrating the impossibility of reasonable strategy - proof social choice functions , it is part of a critique of the regularity [ rationalizability ] conditions '' and @xcite states that `` whether a nonrationalizable collective choice rule exists which is not manipulable and always leads to nonempty choices for nonempty finite issues is an open question . '' also referring to nonrationalizable choice functions , @xcite writes : `` it is an open question how far nondictatorship can be strengthened in this sort of direction and still avoid impossibility results . ''",
    "the first result of this paper is negative and shows that no condorcet extension is strategyproof .",
    "the proof , however , crucially depends on strategic tie - breaking and hence does not work for strict preferences .",
    "we therefore turn to scfs that can not be manipulated by groups of voters who misrepresent the _ strict _ part of their preference relation and show that all scfs that satisfy a new variant of maskin - monotonicity called _ set - monotonicity _ are group - strategyproof in this sense .",
    "set - monotonicity requires the invariance of choice sets under the weakening of unchosen alternatives and is only satisfied by a handful of scfs such as the _ top cycle _ , the _ minimal covering set _ , and",
    "the _ bipartisan set_. strategyproofness ( according to kelly s preference extension ) thus draws a sharp line within the space of scfs as many established scfs ( such as plurality , borda s rule , and all weak condorcet extensions ) are known to be manipulable for strict preferences ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "we furthermore show that our characterization is complete for _ pairwise _ scfs , scfs whose outcome only depends on the comparisons between pairs of alternatives .",
    "since set - monotonicity coincides with maskin - monotonicity in the context of resolute scfs , our characterization can thus be seen as a generalization of the @xcite theorem within the domain of pairwise scfs .",
    "we conclude the paper by pointing out that voters can never benefit from abstaining strategyproof pairwise scfs .",
    "this does not hold for _ resolute _ condorcet extensions , which is commonly known as the _ no - show paradox _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite s conservative preference extension has previously been primarily invoked in _ impossibility _ theorems because it is independent of the voters attitude towards risk and the mechanism that eventually picks a single alternative from the choice set .",
    "its interpretation in positive results , such as in this paper , is more debatable .",
    "@xcite has shown that @xcite s extension is appropriate in a probabilistic context when voters are unaware of the lottery that will be used to pick the winning alternative .",
    "( whether they are able to attach utilities to alternatives or not does not matter . )",
    "alternatively , one can think of an independent chairman or a black - box that picks alternatives from choice sets in a way that prohibits a meaningful prior distribution . whether these assumptions can be reasonably justified or such a device can actually be built",
    "is open to discussion . in particular , the study of distributed protocols or computational selection devices that justify kelly s extension appears to be promising .",
    "in this section , we provide the terminology and notation required for our results .",
