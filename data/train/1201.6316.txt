    "recent advances in magnetic imaging techniques , as well as the development of novel types of electronic devices that utilize electronic spin ( rather than charge ) as an information carrier , have renewed interest in understanding mechanisms of spin noise and spin relaxation . while conventional experimental methods , such as nuclear or electron spin resonance and related techniques @xcite , probe the temporal evolution of spin correlations , they typically do not provide much information on spatial correlations between neighboring spins . on the contrary ,",
    "the new approaches to spin resonance , such as magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) , combine capabilities of the usual magnetic resonance techniques with the sensitivity of atomic force microscopy .",
    "that is , one can now observe not only the time ( frequency ) dependence of spin correlations , but also their spatial dispersion with an atomic - scale resolution .",
    "hence , there is a clear need to develop theoretical tools for the description of such correlations in systems of interest , that is , in systems of _ interacting _ spins .",
    "the spatial correlations in interacting spin systems are believed to be controlled by the so - called _ flip - flop _ processes .",
    "that is , two neighboring interacting spins can exchange magnetization , i.e. , the values of their spin components can change by @xmath0 , so that the total spin of the pair is conserved .",
    "such exchange gives rise to the diffusion of spin magnetization , provided the dynamics of the flip - flops is poissonian @xcite .",
    "typical calculations of the effective diffusion constant utilize the method of moments , where the line - width is approximated by a gaussian or lorentzian shape@xcite",
    ". such approximations are not very well controlled .",
    "more recently several types of cluster / cummulant expansions have been proposed in connection with the problem of decoherence of localized electronic spins caused by the fluctuations of nuclear spins @xcite . in that problem",
    "though , the decoherence of electronic spins occurs on a timescale small compared to the typical nuclear timescale , which justifies the use of cluster expansions in the description of fluctuations in the nuclear subsystem .    in this paper",
    "we study correlations between spatially separated spins in the opposite , long time regime .",
    "such a regime is specifically relevant to the mrfm technique , which utilizes ( micro)mechanical cantilevers with ferromagnetic tips to probe magnetic fluctuations in the underlying samples .",
    "we propose an approach based on the markov approximation , similar to the frequently used bloch - redfield approximation@xcite in the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "that is , we consider all possible pairs @xmath1 of interacting spins , while other spins @xmath2 are treated as an environment , providing finite line - width for the flip - flop transitions through fluctuating magnetic fields ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] for a cartoon visualisation of these approximations ) . a self - consistency",
    "is then established between the flip - flop rates and the line - width so that our approach can be viewed as a sort of dynamical mean field approximation .",
    "we argue that our method is well justified , in particular , in the presence of an external strongly non - uniform magnetic field , which introduces separation between the timescales of the flip - flop rates and the correlation time for the fluctuations of the effective magnetic fields .",
    "note that such non - uniform magnetic fields are intrinsic to the mrfm setups , where field gradients are used to address specific spins located within the so - called resonance layer .     and",

    "we find that the flip - flop rates are strongly suppressed by the field gradient in the limit when the field gradient significantly exceeds the spin - spin interaction constant . in section [ relaxation ]",
    "we study the influence of spin - relaxation processes on spin flip - flops and derive the effective master equation for the magnetization in the presence of external noise sources acting on the spins .",
    "our main result of that section is that , while the field gradient suppresses the flip - flops , the noise may actually enhance these rates ; see eq .",

    "further work on this issue however , is still in progress , and the details deferred to a future publication .",
    "the model can be described in terms of simple physical principles , as illustrated in fig .",
    "interactions between sites @xmath9 and @xmath3 can cause spin _ flip - flopping _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath200 .",
    "this process occurs when sites @xmath9 and @xmath3 have opposite spin , and does not conserve energy when the external field gradient is nonzero ( due to the different zeeman energies ) .",
    "these sites @xmath9 and @xmath3 however , also interact with all other neighboring lattice sites ( the number of which is assumed to be large ) . a crucial approximation in our model",
    "is to treat all remaining sites as composing an effective bath , or rapidly fluctuating environment in which sites @xmath9 and @xmath3 inhabit [ see fig .  [ fig3 ] ( b ) ] . in this way",
    ", one can derive the rate at which the spin _ flip - flopping _ occurs ( we have labelled this quantity @xmath201 ) , and naturally it will depend on the bath parameters . to be more specific , it depends on the correlation functions between neighboring sites within the bath .",
    "the final step then is to determine the rate @xmath201 that is self - consistent with the bath , i.e. the value of @xmath201 which yields the _ same correlation function _ between neighboring sites , as that from which it was derived .",
    "we find the rate @xmath201 decays very quickly with increasing field gradient .",
    "equation   predicts the rate decays in the same way as a gaussian distribution . from a numerical study of the cubic heisenberg lattice ( presented in section  [ heisenberg ] )",
    ", we expect this prediction to be accurate for @xmath202 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this result implies that the observation of spin diffusion in systems with a very strong magnetic field gradient is likely to be difficult as the diffusion time - scales would be very large .    however , in section  [ relaxation ] we studied the influence of external noise on this rate .",
    "the presence of the external noise turns out to be favourable for increasing the diffusion rates .",
    "we made use of the same set of assumptions in deriving a second langevin equation [ see eq .  ] .",
    "in contrast to section  [ sec : model ] , the langevin equation now includes a decay - constant , denoted @xmath203 , which relaxes the system down into a state where the orientation of the magnetic moment is completely random , i.e. @xmath204 .",
    "spin flip - flops still occur in the system , and the rate at which they occur ; @xmath205 , is affected by the noise . as a general rule ,",
    "the rate @xmath205 increases with increasing noise , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the limiting case where the external noise is far greater than both the interaction coupling and the external field gradient",
    ", we find the rate @xmath201 decays in the same way as a cauchy - lorentz distribution , see eq .  .",
    "this predicted increase in the rate may help to explain experiments where diffusion has purportedly been observed in systems with very large magnetic field gradients .",

    "[ sec : model ] . in making this comparison",
    ", we see that the approximations we have applied in deriving the equation of motion   for @xmath140 amount to treating all sites other @xmath3 and @xmath19 as composing an effective bath ( equivalent to a fluctuating external field ) .",
    "for our particularly simple choice of @xmath228 , the integral equation we must solve is simply eq .   with @xmath110 given by eq .",
    ". from this equation",
    ", we wish to determine @xmath118 as a function of @xmath101 , the dependence on @xmath229 can be removed , by switching to variables @xmath230 and @xmath231 , such that we have @xmath232 we then search for a root of this equation , by iterating @xmath233 for @xmath234 up to convergence , which in our case was chosen to be @xmath235 . in order to choose a reasonable initial prediction for @xmath236 we begin the algorithm at @xmath237 , and define @xmath238",
    "once the algorithm has converged , we decrease @xmath101 by a small amount and use our previous prediction for @xmath239 as our new @xmath236 .",
    "as the field gradient decreases in a particular direction , the rate at which spin _ flip - flops _ occur in that particular direction increases , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is not clear , a priori , that the rate will remain finite in the limit of vanishing gradient .",

    "the quantity @xmath252 can be calculated numerically to be @xmath253 , thereby indicating that the slope of the rhs is @xmath254 for large @xmath118 . from this",
