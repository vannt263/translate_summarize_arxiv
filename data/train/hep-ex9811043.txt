    "heavy lepton ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) decays are mediated ( in the standard model ) by the charged weak current , carried by @xmath7 force bosons with a @xmath8 lorentz structure . as a consequence ,",

    "since @xmath25 events are produced with no net polarization at @xmath26 center - of - mass energies below the @xmath27 mass , the lepton momentum spectrum alone is not sensitive to the spin - dependent parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these latter parameters are measurable by analyzing the decays of both taus in an event . in addition",
    ", semi - hadronic tau decays permit the measurement of the parameter @xmath28 , sometimes referred to as the `` tau neutrino helicity '' , which takes the value @xmath29 in the @xmath8 sm .",
