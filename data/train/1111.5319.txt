    "in 1964 gell - mann and zweig independently proposed a quark model in which all known hadrons were described as bound states of only three fundamental particles @xcite .",
    "each of these spin-1/2 particles , which gell - mann named quarks , has their corresponding antiparticles . however , a precise mechanism of the bound states and quark confinement has still not been established .",
    "gell - mann s model requires that the valid quark states should be colorless and so a free quark is not allowed . since a free single quark has not yet been observed , the model assumes that quarks appear as bound states .",
    "the baryons are bound states of three quarks ( or antiquarks ) and the mesons are made up of one quark and one antiquark . as a model , to describe this behavior , one can think of a hadron as a cavity in which the quark wave function is confined , and the cavity is surrounded by the qcd vacuum @xcite . therefore in a simple model quarks confined in a sphere with radius @xmath6 and the dirac equation",
    "sould be solved within this sphere .    from this point of view",
    ", the solution of the dirac equation in a three - dimensional scalar potential , apart from its interesting theoretical aspects , provide useful tools for studying the properties of elementary particles .",
    "for example , the mit bag model @xcite and its charily invariant versions , such as the chiral bag model @xcite and the cloudy bag model @xcite , are some models for describing the physics of the nucleon and other baryons .",
    "a bag is a region of space in which quarks and gluons are confined , i.e. they are forced by an external constant pressure b , which can be fitted using experimentally determined hadron masses , to move only inside the bag .",
    "historically , chodos _ et .",
    "have considered the mit bag model through the dirac equation ( except the bag pressure b ) @xcite .",
    "they solved bag equations for the massless dirac fields in three space dimensions .",
    "their solutions are for the special case of static spherical boundary .",
    "they also computed charge radius and found it to be 1.0 fm .",
    "al . _ , in the other case of this model , calculated the masses and the static parameters of the light hadrons @xcite . in the cloudy bag model a baryon is treated as a three - quark bag that is surrounded by a cloud of pions .",
    "thomas _ et . al .",
    "_ investigated the static properties of the nucleon within this model @xcite .",
    "they found the bag radius to be about 0.8 fm by a fit to pion - nucleon scattering in the ( 3,3)-resonance region .",
    "the chiral bag model for the nucleon is a hybrid of quark and meson degrees of freedom , interpolating the two limits of the skyrme model at @xmath7 and the mit bag model at @xmath8 @xcite . in the skyrme model mesons acts as gauge particles so that baryons would interact with each other by the exchange of mesons @xcite .",
    "skyrmions are the solutions of the field equations",
    ". these solutions are solitons and no longer plain wave .",
    "one may interpret these skyrmions as coherent states of baryons and excited baryons @xcite ; however , the physical interpretation is still not completely resolved . with this model ,",
    "it is also possible to calculate nucleon masses and other particle properties @xcite .",
    "both the mit bag and skyrme model are useful to calculate masses and other properties of hadrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hosaka and toki investigated the static properties of the nucleon such as masses and magnetic moments as a function of @xmath6 , in both the original chiral bag model and models with vector mesons .",
    "the mit bag model introduces many free parameters for energy corrections that could be helpful in understanding the physical processes inside the nucleus .",
    "it is a curious and complex situation to solve the relativistic quantum mechanics problems in a finite potential in comparison with the equivalent problem in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . in the dirac equation , the wave function is continuous , its first derivative is discontinuous and the second derivative has a very large jump , whereas , in the schrdinger equation the wave function and its first derivative are continuous , but the second derivative has a certain jump related to the potential jump .",
    "the solutions of the dirac equation in a @xmath9 potential exist in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , for a finite spherical potential well , as far as we are aware of , there is no solution in the literature .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the solution of the dirac equation in a spherically symmetric scalar potential well , which is not necessarily infinite .",
    "the origin of this scalar potential could be a strong force that binds quarks together in clusters to make more familiar subatomic particles , such as protons and neutrons .",
    "it also holds together the atomic nucleus and underlies interactions between all particles containing quarks @xcite .",
    "although this model is not compatible with the quark confinement at finite potential , it could serve a dual purpose .",
    "first , one could observe the evolution of the wave functions as @xmath10 , where one could recover the mit bag model results .",
    "second , for finite values of @xmath11 this could serve as an effective model for the nucleus where @xmath5 is the effective single particle potential emerging from the meson exchange of the nucleons . here",
    "we obtain eigenvalue equations for the energies and numerically calculate the energy eigenvalues for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 states .",
    "these states are derived normally from the continuity of the wave function and imposing boundary conditions on the cavity @xcite , with different radii @xmath12 fm and the quark masses @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "we then , compare the values of the energy levels in each of specific conditions and also with the energy eigenvalue obtained in the previous mit bag model .",
    "the relation between energy eigenvalues and the radius of cavity and the mass of the quark is considered .",
    "we also obtain the dirac wave function components for a quark particle and depict them in figures . as a result ,",
    "when the strength of the potential is increased , the wave function components on the boundary of cavity fall down and it would have the sharper point , which are in good agreement with the mit bag model . finally , we obtain the magnitude of sharpness of the relativistic wave function component when crossing the wall .    the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] is devoted to an introduction of the dirac equation with a central scalar potential . in sec",
    "[ sec3 ] we calculate the energy eigenvalues for a dirac particle in a scalar potential with full spherical symmetry for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 states .",
    "then we discuss about the sharpness of the wave function components on the boundary",
    ". finally in sec [ sec4 ] we summarize our results .",
    "in the dirac equation , the scalar potential @xmath15 and the fourth component of a vector potential , @xmath16 are accompanied by mass @xmath17 and energy @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath16 is not a vector potential , since it is the fourth component of a four vector , it is called a vector potential .",
    "the general form of the equation of motion for a spin-@xmath19 particle with these two potential is ( in relativistic units , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) @xmath22\\psi ( x , t ) = i\\frac{\\partial } { { \\partial t}}\\psi ( x , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the three - dimensional momentum operator . in the above equation @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are the @xmath26 dirac matrices which , in the usual representation , are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 unit matrix .",
    "the subscript @xmath30 can take the values of 1,2,3 , and @xmath31 are the @xmath29 pauli matrices . for a dirac particle in a spherically symmetric potential field , the total angular momentum operator @xmath32 , and the spin - orbit matrix operator @xmath33 , commute with the dirac hamiltonian . here",
    "@xmath34 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the complete set of the conservative quantities with their eigenvalues can be written as follows : @xmath35 so that , @xmath36 = 0,\\qquad\\left [ { h,{j } } \\right ] = 0,\\qquad \\left [ { j^2 , j_3 } \\right ] = 0,\\qquad\\left [ { { j},k } \\right ] = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath37 therefor the quantum number @xmath38 is a nonzero integer number .",
    "given stationary solutions @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are real square - integrable functions , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be written in terms of the spherical harmonic functions with the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "then the two coupled equations for the radial parts of the dirac equation with a given scalar potential turn out to be , @xmath45    the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 7.1 ] ) for a scalar potential well , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are the spherical bessel functions and modified spherical bessel functions of the first kind , for the regions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively",
    ". therefore for region i , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and we have    [ 8 ] @xmath52    and for region ii , @xmath49 with @xmath53 ,    [ 10 ] @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the normalization factors @xcite .",
    "in this section we compute the energy eigenvalues for a dirac particle in a full spherically symmetric scalar potential .",
    "reported eigenvalues , for which the massless spin-@xmath19 field is confined to an infinite spherical potential well of radius @xmath59 fm , are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "these values have been computed through an equation of motion and boundary conditions @xcite ."
