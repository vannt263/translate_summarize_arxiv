    "perovskite structure oxides exhibit a wide range of low temperature structural distortions associated with lattice instabilities of the prototype cubic structure ( figure  [ perovskite ] ) , including ferroelectric ( e.g. pbtio@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 ) , antiferroelectric ( e.g. pbzro@xmath0 ) and antiferrodistortive ( e.g. srtio@xmath0 ) .",
    "both first- and second - order transitions are observed , with a full spectrum of transition behavior ranging from displacive to order - disorder .",
    "the strong coupling between the electric polarization and the structural distortions has led to the widespread use of perovskites such as lead zirconium titanate ( pzt ) in piezoelectric transducer and actuator applications@xcite .    in _ magnetic _ perovskites , different microscopic orientations of the spin - polarized ions give rise to different macroscopic magnetic symmetries .",
    "this results in rich phase diagrams , in which both the magnetic order and the structure depend on the temperature , pressure and chemical composition . a large amount of recent research activity @xcite has been focused on the rare earth perovskite - structure manganites , following the observation of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in ca - doped lamno@xmath0@xcite . during these recent studies , many rare earth perovskite manganites have been found to show strong coupling between their magnetic and structural , or magnetic and electronic order parameters .",
    "for example , a magnetically induced structural phase transition has been observed in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0@xcite indicating strong coupling between the local magnetic spin moments and the lattice structure . in nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath0 , strong coupling between the magnetic spin moments and the electronic charge carriers",
    "was demonstrated when an electronic metal - insulator transition was induced by an external magnetic field@xcite . the large change in conductivity with applied magnetic field , which gives these materials potential technological importance as the read element in magnetic recording heads@xcite ,",
    "is believed to originate from a similar type of phase transition@xcite .",
    "materials which have strong coupling between _ all three _ of the magnetic , electric and structural order parameters , resulting in simultaneous ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity , are known as multiferroics .",
    "most multiferroic materials are complex structures with many atoms per formula unit , and more than one formula unit per unit cell . the large number of inter - ionic interactions has prevented isolation of the essential factors causing multiferroicity . as a result , the origin of multiferroism and the nature of the coupling between the magnetic , electric polarization , and structural order parameters are not well understood . in spite of the lack of fundamental understanding ,",
    "a number of device applications have been suggested for multiferroic materials including multiple state memory elements , electric field controlled ferromagnetic resonance devices , and variable transducers with either magnetically modulated piezoelectricity or electrically modulated piezomagnetism@xcite . also , the ability to couple with _ either _ the magnetic _ or _ the electric polarization offers an extra degree of freedom in the design of conventional actuators , transducers and storage devices .",
    "bismuth manganite can be regarded as the `` hydrogen atom '' of multiferroics .",
    "although information about bimno@xmath0 is sparse@xcite , indications are that it is simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric at low temperatures , and , because it has a simple structure , it is amenable to detailed study using first - principles techniques .",
    "investigation of bimno@xmath0 permits the study of the essentials of multiferroism without the problems associated with simulating compounds containing many atoms per formula unit .",
    "in addition , bimno@xmath0 is strikingly different , both magnetically and structurally , from the rare earth perovskite manganites .",
    "bimno@xmath0 is ferromagnetic with a triclinic structural distortion in its ground state , whereas the rare earth manganites are antiferromagnetic and either orthorhombic or hexagonal .",
    "the differences are unexpected because bismuth and the rare earths all form trivalent cations with similar ionic radii .",
    "the anomalous behavior of bimno@xmath0 compared with conventional perovskite manganites could give rise to unusual and useful transport properties .",
    "the goal of the study described in this paper is to determine the origin of the differences between bimno@xmath0 and the other perovskite manganites , both to understand the fundamental physics , and to assist in the optimization of perovskite manganite materials for novel device applications .",
    "to achieve this goal we evaluate electronic and magnetic properties of perovskite manganites using a plane wave pseudopotential ( pwpp ) implementation of density functional theory ( dft ) within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "our choice of theoretical approach is influenced by successful first - principles studies of _ non - magnetic _ perovskite ferroelectrics@xcite .",
    "the origin of ferroelectricity in the prototypical ferroelectric perovskites pbtio@xmath0 and",
    "batio@xmath0 , and the reasons for the differences between them , were deduced using first principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations@xcite .",
    "it was shown in both cases that ti @xmath4 - o @xmath5 hybridization is essential for ferroelectricity . in batio@xmath0 ,",
    "the ba@xmath6 ions are almost entirely ionically bonded , resulting in a rhombohedral structure . in pbtio@xmath0 , however , the pb @xmath7 electrons are partially covalently bonded with the oxygen @xmath5 electrons , favoring a tetragonal structure .    throughout this work , we use lamno@xmath0 as our example of a typical rare earth manganite , and compare our calculated results for bimno@xmath0 with those for lamno@xmath0 . since bi is adjacent to pb , near the right hand side of the periodic table , and la is adjacent to ba on the left hand side , we anticipate by analogy with the earlier pbtio@xmath0-batio@xmath0 study , that the high lying occupied bi @xmath7 electrons will contribute to the structural and magnetic differences between bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 .",
    "in addition we will find significant hybridization between the bi @xmath8 and o @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ theorysection ] we describe the plane wave pseudopotential lsda implementation of density functional theory which we use for this study .",
    "our pwpp implementation is shown to give results which are in excellent agreement with previously published all electron calculations for magnetic perovskite oxides . in section  [ results ] our results for bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 are presented .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the calculations described in this work were performed using a plane wave pseudopotential implementation@xcite of density functional theory@xcite within the local spin density approximation .",
    "plane wave basis sets offer many advantages in total energy calculations for solids , including completeness , an unbiased representation , and arbitrarily good convergence accuracy .",
    "they also allow for straightforward mathematical formulation and implementation , which is essential in the calculation of hellmann - feynman forces@xcite and in density functional perturbation theory calculations@xcite .",
    "however plane wave basis sets necessitate the use of pseudopotentials to model the electron - ion interaction , in order to avoid rapid oscillations of the valence wavefunctions in the region around the ion cores .",
    "the accuracy and efficiency of _ ab initio _ pseudopotential calculations ( compared with all electron calculations ) is now well established for non - magnetic systems@xcite , but application of the method to spin - polarized magnetic systems is still in its infancy . traditionally , magnetic materials containing transition metals have been studied using all electron methods with mixed basis sets , such as the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw)@xcite , linear muffin tin orbital@xcite or korringa - kohn - rostoker@xcite approaches .",
    "resistance to the use of the pwpp method to study these systems has been based on two perceived difficulties :    \\1 ) first , the magnetic properties of the transition metals and their compounds originate from tightly bound @xmath9-electrons , which might be expected to require a prohibitively large number of plane waves to expand their pseudopotentials . this problem can be overcome by using the optimized pseudopotentials developed by rappe et al.@xcite .",
    "optimized pseudopotentials minimize the kinetic energy in the high fourier components of the pseudo wavefunction , leading to a corresponding reduction in the contribution of high fourier components in the solid .",
    "the use of optimized pseudopotentials reduces the energy cut - off of the plane wave expansion in transition metal solids to around 60 ry or less .",
    "\\2 ) second , implicit within the pseudopotential approximation is the assumption that the exchange - correlation potential , @xmath10 , is separable into a valence part and a core part : @xmath11 + v_{xc}(\\rho^v,\\sigma^v ) .",
    "\\label{vxc}\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the electron density , @xmath13 is the spin polarization , and the superscript @xmath14 refers to the contribution from the valence electrons .",
    "if the core electrons are spatially separated from the valence electrons then this separation is rigorously correct .",
    "however in transition metals , the @xmath9-electrons have large wavefunction amplitudes near the core region . therefore , because @xmath10 is a non - linear function of both charge and spin polarization , use of eqn .",
    "[ vxc ] is inaccurate .",
    "early pseudopotential calculations for magnetic materials attempted to circumvent this problem by using a small core radius @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a pseudo - wavefunction which was similar to the all electron wavefunction and therefore could not be expanded efficiently using plane waves .",
    "a better solution is offered by the partial non - linear core correction scheme of louie et al.@xcite , in which the core charge density is explicitly retained in both the construction of the ionic pseudopotential , and in the dft calculation .    the pwpp method with optimized pseudopotentials and partial non - linear core corrections",
    "was first tested by sasaki et al . for ferromagnetic nickel and iron@xcite . the structural and magnetic properties calculated using the pwpp method",
    "were found to be in excellent agreement with results from all electron calculations .",
    "a similar study using different soft pseudopotentials obtained comparable results for the ground - state properties of nickel@xcite .",
    "more recently , lewis and coworkers presented the first pwpp calculation for a magnetic _ compound _",
    "( cro@xmath15)@xcite , and showed that the results agreed well with those of all electron lsda calculations . before presenting our results for bimno@xmath0 in section  [ results ]",
    ", we will compare the results of our pwpp calculations for a magnetic _ perovskite _ with published all - electron calculations@xcite and show that similarly good agreement is obtained .      for la and bi , we constructed optimized scalar - relativistic pseudopotentials , using ( for la ) a @xmath16 reference configuration with core radius ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 a.u . , and ( for bi ) a @xmath19 reference configuration with @xmath20 a.u . in the la reference configuration",
    "the 4@xmath21 orbitals were unoccupied , and for bi the filled 4@xmath21 shell was placed in the core .",
    "the pseudopotentials were optimized using 4 basis functions with a cutoff wavevector , @xmath22 , of @xmath23 a.u .",
    "@xmath22 determines the convergence of the kinetic energy with respect to the plane wave cutoff energy in reciprocal space calculations .",
    "the resulting optimized pseudopotentials are shown in figures  [ la_pp ] and  [ bi_pp ] .",
    "the pseudopotentials were tested for transferability by comparing with all electron calculations for a range of typical atomic and ionic configurations .",
    "the pseudo - eigenvalues and total energies are equivalent to the all electron values to within a few mevs .    for mn and",
    "o we constructed non - relativistic optimized pseudopotentials .",
    "the oxygen pseudopotentials were generated from a @xmath24 reference configuration with core radii of 1.5 a.u . for both @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals .",
    "they were then optimized using 4 and 3 basis functions with @xmath22 of 7.0 and 6.5 a.u . for s and p orbitals",
    "the oxygen pseudopotentials were used in earlier calculations for non - magnetic perovskite oxides@xcite and gave accurate results . for mn ,",
    "a @xmath27 reference configuration was used , with @xmath17 equal to 2.0 , 2.15 and 2.0 a.u . for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "the optimized pseudopotentials for mn were constructed using 4 basis functions and @xmath28 a.u . , and partial non - linear core corrections@xcite were included .",
    "the core charge was approximated by a zeroth order spherical bessel function within a radius of 0.737 a.u .",
    ", with the full core charge used outside this radius .",
    "the resulting optimized pseudopotentials are shown in figures  [ mn_pp ] and  [ ox_pp ] . again",
    "the pseudopotentials are transferable to within a few mevs .",
    "all pseudopotentials were put into separable form@xcite using two projectors for each angular momentum@xcite .",
    "the first projector was taken as the atomic pseudo wavefunction , and the second projector as @xmath29 times the first projector , suitably orthogonalized to the first@xcite . for la , bi and mn ,",
    "the @xmath30 component was chosen as the local potential . for oxygen",
    "the local potential was the @xmath31 component .",
    "the absence of ghost states was confirmed using the ghost theorem of gonze , k \" ackell and scheffler@xcite .",
    "the total energy and band structure calculations were performed on a silicon graphics power challenge l using the conjugate gradient program castep 2.1@xcite which we have extended to study spin - polarized systems .",
    "we used a plane wave cut off of 60 ry , which corresponds to around 3500 plane waves in a cubic unit cell with lattice constant of around 4   . a variable gaussian broadening between 1 ev and 0.002 ev was applied to the k - point sampling to speed convergence for metallic systems .",
    "a 6x6x6 monkhorst - pack@xcite grid was used for all calculations .",
    "this led to 10 k - points in the irreducible brillouin zone for the high symmetry cubic structures , and a correspondingly higher number for the distorted structures with lower symmetry .",
    "the perdew - zunger parameterization@xcite of the ceperley - alder exchange correlation potential@xcite with the von barth - hedin interpolation formula@xcite was used .",
    "previous all - electron calculations for perovskite manganites@xcite found no appreciable difference between results obtained using the von barth - hedin and the more sophisticated vosko - wilk - nusair@xcite interpolations .    for density of states ( dos ) calculations we interpolated the calculated eigenvalues to a grid of @xmath32 350,000 k - points in the irreducible simple cubic brillouin zone using the interpolation scheme of monkhorst and pack @xcite .",
    "we then applied the gilat - raubenheimer method@xcite to this fine mesh .",
    "finally , for the band structure plots , and for use in the tight - binding analysis , symmetry labels along high - symmetry lines were assigned using projection operators for the corresponding irreducible representations .      before presenting our new results for bimno@xmath0 , we first show that the results obtained for perovskite manganites using this pwpp implementation are in excellent agreement with the results of previously published lapw calculations . figure  [ camno3_nlcc ] shows the band structures for up- and down- spin electrons in cubic ferromagnetic camno@xmath0 , calculated in this work using the pwpp method .",
    "we used a 10 electron ca pseudopotential with a @xmath33 ca@xmath6 reference configuration and core radii of 1.29 , 1.29 and 1.45 a.u . for the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath9 potentials .",
    "four basis functions were included in the optimization@xcite , with a cutoff wavevector of 7.0 a.u .",
    "the band structures are indistinguishable from those shown in figure 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were calculated using the lapw method .",
    "in addition , we find that our pwpp calculated energy difference between the ferro- and paramagnetic phases of camno@xmath0 is 876 mev , within 2% of the lapw value of 860 mev .",
    "the inclusion of non - linear core corrections is essential .",
    "the pseudopotential band structure calculated _ without _ non - linear core corrections is markedly different from the lapw band structure . in particular the energy of the minority spin mn @xmath4 bands is too high , a pseudo - gap opens up in the majority spin o @xmath5 bands , and the lower o @xmath5 bands have unphysical flat regions .",
    "in addition the total energy difference between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is overestimated to be 3.2 ev .",
    "in this section we investigate the origin of the differences between bimno@xmath0 and the rare earth manganites by comparing the calculated electronic properties of bimno@xmath0 with those of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "we begin by calculating the electronic structure for the high symmetry cubic phases , without including magnetic effects , then lower the magnetic symmetry to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "finally we introduce structural distortions in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic calculations .",
    "this ability to isolate structural and magnetic distortions is unique to computational studies , and allows identification of the essential microscopic interactions which cause the observed macroscopic behavior .",
    "all calculations are carried out at the experimental lattice constant of 3.95   .",
    "first we present results for bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 in the highest possible symmetry state - that is the cubic structure , without spin polarization ( we call this the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase ) .",
    "although this phase is experimentally inaccessible , it provides a useful reference for understanding the ferromagnetic ( fm ) structures to be discussed later in this paper .",
    "figure  [ pm_dos ] shows the calculated densities of states for cubic paramagnetic lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 .",
    "the plotted energy range is from -12 ev to 4 ev , and the lower lying semi - core states have been omitted for clarity .",
    "the fermi level is set to zero in both cases .",
    "the broad series of bands between -2 and -7 ev in both materials arises from the oxygen @xmath5 orbitals . above the oxygen @xmath5 bands , and separated from them by an energy gap , are the mn @xmath4 bands .",
    "the mn @xmath4 bands are divided into two sub - bands - the lower energy @xmath34 bands , and the higher energy @xmath35 bands - as a result of crystal field splitting by the octahedral oxygen anions .",
    "one striking _ difference _ between the two dos plots is the presence of a band between -10 and -12 ev in the bimno@xmath0 band structure which does not exist in the lamno@xmath0 case .",
    "this band corresponds to the high lying occupied bi @xmath7 electrons .",
    "in addition , the high energy la @xmath36 electrons have a very different form than the bi @xmath8 electrons , which occupy a similar energy range .",
    "the fermi level lies near the top of the mn @xmath4 @xmath34 bands and is in a region of high density of states .",
    "the large dos at the fermi level suggests that the cubic pm structure is unstable , and that a lower energy structure could be achieved by allowing spin - polarization and/or structural distortion .",
    "figure  [ pm_bs ] shows the corresponding band structures along the high symmetry axes of the simple cubic brillouin zone .",
    "again the broad o @xmath5 bands between -2 and -7 ev can be seen clearly in both materials , with the mn @xmath4 bands above them , separated by an energy gap .",
    "the highlighted lines in the band structure plots accentuate the upper and lower mn @xmath4 bands , which have a similar form to each other and to those of camno@xmath0 ( figure  [ camno3_nlcc ] ) .",
    "this indicates a ` universality ' in the manganite structure throughout the perovskite manganite series , which is independent of the identity of the large cation .",
    "again we observe the bi @xmath7 band , which can be seen to have considerable dispersion suggesting that it is involved in covalent bonding .",
    "in addition , the mn @xmath4 bands in bimno@xmath0 overlap with the partially occupied bi @xmath8 orbitals , whereas in lamno@xmath0 the next highest bands are the unoccupied la 5@xmath9 bands .",
    "the differences between the two band structures show up clearly in the bands along the @xmath37 line .",
    "this region of the band structure is shown in figure  [ gtox_pm ] with the symmetry labels added , and the energy scale extended to include the lower energy o @xmath38 and la 5p bands . in the following discussion we focus on the bands with @xmath39 symmetry as capturing the essential features .",
    "the @xmath39 bands are plotted with solid lines , and all other bands with dashed lines .    in lamno@xmath0 ,",
    "the oxygen @xmath5 @xmath40 bands decrease monotonically in energy from @xmath41 to x , and the mn @xmath4 @xmath40 band increases monotonically from @xmath41 to x. figure  [ laggnu ] shows a contour plot of the charge density in the group of bands above the o @xmath5 manifold near the fermi level at the @xmath41 point .",
    "the spacing of the outer three lines is @xmath42 that of the innermost contours .",
    "the charge density has been projected on the ( 100 ) plane by integrating through the whole unit cell perpendicular to ( 100 ) .",
    "the mn ion is located at the center of the plot , the la ions at the corners and the o ions in the middle of the cell edges and at the center .",
    "it is clear that the fermi surface consists largely of mn @xmath4 electrons , with contributions from other atoms below the resolution of the plot .",
    "the charge density at the x point is very similar , except that there is a small oxygen contribution , indicating that the amount of mn @xmath4 - o @xmath5 hybridization increases along the @xmath41 to x line .    in bimno@xmath0",
    "the behavior is quite different .",
    "first , the @xmath43 symmetry of the bi @xmath7 band at the x - point causes the @xmath43 o @xmath5 band to be ` pushed up ' in energy , resulting in a different ordering of the o @xmath5 bands at the x point .",
    "the mn @xmath4 @xmath40 band crosses the very dispersive bi @xmath8 @xmath40 band , and the latter moves below the fermi level near the x point .",
    "figures  [ biggnu ] and  [ bixgnu ] show contour plots at the @xmath41 and x points respectively , of the charge density in the five bands near the fermi level above the o @xmath5 manifold .",
    "( these are the bands which we found to be entirely mn @xmath4 in the case of lamno@xmath0 . )",
    "again the charge density is projected onto the ( 100 ) plane , and the same scale is used for the contours as in fig  [ laggnu ] . at the @xmath41",
    "point the charge distribution is similar to that of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "however at x there is a significant amount of charge density around the bi atoms .",
    "further analysis reveals that the bi component is in the @xmath44 band , which crossed the highest mn @xmath4 band .",
    "the lack of anti - crossing between the bi @xmath8 and mn @xmath4 @xmath40 bands is due to the zero matrix element between the bi @xmath8 and mn @xmath4 orbitals .    to quantify the differences between cubic pm bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 , we performed tight - binding analyses of the @xmath41 to x regions of the respective band structures .",
    "tight - binding parameters were obtained by non - linear - least - squares fitting@xcite to the calculated _ ab initio _ energies at the high symmetry @xmath41 and x points , and at 19 points along the @xmath45 axis .",
    "first we performed analyses with only oxygen @xmath38 and @xmath5 and mn @xmath4 orbitals included in the basis set .",
    "the tight - binding parameters thus obtained are given in table  [ tb_params1 ] .",
    "the band energies calculated using these parameters have root mean square ( rms ) deviations from the _ ab initio _ energies of 0.20 for lamno@xmath0 and 0.25 for bimno@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting band structures for the bands of @xmath40 symmetry are compared with the _ ab initio _ values in figure  [ tbfit_1 ] .",
    "the limited basis set reproduces the lamno@xmath0 bands well , consistent with an early proposal by goodenough@xcite that the magnetic properties of lamno@xmath0 are determined by the mn @xmath4 - o @xmath5 hybridization only .",
    "note that the fit to the lower energy o @xmath38 bands is the least good - these bands are very close in energy to the la @xmath46 bands which have not been included in the fit .",
    "the behavior of the bimno@xmath0 @xmath40 bands is less well reproduced , confirming that additional orbital overlaps are essential in producing the observed band structure .",
    "we then repeated the fitting procedure for bimno@xmath0 , with bi @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals added to the basis .",
    "transfer integrals between nearest neighbor bi @xmath7 - o @xmath5 , bi @xmath8 - o @xmath5 , bi @xmath8 - mn @xmath4 and bi @xmath8 - bi @xmath8 orbitals were allowed to be non - zero .",
    "this significantly improved the quality of the fit to the _ ab initio _ bands ( see figure  [ tbfit_2 ] ) , and reduced the root mean square deviation to 0.12 .",
    "the values of the new tight - binding parameters are given in table  [ tb_params2 ] .",
    "the largest transfer integrals involving bi are the bi @xmath7 - o @xmath5 and bi @xmath8 - o @xmath5 @xmath13 interactions , with the magnitude of the @xmath13-bonded bi @xmath8 - o @xmath5 interaction being approximately 30 % larger than that of the bi @xmath7 - o @xmath5 . also large are the bi @xmath8 - bi @xmath8 @xmath13 interactions , which cause the bi @xmath8 @xmath40 band to be pushed down below the fermi level .",
    "the conclusion from our tight - binding analysis is consistent with recent measurements showing enhancement of charge ordering in bi - doped camno@xmath0@xcite .",
    "rao and co - workers observed that the charge - ordered state in bi@xmath47ca@xmath48mno@xmath0 persists to a higher temperature than that in la@xmath47ca@xmath48mno@xmath0 .",
    "they explained their observations by noting that the electronegativity of bi enhances bi - o hybridization and in turn reduces the amount of mn - o hybridization .",
    "additional evidence in support of this phenomenon can be extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a temperature - composition phase diagram for bi@xmath49ca@xmath50mno@xmath0 , showing the charge - ordered transition and the nel temperature , is plotted .",
    "comparison with similar data for la@xmath49ca@xmath50mno@xmath0 ( in for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) confirms that the charge ordered phase persists to higher temperature in bi - doped camno@xmath0 than in la - doped camno@xmath0 .",
    "the ability to tune the positions of phase boundaries by substitution of bi for the rare earth ions might prove valuable in optimizing materials properties for specific device applications .",
    "next , we present the results of calculations in which the high symmetry cubic structure is retained , but the electrons are allowed to spin polarize .",
    "we find that introduction of spin polarization reduces the energy of both bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 by around 1 ev per unit cell compared with the paramagnetic case .",
    "the most important observation of this section is that the _ differences _ between bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 which we observed in the paramagnetic calculations persist into the ferromagnetic phase , the pm to fm transition introducing the same kinds of changes in both materials .",
    "figure  [ fm_dos ] shows the calculated densities of states for cubic ferromagnetic lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 .",
    "the majority spins are represented by the solid line on the positive y - axis , and the minority spins by the dashed line on the negative y - axis . in both lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 ,",
    "the down - spin mn @xmath4 band is split off from the o @xmath5 band , and has a similar form to the corresponding paramagnetic band .",
    "the up - spin mn @xmath4 hybridizes strongly with the o @xmath5 and there is no band gap for the majority carriers .",
    "the up - spin dos at the fermi level in lamno@xmath0 is still high , indicating that the cubic fm state has a high energy .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the lowest energy spin polarization in _ structurally relaxed _",
    "lamno@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic@xcite .",
    "the dos at the fermi level in bimno@xmath0 is somewhat lower suggesting that the fm phase should be more stable in bimno@xmath0 than in lamno@xmath0 . for both compounds , the fermi level cuts through the very bottom of the down - spin mn @xmath4 bands , and the conduction band",
    "is occupied almost entirely by up - spin electrons .",
    "materials in which the electrons at the fermi level are 100% spin - polarized are known as half - metallics , and are considered desirable for use in devices such as spin - transistors .",
    "again the most obvious differences between the two electronic structures are the presence of the bi 6@xmath25 band between -10 and -12 ev , and the contrasting forms of the bi @xmath8 and la @xmath36 bands .",
    "figure  [ fm_bs ] shows the up and down - spin band structures for bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 along the high symmetry axes of the simple cubic brillouin zone .",
    "there are many similarities between the fm and pm energy bands , and our earlier conclusions regarding the origins of the differences between bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 continue to be valid .    first we examine the up- and down - spin lamno@xmath0 band structures , and compare with the pm lamno@xmath0 band structures to determine the changes which spin polarization causes in a ` conventional ' manganite . the states which correspond to non - magnetic atoms are unchanged from the paramagnetic state , and are identical for up- and down - spin electrons .",
    "for example , the dispersion of the lowest o @xmath5 band is identical for up- and down - spin , and for the pm phase .",
    "also the la @xmath36 bands , which were above the mn @xmath4 bands in the pm state are unchanged in form and energy . the characteristic perovskite manganite mn @xmath4 pattern which we remarked on earlier persists in the fm phase , appearing around 2 ev higher for the down - spin electrons than for the up - spin because of the exchange splitting .",
    "the up - spin mn @xmath4 and o @xmath5 bands are strongly hybridized and there is no gap between them .",
    "however , the down - spin mn @xmath4 are split off from the o @xmath5 bands by a larger gap than in the pm case . as a result",
    ", the mn @xmath4 bands occupy the same energy region as the unoccupied la @xmath36 bands .",
    "next we compare the up- and down - spin bimno@xmath0 band structures .",
    "as expected , the non - magnetic bi @xmath7 band and the lower o @xmath5 bands are identical for up- and down- spin .",
    "in fact the overall form of the _ down - spin _",
    "o @xmath5 bands is almost identical to that of the corresponding pm bimno@xmath0 bands .",
    "however it is different from that of the down spin lamno@xmath0 o @xmath5 bands - in particular the structure at the @xmath41 point is quite different , a consequence of the unusual behavior of the @xmath40 band which we observed earlier in the pm bands . both up- and",
    "down - spin mn @xmath4 bands show the characteristic perovskite manganite features ( most noticeable in this case along the m - r - x directions ) which we noted earlier in our discussions of the pm band structures , and of camno@xmath0 .",
    "the form of the down - spin mn @xmath4/bi @xmath8 bands is similar to that of the pm phase , although the energy separation from the o @xmath5 bands is larger .",
    "in contrast , the majority bands show strong hybridization between the mn @xmath4 and o @xmath5 electrons .",
    "the lowest mn @xmath4 bands at the @xmath41 point ( @xmath51 ) move below the upper o @xmath5 bands . at the r point ,",
    "the bi @xmath8 bands are now above the mn @xmath4 bands , whereas in the down - spin and paramagnetic band structures they were below .",
    "the contrast between the bimno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 minority conduction electrons is striking .",
    "figure  [ fmlagnu ] is a contour plot of the small amount of down spin charge density in the region above , and separated by a gap from , the o @xmath5 bands .",
    "the charge density through the entire unit cell has been projected onto the ( 100 ) plane .",
    "the electrons are localized entirely in the mn @xmath4 orbitals with no hybridization with the o atoms .",
    "this is a result of the large energy separation between the mn and o bands , which in turn is a consequence of the minority mn @xmath4 bands being pushed to higher energy by exchange forces .",
    "there is no contribution from the la atoms , because the la @xmath36 electrons never intersect the fermi level .",
    "figure  [ fmbignu ] shows the charge density of the down - spin conduction band electrons in bimno@xmath0 . rather than summing over the unit cell ,",
    "two different slices through the unit cell are shown .",
    "the upper plot is in the mn - o ( 100 ) plane , with the mn ion at the center and o ions at the edge mid - points .",
    "there is minority spin conduction band charge density localized on both the mn and o ions .",
    "the lower plot is in the bi - o ( 100 ) plane , with bi ions at the corners and an o ion at the center .",
    "we see that the bi contribution to the charge density is both large and highly directional .",
    "the fact that the conduction electrons partly occupy @xmath26-type atomic orbitals should produce quite different transport characteristics than those observed in conventional rare earth manganites , where the conduction bands are entirely mn @xmath4-type .",
    "finally we investigate the origin of the proposed ferroelectricity in bimno@xmath0 . in keeping with the philosophy of this paper , we study the lattice distortions of the high symmetry cubic phases , and compare our results for bimno@xmath0 with those for lamno@xmath0 .",
    "we restrict our discussion to zone center phonons .",
    "the perovskite manganites have five atoms per unit cell , which results in 15 phonon branches , 3 acoustical and 12 optical . at the @xmath41 point",
    "all phonons are three - fold degenerate , so there is one acoustical phonon frequency ( which is zero ) , and four optical frequencies .",
    "we are interested in the optical phonons which have negative eigenvalues , indicating lattice instabilities .",
    "the force constant matrices for lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 were determined by calculating the hellmann - feynman forces resulting from the displacement of each atom in turn 0.1   along the z direction of the unit cell .",
    "the forces exerted on the mn ions by the other ions were determined using the acoustic sum rule .",
    "we calculated the mn - mn force by applying the acoustic sum rule to both the columns and the rows of the resulting matrix .",
    "the two values differed by less than around 0.001 @xmath52 .",
    "our calculated force constant matrices for paramagnetic lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 are tabulated in table  [ fcmatrices ] .",
    "the paramagnetic cubic phases of both lamno@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 have two unstable phonon modes .",
    "the frequencies and eigenvectors of the unstable modes are given in table  [ phonons ] .",
    "the mode involving motion of the equatorial oxygens , shown in figure  [ phonon ] ( b ) , does not correspond to a ferroelectric distortion and will not be discussed further .",
    "the displacement pattern for the second unstable mode is shown in figure  [ phonon ] ( a ) . here",
    "the large ( bi or la ) cations are moving in opposition to the oxygen cage , resulting in a ferroelectric displacement .",
    "the imaginary frequency of this mode is twice as large in bimno@xmath0 than in lamno@xmath0 , indicating a stronger instability in the bi compound .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mn is moving in the same direction as the oxygen ions .",
    "this is opposite to the behavior of the ti ion in batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 , but similar to the behavior of zr in pbzro@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the imaginary frequency phonons in the ferromagnetic phases are less unstable than the corresponding imaginary frequency paramagnetic phonons .",
    "in fact the ferroelectric mode in lamno@xmath0 is now only slightly unstable , at @xmath53 @xmath54 , and the other formerly unstable mode now has a positive frequency .",
    "however the frequency of the ferroelectric mode in ferromagnetic bimno@xmath0 remains strongly unstable , at @xmath55 @xmath54 .",
    "it is clear from our analysis , that the presence of ferroelectricity in bimno@xmath0 , and absence of ferroelectricity in lamno@xmath0 , can be explained by the different zone center lattice instabilities .",
    "although a definitive prediction requires calculation of the phonon dispersion throughout the entire brillouin zone , it is likely that the weakly unstable zone center phonon in lamno@xmath0 will be overshadowed by a stronger instability elsewhere in the brillouin zone , reproducing theoretically the experimentally observed jahn - teller distortion .",
    "similarly , the very unstable ferroelectric mode at the zone center in bimno@xmath0 is likely to dominate over possible unstable modes at other frequencies , confirming theoretically the suggested existence of ferroelectricity in bimno@xmath0 .",
    "we are in the process of developing spin - polarized density functional perturbation theory code@xcite which will allow us to investigate efficiently the nature of the phonons throughout the entire brillouin zone .",
    "our results will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "an alternative suggestion for the origin of the ferroelectricity in bimno@xmath0 is that it originates from an electronic phase transition , in contrast to the conventional displacive ferroelectricity caused by a lattice distortion@xcite .",
    "electronic ferroelectricity _ has been demonstrated theoretically@xcite in the insulating phase of the falicov - kimball model , and there is some experimental data which is consistent with the occurrence of electronic ferroelectricity@xcite .",
    "the correlations associated with the electronic instability are included via a bcs - like wavefunction and thus the resulting energy is not expected to be well described within the local density approximation . in similar situations , however , lda results have been successfully used to compute values of model parameters for input to many - body investigations@xcite .",
    "this is clearly a subject which merits further experimental and theoretical study .",
    "our results indicate that covalent bonding between the bismuth cations and oxygen anions in bimno@xmath0 introduces additional orbital interactions compared with the rare earth manganites , in which the rare earth - oxygen interaction is essentially purely ionic .",
    "these additional orbital interactions in turn stabilize different magnetic and structural phases .",
    "our results are consistent with the limited experimental data on doped bimno@xmath0-based compounds , and suggest that a modern experimental study of pure bimno@xmath0 might reveal novel and potentially useful phenomena .",
