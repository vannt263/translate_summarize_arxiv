    "hadrons and nuclei colliding at very large energies can be used to study a novel regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) called the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by a saturation of the transverse densities of gluons @xmath2 in the initial wave functions , setting an energy scale @xmath3 , the saturation scale .",
    "high occupation numbers permit a quasi - classical description of the gluon fields in the nuclei before collisions @xcite , and at very early time after the collision @xcite .",
    "data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have given us hints that we have reached an energy regime where cgc could be the correct description of the relevant degrees of freedom of early stages of nuclear collisions .",
    "there is a large body of evidence that a thermalized quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is eventually created within the first fm/@xmath4 after the collision of nuclei at rhic or lhc energies @xcite .",
    "cgc as an effective theory can be used to describe the very first step in this process , from the original nuclear wave functions to a space - time volume filled with coherent and far off - equilibrium gluon fields , called a glasma , at a time @xmath5 fm/@xmath4 after the collision .",
    "the dominant feature of the fields immediately after the collision are flux tubes of longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "after this initial period the fields have to decohere and the emerging particles have to approach equlibrium @xcite . after equilibrium is reached at a time @xmath6 hydrodynamics can be used to describe the global collective motion of the system @xcite .",
    "the success of hydrodynamics in heavy ion collisions is based on its ability to capture key features of the collective flow of the thermalized qgp , foremost the radial transverse flow @xmath7 and the quadrupole asymmetry @xmath8 , called elliptic flow .    however , flow is not a privilege of thermalized matter with pressure gradients .",
    "in fact the effective `` transverse pressure '' @xmath9 in a purely longitudinal classical gauge field is equal to the energy density @xmath10 , and thus gradients in pressure would be larger by a factor 3 than in a relativistic free gas with the same energy density @xcite .",
    "thus the amount of initial collective motion , often termed pre - equilibrium flow , at the starting time @xmath11 of the hydrodynamic evolution is not expected to be small .",
    "in fact various efforts have been made to estimate the magnitude of transverse flow around midrapidity from color glass or other dynamics @xcite , although many hydrodynamics simulations still neglect pre - equilibrium flow .    in this letter",
    "we expand existing calculations by analyzing the full 3 + 1-dimensional structure of the initial gluon energy flow . to that end",
    "we will present an analytic calculation of the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 immediately after the collision of nuclei in a strictly classical implementation of cgc , the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite .",
    "we then compute the energy momentum tensor @xmath14 of the gluon field as a function of space - time coordinates for small proper times @xmath15 after the collision .",
    "we analyze the resulting global map of energy and momentum flow , in particular the transverse poynting vector @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "we will argue that it can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 is even in the space - time rapidity @xmath20 $ ] and driven by the gradient of the initial transverse pressure @xmath21 of the gluon field ; in short this term behaves `` hydro - like '' and has in fact been discussed before analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "the novel @xmath22-odd term @xmath19 arises from asymmetries between the two nuclei , e.g.  for collisions @xmath0 of different nuclei or for symmetric @xmath23 collision with finite impact parameter @xmath24 .",
    "since it vanishes at mid - rapidity it has not been discussed in situations where one expects flow to be ( almost ) boost - invariant .",
    "one can show that despite the superficial appearance the @xmath22-odd flow term @xmath19 does not break the boost - invariance which is intrinsic to the mv model .",
    "we will argue , using the abelian case , that both rapidity - odd and -even terms are a natural consequence of faraday s law and gauss law .",
    "we will conclude this letter by discussing the phenomenological consequences for several colliding systems and impact parameters .",
    "in the cgc the large momentum components of the nuclear wave function are assumed to be strongly lorentz - contracted in the lab frame and can be approximated by an infinitely thin sheet .",
    "the large momentum quarks and gluons form an effective color @xmath25 charge density @xmath26 , @xmath27 , on that sheet , where @xmath28 is a transverse position .",
    "they act as sources for the soft gluon modes which are described by the classical field @xmath29 . in the mclerran - venugopalan model",
    "the source @xmath30 moving along the @xmath31-light cone leads to a @xmath25-current @xmath32 in light cone gauge .",
    "the soft gluon modes are determined by the yang - mills equation @xmath33 .",
    "the charge density @xmath26 varies on time scales that are large compared to typical time scales of the collision .",
    "it vanishes on average , @xmath34 , due to local color neutrality , but has a non - vanishing variance @xmath35 which in the mv model is realized by a gaussian distribution with @xmath36 thus @xmath35 is the average , _ color - summed _ , squared density of charges in the transverse plane ( which differs from the definition in @xcite by a factor @xmath37 ) .",
    "the most fundamental result of the mv model is an expression for the gluon distribution function of a nucleus in light cone gauge ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 where the uv limit ( both fields evaluated at the same transverse position @xmath28 ) has been taken . here",
    "@xmath40 is a uv cutoff related to the resolution with which the gluon distribution is probed and @xmath41 is an infrared scale that can be introduced as an effective gluon mass .",
    "this result was first calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for infinitely large , homogeneous nuclei , i.e.  for constant source area density @xmath35 .",
    "of course this is not a realistic approximation for nuclei .",
    "we have checked that if variations of @xmath42 are permitted but are small on the ir length scale @xmath43 , i.e.@xmath44 many well - known results of the mv model , in particular eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluondist ] ) hold and corrections can be classified in an expansion in gradients @xmath45 . in simple terms",
    "this indicates that the physics of color glass and the less known qcd dynamics at larger distances can be separated in a meaningful way as long as condition ( [ eq : conditionv ] ) is satisfied . we will report details of this calculation elsewhere @xcite .",
    "given the purely transverse gauge fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the nuclei before the collision , in their respective light cone gauge , one can write the longitudinal chromo - electric and -magnetic fields after the collision for small times @xmath48 as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the square of the covariant derivative with respect to gauge field @xmath51 and @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] are the longitudinal fields at @xmath54 .",
    "since the transverse fields vanish at @xmath54 this has given rise to the notion of flux tubes of longitudinal electric and magnetic fields @xcite . in terms of those initial longitudinal fields the transverse fields",
    "can be expressed as @xcite @xmath55 plus terms of order @xmath56 and higher .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the initial energy density @xmath57 and the initial transverse energy flux given by the poynting vector @xmath58 . the leading behavior at small @xmath48 has four terms , two even in @xmath22 , @xmath59 and two odd in @xmath22 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the longitudinal energy flow is suppressed and starts at order @xmath62 , @xmath63 \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that the mv model is boost - invariant by definition and the @xmath22-dependence of the energy flow does not violate boost - invariance .",
    "one can verify that the full energy momentum tensor @xmath14 satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the lorenz boost tensor with rapidity @xmath66 along the @xmath67-axis .",
    "in fact the rapidity - odd field is a natural consequence of the field equations as the next section will show .",
    "and @xmath68 test ampre s and faraday s laws with areas @xmath69 in the transverse plane and gauss law with a cube of volume @xmath70 .",
    "the transverse fields from ampre s and faraday s laws ( black solid arrows ) are the same in both cases , while the transverse fields from gauss law ( black dashed arrows ) are observed with opposite signs .",
    "initial longitudinal fields are indicated by solid grey arrows , thickness reflects field strength . ]",
    "let us consider the following equivalent boundary value problem in classical electrodynamics . in the forward light cone @xmath71 we have the maxwell equations",
    "@xmath72 without sources . on the light cone",
    "@xmath54 we demand the boundary conditions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , i.e. the initial fields are purely longitudinal .",
    "we also assume that those fields are related through transverse fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the abelian problem for fixed initial conditions can in principle be solved analytically @xcite , but it will suffice here to give the solution order by order in powers of @xmath48 as we did in the case of qcd . from the qcd solutions we can immediately conclude that the longitudinal fields in the abelian case are @xmath79 while the transverse fields are @xmath80 for small times @xmath48 , i.e.   @xmath81 .",
    "the cartesian coordinates permit simple checks of these solutions with gauss , ampre s and faraday s laws .",
    "there is a straight - forward interpretation of some aspects of these results .",
    "let us choose , just as an example , a transverse position where @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 so that the longitudinal fields decrease away from the light cone @xmath85 .",
    "two observers at fixed points @xmath86 and @xmath68 would observe the same electric ( magnetic ) flux through a small transverse area @xmath69 with an initial value @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) at @xmath89 which then diminishes at the same rate @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) for both .",
    "due to ampre s ( faraday s ) law this reduction induces magnetic ( electric ) fields curling with a negative ( positive ) chirality around the longitudinal fields , respectively , see fig .  [ fig:2 ] .    on the other hand the same two observers at fixed points @xmath92 and @xmath93 can at time @xmath89 count the electric or magnetic flux through small cubes of volume @xmath70 whose sides are aligned with the coordinate axes .",
    "one side is held at @xmath94 , while the opposite side is at @xmath95 for the observer at @xmath92 or @xmath93 respectively . in the former case",
    "the total flux out of the box due to the longitudinal field is @xmath96 while for the observer at @xmath93 the net flux of longitudinal field has the opposite sign .",
    "thus at @xmath92 a net flux of transverse field has to enter into the box while at @xmath93 the same amount has to flow out of the box to satisfy gauss law .",
    "to summarize , the transverse fields naturally have a part due to gauss law with vanishing circulation ( @xmath97 ) , which is odd in @xmath22 , and they have a part due to ampre s and faraday s law ( and with different signs between the magnetic and electric part due to the lenz rule ) with vanishing transverse divergence ( @xmath98 ) , which is even in @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the transverse electric and magnetic fields for two rapidities @xmath22 for random fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 in a sector of the transverse plane .",
    "one can check that this statement about transverse fields translates directly into a matching statement about the transverse flow of energy since the initial transverse poynting vector is linear in the transverse fields , @xmath99 .",
    "thus we have the four contributions already discussed in the case of qcd , two of them odd in @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the flux of energy in the transverse plane for two rapidities for the same random configuration of fields @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "eqs .  ( [ eq:2a ] ) , ( [ eq:2b ] ) can be the basis for a monte carlo modeling of the energy flow starting from a sampling of possible nuclear fields @xmath75 , @xmath76 or initial charge densities @xmath100 , @xmath101 in the colliding nuclei . here",
    "we will present a calculation of the expectation value of the flow fields carried out in the mv model with slowly varying average charge density @xmath35 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the expectation value of the initial energy density is given by the product of the average source densities @xmath102 , @xmath103 in both nuclei , @xmath104    for the transverse poynting vector let us discuss our expectations before calculating the result .",
    "first we note that the non - abelian terms from the covariant derivatives would lead to expectation values of three - gluon correlators @xmath105 in one of the nuclei which under the assumptions of the mclerran - venugopalan model vanish .",
    "furthermore we can convince ourselves that because of the relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 the two terms in ( [ eq:2b ] ) are the same up to a sign and thus add up constructively .",
    "one can also easily argue that for dimensional reasons @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and their contractions with @xmath110 are the only four transverse vectors available after averaging",
    ".    the first option , symmetric in the two nuclei and circulation - free , is picked by the @xmath22-even flow term @xmath111 it mimics hydrodynamic flow . for the @xmath22-odd flow term",
    "we need to know the expectation value of two gluon fields in light cone gauge with one derivative .",
    "following the same recipe that leads to the expression ( [ eq : gluondist ] ) for the gluon distribution and using our smoothness condition on @xmath42 we obtain @xmath112 as the leading term contributing to @xmath113 .",
    "we refer the reader to a detailed calculation of this correlation function in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "it is then straight forward to obtain the rapidity - odd flow as @xmath114",
    "to summarize , the prediction of classical qcd for the initial average transverse energy flow normalized by the average initial energy density is @xmath115 which is independent of the uv cutoff and the ir regulator . in the following we have calculated @xmath116 in several situations using woods - saxon profiles for incident nuclei .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the average flow field @xmath116 for the collision of two gold nuclei at impact parameter @xmath117 fm in the transverse plane for two space - time rapidities .",
    "one can clearly see the evolution in rapidity from a hydro - like flow field at @xmath118 to a preferred flow direction at forward rapidity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the same collision is shown in the @xmath119-plane .",
    "clearly the flow tilts the fireball clockwise .",
    "the orientation of rotation is as if the gluon flux tubes preferred to expand in the wake of spectator nucleons in such a way that the flow increases with increasing separation from the spectators in rapidity .",
    "however this can not be taken literally as the origin of the effect .",
    "our calculation is based on a small time expansion and the response of the energy density to the flow will come in at the next order .",
    "note that the normalizations of the vector fields in the figures are arbitrary .",
    "typical values of the flow @xmath116 at the surface for au+au collisions is @xmath120 at @xmath121 fm/@xmath4 at midrapidity .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows the average flow fields @xmath116 for au+cu collisions at impact parameters @xmath122 fm and @xmath123 fm in the @xmath119-plane . in the central case",
    "the flow field leads to an expansion which is much more pronounced on the cu - side of the system , consistent with the rule of thumb that flux tubes like to expand into the wake of spectators ( which here are solely from the gold nucleus ) .",
    "the flow pattern becomes more involved for au+cu collisions at finite impact parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] the flow in the transverse plane is shown for forward and backward rapidity for the @xmath123 fm au+cu system .",
    "we notice that the azimuthal modulation of the flow is non - trivial but can again be understood through the position of spectator nucleons from the au nucleus ( centered at @xmath124 fm ) .",
    "this and the previous figures make it clear that @xmath19 contributes not only to directed flow but also to the elliptic flow",
    ".    the flow of energy in the classical field before @xmath11 will translate into a flow of energy in the hydrodynamic phase after thermalization due to local energy and momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "one expects remnants of this flow to survive in hydrodynamics due to the inertia of fluid cells .",
    "in particular , this should result in a directed flow of particles which is odd in momentum rapidity @xmath66 .",
    "in fact such a @xmath66-odd directed flow , measured by the first fourier component @xmath1 , has been observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "the sign of the effect is consistent with the expectation from color glass , moreover the data points as a function of rapidity could be fitted with a @xmath125-shaped function . at this point",
    "it is too early to draw strong conclusions but the coincidence of sign and shape of the effect with data is encouraging .",
    "some of the qualitative features of the flow field discussed here have been generated in hydrodynamic simulations by initializing a tilted source @xcite , e.g.  postulated in the fire streak model @xcite .",
    "our calculation suggests that color glass could account for this phenomenon without invoking additional model assumptions . in addition",
    ", classical qcd adds several unique predictions in particular for the case of collisions of asymmetric nuclei .",
    "a systematic study of flow as a function of rapidity and different nuclear systems could find this unique fingerprint of color glass .",
