    "ample evidence now exists for the presence of massive galaxies at @xmath0 with little or no ongoing star formation , suggesting that a non - negligible fraction of the local early - type galaxy population was effectively in place only a few gyr after the big bang , and that massive red galaxies constitute a significant fraction of ( or possibly even dominate ) the stellar mass density at @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . although their masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) are nominally similar , it has since become clear that these quiescent galaxies at @xmath4 have dramatically different structures compared to local ellipticals : specifically , the high - redshift galaxies sizes are much smaller ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their surface densities likewise evolve strongly with redshift , as does the `` threshold '' surface density above which galaxies are predominantly quiescent @xcite .",
    "these phenomena pose several new challenges for studies of galaxy formation . indeed ,",
    "if massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 were almost universally compact and dense , why are similar objects in the local universe practically nonexistent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several mechanisms for this transformation have been proposed , including a scenario whereby local early - type galaxies are built through a series of `` dry '' ( i.e. , gas - poor ) mergers of these compact progenitors @xcite .",
    "such mergers , being largely non - dissipative , would over time tend to `` puff up '' compact galaxies .",
    "some observational estimates of the major dry merger rate since @xmath5 indicate that these are indeed a factor in the buildup of massive galaxies @xcite , but the remnants of such major mergers would also have correspondingly larger masses and so it is unclear whether major dry mergers can entirely solve the size - mass discrepancy ( though they are likely to mitigate it to some degree ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "minor mergers may be a more important process  both from a simple virial argument @xcite and because massive compact `` cores '' at high redshift may accrete material in their outskirts to form the massive ellipticals seen today @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical models have yet to converge on a definitive explanation  some proposed models predict galaxy sizes dramatically different from those observed @xcite , while others match observed sizes at @xmath1 and @xmath6 @xcite but not at @xmath5 @xcite .    whatever the underlying mechanism may be , observations of large samples of galaxies over a broad redshift range are crucial to adequately test current and upcoming models . however , many of the aforementioned galaxy structure studies employ hst - nicmos , which provides accurate size measurements but can typically image only one target at a time and is thus inadequate for observing very large samples .",
    "optical imagers are much larger , but at @xmath3 near - ir data are more robust for size determinations ; these bands fall in the rest - frame optical and therefore better trace the distribution of stellar mass than the rest - frame uv ( observed optical ) .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopy of quiescent galaxies ( both to determine their redshifts and confirm their quiescence ) requires large amounts of observing time due to the absence of strong emission lines ; again , while this can be performed for a few bright galaxies at @xmath3 with current facilities @xcite , it is infeasible for the large samples of fainter objects needed to provide a comprehensive view of the high - redshift galaxy population .",
    "fortunately , although spectroscopy and space - based imaging give the most precise picture of star formation and galactic structure for individual objects , the average properties of large samples can be accurately investigated with less `` expensive '' data .",
    "for example , both @xcite and @xcite successfully based their galaxy size measurements on ground - based imaging and photometric redshifts .",
    "although there are inherently greater uncertainties on the size and mass of any individual object than with nicmos imaging and spectroscopic redshifts , the _ average _ structural parameters of large populations can be accurately determined .",
    "furthermore , even without spectroscopy there are several ways to determine which galaxies are quiescent and which are actively forming stars . one straightforward method is to identify galaxies on the `` red sequence '' ( using , e.g. , the rest - frame @xmath7 color ) , which at low redshift is primarily composed of quiescent galaxies with strong 4000  breaks .",
    "however , star - forming galaxies containing large amounts of dust can have similarly red colors , so `` red and dead '' galaxy samples selected through this color cut are likely to be contaminated with substantial numbers of `` red and dusty '' starbursts with increasing redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with photometric observations in a suitable set of filters ,",
    "the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be used to distinguish between the sharp 4000  break characteristic of old stellar populations and the more gradual reddening caused by dust absorption ; the best - fit sfrs and dust column densities from sed modeling codes can then be used to define quiescent galaxy samples .",
    "empirical selection techniques using multiple rest - frame colors , such as the one employed by @xcite , are also effective at separating dusty from `` dead '' galaxies up to @xmath1 ( and even higher ; i.  labb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) with little dependence on input templates or models .",
    "coupled with the large , deep multiwavelength surveys and improved photometric redshift techniques that have emerged in the past few years , these diagnostics provide an unprecedented view of star formation and its relation to other physical properties in massive galaxy populations .    using the largest such publicly - available data set with sufficient depth , the ukidss ultra - deep survey ( and overlapping imaging from the subaru - xmm deep survey and spitzer wide - area extragalactic survey ) , we analyze the structural evolution of quiescent galaxies up to @xmath1 , specifically the correlations between star formation activity , galaxy size , and stellar mass surface density .",
    "first in  [ sec_data ] we review the data and describe the size and mass measurements employed for this study .",
    "next in  [ sec_ssfr ] we investigate how the specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) is related to galaxy mass , size , and surface density , and in  [ sec_rfsize ] present quantitative constraints on the evolution of these structural properties for both star - forming and quiescent galaxies .",
    "finally , the uniformity of the connections between star formation and structure is discussed in  [ sec_uniformity ] along with some novel ways to interpret these correlations .",
    "ab magnitudes and a concordance cosmology ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are assumed throughout .",
    "the high - redshift galaxy sample analyzed herein is based on an updated version of the @xmath11-selected galaxy catalog described in detail by @xcite ; a brief summary follows .",
    "this catalog comprises near - infrared @xmath12 and @xmath11 data taken from the ukidss ultra - deep survey data release 1 ( uds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with overlapping @xmath13 imaging from the subaru - xmm deep survey ( sxds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath14 m data from the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey @xcite .",
    "using the positions and shapes of bright but unsaturated stars in the different bands , all mosaics were astrometrically matched and convolved to consistent point - spread functions ( psfs ) . using the sextractor software @xcite , `` color '' fluxes were measured in fixed 175 apertures and total @xmath11 fluxes from flexible elliptical @xcite apertures .",
    "in addition to the original @xcite catalog , we incorporate the @xmath15-band mosaic from the ukidss data release 3 ( to be described by s.  j.  warren et al .",
    ", in preparation ) with psf- and astrometric matching and flux measurements performed in the same manner as with the other bands .",
    "photometric redshifts were calculated with the @xmath15 data included using the publicly - available code eazy @xcite .",
    "the new photometric redshifts differed very little from the original ones presented by @xcite , but inclusion of the @xmath15 band should in principle improve both the @xmath16 values and stellar mass estimates at @xmath17 . at the adopted flux limit of @xmath18 ,",
    "this catalog contains nearly @xmath19 galaxies .    because of its depth and @xmath20deg@xmath21 area ,",
    "the uds is well - suited for studies of large galaxy samples at @xmath22 ; at lower redshifts , however , the comoving volume probed by the uds is too small to provide meaningful samples ( and may also be severely affected by cosmic variance ) .",
    "thus , for comparison to the uds we also include the same @xmath23 sdss sample used by @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "this sample was originally defined by @xcite , and @xcite performed minor corrections in the mass - to - light ratios ( accounting for the fact that the galaxy centers , where the spectroscopic fibers are placed , are typically redder than the outskirts ) as well as total flux corrections .",
    "the redshift range of @xmath24 was chosen to avoid selection effects on galaxies with high mass ( at the low-@xmath25 end ) and small angular sizes ( at higher redshift ) .",
    "size measurements were performed in a manner similar to that by @xcite .",
    "we use the galfit software package @xcite to fit @xcite models to all bright ( @xmath18 ) sources detected in the unconvolved ( i.e. , before psf matching , to ensure the highest possible angular resolution ) uds @xmath11 image .",
    "this image had a typical seeing fwhm of 07 .",
    "first a square postage stamp 21 pixels ( 42 ) on a side was made around each galaxy to be fitted .",
    "initial guesses for the effective radius @xmath26 , magnitude , ellipticity , and position angle were taken from the sextractor catalog .",
    "the psf used by galfit to deconvolve the galaxy images is the average psf over the image ( taken as the median of 300 bright , unsaturated stars ; also used in the psf - matching step described in williams et al .",
    "the srsic parameter @xmath27 was allowed to vary between 1 and 4 and the effective radius between 001 ( effectively a point source ) and 15 .",
    "since galaxies in general may exhibit color gradients , it is important to measure sizes at approximately the same rest - frame wavelength when comparing samples at different redshifts .",
    "the procedure described above was thus repeated for the unconvolved @xmath12 and @xmath15 images ( both exhibiting 08 seeing ) , and we define the size of a galaxy as its circularized effective radius ( @xmath28 ) at a rest - frame wavelength of 8000 , interpolated from the size measurements of the two adjacent bands . in other words ,",
    "when rest - frame 8000  falls between two observed bands @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the interpolated size is @xmath31\\ ] ]    in practice the interpolated sizes are quite similar to those computed by , e.g. , simply taking the size measured from the observed band closest to 8000 .",
    "however , the interpolation method smoothes out possible discretization effects due to the choice of the measurement filter , and also in principle helps to mitigate failed size measurements in a given band .",
    "previous studies have shown that reliable galaxy sizes can be measured from ground - based data , provided the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficiently high and the psf across the image is stable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , @xcite use simulations to investigate systematic effects , finding them to be minimal down to @xmath32fwhm(psf ) , though individual measurements exhibit a large degree of scatter .",
    "the effective radius is typically the most robust structural parameter measured ; other variables defining the profile shape ( e.g.  sersi index and axis ratio ) are far more susceptible to systematic uncertainties .",
    "it is nonetheless instructive to investigate whether the specific characteristics of the uds data and our fitting techniques have introduced systematic biases ; we thus performed simulations analogous to @xcite to test our effective radius measurements .",
    "model galaxy profiles over a range of magnitudes @xmath33 , @xmath26 from 0.1 to 1 arcsec , and @xmath34 were created ; these were chosen to span typical galaxy angular sizes at @xmath35 .",
    "blank postage stamps ( containing only noise ) were then cut from random positions in the uds @xmath11-band image , and the model galaxies added to them . the identical fitting procedure used on the real images",
    "was then applied to 15000 such simulated postage stamps to derive the output effective radii .",
    "figure  [ fig_sims ] shows the distribution of input and output effective radii , and the fractional difference between the two , as a function of input effective radius .",
    "brighter galaxies are plotted as larger points .",
    "as expected , relatively faint galaxies exhibit larger random uncertainties in their size measurements . while systematic deviations are seen for both the faintest and largest galaxies , these are relatively small ( with a median of @xmath36% ) compared to the random errors ; additionally , since we only include galaxies with @xmath37 in our analysis , objects with such large angular sizes are quite rare .",
    "these observed offsets are comparable to the offsets reported by @xcite ; most importantly , the average effective radii of galaxies with sizes @xmath38 appear to be reasonably reliably recovered . given the large scatter , however , it should be noted that individual measurements of galaxy sizes are highly uncertain even if ensemble averages are accurate .",
    "the simulations described above provide a realistic view of some of the random and systematic uncertainties in this analysis .",
    "however , to some extent these are idealized ; for example , the evident ability to measure effective radii as small as one - half of a pixel may be true in a numerical sense , but in real images additional effects such as psf variations will limit the precision that can be achieved .",
    "we therefore supplement the simulations with a set of purely empirical tests to better assess the reliability of the galaxy size measurements . specifically , we check the following three important assumptions : ( 1 ) the simple interpolation of galaxy sizes between different bands is robust ; ( 2 ) a single psf is sufficient to model the entire image ; and ( 3 ) the fitting box size of 42 is large enough to obtain reasonable fits .    first , to test the interpolation assumption , we estimated the @xmath15-band sizes by averaging the measured @xmath12 and @xmath11 sizes ; the estimated and measured @xmath15 sizes matched very well with no noticeable systematic offset .",
    "the `` single psf '' assumption ( 2 ) was tested by generating four different psfs , each composed of bright stars from the four quadrants of the @xmath11 mosaic , and re - measuring the sizes of galaxies within the central @xmath39 of the @xmath11 mosaic .",
    "while there were small systematic differences in the sizes measured with the different psfs , these were on the order of 002 , which is effectively negligible compared to typical measured galaxy sizes of 02 - 10 .",
    "similarly , the median galaxy sizes show no evidence of systematic deviations with position in the image , indicating that the psf does not significantly vary .",
    "finally , the box - size assumption ( 3 ) was tested by re - fitting a subset of galaxies using postage stamp sizes of 52 and 62 ; the new sizes were fully consistent with those measured in the original 42 cutouts . the exception to this is the largest objects in this sample with @xmath40 ( about 10kpc radius at @xmath35 ) ; these objects exhibit  30%  larger sizes when a larger fitting box is used , but such objects comprise only a tiny fraction ( @xmath41% ) of our @xmath37 sample and so do not affect our results .",
    "re - fitting the same subset of galaxies using different psfs and box sizes also gives an estimate of the measurement uncertainties ( i.e. , the degree to which a given size measurement is reproducible given different assumed input parameters ) .",
    "between 02 and 10 the measured sizes were consistent with each other within @xmath42% ; at 01 the fractional error rapidly increases to about 10%@xmath43% , and at smaller effective radii sizes can no longer be reliably inferred . to determine the efficiency to",
    "which galfit can distinguish between point sources and extended objects in these data , we also measured the radii of stars ( found via color selection ) using the same fitting parameters .",
    "interestingly , while essentially all of the stars have best - fit radii of zero ( as is expected for point sources ) , galfit measures non - zero radii for the vast majority of compact galaxies  even those with best - fit radii much smaller than the psf .",
    "thus , these simulations and empirical tests confirm that effective radius measurements are likely free of major systematic effects down to @xmath44 . even if some offsets are present ( as seen in our simulations and by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are comparable to or smaller than the systematic uncertainties on other parameters ( e.g. , in mass , redshift , and sfr determinations ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that measurements of the average sizes of large galaxy samples down to small radii are robust given these data .",
    "this is similar to what @xcite found by fitting their ground - based data and comparing it to advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging .",
    "the stellar masses of galaxies in this sample were calculated with the _ fitting and assessment of synthetic templates _ ( fast ) code @xcite .",
    "this code uses @xmath45 minimization to fit @xcite stellar population evolution models to the observed broadband photometry .",
    "a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and solar metallicity were assumed ; masses were then shifted by a factor of @xmath46dex for consistency with the @xmath47 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) masses ( which were computed with a @xcite imf ) .",
    "we re - fitted a subset with @xcite models and both imfs to verify that this factor is essentially constant and does not vary systematically with galaxy color or mass .",
    "redshifts were fixed to the @xmath16 values derived by eazy , and a variety of evolutionary histories were allowed in the fitting , including exponentially - declining ( sfr@xmath48 ) models with @xmath49 ranging from @xmath50gyr .",
    "the computed masses are consistent with those calculated using other standard methods , for example using hyperz as a fitting engine and scaling the model amplitudes to estimate masses ( as done by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that @xcite models result in galaxy masses approximately @xmath51dex _ lower _ than @xcite models ; however , unlike the imf correction factor , this discrepancy varies somewhat with galaxy mass .",
    "other parameters , such as the degree of dust extinction @xmath52 , average stellar population ages , exponential factor @xmath49 , and sfr are also computed by fast during the sed fitting procedure .",
    "most of these are highly uncertain when based on broadband data @xcite ; however , the _ ssfr _ ( ssfr@xmath53sfr@xmath54 ) is somewhat more robust .",
    "this quantity , taking the mass of the host galaxy into account , provides a more meaningful characterization of star - formation activity ( e.g. , an sfr of 10@xmath55/year is far more significant in a dwarf galaxy than a giant elliptical ) .",
    "furthermore , since the total sfr and mass both exhibit a similar dependence on the assumed imf , the ssfr is less sensitive to the choice of imf and input stellar population model(s ) than the absolute sfr .",
    "rest - frame colors , particularly the combination of @xmath7 and @xmath56 , are invaluable for distinguishing quiescent galaxies from those actively forming stars @xcite .",
    "although such colors can be derived directly from the templates used for photometric redshift fitting , by definition these colors are confined to the range of colors spanned by the template set ( which may be narrower than the intrinsic range of the galaxy population ) .",
    "instead , we interpolate rest - frame @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath12 fluxes directly from the observed photometry and photometric redshifts using the same method as @xcite but with the new @xmath15-band data included .",
    "this is accomplished using the interrest utility @xcite , which in turn is an implementation of the method described by @xcite .",
    "the reddest observed band in our data set is irac @xmath59 m , corresponding to rest - frame @xmath12 at @xmath60 ; reasonably robust fluxes can thus be interpolated up to approximately this redshift",
    ".      in general , the mass completeness limit of a flux - limited galaxy sample depends strongly on color : since red galaxies have higher mass - to - light ratios , mass - limited red galaxy samples become incomplete at brighter magnitudes than for blue galaxies .",
    "completeness limits derived for strongly heterogeneous ( mixed red and blue ) samples are therefore dominated by blue galaxies , and such samples can still exhibit serious incompleteness effects among massive red galaxies . computing mass limits from red galaxies alone",
    "therefore provides a more conservative estimate of the overall sample completeness .",
    "we derive mass completeness limits for the uds sample by comparing the masses of red galaxies ( @xmath61 ) to their observed @xmath11 magnitudes .",
    "the 75% completeness limit is then defined as the mass at which about 25% of the galaxies in the sample fall below the adopted @xmath11 flux limit .",
    "this is performed for the @xmath62 redshift bin , thus ensuring that our analysis does not suffer from significant incompleteness effects up to @xmath1 . to ensure accurate size measurements ,",
    "the size and surface density analysis is restricted to galaxies with @xmath63 ( approximately 1 magnitude brighter than the formal @xmath64 survey limit , also used in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to a mass limit of @xmath65 .",
    "our newly constructed sample allows us to study the mass - size relation and its evolution to @xmath1 .",
    "this relation , in three redshift bins from the uds , is plotted in figure  [ fig_smassbw ] . to supplement the higher - redshift data , the same relation from sdss at @xmath47",
    "is also shown .",
    "two notable trends stand out : first , there is a correlation between radius and mass , whereby the most massive galaxies out to @xmath66 have on average larger sizes than less massive galaxies ; this effect is weaker or nonexistent at @xmath67 .",
    "a second and related point is that there are effectively no massive , compact galaxies ( @xmath68m@xmath69 , @xmath70kpc ; in the lower right - hand region of the size - mass plot ) at @xmath6 , but at higher redshifts this area of parameter space becomes progressively more populated .",
    "this simply reflects the strong size evolution of massive galaxies found in several previous studies and introduced in  1 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the broad range in galaxy effective radii , at a given mass , is tightly correlated with ssfr out to @xmath71 .",
    "these authors concluded that ssfr is a tight function of stellar mass surface density ( @xmath72 ) , or velocity dispersion ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "put differently , these results imply that the size - mass relation is different for galaxies with different ssfrs .",
    "our sample is ideally suited to study this aspect at higher redshifts , as it covers an area @xmath74 times larger than that used by @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig_smass ] how the ssfr depends on mass and size .",
    "it is clear that the dependence is very strong : at a given mass , galaxies with low ssfrs ( binned and plotted as red / yellow squares in this figure ) have small sizes , while those with large sizes have high ssfrs ( green / blue squares ) .",
    "the effect is not only strong at very low redshift , but extends to the highest redshift bins . at the same time , the sizes of galaxies with low ssfrs ( red in the figure ) are very small at high redshift , consistent with results obtained by others on smaller samples @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab_smass ] lists the best - fit slopes and normalizations of the _ quiescent galaxy _ size - mass relations seen in figure  [ fig_smass ] . for this we defined `` quiescent '' as galaxies exhibiting ssfr@xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the age of the universe at each galaxy s redshift , effectively picking out the red and yellow points in figure  [ fig_smass ]",
    "( see also ",
    "[ sec_rfsize ] and the appendix ) . in each redshift interval",
    "the median log effective radius was calculated in mass bins of width 0.2dex , only including galaxies above the mass completeness limit at each redshift , and a least - squares fit was performed to these median points . for convenience ,",
    "the normalizations of the power - law fits in table  [ tab_smass ] are defined as the log effective radius of a typical galaxy with @xmath77 .",
    "uncertainties were computed using bootstrap resampling .",
    "note that any comparisons between the mass - size relations seen in sdss and uds should be treated with caution , as systematic differences in the size and mass determinations between these two samples may exist .",
    "nonetheless , strong evolution in the normalization of the size - mass relation is evident ; the slope of the relation , however , does not significantly change between @xmath78 .",
    "as the strong mass - size correlation of quiescent galaxies implies , ssfr does not depend strictly on size or mass alone , but rather on some combination of the two .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig_smass ] instead show how ssfrs depend on stellar mass surface density ( @xmath79 ) and mass .",
    "galaxies with the highest surface densities have weak star formation , with very little dependence on mass .",
    "in addition , we can define a `` threshold surface density '' between quiescent and star - forming galaxies ( similar to that defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at each redshift ; in figure  [ fig_smass ] , the sharp color division ( between green and yellow ) at logssfr@xmath80 could be taken as a simple example of one such threshold .",
    "this clearly increases with increasing redshift .",
    "note that this particular threshold depends only weakly on mass ( i.e. is nearly horizontal in the @xmath81-mass plot ) , confirming that surface density is more fundamentally related to star formation activity in galaxies than mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this figure clearly shows at which epoch galaxies of a given size , mass , and density were forming stars : for example , galaxies with @xmath82m@xmath69 were generally star - forming at @xmath3 but by @xmath83 most of their star formation activity had ceased .",
    "however , the most compact massive galaxies ( the lower right - hand region of the radius - mass plot ) are quiescent at all redshifts considered here , and must have been quenched at @xmath0 .",
    "most intriguingly , the compact quiescent galaxies visible at high redshift do not maintain their small sizes or high surface densities to lower redshifts ; instead , the quiescent galaxies progressively evolve to larger radii and lower surface densities with decreasing redshift .",
    "this phenomenon is apparent from the uds data alone in figure  [ fig_smass ] , but is most starkly illustrated by the @xmath47 sdss panel where essentially no massive , compact galaxies are visible .",
    "this re - illustrates the phenomenon pointed out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but with multiple redshift bins the depletion of these galaxies is now easily seen .",
    "since these galaxies are unlikely to be losing more than a small fraction of their mass ( via mass loss from evolved stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , size evolution must be the primary driver behind their disappearance .",
    "lcc sdss & @xmath84 & @xmath85 + @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + @xmath89 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 + @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94    the trends shown in figure  [ fig_smass ] could in principle be affected by certain assumptions we have made .",
    "first , a minimum ssfr of @xmath95 yr@xmath96 has been imposed as an lower limit to what can be measured with sed fitting ; however , varying this limit only serves to shift the apparent `` quiescence threshold '' in this figure , without affecting the overall trends .",
    "again , the absolute radius , mass , and ssfr values may exhibit some systematic offsets between the sdss and uds samples due to different fitting and calculation methods , but the _ relative _ values within each frame ( and between the three uds redshift bins ) are generally consistent .",
    "it is also possible that some degeneracies may exist between the mass and ssfr estimates used here since both stem from the same template fits ( and hence are nt entirely independent quantities ) . to test the robustness of these results , we reproduced figure  [ fig_smass ] using the swire 24@xmath97 m data in this field as a fully independent ssfr diagnostic .",
    "a relation between the ssfr and @xmath98 ( with a minor correction using @xmath99 to account for low - mass blue galaxies ) is presented in ( * ? ? ?",

    "does not significantly change the results shown in figure  [ fig_smass ] ( though it is somewhat noisier , due to the shallowness of the swire 24@xmath97 m data ) .",
    "the strong size and surface density evolution of the `` red and dead '' galaxy population , and the apparent `` disappearance '' of the most compact objects , presents an intriguing puzzle for observers and theorists alike . in order to take full advantage of the unprecedented sample size of the uds and",
    "provide constraints for present and future models , we now turn to quantifying these trends .",
    "figure  [ fig_sizesd ] shows the sizes and surface densities of @xmath101 m@xmath69 galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "this mass limit is equivalent ( given the difference in imf ) to the limits employed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quiescent galaxies ( selected via the  quiescent red sequence  method described in the appendix and by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are shown in red , and star - forming galaxies are shown in blue .",
    "@xcite note that any proposed models for the size evolution of quiescent galaxies ( in particular those relying on dry mergers ) are additionally constrained by the co - moving mass and/or number densities of these galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the right - hand panel of this figure thus shows the number density evolution of quiescent galaxies with @xmath102 ; this was calculated at @xmath37 with galaxy counts in three redshift bins from the uds , and at @xmath47 by integrating the sdss value added galaxy catalog mass function tabulated by @xcite .",

    ", @xcite find that effective radii of early - type galaxies with @xcite masses @xmath170m@xmath69 ( equivalent to our mass limit ) are @xmath171 times smaller at @xmath172 than @xmath6 and @xmath173 times smaller at @xmath1 . in both size and surface density the evolution",
    "they infer is somewhat slower than what we find ; this might be a result of different sample selection methods .",
    "they also derive a comoving _ mass _ density equal to @xmath174% of the local value at @xmath172 and @xmath175% at @xmath176 , while our _ number _ density evolution is somewhat shallower than this ( although roughly consistent between @xmath6 and 1 ) , implying significant mass growth in the existing quiescent galaxy population over these redshifts .",
    "the above fits include galaxies spanning a somewhat wide range of masses ( @xmath177 ) , but with this large sample it is possible to investigate the growth of galaxies as a function of stellar mass . table  [ tab_massfit ] lists size evolution power - law indices ( @xmath178 ) and normalizations ( @xmath179 ) for these same quiescent and star - forming subsamples ( as well as the total sample ) in three narrower mass bins . a strong trend is immediately apparent : more massive galaxies undergo significantly faster size evolution with redshift .",
    "for the total sample @xmath178 steepens from @xmath180 to @xmath181 between stellar masses of @xmath182 and @xmath170@xmath183 , and from about @xmath184 to @xmath185 over the same mass interval for both the quiescent and star - forming subsamples .",
    "a similar trend was also noted by @xcite .",
    "although this could in principle be due to systematic galaxy mass overestimates at high redshift , such offsets would need to be quite large and redshift - dependent ( e.g. , @xmath186dex too high at @xmath3 , but correct at @xmath187 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is strong evidence for differential size evolution with mass .    as noted in the appendix , a number of other physically - meaningful definitions of `` quiescence '' are possible and may be simpler to define within certain models .",
    "we thus repeated the power law fits to other @xmath177 quiescent galaxy samples defined through the other two selection methods described in the appendix , i.e. based on low best - fit ssfr ( @xmath188 ) and red rest - frame colors ( @xmath61 ) . for completeness we performed the same fits to the size and surface density evolution of the complementary samples ( star - forming and blue ) , as well as all massive galaxies in this sample .",
    "errors on the power - law slopes were computed using bootstrap resampling .",
    "the results of these fits are tabulated , along with the reference `` quiescent red sequence '' sample , in table  [ tab_fit ] .",
    "the sizes and surface densities of the different samples evolve at similar rates ( differing by no more than @xmath189 for any two `` equivalent '' samples , e.g.  low - ssfr and quiescent red sequence ) .",
    "the observed structural evolution thus appears to be more or less independent of the exact technique used to select quiescent galaxies .",
    "interestingly , massive galaxies overall exhibit slower evolution than either of the star - forming or `` dead '' subsamples ; this is simply a consequence of the increasing fraction of massive quiescent galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "from the preceding sections it is clear that star formation and galaxy structure are tightly coupled . while it was already established that such correlations exist @xcite , the order - of - magnitude larger galaxy sample provided by the uds allows us to not only observe and quantitatively measure said correlations , but also to investigate how uniformly the galaxy population at high redshift is described by them . in this final section",
    "we present some alternate tests of the connection between structure and star formation , with the specific goal of qualitatively understanding the degree to which these relations are `` universal . ''",
    "average seds are an invaluable tool for ascertaining both the underlying spectral shapes of large galaxy samples and the scatter ( or lack thereof ) in their seds . to determine whether dense galaxies are universally quiescent , we separate all @xmath35 , @xmath18 uds galaxies into four _ surface density _ bins and construct average rest - frame seds using their observed , de - redshifted photometric data points .",
    "figure  [ fig_avgsed ] shows these photometric data ( normalized at 8000 ) in each bin ; median and 75% dispersion values of the individual galaxy points in bins of rest - frame wavelength are overplotted . to guide the eye ,",
    "four @xcite stellar population models ( from bottom to top , one single - burst model with age 1gyr , and three constant star - forming with increasing levels of dust obscuration ) are also shown in each panel ; note that these are _ not _ fits to the data .",
    "this figure provides a nearly model - independent confirmation of the result shown in figure  [ fig_smass ] : namely , that the densest galaxies exhibit an average spectral shape that is well - represented by an evolved stellar population , with remarkably low dispersion .",
    "interestingly , there appears to be a smooth progression between average surface density and dust properties : galaxies with the lowest @xmath190 are typically blue and have low dust obscuration , but with increasing surface density the seds become dustier .",
    "it is especially notable that this does not appear to be caused by the addition of progressively more quiescent galaxies to the blue galaxy population ; at least in the lowest two @xmath191 bins , the median seds are unambiguously within the `` dusty '' regime .",
    "thus , it appears that there is not only an anticorrelation between ssfr and surface density , but also a positive correlation between _ dust _ and surface density for star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , since the ssfr is a mass - normalized quantity and the ( qualitative ) dust obscuration seen in figure  [ fig_avgsed ] is not , we caution that this last point may be entirely due to more massive galaxies containing more total dust .    more importantly , the sed dispersion of the highest - density galaxies is at least a factor of 2 lower than for less - dense galaxies .",
    "this strongly implies that the highest density galaxies are overwhelmingly represented by a single model with relatively few outliers ; at lower surface densities , on the other hand , galaxies show larger dispersions in their spectra and thus span a range of spectral shapes . the comparatively low scatter in the high density galaxies",
    "further reinforces the idea that they are by and large quiescent : if they instead were predominantly red due to dust obscuration , they would most likely exhibit large dispersions comparable to the seds in the lower - density bins .",
    "a quiescent galaxy model also provides a somewhat closer representation of the 4000  break region than the @xmath192 model , but the models underpredict the observed uv flux in these galaxies , indicating that there may be some contribution from very dusty starbursts or low levels of residual star formation in the `` quiescent '' galaxies .      up until now",
    "we have primarily investigated the star - formation ( and sed ) properties of galaxies as a function of structural parameters .",
    "we now consider the converse question : what are the structural parameters of galaxies as a function of their star - formation properties ?",
    "@xcite describe the use of the rest - frame @xmath7 vs. @xmath56 ( hereafter @xmath193 ) diagram as a powerful diagnostic of both star - formation activity and dust obscuration .",
    "figure  [ fig_z12 ] shows this diagram for all @xmath35 galaxies in the uds . in short ,",
    "quiescent galaxies fall in a discrete clump in the upper left - hand region of this plot ( above the dashed line ) , while star - forming galaxies form a `` dust sequence '' extending from the lower - left ( blue ) to upper - right ( red ) region .",
    "the utility of this plot as a star - formation diagnostic was confirmed using stacked @xmath100 m data ; a more thorough discussion is provided in the appendix .    in each panel of figure  [ fig_z12 ] galaxies",
    "have been binned and color - coded by their median ( a ) ssfr , ( b ) mass , ( c ) effective radius , and ( d ) surface density . in the first panel we confirm with our sed - based ssfr estimates",
    "what was previously shown by @xcite with @xmath100 m data  the `` quiescent red sequence '' ( above the dashed diagonal line ) is indeed overwhelmingly populated by quiescent galaxies , while red galaxies that do not lie on this sequence have significant star formation , and are thus dusty starbursts . panels ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate how most quiescent galaxies have large masses and small effective radii , but some systematic variation is clearly present ( due to the size - mass relation ) .",
    "however , in the final panel it is evident that quiescent galaxies almost uniformly exhibit high _ surface densities _ ; there appears to be little variation in surface density with either mass or size along the quiescent red sequence .",
    "the converse also appears to hold true : the highest - density galaxies almost entirely fall within the `` quiescent '' region , confirming the result shown in figure  [ fig_avgsed ] ( although some of the reddest star - forming galaxies exhibit densities approaching those of quiescent galaxies ) .",
    "though useful for illustrating the utility of the @xmath193 diagram , figure  [ fig_z12 ] spans a fairly wide redshift range and may also contain systematic effects due to incompleteness at low masses .",
    "we therefore re - plot panels ( c - d ) , the size and surface density as a function of color , in figure  [ fig_rfcol_sd ] for four redshift bins .",
    "a mass limit of @xmath65 ( the 75% red - galaxy mass completeness limit at @xmath67 ) is also imposed ; thus , this figure is complete only up to @xmath1 and we caution that the @xmath194 bin likely suffers from some incompleteness effects as well as larger uncertainties in the masses and rest - frame colors .",
    "the color - color plots shown in figure  [ fig_rfcol_sd ] present a wealth of information about the structural evolution of massive galaxies , and indeed provide a novel view of the results presented thus far .",
    "first , at all redshifts , quiescent galaxies ( above the dashed line in each plot ) exhibit small radii and large surface densities , though their surface densities are far more uniform than their sizes .",
    "however , while most massive compact galaxies are quiescent , the same is not always true for massive , high - surface density galaxies : at @xmath3 there are many dense , star - forming galaxies , but the number of such objects drops dramatically with decreasing redshift , suggesting that galaxies become quiescent at progressively lower surface densities with time . even with this effect taken into account , it remains clear that the quiescent galaxy population undergoes dramatic structural changes from @xmath1 to 0 , so another mechanism must be at work to bring about this transformation .",
    "by combining size measurements of a very large @xmath11selected galaxy sample with sed fitting to determine sfrs and masses , we find that quiescent galaxies at all redshifts are far more compact than star - forming galaxies of comparable mass .",
    "similar results have been found by other authors at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but with the larger sample size considered here , detailed investigations into the correlations between galaxy structure and star formation ( and their evolution with redshift ) are now possible .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_smass ] , a well - defined mass - size relation for quiescent galaxies exists up to at least @xmath1 , but evolves to larger sizes with decreasing redshift .",
    "this figure also shows a clear anticorrelation between star formation activity and stellar mass surface density ( nearly independent of mass ) , and an evolving surface density `` threshold '' above which galaxies are predominantly quiescent , confirming the findings of @xcite .",
    "the effective radii of @xmath177 quiescent galaxies in this sample evolve as @xmath195 between @xmath196 , with the power - law index varying only slightly depending on the exact definition of quiescence ( see table  [ tab_fit ] ) ; this is in excellent agreement with the @xmath197 `` upsizing '' observed by @xcite in a smaller sample from @xmath198 , and the factor @xmath199 size evolution since @xmath200 seen by @xcite .",
    "however , the slope of the size evolution varies strongly with _ mass _ , such that the most massive galaxies show the fastest mass evolution ( see table  [ tab_massfit ] ) .",
    "@xcite found evidence for similar mass - dependent evolution of `` disk - like '' galaxies between @xmath201 ; the sample presented here confirms that this result extends to higher redshifts and applies to the entire quiescent galaxy population .",
    "the evolution in the uds sample also agrees well with other previous studies specifically focusing on early - type galaxies ; for example , @xcite find a factor of @xmath202 growth in size from @xmath172 to the present and a factor of @xmath203 since @xmath1 , which agrees with the observed evolution in our `` quiescent red sequence '' sample . on the other hand , we find all galaxies above @xmath204 exhibit size evolution with a power - law index of @xmath103 , slightly faster than the @xcite index of @xmath205 ; however , this may simply be due to the different redshift ranges considered .",
    "the total massive galaxy sample grows more slowly in size than either quiescent or star - forming subsamples of similar mass , highlighting the increasing dominance of `` dead '' ellipticals over starbursts at lower redshifts .    in the highest redshift bin , @xmath67 ,",
    "we see a population of ultra - compact , high - density quiescent galaxies that are no longer present in the local universe , or even ( for the most part ) at @xmath206 .",
    "studies with higher - resolution data find that the typical sizes of @xmath68m@xmath69 quiescent galaxies at @xmath207 are @xmath208kpc @xcite , and at @xmath0 no quiescent galaxies with @xmath209kpc are seen @xcite .",
    "although 1kpc is smaller than what we can confidently measure for individual galaxies , this size is consistent with our measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig_smass ] does , however suggest the presence of quiescent galaxies at @xmath210 with somewhat extended radii ( @xmath211kpc ) .",
    "a few such objects are also seen at similar redshifts ( and with space - based imaging ) by @xcite ; thus , the difference may simply be due to mild evolution of these galaxies from @xmath207 to @xmath66 .",
    "follow - up observations of candidate _",
    "extended _ quiescent galaxies at @xmath3 would confirm or rule out their existence , and perhaps shed some light on the mechanism behind the size evolution .",
    "the presence of ultra - compact massive galaxies with extreme surface densities ( and velocity dispersions ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath0 is puzzling , since the prevalence of such objects is already diminished substantially by @xmath212 @xcite and they effectively no longer exist at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "major and minor mergers , in particular those involving only gas - poor galaxies ( `` dry mergers '' ) , likely play a significant role in both the mass and size evolution of these objects @xcite .",
    "however , as suggested by @xcite , other processes are also likely to be important , in particular the quenching of progressively larger star - forming galaxies at lower redshift .",
    "indeed , this may account for the seemingly incongruous result that the quiescent and star - forming samples each evolve faster than the overall galaxy population .",
    "in other words , if the compact , high - surface - density `` tail '' of the star - forming galaxy population is preferentially quenched at any given redshift , this will accelerate the apparent evolution of both subsamples .",
    "the strong size growth of both massive star - forming and quiescent galaxies by itself suggests that major gas - poor ( `` dry '' ) mergers are not the only process driving massive galaxies strong structural evolution .",
    "galaxies which are undergoing significant star - formation must contain substantial amounts of gas , and therefore by definition can not undergo dry mergers .",
    "however , the sizes and densities of massive star - forming galaxies are seen to evolve at a rate similar to the quiescent galaxies .",
    "it is therefore possible that at least one of the mechanisms acting on compact quiescent galaxies similarly affects star - forming galaxies .",
    "another proposed mechanism is adiabatic expansion , whereby mass loss from evolved stars decreases the potential well depth and therefore increases effective radii as galaxies age . as discussed by @xcite , however , such a mechanism does not seem feasible because only a small fraction of the total mass is expected to be lost in passively - evolving stellar populations between @xmath212 and @xmath6 .",
    "the size growth may also be explained by many minor mergers or the accretion of relatively low - mass satellites .",
    "@xcite point out that minor mergers are more efficient at increasing the radii of the primary galaxy than major mergers , per unit mass of the secondary galaxies .",
    "this scenario is also particularly attractive because it would depend only weakly ( if at all ) on whether or not the central galaxy is forming stars , and therefore could explain the size growth of both massive and quiescent galaxies . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will investigate the role of major and minor mergers on massive galaxy evolution ( r.  j.  williams et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "although it is yet unclear what causes the observed size and surface density evolution of massive galaxies , the results presented herein illustrate how large , ground - based , near - ir surveys can provide large statistical samples , with sufficiently accurate size measurements , for comparison with the variety of theoretical models now under development .",
    "upcoming instruments like vista and wfc3 will greatly enhance the volume and quality of available data ; however , the proliferation of complementary observational results from existing surveys already present an important challenge to , and constraints on , these models .",
    "by applying accurate size measurements and broadband sed fitting to the largest photometric sample of massive galaxies from @xmath78 to date , we have investigated in detail the interplay between star formation , galaxy structure , and mass , and its evolution with redshift .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "galaxies with low ssfrs follow a well - defined mass - size relation up to at least @xmath1 , and this relation moves to larger sizes at lower redshifts .",
    "the anticorrelation between stellar mass surface density and star formation activity is much stronger than the size - ssfr relation ; this confirms the result of @xcite that surface density and star formation are tightly connected at all redshifts .",
    "3 .   even with the far larger galaxy sample studied here , the densest",
    ", most massive galaxies seen at @xmath3 have essentially disappeared by @xmath206 .",
    "4 .   the sizes and surface densities of massive quiescent and star - forming galaxies evolve smoothly with time ( following simple power - law behavior in @xmath213 ) , with more massive galaxies exhibiting faster evolution .",
    "although galaxies with low surface densities exhibit a wide range of dust and star - formation properties , at the highest surface densities their seds are well - represented by a single quiescent galaxy model ; thus , these `` dense '' galaxies comprise a relatively homogeneous population .",

    "the primary goal of this work is to investigate the structural properties and evolution of quiescent galaxies , defined as those falling below some ssfr threshold . in practice",
    "there are a number of ways to define such a sample , particularly when only broadband photometric data are available . in this appendix",
    "we describe the primary selection technique employed for this analysis ( the @xmath193 color - color selection described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as two alternate methods considered in  [ sec_rfsize ] .",
    "average seds of the quiescent galaxies selected via these three techniques are shown in figure  [ fig_asedred ] .",
    "note that these three average seds appear quite similar , suggesting that the three techniques are effective at selecting quiescent galaxies ( though we caution that very dusty galaxies would not clearly stand out in these plots ; see the models in figure  [ fig_avgsed ] ) .      for the most part",
    ", galaxies which have ceased their star formation activity appear red due to their evolved stellar populations , and up to @xmath212 or higher ( depending on the data quality ) form a well - defined `` red sequence '' when plotted in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "however , at higher redshifts progressively larger numbers of dusty starbursts are present , and these often exhibit optical colors which mimic `` red and dead '' galaxies , making the red sequence methods less reliable ( especially with only broadband photometric data ) . as shown by @xcite , incorporating rest - frame near - ir data into the analysis makes it possible to distinguish between dead and dusty galaxies .",
    "in particular , quiescent and star - forming galaxies occupy distinct regions of the rest - frame @xmath7 vs.  @xmath56 ( @xmath193 ) color space ; with the ukidss uds and overlapping data , @xcite found that a `` _ quiescent _ red sequence '' is clearly visible ( and distinct from dusty star - forming galaxies ) in the @xmath193 distribution up to @xmath1 , and criteria based on these colors provide an effective physical basis for separating quiescent from star - forming galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig_z12 ] ( left ) shows the @xmath193 diagram for all galaxies between @xmath214 in the uds with @xmath18 .",
    "the quiescent galaxy selection criterion defined in @xcite is shown as a dashed line , where quiescent galaxies lie above and to the left of the line and star - forming galaxies are below . for reference ,",
    "the criterion at @xmath35 is : @xmath215 at lower redshifts the criterion changes slightly , shifting upwards by 0.1 dex ( i.e. the @xmath216 becomes @xmath217 ) . additional constraints of @xmath218 and @xmath219 are imposed to prevent too many star - forming galaxies from scattering into the selection region .",
    "we note that some of the galaxies defined via this method as `` passive '' may nonetheless still have emission in the mid - ir from dusty star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "when we compare this technique to deep @xmath100 m imaging in the chandra deep field - south , we find that 4 out of 29 `` quiescent red sequence '' galaxies at @xmath1 have significant @xmath100 m emission .",
    "hence this classification is not a guarantee that a given galaxy has no star formation . on average , however , as shown by @xcite for this field , the @xmath100 m emission is very low for these galaxies .",
    "this empirical `` quiescent red sequence '' method is preferred to , e.g. , sed fitting because photometric redshifts ( as well as interpolated rest - frame colors based on these redshifts and observed fluxes ) are typically the best - constrained parameter in broadband sed fitting . by providing a directly empirical criterion ,",
    "the rest - frame color separation is also less subject to template - dependent systematics that may affect sed - based ssfrs .",
    "we therefore adopt this color - color cut as our primary method for selecting quiescent galaxy samples .",
    "since the @xmath193 technique is relatively new and some theoretical models may better predict sfrs , we consider a sample ( listed as ssfr@xmath75 in table  [ tab_fit ] ) based on an evolving cut in galaxy ssfrs . in this case ,",
    "quiescent galaxies are defined as those exhibiting ssfrs less than 0.3/@xmath220 , where @xmath220 is the age of the universe for each galaxy at redshift @xmath221 , analogous to the quiescent galaxy definitions employed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the factor 0.3 is somewhat arbitrary , but is comparable to the ssfrs of red sequence galaxies in our sdss subsample .",
    "finally , one of the simplest criteria that can be defined is a single rest - frame color cut , i.e. assuming that all galaxies redder than a certain value are quiescent . as noted before this method is somewhat flawed because sufficiently dusty starburst galaxies can mimic the colors of truly `` red and dead '' galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , for completeness we construct a third sample with rest - frame @xmath222 irrespective of ssfr .",

    "<S> the presence of massive , compact , quiescent galaxies at @xmath0 presents a major challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution . using one of the deepest large public near - ir surveys to date </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters ( size , stellar mass , and surface density ) from @xmath1 to the present . </S>",
    "<S> at all redshifts , massive quiescent galaxies ( i.e. those with little or no star formation ) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass - size correlation , while star - forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly - homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation , while less dense galaxies exhibit high star - formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration . both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies </S>",
    "<S> evolve strongly from @xmath2 ; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power law functions and present best - fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> higher - mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution , consistent with previous results . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , star - forming galaxies sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations , suggesting that `` dry mergers '' may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution . </S>"
