    "the possibility to form electrically - induced n - p and n - i - p junctions  @xcite in gated graphene layers ( gls ) , as well as lateral arrays of graphene nanoribbons and graphene bilayer opens up prospects of creation novel electronic and optoelectronic devices  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to gl structures with chemically doped n- and p - region in the gl structures with electrically - induced n - p and n - i - p junctions , there is a possibility of their voltage control .",
    "recent success in fabricating high - quality multiple gls  @xcite stimulates an interest in different prospective devices in which the utilization of multiple - gl structures ( stacks of disoriented gls ) instead of single - gl structures can provide a significant improvement of their performance .",
    "such devices include , in particular , terahertz tunneling transit - time oscillators ( similar to that considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , lasers with optical and electrical pumping , and high performance interband photodetectors  @xcite .",
    "gated multiple - gl structures can be also used in high - frequency field - effect transistors  @xcite and other devices ( the terahertz frequency multipliers , and plasmonic devices ) .",
    "however the penetration of the electric field ( transverse to the gl plane ) beyond the topmost gl as well as its sceening by electron or hole charges in gls can substantially limit the influence of the gates ( the effect of the quantum capacitance  @xcite ) . in this paper , we study the influence of screening in gated multiple - gl structures on the formation and characteristics of n- or p - regions and n - i - p junctions in these structures .",
    "we calculate the electron and hole fermi energies and densities in gls in the n- and p - regions as functions of the gl index , gate voltage , and temperature . using these data , we find the voltage and temperature dependences of the reverse current in the n - i - p junctions with different structural parameters .",
    "let us consider a multiple - gl structure with the side ohmic contacts to all gls and two split gates ( isolated from gls ) on the top of this structure as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . applying the positive ( @xmath0 ) or negative ( @xmath1 ) voltage between the gate and the adjacent contact ( gate voltage ) ,",
    "one can obtain the electrically - induced n- or p - region . in the single- and multiple - gl structures with two split top gates under the voltages of different polarity",
    ", one can create lateral n - p or n - i - p junctions .",
    "generally , the source - drain voltage @xmath2 can be applied between the side ohmic contacts to gls .",
    "depending on the polarity of this voltage , the n - p and n - i - p junctions can be either direct or reverse biased .",
    "we assume that the potentials of the first ( source ) contact and the pertinent gate are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and the potentials of another gate and contact ( drain ) are @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 .",
    "if the slot between the gates @xmath8 is sufficiently wide ( markedly exceeds the thickness of the gate layer @xmath9 separating the gates and the topmost gl ) , there are intrinsic i - regions in each gl under the slot .",
    "thus the n - i - p junction is formed .",
    "the pertinent band diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) .",
    "since the side contacts are the ohmic contacts , the electron fermi energy in the @xmath10-th gl sufficiently far from the contacts are given by @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the electron charge and @xmath13 is the potential of the @xmath10-th gl , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of gls in the structure , @xmath16 is the spacing between gls , and the axis @xmath17 is directed perpendicular to the gl plane with @xmath18 corresponding to the topmost gl and @xmath19 - to the lowest one .",
    "focusing on the n - region ( the p - region can be considered in a similar way ) and introducing the dimensionless potential @xmath20 , one can arrive at the following one - dimensional poisson equation governing the potential distribution in the @xmath17-direction ( in the n - region ) : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the dielectric constant , @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the equilibrium sheet densities in the @xmath10-th gl of electrons and holes , respectively . these densities , taking into account the linear dispersion low for electrons and holes in graphene , are expressed via the electron fermi energy as    @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electron and hole density in the intrinsic graphene at the temperature @xmath29 , @xmath30  cm / s is the characteristic velocity of electrons and holes in graphene , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the planck and boltzmann constants , respectively .",
