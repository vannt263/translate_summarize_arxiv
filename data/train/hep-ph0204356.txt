    "extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath2 is one of the crucial ingredients needed to determine the source of cp violation .",
    "a number of methods have been suggested for extraction of this matrix element , both from inclusive and exclusive decays . in this note , we point out that , modulo @xmath3 , @xmath4 and isospin corrections , the ratio @xmath1 can be determined using the predictions of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , and the measurement of some polarization observables in the decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in a model independent way .    among the many measurements proposed for the proposed cleo - c are precision studies of the semileptonic decays @xmath7 and @xmath5 : it is expected that the ratio @xmath8 can be measured to 1.3% . in particular , there should be ample statistics to study the polarization of the vector mesons produced in the latter reaction . if this is the case , and if similar measurements can be done at the @xmath0 factories , we propose measurements that can provide the advertised ratio of ckm matrix elements with very small theoretical errors .    in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the predictions of hqet for these heavy @xmath9 light transitions , at leading order .",
    "section iii discusses a number of experimental observables from these processes , and their dependence on the form factors describing these semileptonic decays . in that section , we also present the observables that allow extraction of the advertised ratio .",
    "in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements for the decays @xmath7 and @xmath5 are @xmath10 where the light quark @xmath11 can be either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "these decays are thus described in terms of six independent , _ a priori _ unknown form factors .",
    "the terms in @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unimportant when the lepton mass is ignored , since @xmath16 for the transitions from @xmath0 mesons , an analogous set of matrix elements and form factors are necessary .    using the dirac matrix representation of heavy mesons ,",
    "we may treat heavy - to - light transitions using the same trace formalism that has been applied to heavy - to - heavy transitions @xcite . in the effective theory ,",
    "a heavy pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath17 or @xmath0 ) , denoted @xmath18 , traveling with velocity @xmath19 is represented as @xcite @xmath20 these states are normalized so that @xmath21 the states of qcd and hqet are therefore related by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the pseudoscalar meson .    for the semileptonic transitions between",
    "such a heavy meson ( @xmath18 meson ) and a light pseudoscalar ( @xmath24 ) , the matrix element of interest is @xcite @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the heavy quark in the effective theory , and @xmath11 denotes a light quark ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) . for the transition to a light vector ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the matrix elements are written @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "the form factors @xmath32 are independent of the mass of the heavy quark , and are therefore universal functions .",
    "thus , they are valid for @xmath33 decays , as well as for @xmath34 decays .",
    "this independence of the quark mass allows us to deduce , in a relatively straightforward manner , the scaling behavior of the usual form factors that describe these transitions @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they allow us to relate the form factors for @xmath17 transitions to those for @xmath0 transitions .",
    "the relationships are    @xmath35 , \\nonumber\\\\ f_-^b(v\\cdot p)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_b}{m_d}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left[f_-^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(1+\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right ) + f_+^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}-1\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ f^b(v\\cdot p)&=&\\left(\\frac{m_b}{m_d}\\right)^{1/2}f^d(v\\cdot p ) , \\nonumber\\\\ g^b(v\\cdot p)&=&\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right)^{1/2}g^d(v\\cdot p ) , \\nonumber\\\\ a_+^b(v\\cdot p)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left[a_+^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(1+\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right ) + a_-^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}-1\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ a_-^b(v\\cdot p)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left[a_-^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(1+\\frac{m_d}{m_b}\\right ) + a_+^d(v\\cdot p)\\left(\\frac{m_d}{m_b}-1\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the form factor appropriate to the @xmath37 transition , while @xmath38 is the form factor appropriate to the @xmath39 transition , and quantities on the left - hand - sides of eqns .",
    "( [ ffmix ] ) are evaluated at the same values of @xmath40 as those on the right - hand - sides .",
    "omitted from each of eqn .",
    "( [ ffmix ] ) is a qcd scaling factor .    in the limit of a heavy @xmath41 quark ,",
    "the full current of qcd is replaced by @xcite @xmath42^{-\\frac{6}{25}}.\\ ] ] this arises from integrating out the @xmath41 quark , and matching the resulting effective theory onto full qcd at the scale @xmath43 , at one loop level . at the scale @xmath44 , we must also integrate out the @xmath45 quark , but there is also the effect due to running between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the net effect of this is that the form factors @xmath32 appropriate to the @xmath46 transitions are related to those for the @xmath47 transitions by @xmath48^{-\\frac{6}{25}}.\\ ] ]",
    "in the differential decay rate of @xmath49 , terms that depend on the form factor @xmath14 are proportional to the mass of the lepton , and are thus very difficult to extract from experiment . detecting the polarization of the charged lepton offers the only possibility of extracting this form factor , but",
    "this is apparently a very remote prospect with muons or electrons . because of the predicted mixing of @xmath50 and @xmath14 in hqet , it becomes very difficult to say anything about @xmath51 observables based on information extracted from the corresponding @xmath52 observables .",
    "assumptions about the form of @xmath14 can be and have been made , but this introduces some model dependence into any information extracted .    for the decay to the @xmath27 ,",
    "helicity amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be defined as h_(q^2)&=&f(q^2)m_p k_g(q^2 ) , + h_0(q^2)&= & , where @xmath55 is the momentum of the daughter @xmath27 in the rest frame of the parent pseudoscalar . in terms of these",
    ", the differential decay rate is written @xcite [ angles ] & = & + & & \\{^2_. + & + & 4 ^ 2_^2_|h_0(q^2)|^2- 2 ^ 2_^2_h_+(q^2)h_-(q^2 ) + & + & 4h_0(q^2 ) + & & . } , where @xmath56 for @xmath0 decays , and @xmath57 for @xmath17 decays . the angles @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are explained in the figure",
    ".    with sufficient statistics in both @xmath0 and @xmath17 decays , this differential decay rate can provide means of extracting the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "the differential decay rates into specific helicity states of the @xmath27 can be written as = k_|h_i(q^2)|^2 .",
    "much of the difficulty of saying anything about the total rate in @xmath6 , based on measurements of @xmath5 , remains because of the mixing of @xmath61 and @xmath15 . as with the decays to pions , @xmath15 is , for the most part , only accessible through measurement of the polarization of the charged lepton .",
    "however , decays to transversely polarized @xmath27 mesons are independent of this form factor , depending only on @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 can be measured or extracted at cleo - c , and @xmath65 at @xmath0 factories , the ratio of these two differential decay rates , at the same kinematic point @xmath40 ( @xmath66 in the rest frame of the parent hadron ) , depends only on known or measurable kinematic quantities , as the form factor dependence drops out at leading order in hqet .",
    "actually , this is not quite true",
    ". this ratio will depend on the form factor ratio @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 but this ratio should be extractable from other observables in the @xmath5 decay .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath69 since the numerator and denominator of this ratio are evaluated at the same value of @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in the expression above , q_b^2=m_b^2+m_^2 - 2m_b vp , q_d^2=m_d^2+m_^2 - 2m_d vp .",
    "the combination @xmath72 is more easily accessible in these experiments ( as the term proportional to @xmath73 in the expression for the decay rate ) .",
    "the ratio of this quantity for @xmath0 decays to that for @xmath17 decays is = .",
    "in addition , the differential rate @xmath74 , proportional to @xmath75 may also be accessible ( as the term proportional to @xmath76 in the expression for the decay rate ) .",
    "if this is measured in @xmath0 and @xmath17 decays , the ratio is = .",
    "this ratio again depends only on known or measurable kinematic quantities , and the form factor ratio @xmath77 .",
    "far more intriguing is the ratio of the difference of these differential helicity decay rates , related to the differential lepton forward - backward asymmetry , and proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this ratio takes the form @xmath79 where a factor of @xmath80 has been set to unity , as explained above .",
    "inclusion of the lowest order radiative corrections means that the ratios above must be multiplied by the factor @xmath81^{-\\frac{12}{25}}$ ] .    at leading order ,",
    "the last ratio of observables is completely independent of any form factor , and so should provide a very good means of extracting the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "we have suggested three measurements that can allow the extraction of @xmath1 in an absolutely model independent manner . however , our results are subject to a number of corrections , which we discuss briefly here .",
    "one correction that must be taken into account is isospin breaking . for the @xmath17 mesons ,",
    "the possible decay modes are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while the corresponding @xmath0 decay modes are @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the predictions given in the previous section implicitly assume that the light component of the heavy meson is the same for both the @xmath17 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "this means that comparisons can be made between the decays of the @xmath86 and those of the @xmath87 , or between the decays of the @xmath88 and those of the @xmath89 . in each of these comparisons ,",
    "the daughter @xmath27 is different , so some assumption of isospin invariance among the form factors has to be made .",
    "departures from this invariance can be expected to be small .",
    "there is also an implicit assumption of isospin invariance in the discussion of the radiative factor of @xmath90^{-\\frac{12}{25}}$ ] .    by",
    "far the larger corrections are expected to come from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions to the matrix elements of interest . for decays to pions ,",
    "the @xmath91 corrections require the introduction of eight new universal form factors .",
    "the number of new form factors required for the decays to @xmath27 mesons will be twice that number .",
    "for the decays to pions , burdman and collaborators @xcite have used chiral symmetry arguments to obtain estimates of the normalizations of some of the new form factors at the non - recoil point , @xmath92 .",
    "it is not clear that analogous estimates can be obtained for the @xmath93 and @xmath94 form factors .    the very nice result obtained in the previous section",
    "will undoubtedly be spoiled by @xmath91 corrections .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe it , one can hope that such corrections are small .",
    "it is possible that , in the ratio of differential decay rates , this turns out to be the case .",
    "this , however , is speculation . nevertheless , perhaps the measurements suggested are of sufficient interest for the @xmath91 corrections to be studied in detail in the near future .",
