    "the power of the pushing beam @xmath43 has been set to 2.8  mw in order to prepare the cloud in a pure f=3 quantum state .",
    "then , the efficiency of the pumping beam has been verified by measuring the remaining number of detected atoms in @xmath24=3 after the selection . for 0.3  mw of pump power , we reach the minimum of atoms ( 1% ) corresponding to the residual atoms in @xmath24=3 after the cooling phase .",
    "this parameters allow an efficient slicing of the atomic cloud , depicted in the fig .",

    "finally , the detection system has been tested .",
    "the master power @xmath44 has been set to 3.9  mw in order to guarantee the efficiency of the pushing beam .",
    "a pumping power @xmath45 of 20  @xmath18w ensures an optimal operation of the detection system in the test configuration where the atoms velocity is 1.3  m / s at the detection level .",
    "the detection pump power can be adjusted up to 94  @xmath46w .",
    "the power margin is then sufficient for higher launching velocities . in standard operation , due to magnetic level selection and clipping by the microwave cavity apertures ,",

    "first , we see that the relative power stability of the 6 beams remains within 1% .",
    "this is due to the small power instability correlated to the temperature .",
    "the measurements exhibit a long term drift of the laser power ( 0.3%/day ) .",
    "this small drift was caused by an anomaly in the recalibration software of the piezoelectric mirrors which has been corrected after the test .",
    "the result of the test is compliant with the power stability specification of @xmath333% .",
    "the four capture pump laser powers , which are not critical for the number of captured atoms , have also been measured and remain constant over the entire test , without apparent drifts . the number of captured and detected atoms , given on fig .",

    "a correlation analysis shows that this power has a thermal sensibility of 1%/@xmath30c .",
    "this behavior is then compliant with the power stability specification of @xmath333% .",
    "the power in the detection master laser ( @xmath44 ) , which is optically servo controlled , shows a stability below the measurement sensitivity ( @xmath490.5% ) .",
    "the power in the detection pump laser ( @xmath45 ) , which is free running , shows a 15% stability over the 65 hours considered .",
    "the measurement exhibits a small sensitivity to the temperature variations at the level of 3%/@xmath30c .",
    "it is slightly larger than the initial specification ( @xmath335% ) but the stability of this power is less critical than expected for the detection process since no significant influence on the detected atom number has been observed .",
    "nevertheless , a periodic adjustment of @xmath45 has been added after the tests in order to prevent any long - term drift .",

    "we would like to thank c. escande , p. larivire and s. beraud for their contribution to the integration and test of the laser source inside pharao .",

    "in this part , we present an estimation of the impact of the ecdl - m frequency noise and rin on the pharao clock stability .",
    "the transition probability @xmath21 of the atoms at the output of the clock is determined by measuring the ratio between the number of atoms in each ground state by a fluorescence method .",
    "the atomic cloud passes through two thin detection beams .",
    "the fluorescence signals emitted by spontaneous emission are collected on two photodiodes .",
    "the areas of these two time - of - flight signals , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are proportional to the number of atoms in each ground state .",
    "the relative frequency and intensity fluctuations of the ecdl - m induce variations on the spontaneous emission rate during the detection process .",
    "this effect results in a perturbation on the measurement of the atom number present in the detection beams .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the ratio between the number of atoms present in the first detection beam at a time t and the corresponding total time - of - flight area @xmath51 . at the time @xmath54 ,",
    "the atoms pass through the second detection beam , leading to fluctuations in the area of flight time @xmath52 .",
    "we consider a gaussian type profile for the time - of - flight signal :      the temporal width of the time - of - flight @xmath56 is connected to the initial width of the atomic cloud ( @xmath57  m ) , the launching velocity ( @xmath16 ) and the width of the velocity distribution of the atomic cloud ( @xmath58  m / s ) . the time - of - flight signal is the result of the convolution between the initial width of the cloud and the width of the velocity distribution weighted by the total flight time @xmath59 of the atoms between the capture and the detection .",
    "the temporal width of the flight time is therefore given by :      we therefore neglect the width of the probe compared to the size of the atom cloud at the time of the detection .",
    "this assumption is particularly valid when the launching velocity is low .",
    "the total flight time @xmath59 is connected to the launching velocity @xmath16 and the length between the capture zone and the detection zone ( @xmath61=0.54  m ) .",
    "we therefore have @xmath62 .",
    "the psd of the spontaneous emission rate fluctuations @xmath72 can be related to the frequency fluctuations @xmath75 and to the relative intensity noise @xmath76 of the ecdl . in this calculation",
    ", we consider the case of unsaturated atoms and of a @xmath11/2 red detuned detection laser , thereby maximizing the sensitivity to the laser frequency fluctuations .",
