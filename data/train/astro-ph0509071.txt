    "the discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has stimulated the quest for mechanism of the modern inflation .",
    "the most famous theoretical model of dark energy ( de ) is the cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding frw solution for flat universe with the present densities ratio for cold matter and dark energy ( @xmath5 ) describes satisfactorily the evolution of the universe at low redshifts  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the constant @xmath4- term has been remaining to be inexplicable during many years .",
    "it is well - known , the application of the constant @xmath4- term for modeling of the early universe was initially confronted with principal difficulties . solving the problems of the very early universe , this term has to be reducing by several order of magnitude during following evolution of the universe .",
    "this problem was solved by rejection of @xmath4- term , and corresponding inflationary behavior was determined by models of `` effective @xmath4- term''- quasi - classical scalar fields in the one way .",
    "the progress of these models is well - known . another way to describe",
    "the inflationary behavior is to take into account the polarization of vacuum of quantum fields in the early universe .",
    "taking into account of the effects of the polarization leads to the appearance of the terms non - linear on curvature in the einstein - hilbert action . in such models",
    "the inflation appears self - consistently .",
    "let us note two issues + - a correction to the einstein -hilbert action with the arbitrary function of scalar curvature @xmath6 is equivalent mathematically to the introduction of scalar field into the classical friedman cosmology@xcite ; + - the terms of the form @xmath7 were investigated in the early works done on the problem of singularity before obtaining of exact corrections to einstein action following from the one loop approximation @xcite .",
    "the part of such solutions approaches asymptotically to friedman solutions with @xmath4-term , however physical results of the solutions have not been explained at that time .    for the purpose to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe today ,",
    "it is naturally to use the experience cumulative in investigations of early universe .",
    "thus , one of the tendencies is concerned with the hypothesis of existence some scalar fields that determine the density of dark energy ( de ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the another tendency models an effective quasi - hydrodynamical tensor of momentum - energy describing the observational data @xcite . and third tendency is to generalize the einstein - hilbert equation by inclusion of curvature invariants @xcite analogously to the more early works mentioned above . the last approach one can consider to be either an independent approach to the describing of de or an analogue of inclusion of scalar fields ( in the case @xmath8 ) as stated above .    in the works on the higher order gravity theories ( hogt )",
    "the models with power corrections were investigated , however they have never been fitted to whole set of the observational data .    in this paper , the model with correction @xmath9 with @xmath10",
    "is considered in detail for the purpose to correlate it with the observational data . in the other words",
    ", we would like to obtain the model that does not conflict with the scenario of the large scale structure formation ( in past ) and describes satisfactorily the universe undergoing an accelerated expansion at present .",
    "therefore , at the minimum , in the framework of the @xmath8-theories , we will obtain solutions remind @xmath4cmd model describing well enough by set of the observational data @xcite .",
    "however , as it has been mentioned by various authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) the observational data indicates the models of the dynamical de . hence , our second aim is to search out such dynamical solutions in the framework of the hogt and to find out whether these solutions are preferable .",
    "this paper is built as follows . in the section ii the basic equations of the hogt",
    "are presented . in the section iii for the corrections of the form @xmath0",
    "we find the exponent @xmath11 which allows the generalized einstein equation for the scale factor @xmath12 to have a particular solution corresponding to the flat frw solution for cold matter .",
    "we show that instability of the solutions that are close to this particular solution at @xmath13 may lead to the accelerated behavior of the model at present and the following asymptotic approach of the solution to the solution with the constant @xmath4- term . in the section",
    "iv we discuss our results and compare them to observations . in the model",
    "there are only two free parameters of the model - the coefficient @xmath2 and a slight deviation of the parameter @xmath1 from @xmath11 mentioned above .",
    "fixed from one set of the observational data they allows to obtain the rest of the set of the observational data .",
    "we will work in the matter frame with a spatially flat frw metric @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a scale factor .",
    "the non - dimensional components of ricci scalar and ricci tensor are , @xmath16 here the present hubble parameter @xmath17 has been introduced to turn to non - dimensional values .",
    "the equations that can be derived by variation of the action @xmath18 are well - known for a long time @xcite .",
    "it is useful to reduce its @xmath19 component , that is the third order equation in @xmath12 , to the second order equation by introduction of a new function @xmath20 thus , eqs.([ricci ] ) are determined as @xmath21 and the observable parameters - the hubble parameter @xmath22 and the deceleration parameter @xmath23 - are determined by formulae @xmath24 further , the @xmath19 component of einstein equation can be represented in the form @xmath25=\\omega_{m}\\,a.\\ ] ]    the solution for the classical friedman model with cold matter is defined by @xmath26 whereas for the model with the constant @xmath4-term it is defined by @xmath27 . taken together they describe @xmath4cdm model , so , according to eqs.([riccy]),([eqy ] ) we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the cold matter density , the dark energy density , and the critical density of frw universe at present , respectively . for @xmath32-interval ( [ metric ] )",
    "the present - day observational values are close to @xmath34 .",
    "notice that the important property of eq.([eqy ] ) is a possible asymptotic exit of solutions to regime of an exponential expansion . indeed , according to definition ( [ lcdm ] )",
    "this solution is @xmath35 . in this case , the scalar curvature approaches to constant @xmath36 . in the case of a negligible effect of matter",
    "this solution is a particular solution of eq.([eqy ] ) at execution of the following condition @xmath37",
    "in this section we will investigate corrections to the einstein - hilbert action of the form @xmath38    in such a case , eq .",

    "there are two parameters in the model , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , determined by observational data . in a number of papers these parameters were chosen according to different requirements  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will choose parameter @xmath1 from requirement of closeness of evolution of the our model to the classical solution for the flat frw universe with cold matter in the past .",
    "this fact allows this scenario to be close to the scenario of the large scale structure formation .",
    "this requirement can be realized on condition the classical friedman solution @xmath40 presents a particular solution of eq.([y ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see from eq.([y ] ) , the last condition is equivalent to the choice of @xmath1 to be satisfying the equation @xmath41 the first of the roots leads to the type of models of papers  @xcite , while the second root corresponds the models with correction of the form @xmath42 investigated in the paper  @xcite .",
    "as it will be shown below , such a choice of @xmath1 approaches the model to the set of the observational data in the best way .",
    "after recombination , the evolution of the universe has to be described by the friedman model with the cold matter .",
    "the dynamics of expansion is determined by stability of the dust solution in the model ( [ y ] ) .",
    "if the solution is stable , then the model evolves in the way very close to classical one .",
    "however , the observational data at @xmath43 does not correspond to such a scenario , i.e. we are interested in dust - like solutions which are not stable in the model ( [ y ] ) but the perturbations do not grow catastrophically fast .",
    "otherwise , the model does not provides a sufficiently long period with @xmath44 at @xmath45 required for the large structure formation .    for investigation of behavior of the solution ( [ dust ] )",
    "we will search a perturbed solution in the form @xmath46 in this linear approximation and close to the recombination time ( @xmath47 ) eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) yields , @xmath48 with the damping solution @xmath49 .",
    "hence the solution ( [ dust ] ) for @xmath8-theory ( [ fr ] ) with @xmath50 satisfying eq.([eqn ] ) asymptotically approaches to to the flat frw solution , i.e. it is stable and does not satisfies the requirement stated above ) are obtained in the recent paper  @xcite for the equation equivalent to eq.([y ] ) . in @xmath8 theory ,",
    "the given exponents allow obtaining of the solutions for cold dark matter coinciding with ones in the classical friedman model of the universe .",
    "also , it has been shown in the paper  @xcite that these solutions are stable in the framework of hogt .",
    "let us notice we slightly change exponent @xmath1 in the preset work to obtain weakly unstable solutions adequate to the observational data .",
    "authors are grateful to authors of paper  @xcite kindly attracting our attention to their results . ]    as the next step on the path of the choice of @xmath1 , we will look for solutions of the @xmath8 -theories ( [ fr ] ) with @xmath1 which is a little different from @xmath51 , @xmath52 it is efficient to rewrite the condition ( [ eqn ] ) in the form @xmath53     ( a left panel ) and the hubble parameter @xmath22 ( a right panel ) with the scale factor @xmath12 are represented by the solid line .",
