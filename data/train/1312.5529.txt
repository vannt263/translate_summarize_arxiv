    "the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in atoms is a relativistic correction of the orbital energy levels .",
    "it can be understood as the interaction of the electron spin with a magnetic field that has its origin in the lorentz - transformed electrostatic field of the atomic core . in a crystalline",
    "solid , this interaction influences the band energies ; specifically , it leads to a spin splitting of electronic states with finite momentum in crystals with an inversion asymmetry . a crystallographic inversion asymmetry",
    "as it exists , e.g. , in bulk zincblende semiconductors leads to the dresselhaus soi  @xcite for conduction - band electrons .",
    "in addition , a rashba soi can be induced  @xcite in a layered structure by applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers . for electrons confined in a quantum well",
    ", the dresselhaus spin splitting depends on the quantum confinement  @xcite . for a typical material like a gaas - based quantum well , it is on the order of 100@xmath3ev@xcite at the fermi energy , which translates into a large effective magnetic field of 5 - 10 t. this makes soi an interesting tool for coherent manipulation of electronic spin states in solids . on the other hand ,",
    "the large field is a significant source for the decay of the spin polarization by the so - called dyakonov - perel mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown theoretically  @xcite that by balancing the dresselhaus and the rashba contribution to soi , the interaction attains a special symmetry with respect to the size and direction of the electron momentum and leads to the preservation of a helical spin mode . for ( 001)-oriented gaas - based quantum wells",
    ", the spin polarization of this helical mode rotates about an in - plane axis when the position is varied along the perpendicular in - plane direction .",
    "the measured decay rate of imprinted spin gratings of variable wave number  @xcite follows the theoretical prediction with a minimum decay rate at the wave number @xmath0 of a persistent spin helix  @xcite .    in a typical experimental configuration ,",
    "spin polarization is injected locally into the non - magnetic semiconductor by , e.g. , spin injection contacts  @xcite or optical orientation  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider the evolution of such spin polarization into a spin helix pattern . in general",
    ", the initial spin polarization can be described by a superposition of helical spin modes with different wave vectors @xmath4 and decay rates @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "measurements show that for a spatially confined spin excitation , this superposition evolves into a helical spin pattern that diffusively expands with time and whose wave number evolves towards @xmath0  @xcite . for a balanced soi , where the rashba soi coefficient @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the linear and cubic dresselhaus coefficients as defined below ) , the evolution of a spatially delta - shaped spin excitation can be analytically described by the product of a gaussian function and a helical mode with wave number @xmath0  @xcite . in real situations ,",
    "the spin excitation has a finite extension and soi may not be balanced . to understand the experimentally observed spin dynamics",
    ", it is important to analyze to what extend such non - idealities alter this description .    here , we theoretically study the effects that occur under realistic experimental conditions where ( i ) the rashba and dresselhaus soi are not balanced and cubic dresselhaus terms are present , ( ii ) the initial out - of - plane spin polarization has a finite spatial extension along the direction @xmath10 of the helical spin precession but is constant along the perpendicular direction @xmath11 , and ( iii ) spin polarization is localized in both in - plane directions .",
    "the model derived bridges the gap between a delta - shaped and a spatially broad excitation , i.e. , between the formation of a long - lived helical spin mode and a spatially homogeneous spin decay described by the dyakonov - perel mechanism .",
    "we find an exponential decay with a rate proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin diffusion constant .",
    "an initial spin polarization @xmath14 with finite extension along @xmath10 will be further reduced because of the transition of the relevant wave numbers from zero to @xmath0 .",
    "this latter effect is also responsible for a gradual decrease of the period of the evolving helical spin polarization .",
    "analytical results are derived on the assumption of an initial spin polarization @xmath14 that is independent of @xmath11 . if the initial spin polarization is also confined along @xmath11 , the spin eigenmodes and their dispersion exhibit anticrossings for @xmath15 .",
    "we show that the localization along @xmath11 , however , does not appreciably alter the behavior of the spin evolution apart from a trivial diffusive expansion along that direction .",
    "finally , we verify the predicted transients of the polarization amplitude and the mode wave number in an experiment in which spin polarization in a gaas quantum well is initialized in confined areas of different extensions .",
    "we first define the coordinate system and the spin - orbit coefficients .",

    "also , we assume that the soi is small compared with the fermi energy and that the initial spin polarization density is small compared with the electron sheet density .",

    "<S> the time evolution of a local spin excitation in a ( 001)-confined two - dimensional electron gas subjected to rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions of similar strength is investigated theoretically and compared with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the consequences of the finite spatial extension of the initial spin polarization is studied for non - balanced rashba and dresselhaus terms and for finite cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the initial out - of - plane spin polarization evolves into a helical spin pattern with a wave number that gradually approaches the value @xmath0 of the persistent spin helix mode . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to an exponential decay of the spin polarization that is proportional to both the spin - orbit imbalance and the cubic dresselhaus term , the finite width @xmath1 of the spin excitation reduces the spin polarization by a factor that approaches @xmath2 at longer times . </S>"
