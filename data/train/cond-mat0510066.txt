    "the prospect of using molecules as the fundamental building blocks of future nanoelectronics devices is rather innovating and exciting from the point of view of potential applications . on the fundamental side ,",
    "the field of molecular electronics also opens new directions for research because of the prominent role of phonon ( vibron ) excitations in electronic transport .",
    "the nano - objects which are connected to metallic leads may consists of individual molecules , self - assembled monolayers , or conjugated systems such as polymers and carbon nanotubes .",
    "the interplay of electron transport and molecular vibrations has triggered much interest , and unambiguous signatures of phonons have been detected in several experiments @xcite .    a recent work @xcite considered electron injection from a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip into a carbon nanotube . a single - wall carbon nanotube ( cnt )",
    "is freely suspended over a trench .",
    "the stm - tip is located near the center of the suspended part of the cnt .",
    "a dc - bias voltage @xmath0 is applied between the substrate and the stm , and the current flowing through the stm - tip - cnt - substrate structure is measured at a given tunneling distance , controlled by the setpoint current .",
    "the motivation for this special geometry is to allow for free internal vibrations to occur in the suspended portion of the nanotube , in particular the so - called radial breathing modes ( rbm ) @xcite .",
    "contrary to acoustic modes in such system , this mode has a rather high oscillation frequency , and the authors observed that conductance peaks in the current - voltage characteristics of the nanotube were surrounded by phonon side peaks , due to emission or absorption of rbm phonons .",
    "indeed , cnt display a sizeable coupling of electrons to rbm modes @xcite .",
    "the contacts to the nanotube being rather resistive , transport in this system is dominated by the coulomb blockade regime , and phonon side peaks were observed around each coulomb blockade peak in differential conductance plots .",
    "interestingly , the authors mention frequent detection of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) regions .",
    "striking ndc features also appear in a very recent work by sapmaz _",
    "@xcite , in a transport measurement of a suspended cnt , where current flows through the cnt , between two contacts at the substrate . in this work ,",
    "phonon side peaks are attributed to longitudinal stretching modes , and the steps in the @xmath1 characteristics are followed by spikes , thus displaying ndc features .",
    "the purpose of the present theoretical work is to show that such ndc features can be described quite simply using a generic model which consists of a quantum dot with a single orbital level , coupled to on - site single phonon mode , and connected to leads by tunnel junctions . due to the weak tunnel couplings ,",
    "the physics of ndc appear to be a consequence of the transport through small polaron states on the molecule .",
    "notice that polaron formation in cnt is suggested by several works @xcite .",
    "similar models have previously been considered in the literature @xcite . here",
    "we consider a molecular system  or a nanotube setup  whose tunneling matrix elements from the molecule to the leads are asymmetric , which is the case in ref . , and possibly also in ref .",
    "we propose that given this asymmetry , ndc can be obtained for a wide range of parameters and it can even be quantified by analytical means for strong asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , we argue that our approach for the description of ndc is by no means confined to the experimental geometry of ref . , which can be considered as an `` experimental paradigm '' for phonon modulated molecular transport .",
    "the present approach should apply to any molecular transport in the coulomb blockade regime where an optical - like phonon mode dominates .",
    "notice that ndc was found in ref . within a symmetric model , using an ansatz for the franck - condon factors coupling the leads to the polaron levels .",
    "catastrophic ndc was also proposed to occur in ref . , but due to an additional mechanism . in the framework of a single site model , ndc",
    "was also found in an adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed to occur in the case of two competing molecular states @xcite or within a two - site model @xcite . besides electron - phonon coupling , other physical mechanisms can lead to ndc @xcite .    in molecular electronics , one",
    "is tempted to use existing theoretical tools developed in the context of mesoscopic physics because the size of the devices allows a coherent description of the transport inside the molecule .",
    "when the molecule is connected to good contacts , and when the role of coulomb interaction and electron - phonon interactions is reduced , the landauer formulation of transport combined with a green s function calculation of the transmission coefficient serves as a good starting point for computing transport @xcite , but it then neglects the dynamical degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "phonons can be included in these approaches , analytically @xcite , or using numerical calculations @xcite based on the work of ref . .",
    "alternatively , the landauer approach can be generalized to a situation where interactions are restricted to a finite region @xcite using non - equilibrium green s functions .",
    "on the other hand , molecular contacts or the contacts to a nanotube are often of poor quality .",
    "it is then reasonable to think of the molecule as a quantum dot , which is subject to the coulomb blockade .",
    "this point of view was adopted by several authors @xcite , and is confirmed by experiments .",
    "one of the advantages of modecular electronics comes from the size of the individual nano - object which is connected to the electrodes .",
    "even at relatively large temperatures ( a few kelvins ) , the dynamics within the molecule / nanotube is fully phase coherent . on the other hand ,",
    "the tunneling rates to the reservoirs are typically small compared to temperature .",
    "one can then derive rate equations for the electron population of the dot . here",
    "our goal is to use the simplest model which can account for the physics of the experiment of ref . .",
    "we therefore derive a kinetic equation approach which can account for the observed ndc effect , treating the electron - phonon coupling non - perturbatively while still allowing for an intuitive understanding of the physics at hand .",
    "furthermore , consequences can be derived on the electron transport as well as on the non - equilibrium phonon population . in the present work the local mode",
    "is not coupled to any environmental degrees of freedom , like phonon modes or electron - hole excitations in the substrate .",
    "although such coupling is probably relevant in some experiments , the very high phonon quality factors ( @xmath2 ) obtained in other works @xcite justify to neglect it as a first step .",
    "experimentally , the addition of voltage gates on a molecular transport setup is still challenging but it is possible @xcite to approach three metallic probes in a nanometer scale region . yet , there is also a motivation to study a setup where the molecular levels are `` floating '' instead of being fixed by a gate .",
    "besides the strong asymmetry of the tunneling rates , a specific feature of our work is that ndc can occur in such absence of gate voltage , and that the ratio of the right / left capacitance plays an important role , as it dictates the location of the molecular levels .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in sec .",
    "ii , and the derivation of the rate equations is provided in sec .",
    "the general considerations about current transport and phonon occupation numbers are discussed in sec .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "v , illustrating the role of the asymmetry of the capacitances , of the shift of the dot level , and of the so - called half - shuttle mechanism on the ndc .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "although the potential relevance of our approach applies to the carbon nanotube experiments of refs . , we refer to the central region between the leads as the quantum dot .",
    "this quantum dot is weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes by tunnel junctions . in the stm geometry of refs .",
    ", the electrodes represent the stm - tip and the substrate , to which we refer as the left ( @xmath3 ) and right ( @xmath4 ) electrodes , respectively . each tunnel junction ( @xmath5 )",
    "is characterized by a resistance ( @xmath6 ) and a capacitance ( @xmath7 ) . while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constant for a given contacted nanotube sample , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of the tip - tube separation .",
    "the capacitances @xmath11 and @xmath9 are sample - dependent @xcite . for generality",
    ", one can add a gate voltage @xmath12 and a gate capacitance @xmath13 .",
    "we focus on the strong coulomb blockade regime , assuming that the number of electrons which can be added to the dot is restricted to one .",
    "the physical features revealed in the corresponding bias window can be easily extended to a full span of many coulomb blockade peaks , as well a several orbital levels as in refs . .",
    "the extra - charge electron state is locally coupled to a phonon mode : in refs .",
    "this mode is identified with the radial breathing mode ( rbm ) of the carbon nanotube @xcite and , in ref .",
    ", with the longitudinal stretching mode . in view of the phonon - assisted tunneling processes",
    ", the above - mentioned coulomb blockade regime implies that the charging energy of the dot is assumed to be infinitely large compared to the relevant energy scale determined ( at low temperature ) by the phonon energy @xmath14 and the bias voltage . in the absence of phonons ,",
    "electron transport would occur only through a single electron state on the dot .    in the coulomb blockade regime ,",
    "far from the kondo regime , spin degrees of freedom are neglected .",

    "explicitly , we assume an exponential @xmath31-dependence : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the zero - point rbm oscillations to the electronic tunneling length ( @xmath34 ) which characterizes the tunnel barrier between the stm tip and the nanotube .",
    "such position dependent amplitudes have been introduced in the context of nano - mechanical electronic devices@xcite , where one refers to the `` shuttle '' mechanism as the central region oscillates between the two electrodes . on the other hand , in our situation",
    "the tube - substrate tunneling matrix amplitude is @xmath31-independent : @xmath35 . for @xmath36 , we refer here to this position dependent tunneling hamiltonian as the `` half - shuttle '' mechanism , because only one of the tunneling amplitude ( left ) is modified by the position .    in the model hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , formally describing the phonon - assisted tunneling of otherwise noninteracting electrons , the charging effects are taken into account via the bias - voltage dependence of the position of the dot level ( @xmath21 ) with respect to the chemical potentials of the leads , @xmath37 .",

    ": when the nanotube vibrates , the tunneling distance between the nanotube wall and the stm tip oscillates accordingly , but the amplitude of this motion is believed to be rather small ( or the order of the zero point motion , which can be smaller than @xmath291 ) .    with these ingredients , the polaron transformation eliminates the electron charge coupling to the phonon on the dot , and transfers this coupling to the tunneling hamiltonian . at this point",

    "high enough for this rate equation is valid , but low enough that thermally activated tunneling from the phonon sideband can be neglected , analytical predictions were made for the current - voltage characteristics , thanks to our assumption of a highly asymmetrical molecule ",
    "lead configuration : the positive or negative differential conductance behavior depends both on the location of the bare polaron level and on the occupation of the associated phonon sidebands  above and below this level  which are included in the bias voltage window .",
    "turning to numerics , attention was first drawn to the role of the relative capacitances to the dot . if the molecule / nanotube is in better contact with the lead which evacuates the electrons ( the substrate ) , than with the one who injects electrons , it is plausible to believe that the capacitance of this junction will be larger than that of the injecting junction . in this case , no negative differential conductance is obtained .",
    "when increasing the bias voltage , the contribution of an increasing number of phonon sidebands leads to a standard staircase behavior in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "thermal effects tend to round off the first step . in the experiment of ref . , the use of several nanotube samples with different lengths allowed to vary the relative capacitance of the injecting and of the tunneling contact .",
    "this provided a motivation to study the so - called `` reversed capacitance '' case , which according to our analytical prediction could justify the presence of an negative differential behavior .",
    "this was indeed observed numerically , but it was emphasized that intermediate phonon couplings are needed to observe ndc : `` small '' electron - phonon coupling leads to barely noticeable ndc , while `` large '' electron - phonon coupling suppresses ndc altogether , thus the need to use non - perturbative techniques to study ndc .",
    "do these results disqualify the possibility of ndc if contacts where the capacitances between left and right are comparable ?",
    "the answer is no , although ndc could be more difficult to detect in this case .",
    "while the global shape of the current voltage characteristics displays the staircase structure typically attributed to pdc , the onset of each step is followed by a small spike , thus displaying ndc behavior .",
    "the amplitude of this peak can be optimized with phonon coupling . for slightly asymmetric capacitances , the same effects",
    "are observed , but the staircase structure is modified as it involves two distinct periodicities .    because background charges may shift the bare polaron level , and because of the possibility of using a voltage gate on the molecule / dot we also studied the possibility of ndc in this case .",
    "this suggests that when the level is shifted upwards , ndc is possible even when the capacitance of the injecting junction is small .    finally , we have proposed that a half - shuttle mechanism may play a role in a stm experiment .",
    "it can be detected by the asymmetry of the current - voltage curves . yet , in our opinion , this mechanism can not account for ndc alone and only tends to increase the heights of pdc and ndc steps in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "notice that approaching the tip closer to the molecule should strongly enhance the half - shuttle mechanism . in our numerical calculations , we set @xmath292 assuming the amplitude of the zero - point rbm oscillations to be of the order of @xmath261pm .",

    "overall , we have provided a rather complete account on the possible occurrence of ndc behavior in molecular electronic transport , due to phonon - assisted transport .",
    "this phenomenon is due to a distribution of the total spectral weight of the injected electron on the polaron levels included in the bias window .",
    "taking into account the correct microscopic expressions of the franck - condon factors associated to phonon transitions , we have demonstrated that ndc effects are a fingerprint of the polaronic nature of charge carriers .",
    "while we can not rule out that ndc could exist in molecular system with symmetric molecular junction , it was not observed within this model . on the other hand ,",
    "we have clearly shown that for asymmetric tunneling rates , there exist a wide range of parameters which lead to ndc .    a striking result of this work is the fact that a simple counting of the ndc steps in the current voltage characteristic ( or alternatively , a counting of the peaks in differential conductance ) provides direct information about how many phonon subbands contribute to transport .",
    "the question remains about whether this ndc behavior can be observed in experiments .",
    "our model could apply to ref .",
    ", if the tunnel couplings are indeed asymmetric . concerning ref .",
    ", ndc occurs but only for the first phonon sideband .",
    "this can be due to several factors : first , as a general rule , the height of pdc or ndc steps tends to decrease with increasing phonon sidebands number .",
    "furthermore , if the electron phonon coupling is weak , ndc is present but its manifestation is weak .",
    "finite temperature tends to smear these steps , so in order to observe several peaks in ndc , lower temperatures would be required , keeping in mind that the tunneling contacts should not be too large in order to `` avoid '' any kondo like regime .",
    "another aspect which we have not considered in this work is the possibility of phonon damping .",
    "the population of the phonon subbands may rearrange due to the coupling with the environment of the molecule @xcite .",
    "the environment could include electron - hole pairs generated in the leads , which should be reduced because of our weak coupling assumption . on the other hand , for a `` large '' molecular system",
    ", the optical phonon mode ( the breathing mode of the nanotube of ref . ) is also accompanied by other phonon modes such as acoustic - like modes , which have typically lower energies , and which therefore can play the role of a `` bath '' . because of the importance of the occupation of the phonon subbands for ndc in our present work",

    "<S> transport through a single molecular conductor is considered , showing negative differential conductance behavior associated with phonon - mediated electron tunneling processes . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical work is motivated by a recent experiment by leroy et al . </S>",
    "<S> using a carbon nanotube contacted by an stm tip [ nature * 432 * , 371 ( 2004 ) ] , where negative differential conductance of the breathing mode phonon side peaks could be observed . </S>",
    "<S> a peculiarity of this system is that the tunneling couplings which inject electrons and those which collect them on the substrate are highly asymmetrical . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum dot model is used , coupling a single electronic level to a local phonon , forming polaron levels . </S>",
    "<S> a `` half - shuttle '' mechanism is also introduced . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum kinetic formulation allows to derive rate equations . </S>",
    "<S> assuming asymmetric tunneling rates , and in the absence of the half - shuttle coupling , negative differential conductance is obtained for a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed explanation of this phenomenon is provided , showing that ndc is maximal for intermediate electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in absence of a gate , the `` floating '' level results in two distinct lengths for the current plateaus , related to the capacitive couplings at the two junctions . it is shown that the `` half - shuttle '' mechanism tends to reinforce the negative differential regions , but it can not trigger this behavior on its own . </S>"
