    "it has long been recognised that the triggering of gravitational collapse by shocks could be important in star formation . for example",
    ", @xcite showed that the dense layer between the shock and an ionisation front can be gravitationally unstable and @xcite suggested that a supernova - induced birth of the solar system could account for the presence of short - lived radioisotopes ( slri ) in meteorites .",
    "there is also considerable observational evidence for star formation triggered by supernovae , ionisation fronts , protostellar outflows and other shocks in the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there have been a considerable number of simulations of shocks interacting with gravitationally bound clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these do , indeed , show that shock waves can trigger gravitational collapse , as long as the radiative cooling time is sufficiently short .    in a previous paper @xcite , we considered the interaction of isothermal , plane parallel shocks with magnetically sub - critical clouds .",
    "although gravitational collapse can not occur in such clouds in the absence of ambi - polar diffusion , we found that shocks with alfvnic mach numbers of 2 could produce a temporary increase in the density by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to a combination of shock focusing and mhd effects rather than gravitational collapse .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the purely hydrodynamic version of this problem , that of an isothermal shock interacting with an isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "this is exactly the same as that considered by @xcite , but they only considered a small number of cases , whereas our purpose is to derive a simple expression for the shock strength required to induce gravitational collapse .",
    "the astrophysical application that we have in mind is that of the dense , quasi - stationary cores found in star - forming regions , which in many cases appear to be close to bonnor - ebert spheres ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these are presumably gravitationally stable , but their collapse could be triggered by shocks due to stellar winds and jets , ionisation fronts and supernovae .",
    "we will also briefly consider the effect of self - gravity on kelvin - helmholtz and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities since these may be important for cloud destruction and mixing of slris into gas that will form a protoplanetary system ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "section [ numtech ] describes the numerical method and initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the general evolution of the clouds is discussed in section [ shocks ] and a comparison of the development of non - gravitational instabilities in models with and without self - gravity is presented in section [ instab ] .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "the calculations were performed with the hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code mg @xcite .",
    "this solves the equations of hydrodynamics using a second order upwind scheme described in @xcite .",
    "a hierarchy of @xmath1 grids levels , @xmath2 , is used , and the mesh spacing for @xmath3 is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cell size for the coarsest level , @xmath6 . @xmath6 and @xmath7 cover the entire domain , but finer grids need not do so .",
    "refinement is on a cell - by - cell basis and is controlled by error estimates based on the difference between solutions on different grids , i. e. the difference between the solutions on @xmath8 and @xmath3 determine refinement to @xmath9 .",
    "self - gravity is computed using a full approximation multigrid to solve the poisson equation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the problem is axisymmetric , the calculations were performed on a three - dimensional cartesian grid .",
    "this saves us the trouble of writing an axisymmetric poisson solver and has the merit that it allows for non - axisymmetric instabilities that are sufficiently strong to be triggered by rounding error .",
    "the domain is @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with the centre of the cloud initially at the origin .",
    "initially @xmath13 grids were used with a resolution of @xmath0 on @xmath6 , which gives an effective maximum resolution of @xmath14 . note that @xmath6 needs to be coarse in order to ensure fast convergence of the multigrid poisson solver . this resolution is more than adequate for the equilibrium state , but is not sufficient to resolve the high density region that is produced by the shock interaction .",
    "however , the code has the ability to resolve such regions by increasing the number of refinement levels during the course of the calculation ( see table [ table1 ] for the effective resolution in each run ) .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that , in calculations involving gravitational collapse , one needs to resolve the jeans length    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the sound speed and @xmath17 is the density .",
    "they suggest that the mesh spacing needs to be @xmath18 to avoid artificial fragmentation when a dense region moves from a fine to a coarse grid .",
    "this is not a situation that occurs in these calculations , but it is nevertheless useful to compare the mesh spacing with @xmath19 .    the highest density and hence the smallest jeans length in a non - collapsing case occurs in the state 1 @xmath20 calculation and this gives @xmath21 .",
    "the mesh spacing in this case is @xmath22 , so the jeans length is comfortably resolved .",
    "it is even better resolved in the other non - collapsing cases . in the collapsing cases the calculation is stopped before the jeans length becomes unresolved , by which time it is clear that the collapse is unstoppable .",
    "we first compute the collapse of an initially uniform , non - rotating , isothermal , spherical cloud to a stable hydrostatic equilibrium state .",
    "the cloud has a sound speed @xmath23 and is embedded in a warmer uniform medium with sound speed @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 .",
    "the cloud material is tracked with an advected scalar @xmath26 that is unity in the cloud and zero in the surroundings .",
    "the sound speed , @xmath16 , is given by    @xmath27    the scalar is also used to turn off gravity in the external medium .",
    "we use units in which @xmath28 , the gravitation constant @xmath29 and the mass of the cloud @xmath30 . in these units ,",
    "the maximum external pressure that can be supported by a stable bonner - ebert sphere is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we consider four stable states with external pressures @xmath32 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "these states were generated by starting with a uniform density cloud with @xmath33 .",
    "the initial radius is then fixed by the requirement that the mass of the cloud is unity .",
    "this initial state was then allowed to collapse until it reached equilibrium . as noted by @xcite , a cloud formed in this way oscillates about the bonnor - ebert state for some time .",
    "this was prevented by imposing a drag force of the form    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a suitable coefficient and @xmath36 is the velocity .",
    "the drag force is switched off once the cloud has become static .",
    "once an equilibrium bonner - ebert sphere has been obtained , a planar isothermal shock with mach number @xmath37 moving in the negative @xmath38 direction is introduced near the cloud .",
    "the density and velocity at @xmath39 are fixed at the values given by the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for a shock with isothermal mach number @xmath37 propagating into the medium surrounding the cloud .",
    "we considered a number of different cases with different external pressures and sound speeds as summarised in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the only dimensionless parameters are the incident shock mach number , @xmath37 , the ratio of the initial external pressure , @xmath25 , to the maximum pressure of a stable bonnor - ebert sphere , @xmath40 and the ratio of the sound speeds , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the case considered by @xcite ,",
    "the cloud had a mass of @xmath41 m@xmath42 , a temperature of @xmath43 k , and a radius of @xmath44 pc in an external medium at @xmath45 k. this gives the same ratio of sound speeds as in our state 1 ( see table see table [ table1 ] ) , but their initial external pressure was @xmath46 , so that their cloud was closer to collapse than any of our cases .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that they find that a shock with a mach number of @xmath47 induces collapse .",
    "one could also apply our results to other cases , such as bok globules with masses in the range @xmath43 ",
    "@xmath48 m@xmath42 , which are known to be associated with young stars @xcite .",
    "it is useful to define an incident shock crossing time by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the radius of the equilibrium cloud , which is the timescale on which the flow outside the cloud becomes quasi - steady .",
    "the other relevant timescale is an estimate of the time it takes for the transmitted shock in the cloud to reach the centre , which @xcite call the `` cloud crushing time '' .",
    "they use    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the ( uniform ) density of the cloud . @xcite",
    "set @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the central density .",
    "we shall see later that this is not always a good estimate of the time at which the maximum density in the cloud begins to increase .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the density and velocity vectors in the @xmath55 plane at different times for state 1 , @xmath56 simulation . in the top left hand panel ( @xmath57 )",
    "the incident shock has passed the cloud , formed a quasi - steady bow shock and is driving a transmitted shock into the cloud . in the middle left panel ( @xmath58 )",
    "the transmitted shock has reached the centre of the cloud in the cloud and created a high density region .",
    "the middle right panel is at the time at which the density is maximum ( @xmath59 ) and in the bottom left panel ( @xmath60 ) the cloud is re - expanding .",
    "the bottom right panel ( @xmath61 ) shows a blow - up of the expanding cloud with velocity arrows in the rest frame of the densest region .",
    "the convergence of the transmitted shock at the centre is shown in more detail in figure  [ fig2 ] . here",
    "we can see that a jet is produced in much the same way as in a shaped charge @xcite .",
    "this jet interacts with other parts of the cloud to produce a secondary high density region ( bottom left panel ) .",
    "the maximum density is much larger than that behind the initial transmitted shock : it is clear that flow convergence has a significant effect there are some similarities with the magnetic case described in @xcite , but the latter is more complicated due to the dynamic effects of the magnetic field .",
    "however , despite the high density , there is no collapse in this case because the high density region is too small to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows what happens for state 1 in the @xmath62 case , which does collapse .",
    "the flow evolves in much the same way , except that the high density region collapses in this case .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows that the mach number of a shock that induces collapse does not decrease by much when the external sound speed is reduced to @xmath63 ( state 2 ) and in fact the flow is very similar to that for state 1 .",
    "this is not too surprising since in both cases the density contrast is large enough for the evolution of the flow around the cloud to be quasi - steady .",
    "the values of the maximum density obtained for different simulations are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one can see from figure  [ fig7 ] that the cloud bounces even in those cases in which it subsequently undergoes collapse",
    ".    it would obviously be useful to have a rule of thumb to determine the strength of the shock required for collapse .",
    "consider a plane isothermal shock with speed @xmath64 in a medium at rest with sound speed @xmath16 , density @xmath65 and pressure @xmath66 .",
    "the density and velocity behind the shock are    @xmath67    and    @xmath68    the pressure is therefore    @xmath69    the most obvious estimate of the critical mach number for collapse is to set @xmath70 , the maximum external pressure that the cloud can support , which gives the mach number @xmath71 shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one can see that this works quite well for the cases with the larger initial external pressure ( states 4 and 5 ) but is an overestimate for the lower initial pressues ( states 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "one might suppose that this is because shock convergence induces larger pressures than that behind the incident shock",
    ".    however , as we have already pointed out , the evolution of the flow around the cloud to approximately quasi - steady , so the relevant pressure should really be that in a steady flow around the cloud .",
    "in such a flow , the maximum pressure is that behind a stationary shock whose upstream state is that behind the incident shock , i.e @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the post - shock density and pressure",
    "are therefore    @xmath74    @xmath75    setting @xmath76 gives the mach number @xmath77 shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "this works very well for state 3 , and is somewhat better than @xmath71 for states 1 and 2 .",
    "note that @xmath77 is not defined for states 4 and 5 since it would imply a subsonic flow behind the incident shock .",
    "in fact the state 4 and 5 simulations are somewhat dubious since the flow is subsonic behind the weakest incident shock that induces collapse , which is incompatible with our imposition of the post - shock state at the right x boundary .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath77 significantly underestimates the mach number required for collapse for states 1 and 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] tells us that for state 1 , only a fairly small part of the surface of the cloud experiences a pressure greater than @xmath40 and the same is true for state 2 .",
    "clearly shock convergence helps , but it does not produce a large enough high density region for collapse unless the incident mach number is somewhat higher than @xmath77 .",
    "one can see from figure  [ fig5 ] that almost the whole of the surface of the cloud experiences a pressure greater than @xmath40 in the subsonic flow behind the incident shock for state 5 and this is also true for state 4 .",
    "this is why @xmath71 is a good estimate for these cases .",
    "however , as we have already pointed out the calculations are not entirely trustworthy for these cases and even if they were , clouds so close to collapse are not of much interest .",
    "note that neither @xmath71 nor @xmath77 depend on the initial density ratio between the cloud and its surroundings , @xmath78 , since @xmath71 simply depends on the pressure behind the incident shock and @xmath77 on the pressure behind a quasi - steady bow shock .",
    "the critical value of @xmath37 for collapse is also insensitive to the density ratio : it is very nearly the same for states 1 and 2 .",
    "this is because the density ratio is large enough for the `` cloud crushing time '' given by equation ( [ tcrush1 ] ) to be significantly larger than the shock crossing time , given by equation ( [ tcross ] ) .",
    "the flow outside the cloud is therefore approximately quasi - steady by the time the transmitted shock reaches the centre of the cloud .",
    "we can see that this is true from figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] : the cloud density does not begin to increase signicantly until @xmath79 for state and 1 @xmath80 for state 2 . note that the `` cloud crushing time '' defined by equation ( [ tcrush1 ] ) gives a reasonable estimate of this time : @xmath81 for state 1 and @xmath82 for state 2 .",
    "however , the estimate is not so good for state 5 , for which @xmath83 , while the density begins to increase rapidly at @xmath84 .",
    "this is largely because this cloud is more centrally condensed , so that the speed of the transmitted shock in the outer parts of the cloud is larger than that used to estimate @xmath85     for the state 1 @xmath86 calculation at @xmath87 .",
    "the boundary of the cloud is the black contour . ]",
    "there has recently been considerable work on the possibility that the short lived radio isotopes found in meteorites could have been injected into the solar nebular by instabilities during an interaction with a supernova shell ( e.g. @xcite ) . although it is not the main focus of the paper , it is worth looking at any instabilities that might occur .",
    "one might expect self - gravity to have a stabilising effect on instabilities at the cloud surface since it is rayleigh - taylor stable .",
    "the simulations described in the previous section do indeed show little evidence of either kelvin - helmholtz or richtmyer - meshkov instabilities at the cloud surface , but there is a weak non - axisymmetric kelvin - helmholtz instability in the wake .",
    "however , a stronger incident shock does induce richtmyer - meshkov instabilities on the front surface of cloud .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the density in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 planes for a state 1 , @xmath90 simulation at a time at which the incident shock has just passed the cloud .",
    "a non - axisymmetric richtmyer - meshkov instability is clearly present and has not been suppressed by self - gravity .",
    "one can see from figure [ fig9 ] , which shows the cloud scalar , that the instability does lead to some mixing behind the shock in the cloud",
    ". however , this shock simply shreds the cloud without causing gravitational collapse .",
    "this is consistent with the results in @xcite : if the shock is too weak there is very little instability , whereas if it is too strong it destroys the cloud .",
    "plane ( top ) and @xmath89 plane ( bottom ) for the state 1 , @xmath91 simulation at @xmath92 . ]",
    "plane ( top ) and @xmath93 plane ( bottom ) for the state 1 , @xmath91 simulation at @xmath94 . ]",
    "we have found that the minimum mach number , @xmath37 , of a shock that induces collapse in a previously stable self - gravitating cloud is not sensitive to the initial density ratio between the cloud and its surroundings , as long as it is sufficiently large .",
    "the mininum value of @xmath37 lies between @xmath77 and @xmath71 where for @xmath95 the pressure behind the incident shock is equal to the maximum pressure , @xmath40 , that cloud can sustain , whereas for @xmath96 the maximum pressure behind the bow shock is equal @xmath40 .",
    "a shock with a smaller value of @xmath37 will compress a cloud until a peak density is reached , after which the cloud expands , but gravity prevents it from being disrupted .",
    "such an expansion phase can occur even if @xmath37 is large enough for collapse , but in such cases gravity eventually drives collapse .    as in our simulations of shock interactions with magnetically subcritical clouds @xcite , the simulations described above show that shock focussing is responsible for the large value of the peak density that is reached even in clouds that do not collapse .",
