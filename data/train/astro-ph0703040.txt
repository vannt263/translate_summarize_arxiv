    "in recent years the statistical analysis of galaxy redshift surveys has become a thriving industry in cosmology , yielding powerful constraints on the parameters of both the underlying cosmological world model and on the luminosity distribution of galaxies as a function of redshift , environment and morphological type .",
    "however , both tasks are rendered complicated by the presence of observational selection effects  due to e.g. detection thresholds in apparent magnitude , colour , surface brightness or some combination thereof . over many years , therefore , a wide range of statistical tools has been developed to identify , characterise  and hopefully to remove  the impact of observational selection effects from magnitude - redshift surveys .    of particular interest are data - sets which are complete in apparent magnitude  meaning that all galaxies brighter than some specified limiting apparent magnitude ( or , as is pertinent to this paper , with apparent magnitudes lying between some specified bright and faint limiting values ) have been observed . the case of magnitude - redshift data truncated by a faint apparent magnitude limit has been extensively discussed in the literature and well - established techniques have been developed for reconstructing the galaxy luminosity function in this case .",
    "these include , for example , the @xmath7 method of @xcite , the maximum likelihood fitting method of @xcite and the stepwise maximum likelihood method of @xcite .",
    "however , these methods are formulated under the assumption that the survey data are complete in apparent magnitude ; hence , the assumption of magnitude completeness must be rigourously checked .",
    "a classical test for completeness in apparent magnitude is to analyse the variation in galaxy number counts as a function of the adopted limiting apparent magnitude ( hubble 1926 ) .",
    "this test , which presupposes that the galaxy population does not evolve with time and is homogeneously distributed in space , is however not very efficient .",
    "more specifically , it is difficult to decide in practice whether deviations from the expected galaxy number count is indeed an effect of incompleteness in apparent magnitude , or is due to galaxy clustering and/or evolution of the galaxy luminosity function , or is indeed created by incompleteness in apparent magnitude .",
    "of course in designing a completeness test one can also make use of distance information via galaxy redshifts ; the well - known @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test of @xcite does this , and considers  for a specified magnitude limit ",
    "the ratio of two volumes : the volume of a sphere of radius equal to the actual distance of observed galaxy , divided by the volume of a sphere of radius equal to the _ maximum _ distance at which the galaxy would be observable ",
    "i.e. at the apparent magnitude limit .",
    "it follows that  for a non - evolving , homogeneous distribution of galaxies  the expected value of @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 is equal to @xmath8 . the @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test has been used to assess the completeness of magnitude - redshift samples ( see for example @xcite , but unfortunately it suffers from the same major drawbacks as the hubble test based on galaxy number counts : it is difficult to interpret whether any significant measured departure from the expected value of @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 is due to incompleteness or to clustering and evolutionary effects .    in an important (",
    "although rarely cited ) paper , @xcite introduced a powerful new approach to analysing magnitude - redshift surveys .",
    "they proposed a non - parametric test for the independence of the spatial and luminosity distributions of galaxies in a magnitude - limited sample , which required no assumptions concerning the parametric form of both the spatial distribution and the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "they applied this test to a quasar sample , with an assumed apparent magnitude limit , in order to robustly estimate the cosmological parameters characterising the luminosity distance - redshift relation of the quasars ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the essential ideas of efron & petrosian could be straightforwardly adapted and extended to turn their non - parametric test of the cosmological model into a non - parametric test of the assumption of a magnitude - limited sample  thus developing a simple but powerful tool for assessing the magnitude completeness of magnitude - redshift surveys .",
    "as was the case with efron & petrosian  and unlike the hubble number counts or @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 tests  the rauzy test statistic requires no assumption that the spatial distribution of galaxies is homogenous .",
    "moreover , it also requires no knowledge of the parametric form of the galaxy luminosity function . on the other hand ,",
    "the rauzy test was formulated only for the case of a sharp , faint apparent magnitude limit .",
    "the aim of this paper will be to extend rauzy s formalism to account for a bright apparent magnitude limit , and to apply the extended completeness test to several recent galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "this paper is , therefore , organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the completeness test introduced by @xcite and extend it to the case of a galaxy survey with both a faint and a bright apparent magnitude limit . in section 3",
    "we then introduce a further variant on the original rauzy completeness test , which is based on the cumulative distance distribution of observable galaxies in a magnitude - redshift survey . in section 4",
    "we briefly describe the properties of three recent redshift surveys : the millennium galaxy catalogue , the sloan digital sky survey and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey . in section 5",
    "we then apply our new completeness test to these three surveys , investigating their completeness in apparent magnitude .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarise our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review briefly the robust completeness test introduced by rauzy ( 2001 ; hereafter r01 ) and applied in @xcite , and extend it to include the effect of an imposed bright apparent magnitude limit to a magnitude - redshift survey . while this extension is straightforward , our approach in this paper will be rather pedagogical in order to benefit those readers not previously familiar with the formalism previously developed in r01 and rauzy , hendry & dmellow ( 2001 ) .",
    "the fundamental assumption of the rauzy completeness test is that the luminosity function of the galaxy population does not depend on the 3-d redshift space position @xmath9 of the galaxies .",
    "although this assumption is restrictive , note that it is common to most classical number counts tests of completeness and indeed ( when applied in the context of assessing magnitude completeness ) the @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test .",
    "moreover , the results derived in appendix 1 of rauzy , hendry & dmellow ( 2001 ) imply that the completeness test of r01 remains valid in the case of pure density evolution . note also that the completeness test remains valid for the case of pure luminosity evolution provided that an evolution correction is applied to account for the ( assumed known ) functional dependence of the mean luminosity at given redshift . for clarity , we will defer until a subsequent paper the interesting case where one wishes _ simultaneously _ to assess the magnitude completeness _ and _ estimate the parameters of a luminosity evolution model . in this paper , where appropriate , we will apply evolutionary and extinction corrections from the literature to the photometry of the galaxy surveys we consider . specifically , following the notation of r01 , we introduce the corrected distance modulus @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ( cosmological model - dependent ) distance modulus at redshift @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16-corrections and evolutionary corrections respectively and @xmath17 is an extinction correction dependent on galactic co - ordinates @xmath18 . note , however , as will be seen in section 5 below , that the application ( or not ) of @xmath16-corrections and evolutionary corrections generally does not have a strong impact on the performance of our completeness test . neglecting for the moment any observational selection effects",
    ", the joint probability density in position and absolute magnitude for the galaxy population can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the 3d redshift space distribution function of the sources along the past light - cone and @xmath21 is the galaxy luminosity function , defined following e.g. .",
    "we now take as our null hypothesis that the selection effects are separable in position and apparent magnitude , and that the observed sample is complete in apparent magnitude for those objects which are simultaneously brighter than a specified faint apparent magnitude limit , @xmath22 , and fainter than a specified bright apparent magnitude limit , @xmath23 . under this null hypothesis",
    "the selection function @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heaviside or ` step ' function defined as @xmath27 and @xmath28 describes the selection effects in angular position and observed redshift .",
    "taking into account this model for the selection effects , the probability density function describing the joint distribution of absolute magnitude @xmath29 and corrected distance modulus @xmath10 for the observable galaxy population may therefore be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability density function of @xmath10 for observable galaxies , marginalised over direction on the sky , i.e. @xmath32 and the integrand @xmath33 is equal to the ( suitably normalised ) product of the 3-d redshift space density @xmath34 and the selection function @xmath28 , re - expressed as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "note from equation ( [ dp_2 ] ) that the faint and bright apparent magnitude limits introduce a correlation between the variables @xmath29 and @xmath10 for observable galaxies .      as in r01 ,",
    "the key element of our extended completeness test is the definition of a random variable , @xmath35 , related to the cumulative luminosity function of the galaxy population .",
    "we proceed in a similar manner to r01 , but now with both a bright and faint apparent magnitude limit . to see how we construct @xmath35 in this more general case consider fig .  1 , which schematically represents an @xmath36 plot of corrected distance modulus versus absolute magnitude for the observable population of galaxies .",
    "the left hand panel shows this plot for the case of a faint apparent magnitude limit only , as was considered in r01 .",
    "the right hand panel is for the more general case which we consider here . shown on the right hand panel",
    "are solid diagonal lines representing the ` true ' faint and bright apparent magnitude limits , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , while the bold diagonal lines represent putative faint and bright magnitude limits , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the position @xmath41 of the @xmath42 galaxy is also indicated on both panels , and the schematic diagrams are superimposed on the actual @xmath36 distribution for the millennium galaxy catalogue ( driver et al .",
    "2005 ; see below ) .    in graphical terms , the essential idea of our completeness test is to identify from the data the faintest value of @xmath39 and the brightest value of @xmath40 which together bound a _ rectangular _ region of the @xmath36 plane , within which the joint distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath10 for observable galaxies is separable .",
    "if we compare the left and right hand panels of fig .  1 , we can see that the addition of a bright magnitude limit has an important impact on the construction of this separable region : in short , the region is no longer unique .",
    "however , if we fix the width , @xmath43 , in corrected distance modulus as shown in the right hand panel of fig .  1 , the corresponding separable region",
    "_ is _ now uniquely defined .",
    "moreover we can then define for the @xmath44 galaxy the following absolute magnitudes :    * @xmath45 , the absolute magnitude of a galaxy , at corrected distance modulus @xmath46 , which would be observed at the true faint apparent magnitude limit @xmath47 , * @xmath48 , the absolute magnitude of a galaxy , at corrected distance modulus @xmath49 , which would be observed at the true bright apparent magnitude limit @xmath50 .",
    "these two absolute magnitudes are indicated , for the _ putative _ magnitude limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 , by the vertical dashed lines in the right hand panel of fig .  1 .",
    "we now define the random variable @xmath35 as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cumulative luminosity function , i.e. @xmath53    it is straightforward to show from this definition that the random variable @xmath35 has a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath54 $ ] , and furthermore that @xmath35 and @xmath10 are statistically independent .",
    "thus @xmath35 shares the same two defining properties as the corresponding random variable defined in r01 .",
    "equation ( [ zeta ] ) therefore generalises the definition of @xmath35 to the case of a galaxy survey with bright and faint magnitude limits .",
    "the relevance of @xmath35 as a diagnostic of magnitude completeness will be demonstrated in the next two sections .      as was the case in r01",
    ", the random variable @xmath35 has the very useful property that we can estimate it without any prior knowledge of the cumulative luminosity function @xmath52 . given a value of @xmath43 , it is clear from fig .  1 that for each point",
    "@xmath55 in the @xmath36 plane we can define the regions @xmath56 and @xmath57 as follows :    * @xmath58    * @xmath59    in the special case where there is no bright limit the regions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are as shown in the left hand panel of fig .  1 .    clearly the random variables @xmath29 and @xmath10 are now independent within each sub - sample @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore from equation ( [ dp_2 ] ) the number of points @xmath60 belonging to @xmath56 satisfies @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total number of galaxies in the sample .",
    "similarly the number of points @xmath63 in @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 the integrals over absolute magnitude in equations ( [ r_i ] ) and ( [ n_i ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath66 and @xmath67 thus , given a pair of ` trial ' magnitude limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 , it follows from equations ( [ zeta ] ) and ( [ r_i ] ) to ( [ eq : int2 ] ) that an estimate of @xmath35 for the @xmath44 galaxy is simply the ratio of the number of galaxies belonging to @xmath56 and @xmath68 respectively ( where @xmath69 and @xmath70 replace @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the definition of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . in fact an unbiased estimate of @xmath35 for the @xmath44 galaxy is ( c.f .",
    "r01 ) @xmath73 this estimator is identical to that defined in r01 ; the introduction of a bright magnitude limit has simply changed the definition of the random variable @xmath35 itself and the membership criteria of the two regions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "thus , provided that both @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then under our null hypothesis @xmath76 will be uniformly distributed on @xmath54 $ ] and uncorrelated with @xmath46 , exactly as was the case in r01 .",
    "moreover the expectation value @xmath77 and the variance @xmath78 of the @xmath79 are given respectively by @xmath80 =   \\frac{1}{12 } \\ , \\frac{n_i-1}{n_i+1}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath78 tends towards the variance of a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 1 when @xmath63 is large .",
    "as in r01 , we can , therefore , combine the estimator @xmath76 for each observed galaxy into a single statistic , @xmath0 , which we can use to test the magnitude completeness of our sample for adopted trial magnitude limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath0 is defined as @xmath81 if the sample is complete in apparent magnitude , for a given pair of trial magnitude limits , then @xmath0 should be normally distributed with mean zero and variance unity . if , on the other hand , the trial faint ( bright ) magnitude limit is fainter ( brighter ) than the true limit , @xmath0 will become systematically negative , due to the systematic departure of the @xmath79 distribution from uniform on the interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "in section 1 we remarked on the similarities between the @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test statistic and the completeness test of r01 .",
    "we now introduce a further variant on the test statistic @xmath0 , related to the distribution of corrected distance modulus for observable galaxies in a magnitude - redshift survey .",
    "[ fig : mz2 ] shows schematic @xmath36 plots , analogous to fig .  1 : the left panel again has a faint apparent magnitude limit only while the right hand has a ` true ' bright and faint apparent magnitude limit , @xmath50 and @xmath83 , with ` putative ' bright and faint limits , @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively , shown as the bold diagonal lines .",
    "again , the position , @xmath86 , of a typical galaxy is shown on each panel , and the schematic plots are superimposed on the actual @xmath36 distribution of the millennium catalogue .    in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mz2 ] , however , we consider a ` slice ' of width @xmath87 in absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath88 , as shown .",
    "we see that , given @xmath89 , @xmath47 and @xmath87 , we can define for the @xmath44 galaxy the following corrected distance moduli :    * @xmath90 , the corrected distance modulus of a galaxy , with absolute magnitude @xmath88 , which would be observed at the true faint apparent magnitude limit @xmath47 , * @xmath91 , the corrected distance modulus of a galaxy , with absolute magnitude @xmath92 , which would be observed at the true bright apparent magnitude limit @xmath50 .",
    "these two limiting distance moduli are indicated , for the _ putative _ magnitude limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 , by the horizontal dashed lines in fig .",

    "the most likely explanation for this feature seems to lie in the way the dataset is selected and corrected .",
    "the raw dataset , with uncorrected magnitudes , has the same magnitude limit imposed on all galaxies independent of their galaxy type .",

    "it is evident from this plot that , even with a bright magnitude limit as faint as @xmath148 , the performance of the @xmath0 statistic at fainter magnitudes is largely unaffected , showing consistent behaviour for _ all _ the bright limits considered .",
    "as previously discussed , the sdss data - set has both a published bright and faint apparent magnitude limit of @xmath149 and @xmath5 mag . respectively .",
    "we , therefore , tested the completeness of the dr1 early type galaxies using our generalised @xmath0 statistic which accounts for both a faint and bright limit .",
    "as an illustration , we chose to fix the bright limit of the sdss data - set to be equal to the published value , and computed the @xmath0 statistic as a function of the trial faint magnitude limit .",
    "we could , alternatively , have fixed the value of _ faint _ magnitude limit and computed the value of @xmath0 for different trial values of the bright limit , or indeed we could have treated simultaneously both the faint and bright limits as free parameters . however , the case we present is sufficient to illustrate our method .",
    "[ fig : sdsstc ]  ( left ) shows the resulting @xmath0 curve .",
    "we see that our results are in agreement with the published faint magnitude limit ",
    "i.e. the behaviour of @xmath0 is consistent with magnitude completeness up to and including a sharp , faint limit of @xmath5 mag .",
    ", followed immediately by the strongly negative behaviour expected for an incomplete sample at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdsstc ] shows the @xmath0 curve computed using the traditional rauzy method with a faint limit only . here",
    "the results show a similar trend to that seen for the mgc data - set with an artificially imposed bright limit section , and further underlines to importance of correctly accounting for a bright _ and _ faint limit when both are present in the data . in a future paper",
    "we will explore in more detail the completeness of not only the current sdss data releases , but also how that completeness varies with bandpass .",
    "we move finally to the 2dfgrs survey which , as discussed in the data section , has a published faint limit of @xmath150 mag .",
    "our initial approach was to apply the traditional @xmath0 statistic to the 2dfgrs since the published literature on the survey gives no indication about the presence of a secondary bright limit .",
    "[ fig:2df ]  ( left ) shows the behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of trial magnitude limit , @xmath151 , for five different cases .",
    "the solid red curve represents the completeness test with with no @xmath16- or @xmath152-corrections applied .",
    "the remaining four curves show @xmath0 with various @xmath140- corrections applied to the 2dfgrs data - set , as shown in the figure key .",
    "consider firstly the uncorrected data - set ( solid red curve ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath153 mag .",
    "the @xmath0 statistic appears to behave as we would expect for a complete sample ( although of course this is at the cost of ` throwing away ' most of the galaxies in the survey by imposing such a low value for the faint limit ) .",
    "however , for higher values of @xmath151 the statistic drops dramatically to a minimum value of nearly @xmath154 below its expectation value of zero at @xmath155 mag .",
    "as we continue to increase @xmath151 , @xmath0 rises sharply to reach a peak at @xmath156 mag , beyond which the statistic drops dramatically again , exceeding @xmath141 below its expected value at @xmath157 ",
    "i.e. significantly brighter than the published magnitude limit of @xmath158 mag .",
    "could the behaviour of @xmath0 be related to the fact that we have used an uncorrected data - set ? to address this question consider now the remaining four curves ; the dotted and short dashed curves correspond to the @xcite and @xcite global @xmath140-corrections respectively , whereas the long dashed and solid black curves correspond to the type - dependent @xmath140-corrections of @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the adoption of any of these corrections has very little effect on the completeness statistic compared with the uncorrected case . indeed",
    ", if anything , the addition of @xmath140-corrections appears to yield a @xmath0 statistic which is more strongly inconsistent with a complete sample .",
    "this latter effect may be explicable in the same manner as for the corrected mgc magnitudes described in section [ sec : mgc ] , although it should be noted that the type - dependent @xmath140-corrections do not appear to perform significantly better than their global counterparts .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath0 differs from zero at many standard deviations over a wide range of trial faint magnitude limits is clear evidence that the distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath10 for observable galaxies is _ not _ separable with these faint limits .",
    "the physical cause for this is not immediately clear ; however , having demonstrated in the previous subsection the adverse impact on @xmath0 of not correctly accounting for a bright magnitude limit , we next apply our generalised test statistic to the 2dfgrs data - set .      in the absence of a clear indication from the literature of what is an appropriate bright magnitude limit",
    ", we adopted the brightest galaxy in our subset ( see  [ sec:2dfdata ] ) , @xmath159 mag . the right hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:2df ] shows the @xmath0 curve obtained for the 2dfgrs ( with no @xmath16- or @xmath152- corrections applied ) as a function of trial faint limit , @xmath151 , with @xmath160 mag .",
    "we have used a @xmath43 = 0.8 ( a small @xmath43 leads to low numbers of galaxies within the subsets , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , making our test statistic prone to large statistical fluctuations and therefore less sensitive to a sharp cut in magnitude ) .",
    "the plot demonstrates a dramatic change in behaviour of the 2df completeness , compared with the traditional @xmath0 statistic . by simply accounting for a bright limit  notwithstanding the fact that no published bright limit has been reported in the literature",
    " we find that the 2dfgrs data - set is indeed complete to the published faint magnitude limit with no evidence for residual systematics .",
    "in the previous sections we introduced and applied our improved @xmath0 statistic , which accounts for both a faint and bright magnitude limit in assessing the completeness of a magnitude - redshift survey . in this section",
    "we apply the @xmath1 statistic , introduced in section 3 above , to the same data - sets .",
    "our @xmath1 statistic can be thought of as an improved , differential , version of the classical @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test of galaxy evolution , which is generally presented in the literature as yielding a single number ",
    "the mean value of @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 averaged over all galaxies in the survey , adopting a given faint apparent magnitude limit and assuming that the underlying spatial distribution of galaxies is homogeneous .",
    "in contrast , we can compute @xmath1 as a function of an incrementally increasing @xmath163 ( and/or indeed , if we wished , an incrementally _ decreasing _ bright limit , @xmath89 ) and thus analyse our data - set via a series of progressively truncated subsets . crucially , moreover , like the @xmath0 test and unlike the @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 statistic , @xmath1 has the important property of being independent of the spatial distribution of galaxies within the survey .",
    "[ fig : mgc_tv ] shows a comparison of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 curves for all three surveys . the left hand plot is the mgc survey with @xmath164-corrections applied .",
    "the @xmath1 curve shows an almost identical match to the @xmath0 statistic .",
    "similar behaviour is evident with sdss - dr1 and 2dfgrs ( middle and right plots ) . that @xmath1 and @xmath0 give a consistent indication of the completeness of these surveys should not be too surprising , since we are confident ( at least once a bright limit is included in our analysis of 2dfgrs ) that all three are well calibrated and well understood .",
    "moreover , they are all relatively shallow in redshift range , which means that extinction and evolution corrections are not likely to impact too strongly on our assessment of their completeness ( a fact which is supported by our results for @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , one can ask under what conditions might the two statistics @xmath0 and @xmath1 diverge from each other ?    consider a galaxy , @xmath165 , characterised by its ` coordinates ' @xmath166 .",
    "we have two complementary ways of generating volume limited data - sets for such a pair :    * at fixed luminosity we can ask what redshift distribution will produce apparent magnitudes permitted by our selection criteria ? * alternatively , at fixed redshift we can ask what distribution of luminosities ( i.e. what part of the underlying galaxy luminosity function ) are we sampling , given our selection limits in apparent magnitude ?",
    "the former criterion resembles the procedure used to contruct the @xmath1 statistic , while the latter criterion is more closely related to the procedure used to construct @xmath0 .",
    "this also implies that one might expect the two statistics to behave differently when evolution becomes important  simply because evolution will , of course , break the separability of the _ underlying _ joint distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath10 , i.e. the conditional distributions of @xmath29 at given @xmath10 and @xmath10 at given @xmath29 will no longer be simply equal to their marginal distributions .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that an exploration of the systematic differences between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for deeper surveys may be an effective probe of evolution .",
    "we have developed the completeness test statistic , @xmath0 , first introduced in rauzy ( 2001 ) , technique to account for the presence of both a faint and bright apparent magnitude limit in magnitude - redshift samples .",
    "we have applied it to the mgc , sdss - dr1 and 2dfgrs surveys .",
    "our results confirm the completeness of data - sets such as sdss - dr1 ( early types only ) where a faint and bright limit is well defined and published in the literature .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that sdss - dr1 is complete in apparent magnitude up to the published magnitude limit of @xmath5 mag indicating no residual systematics .",
    "similarly , the magnitude completeness of the mgc survey has also been confirmed up to its published limit of @xmath167 mag .",
    "interestingly , however , we found that when we incorporated @xmath140-corrections to the mgc data - set , a noticeable ( although not statistically significant ) departure from the expected value of the @xmath0 statistic  and indeed from the computed value of @xmath0 for the uncorrected data  was observed close to the magnitude limit . a possible cause for this effect could be the mixing of galaxy populations to which a global @xmath140 is then applied  resulting in a slightly @xmath168 magnitude limit .",
    "our initial approach to the 2df galaxy survey was to apply the original rauzy test which accounts for a single , faint magnitude limit only .",
    "this was motivated by the current literature , in which @xmath169 a faint limiting magnitude of @xmath170 was well defined in the survey .",
    "however , our the application of our @xmath0 test reveal that the 2dfgrs is strongly inconsistent with being complete in apparent magnitude _ unless _ a secondary bright limit ( @xmath171 in our subset ) is included .",
    "finally , we have also developed another variant on the original rauzy @xmath0 completeness statistic , which we denote by @xmath1 , based on the cumulative distance distribution of galaxies in a magnitude - redshift survey .",
    "we find that @xmath1 has potential advantages over the widely used @xmath2/@xmath2@xmath3 test : not least , the @xmath1 statistic retains the same properties as that of @xmath0 ",
    "i.e. is independent of the spatial distribution of galaxies within the survey .",
    "furthermore , we have shown by example , that @xmath1  when applied to the",
    "same well calibrated and relatively shallow survey samples as @xmath0  produces almost identical results to that of the @xmath0 statistic .",
    "our future work in this area will explore the application of @xmath1 and @xmath0 to deeper surveys , where evolution and @xmath16-corrections become more important issues , to investigate the potential of these two statistics as diagnostics of luminosity and density evolution .",
