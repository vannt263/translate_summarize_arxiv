    "<S> this shows no significant spectral modulation , implying no q - switching instabilities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figs.[laser_res](e , f ) are the rf spectrum around the fundamental repetition rate and its tenth harmonic . a @xmath7070db peak - to - background ratio ( @xmath71 contrast ) is observed , indicating good mode - locking stability@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our graphene - based ultrafast laser , harnessing the wideband optical nonlinearity of graphene , with no need of bandgap engineering , extends the practical potential of this novel material from nanoelectronics to optoelectronics and integrated photonics .    </S>",
