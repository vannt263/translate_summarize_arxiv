    "these include the possibility of topological defects with their potential astrophysical and cosmological consequences .",

    "the model has been remarkably successful and would almost universally be accepted if ( and when ) the higgs particle is found . at the same time , it should be noted that only the perturbative features of the model have been put to the test and it would be worthwhile to have a better understanding of the non - perturbative aspects of the theory .",
    "such an understanding may be crucial , for example , for testing the hypothesis that the baryon number of the universe was produced ( baryogenesis ) during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe .",

    "as distinct from the drag force , the iordanskii force is invariant under the time reversal and thus is nondissipative .",
    "the aharanov - bohm interaction of particles with cosmic strings was discussed in @xcite .",
    "but for conventional ( nonspinning ) strings it gives rise only to the frictional drag force , which should be added to the drag force caused by to the scattering of particles off the core of the string @xcite . in condensed matter vortices",
    "the drag force is small in the considered limit @xmath545 and is neglected here .",
    "for the global relativistic string the sum of the nondissipative magnus and iordanskii type forces was discussed in @xcite and it was found that they arise only if the string is spinning .",
    "\\(iii ) the third term in eq .",
    "( 6.5.1 ) exists only in fermionic systems , where the fermion zero modes can exist .",
    "it was found recently that the spectral flow is unaffected by the temperature @xmath51 , since the temperature does not change the topology of the spectrum of fermion zero modes , and thus the parameter @xmath448 equals its zero temperature value in eq.(6.4.4 ) @xcite . in the real fermi",
    "- superfluids the existence of @xmath550 is defined by the condition @xmath545 . at low @xmath51 this condition can be violated and the discrete character of the spectrum suppresses the level flow , as a result this force disappears @xcite , while the magnus force always survives . on the other hand , if the anomalous force exists , it nearly compensates the magnus force , since in the real superfluids the mass density @xmath415 is very close to the anomaly parameter @xmath569 . that is why the anomaly within the core plays a very important part in the vortex dynamics .    in @xmath1he -",
    "b the anomalous ( spectral flow ) contribution to the force has been experimentally observed . when the temperature increases the regime of the suppressed spectral flow transfers to the regime where it nearly compensates the magnus force @xcite .",
    "this behavior reproduces the measured temperature dependence of the force acting on the vortex @xcite .      to clarify the analogy between the iordanskii force and aharonov - bohm effect ,",
    "let us consider the simplest cases of phonons propagating in the velocity field of the quantized vortex in the bose superfluid @xmath551he and fermions propagating in the velocity field of the quantized vortex in the fermi superfluid @xmath1he - a .",
    "according to unruh @xcite the dynamics of the phonons in the presence of the velocity field is the same as the dynamics of photons in the gravity field . for the velocity field of quantized vortex",
    "the phonons obey the equation of motion of the scalar wave in the metric @xmath570 here @xmath571 is the sound velocity , @xmath572 is the superfluid velocity around the vortex , and we use the cylindrical system of coordinates with the axis @xmath573 along the vortex line .",
    "the same metric takes place for the gapless bogoliubov fermions propagating in the field of the axisymmetric phase vortex with @xmath574 in the a - phase of superfluid @xmath1he @xcite .",
    "let us consider how the lagrangian for the fermions @xmath575 with @xmath576 from eq.(4.2.12 ) is modified in the presence of the superfluid velocity @xmath553 of the vortex .",
    "this potential flow flow can be gauged out by applying the gauge transformation in eq.(4.2.9 ) to the lagrangian . in the vicinity of the nodes",
    "this gives : @xmath577 where the vierbein give the folowing metric tensor @xmath578 with the components @xmath579 in this case the `` velocity of light '' is anisotropic and its transverse component @xmath580 enters eq .",
    "( 6.6.1 ) if only the motion in the transverse plane is considered .    far from the vortex , where @xmath581 is small and can be neglected , this metric corresponds to that of the so called spinning cosmic string . the spinning cosmic string",
    "( see the recent references @xcite ) is a string which has rotational angular momentum .",
    "the metric in eq .",
    "( 6.6.1 ) corresponds to a string with angular momentum @xmath582 per unit length and with zero mass .",
    "the effect peculiar to the spinning string is the gravitational aharonov - bohm topological effect @xcite .",
    "though the metric outside the string is flat , there is a time difference for the particles propagating around the spinning string in opposite directions . for the vortex ( at large distances from the core )",
    "this time delay approaches @xmath583 this asymmetry between the particles moving on different sides of the vortex is just the origin of the iordanskii force acting on the vortex in the presence of the net momentum of the quasiparticles : @xmath584 .",
    "as distinct from the linear momentum , the orbital angular momentum projection @xmath585 and the generalized angular momentum @xmath477 in the axisymmetric environment are quantized integer or half of odd integer quantities and they can serve as a model for the quantized and integer baryonic charge in electroweak theory .",
    "the symmetry @xmath477 of different inhomogeneous but axisymmetric vacua in eqs.(6.1.2 ) tells us that @xmath477 is a conserved quantity .",
    "moreover , since @xmath477 is the sum of the generator which correspond to the particle number , angular and spin momenta , the charge @xmath477 is integer ( or half of odd integer ) quantum number from the very beginning .",
    "thus the correct calculations of the total charge of the whole system ( vacuum plus excitations ) should also give integer or half integer value .",
    "eq.(6.1.2 ) does not mean , however , that the @xmath477-charge of the vacuum is always zero . in the pure fermionic description",
    "the total charge of the vacuum is @xmath586 where @xmath587 are the energy eigenvalues of eq.(4.2.10 ) for fermions in the axisymmetric field of the order parameter , @xmath588 is the heaviside function which restricts the sum so that only the negative energy states contribute to the vacuum charge .",
    "the @xmath477 charge of the vacuum can be nonzero if some discrete symmetry is broken and @xmath589 .",
    "an example of nonzero vacuum charge is presented by ferromagnets , where the @xmath590 spin rotation symmetry is broken to @xmath591 .",
    "so the spin projection @xmath592 is a good quantum number ( charge ) .",
    "the absence of the time - inversion symmetry leads to the net charge @xmath593 of the vacuum , which corresponds to the spontaneous magnetic moment of the ferromagnet .",
    "let us consider the @xmath477-charge of the continuous @xmath180 vortex in eq.(3.3.1 ) for which @xmath594 . then according to eq .",
    "( 6.1.2c ) this charge corresponds to the `` electric '' charge @xmath595 of the homogeneous vacuum in which the vector @xmath75 is oriented along @xmath596 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the @xmath180 vortex can be continuously transformed to this homogeneous vacuum state . for simplicity the function @xmath597 , which enters the axisymmetric ansatz for the @xmath180 vortex in eq .",
    "( 3.3.1 ) will be considered as a constant .",
    "first we use the macroscopic ( hydrodynamic ) description in terms of the anomaly equation . in this approach ,",
    "the orbital momentum @xmath585 of the vacuum state is the momentum of the mass current @xmath598 in eq.(5.2.10 ) : @xmath599 for the axisymmetric texture , eq .",
    "( 2.1.10 ) for the superfluid vorticity is simplified : @xmath600 and can be integrated , to obtain the velocity distribution in terms of the @xmath75 texture .",
    "the resulting velocity field without singularity on the axis ( at @xmath183 ) is : @xmath601 which requires @xmath596 .",
    "the integration of the first two ( regular ) terms in eq.(5.2.10 ) , after integration by part and using the boundary condition @xmath602 ( there are no particles outside the vessel of radius @xmath286 ) , gives the contribution to @xmath603 : @xmath604 here @xmath49 is the total number of particles .",
    "as a result the charge @xmath605 of the vacuum is given by the last term in the current which resulted from the anomaly equation ( 5.2.7 ) : @xmath606 @xmath607 where @xmath285 is the height of the vessel and @xmath286 its radius .",
    "thus the vacuum accumulates nonzero @xmath477 charge only if the @xmath75 texture contains helicity , @xmath608 , in complete correspondence with the baryonic charge accumulated by the helical gauge fields @xcite .",
    "the helicity of the @xmath75 texture is nonzero only for @xmath609 : @xmath610 also , @xmath611 is nonzero only if the parities @xmath494 ( @xmath612 ) and @xmath613 are broken ( @xmath51 is the time inversion symmetry and @xmath614 is the rotation by @xmath152 about transverse axis , see eq.(6.2.2 ) ) .",
    "one also can rewrite this @xmath477-charge of the vacuum using the axial anomaly equation .",
    "again one considers the process in which the @xmath75-texture is constant , but the parameter @xmath615 changes from zero at @xmath434 ( when @xmath433 , the axial field @xmath616 and the @xmath477 charge of the vacuum is zero ) to its equilibrium value at present time @xmath617 : @xmath618 the integrand describes the transfer of the chiral charge from the vacuum to the chiral fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "each created left fermion carries ( at the moment of creation ) the local charge @xmath619 within the semiclassical ( macroscopic ) description of the fermions .    actually on the microscopic level this transfer of the charge",
    "@xmath477 should occur in quantum steps at the moment when the fermionic level crosses zero energy .",
    "thus one obtains an integer value ( or half integer , if the vortex is singly quantized ) , which in the limit of large @xmath477 transforms to the macroscopic expression ( 6.7.6 ) .",
    "let us consider how this occurs at large @xmath477 .",
    "we consider the evolution of the @xmath477 charge of the vacuum during the change of the texture from the initial state with @xmath620 ( and @xmath489 ) to the final state with finite @xmath115 . during the evolution of the vortex structure , @xmath477 levels cross the zero energy and",
    "this leads to the acumulation of the charge @xmath477 in the vacuum .",
    "the rate of the charge @xmath477 production can be found from the following consideration . in the limit of large @xmath477 the spectrum @xmath500 crosses zero as a function of @xmath477 at some @xmath621 .",
    "this function @xmath621 changes in the process of the modification of the vortex .",
    "since the states with @xmath622 have positive ( negative ) energy while the states with @xmath623 have negative ( positive ) energy , the change of @xmath621 induces the flow of the @xmath477 levels through zero with the rate @xmath624 . since at each event",
    "the charge @xmath621 is transferred from the vacuum to the fermionic degrees of freedom , the total rate of the charge transfer is @xmath625 thus if one starts from the most symmetric vortex and continuously transfers this state into the vortex with broken symmetry , one obtains the following general result for the charge @xmath477 of the vortex : @xmath626 this is valid for any axisymmetric vortex in any superfluid and superconductor .    for the continuous @xmath180 vortex @xcite @xmath627 where @xmath628 is the radius at which @xmath629 the energy levels with the lowest @xmath630 correspond to the radial quantum @xmath631 and",
    "are given by @xmath632 though @xmath477 is discrete , the distance between the @xmath477 levels @xmath633 is very small compared with the gap amplitude @xmath314 , which means that the effective @xmath477 is large and can be considered as continuous .",
    "calculating the sum in eq.(6.7.10 ) using the eq.(6.7.11 ) one reproduces the macroscopic result in eq.(6.7.6 ) @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have discussed various aspects of @xmath1he and pointed out the similarities to the standard electroweak model of particle physics .",
    "these analogies occur on the level of symmetry groups and also on the interaction of fermions with the order parameter .",
    "we have discussed the topological defects that exist in @xmath1he - a and have been observed in the laboratory .",
    "the @xmath180 vortex in @xmath1he is directly analogous to the @xmath121-string in the electroweak model .",
    "the similarity in the interactions of fermions with the order parameter leads to similar anomalies in the two systems . in the electroweak model ,",
    "baryon number conservation is anomalous while in @xmath1he the conservation of angular momentum - without accounting for the angular momentum of the quasiparticles - is anomalous .",
    "the presence of the anomaly can also be deduced from the existence of fermionic zero modes in both systems .    while there are striking similarities between the two systems , there are some obvious differences too that can not be ignored .",
    "a crucial difference at the level of symmetries is that the symmetries in @xmath1he are global but those in the standard model are gauged .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom too are very different - the standard model has three families each of which has 15 fermions ( including the color degree of freedom ) while @xmath1he only has 4 fermions . in any case",
    ", we do not expect the analogy between the two systems to be exact .",
    "but the presence of certain similarities in itself should be useful to address certain field theoretic questions arising in one system in the context of the other system .",
    "for example , calculations in the condensed matter literature show that the change in the anomalously conserved angular momentum is always an integer @xcite while corresponding calculations in the particle physics literature find a non - integer value @xcite .",
    "we feel that the analogy between the two systems could be exploited to resolve such issues .",
    "in addition , advantage could be taken of the experiments currently being performed on @xmath1he .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the linear momentum anomaly caused by the spectral flow of fermions in the vortex has recently been observed in @xmath1he - b by measuring the temperature dependence of the force acting on moving vortices @xcite ( see sec .",
