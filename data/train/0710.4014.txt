    "one of the most dynamic fields in arena of particle acceleration has been the area of laser - plasma based accelerators  @xcite . this rapid development and world - wide interest",
    "is driven by the fact that far larger accelerating gradients can be exploited than in conventional accelerators ( in excess of @xmath1 v / m  @xcite compared to 10 s of mev / m in conventional designs ) .",
    "consequently , laser driven accelerators hold the promise of compact accelerating structures , which may be advantageous for a number of applications  @xcite . after only a very short period of development",
    "laser - accelerated proton beams  @xcite have been shown to have very small longitudinal and transverse emittance  @xcite . however , the excellent emittance is the result of a very short initial burst duration and a very small virtual source size .",
    "by extension the proton beam emerging from the target has a broad energy spectrum ( @xmath2 up to @xmath3 ) and large , energy dependent , divergence angle ( typically 40 - 60 @xmath4 depending on laser and target parameters ) .",
    "the manipulation of laser generated proton beams gives new challenges due to the high bunch charge and short pulse nature of the beams , requiring innovative approaches to enable beam control - recently a technique employing electric fields triggered by a second laser pulse on a separate target , has been used for focusing selectively a portion of the beam spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , the inherent large divergence and energy spread can make it hard to utilise the full flux of the proton beam for applications and indeed for further transport and beam manipulation .",
    "here we demonstrate a novel target configuration which , without the need for an auxiliary laser pulse , exploits the self - charging of the target to improve the collimation of the entire proton beam , while conserving the characteristic high laminarity required for radiography applications  @xcite .",
    "this approach also allows the control of chromatic properties of the beam and creation of achromatic electrostatic lenses , by exploiting the strong temporal variation of the target potential .",
    "hence this technique allows the full flux of the proton beam to be used in many demanding applications in science , medicine and industry  @xcite .        in high power laser interactions with solid targets , a significant fraction of the laser energy",
    "gets transferred to the hot electron population . above a peak laser intensity @xmath5 , experiments  @xcite and particle - in - cell simulations",
    "@xcite have reported laser - to - electron conversion efficiencies up to 50% .",
    "most of the absorbed energy is carried by the forward moving hot electron population with an electron spectrum that can be approximated as an exponential @xmath6 , with a temperature of the order of the ponderomotive potential of the incident laser [ @xmath7 mev , where @xmath8 is the normalized laser vector potential ] .",
    "a small fraction of the hot electron population escapes and rapidly charges the target to a potential of the order of @xmath9 preventing the bulk of the hot electrons from escaping .",
    "the time dependence of the target potential is governed by the self - capacitance of the target ( @xmath10 ) . at a given time t",
    ", the number of electrons that have escaped from the target is given by @xmath11 which satisfies the equation , @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is electron charge and @xmath14 is the cut - off energy ( in mev ) of the confined electron spectrum . assuming the lateral velocity of the charge wave equals to @xmath15  @xcite , the time dependent target self - capacitance can be estimated as that of a disk of increasing radius @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is permitivity of vacuum and @xmath18 the laser spot size on the target . from these considerations it follows that the target potential remains above several mv for all relevant time scales considered here .",
    "targets charged to similar potentials have been shown to produce substantial transverse deflections of of multi - mev proton beams  @xcite .",
    "suitable design of the target geometry ( as shown later ) therefore enables a strong electrostatic lens to be created .",
    "the experiment was performed at rutherford appleton laboratory employing vulcan petawatt laser system .",
    "the laser pulse delivered @xmath19  300j of energy on target in  500 - 600 fs fwhm duration .",
    "using an f/3 off - axis parabola , the laser was focussed to 8 @xmath20 fwhm spot with a peak intensity @xmath21 .",
    "two basic shapes of electrostatic lens geometries , rectangular and cylindrical ( fig .",
    "[ expt_setup](a - b ) ) were investigated and compared to the performance of flat au foil targets .",
    "for all shots the laser interacted with a 15 @xmath20 thick au foil at its centre , at an angle of incidence of  40 degrees from target normal .",
    "all targets were mounted on @xmath193 millimeter thick and @xmath192 centimeters long plastic stalks in order to provide a highly resistive path to the current flowing from target to ground .",
    "spatial and spectral profiles of the multi - mev proton beam emitted normally from either side of the target were measured by employing stacks of radiochromic films ( a dosimetry detector  @xcite ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ expt_setup](c ) .",
    "the dose response of the rcf detectors were calibrated by exposing them to various known doses of protons from a linear accelerator  @xcite . in some shots , cu sheets of suitable thickness",
    "were inserted in the stacks in order to obtain proton spectrum via activation measurements  @xcite , complementary to those obtained from rcf dose measurements .",

    "significant ( up to a factor of two ) reductions in the proton beam divergence angle were observed in case of the lens - targets when compared to free - standing flat foils .",
    "the angular divergence of the low energy part ( up to 25 mev ) of the spectrum was observed to be highly reproducible ( @xmath23 ) for the flat foil targets ( typical proton beam profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ data](a ) ) . in order to ensure that the observed effect was unambiguously due to the target geometry , rectangular lens - targets ( see fig .  [ expt_setup](b ) )",
    "were employed .",
    "[ data](b ) shows a 2d flux profile of the proton beam obtained from a rectangular lens - target . instead of the typical near - circular beam profile , an elliptical profile ( with a major to minor axes ratio of up to 2:1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ data](b ) ) is observed .",
    "only the divergence of protons that have propagated through the lens is affected ( i.e. the protons propagating towards the laser are not affected by the modified target geometry ) .",
    "mounting the rectangular lens on the front surface of the proton generating foil , resulted in an elliptical spatial profile of the proton beam propagating towards the laser .",
    "as expected in this case , the proton beam from the rear side of the target retains a spatial dose profile similar to that from flat foil target . employing lens - targets with cylindrical symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ expt_setup](b ) ) , resulted in a near - circular profile of rear side protons ( fig .",
    "[ ptrace ] ) with significant reduction in beam divergence as compared to the flat foil case .    the spectral shape and overall dose is not affected by the addition of a lens element to the target geometry .",
    "spatially integrated proton beam spectra from both plain foil and lens - targets agree to within the typical shot to shot variations .",
    "consequently an increase in the proton flux commensurate with the reduction in beam size is seen in the case of lens - targets with respect to the plain foil case ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ data](c ) ) .",
    "moreover , no significant change in the proton beam cut - off energy was found in case of the lens - targets in comparison to the plain foil targets .",
    "this suggests that the accelerating fields are not affected by the addition of a lens structure .",
    "this is in good agreement with expectations since the time it takes for the charge wave to spread to the lens far exceeds the proton acceleration time @xcite .",
    "3d particle tracing simulations , employing ptrace  @xcite , were carried out in order to study the focussing due to the electrostatic lens formed by the self - charging of the target .",
    "the temporal evolution of the target potential is calculated by considering the self - capacitance of a charged disk of radius @xmath24 and an exponential electron distribution with a temperature of @xmath25 as described above .",
    "the potential of the target is assumed constant after the charge wave reaches the end of the lens at a time time @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the inner diameter and length of the cylindrical lens as shown in fig .",
    "[ expt_setup](b ) .",
    "the electric field at a given point and at a given time is obtained by superimposing the contributions from every part of the charged target .",
    "test particles ( protons ) are launched from a point source with a divergence and initial position taken from experimental observations on shots with a flat foil . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ ptrace](a ) , the steady state electric field profile due to a circular lens - target fielded in the experiment resembles that of a conventional electrostatic _",
    "einzel _ lens and therefore acts to reduce the proton beam divergence by the strong transverse field near the edge of the charged lens - target .",
    "since the proton beam is strongly divergent inside the lens the longitudinal field also contributes to the collimation of the beam .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ ptrace](b ) and ( c ) , the simulated proton beam parameters at the detector plane closely match the experimentally observed beam in both the overall dimension ( divergence ) as well as the mesh magnification .",
    "good agreement between model and observation was obtained across different energies and for all circular lens - targets as shown in fig  [ comparison ] .",
    "both the simulations and the experimental data show no significant loss of intrinsic proton beam emittance .",
    "this is demonstrated by the clearly visible radiographs of the mesh ( both experimentally as well as in the simulations ) .",
    "radiographs taken with two meshes confirm that the that the protons follow straight line trajectories outside the focussing field region .    ] , next to the respective data points .",

    "solid(dotted ) lines are simulated values for 0.5 micron thick cylindrical lens - targets of @xmath22 equals to 2 mm(1 mm).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    from the comparison of simple einzel - lens type configuration it is clear that the properties of the proton beam can be manipulated effectively . from the presented data it is clear that compensating for the residual divergence ( around 20 degrees ) could be achieved with a secondary lens target  @xcite and result in a beam collimated to a diameter of a few mm size .",
    "the strong role that the detailed geometry plays can be seen in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , where the reduction in the proton beam divergence for a number of lens - targets of different geometries is shown .",
    "collimation increases with decreasing aspect ratio @xmath22/l for the rectangular lens ( or g / l for the cylindrical case ) and decreases with increasing wall thickness t. these effects are consistent with the higher fields obtained for a given potential for smaller structures , changes in the interaction length and variations in target capacitance respectively .",

    "red dashed line illustrates chromatic behaviour of a simulated static electrostatic lens.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    so far we have only discussed the behaviour of the proton beam at a given proton energy .",
    "however , the focusing strength of an electrostatic lens varies strongly with beam energy - i.e. it is chromatic . harnessing the full potential of these beams",
    "( e.g. by focusing them to one spot or coupling the whole bunch into a post - accelerator or phase - rotator ) requires that the chromatic behaviour be addressed .",
    "the dynamic charging and discharging of the investigated structures allow a significant control of the chromatic behaviour of the electrostatic lens . as the charge wave spreads at much higher speed than the protons ,",
    "complete charging up of the target is attained much earlier than the protons leave the active focussing field region .",
    "the protons are therefore still in the field of the lens during the discharging period .",
    "the target discharges primarily due to the current flowing through the stalk holding the target . in our case ,",
    "abrupt discharging of the lens target was avoided by employing insulating stalks .",
    "clearly the discharge time scale will also be a function of the lens material . as shown in fig .  [ discharging ] the aluminium targets discharge ( and",
    "hence lose their focusing field ) much more rapidly than the plastic targets . for our geometry",
    "the discharge time constant for the aluminium lens was roughly 7.5 ps , resulting in substantial drop of the lens potential during the particle transit .",
    "consequently , the slower particles see a reduced collimating field and experience a smaller reduction in beam divergence .",
    "note that for a constant potential the slower protons would experience a larger drop in beam divergence inversely proportional to the proton velocity ( see fig .  [ discharging ] ) . in the case of the plastic lens",
    "the discharge time is clearly much longer ( @xmath1915 ps ) . in this case",
    "the slower reduction in lens potential almost perfectly compensates the enhanced collimation expected at lower energies for constant lens potential , resulting in an achromatic collimating system .",
    "clearly , similar approaches can be taken to achieve achromatic focusing or a compensation of the initial chromatic dependency of the proton beam divergence . for example mounting the target with much thinner ( few microns ) insulating wires is expected to result in negligible discharging of the target during the relevant time scale  @xcite , resulting in significant improvement in lower energy proton beam collimation .",
    "indeed , further improvement in the beam collimation can be achieved by suitably modified lens - target designs .",
    "for instance , reducing the wall thickness ( t ) from 0.5 mm to 50@xmath20 will substantially increase the surface charge density .",
    "similarly , the observed increase in beam collimation with longer @xmath29 and shorter @xmath28 suggests , a conical ( instead of cylindrical ) lens geometry will produce stronger focussing by guiding the beam optimally from its source .",
    "for example , in case of a 30 degree conical lens - target with initial diameter of 0.4 mm , l=2 mm and t=50@xmath20 , simulations predict in excess of factor of three reduction of few mev proton beam divergence for the discussed experimental conditions .",
    "this implies an order of magnitude increase in the proton flux which would be promising for high energy density physics and fusion research .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that by careful choice of target geometry an electrostatic lens can be formed which improves the collimation of the protons emitted from a laser irradiated foil target .",
    "significant reductions in the beam divergence and commensurate increase in flux have been observed without sacrificing the high beam quality in excellent agreement with 3d particle tracing simulations .",
    "in addition , it is possible to offset the chromatic nature of an electrostatic lens with the discharging of the lens structure allowing for near - achromatic lens performance and a route for correcting chromatic aberrations inherent in the proton beam production process .",
