    "high resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) together with other highly resolved spectroscopies such as angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , is making it possible to obtain a comprehensive mapping of the electronic spectrum of the high - temperature superconductors ( htss ) in both real and reciprocal space over a wide range of dopings and temperatures .",
    "these studies are providing insight into the rich phase diagrams of the htss , and are leading thus to an understanding of the missing links for developing a definitive theory of how high superconducting transition temperatures arise in these unconventional materials . in sts experiments , the focus to date has been on hole doped cuprates , especially on bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) , which has been the subject of an overwhelming amount of experimental work , see , e.g , refs . .",
    "bi2212 is a typical cuprate material , which is an antiferromagetic insulator in the strongly underdoped regime , but exhibits a superconducting phase over a wide range of hole doping .",
    "sts can be applied to a substantial part of the doping and temperature spanned phase space of hts materials .",
    "the superconducting ( sc ) phase is observed around optimal hole doping ( op ) , while the pseudogap ( pg ) phase is found within the underdoped regime ( ud ) . as a practical limitation , sts requires a conducting sample , but the deeply underdoped regime is insulating and hence unreachable by sts . however , under experimental conditions the samples are not homogeneously doped .",
    "rather , there is a strong spatial variation in doping , which makes observation of a continuum from the pg to the sc phase possible within one sample .",
    "although these spatial variations in sts generally appear irregular , quite recently a more ordered coexistence of pg and sc phases has been observed @xcite .",
    "the physics of the cuprates is dominated by the cuprate layers , which are usually not exposed to the tip of the apparatus .",
    "for example , in bi2212 , the quasiparticle tunneling takes place through insulating bio and sro layers .",
    "the conventional interpretation of the spectra is based on the assumption that the sts spectrum is directly proportional to the ldos of the cuo@xmath4 layer , especially the ldos of the @xmath3 orbitals , thus neglecting the effects of the tunneling process in modifying the spectrum in the presence of the insulating overlayers and multiple orbitals .",
    "the motivation for this simplification is an attempt to reduce the quasiparticle structure to few band models , which are amenable to theoretical treatment of strong correlation effects in the presence of superconducting and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "notably , there have been attempts to take the effect of the overlayers into account by assuming a ` tunneling matrix element ' or a ` filter function ' @xcite .    with this background ,",
    "our recent work on sts@xcite of bi2212 provides a significant advance in realistic material - specific modeling of the sts spectrum .",
    "we invoke a green s function approach where a _",
    "large _ number of orbitals is included , and all tunneling paths to the tip in the semi - infinite solid are taken into account .",
    "we showed clearly that instead of being a simple reflection of ldos of the cu-@xmath3 orbitals , the sts signal represents a very complex mapping of the electronic structure of the system .    in this study",
    "we extend our approach by decomposing the tunneling current in terms of regular and anomalous matrix elements of the spectral function in an atomic orbital basis . as in ref . , we concentrate on bi2212 as the canonical hts material .",
    "we start by reformulating the well - established methods to model tunneling current in nanostructures into a more transparent form for interpreting tunneling in the superconducting state .",
    "our derivation is based on the conventional todorov - pendry @xcite approach ( tp ) , which is closely related to the more common tersoff - hamann @xcite method ( th ) .",
    "tp and th methods both employ a calculation of the ldos , but tp is more naturally written in terms of green s functions .",
    "we will show , in fact , that tp decomposes into matrix elements of the spectral function , giving very detailed information concerning the origin of various features in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "we thus demonstrate how the contribution of different atomic orbitals to the total current can be extracted from the calculations .",
    "our spectral decomposition also naturally distinguishes between the electron and hole nature of the quasiparticles in the superconducting state .",
    "in addition , it leads to a multiband generalization of filtering function by martin et al @xcite and a clarification of selection rules governing tunneling through filtering layers .",
    "this information is important , e.g. , in determining how a dopant or impurity atom alters the spectrum , and how the effect of such a perturbation is seen in real space .    in order to gain a handle on the effects of filtering layers",
    ", we derive a consistent form of a filter function through green s function manipulations .",
    "this rigorous form for the filtering effects is useful for determining the relation between the tunnel current and the ldos of the cuo@xmath1 layers .",
    "we show that this relation is nontrivial in that some channels are ` first - order forbidden ' .",
    "thus our new approach shows that no direct regular signal from @xmath3 orbitals of the cu directly below the stm tip reaches the microscope .",
    "instead the @xmath3 orbitals of the four neighboring cu atoms give a major contribution to the tunneling signal .",
    "although we concentrate on pristine systems in the present work , the results have important implications for inhomogeneous situations ",
    "e.g. , the relationship between the observed features in the spectrum of an impurity atom and the underlying ldos .",
    "this decomposition also allows treatment of the regular and anomalous propagation of quasiparticles in a superconductor , and on this basis we show that the coherence peaks result from the anomalous electron - hole propagation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model for the geometrical structure and the electronic structure is introduced in sections  ii.a and b , respectively . the methods to calculate the green s function in the normal and the superconducting state",
    "are derived in sections ii.b and c , respectively .",
    "the todorov - pendry equation for the tunneling current is decomposed into regular and anomalous terms to show not only the proper form of the matrix element but also the partial current terms for any chosen orbital in section ii.d .",
    "the formalism is applied to discuss stm topographic maps in section  iii.a , and the sts spectrum of bi2212 in section  iii.b . the spectrum is then analyzed in terms of tunneling matrix elements and partial currents in section  iii.c .",

    "<S> the formalism is applied to the case of optimally doped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) high - tc superconductor using a large tight - binding basis set of electron and hole orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the results show clearly that the spectrum is modified strongly by the effects of the tunneling matrix element and that it is not a simple replica of the local density of states ( ldos ) of the cu-@xmath3 orbitals with other orbitals playing a key role in shaping the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the spectrum can be decomposed usefully in terms of tunneling channels or paths through which the current flows from various orbitals in the system to the scanning tip . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis reveals symmetry forbidden and symmetry enhanced paths between the tip and the cuprate layers . </S>",
    "<S> significant contributions arise from not only the cuo@xmath1 layer closest to the tip , but also from the second cuo@xmath1 layer . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum also contains a longer range background reflecting the non - local nature of the underlying bloch states . in the superconducting state , </S>",
    "<S> coherence peaks are found to be dominated by the anomalous components of green s function . </S>"
