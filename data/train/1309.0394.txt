    "this paper aims to illustrate the unifying power of the notion of topos , due to grothendieck , in the context of cyclic homology .",

    "this result raises naturally the question of a conceptual interpretation of cyclic homology of schemes . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that cyclic cohomology can be interpreted as ext - functor in the category of cyclic modules .",
    "these modules are defined as contravariant functors from the ( small ) cyclic category @xmath7 to the category of abelian groups .",
    "this development brings at the forefront the crucial role played by the cyclic category as an extension of the simplicial category @xmath8 by finite cyclic groups .",
    "moreover , in _ op.cit .",
    "_  it was also shown that the classifying space @xmath9 is equal to the classifying space of the topological group @xmath10 , and later it was discovered ( _ cf._@xcite ) that the geometric realization of the simplicial set underlying a cyclic set ( this latter understood as a contravariant functor @xmath11 to the category of sets ) inherits naturally an action of @xmath10 .",
    "the equality @xmath12 then leads to a deep analogy between cyclic cohomology and @xmath10-equivariant cohomology .    in this article",
    "we show that one obtains a conceptual understanding of the above @xmath10-action on the geometric realization of cyclic sets by extending that result to the framework of topos theory .",
    "the transition from a small category to its classifying space produces in general a substantial loss of information : the classifying space of @xmath8 is , for instance , a singleton .",
