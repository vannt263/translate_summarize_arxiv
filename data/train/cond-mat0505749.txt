    "cortical neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs . the neurons might receive high - frequency presynaptic inputs . extracting intrinsic signals from random fluctuations in high - frequency presynaptic inputs",
    "is a severe challenge .",
    "some mechanisms that reduce a gain for presynaptic inputs might work at synaptic sites . such gain control can not be achieved through fixed synaptic weights because input rates change dynamically .",
    "neurophysiological experiments show that high - frequency inputs induce the decrease of synaptic weights @xcite .",
    "this process is known as short - term synaptic depression .",
    "the synaptic depression is known to control the gain for presynaptic inputs @xcite .",
    "this property might influence not only the activity of a single neuron but also that of the overall activity @xcite .    however , it is still a controversial issue what are functional roles of the gain control . to elucidate the functional roles ,",
    "some information must be embedded in the synaptic connections .",
    "we employ an associative memory model that stores memory patterns in synaptic connections .",
    "only a few works have investigated how the synaptic depression affects the performance of the associative memory model @xcite .",
    "the memory patterns embedded by hebb rule @xcite become fixed points , i.e. , attractors @xcite .",

    "found that the synaptic depression reduced a storage capacity @xcite .",
    "torres et al . found that the storage capacity decreased with the degree of the depression in a thermodynamical limit @xcite .",
    "however , the main targets of these works were the steady states of the models .",
    "it is necessary to investigate the dynamical properties of the model because the synapses change dynamically .",
    "one of the important dynamical properties is basins of attraction which express the regions where the system converges to stored patterns . in the view of information processing",

    "bibitchkov et al .",
    "found that the synaptic depression _ shrunk _",
    "the basins of attraction at a large loading rate and increased them a little at a small loading rate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we propose a new hypothesis that the synaptic depression _ enlarges _ the basins of attraction not only at a small loading rate but at a large loading rate .",
    "we employ a binary discrete - time associative memory model which consists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons .",
    "the memory patterns with a small firing rate , i.e. , sparse patterns , are embedded in the synaptic connections among the excitatory neurons .",

    "we also investigate whether the excitatory - inhibitory balance and the synaptic depression work cooperatively or not .",
    "this paper consists of seven sections .",

    "we investigate how the synaptic depression influences the performance of the model which consists of only excitatory neurons . in the section 6 we investigate the relationship between the synaptic depression and the excitatory - inhibitory balance . in the section 7",

    "the synaptic weights between the excitatory neurons and the inhibitory neurons are uniform .",
    "there are no connections among the inhibitory neurons .",

    "recently , galarreta and hestrin found that long - term firing induced a much stronger depression of excitatory synapses than that of inhibitory synapses although the initial rates of depression were similar at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses @xcite .",
    "the result implies that the synaptic depression induces strong depression at excitatory synapses , it induces weak depression at inhibitory synapses .",
