    "cognitive radio ( cr ) is a promising technology offering enhanced spectrum efficiency via dynamic spectrum access [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . in a cr network ,",
    "unlicensed secondary users ( su ) can opportunistically occupy the unused spectrum allocated to a licensed primary user ( pu ) .",
    "this is achieved by means of pu signal detection .",
    "detection of pu signal entails sensing the spectrum occupied by the licensed user in a continuous manner .",
    "based on the sensing data , the su is required to decide whether or not a pu exists . a common problem encountered in cr systems is the _ hidden terminal problem _ [ 3 ] , where shadowing and multipath fading affect the strength of the pu signal causing it to be undetectable .",
    "hence , spatial diversity is applied by utilizing multiple decisions from several su terminals using a decision fusion rule .",
    "the fusion rule is applied by a central terminal known as the _ fusion center_. two basic approaches for decision combining are discussed in literature : _ soft decision _ ( sd ) and _ hard decision _ ( hd ) combining .",
    "the former relies on adding the sensed energies , while the latter combines one - bit local decisions to make a final decision [ 4 ] .    in this work , we tackle the problem of optimizing the hd combining scheme based on neyman - pearson ( np ) criterion . while the optimal np test has been formulated for the sd combining case [ 4 ] , it is much more challenging to apply an optimal np test for the hd combining scheme .",
    "the reason for this is that every su employs a local detection threshold , while the fusion center applies a global threshold to make a final decision on the existence of a pu .",
    "thus , unlike the simple one - dimensional problem in sd combining , two degrees of freedom are considered in the hd combining optimization problem . in his pioneering work , tsitsiklist",
    "[ 5 ] showed that the problem is mathematically intractable and an exhaustive search would be used to obtain local detection thresholds .",
    "in a recent comprehensive survey , quan _ et al _ [ 6 ] pointed out that computing the optimal decision thresholds under the np criterion is mathematically intractable .",
    "various suboptimal solutions were presented in literature . in [ 7 ] ,",
    "the problem was solved by simply fixing local thresholds and obtaining the optimum global threshold or vice versa .",
    "recently , the problem was revisited in [ 8 ] , were large deviation analysis was used to determine a local decision rule to optimize the asymptotic global performance . however , the intractability of the exact np optimization problem was again emphasized . in literature , the adopted hd combining rules are never globally optimal .",
    "researchers usually employ simple suboptimal and , or or majority counting rules for global detection [ 9][10 ] .",
    "others try to calculate the optimim local and global thresholds but mainly using exhaustive numerical methods [ 11][12 ] . in [ 4 ] , the performance of the sd combining scheme with np test was compared with an or - rule based hd combining scheme , which is not necessarily optimal .",
    "the problem of hd and sd performance comparison was thoroughly studied in [ 12 ] .",
    "however , the authors used suboptimal counting rules and stated that the threshold calculations are not trivial as complex optimization schemes are needed to solve them .",
    "although simple fusion rules , such as the or rule , is usually found to be optimal for cognitive radio networks with small number of cooperating sus , it was never verified in literature that the same applies for dense networks with large number of sus . in this work ,",
    "we propose a globally optimal decision fusion rule for hd combining based on neyman - pearson criterion .",
    "it is shown that the np optimal thresholds can be obtained by solving a simple one - dimensional convex optimization problem .",
    "besides , we obtain a closed form expression for the local detection threshold as a function of the optimal global threshold .",
    "a simple and efficient algorithm for optimizing global and local thresholds is proposed .",
    "although the algorithm is general and can be applied for any number of sus , it is shown that it offers significant performance gain compared to the or rule in networks with large number of cooperating users .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the system model .",
    "next , we propose the globally optimal hd combining scheme in section 3 .",
    "simulation results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "we investigate cooperative spectrum sensing in a cr network with @xmath1 cognitive users and a single common receiver ( fusion center ) .",
    "we assume that the su observes @xmath2 samples for spectrum sensing .",
    "energy detection is adopted as a spectrum sensing technique .",
    "it is assumed that the instantaneous snr at the @xmath3 node is @xmath4 and the primary signal @xmath5 sample at the @xmath3 cr is @xmath6 , and considered constant with unity power for the entire sensing period .",
    "the additive white noise is @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 sample received at the @xmath3 cr is a binary hypothesis give by : @xmath10    the conditional distributions on null and alternative hypotheses are : @xmath11    where @xmath12 denotes the absence of the pu , while @xmath13 denotes the existence of the pu . after applying such signal to an _ energy detector _ and obtaining binary decisions on pu existence , the local false alarm and detection probabilities at the @xmath3 cr are [ 2 ] : @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the local threshold , @xmath17 is the incomplete gamma function , @xmath18 is the gamma function , and @xmath19 is the generalized marcum q - function .",
    "we assume rayleigh fading with an average snr of @xmath20 .",
    "the average snr is assumed to be the same for all cr users .",
    "the instantaneous snr is assumed to be constant over the @xmath2 observable samples .",
    "different observations perceive different snr values .",
    "the snr varies according to the exponential pdf : @xmath21 the reporting channel between the sus and the fusion center is assumed to be free of errors .",
    "in this section , we propose a globally optimal algorithm for hd combining based on the neyman - pearson criterion .",
    "the ultimate goal of a neyman - pearson test is to maximize the detection probability for a given false alarm probability .",
    "the overall performance of the hd scheme is determined by the global detection and false alarm probabilities , which are functions of the local detection and false alarm probabilities given in equation ( 3 ) . as the fusion center employs an _",
    "n - out - of - n rule _ fusion rule , we let @xmath22 be the test statistic denoting the number of votes for the existence of pu from the @xmath1 su votes . hence , the conditional pdfs follow the _ binomial distribution _ as [ 3 ] : @xmath23 and @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the local detection probability averaged over the fading channel pdf as follows : @xmath26 and the global false alarm and detection probabilities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are [ 3][12 ] : @xmath29    @xmath30    the global neyman - pearson threshold for the discrete observable random variable @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "we search for the pair of thresholds @xmath32 that maximizes the global detection probability @xmath28 for @xmath27 = @xmath33 .",
    "unlike the conventional neyman - pearson detection schemes , we have two degrees of freedom dictated by the local and global thresholds .",
    "the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of the binomial distribution can be written in the form of the _ regularized incomplete beta function _ defined as [ 13 , eq .",
    "6.6.2 ] : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the upper incomplete beta function and @xmath36 is the beta function .",
    "the cdf of a binomial random variable @xmath37 is @xmath38 [ 13 , eq .",
    "thus , the cumulative density of the discrete variable @xmath22 under @xmath12 hypothesis is given by : @xmath39 and the global false alarm probability is given by : @xmath40 one of the properties of the regularized incomplete beta function is the _ symmetry property _ [ 13 , eq .",
    "6.6.3 ] : @xmath41 applying this property to equation ( 9 ) : @xmath42 and by using the _ inverse regularized beta function _ , we can obtain the local false alarm probability by setting @xmath27 = @xmath33 : @xmath43 the regularized beta function and its inverse are implemented with low complexity algorithms in mathematical software tools like matlab and mathematica .",
    "the same algorithms can be implemented at the su recievers .",
    "similarly , the global detection probability is given by : @xmath44 before presenting the proposed neyman - pearson algorithm , we construct some auxiliary mathematical tools .",
    "we define the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 as : @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the inverse function given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the _ inverse incomplete gamma _ function .",
    "we can rewrite the global false alarm probability and local threshold in terms of the @xmath51 function by combining equation ( 3 ) with equation ( 10 ) : @xmath52 @xmath53 note that equation ( 15 ) is a single equation in two unknowns @xmath31 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , there is an infinte number of @xmath54 pairs that solve ( 15 ) .",
    "we search for the pair that maximizes the expression in ( 12 ) .",
    "the global detection probability @xmath55 is a log - concave function of the global threshold @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the global and local threshold pair @xmath56 is obtained by solving the convex optimization problem : @xmath57 and @xmath58    our objective is to prove that the global detection probability in equation ( 12 ) is a log - concave function of @xmath31 .",
    "hence , taking the negative of its natural logarithm leads to a straight forward convex optimization problem . note that the regularized incomplete beta function can be written in terms of the _ gauss hypergeometric function _ @xmath59 as [ 14 , eq .",
    "8.392 ] : @xmath60 furthermore , the beta function can be obtained in terms of the gamma function as in [ 14 , eq .",
    "8.384.1 ] which yields : @xmath61 by replacing the gauss hypergeometric function by the equivalent series representation [ 15 , eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is _",
    "pochhammer s symbol _ , which can be represented by @xmath64 [ 15 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] . by simplifying the above expression using the gamma function representation of the pochhammer symbols ,",
    "the function @xmath65 becomes : @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 thus , the global detection probability is composed of @xmath69 terms that are summed over @xmath70 .",
    "every @xmath69 term is proportional ( within a positive scale ) to the product of the terms @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 as depicted by equation ( 18 ) .",
    "we start by studying the behavior of each @xmath75 term individually .    *",
    "* log - concavity of @xmath71 * + in order to prove the log - concavity of pochhammer s symbol @xmath76 , we take the natural logarithm of the gamma function representation of @xmath71 as : @xmath77 applying the second derevative test , we get : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the _ first order polygamma _ function [ 13 , eq .",
    "based on the property @xmath80 [ 13 , eq .",
    "6.4.6 ] , we conclude that @xmath81 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is always negative and the function @xmath71 is log - concave . * * log - concavity of @xmath72 and @xmath73 * + the second derevative test for @xmath72 is given by : @xmath83 which is always negative as @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the second derevative test shows the log - concavity of @xmath72 .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to @xmath73 .",

    "thus , @xmath89 is a log - concave function of @xmath16 . by discretization of the integral defining @xmath74 , we obtain + @xmath90 + because the terms @xmath91 in the summation are all positive , and the terms @xmath92 are all log - concave in @xmath16 , thus @xmath74 is the sum of positive scaled log - concave functions , which means that @xmath74 is also a log - concave function .",
    "based on the above discussion , we conclude that the function @xmath69 is a product of log - concave functions . as the product and addition operations preserve log - concavity [ 17 ] , @xmath69 and @xmath55 are both log - concave on all positive values of @xmath31 .",
    "because @xmath55 is a log - concave function of @xmath31 , we can obtain the global threshold by minimization of the convex function @xmath93 .    to sum up",
    ", a cognitive radio user needs to perform a simple two step algorithm in order to obtain the optimal thresholds . given @xmath20 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and assuming that @xmath1 is odd",

    "+ the optimization of the objective function is a done using a simple binary search approach .",
    "the feasibility of binary search is due to the convexity of the set of points representing the discrete objective function @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the algorithm has a complexity of @xmath0 , and it scales logarithmically with the number of cooperating users . because we are mainly concerned with dense networks , the logarithmic complexity is appreciated .",
    "this would be appreciated by cr reciever designers as threshold optimization has to be done every time the listening or reporting channels change [ 12 ] .",
    "figures 2 depicts the impact of the number of cooperating users and snr on @xmath55 for a false alarm probability of 0.01 .",
    "it is shown that as more users cooperate , the detection probability improves .",
    "it is found that an or - rule would be optimal for the case of @xmath1 = 4 case .",
    "however , as @xmath1 increases , the maximum detection probability becomes interior to the range @xmath107 .",
    "figure 3 depicts the convexity of the objective function @xmath108 at @xmath1 = 32 .",
    "it is shown that increasing snr will normally lead to an enhanced detection performance .",
    "in this section , we aim at characterizing the performance of the proposed globally optimal algorithm .",
    "the optimal fusion rule employs the thresholds calculated via the optimization problem in ( 17 ) .",
    "we first verify the accuracy of the analytic model adopted in our work . in figure 4 ,",
    "the simulated detection probability is plotted versus snr and compared with the numerical results obtained from equation ( 12 ) .",
    "it is shown that both results nearly coincide . in order to verify the optimality of the proposed algorithm , a comparison is done between the optimal rule and the conventional and , or and majority rules in figure 5 . in all simulations",
    ", we set @xmath109 = 0.01 .",
    "it is shown that for n = 16 , the optimal rule offers 1 db snr gain over the or - rule and 1.5 db gain over majority rule .",
    "the optimal scheme significantly outperforms the and rule scheme .",
    "moreover , the impact of the number of sensing samples @xmath2 ( or equivalently , the sensing time ) is demonstrated in figure 6 . at an snr of -2 db and",
    "n = 16 , we plot the global detection probability for @xmath2 = 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 .",
    "it is shown that the maximum detection probability is significantly boosted from more than 0.6 at @xmath2 = 6 to more than 0.9 at @xmath2 = 18 .",
    "this boost in detection probability comes on the expense of sensing delay .",
    "figure 7 translates this detection probability boost into an snr gain for the same number of cooperating users ( @xmath1 = 16 ) .",
    "it is found that increasing the number of sensing samples from 6 to 24 can offer up to a 4 db snr gain .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the proposed scheme offers significant gain only in networks with large number of cooperating users . as demonstrated by figure 8 , when n = 8 , the or - rule and the optimal fusion rule have nearly equal performance .",
    "the attained snr gain is only significant when the number of cooperating users increase to n = 16 and 32 . the snr gain attained in both cases are 1 db and 2 db respectively .",
    "thus , the proposed scheme would be appreciated in dense cooperative networks .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a globally optimal hard decisions fusion scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing .",
    "this problem has been always known for being complex and mathematically intractable .",
    "we have proved that the optimal local and global neyman - pearson thresholds can be obtained by a simple convex optimization problem .",
    "this is achieved by utilizing the mathematical representation of the global detection and false alarm probabilities in terms of a regularized incomplete beta function .",
    "the log - concavity of global detection probability as a function of the global threshold paves the way for constructing a convex objective function .",
    "the proposed algorithm has a complexity of @xmath0 .",
    "simulation results verify the optimality of the proposed scheme .",
    "it is shown that the globally optimal scheme offers significant gain only when the number of cooperating users is large .",
