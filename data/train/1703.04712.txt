    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary stars where a roche - lobe filling late - type component ( the secondary ) transfers matter via an accretion disk to a white dwarf primary",
    ". it may be surprising that even after decades of intense studies of cvs there are still an appreciable number of known or suspected systems , bright enough to be easily observed with comparatively small telescopes , which have not been studied sufficiently for basic parameters to be known with certainty .",
    "in some cases even their very class membership still requires confirmation .",
    "therefore , a small observing project aimed at a better understanding of these stars was initiated in 2014 at the observatrio do pico dos dias ( opd ) , operated by the laboratrio nacional de astrofsica , brazil , using 60 cm class telescopes .",
    "first results have been published by bruch ( 2016 , 2017 ) and bruch & diaz ( 2017 ) . here , we present time resolved photometry of the long period dwarf nova gy  hya in order to characterize orbital modulations .",
    "hoffmeister ( 1963 ) classified gy  hya as either a rr  lyr or u  gem star . describing spectroscopic observations , bond & tifft ( 1974 )",
    "reject the first alternative and consider the u  gem classification as probably correct .",
    "this is supported by the spectrum reproduced by zwitter & munari ( 1996 ) which shows the balmer series strongly in emission .",
    "he  i lines are also present . as an indication for the secondary star , the na  d lines are clearly visible in absorption . however , unlike normally seen in quiescent dwarf novae , the he  ii @xmath0  4686   emission line ( and the adjacent niii - oiii complex ) is particularly strong .",
    "this is more typically the hallmark of magnetic cataclysmic variables , some novalike variables and novae in quiescence ( see e.g. williams 1983 ) . but",
    "cropper ( 1986 ) did not find the light of gy  hya to be significantly polarized .",
    "the presence of the secondary star in the spectrum was confirmed by means of time resolved spectroscopy performed by peters & thorstensen ( 2005 ) who measured the orbital period to be 0.347237 days . quoting a private communication from one of us ( b. monard ) they also mention the presence of eclipses with the same period in the light curve .",

    ".  [ ephemeris ] ) has been chosen as phase 0 . since in 2005",
    "gy  hya was observed only in one night , not covering all phases , these data are not regarded here .",
    "moreover , the light curve on 2004 , may 13 was not used because the star was in a brighter state at this epoch ( see sect .",
    "[ gy hya outburst light curve ] ) .    in general terms",
    ", the orbital light curve is characterized by two strongly expressed minima and maxima .",
    "the secondary minimum close to phase 0.5 is  depending on the epoch  almost as deep as the primary minimum , while the maximum after the primary minimum is slightly fainter than that after the secondary minimum .",
    "however , there are differences from epoch to epoch .",
    "this is most evident comparing the year 2004 ( blue curve in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - fold ] ) , when both minima were of equal depth and both maxima of equal height , with 2016 ( black curve ) , when the strongest differences of both , the minima and the maxima , are observed and the primary minimum is deepest . in 2014",
    "the secondary minimum reached almost the depth of the primary minimum in 2016 .",
    "unfortunately , the primary minimum was not covered in that year .      the spectroscopic period measured by peters & thorstensen ( 2005 ) and",
    "the photometric period quoted by them rely on a comparatively short time base .",
    "combining the new observations of 2014 and 2016 with the those of 2002  2005 enlarges significantly the time base for the precise determination of the orbital period . instead of measuring individual eclipse times a representative minimum epoch for each observing season",
    "was derived from the average orbital light curves of each year . only for 2005 , with just one partial light curve available , the minimum epoch was measured directly .",
    "to best determine the location of the bottom of the eclipse , polynomials of various degrees ( between 2  5 ) and a gaussian were fitted to the eclipse profile and the epoch of the respective extrema calculated .",
    "their mean values together with their standard deviations are listed in table  [ gy hya eclipse epochs ] .",
    "a linear least squares fit to these data yields the updated ephemeris :    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the cycle number .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are formal fit errors which may underestimate the true error .",
    "the distribution of data points within two restricted time intervals separated by more than a decade does not allow to determine a possible period derivative .",
    "therefore , only a linear ephemeries , i.e. , the average period over the total time base , is given .    .gy",
    "hya eclipse epochs [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      on 2004 , may 13/14 gy  hya was observed to be @xmath14 brighter than normal .",
    "the long - term aavso light curves shows that it has been at about the same brightness level for at least 3 days around this date .",
    "nine days later the normal quiescent level is reached again .",
    "although the sparse data do not permit to say if the late phase of a genuine dwarf nova outburst has been observed , for simplicity we will subsequently refer to this high state as an outburst .",
    "the shape of the outburst orbital light curve , shown in black in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - outburstlc ] , is drastically different from the average ( quiescent state ) curve during the other observing nights of the same year , shown in red in the figure .",
    "while the bottom of the primary minimum ( the eclipse ) attains the same magnitude in both states the amplitude of the eclipse is much larger during outburst .",
    "the width of the eclipse in both states , indicated by the broken vertical lines in the figure , is very similar ( @xmath15 ) ; at most the eclipse may start slightly earlier during outburst .",
    "it is `` v''-shaped in outburst but flat bottomed during quiescence .",
    "the secondary minimum near phase 0.5 is still apparent during outburst , but it is much shallower .",
    "we measured its depth after transforming the light curves from magnitudes to intensities ( on an arbitrary scale ) . during quiescence",
    ", its amplitude is taken to be the difference between the maxima on either side and the minimum . during outburst ,",
    "when gy  hya does not attain the same light level after the secondary minimum that it had before , a third order polynomial fit to the the phase ranges 0.12  0.41 and 0.7  0.89 was first subtracted before determining the intensity difference .",
    "the amplitude of the secondary minimum during outburst is then found to be 36% of the amplitude during quiescence .",
    "at the long orbital period of @xmath16  @xmath17 the secondary star of gh  hya is expected to contribute significantly to the total light ; more than the relatively faint absorption lines in the spectrum shown by zwitter & munari ( 1996 ) would suggest .",
    "but then , their observations were made when the system was at @xmath18 , more than half a magnitude above its normal quiescent brightness .",
    "on the other hand , during the observations of peters & thorstensen ( 2005 ) the spectrum was dominated by strong absorption lines of spectral type k4 or k5 .",
    "the orbital variations of gy  hya documented here confirm that much of the system light in the optical band comes from the secondary star .",
    "they can be interpreted as ellipsoidal variations of the mass donor in gy  hya in combination with eclipses of both system components . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ gyhya - fold ] , the shape of the variations changes from season to season .",
    "while the maximum at phase 0.25 remains fairly stable this is not the case for the second maximum .",
    "qualitatively , this can be explained by a variable contribution of a hot spot which hides behind the disk at phases close to 0.25 but is in plain sight during the second maximum .",
    "such variations may either be caused by a real time dependence of its brightness , or by a variable contribution of the hot spot in the different photometric bands , or both . moreover , the depth of the minima ( eclipses ) changes considerably . since",
    "this is seen in both , the opd and the cba data , this can not be explained as being due to the different passbands . instead , disk radius variations may be invoked .",
    "if the eclipses are partial  as is strongly suggested by their shape  the more concentrated light from a smaller disk would lead to deeper eclipses at primary minimum ( phase 0 , when the secondary star is in front ) unless only the outer parts of the disk are eclipsed .",
    "the secondary minimum should be shallower because a smaller part of the mass donor is eclipsed .",
    "the ellipsoidal variations of gy  hya provide a handle to put ( albeit only weak ) constrains on the mass ratio @xmath19 and the orbital inclination @xmath20 .",
    "the wilson - devinney ( wilson & devinney 1971 , wilson 1979 ) code was used to calculate @xmath7 band light curves of a roche - lobe filling star with a temperature of 4130  k , appropriate for a k5 main sequence star ( allen 1973 ) , as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , fixing the limb and gravity darkening coefficients to values interpolated in the tables of claret & bloemen ( 2011 ) .",
    "the albedo is irrelevant because no illumination of the star is assumed . the total amplitude @xmath21 of the resulting ellipsoidal variations is plotted in fig .  [ gyhya - ellip ]",
    "( upper frame ) .",
    "it is colour coded as specified on the colour bar at the right of the figure .",
    "the 2004 light curve of gy  hya , being the most symmetrical of all with almost equal maxima , appears to be least distorted by variable contributions of other light sources around the orbit . for convenience ,",
    "it is included in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ellip ] ( lower frame ) .",
    "the onset and end of the secondary eclipse ( phase 0.5 ) can be clearly identified .",
    "the corresponding magnitude level is marked by a red horizontal line in the figure .",
    "the second horizontal line marks the maximum magnitude level .",
    "taking into account that the contribution of other light sources to the total brightness will reduce the observed amplitude , the difference @xmath22 between these lines is then a firm lower limit for @xmath21 of the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star .",
    "it is shown as a brown curve in the upper frame of the figure which separates the permitted @xmath23 combinations in the upper right part from combinations which would lead to too small an amplitude for the ellipsoidal variations .    assuming the radius @xmath24 of the accretion disk ( taken to be flat and infinitesimally thin ) to be known , roche geometry and the last contact phase of the disk eclipse provide a functional relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the last contact is quite well defined in the light curve .",
    "it occurs at phase 0.074 ( blue vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ellip ] , lower frame ) . in quiescent dwarf novae @xmath25 [ in units of the component separation",
    "; e.g.  oy  car : 0.31 ( wood et al .",
    "1989 ) ; z  cha : 0.33 ( wood et al .  1986 ) ; v2051  oph : 0.32 ( baptista et al .",
    "2007 ) ; v4104  sgr : 0.28 ( borges & baptista 2005 ) ] . adopting this value we numerically derived the @xmath23 relationship which is shown as a violet line in the upper frame of the figure .    for all values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the observed outer contact phase together with @xmath27 leads to a configuration such that the central parts of the disk remain uneclipsed . for @xmath28",
    "only a small part of the outer disk is invisible at mid - eclipse .",
    "this is hardly compatible with the observed eclipse depth .",
    "moreover , the eclipse depth during outburst ( sect .",
    "[ gy hya outburst light curve ] ) should then not reach the same low level seen in quiescence because the central parts of the then bright accretion disk would remain visible .",
    "therefore , in order to assess the effect of a smaller disk radius , we also calculated the @xmath23 relation for @xmath29 which is shown as a light blue line in the figure .",
    "we remark that for this disk radius the centre of the primary is eclipsed for all @xmath19 and the disk eclipse is total for @xmath30 .",
    "the strong ellipsoidal variations attest to the dominant contribution of the secondary star to the total light .",
    "an upper limit to the relative contribution of the primary component ( @xmath31 , expressed in units of the secondary contribution @xmath32 at orbital maximum ) can be calculated as a function of the intrinsic amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations ( @xmath21 ) from their observed amplitude ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "for @xmath21 between the maximum value in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ellip ] and a value just above its permitted minimum value @xmath33 the contribution of the primary must remain below the back line in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ecldepth ] ( left hand scale ) .    is this compatible with the observed primary eclipse depth @xmath34 ? yes , it is . assuming the eclipse to be total , an upper limit for @xmath34 can be calculated from @xmath32 , @xmath21 and the upper limit to @xmath31",
    "this is shown as a red line in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ecldepth ] ( right hand scale ) .",
    "the observed primary eclipse depth can be estimated from the magnitude difference at mid - eclipse and the end of eclipse egress in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ellip ] to be not more than @xmath35 ( difference between the yellow horizontal lines ) .",
    "this is an upper limit because due to its ellipsoidal variations the secondary contributes less at mid - eclipse than at the end of egress .",
    "@xmath34 is shown as a broken line in fig .",
    "[ gyhya - ecldepth ] . obviously , the observed eclipse depth is significantly smaller than than the calculated upper limit for all but the smallest values of @xmath21 .",
    "while the above considerations lead to a consistent picture of gy  hya a problem arises when regarding some low points which appear in the long term light curve ( fig .",
    "[ gyhya - aavso ] ) . even for",
    "the maximum upper limit of @xmath31 ( referring to the maximum of value of @xmath21 considered here ) the brightness of the system can not decrease by more than @xmath2@xmath36 even under the extreme assumption that the primary star contribution drops to zero .",
    "how can gy  hya then attain a magnitude as faint as @xmath37 ?",
    "most of the low points are concentrated in a small time interval between 2001 , april 27 and june 27 and were observed by the same observer ( who did not contribute any other data ) . moreover , at least on two occasions other observers found the system to be at a `` normal '' magnitude just two days before or after a faint observation .",
    "the one remaining low point at jd 2452842 is the only data point provided by another observer .",
    "this may cast doubts on the reliability of the faint data points .",
    "we present the first time resolved photometry of the cv gy  hya .",
    "its overall behaviour is as expected from a dwarf nova with a long orbital period .",
    "the light curve is characterized by strong orbital modulations in quiescence caused by ellipsoidal variations of the dominant mass donor star together with eclipses of both system components . as is normal in cataclysmic variables ,",
    "flickering is present but on a magnitude scale significantly smaller than in most quiescent dwarf novae ( beckemper 1995 ) because the flickering light source , expected to be associated to the accretion disk , is outshone by the brighter secondary star .",
