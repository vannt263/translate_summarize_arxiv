    "disorder leads to important physical effects which are of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "this has been revealed by anderson @xcite in the study of a disordered tight - binding model .",
    "this problem has attracted great attention over many decades .",
    "a breakthrough came with the scaling theory of localization @xcite .",
    "all states in a one - dimensional system ( 1-d ) are localized , whereas in 3-d a metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "an analytic solution is only known for the 1-d problem @xcite .",
    "although there was no general analytical solution available , there was consensus that in 2-d all states are localized .",
    "for quite some time after the advent of the scaling theory , many believed it to be essentially under control .",
    "this view is less secure nowadays , in part because recent experiments have challenged conventional wisdom about disordered 2-d systems .",
    "the 2-d case still presents a problem which has become apparent by experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments are still being discussed controversially .",
    "experimental reality is certainly more complex than a simple tight - binding model , but these results provide a good reason for revisiting this classic theoretical problem .",
    "recently we have been able to solve the 2-d case analytically @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in principle there is the possibility that the phase of delocalized states exists for a _ non - interacting electron system_. for energies and disorder , where extended states may exist we find a coexistence of these localized and extended states .",
    "thus the anderson metal - insulator transition exists and should be regarded as a first order phase transition .",
    "consequently we have returned to the old idea of mott @xcite that the metal - insulator transition is discontinuous .",
    "this alternative idea was in its history completely abandoned with the advent of the scaling theory of localization .",
    "there is now a renaissance of it .",
    "this result implies the failure of the scaling theory of anderson localization .",
    "although this paper is published @xcite and constitutes the basis for a new analytical investigation of the anderson problem in the present paper for the case of higher dimensions ( n - d problem ) one has to accept the following : ( i ) the paper @xcite requires an independent confirmation , which requires a certain time ; ( ii ) in the history of the problem one has developed quite a few conceptions and this leads to a critical attitude towards the new theory - i.e. there is a resistance - as it departs from conventional wisdom .",
    "this asks for a critical evaluation of the new theory and its results .",
    "one should acknowledge that the problem is many - sided and quite complex .",
    "thus logical errors are possible which do not lie at the surface .",
    "perhaps a reference to b. pascal is appropriate here : _",
    "a truth is so delicate that any small deviation from it leads you to a mistake , but this mistake is also so delicate that after a small retreat you find yourselves in a truth again . _ without an exact analytic solution any discussion can not lead to firm results .",
    "the main aim of the present article is thus the generalization of the mathematical tools of the previous article@xcite to the case of higher dimensional spaces and a physical interpretation of the new results .",
    "the outline of the present article is a follows . in chapter 2",
    "we give a short derivation of equations for n - d anderson localization problem , and necessary summary of the results of the article @xcite .",
    "the connection between the anderson localization problem and signal theory is discussed and the most important concept of the proposed methode - the filter @xmath5 - is defined .",
    "to understand fully these aspects of the theory a knowledge of the first paper @xcite is recommended .",
    "the filter @xmath5 is generalized for higher dimensions d of the space .",
    "the investigation of its properties and the corresponding physical interpretation constitute the content of several chapters . the theory for high - dimensional systems ( @xmath6 )",
    "is presented in chapter 3 , whereas the theory for low - dimensional systems is given in chapter 4 .",
    "an appendix deals with the mathematical conditions for the physical interpretation of the filter @xmath5 and a more detailed discussion of related aspects of the problem .",
    "recently we have been able to solve the 2-d case analytically @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding equation in 2-d is solved for the wave function @xmath7 and the second moments ( correlators ) @xmath8 : @xmath9 where the summation over @xmath10 runs over the nearest neighbours of site ( @xmath11 ) in layer @xmath12 that is in a space of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "we assume taking the limit to infinite size @xmath14 in @xmath15-space .",
    "the equation is solved with an initial condition @xmath16 the on - site potentials @xmath17 are independently and identically distributed with existing first two moments , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . after averaging the mean squared amplitude @xmath20 becomes independent of @xmath21 ( the averaging procedure that justifies this statement is discussed in detail in @xcite ) .    in the present paper we present the analytic solution for the general case @xmath22 .",
    "the knowledge of paper @xcite is prerequisite for understanding the present one as it contains the full formalism .",
    "the generalization of this formalism to the n - d case presents no problem ( see below ) . the main eqs .",
    "( [ recursion d]),([rand d ] ) remain valid , only scalar quantities become vector quantities .",
    "the tight - binding equation in @xmath23 dimension is ( primed indices are summed ) @xmath24 @xmath25 ( summation over @xmath26 runs over the nearest neighbours ) with initial condition @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "one introduces the correlators ( the averages are taken over disorder ) @xmath29 from the eq.([recursion dn ] ) one easily obtains the system of equations : @xmath30 they can be solved explicitly by introducing of the z - transform@xcite @xmath31 which turn the equations into @xmath32 iteration of the second equation yields @xmath33 we then obtain an equation for @xmath34 only , which can be solved by double fourier expansion . however , upon averaging over ensemble of initial conditions ( as described in section 3.2 of @xcite ) : averaging over translations in @xmath15-space of boundary conditions , @xmath35 ) such that @xmath36 , the problem is translation - invariant in transverse directions .",

    "in the theory of signals @xcite , @xmath51 ( or @xmath42 ) is the input signal , and @xmath46 ( or @xmath45 ) is the output .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of the solution is completely determined by the filter @xmath50 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the concept of the system function is a general and abstract description of the problem of localization .",
    "thus the filter function has to be analysed to obtain general results and not the multitude of signals .",
    "this has been done in @xcite for the 2-d case .",
    "this procedure has a certain similarity with the transition to an operator formalism in quantum mechanics .",
    "particular signals @xmath46 depend on the initial conditions used and do not carry much physical information because of the unconventional normalization @xcite .",
    "for the localization problem the only property that matters is whether a signal belongs to the bounded or unbounded class and this can be derived from the filter .",
    "the essence of localization is contained in the filter @xmath5 .",
    "we study the filter @xmath5 with properties described by generalized lyapunov exponents .",
    "the filter is a fundamental function of the disorder @xmath52 only @xcite .",
    "a filter @xmath50 is uniquely characterized by a pole - zero diagram of its image @xmath5 which is a plot of the locations of the poles @xmath53 and zeros of @xmath5 in the complex-@xmath54 plane .",
    "we provide just a brief summary here , for more details consult @xcite . the signals @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath46 are real , therefore @xmath5 will have poles and zeros that are either on the real axis , or come in conjugate pairs .",

    "physical considerations dictate that only _",
    "causal _ filters ( @xmath57 for @xmath58 ) should be considered .",
    "they have rocs outside a circle that intersects the pole with @xmath59 .",
    "a causal filter is _ stable _ ( bounded input yields a bounded output ) if the _ unit circle _ @xmath60 is in the roc .",
    "note that the explicit calculation of @xmath50 by the inverse @xmath55-transform is not necessary , and it is also not feasible analytically due to the complexity of the function @xmath5 .",
    "only the type of the filter  stable or unstable  needs to be determined .",
    "the delocalized states ( bounded output ) are obtained by transforming the physical solutions inside the band ( bounded input ) provided that the filter @xmath5 is stable .",
    "seeking for poles is quite a simple analytical task which gives rather general results by elementary methods .    as an example for the general and abstract description of the problem of localization as stated above let us consider the following problem .",
    "it is well - known that disorders broadens the band ; new states outside the old band arise for @xmath61 .",
    "are among these new states also extended states ?",
    "numerical work for @xmath62 @xcite ascertains this .",
    "this is the socalled reentrant behaviour of the mobility edge : the change from localized to extended states and back to localized ones upon increasing the disorder occurs for certain fixed energies . because in the literature there is no physical explanation for this phenomenon one has simply accepted these results without critically examining them .    with the help of signal theory we have found a particular transformation , which gives a connection between the states in an ideal system ( zero disorder ) and states in a system with disorder .",
    "extended states ( zero disorder ) as input ( bounded ) signal transform into localized states ( nonzero disorder ) as output ( unbounded ) signal if the filter which is responsible for this transformation is unstable .",
    "if the filter is stable , then extended states ( bounded input signal ) transform into extended states ( bounded output signal ) .",
    "it is known that for zero disorder i.e. outside the band , @xmath63 , there do exist only mathematical solutions which can not be normalized .",
    "these correspond to an unbounded input signal .",
    "it is impossible to find a filter which permits a transformation of the type unbounded input signal ( mathematical solution ) into a bounded output signal ( extended states in @xmath63 ) .",
    "the reverse - the transformation of an unbounded input signal ( mathematical solution ) into a unbounded output signal ( localized states in @xmath63 ) - is on the other hand possible .",
    "i.e. the mathematical procedure developed by us generates in this case a negative answer to the posed question .",
    "because this result contradicts the numerical work @xcite , it is necessary to discuss in detail the quality of the numerical work ( see below and appendix b ) .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the filter @xmath5 is a non - analytic function of the complex variable @xmath54 ; this result remains valid also in the multi - dimensional case .",
    "the unit circle @xmath60 divides the complex plane into two analytic domains : the interior and exterior of the unit circle .",
    "the inverse z - transform is quite generally defined via countour integrals in the complex plane @xmath64 and this definition is only possible in an analytic domain . in this way in the formal analysis of the problem",

    "the filter @xmath66 describes delocalized states .",

    "the second branch with the plus sign gives a mapping onto the half - plane with the half - circle excluded ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "therefore in the parametric @xmath74-representation @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "it is generally assumed that 2-d systems mark the borderline between high and low dimension @xcite .",
    "the existence of a transition in 3-d is not questioned ( high - dimensional systems ) .",
    "these assumptions , however , originate from the scaling theory of localization . here",
    "the marginal dimension is @xmath86 , and a phase transition exists only for @xmath87 .",
    "thus perturbation theory @xcite for @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is possible .",

    "on the one hand these statements referring to higher dimensions are numerically nearly impossible to ascertain @xcite . statistics is bad and the length of the system @xmath93 very small ( see appendix b ) . even for @xmath62 progress towards extracting reliable numerical estimates of critical quantities has been remarkably difficult @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the results from the scaling theory of localization for 2-d systems are faulty ( this is what we claim ) , then the corresponding division of the systems into low and high dimensional ones is also wrong . here",
    "one must develop an alternative picture .",
    "in the theory of critical phenomena @xcite many systems belong to a class , where an upper critical dimension @xmath94 has a totally different physical meaning .",
    "it denotes the dimension , from where on the mean field approximation is exact , or where with other words all critical exponents reach stationary values .",
    "i.e. in this case the phase transition does exist also for @xmath95 ; only in the limit @xmath96 the transition disappears , simply because the corresponding critical values have gone to infinity .",
    "systems of quite different physical nature may have the same value of the upper critical dimension @xmath94 .",
    "e.g. one finds @xmath97 not only for the theory of magnetism @xcite ( in this case there exists also the marginal dimension , below which no phase transition is possible ) , but also in kinetics ( cooperative phenomena in bimolecular processes by diffusion - controlled reactions ) @xcite ; in the latter case , however , there is no marginal dimension .",
    "another example is percolation , where the upper dimension is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "let us start first from a purely mathematical comment : the integral @xmath99 is always finite for all @xmath100 in the sector @xmath101 for high - dimensional systems with @xmath6 .",
    "this fact clearly follows from the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel function for large values of its argument , @xmath102 .",
    "we shall further on see that the dimensionality @xmath103 is critical for localization , although this is no proper upper critical dimension @xmath104 , which we shall determine below .",
    "let us consider therefore the properties of the filter - functions in this region of the value of the dimension of space .",
    "let us consider first the solution @xmath98 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the roc of the causal filter is defined by the inequality @xmath105 , where @xmath53 are the poles .",
    "the case when the system function has a pole at @xmath106 is the simplest one for an interpretation . in terms of signal theory @xcite the filter @xmath65 is unstable since the pole lies outside the unit circle @xmath60 in the complex @xmath54-plane .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such a filter describes exponentially localized states ( insulating phase ) . in order to see this",
    "one can exploit a basic inverse z - transform @xcite : @xmath107 therefore the pole of @xmath65 at @xmath108 leads to exponential growth of the system function @xmath50 which in turn implies [ eq .  ( [ xn0 ] ) ] an exponentially increasing mean squared amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "the growth exponent @xmath109 is the so - called generalized lyapunov exponent @xcite related to the localization length by @xmath110 .",
    "the value of the lyapunov exponent @xmath109 defines the phase .",
    "we start from the mathematical definition that all states with @xmath111 belong to the insulating phase . the states with @xmath112 on the other hand correspond to a metal .",
    "according to this definition the states with non - exponential localization also belong to the metallic phase , because they correspond to the value @xmath112",
    ". we can consider these states as a bad metal , in contrast to a good metal , where one has truly delocalized states .",
    "we would like to give here a summary of the results which emerge from an analysis of the pole diagram ( for details see the appendix a ) .",
    "the function @xmath99 defined by eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) is purely imaginary for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the system function @xmath65 itself is real .",
    "the pole must be located ( if present at all ) exactly in this region of the parameter @xmath74 .",
    "it can be found as a solution of an in general transcendental equation @xmath116 where @xmath117 ^{d-1 } \\cos(et ) \\sin ( u t)dt.\\ ] ] for high - dimensional systems with @xmath6 the function @xmath118 has a maximum at @xmath119 and decreases monotonically for @xmath120 .",
    "the system function has a pole if the disorder exceeds a critical value , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 therefore , in high - dimensional systems exponential localization takes place only if the disorder is strong enough .    for @xmath123",
    "the function @xmath65 has no poles , its roc its @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the unit circle @xmath60 belongs to the roc , and the filter is stable .",
    "we interpret solutions for this range of the disorder values , @xmath52 , also as localized , however with non - exponential localization ( which could be a power - law ) . here",
    "we encounter limits of applicability of the method , which come into play , however , only in physically inaccessible systems of high dimensionality .",
    "the elementary pole search can be applied only for exponentially localized states , the general case requires a detailed investigation of the filter .    the curve for @xmath124 ( fig.1a ) is the well - known mobility edge . for @xmath125 there exists an insulating phase , whereas for @xmath126 a metallic phase is found ( bad metal ) .",
    "a coexistence of phases is here not possible .",
    "thus the phase transition here has an appearance as if it were a transition of second order .",
    "this simple idea , however , is contradicted by the behaviour of the lyapunov exponent : the transition from @xmath112 to @xmath111 is not continuous .",
    "one can clearly see that all these mobility edges for high - dimensional systems show the same qualitative behaviour .",
    "now let us turn to the second branch of the solution , @xmath66 .",
    "in this case existence of the poles leads to principally different consequences .",
    "let us assume that the corresponding value of the parameter @xmath74 is found and the pole @xmath128 is located inside the unit circle , @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "formally , however , from the definition @xmath131 the same value of @xmath74 can be obtained for @xmath132 .",
    "the complex number @xmath133 lies outside the region of definition of the solution , @xmath134 . in this sense",
    "the pole at @xmath135 is virtual . for the inverse @xmath55-transform",
    "this fact is , however , irrelevant .",
    "the roc for a causal filter is defined by the inequality @xmath136 or @xmath137 .",
    "since the roc and the region of definition of the solution @xmath134 do not intersect , a physical solution is absent .",
    "therefore , the filter @xmath66 as a physical solution is acceptable only if either there are no poles or they lie on the unit circle .",
    "the latter case is realized for @xmath138 @xcite and corresponds to so called marginal stability @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we consider the general case @xmath6 from a unified point of view .",
    "a pole of the first type is related to the singularity of the function eq .",

    "we define the phase and amplitude via the integral ( [ y ] ) @xmath140 it is not difficult to show that this pole emerges at arbitrarily small disorder for a negative phase @xmath141 .",
    "the equation @xmath142 defines the boundary of the region @xmath143 , where the physical solution is absent and , therefore , any disorder transforms the delocalized states into localized ones . for high - dimensional systems the delocalized states transform into states with non - exponential localization .",

    "the behaviour of this curve @xmath150 ( fig.1b ) is determined by resonance phenomena .",
    "the integral in ( [ y ] ) consists asymptotically of a power function , @xmath151 , and a product of trigonometric functions .",
    "e.g. the function @xmath152 comes from every bessel function . if we represent this product as a sum of monochromatic waves , then we denote the existence of a wave with zero frequency as a resonance .",
    "for @xmath153 the first non - trivial resonance lies either at @xmath154 ( d=4,6 , ... ) or at @xmath155 ( d=5,7 , ... ) .",
    "for @xmath156 a pole of the second type appearing at higher levels of disorder @xmath157 must be considered .",

    "spaces of dimension @xmath164 possess a certain sensitivity with respect to the resonance phenomena mentioned above .",
    "for @xmath165 the line of the poles exhibits a deviation from purely imaginary values of the parameter @xmath74 and touches the real axis at the point @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "this point corresponds to the condition for the phase of the integral @xmath167 and also belongs to the unit circle ( marginal stability ) .",
    "the corresponding threshold disorder value we denote again as @xmath168 : @xmath169 we see that the function @xmath168 is in general singular in the energy . in going from the energy value @xmath170 to the value @xmath144 the parameter @xmath171 increases monotonically and reaches finally the value @xmath172 .",

    "@xmath174 there are no resonance phenomena .",
    "these resonances are so weak that only one equation ( [ om- ] ) remains valid in the whole range of energies @xmath148 .",
    "i. e. although @xmath90 is a certain critical dimension ( here non - exponential localization arises ) , a qualitative agreement of all results is only obrtained for @xmath174 .    in this way it emerges from our exact analytic theory that for anderson localization the upper critical dimension is @xmath4",
    ", i.e. the problem in a certain way shows a similarity to percolation @xcite - and this may not be totally unexpected .",
    "however , we also note that as a rough estimate for the upper critical dimension the value @xmath90 may also be accepted .",
    "it corresponds to a first and important step of the qualitative saturation of the results ( the possibility of existence of non - exponentially localized states ) , whereas a complete saturation only obtains at d=6 .    quite generally in the range @xmath148 and under the condition @xmath163 there exists a region of existence of stable delocalized states . because in this range also non - localized states coexist with the other ones , this means that in this range the good metal ( delocalized states ) and the bad metal ( non - exponentially localized states ) can form a heterogeneous system , whose properties depend on the relative proportions of the subsystems ; e.g. the bad metal , if the subsystem of non - exponentially localized states percolates .",
    "[ fig : 1 ] presents results of a numerical solution of the resulting equations .",
    "independently from whether @xmath90 or @xmath4 are taken as the upper critical dimension , it is necessary to consider 3-d systems as low dimensional ones .",
    "we approach here a widely held opinion that all states in @xmath62 should be stable against perturbations and should have a finite radius of convergence .",
    "this , however , is not correct and would only be valid if the whole field of the scaling theory of localization would be faultless .",
    "the eq.([om+ ] ) has always a solution for the physically important cases @xmath175 .",
    "we refer to these cases as low - dimensional ones . for the low - dimensional systems the integral eq .",

    "therefore , even infinitesimal disorder leads to solutions with exponential localization .",
    "because the curve @xmath124 forms the border between exponentially localized and non - exponentialy localized states , this simply means that in this model for low - dimensional systems non - exponentially localized states are impossible ( see , however , a discussion below ) .    for such systems",

    "if the corresponding mathematics sees no phase transition of second order ( and this is the case in two - dimensions ) , then this is no clear proof for the nonexistence of the phase transition .    for two - dimensions",
    "there exists a typical single - parameter scaling function , whose behaviour one commonly interprets as complete localization @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that for phase transitions of first order the identical single - parameter scaling function as in @xcite has a totally different physical interpretation , it only describes the behaviour of the insulating phase .",
    "i.e. in this case not the numbers which the numerical works provides should be doubted but their physical interpretation .",
    "numerical scaling is not capable of analysing a system consisting of two phases . scaling theory of localization",
    "predicts instead that the metal - insulator transition is a continuous one in 3-d , and that all states are localized in 2-d . in this way",
    "a logical circle has been constructed .",
    "scaling theory of localization claims that for the anderson model only phase transitions of second order are possible or none .",
    "finite - size scaling theory only checks this idea and interprets any deviation from a phase transition of second order as the nonexistence of the phase transition .",
    "measurements of coherent transport in mesoscopic disordered systems showed large statistical fluctuations and the non - self - averaging nature of the transport coefficients such as the conductance , @xmath307 .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as universal conductance fluctuation @xcite .",
    "the physical quantities are broadly distributed .",
    "it is generally accepted that a description of this system requires distribution functions of the respective quantities @xcite .    in the article @xcite",
    "one has assumed that the full averaging ( @xmath310 ) over different realizations of disorder can be replaced by one realization of disorder ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "today one is not quite sure about this any more and one does an averaging for @xmath312 , e.g. @xmath313 in @xcite .",
    "i.e. there exists the claim that a very small number of realizations shows the full properties of the complete statistics .",
    "this claim can obviously not be proved and detailed numerical investigations @xcite show clearly that the averaged values always exhibit a certain distribution .",
    "verification of the scaling theory of localization via the conductance distribution requires a large statistical ensemble @xmath314 . in practice , however , the quality of the statistics is determined by the value of the product @xmath315 , which in numerical investigations is in its magnitude a constant depending on the computer .",
    "we should not forget in this context that we are dealing here with the statistics corresponding to a phase transition .",
    "it is well - known @xcite , that if one replaces in the statistics of a phase transition a statistical sum by the _ maximal _",
    "term , then this procedure corresponds to an approximation - the mean field approximation . because mean field theories are only correct for higher dimensions @xmath316 , the results look qualitatively as if one would have artificially increased the dimension @xmath216 .",
    "the replacement of the statistical sum by a small number of rather arbitrary terms is meaningless and produces no physical results .",
    "the best one can say about this numerical method in the anderson localization problem is that it possibly considers some mean field model .",
    "this discussion , however , is not fully sufficient .",
    "it does not suffice to assume that a probability distribution exists .",
    "it is more important to find out how this probability distribution arises physically .",
    "only then can one detect , what physical importance this probability distribution possesses .",
    "universal conductance fluctuation is really a finger - print of the critical phenomenon , but does not fit into the generally accepted picture that the localization - delocalization transition is of second order .",
    "phase transitions of second order do not require a description via a probability distribution , although the fluctuations at critical point are very strong and their role is well understood . if the physical origin of such fluctuations remains uncertain , then their formal description is also uncertain .",
    "there exists for the present case an experimental result which can play a decisive role .",
    "ilani et al.@xcite have studied via direct electrostatic probing the spatial structure at the metal - insulator transition in two dimensions .",
    "they found a coexistence of localized and metallic regions associated with 2-d mit .",
    "optical investigations suggest that the 2-d electron system becomes strongly inhomogeneous : coexistence of two lines in photoluminescence spectra , one of which is caused from metallic regions and the other proves the existence of insulating islands in the electron system @xcite .    from the point of view of the theory of second order phase transitions",
    "this phenomenon is quite ununderstandable , but it has a very simple explanation in the framework of the theory of first order phase transitions .",
    "we are dealing here with a phase coexistence , where the relative proportions of the two phases varies .",
    "then the universal conductance fluctuations are nothing else but a direct consequence of the existence of fluctuations in the heterogeneous phase .",
    "because the transport properties are connected with percolation and their possibility depends strongly on the proportions of the two phases and their respective spatial distributions , it is clear that for different realizations of a static disorder potential the conductance of an otherwise identical mesoscopic conductor will significantly differ .",
    "the phenomenon of phase separation which originates from the existence of a first order phase transition in the 2-d electron system was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is certain that in the case of a phase transition of first order the description of heterogeneous fluctuations via probability distributions is formally possible .",
    "whether these distributions have a clear physical interpretation is another question .",
    "this is actually a weak point in the finite - size scaling procedure @xcite , because we have shown in @xcite that in systems with a phase transition of first order mean values are always not self - averaging quantities .",
    "true self - averaging quantities are not only those which do not fluctuate within the statistical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit , but they should also have a physical meaning , and this is not the case for first order phase transitions . in this case a formal averaging over the statistical ensemble also takes into consideration an averaging over the phases , and the resulting averages have no physical meaning .",
