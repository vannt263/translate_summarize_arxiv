    "chemical elements appear in the universe as a consequence of three production scenarios : 1 ) big bang nucleosynthesis ; 2 ) fragmentation processes ( cosmic rays ) ; and 3 ) stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "h disappears at the same time that metals ( elements heavier than he ) increase their abundances .",
    "elements are created , eventually ejected and diluted by the interstellar medium , and ultimately incorporated into successive generations of stars .",
    "if the process of star formation occurs rapidly , then the increase of the elemental abundances is also rapid ; if it is slow , the abundances also increase slowly . in this way",
    ", abundance patterns give clues regarding star formation : when , how , and with which rate , stars form .",
    "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models try to explain how and when the elements appear based upon some hypothesis @xcite . in the process of understanding the creation and evolution of the elements , we might compare model predictions with data and deduce the evolutionary histories of galaxies .",
    "one of the best known features of spiral galaxies is the existence of a radial gradient of abundances in their disks @xcite .",
    "this gradient was first observed in the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) and then in other external galaxies @xcite , and it is now well characterized in our local universe @xcite .",
    "the radial gradient was interpreted as due to differences in the star formation rate or the gas infall rate along the disk , although other reasons are also possible see @xcite for a detailed review. in order to understand the role of the involved processes , numerical chemical evolution models were early developed @xcite .",
    "most of these models were able to reproduce the present state of our galaxy , however not all of them predict the same evolution with time .",
    "for example , models from @xcite predict an initially flat radial distribution , which then steepens with time .",
    "conversely , models by @xcite possess a steep initial radial abundance gradient which flattens with time .",
    "the first scenario is the consequence of the existence of the disk before starting the evolution ( i.e. , initial conditions ) , combined with an infall of primordial gas which dilutes the metal enrichment of the disk , preferentially in the outer regions . in the second scenario , however , the infall of gas forms out the disk and , furthermore , it contributes to the metal budget because the infalling gas is not primordial : there is also star formation in the halo before the gas falls onto the disk .",
    "therefore , it seems that the radial gradient of abundances , observed in spirals is dependent upon the scenario of formation and evolution of the disk see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in fact , as @xcite explained , the radial gradient may be only modified by inflows or outflows of gas , and , besides the possible variations of the initial mass function ( imf ) or stellar yields along the galactocentric radius , the only way to change a radial gradient of abundances is to have a star formation rate ( sfr ) or an infall rate changing with galactocentric radius .",
    "most of models able to reproduce the present state of the solar neighborhood and the galactic disk as a whole follow one of two trends : a ) the gradient is steep , and then it flattens with time @xcite , or , b ) it is flat initially and it then steepens with time @xcite .",
    "besides this question of the scenario for each chemical evolution model , radial flows of gas or stellar migration may also modify , flattening , the radial distributions of abundances for stars of different ages see @xcite for a review about this subject .    from an observational perspective , the question of appropriate datasets against which to compare has been debated vigorously . in @xcite we compared the chemical evolution results with two types of observational data : planetary nebulae ( pne ) of different masses ( that is , different ages ) to oxygen abundance radial distributions at different times , and open and globular clusters , to estimate the global metallicity in objects of different ages .",
    "the problem with pne is that to estimate their galactocentric distances and their stellar masses ( and , therefore , their ages ) is a process with large uncertainties .",
    "the open cluster age determination , in turn , is not an easy task , too , although the error bars are smaller in this case .",
    "however the box enclosing the data corresponding to these objects basically falls in the same region of the young stars in a plot of [ fe / h ] _ vs _ radius . in the end , the most accurate date are those of globular clusters , and based mainly on their metallicities , we reached the conclusion that our models with a flattening of the radial gradient of abundances were good enough to reproduce the observational data .",
    "this situation has changed , however , in the light of the new observational results of stellar metallicities and of the pne determinations of age and distance , as we will show later .",
    "radial distributions of : a ) the total mass ; and b ) the mass enclosed in each radial region .",
    "different lines correspond to different virial mass values , as labelled .",
    "taken from @xcite . ]",
    "we , therefore , think that it is time to revise this question of the evolution of the radial gradient of abundances .",
    "to do so , we have generated a new suite of chemical evolution models for which we have revised all the necessary inputs for our code .",
    "here , we will analyze the results corresponding to a milky way galaxy ( mwg ) like model .",
    "in a chemical evolution model , a scenario is assumed in which there is a given mass of gas in a certain geometric region .",
    "this mass is converted to stars by following an assumed star formation law .",
    "a mass ejection rate appears as a consequence of the death of stars .",
    "often , some hypothesis concerning gas infall and outflows are included .",
    "the ejected mass depends , therefore , on the remnant of each stellar mass , on the mean - lifetimes of stars and on the imf employed .",
    "this suite of models , based on @xcite , are an update of those from @xcite , hereinafter md05 .",
    "we start with a mass in a proto - halo which is calculated from @xcite .",
    "we have computed 16 radial distributions within a range of virial masses @xmath0m_{\\odot}$ ] , which implies maximum rotation velocities in the range @xmath1 $ ] kms@xmath2 and leads to disks with total masses in the range @xmath3m_{\\odot}$ ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ dis ] the radial distributions we have obtained for various virial masses , as labelled .",
    "shaping the predicted radial abundance patterns are also the : 1 ) stellar yields ( with the corresponding mean - lifetimes of stars ) and the imf ; 2 ) infall rate of gas over the disk , and 3 ) star formation law , as outlined next .",
    "radial distributions of surface density of : a ) diffuse gas , hi ; b ) molecular gas , h@xmath4 ; c ) stars and d ) sfr .",
    "different lines correspond to different imf @xmath5 stellar yields combinations .",
    "dots with error bars are the data for mwg . taken from @xcite . ]",
    "we have divided , as usual , the stellar masses into two ranges corresponding to low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath6 ) , and massive stars ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the first eject mainly he@xmath8 , c@xmath9 and @xmath10 ; a small amount of o can be generated in some yield prescriptions , as well as various s - process isotopes .",
    "massive stars , in turn , produce c , o , and all the so - called @xmath11-elements , up to fe .",
    "the literature of stellar yield generation is a rich one , with various works differing from one another due to the intrinsically different input physics to the underlying stellar models .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to deconvolve these stellar yields with the imf .",
    "again , there are in the literature a certain number of different expressions to define this imf .",
    "therefore , we have addressed this question in a work described in @xcite . there",
    "we have computed a chemical evolution model for mwg by using 6 different stellar yields for massive stars , 4 different yields sets for low and intermediate mass stars , and 6 different imfs . analyzing these 144 permutations and comparing their results with the observational data for our galaxy disk",
    ", we determined which combinations are most valid in reproducing the data . following these results , the different imf @xmath5 stellar yields combinations",
    "produce basically the same radial distributions for gas ( diffuse and molecular ) , and stellar @xmath5 star formation surface densities , as shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "the corresponding radial distributions for the elemental abundances of c , n and o , as show in fig.[abun ] , left panel , are very different in their absolute values , with some far from the observational data , while others lie closer to the data .",
    "they do , however , show a similar slope for these radial distributions , suggesting that the selection of one or other combination is not particularly useful in modifying the radial abundance _ gradient . in any case , there only 8 combinations imf @xmath5 stellar yields able to reproduce the mwg data with a high probability ( @xmath12% ) .",
    "we use from here the yield combination given by @xcite and @xcite , with the imf of @xcite , which provides a good match to the data , as we show in fig.[abun ] , right panel . see more details in @xcite .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      in our scenario , the gas initially in the proto - halo falls to the equatorial plane where the disk forms . in our old md05 models",
    ", we assumed that this infall rate depends on the total mass of each galaxy , @xmath13 , through a collapse time - scale @xmath14 , defined by the expression @xmath15 , from @xcite .",
    "moreover , within the disk , and following the same idea as other authors , we had assumed that @xmath14 has a radial dependence , being shorter in the inner regions of the disk and longer in the outer ones .",
    "in fact , we used an exponential function to compute this time scale , at variance with other models where a linear relationship with radius was used .",
    "now , we profit from the new knowledge about the relationship between the halo mass and the corresponding mass of the associated disks to estimate which must be the infall rate from the halo to obtain the correct disk . by using the equation from @xcite : @xmath16=2.3\\,\\times 10^{10 } \\frac{\\left(m_{\\textrm{\\scriptsize vir}}/3.10^{11}\\ , { \\rm \\mbox{m}_{\\odot}}\\right)^{3.1}}{1+\\left(m_{\\textrm{\\scriptsize vir}}/3.10^{11}\\,{\\rm \\mbox{m}_{\\odot}}\\right)^{2.2 } } , \\label{shankar06}\\ ] ] it is possible to determine the appropriate final disk mass . from this expression and using the rotation curves and equations from @xcite , we obtain the radial distributions of mass in the proto - halo and in the disk in each geometrical region at a given galactocentric distance ; this is defined by a cylinder , as given in fig.[dis ] .",
    "from these masses we obtain the collapse time in each radius @xmath17 as : @xmath18\\ ] ]    the collapse time scale coming from this expression for a mwg - like model is smoother than the old exponential function used in md05 .",
    "the resulting infall rates produced by this collapse timescale are thus different than before : they show a smooth evolution for disks and stronger for bulges .",
    "the infall rates for different mass disks show variations only in the absolute values , with a very similar behavior for all galactic masses .",
    "the infall rate is very low in the outer regions of disk , and maintains that with redshift .",
    "this implies that the sfr is also low for all times . a sharp break in the disk",
    "is associated with the dramatic decline in star formation at a given radius .    when we compare these results with the ones coming from cosmological simulations we see that our older models possessed stronger evolution with time , appearing more similar to simulations associated with spheroids / early - types ; our newer models are more akin to simulations of late - type disks of the correct size and mass , as shown in figs . 3 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "the last of our ingredients refers to the sfr law .",
    "in the halo , we assume a schmidt law to form stars with an index @xmath19 . however , in the disc we assume that the sfr takes place in two steps : first , molecular clouds form from the diffuse gas",
    ". then stars form from cloud - cloud collision or by the interaction of the molecular clouds with massive stars .",
    "the first process in the halo depends on the volume with an efficiency taken as constant for all haloes .",
    "conversely , the second process is a local one and also assumed to possess a constant efficiency . in our older md05 models , we had assumed that the other two processes were dependent on the volume of the disk and on an efficiency considered to be a free parameter .",
    "both of these latter efficiencies , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for the cloud and star formation , respectively , were varied simultaneously through a number @xmath22 which defined the set ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . in this new grid of models",
    "we have included new prescriptions to form molecular gas from diffuse gas , thus eliminating the efficiency @xmath20 as a free parameter .",
    "finally only the efficiency @xmath21 remains as a free parameter .",
    "scheme of our bi - parametric suite of models . ]    with these inputs we have finally a bi - parametric suite of models , as shown in fig.[scheme ] , defined by the virial mass ( which implies the size of the disk and the collapse timescale ) and the efficiency to form stars @xmath21 .",
    "these models are valid for low mass galaxies as well as massive ones .",
    "the starburst or hii galaxies are included within the low mass and high efficiencies models , while low surface brightness galaxies will be among the more massive ones with low efficiencies .",
    "the mwg model corresponds to @xmath23 and an efficiency @xmath24 .",
    "one of the most important results derived from this work for our mwg model is the time evolution of the radial abundance gradient , in particular , for this work , oxygen . in fig.[oh ] , left panel , we represent the oxygen radial distribution , as @xmath25 _ vs _",
    "@xmath17 for 5 different values of redshifts ( see caption ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    this implies that a clear separation in data coming from hii regions and pne of 5 - 8gyr old will not be apparent , such as @xcite find .",
    "the second fact we see here is that the radial gradient is the same for all redshift , when we measure it within the optical radius ( which , obviously , decreases with increasing redshift ) .",
    "this way , for @xmath31 the radial gradient is the same as for @xmath26 when measured out only to @xmath32kpc instead of ( say ) out to 15 kpc as in the case for redshift @xmath33=0 .",
    "this is quite reasonable since beyond the optical radius there are few stars present to ionize the gas , and therefore deriving the gradient from the outer disk is not relevant for comparisons with empirical data .",
    "this fact is more clearly shown in the right panel of the same fig.[oh ] , where @xmath25 is represented as a function of the normalized radius @xmath30 .",
