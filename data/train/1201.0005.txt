    "consider a particular model of a discrete pregeometry . this is a directed dyadic acyclic graph .",
    "the edges are directed .",
    "each vertex possesses two incident incoming edges and two incident outgoing edges .",
    "a vertex with incident edges is called an x - structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the model was introduced by d. finkelstein in 1988 @xcite .",
    "the acyclic graph means that there is not a directed loop . in this paper",
    "only such graphs are considered . then they are called graphs for simplicity .",
    "this model is the particular case of a causal set .",
    "a causal set is a pair ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , where @xmath0 is a set and @xmath1 is a binary relation on @xmath0 satisfying the following properties ( @xmath2 are general elements of @xmath0 ) : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 the first three properties are irreflexivity , acyclicity , and transitivity .",
    "these are the same as for events in minkowski spacetime .",
    "@xmath8 is called an alexandrov set of the elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 or a causal interval or an order interval . in minkowski spacetime ,",
    "an alexandrov set of any pair of events is an empty set or a set of continuum .",
    "the local finiteness means that an alexandrov set of any elements is finite .",
    "the physical meaning of this binary relation @xmath1 is causal or chronological order . by assumption",
    "a causal set describes spacetime and matter on a microscopic level . in the considered model ,",
    "the set of vertexes and the set of edges are causal sets .",
    "a causal set approach to quantum gravity has been introduced by g. t hooft @xcite and j. myrheim @xcite in 1978 .",
    "there are reviews of a causal set program @xcite .",
    "the goal of the considered model is to describe physical objects as some self - organized structures of the graph .",
    "this self - organization must be the consequence of dynamics .",
    "the model of the universe is an infinite graph . but any observer can only know finite graph . in a graph theory , by definition , an edge is a relation of two vertexes .",
    "consequently some vertexes of finite graph have less than four incident edges .",
    "these vertexes have free valences instead the absent edges .",
    "these free valences are called external edges as external lines in feynman diagrams .",
    "they are figured as edges that are incident to only one vertex .",
    "there are two types of external edges : incoming external edges and outgoing external edges .",
    "an example of the graph with 2 vertexes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) possesses 1 edge , 3 incoming external edges , and 3 outgoing external edges .",
    "we can prove that the number of incoming external edges is equal to the number of outgoing external edges for any such graph @xcite .",
    "a finite graph is a model of a part of some process .",
    "the task is to predict the future of the process or to reconstruct the past .",
    "we can reconstruct the graph step by step .",
    "the minimal part is a vertex .",
    "we start from some given graph and add new vertexes one by one .",
    "this procedure is proposed in papers of author @xcite .",
    "similar procedure and the term ` a classical sequential growth dynamics ' is proposed by d. p. rideout and r. d. sorkin @xcite for other model of causal set dynamics .",
    "we can add a new vertex to external edges .",
    "this procedure is called an elementary extension",
    ". there are four types of elementary extensions @xcite .",
    "there are two types of elementary extensions to outgoing external edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is a reconstruction of the future of the process . in this and",
    "following figures the graph @xmath11 is represented by a rectangle because it can have an arbitrary structure .",
    "the edges that take part in the elementary extension are figured by bold arrows .",
    "first type is an elementary extension to two outgoing external edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) . the number @xmath12 of incoming or outgoing external edges",

    "the numbers @xmath12 of incoming external edges and outgoing external edges have increased by 1 .        similarly , there are two types of elementary extensions to incoming external edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "these elementary extensions reconstruct the past evolution of the process .",
    "third type is an elementary extension to two incoming external edges ( fig .",

    "consider the dynamics that is based on binary alternatives .",
    "this alternative has two outcomes with probabilities @xmath13 .",
    "this process has 1 bit of information .",
    "a binary alternative is considered as some primordial entities .",
    "this idea is considered in a set of papers .",
    "for example i introduce two citations of c. f. von weizscker .",
    "it is certainly possible to decide any large alternative step by step in binary alternatives  @xcite . @xmath14",
    "the decision of an elementary binary alternative is the elementary process and hence the elementary interaction  @xcite .",

    "there is a recent paper of m. kober @xcite .    in the considered model",
    "a binary alternative is identified with an x - structure .",
    "consequently the graph is a net of binary alternatives .",
    "consider a directed path .",
    "number outgoing external edges by latin indices .",
    "number incoming external edges by greek indices .",
    "latin and greek indices range from 1 to @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the number of outgoing or incoming external edges . if we choose a directed path from any incoming external edge number @xmath15 , we must choose one of two edges in each vertex ( fig .  [",

    "this definition has clear physical meaning .",
    "the causal connection of two edges is stronger if there are more directed paths between these edges and these paths are shorter .    consider a following algorithm to calculate the probabilities of elementary extensions @xcite .",
    "there are three steps .",
    "the first step is the choice of the elementary extension to the future or to the past . by definition ,",
    "the probability of this choice is @xmath13 for both outcomes .",
    "a new vertex is added to one or two external edges .",
    "the second step is the equiprobable choice of one external edge that takes part in the elementary extension .",
    "this is an outgoing external edge if we have chosen the future evolution in the first step .",
    "otherwise this is an incoming external edge .",
    "the probability of this choice is @xmath25 for each outcome .",
    "the third step is the choice of second external edge .",
    "denote by @xmath26 the probability to choose the outgoing external edge number @xmath27 if we have chosen the outgoing external edge number @xmath19 in the second step . by definition ,",

    "each loop is formed by two directed paths .",
    "we can describe a loop as a product of these paths .",
    "the probability of the elementary extension is directly proportional to the sum of new loops that are generated by this elementary extension .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probability to add a new vertex to two incoming external edges numbers @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "the sum of all directed paths from any edge is equal to 1 .",
    "we get the right normalization if we put the following definition for the probability to add a new vertex to one outgoing or incoming external edge , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33    we can calculate the probability of any elementary extension by using this algorithm .    in this model , causality is defined as the order of vertexes and edges .",
    "but the causality has a real physical meaning only if the dynamics agrees with causality .",
    "the dynamical causality can be formulated in the following form .",
    "the probability to add a new vertex to the future can only depend on the subgraph that precedes this vertex @xcite .",
    "similarly , the probability to add a new vertex to the past can only depend on the subgraph that follows this vertex .",
    "the considered algorithm agrees with causality and has clear physical meaning .",
    "the probability to add a new vertex to two outgoing external edges is greater if their common past is larger , and this common past has the stronger connection with these edges .",
    "usually in physical theory , physical objects are considered as primary entities in instants of time .",
    "then a process is secondary , is a mapping of the objects or of their initial to their final states .",
    "an object has some state if it has some structure .",
    "but in relativity theory , structures can not exist in instants of time .",

    "the points @xmath34 and @xmath35 form a structure only together with @xmath37 .",
    "this structure has a duration @xmath39 . in the instant of time we have unconnected points .",
    "any structure has finite duration .",
    "consequently any structure is a process . according to relativity ,",
    "the world is a collection of processes ( events ) with an unexpectedly unified causal or chronological structure .",
