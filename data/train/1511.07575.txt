    "the south galactic cap @xmath0-band sky survey ( scuss ) is an international cooperative project between the national astronomical observatories of chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) and the steward observatory of the university of arizona ( x. zhou et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "the survey was originally planned to perform a sky survey of about 3700 deg@xmath1 in the south galactic cap by using the 2.3 m bok telescope .",
    "the project was initiated in fall 2009 and its first run started in 2010 september .",
    "the survey ended its observation in 2013 december .",
    "the final survey area is about 5000 deg@xmath1 , far beyond the planned area .",
    "the main goal of the survey is to supply a @xmath0-band catalog for the spectroscopic target selection of the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopy telescope @xcite .",
    "besides , combined with the @xmath3 , and @xmath4-band data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the deep scuss @xmath0-band data can be used to study the milk way and galaxies .",
    "a series of papers based on the scuss data have been published , including investigating the halo structure of the galaxy @xcite , calculating star proper motions @xcite , estimating the galactic photometric metallicity and model parameters @xcite , and selecting spectroscopic targets , such as quasars and emission line galaxies @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the data set of the scuss data release that is made publicly available .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] summarizes the survey and data reduction ; section [ sec3 ] presents the data products including the calibrated images and photometric catalogs ; section [ sec4 ] gives an analysis of the data quality .",
    "section [ sec5 ] describes the catalog of star proper motions derived by @xcite ; section [ sec6 ] is the conclusion .",
    "the scuss is a wide and deep @xmath0-band sky survey in the south galactic cap .",
    "the survey uses the 90 inch ( 2.3 m ) bok telescope that belongs to the steward observatory .",
    "it operates every night of the year except christmas eve and the maintenance period in august .",
    "the camera , named 90prime , is installed at the prime focus ( correct focal ratio @xmath5/2.98 ) .",
    "it contains four 4k@xmath64k backside - illuminated ccds that are assembled in a 2@xmath62 array with gaps along both vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "the ccds are optimized for the @xmath0-band response , giving a quantum efficiency close to 80% .",
    "the edge - to - edge fov is about 1.08@xmath61.03 .",
    "the adopted filter is similar to the sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "the scuss @xmath0 filter is somewhat bluer and narrower .",
    "the central wavelength and fwhm are 3538 and 520  , respectively @xcite .",
    "the originally designed survey footprint is located within the region of @xmath7 and galactic latitude @xmath8 .",
    "the observation started in 2010 september and ended in 2013 december .",
    "the final area is about 5000 deg@xmath1 ( dashed green line in figure [ fig1 ] ) , including the planned area , an extra area in the northwest corner , and the region extending to the anti - galactic center . in this paper",
    ", we only release the data shown in the blue area of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the area is about 4000 deg@xmath1 , 92% of which is covered by the sdss .",
    "each field has two continuous exposures , giving a total exposure time of 5 minutes .",
    "these two exposures are dithered by 1/2 of the ccd size , which benefits the internal photometric calibration and gap filling . in this way ,",
    "most of the field is covered by two exposures .",
    "some gap areas are covered by one exposure .",
    "the exposure time of 5 minutes generates an expected depth of 23.0 mag .",
    "the following is a summary of the data reduction .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "\\(1 ) detrending : a dedicate image processing pipeline was compiled , which performs some standard calibrations ( overscan subtraction , bias correction , and flat - fielding , etc . ) and special handling ( crosstalk , ccd artefacts , abnormal overscan , and sky gradient etc . )",
    "\\(2 ) astrometry : the ucac4 catalogs are used to derive the astrometric solutions . the global external position error is about 0.13 . the average internal astrometric error , from sources on overlapping exposures is about 0.09 .",
    "\\(3 ) magnitude calibrations : the sdss catalogs are used to make external photometric calibrations .",
    "we calculate the photometric zeropoints ( zps ) separately for the four amplifiers to reduce the effect of gain and photometric response variations . for images out of the sdss coverage ,",
    "we interactively derive their zps internally by using the common stars in the overlapped area .",
    "\\(4 ) image stacking : single - epoch images with specified qualities are stacked .",
    "more than 91% of stacked images are assembled by using single - epoch images with consistent qualities .",
    "\\(5 ) photometry : sextractor photometry @xcite with automatic elliptical apertures is performed on stacked images .",
    "aperture , point spread function ( psf ) and model magnitudes are measured from both stacked images and co - added flux measurements on single - epoch images .",
    "the model photometry uses the sdss @xmath9-band shape parameters . due to",
    "improper flat - fielding , scattered light , and focal plane distortion , the photometric zp would vary with the position in the ccd plane so that there are photometric residuals across the ccd .",
    "we derive such residual maps for all ccds and use them to correct the magnitudes .",
    "single - epoch images are calibrated by the dedicated image processing pipeline .",
    "there are a total of 44,937 images .",
    "the coordinate system adopts the arc celestial projection , mostly used in schmidt plate astrometry , with a 2nd - order radial distortion .",
    "the coordinate transformation between the focal plane and the celestial coordinates can be made by using our idl / python programs with the 8 coefficients in the fits header ( keywords of a81 , a82 , ... , and a88 ) and a 2nd - order coefficient , which is implemented as inline functions in the programs .",
    "the usages of these programs can be found in the webpage .",
    "the wcs parameters in the header are incorrect .",
    "the photometric zps of four amplifiers are presented in keywords of calia731 , calia732 , calia733 , and calia734 , which are corresponding to the northeast , southeast , northwest , and southwest quadrants of the image .",
    "thus , the magnitude can be calculated as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the measured flux in dn . to ensure homogeneity of the imaging depth and coverage completeness of the stacked images , we flag single - epoch images according to their qualities .",
    "the images with seeing @xmath12 3.0 , sky adu @xmath12 500 , and zp @xmath13 3.5 are flagged with  1 . \" if a sky region has not enough images flagged with  1 . \" the corresponding images in this region with seeing @xmath12 3.0 are flagged with  2 . \"",
    "if the region still has not enough images to meet the depth requirement , the rest of the images located in this region are flagged with  3 . \" .",
    "for the remaining images , we flag the ones with seeing @xmath12 3.0 with  4 \" or otherwise with  5 .",
    "\" table [ tab1 ] presents main keywords in the fits header of the single - epoch images .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the scuss survey was a collaborative program between the national astronomical observatories of china and the steward observatory .",
    "it used the 2.3 m bok telescope and wide - field 90prime camera to survey the north part of the south galactic cap in sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "the observations were completed in 2013 and covered about 5000 deg@xmath1 .",
    "this paper presents the data release of about 4000 deg@xmath1 , 92% of which is covered by the sdss .",
    "we have summarized the survey and data reduction in this paper which can be referred to @xcite and x. zhou et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) for more details .",
    "the data products include calibrated single - epoch images , stacked images , photometric catalogs .",
    "the catalogs contain the photometry of both scuss detected sources and objects in sdss catalogs and provide magnitude measurements on stacked images and co - added magnitudes from measurements on single - epoch images .",
    "the sdss information are also included in the catalogs with a 2matching error . we have analyzed the data quality , such as the sky brightness , seeing , and magnitude limit .",
    "the median limiting magnitude ( 5@xmath14 ) is about 23.2 mag , which is @xmath151.2 mag deeper than the sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "we also release a catalog of star proper motions of about 8 million objects derived by @xcite .",
    "the data and documentations can be accessed through the scuss data release website . in this website",
