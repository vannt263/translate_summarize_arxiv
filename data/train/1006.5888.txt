    "supplementary table 1 summarizes the data of the sne used in the present study .",
    "the values of the velocity gradients ( @xmath13 ) are obtained from the literature when available .",
    "they are mostly drawn from a previous compilation@xmath23 ( see supplementary tab . 1 for the sources of the observations ) , with values for additional sne obtained from the references listed in supplementary table 1 . for sn  1998aq ,",
    "we have measured @xmath13 from the published spectra@xmath42 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of the deflagration ash is derived as follows .",
    "late - time spectra of sne ia show various forbidden lines from fe - peak elements .",
    "these lines can be divided into two groups .",
    "the first group requires intense heating from radioactive @xmath8ni @xmath43 @xmath8co @xmath43 @xmath8fe decays and low material density ( e.g. , [ fe iii ]  @xmath144701 ) , while the second group requires a low heating rate and high material density ( e.g. , [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 ) .",
    "considering general properties of the emission process@xmath19 , the former lines are argued to be preferentially emitted from the detonation ash ( because it is at relatively low density with a large amount of @xmath8ni ) , while the latter lines are formed in the deflagration ash ( because it is at high density with a small amount of @xmath8ni ) .",
    "these two groups of lines show mutually different properties in observations , strengthening the interpretation that they are emitted from different regions : the ` deflagration ash'-lines show the diversity in doppler shift ( not only in [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 and [ ni  ii ]  @xmath147378@xmath44 ) , while the ` detonation ash'-lines show virtually no doppler shifts .",
    "this property led to the conclusion that the deflagration ash is on average located offset , while the detonation ash is distributed roughly spherically@xmath19 .    for @xmath20 ( the line - of - sight velocity of the deflagration ash )",
    ", we have therefore measured the wavelength shift in [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 and in [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 , and defined @xmath20 as the mean value of them ( see supplementary tab . 1 for the source of the observational data ) .",
    "the error bars are taken to be the difference in the measurements for the two lines . in all sne except for sn 2004dt , the difference in these two measurements is at most @xmath45 km s@xmath17 . for sne ia",
    "in which either of [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 or [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 is weak and unidentified , we measure @xmath20 only from the other single line , with a conservative error of @xmath45 km s@xmath17 . for sne  2007on , 2007sr , and 2009ab , we have measured @xmath13 and @xmath20 from our own spectra taken at the gemini south , the magellan , and the eso ( la silla , paranal ) telescopes . the late - time spectrum of sne  1997bp has also been obtained by us and used to measure @xmath20 .",
    "the 20 sne in supplementary table 1 are all the objects we have found for which both @xmath13 and @xmath20 are reliably available to date . also shown in the table are the light - curve decline - rate parameters @xmath46 .",
    "supplementary table 1 also lists the epoch ( after @xmath12-band maximum ) of the late - time spectra from which @xmath20 is measured . for most of the sne ia ,",
    "it is at least 200 days after @xmath12-band maximum , and thus errors caused by the blending of additional lines to this feature ( e.g. , permitted lines emitted at relatively early phases ) in measuring @xmath20 can be avoided .",
    "the features at @xmath47   , which we interpret to be dominated by [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 , do not show significant evolution at @xmath48 days after @xmath12-band maximum@xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown that normal sne  ia@xmath18 ( which constitute @xmath49% of the whole sn  ia population ) , faint 1991-bg like sne  ia@xmath50 , and bright 1991t - like sne  ia@xmath51 show different properties in @xmath13@xmath23 .",
    "normal sne  ia show a diversity in @xmath13 , which is apparently _ not _ correlated with @xmath46 .",
    "faint 1991bg - like sne  ia , which are characterized by a rapid fading ( i.e. , large @xmath46 ) , always show large @xmath13 .",
    "bright 1991t - like sne  ia with small @xmath46 always show small @xmath13 . in deriving @xmath20",
    ", we have noticed that the identification of [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 is robust for normal sne ia , but tends to be a subject of possible misidentification for the other subclasses ( then such sne ia are omitted from our analysis ) : faint 1991bg - like sne ia tend to show probable [ ca ii ]  @xmath147291 , 7324 @xmath52 .",
    "bright 1991t - like sne ia tend to show a broad single peak , possibly indicating that [ fe ii ]  @xmath147155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath147378 are broad and mutually blended .",
    "these indicate that the ejecta structure ( density , temperature , and composition ) of faint and bright sne ia is intrinsically different from normal ones .",
    "this is a reason why our sample is mainly composed of normal sne ia .",
    "luckily , omitting a large fraction of faint / bright sne ia is not important for our present analysis , since we are interested in the spectral diversity beyond the one - parameter @xmath46 description , which is a problem only in normal sne ia .    for normal sne  ia",
    ", we categorize hvg sne and lvg sne according to @xmath13 , with the division line at @xmath53 km s@xmath17 day@xmath17 . according to its @xmath13 ,",
    "sn  2004dt is an hvg .",
    "however , its peculiar observational features suggest that it is an outlier , and the origins of its high velocity gradient and the negative @xmath20 are likely different than the one for other hvgs ( see fig .  2 caption ) .",
    "one of the peculiar features of sn  2004dt appears in its late - time spectra .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "1 shows a late - time spectrum of sn  2004dt compared to the prototypical faint sn  1991bg and to the normal hvg sn  2007sr .",
    "the spectrum of sn  2004dt provides a good match to that of the faint sn  1991bg .",
    "both the intensity and the width of the lines at @xmath54    are similar for these two sne . in normal hvg sn  2007sr , the features at @xmath55     are much fainter than for sne  2004dt and 1991bg .",
    "this indicates that in the case of sn  2004dt the feature is probably contaminated by other lines , most likely [ ca  ii ]  @xmath567291 , 7324 ( note that sn 2004dt shows a larger error in @xmath20 than the other sne ia ) .",
    "in addition , the strongest lines at late phases , i.e. , the [ fe  iii ] blend at @xmath57     and the [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] blend at @xmath58     have similar ratios in sn  2004dt and 1991bg ; these ratios have been noticed to be peculiar@xmath59 .",
    "the normal hvg sn  2007sr has broader lines , and different line ratios .",
    "these similarities between the ` normal ' sn  2004dt and the faint sn  1991bg at late phases , which have not been noticed previously , suggest that these explosions might be closely related to one another .",
    "sn  2004dt may represent a new class of sne  ia@xmath60 which have sn  1991bg - like features in the late - time spectrum , but are more energetic and brighter .    supplementary table 1 : supernovae sample    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in abundance ` tomography'@xmath61 , a temporal sequence of spectra of individual sne  ia are used to infer the distribution of different elements through the sn ejecta , assuming the density structure of a spherically symmetric explosion model@xmath62 . from this type of analysis",
    ", it has been indicated that the abundance distribution is generally a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the difference between the hvg and lvg sne , not related to @xmath46 , is mainly on the extent of the si - rich layer@xmath63 and on the photospheric velocity@xmath64 , which are explained by our proposed scenario ( main text ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the spatial extent of the @xmath8ni - rich region does not seem to be dependent on whether it is a hvg or a lvg sn@xmath63 .",
    "this could provide a constraint on the ejecta asymmetry . in the offset explosion model ,",
    "the spatial extent of the @xmath8ni region , as well as the density structure at the outer edge of that region , are not sensitive to the direction , despite the initially large asymmetry in the ignition@xmath29 .",
    "this stems from the nature of the propagation of the detonation wave as described in the main text ; unlike the deflagration flame , the detonation tries to expand isotropically , producing roughly spherically distributed @xmath8ni .",
    "this region is not sensitively affected by the existence of the deflagration ashes , which is essential in determining the structure of si - rich region . as a result",
    ", the spatial extent of the @xmath8ni - rich region is mainly controlled by the different amounts of @xmath8ni produced in the explosion , and the viewing angle dependence could add some diversity at most as a secondary effect@xmath29 ; this is consistent with the observational indications@xmath63 .",
    "the asymmetric distribution of the outermost layer may imprint its signature in polarization measurements , which may be linked to the velocity gradient@xmath65 .",
    "the polarization of the si  ii line is correlated with @xmath46@xmath37 , but only for lvg sne ( supplementary fig .  2 ) .",
    "hvg sne generally show larger polarization than lvg sne@xmath66 but they clearly do not follow this trend . a global one - sided asymmetry as in the present interpretation would produce relatively low continuum polarization and relatively high line polarization at si  ii  @xmath146355@xmath67 . in our proposed scenario",
    "the global asymmetry is of smaller degree than in an extremely asymmetric model producing si  ii polarization of @xmath68%@xmath67 , thus this is likely not a major contributor to the observed polarization .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested , based on the correlation between the si  ii polarization and @xmath46 , that the observed si  ii polarization could be a measure of the thickness of the outer layer above the @xmath8ni - rich region , in which the local inhomogeneity , e.g. , a few relatively dense blobs , is assumed to be a source of polarization . in this interpretation ,",
    "the large si  ii polarization in hvg sne could be a consequence of an extended outer layer in the direction opposite to the initial sparks .",
    "it has been suggested that if the ejecta are asymmetric , @xmath46 is dependent on the direction to the observer@xmath38 .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "3 shows the comparison between @xmath46 and @xmath20 for sne  ia .    in the same figure , the possible effect of the viewing angle on the light curve shape , and the implication on the scatter in the luminosity calibration beyond the one - parameter description , are schematically illustrated .",
    "for example , the lvg sn  1998bu and the hvg sn  2002bo had similar @xmath46 values , and this could be interpreted as follows .",
    "these two sne would indeed have intrinsically different amounts of @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) and accordingly different luminosity .",
    "because of different @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) , @xmath46 would be different if viewed from the same direction .",
    "assuming that ( 1 ) @xmath46 would be smaller and the luminosity is thus larger for lvg sn  1998bu than for hvg sn  2002bo , for a putative observer at the same direction , and that ( 2 ) @xmath46 appears larger for an observer closer to the offset direction , as a viewing angle effect .",
    "then , these two sne would show similar @xmath46 as observed , despite the intrinsic difference in luminosity , since the viewing direction is closer to the offset direction for sn  1998bu .",
    "this effect would produce a scatter in the luminosity of sne  ia , around the standard luminosity determined by @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) .",
    "pairs of sne with similar @xmath46 , as a result of the viewing angle originating from sne with different amounts of @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) , are naturally expected if we observe a large number of sne  ia ( sup .",
    "3 ) for the following two reasons : ( 1 ) sne  ia do indeed show large variations in @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) , and ( 2 ) the viewing angles should display large variations .",
    "a question for this interpretation is whether any indication of such an effect is seen in the data .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "3 shows that there is no clear ( but perhaps a marginal ) correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath20 .",
    "according to the prediction@xmath38 of the viewing - angle effect on @xmath46 for models similar to the one shown in the main text , the observed @xmath46 could vary by @xmath70  mag depending on the direction to the observer ( schematically shown in sup .",
    "fig .  3 ) . this is smaller than the intrinsic variation in @xmath46 for different @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) , and thus such an effect is difficult to notice in supplementary fig .  3 , as is consistent with the low correlation in the present data .",
    "any marginal correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath20 may already hint that such an effect is indeed there , but a larger number of sne  ia is necessary to test this possibility with statistical significance .",
    "spectrum of sn  2004dt@xmath59 at 120 days after @xmath12-band maximum , compared to those of the faint sn  1991bg@xmath52 and of the normal hvg sn  2007sr at similar epochs .",
    "si  ii  @xmath146355 line polarization for sne  ia , as a function of the decline - rate parameter@xmath71 .",
    "the dashed line shows a linear fit to the data excluding sn  2004dt@xmath37 .",
    "the colors of the symbols are the same as in fig .  2 of the main text .",
    "the decline - rate parameter @xmath46 versus the late - time emission - line velocity shift .",
    "the three dashed lines schematically illustrate the expected viewing angle effect on the decline - rate parameter , which would produce a @xmath70  mag difference in the observed @xmath46 for an observer in the offset direction as opposed to the opposite direction@xmath38 .",
    "the lines correspond to three hypothesized explosion configurations which are mutually different in @xmath69(@xmath8ni ) and therefore in the intrinsic luminosity .",

    "<S> the 11 lvgs display a wider distribution in @xmath20 space , but are concentrated to negative values ( i.e. , blue - shifted ) , indicating that these events are preferentially viewed from the direction of the initial sparks . </S>",

    "<S> although this model has not been fine - tuned to reproduce the present finding , it does have the required generic features . </S>",

    "<S> 4c ) , as in our proposed picture ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> our finding provides not only strong support for the asymmetric explosion as a generic feature , but also constraints on the still - debated deflagration - to - detonation transition . in this particular simulation , </S>",
    "<S> the change in appearance ( as an hvg or an lvg sn ) takes place rather abruptly around the viewing direction of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the offset ignition , the deflagration flame propagates asymmetrically and forms an off - centre , shell - like region of high density deflagration ash . </S>",
    "<S> the detonation is ignited at an offset following the deflagration , but tries to expand almost isotropically . </S>",
    "<S> however , the angle between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is covered by the deflagration ash , into which the strong detonation wave ( fueled by the unburned material near the centre of the wd ) can not penetrate . on the other hand , in the @xmath34 direction </S>",
    "<S> , the detonation can expand freely , creating a shallow density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the ` abrupt ' change in appearance , as inferred by the observational data , is therefore a direct consequence of the offset models , controlled by the distribution of the deflagration ash . </S>",
    "<S> the ` opening angle ' of the transition is on the other hand dependent on the details of the explosion . to accurately model this according to our finding ( @xmath24 for the typical transition angle ) , </S>",
    "<S> either a smaller offset of the initial deflagration sparks or an earlier deflagration - to - detonation transition would be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> such changes are also required to produce the typical velocity shift of @xmath35 km s@xmath17 in the distribution of the deflagration ash .    our proposed model unifies into a single scheme recent advances in both theoretical and observational studies of sne  ia - and </S>",
    "<S> it does not conflict with other results produced by spectral tomography@xmath36 or polarization measurements@xmath37 ( si  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation suggests that two sne with very similar light curve evolution may not necessarily produce exactly the same amount of @xmath8ni . </S>",
    "<S> they might in fact show somewhat different light curve evolution if viewed from the same direction ( relative to the offset between the centre and the initial sparks ) , but the light curves look the same to an observer as @xmath10m@xmath11 can change with viewing direction@xmath38 ( si  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is a natural consequence of observing a number of sne ia with a large variation in @xmath8ni production and in the viewing angles . </S>",
    "<S> our finding regarding the explosion mechanism will lead to quantitative evaluation on the contribution of this random effect to the observed scatter in the sn  ia luminosities beyond the one - parameter description@xmath38 , as compared to other systematic effects , such as the stellar environment@xmath39 .    </S>",
