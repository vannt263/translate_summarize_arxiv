    "we obtain that @xmath393 .",
    "hence , there exists @xmath394 such that @xmath395 .",
    "this relation implies that @xmath396 .",
    "note that @xmath397 depend on @xmath373 and that @xmath398 , @xmath399 can only assume a finite number of values .",
    "if we show that @xmath400 can only assume a finite number of values , we will have shown that the same holds for @xmath373 , which implies that @xmath94 is finite .",
    "it is clear that the function @xmath401 :  @xmath402 defined as @xmath403 , for all @xmath404 , has period @xmath405 .",

    "since @xmath0 is compact and @xmath32 :  @xmath311 is continuous , it follows that @xmath409 is uniformly continuous .",
    "define the function @xmath319 :  @xmath40 by @xmath410 , for @xmath411 .",
    "recall that , by construction , we have that @xmath90 , for all @xmath91 .",
    "note that @xmath412 and @xmath331 are smooth , for each @xmath18 . since @xmath331 is a non - negative function ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath319 is a smooth non - decreasing function .",
    "therefore , @xmath413 , for all @xmath414 . the uniform continuity of @xmath409 then implies that there exists @xmath161 such that @xmath415 ( indeed , choose @xmath416 ) .",
    "the convergence result of lemma  [ edcl - p ] means that @xmath417 let @xmath418 and define @xmath419 .",
