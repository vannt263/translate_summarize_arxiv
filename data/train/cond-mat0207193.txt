    "the superconductivity in sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11@xcite has been revealed to be unconventional by many experiments ; it is spin - triplet@xcite , it breaks time - reversal symmetry@xcite , and its energy gap has line nodes@xcite .",
    "the triplet superconductivity with horizontal line nodes of the energy gap has been proposed@xcite to explain these experiments .",
    "the absence of the angle dependence of the thermal conductivity within the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane @xcite shows that the line nodes run horizontally on the fermi surface .",
    "the angle resolved ultrasound attenuation experiment@xcite is compatible with the horizontal line nodes .",
    "the fermi surface of sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 consists of three cylindrical surfaces named @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16@xcite , as predicted by the band calculation@xcite .",
    "the hybridization of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbits of ruthenium with the @xmath19 orbit of oxygen makes two one - dimensional bands , if the mixing of these bands is neglected .",
    "if small mixing is taken into account , we get hole - like @xmath14 and electron - like @xmath15 , but the nesting of the fermi surfaces survives as predicted@xcite and confirmed by the inelastic neutron scattering experiment@xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 surface is constructed by the @xmath20 orbit of ruthenium and is two - dimensional .",
    "nomura and yamada@xcite have studied the two - dimensional three - band hubbard model in the third - order perturbation theory and obtained that triplet superconductivity is stabilized mainly in the two - dimensional band .",
    "they also obtained the line - node - like power - law behavior in the temperature - dependence of the specific heat due to the vertical node - like energy gap in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands . in their treatment the momentum dependence of the gap is determined at the transition temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the spin - triplet state such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 vector , should be mixed with @xmath26 or @xmath27 at @xmath28 and the vertical line nodes will disappear@xcite .",
    "zhitomirsky and rice@xcite proposed the mechanism for the horizontal line nodes that while the active band has a full energy gap , the interband proximity effect makes the horizontal line nodes in the passive band .",
    "they assumed that the two - dimensional band is active and that the line nodes are in one - dimensional bands .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that spin - triplet superconductivity is induced in the quasi - one dimensional bands by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation if the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation is anisotropic in the spin space@xcite .",
    "if this is the case the one - dimensional bands are expected to have a full energy gap and the two - dimensional band has line nodes .    therefore , the determination of the gap structure is important to understand the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 .",

    "dynamical susceptibility for the spin - triplet superconductivity has been studied theoretically@xcite .",
    "recently , the resonance peak in @xmath33 is shown to be a sign of the triplet superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the order parameter assumed in these papers , however , does not seem to be consistent with experiments in sr@xmath10ruo@xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we show the general form of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath34 in the unitary states of the triplet superconductivity and calculate it in the system which has the nested fermi surface with and without line nodes in the nested part of the fermi surface .",
