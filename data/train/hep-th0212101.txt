    "as was proposed in @xcite , one can reproduce four - dimensional gravity on a 3-brane in 6 or higher dimensional infinite - volume bulk if one includes the einstein - hilbert term on the brane ( the latter is induced at the quantum level if the brane matter is non - conformal ) .",
    "gravity then is almost completely localized on the brane with only ultra - light modes penetrating into the bulk , so that gravity is four - dimensional at distance scales up to an ultra - large cross - over scale @xmath0 ( beyond which gravity becomes higher dimensional ) , which can be larger than the present hubble size . in particular , this is the case for codimension-2 and higher tensionless branes @xcite as well as for codimension-2 non - zero tension branes @xcite .",
    "this is also expected to be the case for codimension-3 and higher non - zero tension branes @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of linearized gravity in such backgrounds requires smoothing out higher codimension singularities @xcite .",
    "this is already the case for tensionless branes , where the background is non - singular ( in fact , it is flat ) , but the graviton propagator is singular .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite , these singularities in the graviton propagator are cured once we include higher curvature terms on the _",
    "brane_. these terms are induced at the quantum level along with the einstein - hilbert term , and provide an ultra - violet cut - off for the graviton propagator . in the presence of these terms , to reproduce four - dimensional gravity up to the present hubble size , we need to assume that the bulk planck scale @xmath1 regardless of the codimension of the brane ( assuming that it is 2 or higher ) @xcite .    in the case of non - zero tension branes",
    ", however , the situation is more complicated as in the case of @xmath2-function - like branes the background itself becomes singular ( for phenomenologically interesting non - bps branes on which we focus in this paper ) .",
    "more precisely , here we focus on solutions with vanishing cosmological constant on the brane . then in the codimension-2 case",
    "the singularity is very mild as in the extra 2 dimensions the background has the form of a wedge with a deficit angle , so the singularity is a simple conical one @xcite .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite , this singularity can be consistently smoothed out . in this case gravity on the brane",
    "was analyzed in @xcite , where it was found that the behavior of gravity is essentially unmodified compared with the tensionless brane cases .",
    "in particular , gravity is almost completely localized with only ultra - light modes penetrating into the bulk , and four - dimensional gravity on the brane can be reproduced up to distance scales of order of the current hubble size . as to the brane tension , in codimension-2 solutions with vanishing brane cosmological constant it can take continuous values in the range bounded below by zero and bounded above by its critical value @xcite , which is of order @xmath3 ( for a 3-brane ) .",
    "since this does not improve the current experimental bound on the 4-dimensional cosmological constant , we are prompted to consider codimension-3 and higher solutions .    in codimension-3 and higher cases with non - zero tension",
    "branes the singularities in the background itself are more severe . actually , there are two types of singularities we must distinguish here .",
    "thus , we can have a singularity at the origin @xmath4 of the extra space , that is , at the location of the brane .",
    "these singularities can sometimes be simple coordinate singularities , in which case they are harmless .",
    "on the other hand , true @xmath4 singularities can be smoothed out using a procedure discussed in @xcite .",
    "this procedure goes as follows .",
    "consider a codimension-@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xmath2-function - like source brane in @xmath7-dimensional bulk .",
    "let the bulk action simply be the @xmath7-dimensional einstein - hilbert action , while on the brane we have the induced @xmath8-dimensional einstein - hilbert term as well as the cosmological term corresponding to the brane tension .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the background in this case is singular @xcite .",
    "one way to smooth out such a singularity is to replace the @xmath8-dimensional world - volume of the brane by its product with a @xmath5-dimensional ball @xmath9 of some non - zero radius @xmath10 .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , in this case already for a tensionless brane the gravitational modes on the brane contain an infinite tower of tachyonic modes .",
    "this can be circumvented by considering a partial smoothing out where one replaces the @xmath8-dimensional world - volume of the brane by its product with a @xmath11-sphere @xmath12 of radius @xmath10 @xcite . as was pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "this suffices for smoothing out higher codimension singularities in the graviton propagator as in the codimension-1 case the propagator is non - singular @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of tensionless branes as well as in the case of a non - zero tension codimension-2 brane we then have only one tachyonic mode ( with ultra - low @xmath13 ) which is expected to be an artifact of not including non - local operators on the brane . as to the background itself ,",
    "this procedure does smooth out @xmath4 singularities .",
    "however , not surprisingly , it does not suffice for smoothing out the second type of singularities @xcite ( such singularities are absent in the codimension-2 case but are present in higher codimension cases with non - zero brane tension ) , which we discuss next .",
    "thus , in codimension-3 and higher cases with vanishing brane cosmological constant we can have singularities at @xmath14 with some non - vanishing @xmath15 , which depends on the brane tension @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned smoothing out procedure does not cure such singularities .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that higher curvature terms in the _ bulk _ might be responsible for curing such singularities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is precisely to study effects of higher curvature terms in the bulk on such singularities .",
    "not surprisingly , studying such backgrounds in the presence of higher curvature terms in the bulk is rather non - trivial . to make the problem more tractable , we focus on a special kind of higher curvature terms in the bulk . in particular , we consider adding the second - order ( in curvature ) gauss - bonnet combination in the bulk .",
    "this gauss - bonnet combination is an euler invariant in four dimensions . in higher dimensions , however , it has a non - trivial effect on the equations of motion if the background is not flat .",
    "a simplifying feature of the gauss - bonnet combination is that it does not introduce terms with third and fourth derivatives in the background equations of motions , but rather makes them even more non - linear .",
    "albeit non - trivial , these equations can in certain cases be analyzed analytically , so we can get some insight into the effect of higher curvature terms on the aforementioned @xmath14 singularities .",
    "the results of our analyses , which we present in the remainder of this paper , suggest that higher curvature terms in the bulk might indeed cure these singularities . to simplify our discussion , as far as explicit computations are concerned ,",
    "we focus on codimension-3 cases , where we have additional simplifications in the equations of motion ( higher codimension cases are _ not _ expected to be qualitatively different ) . in particular , we explicitly study examples of : a string in 5d bulk , a membrane in 6d bulk as well as a 3-brane in 7d bulk . in these cases",
    "we argue that smooth solutions with vanishing brane cosmological constant do exist for a continuous range of positive brane tension . in the remainder of this paper , following the terminology adopted in @xcite",
    ", we refer to such solutions as _ diluting _ solutions .",
    "before we turn to a detailed description of our solutions , let us describe the geometry of the aforementioned diluting solution corresponding to a 3-brane in 7d bulk . in the extra three dimensions we have a radially symmetric solution where a 2-sphere is fibered over a semi - infinite line @xmath16 .",
    "the space is curved for @xmath17 , at @xmath18 we have a jump in the radial derivatives of the warp factors ( because @xmath18 is where the brane tension is localized ) , and for @xmath19 the space is actually _",
    "flat_. so an outside observer located at @xmath19 thinks that the brane is tensionless , while an observer inside of the sphere , that is , at @xmath20 sees the space highly curved .",
    "it would take this observer infinite time to reach the point @xmath21 , where we have a coordinate singularity ( that is , the corresponding geodesics are complete , so this is _ not _ a naked singularity but a coordinate one ) .",
    "this is an important point , in particular , we did not find smooth solutions where the space would be curved outside but flat inside of the sphere . and this is just as well . indeed ,",
    "as was shown in @xcite , if we have only the einstein - hilbert term in the bulk , then we have no smooth solutions whatsoever ( that is , smoothing out the 3-brane by making it into a 5-brane with two dimensions curled up into a 2-sphere does not suffice ) .",
    "what is different in our solutions is that we have added higher curvature terms in the bulk , which we expected to smooth out some singularities . but",
    "serving as an ultra - violet cut - off higher curvature terms could only possibly smooth out a real singularity at @xmath20 , not at @xmath19 . and",
    "this is precisely what happens in our solution - the presence of higher curvature terms ensures that we have only a coordinate singularity at @xmath20 instead of a real naked singularity as would be the case had we included only the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "the brane world model we study in this paper is described by the following action : @xmath22   + \\nonumber\\\\   & & { m}^{d-2}_p \\int d^{d}x~   \\sqrt{-{g}}~\\left[{r}~+\\xi\\biggl(r^2 - 4r_{mn}^2+r_{mnpr}^2\\biggl)\\right ] .",

    "at first it might seem that it can be arbitrary as we can adjust the integration constant @xmath86 .",
    "however , we also have a relation between the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath63 and @xmath86 : @xmath87 which implies that @xmath88 that is , these solutions are _ not _ `` diluting '' , rather they exist only if we fine - tune the brane tension and the gauss - bonnet coupling ( we discuss the reason for this in the next subsection ) . in the following",
    "we will see that this specific to the case at hand , and diluting solutions do exist in other cases .",
    "before we end this subsection , let us analyze the singularity structure in the above solutions .",
    "singularities can potentially occur at @xmath89 in solution a and at @xmath90 in solution b. thus , the line element in the non - trivially warped part of the space - time is given by : @xmath91 which is singular at @xmath4 for both roots @xmath92 .",
    "however , only for @xmath93 is the space truly singular , whereas for @xmath94 we merely have a coordinate singularity .",
    "thus , consider a @xmath95-derivative scalar .",
    "such an object - let us call it @xmath96 - has the following expression in terms of the extra - space radius @xmath97 the latter blows up for @xmath93 as @xmath53 approaches zero ; this singularity is a naked singularity .",
    "one can indeed consider radial null geodesics with affine parameter @xmath98 and use that @xmath99 is constant along geodesics to obtain @xmath100 for @xmath93 these geodesics terminate with finite affine parameter as @xmath53 approaches zero , @xmath101 thus , we have incomplete geodesics reaching a point of divergent curvature . on the other hand , for @xmath94 the expression ( [ n - scalar ] ) vanishes as @xmath53 approaches zero , the aforementioned geodesics are complete ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath102 ) , and it is not difficult to see , by doing a similar calculation , that radial time - like geodesics extend to infinite proper time in this limit .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 is a coordinate singularity in this case .",
    "this then implies that for solution b we must choose @xmath94 .",
    "it then follows that the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath63 is _ positive _ in this case .",
    "similar considerations apply to the @xmath103 singularity . in this case",
    "we have a naked singularity for @xmath94 , while for @xmath93 we merely have a coordinate singularity .",
    "this implies that for solution a we must choose @xmath93 .",
    "note that in this case the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath63 is also _",
    "positive_.    another comment we would like to make here concerns the volume of the extra space , which is infinite .",
    "indeed , this volume is given by @xmath104 in solution b this volume is clearly infinite .",
    "in fact , in solution b even the volume of the space inside of the @xmath11-sphere ( that is , for @xmath105 ) is infinite : @xmath106 on the other hand , in solution a the volume of the space inside of the @xmath11-sphere is finite ; but the volume outside of the @xmath11-sphere ( that is , for @xmath107 ) is infinite : @xmath108 that is , in both solution a and solution b the extra space has infinite volume .",
    "however , as we saw above , in this case we would have a naked singularity at @xmath109 , and the finiteness of the volume of the extra space would be due to truncating the space , which is geodesically incomplete , at the naked singularity .",
    "a similar situation will arise again in the following sections . ] .",
    "thus , as we see , we have sensible infinite - volume _ non - singular _ solutions if we take the bulk action to be given by the gauss - bonnet combination .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned , these solutions exist only for the fine - tuned value of the brane tension .",
    "if the brane tension is not fine - tuned , then we expect to have solutions where the non - compact part of the brane is inflating .",
    "let us now consider the case of a membrane ( @xmath66 ) in 6d bulk ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "as in the string case discussed in the previous subsection a drastic simplification of the equations of motion occurs if we neglect the einstein - hilbert term in the bulk action . in this subsection",
    "we will focus on this case .",
    "the ( @xmath110 ) , ( @xmath111 ) and ( @xmath112 ) equations of motion read : @xmath113 here @xmath114 if we use @xmath115 instead of @xmath53 , then the metric takes the following form : @xmath116 where , as before , @xmath44 is the metric on a unit @xmath11-sphere , while @xmath117 .",
    "for our purposes here it will be convenient to use @xmath118 .",

    ", we can check that null and time - like radial geodesics are complete in these limits .",
    "the affine parameter for null geodesics diverges as @xmath130 while the proper time diverges as @xmath131 .",
    "what about finite distance singularities ?",
    "first , note that for the function @xmath132 in ( [ solution : m - brane ] ) we have @xmath133 since @xmath134 , the l.h.s . of this equation",
    "is strictly positive for @xmath135 between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "this together with ( [ limits ] ) implies that @xmath132 is a monotonically increasing function bounded from below by its value @xmath136 at @xmath4 and bounded from above by its asymptotic value @xmath137 at @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , @xmath132 is finite .",
    "however , @xmath132 does go through zero at a finite value of @xmath53 . according to ( [ mem1-fin ] ) and ( [ mem2-fin ] ) this could potentially lead to to a nasty finite - distance singularity in the full solution , the curvature scalar diverges as @xmath138 , and radial null geodesics are incomplete . ]",
    "however , as we will now see , this does _ not _ actually take place for a range of values of the brane tension .",
    "thus , we need to accommodate the jump conditions @xmath139 which follow from ( [ mem2 ] ) and ( [ mem3 ] ) . to do this ,",
    "we can consider two types of solutions : + @xmath72 solution a : @xmath140 @xmath72 solution b : @xmath141 we must check that we can consistently glue these solutions with the non - trivial solution with @xmath132 given by ( [ solution : m - brane ] ) for @xmath19 for solution a and for @xmath20 for solution b.    let us start with solution b. the jump condition ( [ jump1 ] ) then reads : @xmath142 now consider solutions with @xmath143 ( but @xmath144 ) . from our previous discussion",
    "it follows that such a solution is non - singular . assuming that @xmath145 , this requires that @xmath63 be _ positive _ - indeed , the l.h.s . of ( [ m - jump-1 ] )",

    "we can then choose @xmath146 such that ( [ m - jump-1 ] ) is satisfied ( note that @xmath135 does not depend on @xmath146 since it is only related to @xmath147 ) .",

    "consider the case where @xmath151 .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that we have @xmath152 this implies that @xmath153 note the difference between this result and the corresponding result ( [ cc - string ] ) for the string discussed in the previous subsection . in the latter case",
    "the brane tension had to be fine - tuned . in the case of the membrane",
    "we actually have _ diluting _ - the solution exists for a range of the brane tension @xmath150 .",
    "indeed , @xmath154 depends on the integration constant @xmath122 , which is the source of this diluting property .",
    "thus , in the case where @xmath151 we have @xmath155 so that the brane tension @xmath156 depends on @xmath122 . note that in the case of the string the function @xmath132 defined as above is actually a _ numerical constant _ away from the brane .",
    "this is precisely why we did not find a diluting solution in the case of the string .",
    "on the other hand , for a membrane as well as higher dimensional branes this function is non - trivial and depends on an additional integration constant , hence the diluting property of such solutions . in turn , the reason why this is possible , say , in the membrane case is that equations of motion are more non - linear than those in the string case .",
    "let us now consider solution a. in this case the jump conditions read : @xmath157 if we take @xmath158 ( but @xmath159 ) , then we have a smooth solution .",
    "in fact , this solution is also _ diluting_. this can be seen by noting that choosing _ positive _ @xmath63 and @xmath149 ensures that the jump conditions can be satisfied .    the last comment we would like to make here concerns the volume of the extra space",
    "it is evident that this volume is infinite in solution b. for solution a we have the following expression for this volume : @xmath160 asymptotically at @xmath109 we have @xmath161 it is then not difficult to see that the volume of the extra space in solution a is infinite as well .",
    "numerical results ( obtained using maple 6 ) for @xmath162 and @xmath163 for solution a are presented in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively .",

    "we therefore would have a coordinate singularity at @xmath109 as @xmath227 and @xmath228 and @xmath223 diverge , but at @xmath90 we would have a true singularity as we have diverging curvature and incomplete geodesics .",

    "recall that in this solution @xmath63 must be _ positive _ ( as the solution with negative @xmath63 has a true singularity at @xmath4 ) .",
    "in the @xmath176 case the solution with @xmath229 has a true singularity at @xmath109 .",
    "this explains why in this solution we found that the volume of the extra space is finite .",
    "this appears to be an artifact of cutting off the extra space at the singularity . at any rate , since this solution is truly singular , we will no longer focus on it .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath176 solution with @xmath230 only has a coordinate singularity at @xmath4 , so this solution is perfectly acceptable . in this solution , which is _ diluting _ with _ positive _ brane tension , the volume of the extra space is infinite .",
    "numerical results for this solution are given in fig.3 and fig.4 .    finally , let us show that at @xmath231 in the the @xmath176 solutions where @xmath232 and @xmath233 we would indeed have true singularities ( that is , if we do not replace them by constant @xmath51 and @xmath52 solutions ) . in the former case as @xmath234 we have @xmath235 where @xmath236",
    "it then follows that @xmath237 so that as @xmath234 the curvature scalar diverges as @xmath238 and radial null geodesics terminate with finite affine parameter at @xmath21 .",

    "in fact , here we would like to give a general discussion of certain points relevant to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "thus , we have been referring to @xmath150 ( or , more precisely , @xmath244 ) as the brane tension .",
    "this quantity is indeed the tension of the brane @xmath27 whose world - volume has the geometry of @xmath245 .",
    "note , however , that a bulk observer at @xmath19 does not see this brane tension - to such an observer the brane appears to be tensionless .",

    "the non - vanishing ( in fact , positive ) tension of the brane @xmath27 does not curve the space outside of the sphere @xmath30 . instead , it curves the space _ inside _ the sphere @xmath30 , that is , at @xmath20 . and this happens without producing any singularity at @xmath20 , and with the non - compact part of the world - volume of the brane remaining flat .",
    "here it is important to note that the effective tension of the _ fat _ @xmath246-brane whose world - volume is @xmath247 ( this @xmath246-brane is fat as it is extended in the extra @xmath11 angular dimensions ) is also positive .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this brane tension is given by @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the volume of the sphere @xmath30 , @xmath250 is the volume of the _ unit _ @xmath11-sphere , and we have taken into account that the radius of the sphere @xmath30 is not @xmath10 but rather @xmath251 we therefore have : @xmath252 thus , for @xmath253 ( which is part of the parameter space for the aforementioned solution ) this effective fat brane tension is _",
    "positive_.    next , the @xmath64-dimensional planck scale @xmath254 is given by @xmath255 in particular , if we consider a 3-brane in 7d bulk , we have : @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the 3-brane tension , @xmath258 is the 4-dimensional planck scale , @xmath25 is the 6-dimensional planck scale , and @xmath259 is the radius of the extra 2-sphere ( recall that we actually have a 5-brane with two dimensions curled up into a 2-sphere of radius @xmath259 , while the radial direction transverse to this 5-brane is non - compact and has infinite - volume ) .    _ a priori _ we can reproduce the 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath260 by choosing @xmath259 between @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "the 6-dimensional planck scale then ranges between @xmath263 and @xmath264 . on the other hand , it is reasonable to assume that the analyses of @xcite should give the same `` see - saw '' modification of gravity in the present case , in particular , once we take into account higher curvature terms on the _ brane _ , to obtain 4-dimensional gravity up to the distance scales of order of the present hubble size , we must assume that the `` fundamental '' 7-dimensional planck scale ] @xmath265 let us see what range of values we can expect for the 5-brane tension @xmath266 .",
    "thus , the 5-brane tension @xmath267 if we assume that the standard model fields come from a 6-dimensional 5-brane theory compactified on the 2-sphere need not in general result in supersymmetry breaking at a scale of order @xmath268 .",
    "thus , one could imagine embedding our scenario in a higher dimensional theory ( with perhaps some extra dimensions compactified ) where the 2-sphere is fibered over a 4-dimensional base ( such that the resulting space is supersymmetric;. in such 11-dimensional setup we might need , say , an additional @xmath269 orbifold to obtain a chiral 4-dimensional theory ) .",
    "alternatively , the 5-brane could be a brane wrapped on a @xmath270 corresponding to an orbifold blow - up .",
    "] , then we might need to require that @xmath271 .",
    "then @xmath25 ranges between @xmath272 and @xmath258 , while the 5-brane tension ranges between @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "note that _ a priori _ this is not in conflict with having the supersymmetry breaking scale in the tev range .    in principle , the above scenario _ a priori _ does not seem to be inconsistent modulo the fact that we still need to explain why the 6-dimensional plank scale @xmath25 is many orders of magnitude ( 30 in the extreme case where @xmath275 ) higher than the seven - dimensional planck scale @xmath23 ( see the last section for some speculations on this point ) .",
    "note , however , that the same issue is present in any theory with infinite - volume extra dimensions .",
    "the diluting property of our non - singular solution could be suggestive as far as addressing the cosmological constant problem is concerned . in particular , we do have a solution where the non - compact 4-dimensional part of the brane is flat , yet its tension can take positive values in a continuous range . in particular , no fine tuning appears to be required in our solution .",
    "before we end this section , let us see what kind of values of @xmath154 we would need to have in order to obtain a solution satisfying the above phenomenological considerations .",
    "first , we will assume that the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath276 ( its `` natural '' value - see footnote  [ f6 ] ) .",

    "we can for instance take the @xmath452 ( @xmath453 ) case in which ( [ mc1 ] ) and ( [ mc2 ] ) become , respectively , @xmath454 which gives @xmath278 , and @xmath455 , and @xmath10 is very close to the would - be singularity @xmath15 ( here for definiteness we have assumed the extreme case @xmath456 ) : @xmath457 note that the singularity at @xmath458 would be there if we took the interior solution for @xmath20 and continued it for values @xmath19 . however , in our solution ( just as in the case without the einstein - hilbert term ) there is no singularity as for @xmath19 the warp factors are actually constant , and this is consistent with the matching conditions at @xmath18 . in particular , the solutions are smooth everywhere , just as their counterparts from the previous section .",
    "thus , as we see , in the presence of both the einstein - hilbert and gauss - bonnet terms in the bulk action we have sensible smooth solutions with positive brane tension .",
    "moreover , these solutions are _ diluting _ , that is , they exist for a range of values of the brane tension ( note that the gauss - bonnet coupling in these solutions is _ positive _ ) .",
    "before we end this subsection , let us emphasize some important points . in the diluting solutions we just discussed",
    ", we have a coordinate ( but not a real ) singularity at some finite @xmath459 .",
    "as we mentioned above , this coordinate singularity is harmless as the corresponding geodesics are complete .",
    "note that in the case without the einstein - hilbert term the corresponding coordinate singularity is at @xmath4 .",
    "the reason why is the following . if we start with a solution corresponding to both the einstein - hilbert and gauss - bonnet terms present in the bulk , to arrive at the solution corresponding to only the gauss - bonnet term present in the bulk we must take the limit @xmath460 , @xmath461 .",
    "it is then not difficult to check that in this limit the coordinate singularity at @xmath21 continuously moves to @xmath4 .",
    "also note that , since the singularity at @xmath21 in the full solution is a coordinate singularity , we can consistently cut the space at @xmath21 .",
    "the geometry of the resulting solution then is as follows . in the extra three dimensions we have a radially symmetric solution where a 2-sphere is fibered over a semi - infinite line @xmath16 .",
    "the space is curved for @xmath17 , at @xmath18 we have a jump in the radial derivatives of the warp factors ( because @xmath18 is where the brane tension is localized ) , and for @xmath19 the space is actually _",
    "flat_. so an outside observer located at @xmath19 thinks that the brane is tensionless , while an observer inside of the sphere , that is , at @xmath20 sees the space highly curved ( and it would take this observer infinite time to reach the coordinate singularity at @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is an important point , in particular , note that we did not find smooth exterior solutions where the space would be curved outside but flat inside . and",
    "this is just as well . indeed ,",
    "as was shown in @xcite , if we have only the einstein - hilbert term in the bulk , then we have no smooth solutions whatsoever ( that is , smoothing out the 3-brane by making it into a 5-brane with two dimensions curled up into a 2-sphere does not suffice ) .",
    "what is different in our solutions is that we have added higher curvature terms in the bulk , which we expected to smooth out some singularities . but serving as an ultra - violet cut - off higher curvature terms could only possibly smooth out a real singularity at @xmath20 , not at @xmath19 . and",
    "this is precisely what happens in our solution - the presence of higher curvature terms ensures that we have only a coordinate singularity at @xmath20 instead of a real naked singularity as would be the case had we included only the einstein - hilbert term .      in this section",
    "we saw that in the presence of the einstein - hilbert and gauss - bonnet terms in the bulk action we have smooth infinite - volume solutions which exist for a range of positive values of the brane tension ( the diluting property ) .",
    "these solutions , therefore , provide examples of brane world scenarios where the brane world - volume can be flat without any fine - tuning or presence of singularities .",
    "is this then a solution to the cosmological constant problem ?    to answer this question , we need to address some issues here .",
    "first , note that we have chosen a particular combination of quadratic in curvature terms in the bulk action , namely , the gauss - bonnet combination .",
    "one could argue that this is a fine - tuning as we have to fix two independent parameters at the quadratic level to obtain the gauss - bonnet combination ( note that one out of three _ a priori _ independent parameters corresponds to the gauss - bonnet coupling , which is arbitrary in our solutions ) .",
    "however , we suspect ( albeit we do not have a proof of this statement ) that even for generic higher curvature terms solutions with the aforementioned properties should still exist .",
    "in particular , we suspect that the fact that we found non - singular solutions has to do with including _ higher curvature _ terms in the bulk rather than with their particular ( gauss - bonnet ) combination , which we have chosen to make computations tractable .",
    "a more serious issue here has a phenomenological origin .",
    "thus , as we discussed in subsection d of section iii , the 6-dimensional planck scale on the 5-brane ( whose world - volume is a product of the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time and a 2-sphere of a radius @xmath259 ) @xmath462 - as was explained in @xcite , we must have the 7-dimensional bulk planck scale @xmath463 , so that the four - dimensional laws of gravity persist up the the distance scales of order of the observable hubble size .",
    "naturally , here we can ask the following question : why is the 6-dimensional planck scale on the 5-brane many ( up to 30 in the extreme case where @xmath264 ) orders of magnitude larger than the 7-dimensional planck scale ? we would like to give one speculative scenario for obtaining such a hierarchy of planck scales .",
    "thus , let the 5-brane theory be a ( non - conformal ) large @xmath464 gauge theory .",
    "then the planck scale induced on the brane due to quantum effects is expected to be of order of @xmath465 .",
    "the required rank of the gauge theory in this case would have to be up to @xmath466 ( in the extreme case ) .",
    "it would be interesting to understand if one could accommodate the standard model in such a scenario .",
    "there are many interesting open questions to be addressed in scenarios with infinite - volume extra dimensions .",
    "as was originally pointed out in @xcite , these scenarios offer a new arena for addressing the cosmological constant problem .",
    "we hope our results we presented in this paper are at least encouraging in this context . and",
    "addressing the aforementioned open questions definitely seems to be worthwhile . in this light",
