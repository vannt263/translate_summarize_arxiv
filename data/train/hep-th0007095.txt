    "since 1984 @xcite , two  dimensional conformal field theory has remained a fascinating subject , at the frontier of mathematics and physics . in two  dimensional physics , conformal theories proved to be a powerful tool in the study of critical and off ",
    "critical models , and in the dynamics of string theory through the description of the world  sheet .",
    "more recently , they have prompted an overwhelming activity in mathematics , in as different subject as the theory of singularities , knot theory , combinatorics , algebraic geometry , von neumann algebras , ...    strangely , many of the developments have been triggered by the problem of modular invariance , most notably by the remarkable and not yet fully understood ade classification of @xmath2 affine theories .",
    "affine theories are conformal field theories with an affine lie algebra as symmetry algebra , prime examples being the wess ",
    "witten models ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "despite much progress and many partial results , only the simpler cases have been fully classified : those based on the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the modular invariants are torus partition functions with periodic boundary conditions in both directions",
    ". a better understanding of these models can be gained by allowing other types of monodromies , a systematic source of which being twists effected by the elements of an internal symmetry group . as shown by zuber @xcite ,",
    "this can be done from the knowledge of the critical modular invariants , by examining the modular covariance of the sought twisted partition functions .",
    "illustrations of the method were given in the @xmath4 series of virasoro minimal models , but the analysis was subsequently completed and extended to all minimals models @xcite , with the somewhat expected results that the symmetry group discrete of a model @xmath5 is simply the automorphism group of the dynkin diagram of @xmath6 .",
    "this result feeds the general feeling that the graphs that have been associated with modular invariants are key elements in the description of the corresponding conformal theory , a bit like a dynkin diagram commands a lie algebra .",
    "it is our purpose to pursue this analysis for affine models , based on the affine algebras @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for those , we determine the maximal discrete symmetry group and compute the partition functions in all twisted sectors .",
    "there are several motivations for doing this .",
    "first of all , no affine model yet has been realized as the scaling limit of a critical lattice model , unlike the unitary minimal virasoro models .",
    "thus the knowledge of the symmetries can be a useful guide in the search of such models .",
    "in addition , the modular invariant partition function contains information on the periodic sector only , and so can not distinguish between theories with the same partition function but otherwise distinct .",
    "symmetry arguments can do this , or can at least suggest this possibility , as in the @xmath1 models at level @xmath7 and 6 , see below .",
    "moreover , the presence of a symmetry implies selection rules in the operator product algebra , both in the bulk and on boundaries , resulting in non ",
    "trivial constraints on operator product coefficients @xcite . and last , the relevance of the graphs may be further probed , by comparing the symmetries found in the affine theory and those of the associated graph(s ) . from this point of view , we will see that , even though the results are qualitatively different for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 models , the graphs are definitely relevant also for symmetries .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first recall the general setting for discrete symmetries and twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we explain the strategy we use in order to determine the maximal symmetry compatible with a given modular invariant , and also the catches of such an analysis .",
    "after a few words about orbifolds , we recall the salient features of the association of graphs with modular invariants .    in the following section , we summarize our results , in the form of lists of groups and of partition functions , for all @xmath2 and @xmath3 modular invariant theories .",
    "we then undertake a general comparison of these results with the graph data .",
    "a study of particular cases , which we found the most intructive or representative all taken from @xmath3 models , finishes the third section .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the proofs .",
    "many of the above results can be proved using the techniques of @xcite .",
    "so we will content ourselves with giving the explicit proof in two representative series of modular invariants ( the type ii @xmath8series of automorphism invariants of @xmath2 , and the type i @xmath8series of @xmath3 ) .",
    "a general summary concluding this work is presented in section 5 .",
    "a particularly interesting geometry to study two  dimensional conformal field theory is the toroidal geometry .",
    "it is well  known that two different tori are conformally equivalent if they are related by a modular transformation .",
    "explicitely , if we denote by @xmath9 ( i m @xmath10 ) the standard modulus of the torus , the action of the modular group is given by \\ { : a , b , c , d ad - bc=1 } this group , isomorphic to psl@xmath11 , is generated by the two transformations @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a conformally invariant theory on the torus ( i.e. , with doubly periodic boundary conditions ) is thus described by a modular invariant partition function ( mipf ) . here , we consider theories based on untwisted affine lie algebras @xcite , which implies that the mipfs are sesquilinear forms in the characters , z ( ) = _ p , p [ _ p()]^ * m_p , p [ _ p ( ) ] , [ mipf ] for non  negative integral coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "the sum over the character labels @xmath15 is finite .",
    "the classification of all modular invariant partition functions has been completed for the algebras @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the classification for the other algebras is so far incomplete , which is the reason why we focus in this article on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "while mipfs are associated with periodic boundary conditions , there may be other choices of boundary conditions , corresponding to different monodromy properties of the fields along non  contractible loops .",
    "in particular , twisted , non  periodic boundary conditions are possible in a theory which has a symmetry group .",
    "the group , @xmath18 say , acts on the various fields @xmath19 and leaves the ( periodic , bulk ) hamiltonian invariant .",
    "the twisted boundary conditions induced by the action of @xmath18 can be written , in the case of the torus , as ( z+1)=^g(z ) , ( z+)=^g(z ) , .",
    "a pair @xmath20 defines a specific sector of the theory corresponding to the given twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the consistency of the boundary conditions with the translation group of the torus requires that @xmath21 and @xmath22 commute .",
    "each sector of boundary conditions has its own partition function @xmath23 ( called frustrated or twisted in the case of non  periodic b.c . ) , given , in the hamiltonian formalism , by @xcite z_g , g ( ) = tr__g ( q^l_0-c/24 q^l_0-c/24g ) , q = e^2i .",
    "this formula gives a different status to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath24 is the hilbert space of states that live on the fixed time slices ( chosen to be lines of constant im@xmath25 in the complex plane ) , and is subjected to the @xmath21 boundary condition , while the boundary condition in the time direction is effected by the insertion of @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath21 specifies the @xmath21sector @xmath24 of states / fields of the theory , which carries an action of the centralizer @xmath26 of @xmath21 ( to which @xmath22 belongs ) . this apparent asymmetry between @xmath21 and @xmath22 can not exist since there is no preferred direction on the torus .",
    "the restoration of the symmetry , based on the modular covariance , is the basis for the determination of the symmetry group of a particular theory .",
    "we have mentioned that @xmath22 must be in the centralizer @xmath26 of @xmath21 , which thus appears as the symmetry group that remains unbroken in the @xmath21sector ( so the periodic sector ( @xmath27 ) has the maximal symmetry , equal to @xmath18 itself ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that the partition function @xmath23 depends only on the conjugacy class of @xmath22 within @xmath26 , and on that of @xmath21 ( within @xmath18 ) . eliminating all redundancies , we obtain a ( in general non ",
    "square ) list of frustrated partition functions @xmath23 .",
    "we finish this introductory section by recalling the compatibility conditions that follow from putting together the modular transformations and the existence of a symmetry group .",
    "the presence of the affine symmetry implies that every space @xmath24 is made up of representations of a pair @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the level @xmath30 affine lie algebra based on @xmath31 ( @xmath32 or @xmath3 here ) _",
    "g = _ p , p p_++^(n ) m_p , p^(g ) ( _ p _ p ) , where the numbers @xmath33 are multiplicities ,",
    "_ i.e. _ non  negative integers .",
    "the shifted weights @xmath15 specify the inequivalent integrable representations of @xmath29 , and the height @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the dual coxeter number of @xmath31 .",
    "assume now that the theory has a symmetry group @xmath18 .",
    "it means that the generators of the affine lie algebra ( and of the virasoro algebra ) are @xmath18singlets .",
    "this in turn implies that the action of @xmath26 is block  diagonal on inequivalent representations occurring in @xmath24 , so that , for each pair @xmath15 , the @xmath33 equivalent affine representations carry a representation of @xmath26 . using the definition of the affine characters @xmath37 , one obtains z_g , g ( ) = _ p , p p_++^(n ) m_p , p^(g ) ( g ) ^*_p(q ) ^_p(q ) , [ tpf ] where @xmath38 is the character of a unitary representation of @xmath26 of degree @xmath39 . as an additional requirement",
    ", we will impose that the identity ( label @xmath40 ) appears in the periodic sector @xmath41 only and is invariant under @xmath18 , so that @xmath42",
    ".    for a fixed @xmath22 , say of order @xmath43 , this representation can be fully diagonalized , which then reveals the charges , defined modulo @xmath43 , of the individual representations m_p , p^(g ) ( g ) = _ k=1^m_p , p^(g ) _",
    "n^q(g;p , p;g;k ) , with @xmath44 . in most cases , the multiplicities @xmath33",
    "are equal to 1 , so that only one  dimensional representations are involved , from which charges can be read off in a straightforward way .    the frustrated partition functions ( [ tpf ] ) are subjected to strong constraints since they must be compatible with the modular transformations .",
    "these leave the torus invariant but mix the two periods , and hence the boundary conditions .",
    "the result is the following transformation formula z_g , g ( ) = z_g , gg(+1 ) = z_g^-1,g(-1 ) = z_g^ag^c , g^bg^d ( ) .",
    "[ tmod ] these are severe constraints , which allow to determine the possible symmetries ( and all frustrated partition functions ) compatible with a given theory ( a given mipf ) .    in practice , one starts from a supposedly known mipf @xmath45 . from it",
    "one tries to determine all @xmath46 , whose form ( in terms of affine characters ) is fixed by @xmath45 , and which themselves yield other functions @xmath23 by modular transformations .",
    "this set of functions is finally extended in a maximal way so as to obtain a table of functions @xmath23 which transform in the covariant way prescribed by ( [ tmod ] ) .",
    "the resulting table corresponds to the maximal symmetry group @xmath18 that is compatible with the theory specified by the initial mipf .",
    "this procedure has been used in @xcite in the case of minimal virasoro models .",
    "it must be emphasized that we assume throughout that the symmetry group preserves the affine algebra , which implies that all twisted sectors carry representations of the same symmetry algebra . with this in mind , the non  existence of a symmetry group can mean two things .",
    "either the theory really has no symmetry , or it does have one but which does not preserve the level of the chiral symmetry algebra from which we have chosen to look at the theory , in which case a lower , subalgebra point of view must be taken .",
    "the end of the previous section sketched the way the maximal symmetry group of a theory can be found . here",
    ", we make the procedure a bit more explicit , but more importantly , we discuss the various issues that need to be clarified before the symmetry group can be safely named .    the most obvious question is related to the fact that only pairs @xmath20 of commuting elements can be used . in a sense ,",
    "the non  abelian features of the group can not all be probed directly .",
    "a good starting point is to classify the cyclic symmetries , and their possible realizations there can be more than one , according to the scheme described above .",
    "being abelian groups , there is no restriction on @xmath47 , and their full structure can be exposed . since most theories ( in this paper ) have an abelian cyclic symmetry , this will be the complete story . in a few cases ,",
    "distinct cyclic symmetries or several realizations of a given cyclic symmetry will be found , indicating the existence of a larger group .",
    "two cyclic symmetries @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be assembled into @xmath50 if an action of @xmath48 can be consistently defined in the sectors labelled by the elements of @xmath49 , and vice  versa , i.e. if the two kinds of charges are simultaneously assignable .",
    "if not , the two cyclic factors are not commuting subgroups . in this way , one can list the maximal abelian subgroups and look for non  abelian groups that contain them ( and only them ) . in case",
    "several groups qualify , one should be able to pick the right one by looking at the various sectors @xmath24 and the associated data @xmath51 , which are to be characters of the centralizer @xmath26 .",
    "this procedure presumably leads to a unique group @xmath18 , as it has to match a number of data : the conjugacy classes and their centralizers , the maximal abelian subgroups , and the character tables of the centralizers ( maybe not the whole of them ) .",
    "subtleties or difficulties can however be encountered in the above analysis .    1 .   in looking for a cyclic symmetry ,",
    "we usually proceed by identifying the way it can be realized in the periodic sector .",
    "this yields the functions @xmath52 which , by modular transformations , allow to compute the complete table of partition functions @xmath23 for @xmath53 .",
    "when there is a unique function @xmath52 , this procedure produces a unique table of functions @xmath23 .",
    "this is however not enough to guarantee that the group @xmath48 itself is unique , and indeed it sometimes extends to a power @xmath54 .",
    "+ if there is a @xmath48 action in the periodic sector by one  dimensional representations ( i.e. all fields appear with a degeneracy equal to 1 ) , then @xmath52 gives the exact way the generator of @xmath48 acts .",
    "so if there is a unique function @xmath52 , there is also a unique @xmath48 action , and a unique @xmath48 . + this is no longer the case if higher  dimensional representations are involved , since @xmath52 sees only their trace .",
    "suppose that , among others , @xmath48 acts in the periodic sector by an @xmath55dimensional representation @xmath56 ( a field has multiplicity @xmath55 ; here , @xmath57 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "that the functions @xmath52 are unique means that , restricted to that block , any other @xmath48 must act by an @xmath55dimensional ( distinct ) representation @xmath58 that has the same character as @xmath56 .",
    "+ so if there is , say , a @xmath59 symmetry , all @xmath48 subgroups must act on this @xmath55by@xmath55 block with the same character .",
    "as it turns out , this implies that @xmath55 must be large enough for this to happen ( as we have seen above , @xmath55 can not be 1 ) , with in addition restrictions on the character . for @xmath60 , @xmath55 must be at least equal to 3 , and the character of the representations must be equal to @xmath61 . written in diagonalized form , the representations of the three @xmath62 subgroups of @xmath63 ( generated by @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) read : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath69 , the number @xmath55 must be bigger than 8 , and the representations must also have a trace equal to @xmath61 , a solution exists with @xmath70 and again a trace equal to @xmath61 .",
    "we suspect that this value of @xmath55 is minimal . ] . + as mentioned above , @xmath55 is at most 3 in the models considered here , so that @xmath62 is the only symmetry that can potentially be extended , requiring in addition a trace equal to @xmath61 .",
    "but the only model which has a @xmath62 symmetry and a multiplicity equal to 3 is @xmath71 ( height 6 ) , for the partition function @xmath72 , where a cyclic symmetry @xmath62 indeed leads to a @xmath73 group , the two factors being conjugate within a bigger group , namely @xmath74 .",
    "the action is precisely given by the three matrices given above .",
    "the details for the determination of the functions @xmath75 are given in section 3.3.1 .",
    "the last step in the procedure described above may not work .",
    "indeed the list of all maximal abelian subgroups poses no problem , but there is no guarantee that a single group can accomodate them all . in other words , there may not be a unique maximal symmetry group , but several ones ( possibly isomorphic ) . that this occurs can be taken as an indication that different models exist , which all share the same modular invariant partition function . +",
    "the only case where we have seen this situation occur is again in @xmath71 , for the partition function @xmath72 .",
    "there we found two isomorphic maximal symmetry groups @xmath76 , the alternating group on four letters .",
    "the two groups @xmath74 have @xmath77 and @xmath73 as maximal abelian subgroups , but carry a different realization of the @xmath77 factor .",
    "the existence of these two symmetry groups is paralleled by the existence of two isospectral graphs , naturally associated to the modular invariant partition function , and reproducing correctly the characters found in the periodic sector @xmath41 ( see section 3.3.1 for more details ) .",
    "+ these elements give some support to the existence of two different models with the same torus partition function @xmath72 .",
    "the last issue we want to mention is the possibility that the symmetry group acts on the various sectors by projective representations .",
    "this possibility can be easily accounted for if one bears in mind that a projective action modifies the modular transformations of the partition functions .",
    "+ let us suppose that @xmath18 , in fact @xmath26 , acts on the sector @xmath24 by a projective representation @xmath78 , characterized by a 2cocycle @xmath79 : r_g ( h ) r_g ( h ) = _ g(h , h ) r_g(hh ) , h , h c(g ) . + for such representations , the partition functions @xmath23 transform differently from ( [ tmod ] ) , since the composition of group elements is involved .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the transformation rules are now z_g , g ( ) = _ g ( g , g ) z_g , gg(+ 1 ) = _ g^-1(g , g^-1 ) z_g,g^-1 ( -1 ) .",
    "[ pmod ] + let us remark that one should in general expect the various cocycles @xmath79 to be cohomologically trivial . in the sector @xmath80",
    ", the action of @xmath26 is block diagonal with respect to the inequivalent affine representations .",
    "so , unless all occurring representations have multiplicity bigger than 1 , some of the blocks will correspond to one ",
    "dimensional @xmath79projective representations .",
    "this implies that @xmath79 is a coboundary .",
    "+ although we were not so much interested in projective representations , they were somehow forced on us in a number of cases , where an expected symmetry , present in the graphs , was not seen to be realized in the field theory , but could however be realized projectively .",
    "this situation occurs for a @xmath62 group in all diagonal @xmath2 models for an odd height ( the @xmath81 , @xmath34 odd , theories ) , and the @xmath82 and @xmath83 models of @xmath3 . in the @xmath84 models of @xmath3",
    ", it combines with a @xmath77 symmetry to form a projective @xmath85 . to our knowledge , this is the first instance of such a situation .",
    "the orbifold construction is well  known ( see for instance @xcite ) , and roughly speaking , corresponds to quotienting a theory @xmath86 by its symmetry group @xmath18 ( or subgroup ) . the resulting , orbifold theory @xmath87 may or may not be different from @xmath86 itself .    in some cases ,",
    "most notably when the group @xmath18 is abelian , the orbifold theory share the same symmetry as the original one , which can be recovered by orbifolding the orbifold theory .",
    "so the two theories , considered with all their twisted sectors , are essentially equivalent .    when @xmath18 is non  abelian , the symmetry of the orbifold theory is smaller , and equal to the abelianization of @xmath18 , namely @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the commutator subgroup @xcite . the torus modular invariant partition function of the orbifold theory , z_e , e^orb = 1 |g| _ g g _ g c(g ) z_g , g = 1 |g| _ [ g ] |[g]| _ g c(g ) z_g , g , [ orb ] collects , from all sectors of the original theory , the fields which are singlets under @xmath18 ( @xmath90|$ ] is the cardinal of the class of @xmath21 , and the first summation is over the classes of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the formula ( [ orb ] ) is not the only way to obtain a modular invariant partition function .",
    "distinct orbits under the modular group can be given different coefficients and the result is still modular invariant . that the invariant is a modular invariant partition function puts further restrictions which have been examined in @xcite : the different possibilities are classified by the second cohomology group @xmath91 and lead to what is known as discrete torsion .",
    "take a 2cocycle @xmath92 on @xmath18 , and define _",
    "g(g ) = ( g , g ) ( g,g)^-1 . for each @xmath21 ,",
    "the function @xmath93 is a ( true ) representation of @xmath26 , which can then be used to define the orbifold modular invariant partition function z_e , e^orb = 1 |g| _ g g _",
    "g(g ) z_g , g. [ torb ] clearly , this new function corresponds to a projection , in each sector @xmath24 , onto the fields which transform according to @xmath94 .    in this paper ,",
    "our emphasis is not on the orbifold construction , except that we use it as a cross  check on the frustrated partition functions we find . at the same time",
    ", we will compare what the orbifold procedure gives at the level of the graphs , confirming that the graph associated to the orbifold theory is the orbifold graph .",
    "the only model where there is some room for discrete torsion is , once more , the @xmath95 models of @xmath3 , since the symmetry group of all other models has a trivial cohomology @xmath96 .",
    "details about these models are given in section 3.3.1 , where the discrete torsion yields nothing new compared to the ordinary orbifold construction .",
    "graphs lie at the heart of the structure of the @xmath2 theories .",
    "let us recall that each @xmath2 modular invariant @xmath97 can be uniquely associated with a graph @xmath98 , in this case an ade dynkin diagram , such that the diagonal terms of @xmath97 can be recovered from the graph spectral data @xcite .",
    "although the graph does not specify , in a direct way , the whole modular invariant , it does give it implicitely through the modular invariance itself ( no distinct modular invariants are known that share the same diagonal terms ) .",
    "it remains a remarkable observation that the full set of consistent @xmath2 theories is simply the ade list .",
    "the same observation applies to the virasoro minimal models , for which the graphs are in fact pairs of graphs , closely related to an a dynkin diagram and an ade dynkin diagram ( with a restriction on the number of nodes ) .",
    "the generalization of these ideas to other models has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is always a mipf , for which one tries to put the diagonal terms in correspondence with a graph or a collection of graphs .",
    "as shown the most clearly in @xcite , the connection gets even more significance if one phrases it in terms of an @xmath99representation of the fusion algebra .",
    "we briefly recall the correspondence ( a more complete account of the many appearances of graphs in various contexts can be found in @xcite ) .    in a theory with identical chiral and antichiral algebras ,",
    "let @xmath100 be a label for the chiral primary fields , with the label 0 for the identity .",
    "the primary fields satisfy a fusion algebra with positive integer structure constants @xmath101 .",
    "the matrices @xmath102 themselves satisfy the fusion algebra , and are all diagonalized by the modular @xmath103 matrix . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath104 are given by the set @xmath105 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath97 is the modular invariant partition function of that theory on the torus .",
    "if we write the diagonal terms of @xmath97 as z = _ i |_i|^2 + , the set @xmath106 contains all labels @xmath100 ( with possible multiplicity ) such that the periodic sector contains the non  chiral scalar field @xmath107 .",
    "given the set @xmath106 , one looks for a @xmath99representation @xmath108 of the fusion algebra , of dimension @xmath109 , such that the eigenvalues of @xmath108 are determined from @xmath106 : n_i = \\{s_ij s_0j : j } .",
    "the regular representation of the fusion algebra , @xmath110 , is always a solution , that corresponds to @xmath106 equal to the whole set of available labels , and thus to the diagonal modular invariant .",
    "all matrices @xmath108 have positive integer entries , and so can be viewed as adjacency matrices of graphs ( having @xmath109 nodes ) .",
    "since the fusion algebra has usually a restricted number of generators , the diagonal structure of @xmath97 can eventually be associated with a restricted number of fundamental graphs . for @xmath2 , one generator ,",
    "hence one graph , is sufficient . for @xmath3 ,",
    "one needs two generators , and so two ( oriented ) graphs , but the conjugation implies that the two adjacency matrices are the transpose of each other ( the two graphs differ by their orientation ) .",
    "therefore , both in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the information can be condensed in a single graph .",
    "we will denote its adjacency matrix by @xmath111 .",
    "remarkably , all @xmath99representations are known in the case of the @xmath2 fusion algebras @xcite . at height @xmath112 , the only ( irreducible )",
    "solutions correspond to taking for @xmath111 , the generator of the fusion ring , the adjacency matrix of all ade lie algebras with coxeter number equal to @xmath113 or the adjacency matrix of the tadpole graph t with @xmath113 nodes .",
    "only the ade diagrams correspond to sets @xmath106 which are realized in modular invariants .",
    "all representations based on t , and direct sums of adet diagrams are spurious in the sense that their set @xmath106 does not correspond to a modular invariant .",
    "those solutions are thus discarded .",
    "for @xmath3 , the authors of @xcite propose a tentative list of graphs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for each modular invariant , they found at least one graph with the right properties , but the novelty , as compared to @xmath2 , is that in a few cases , several isospectral graphs exist .",
    "it is presently not known whether this list is exhaustive .    in general",
    ", a representation @xmath108 may have a symmetry , in the sense that permutations @xmath114 of @xmath106 leave the representation invariant ( n_i)_(j)^(k ) = ( n_i)_j^k , i. when the representation is given in terms of a single matrix , or one graph , its symmetry group is just the automorphism group of that single graph . in the regular representation ,",
    "the symmetries of the ( fusion ) graphs are given by simple currents .",
    "one of our motivations for this work is precisely to see if the relevance of the graphs can be further probed by taking the point of view of symmetries . as far as graphs are concerned",
    ", our purpose will be to see if the symmetry data we find in the conformal theories coincide with those we get from the graphs .",
    "that question has been answered positively for @xmath115 and @xmath116 both odd .",
    "strangely , the expected @xmath62 symmetry does not even seem to be realized projectively . ] in the case of the minimal models , both on the torus @xcite and on the cylinder @xcite where the role played by the graphs in the way boundary conditions behave under the symmetry was investigated .",
    "we will see here that it is still largely true in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models , though we found a few cases where the cft and the graph picture do not quite match .",
    "the highlights of this comparison are collected in section 3.2 .",
    "we should close this section by stressing that the connection with graphs goes beyond the diagonal terms of a mipf , in at least five ways .",

    "the results , in the form of a list of groups and of partition functions which specify the contents of the twisted sectors and the way these groups act on the fields , have been reported in section 3.1 , see also the tables 1 to 3 .    however a strong motivation for this work was to see if the symmetries present in the field theories , and the representations carried by the various sectors , are in some way encoded in the graphs that have been associated with these theories . indeed the many points of view that have been taken over the last ten years have consistently shown that these graphs govern many fundamental aspects of those models .",
    "hence our second purpose was to examine and to probe the relevance of the graphs from symmetry considerations .    in this respect ,",
    "a rather firm conclusion is that , as expected , the graphs indeed have much to say about the symmetries and their realizations in the field theories .",
    "this is especially true for the affine @xmath2 models , where the matching is complete ( provided one allows for projective representations ) .",
    "surprisingly perhaps , this is less so for the @xmath3 models , where in many cases the graphs have symmetries ( automorphisms ) unmatched in the field theories .",
    "however , taken in the other way , the connection works nicely and universally , since a symmetry in the field theory always has a counterpart in the graph ( except for the non  colourable graphs in @xmath3 , for known reasons ) .",
    "in addition the content of the twisted sectors and the way the symmetry is represented in them can be recovered from the graph , thereby extending what the graphs had been devised for in the first place , namely the coding of the diagonal terms in a modular invariant .",
    "most of these features have remained mere observations .",
    "the investigation of the symmetry features of these models in a cylindric geometry would certainly form a natural continuation of this work .",
