    "this paper considers a graph reduction process formalizing gene assembly in strichotrichous ciliates .",
    "we briefly survey this background before describing the combinatorial formalization .",
    "the biological background is not necessary elsewhere in the paper .",
    "strichotrichous ciliates are ancient unicellular eukaryotes possessing two distinct types of cell nuclei , called the macronucleus and the microncleus .",
    "the macronucleus is the somatic nucleus , while the micronucleus is a germline nucleus that is used to transmit genes to offspring during sexual reproduction .",
    "genes in the micronucleus are located on long molecules consisting of coding blocks separated by non - coding material .",
    "these coding blocks must be assembled into their `` orthodox order '' during reproduction . in the micronucleus ,",
    "however , the blocks may be shuffled , and some may be inverted .",
    "the necessary data to assemble these blocks into the orthodox order are encoded in short nucleotide sequences called pointers , located at each end of each coding block . in effect , the coding blocks may be regarded as nodes in a doubly linked list , with the pointers at the ends of each block indicating which block precedes it and which block follows it in the orthodox order .",
    "the process of reading these pointers and assembling the blocks into the orthodox order is called the gene assembly process , and it is an example of what could be considered computation in living cells .",
    "background on strichotrichous ciliates and the gene assembly process may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a thorough treatment of the gene assembly process and its various formalizations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the formalization we consider comes from an intramolecular model for gene assembly , which is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several mathematical formalizations for the intramolecular model are described in @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward formalization makes use of signed double - occurence strings : the sequence of pointers is described by a string in which each letter occurs exactly twice , and each letter is given a sign to indicate whether or not it is inverted .",
    "such strings are also called _ legal strings_. this formalization is studied further in @xcite and @xcite . the formalization which we consider uses signed graphs , which can be obtained from legal strings as follows : the vertex set is the set of letters in the string ;",
    "two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding letters `` interlock '' in the string ( i.e. they appear in the patter @xmath1 , rather than @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) ; a vertex is assigned the sign @xmath4 if it appears both inverted and non - inverted in the string , and @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "although it may appear that some information is lost in converting strings to graphs , it is demonstrated in @xcite that no essential information is lost , in the sense that assembly strategies in one formalization correspond to assembly strategies in the other .",
    "it is not the case , however , that all signed graphs arise from legal strings .",
    "further discussion of the legal string and signed graph formalizations , and the relation between them , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the intramolecular model postulates that gene assembly is achieved by applying a sequence of three basic molecular operations , denoted @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "these correspond , in the legal string and signed graph formalizations , to combinatorial operations called the _ negative rule _ , _ positive rule _ and _",
    "double rule_. in the graph formalization , each rule shrinks the vertex set of the graph by one or two vertices , and reconfigures the edges between the remaining vertices .",
    "the gene assembly process is complete when the graph has been reduced to the empty graph .",
    "these three combinatorial operations are the basis of the graph reductions which we study in this paper .",
    "we shall refer to the graph formalization of the three molecular operations as _ combinatorial reduction rules _ , and compositions of them will be called _ combinatorial graph reductions _ , or simply _",
    "graph reductions_. a _ successful _ graph reduction is a reduction of a graph to the empty graph .",
    "the basic problems about the graph formalization of gene assembly concern understanding the different sequences of combinatorial reductions rules in a graph that produce a successful reduction .",
    "in particular , one wishes to understand how to measure the complexity of a given signed graph from the standpoint of combinatorial graph reduction .",
    "several measures of complexity are proposed and analyzed in @xcite . in particular",
    ", one can ask if a given graph can be reduced to the empty graph using only some subset of the three operations ; a classification is given in @xcite for those graphs which can be reduced without the positive rule , and those which can be reduced without the double rule ; this paper completes that classification by classifying the graphs which can be reduced without the negative rule ( section [ nullitysection ] ) . an active topic",
    "recently concerns the _ parallel complexity _ of a signed graph .",
    "the parallel complexity of a signed graph is the number of steps needed to reduce it to the empty graph , if it is permitted to perform a set of operations simultaneously if and only if they could be applied in any order with the same result .",
    "parellel complexity is studied for various families of graphs in @xcite and @xcite , and the computational problem of determining a graph s parallel complexity is considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is not known whether parallel complexity can be computed in polynomial time .",
    "surprisingly , no nontrivial bounds are known for the parallel complexity of a graph with a given number of vertices .",
    "it is not even known whether parallel comlexity is unbounded for general graphs ; it is conjectured in @xcite that in fact parallel complexity is bounded by a constant for all graphs .",
    "this paper demonstrates that all of these questions can be formulated in linear algebraic terms by considering the adjacency matrix of the graph over @xmath0 , where the sign of a vertex is encoded by regarding positive vertices as having loops .",
    "this idea has also been pursued in @xcite .",
    "we generalize a result from @xcite by demonstrating that the combinatorial reduction rules on signed graphs are path - invariant , in the sense that the result of removing a given subset of vertices does not depend on the particular operations used to remove them ( theorem [ pathinvariance ] ) ; we also provide an algebraic criterion determining whether a given set of vertices can be removed ( proposition [ matrixreducibility ] ) .",
    "we prove that the number of times the negative rule is applied in a reduction to the empty graph is determined by the rank of the adjacency matrix ( theorem [ ngrnullity ] ) , thus classifying the graphs which can be reduced without this rule and resolving two problems posed in @xcite .",
    "the methods in this paper also suggest another way to encode the data of the possible reductions of a signed graph : by a poset .",
    "in particular , the set of subsets of vertices which can be removed without the negative rule ( equivalently , as we demonstrate , the subsets whose induced subgraph has invertible adjacency matrix ) forms a poset that we call the _ pivotal poset_. this poset completely determines the original graph ( theorem [ posetdeterminesgraph ] ) , and naturally encodes the sequences of steps that apply in parallel , thus suggesting a new approach to the study of parallel complexity .",
    "the notion of a graph pivot , first considered in the context of gene assembly in @xcite , is closely related to the methods of this paper . in particular , we characterize the pivot operation in terms of the pivotal poset . as an application of these ideas ,",
    "we describe and solve in section [ reversereductions ] what might be called the inverse problem for reductions of signed graphs : given a graph , which graphs can be reduced to it using combinatorial reduction rules ?    some of our results , in particular regarding path invariance of graph reductions , have been proved in weaker forms in @xcite , by means of the matrix pivot operation on the adjacency matrix . in effect , their work concerns what we refer to as _ nonsingular reduction _ , which can be characterized as those graph reductions which do not use the negative rule . in section",
    "[ pivots ] , we show this connection , and give a simple characterization of pivots of graphs in terms of the reducibility poset .",
    "our method generalizes some results from @xcite , and provides short proofs for others .",
    "we discuss the implications of the pivot operation for the reducibility poset . as a special case",
    ", we consider the _ retrograph _ of a graph , which can be defined by taking the inverse of the adjacency matrix , when it exists .",
    "we begin by describing the combinatorial reduction rules in section [ combinatorial ] .",
    "we generalize the reduction rules in [ algebraic ] using linear algebra over @xmath0 , and prove our path - invariance result .",
    "we demonstrate in section [ combminimal ] that the combinatorial reduction rules are simply the minimal graph reductions , and also give our results on the number of applications of the negative rule in a successful reduction . in section",
    "[ pivots ] we relate graph reductions to the matrix pivot operation , and describe the relation between pivots , the pivotal poset , and the graph reduction inverse problem .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we shall use the word _",
    "graph _ to refer to a simple graph with loops ( i.e. there is at most one edge between any two vertices , and vertices may have edges to themselves ) , and the _ adjacency matrix _ of a graph will always be understood to have coefficients in @xmath0 . when we refer to a _ signed graph _ ,",
    "we mean a simple graph without loops together with an assigned sign ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) for each vertex .",
    "these two notions are equivalent in the sense that the sign @xmath4 may be understood to indicate that the vertex has a loop edge .",
    "we begin by describing the graph reduction operations formalizing the three molecular operations . we shall refer to these reductions as _ combinatorial graph reductions _",
    ", in order to distinguish them from the definition of graph reductions that we give in the next section . in section [ combminimal ] we shall demonstrate that these two notions of graph reduction coincide .",
    "these reductions have been considered on signed graphs until now , so we present this viewpoint first .",
    "we then describe how these rules can be equivalently formulated on simple graphs with loops ( which we shall call , simply , _ graphs _ ) , and demonstrate that this leads to simple formulas for the reduction rules in terms of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the three molecular operations postulated by the intramolecular model are hi , dlad , and ld .",
    "each has a corresponding rule on signed graphs , defined as follows .    a _ signed graph _",
    "@xmath8 is a simple graph on vertices @xmath9 , with edges @xmath10 , such that each vertex is given a sign by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the neighborhood of @xmath13 in @xmath14 ( not including @xmath13 itself ) . by _",
    "complementing _ an edge @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are vertices , we mean adding an edge between @xmath17 and @xmath18 if one is not present , and removing the edge between @xmath17 and @xmath18 if one is present .",
    "the three combinatorial reduction rules on signed graphs are as follows .",
    "* @xmath19 , the _ graph positive rule _ applies if and only if @xmath20 .",
    "it removes @xmath13 from the graph , all edges among two vertices in @xmath12 are complemented , and the signs of all vertices in @xmath12 are inverted .",
    "* @xmath21 , the _ graph double rule _ applies if and only if @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it removes @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the graph , and complements all edges @xmath24 such that one of @xmath25 or @xmath26 lies in @xmath27 and the other in @xmath28 , but such that not both @xmath17 and @xmath18 lie in @xmath29 .",
    "signs are unaffected .",
    "* @xmath30 , the _ graph negative rule _ applies if and only if @xmath31 and @xmath13 is isolated ( has no neighbors ) .",
    "it removes @xmath13 , and does not affect the rest of the graph .    a _ combinatorial reduction strategy _ is a sequence @xmath32 of one or more combinatorial reduction rules . a combinatorial reduction strategy is called _ applicable _ if for @xmath33 , the rule @xmath34 applies to @xmath35 .",
    "the _ domain _ of a reduction strategy is the set of vertices removed by the strategy .",
    "a reduction strategy is called _ successful _ if it is applicable and its domain is all of @xmath36 .",
    "the composition @xmath37 of the rules of a combinatorial reduction strategy is called a _ combinatorial reduction_.    see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the monograph @xcite , for discussion of these three rules and their relation to the postulated molecular operations hi , dlad , and ld",
    ". we also point out that if we consider graphs with only negative vertices , the double rule @xmath38 is identical to the _ rank two reduction _ rule as considered in @xcite .",
    "an example of a successful reduction strategy of a signed graph , demonstrating the three rules , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there are other successful reduction strategies for this graph ( for example , vertex @xmath39 can be removed first , using the positive rule , see figure [ fig : pathinvarianceexample ] ) .",
    "all diagrams have been created using the gene assembly simulator @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "let @xmath40 be the graph corresponding to the matrix @xmath41 in figure [ fig : posets ] , and @xmath42 be the graph corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "note that of course the pivotal poset of @xmath42 is obtained by taking the symmetric set difference of each pivotal set in @xmath40 with @xmath44 .",
    "however , @xmath42 is nonsingular , whereas @xmath40 has nullity @xmath45 , thus the reducibility poset of @xmath40 includes singular sets ( namely @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are both in @xmath48 .",
    "this example shows that there can not in general be a bijection between the reducibility poset of a graph and the reducibility poset of its pivot , since these posets may have different sizes .",
    "if @xmath14 is a nonsingular graph ( that is , its entire vertex set @xmath36 is pivotal , which is to say that no combinatorial reductions strategies of @xmath14 use the negative rule ) , then we can consider the pivot of @xmath14 by its entire vertex set .",
    "the graph obtained in this way has interesting combinatorial properties , which we shall now consider .",
    "if @xmath14 is a graph with vertex set @xmath36 , and @xmath49 , then the _ retrograph _ @xmath50 of @xmath14 is the pivot by the entire vertex set , @xmath51 .",
    "the retrograph has two useful combinatorial properties , expressed by the following theorem .",
    "[ retrographtheorem ] if @xmath14 has retrograph @xmath50 , then any successful combinatorial reduction strategy of @xmath14 applies in reverse to @xmath50 .",
    "the retrograph @xmath50 is the unique graph with whose combinatorial reduction strategies are the same as those for @xmath14 in reverse .",
    "if @xmath52 is a subset of the vertices of @xmath14 , then @xmath53 is reducible in @xmath14 if and only if @xmath54 is reducible in @xmath50 , and in this case @xmath55 .",
    "the statement that a successful combinatorial reduction strategy of @xmath14 applies in reverse to @xmath50 is equivalent to the statement that a subset of the vertices of @xmath14 is reducible in @xmath14 if and only if its complement is reducible in @xmath50 .",
    "this latter statement is equivalent to @xmath56 , which is true by the definition of the pivot of a graph .",
    "the statement @xmath55 follows from equation [ pivotsofreductions ] by letting the sets @xmath57 in the statement of equation [ pivotsofreductions ] be the sets @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "observe that the combinatorial description of @xmath50 ( the graph whose successful combinatorial reduction strategies are the combinatorial reductions strategies of @xmath14 applied in reverse ) can not be used to describe an analogous retrograph for singular graphs @xmath14 .",
    "this is because @xmath56 implies that , since @xmath59 is pivotal in any graph , the whole vertex set @xmath36 must be pivotal in @xmath14 in order for @xmath50 to be well - defined .",
    "thus the retrograph , defined by this combinatorial property , exists if and only if @xmath14 is nonsingular .",
    "the first part of this theorem shows the first use of the retrograph : it allows us to look ahead and immediately see how a graph reduction strategy must end , without actually computing the entire reduction strategy .",
    "the second part of the theorem shows that , in some sense , the retorgraph reduces the study of reductions of a given graph to the study of subgraphs of the retrograph .",
    "more precisely , if we wish to verify some statement on the result of every reduction of @xmath14 , and we can formulate the statement in such a way that it is easy to verify on the retrograph , then we can simply verify this latter statement on all subgraphs of the retrograph , and avoid computing any reductions .",
    "we also observe that theorem [ retrographtheorem ] can be restated in terms of the adjacency matrix to obtain an interesting matrix identity .",
    "in fact , this identity holds for matrices over any field , by considering pair - classes over fields other than @xmath0 .",
    "it may also be proved directly by algebra .    if @xmath41 is an invertible @xmath60 matrix",
    ", @xmath36 is the set @xmath61 , regarded as both the set of rows and the set of columns , and @xmath62 , then @xmath63 is invertible if and only if @xmath64 is invertible . in this case , if @xmath41 is written in block form as @xmath65}$ ] with @xmath66 , then the matrix @xmath64 is equal to @xmath67 .",
    "we illustrate the retrograph concept with a simple example .",
    "consider the graph and retrograph shown in figure [ fig : retrograph ] .",
    "c||c @xmath68 & @xmath69 +   +   +   and its retrograph @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ] &   and its retrograph @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we show in figure [ fig : retroreduction ] one successful reduction strategy of this graph , and show the retrograph of the result at each stage .",
    "observe that , in keeping with theorem [ retrographtheorem ] , these retrographs of reductions are simply induced subgraphs of the original retrograph .    c||c @xmath70 & @xmath71 + & + , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] & , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   +   + @xmath72 & @xmath73 + & + , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] & , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   +   + @xmath74 & @xmath75 + & + , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] & , with retrographs at each stage.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      graph pivots also provide a simple characterization of what might be called the inverse problem for graph reductions : given a graph @xmath14 , which graphs @xmath76 can be transformed into @xmath14 by a graph reduction ?",
    "consider first the case where @xmath76 can be transformed to @xmath14 by a nonsingular reduction .",
    "if @xmath36 are the vertices of @xmath14 , and @xmath53 the other vertices of @xmath76 , we can express this by writing @xmath77 . by theorem [ pivotreduction ] , this is equivalent to @xmath78 . denoting by @xmath79 the graph @xmath80 , and recalling that @xmath81",
    ", we have the following bijection ( once we fix a set @xmath53 disjoint from @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath82    on the left side of equation [ reverse1 ] , @xmath79 ranges over all graphs on vertices @xmath83 .    in general ,",
    "@xmath76 can be reduced to @xmath14 if and only if there is a nonsingular reduction from @xmath76 to a union of @xmath14 with some number of isolated negative vertices .",
    "if @xmath14 is any graph with vertices @xmath36 , and @xmath53 is a set of vertices disjoint from @xmath36 , then the set of graphs @xmath76 on vertices @xmath83 such that @xmath84 is precisely @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ranges over all subsets of @xmath53 and @xmath79 ranges over all graphs on vertices @xmath83 such that @xmath87 and all vertices in @xmath88 do not have loops and are not adjacent to any vertices in @xmath36 .",
    "suppose @xmath89 satisfies the given conditions .",
    "then clearly @xmath88 is reducible in @xmath90 , since all these vertices are negative and isolated .",
    "thus by theorem [ pathinvariance ] , @xmath53 is reducible in @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , since there exists a combinatorial reduction strategy from @xmath76 to @xmath90 , and the remaining vertices @xmath88 can be removed by the negative rule to obtain @xmath14 , which is then equal to @xmath91 .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath76 is a graph on vertices @xmath83 such that @xmath92 and @xmath84 . then if @xmath86 is a maximal subset of @xmath53 nonsingular in @xmath76 , @xmath93 must be @xmath94 , hence reducing @xmath86 results in the disjoint union of @xmath14 and a collection of isolated negative vertices .",
    "hence @xmath76 has the desired form .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced new algebraic methods for the study of the graph formalization of gene assembly , demonstrating in particular the close relation between combinatorial graph reductions and linear algebra over @xmath0 , and giving combinatorial interpretations to the binary rank of a graph and the inverse of its adjacency matrix .",
    "our general definition of reducibility and graph reduction , together with the path invariance property , shed light on the relation between the three combinatorial reduction rules .",
    "some of this relation had been uncovered in @xcite , although our methods successfully incorporate the negative rule into the analysis and approach the problem using different methods .",
    "we have also generalized results from @xcite on the pivot operation and its relation to graph reductions , particularly the special case which we call the retrograph .",
    "we believe in particular that our approach of considering matrix pivots by means of pair - classes of matrices may shed considerable light on the properties of pivots of graphs .",
    "finally , the reducibility poset and pivotal poset give a new and useful way to phrase many problems about graph reductions , in particular regarding the study of parallel complexity .",
    "the most mysterious aspect of our method in this paper is the relation between the pivotal poset @xmath95 and the other levels @xmath96 of the reducibility poset of a graph .",
    "theorem [ posetdeterminesgraph ] demonstrates that the pivotal poset completely determines the other levels of the reducibility poset , but the method of recovered the latter from the former is rather cumbersome .",
    "in particular , it seems difficult to understand the effect of pivot operations on the full reducibility poset .",
    "it is possible that some restricted class of pivot operations are better behaved in this regard .",
    "a more combinatorial way of stating the difficulties described above is that very little is currently understood about when negative rules may occur in the course of a combinatorial reduction strategy .",
    "the original problem which led to this paper was the verification that the _ number _ of times the negative rule occurs in a successful reduction is a graph invariant , but presumably much more could be said about the places in a reduction strategy that the negative rule could occur .",
    "all this essentially amounts to understanding the structure of the full reducibility poset .",
    "although pair - classes of matrices were extremely convenient in studying pivot operations on graphs , it seems that they are the wrong structure to consider pivots and graph reductions .",
    "first , the fact that pivots of symmetric matrices remain symmetric appears to be somewhat coincidental ; a more natural formulation of pivots might make this fact obvious . a more intrinsic way of stating this criticism is to observe that the adjacency matrix should be viewed as a symmetric bilinear form , not as a linear transformation , as was made vivid in section [ algebraic ] .",
    "the correct definition of the pivot operation should more explicitly respect this aspect of the adjacency matrix .",
    "if such a definition can be found , it might more naturally subsume the intrinsic definition of graph reductions made in section [ algebraic ] , and perhaps illuminate the difficulties mentioned in relating the pivotal poset to the full reducibility poset .",
    "the notion of the retrograph , which can easily be defined intrinsically , may be critical to this problem .",
    "the pivot operation may be regarded as interpolating between the concepts of graph reduction and the retrograph , since the retrograph is a special case , and graph reductions appear as subgraphs of pivots",
    ". thus a more natural definition of the pivot of a graph would presumably interpolate between our definitions in section [ algebraic ] and some intrinsic definition of the retrograph .",
    "we have laid some groundwork for an investigation of parallel complexity using algebraic methods .",
    "the following problems , to which these methods might be useful , remain open .",
    "these questions can also be stated in terms of the reducibility poset of a graph , or equivalently in terms of ranks of submatrices of the adjacency matrix .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the largest parallel complexity of a signed graph on at most @xmath98 vertices .",
    "is @xmath97 bounded by a constant ? if not , what is its asymptotic behavior as @xmath98 approaches infinity ?",
    "what if @xmath97 instead denotes the largest parallel complexity of a graph on @xmath98 negative vertices ?",
    "it has been conjectured in @xcite that the function @xmath97 is in fact bounded by a constant .",
    "the best known upper bound is linear in @xmath98 .    given a graph @xmath14 on @xmath99 negative vertices , partitioned into @xmath98 edges @xmath100 on disjoint vertex sets , is there an efficient algorithm to determine whether the @xmath98 double rules @xmath101 removing these edges apply in parallel ?",
    "both these questions could also be asked in terms of average behavior . of course",
    "both of the following problems are not currently well - posed , since various probability distributions could be chosen in both cases .    what is the average parallel complexity of a signed graph on @xmath98 vertices ?    if @xmath98 disjoint edges @xmath102 between negative vertices are fixed , and edges between the vertices of the @xmath103 are either added or not added at random , what is the probability that the @xmath98 double rules @xmath101 removing these edges apply in parallel ?",

    "<S> we describe a graph reduction operation , generalizing three graph reduction operations related to gene assembly in ciliates . </S>",
    "<S> the graph formalization of gene assembly considers three reduction rules , called the positive rule , double rule , and negative rule , each of which removes one or two vertices from a graph . </S>",
    "<S> the graph reductions we define consist precisely of all compositions of these rules . </S>",
    "<S> we study graph reductions in terms of the adjacency matrix of a graph over the finite field @xmath0 , and show that they are path invariant , in the sense that the result of a sequence of graph reductions depends only on the vertices removed . </S>",
    "<S> the binary rank of a graph is the rank of its adjacency matrix over @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the binary rank of a graph determines how many times the negative rule is applied in any sequence of positive , double , and negative rules reducing the graph to the empty graph , resolving two open problems posed by harju , li , and petre . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the close relation between graph reductions and the matrix pivot operation , both of which can be studied in terms of the poset of subsets of vertices of a graph that can be removed by a graph reduction .    _ </S>",
