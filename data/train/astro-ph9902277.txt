    "in hierarchical theories of structure formation , clusters of galaxies form from the high peaks in the original density field , thus they provide crucial constraints on the shape , amplitude , and temporal evolution of the primordial mass fluctuation spectrum . despite their importance , the statistics for the abundance of high - z ( @xmath100.5 ) clusters are poor since they are so difficult to locate .",
    "optical surveys of distant galaxy clusters are well known to have serious statistical shortcomings such as effects of superpositions of unvirialized systems ( see among others @xcite ; @xcite ) . in addition , at high redshifts it becomes difficult to detect enhancements in the galaxy surface density against the overwhelming field galaxy population ( see @xcite for the success rate of optical high - z cluster searches ) .",
    "one of the cleanest ways to avoid sample contamination is the selection of high - z clusters by means of their x - ray emission .",
    "x - ray surveys are sensitive enough to detect distant clusters .",
    "examples include ms1137@xmath1166 , at z@xmath00.78 and ms1054@xmath803 at z@xmath00.83 in the medium survey ( @xcite and @xcite ; see also the detailed study on ms1054@xmath803 by @xcite ) .",
    "other x - ray surveys being conducted with rosat archive data are also finding distant clusters , for example the warps cluster at 0.83 ( rxj0152.7 - 1357 , ebeling et al . 1998 ) and the clusters discovered in the rdcs survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rdcs holds the record for the most distant x - ray selected cluster known at z@xmath121.26 ( rosati et al .",
    "these x - ray surveys are demonstrating that they can go as deep as optical searches in locating distant clusters .",

    "our group at the institute for astronomy in has been involved for several years in the optical identification of all the sources found in 84.7 deg@xmath13 centered at the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , @xcite ) .",

    "( 1997 ) paper was limited to only 12 cluster members but there was already an indication ( see their fig .",

    "very high - redshift x - ray selected clusters , such as the one presented here , are important to study .",
    "optically selected clusters tend to be under - luminous x - ray sources ( @xcite and reference therein ) , an indication that generally they are not massive objects .",
    "as more accurate observing capabilities become available , the number of distant known clusters will steadily increase , and the counts may severely constrain cosmological models . however , we are still far from having large complete samples of high - z clusters to test the predictions of cosmic structure formation theories at these redshifts .    throughout this paper ,",

    "we present the optical spectroscopy performed at keck - ii and the x - ray follow - up observations acquired with the hri on rosat and with the asca satellite .",
    "we first describe the optical spectroscopy which gives a very high value for the velocity dispersion",
    ". then we present the asca spectra which show that  has a temperature commensurate with its bolometric luminosity but not with its velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , we describe in detail the hri data and present an x - ray image revealing a morphology which is elongated in the same direction as the optical galaxies .",
    "the region of  was observed spectroscopically on july 10 and 11 , 1997 , with the low resolution and imaging spectrograph ( lris , @xcite ) and slit - masks on the keck - ii telescope .",
    "the 300 l / mm grating blazed at 5000   combined with our grating angle yielded a wavelength coverage of approximately 4500   to 9500  , and a pixel size of 2.45  .",
    "a gg495 filter was used to eliminate the overlapping second order spectrum so as not to have any contamination blueward of 9500  .",
    "given the fact that galaxies are extended objects even at this redshift , we have used a slit of 1.5 in width , which gives a reduced spectral resolution of 16  . for the selection of the objects to observe , we have used a very deep 3 color ( b , r and i ) image kindly supplied by doug clowe and published in clowe et al .",
    "the ucsclris package designed by drew phillips and collaborators at lick observatory was used to prepare the slit - mask files .",
    "we designed four masks at different position angles in order to cover the central part of the cluster .",
    "the four masks were exposed for 10,350s , 10,800s , 13,500s and 10,300s respectively .",
    "after each mask , exposure flat fields and arc calibrations were also obtained .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard iraf package routines for 2-d spectra images .    some of the objects were observed more than once in different masks . in the end , out of 62 unique objects observed , 37 proved to be cluster member galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in the cluster are marked in figure  [ image ] and listed in table 1 .",
    "for each galaxy the ( j2000 ) coordinates , measured velocity , 1@xmath17 error , and redshift are given .",

    "the velocity histogram for the 37 member galaxies is shown in figure  [ vel_hist ] . using the timothy beers program , rostat",
    ", we obtain an average redshift and velocity dispersion ( corrected to first order for cosmological redshift by dividing by 1@xmath11z ) which are z@xmath00.8090@xmath50.0051 and @xmath21522@xmath3 km s@xmath4 . using different methods ( @xcite , @xcite ) we obtain the same velocity dispersion within the uncertainties .",
    "this high velocity dispersion was already noted by henry et al .",
    "1997 with only 12 galaxy redshifts ( the 37 cluster members presented here include the 12 cluster galaxies of henry et al .",
    "the old and new results are consistent with each other within the uncertainties .",
    "we will discuss the implications of the high velocity dispersion for this cluster in section 3 .",
    "we observed  with asca ( @xcite ) on june 9 and 11 , 1996 for 115,779 and 53,191 seconds respectively .",
    "the asca instrumentation consists of four independent detectors , two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) sensitive in the range 0.5@xmath89 kev ( 140 ev resolution at e@xmath06 kev ) , and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) with poorer energy resolution but with some efficiency up to 11 kev .",
    "the sis observations were performed in 2-ccd faint mode for high bit rate and bright mode for medium bit rate observations .",
    "the faint mode data are converted into bright mode data on the ground in order to combine them with the on - board bright mode data .",
    "thus all data analysis is performed on bright data .",
    "we used the eight independent data - sets to extract the data in the regions of interest and then combined the datasets in 2 groups , one for all the gis and one for all the sis , for the spectral analysis .",
    "data preparation was done using the software package xselect in ftools ( version v4.1 ) which allows selection of valid time intervals and removal of hot and flickering pixels .",
    "we used the newly reprocessed data of  as suggested by the asca processing team .",
    "the reprocessing was necessary since incorrect orbit files were used in the first processing .",
    "the orbit files contain a time history of asca s orbital parameters and the use of out - of - date files could cause reduced signal to noise and inaccurate fluxes . for the effective area and point spread function files we used the latest versions available ( xrt_ea_v2_0.fits and xrt_psf_v2_0.fits ) .",
    "clean x - ray event lists were extracted using a magnetic cut - off rigidity threshold of 6 gev c@xmath4 and the recommended minimum elevation angles and bright earth angles to reject background contamination ( day et al . 1995 ) .",
    "events were extracted from within circles of radii 2.5 arcmin ( siss ) and 6.25 arcmin ( giss ) .",
    "we rejected about 98% of cosmic ray events by using only sis chip data grades 0 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "light curves for each instrument were visually inspected to exclude , if present , intervals with high background or data dropouts .",
    "the individual sis response matrices were generated using `` sisrmg '' ( v 1.1 , april 97 version ) which takes into account the large time - dependence of various aspects of the sis instruments responses .",
    "the sis data were rebinned in the standard way to 512 channels applying bright2linear with the lowest 17 channels ( @xmath18 0.6 kev ) flagged as bad . to convert sis pha ( pulse height analyzer ) values to pi ( pulse invariants ) bins",
    "the file sisph2pi_110397.fits was used .",
    "the data were then regrouped so that no energy bin had fewer than 20 counts .",
    "local background estimates were taken rather than the deep background images supplied by the asca guest observer facility ( gof ) .",
    "even if the blank sky background subtraction gives a better statistical quality , in the local background subtraction both the particle and the galactic diffuse background are properly accounted for .",
    "the background spectra of  were extracted with the same filters and parameters used to extract the source data .",
    "background counts were extracted from within annuli centered on the source and with an inner radius of 6.25 ( 2.5 ) arcmin and outer radius of 11.25 ( 4 ) arcmin for the giss ( siss ) .",
    "the details for both observations are given in table 2 .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using xspec ( v10.0 ) from the software package xanadu ( @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , given the low statistics of our eight datasets ( 4 data - sets for each observation ) we fitted the spectral data , together with their respective response files , after grouping them into 2 groups ( one for the four giss and one for the four siss ) in order to allow for different values of the parameters fitting the gis and sis data .",
    "the gis data were fitted in the 0.8@xmath89 kev band and the sis data in the 0.6@xmath88 kev band .",
    "the spatial resolution of asca along with the low signal - to - noise of the data permitted only a global single - temperature ( @xcite ) model to be fitted to the data .",
    "for the gis dataset we fixed the hydrogen column density to the galactic value along the line of sight at the cluster position , n@xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xcite ) while it was left free for the sis dataset .",
    "the fitting procedure gave an anomalous measurement of an order of magnitude higher value for the n@xmath21 , which may reflect problems still present in the sis calibration ( see the web page http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/cal_probs.html ) .",
    "the normalizations for the four gis ( sis ) spectra were constrained to be the same .",
    "the parameters varied to provide a fit to 8 spectra were therefore the 2 independent normalizations , the hi value , a single emission - weighted temperature , and the iron abundance .",
    "a best - fit cluster rest frame temperature of @xmath1 kev was measured for the cluster gas and a value a@xmath22 for the metallicity .",
    "all the errors are at the 68% confidence levels ( 1 @xmath17 ) , and all the fits have an acceptable reduced @xmath23=1.05@xmath81.09 .",

    "in addition to filtering the raw event list , the code also produces maps of the expected hri particle background and the effective exposure time . in figure  [ xcontours ]",
    "we show the x - ray iso - intensity contours from the hri observation overlaid on an optical ccd image of the cluster .",
    "the hri counts image was smoothed with a gaussian filter of 5 arcsec width ( @xmath40 ) and then corrected for particle background events and exposure time variations .    as shown in figure  [ xcontours ] , the hri reveals that  is morphologically complex at x - ray wavelengths too .",
    "the emission is clearly extended over a scale of roughly 1 arcmin ( @xmath41 h@xmath42 kpc ) , and its shape is indicative of the non - regularity of this cluster .",
    "while the strongest emission originates from an almost circular peak whose location is consistent with the position of the cd , the lower flux contours show a pronounced centroid shift and become significantly elongated in the same ne - sw direction as the distribution of the galaxies .",
    "the elongated shape of the emission coincides qualitatively with the dark matter contours determined by clowe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ xcontours ] .      even if @xmath43 models applied to this cluster",
    "are poorly constrained , we will attempt in the following to extract an x - ray profile and derive an x - ray mass to compare to the weak lensing mass measured by clowe et al .",
    "a radial profile of the x - ray emission is obtained by summing the hri counts in concentric annuli of variable width centered on the peak of the x - ray emission and dividing by the area of the annuli .",
    "this is possible out to a radius of 125   ( @xmath121.03 h@xmath16 mpc at the cluster redshift ) at which point the profile becomes indistinguishable , within the noise , from the background level .",
    "the profile is then fit with a @xmath43 model ( @xcite ) described by the standard form @xmath44 , with s@xmath45  = central surface brightness , @xmath46 = core radius and @xmath43  =  slope parameter .",
    "the values of the best fit ( 90% confidence level ) are s@xmath45  = 3.24 @xmath47 erg @xmath20 s@xmath4 arcmin@xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath43 = 0.42@xmath50 .",
    "both the core radius and the @xmath43 parameter are poorly constrained given the irregular x - ray morphology .",
    "at the distance of the cluster this core radius corresponds to 56 h@xmath16 kpc with a similar size error ( from 5.7 to 106 kpc ) .",
    "the size of the core radius could indicate the presence of a cooling flow . however , there is no evidence for excess emission in the very core of the cluster , thus any cooling flow must be of marginal significance .",
    "the existence of a cooling flow in  would also be inconsistent with the emerging view that cooling flows form preferably in dynamically undisturbed clusters ( see peres among others ) .",
    "a fit of a point source plus the @xmath43 model to the data results in a contribution of less than 15% of the point - like component . to confirm or disprove the presence of a central excess a spectral - spatial fit would be required .",
    "this is not possible with the x - ray data in hand , we have nonetheless attempted to fit a 2-temperature model to the asca spectra .",
    "the addition of the second temperature model does not improve significantly the fit with respect to the 1-temperature model ( f - test probability less than 2% ) .",
    "small core radii ( less than 4050 kpc ) and small @xmath43 values ( @xmath12 0.5 ) , such as this cluster seems to possess , have been observed in other clusters ; see for instance ms1512@xmath113647 ( @xmath51 ( 42.6@xmath56.7 h@xmath16kpc ) , @xmath52 ; @xcite ) or ms0440@xmath110204 ( @xmath53 ( 26.7@xmath54.5 h@xmath16 kpc ) , @xmath54 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the small size of the core radii and @xmath43s for these x - ray selected clusters is an issue that will be investigated in future work .",
    "here we use these two correlated parameters to derive an estimate of the cluster mass .",
    "the mass determined using x - ray data does depend on assumptions involving spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium , thus some of the assumptions may not apply in this case .",
    "these assumptions are found to be valid on the average in n - body simulation studies of cluster formation by schindler ( 1996 ) and evrard et al .",
    "moreover , from extensive simulations evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that errors on cluster masses , using scaling relations between mass and temperature , are typically of the order of 20% even in cases , like , where some substructure is present .",
    "@xcite caution against the use of single - phase analyses with rosat data , since the presence of a cooling flow with distributed mass deposition implies that the central intracluster medium ( icm ) has a range of temperatures and densities at any particular radius : i.e. the icm is multi - phase .",
    "there is no evidence of any significant cooling flow in , thus we feel that the assumptions adopted for the deprojection outlined below are largely correct .",
    "we should bear in mind though that the derived quantities using the hri profile should be interpreted with some caution given the asymmetry of the x - ray contours map that suggest that  is not a well relaxed cluster .    from the hri surface brightness profile , assuming a constant temperature , we have derived the three - dimensional density distribution of the gas from the two - dimensional image .",
    "the integrated mass in all forms can then be derived as a function of radius directly from the equation of the hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath55 , \\label{mr}\\ ] ] the radial dependence of the gas density @xmath56 is given by the rosat hri observations .",
    "@xmath57 is the intracluster temperature , @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath59 is the proton mass",
    ". a constant intracluster gas temperature of 5.66 kev as measured by asca is assumed .",
    "our estimates for the gas and gravitational mass within 125(@xmath121.03 h@xmath16 mpc at the cluster redshift ) are ( 8.9@xmath60 h@xmath61 and ( 2.8@xmath62 h@xmath63 . the corresponding gas mass fraction , m@xmath64/m@xmath65=(31@xmath58)% h@xmath66 , is higher than found by other investigators ( 11@xmath825% h@xmath66 @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "more recently evrard ( 1997 ) has published a revised average value of 17% for the gas fraction using the above referenced compilations .",
    "there is not yet a consensus on the value of the hot gas to total mass ratio in clusters , and on the fact whether this ratio is really representative of the fraction of baryons in the universe .",
    "the measurements seem to indicate that the gas fraction may vary from cluster to cluster and may even vary in the same cluster as a function of radius ( see donahue 1998 ) .",
    "we compare now the total mass from x - rays to the mass derived from the gravitational shear signal by clowe et al .",
    "these authors find in roughly the same region ( their 500 h@xmath4kpc aperture corresponds to 1 mpc in our cosmology ) a value of ( 5.2@xmath51.8)@xmath67 h@xmath63 . the weak lensing mass is computed assuming the background galaxies lie on a sheet at z@xmath02 and is higher , even within the uncertainties , than the x - ray derived mass .",
    "we note however that the clowe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mass determination takes into account also the second clump of matter associated with the ne group of galaxies which is clearly separated in their mass distribution map from the main cluster mass ( see figure  [ xcontours ] ) .",
    "the x - ray gravitational mass comes only from the main optical clump centered on the cd .",
    "in addition the weak lensing center of mass of the main cluster is displaced with respect to the center of the light and x - ray peaks of the cluster ; it is located 27east and 11north of the cd ( see figure  [ xcontours ] ) but consistent within the uncertainties of the weak lensing positions .",
    "the weak lensing mass distribution also resembles a filament of structure elongated in the same direction as the chain of optical galaxies .",
    "in the following discussion we will focus on the implications of measured quantities such as the high velocity dispersion , or low temperature , rather than derived quantities such as the gravitational mass from the x - ray data .",
    "first we would like to note that using three completely different instruments ( rosat pspc , asca and rosat hri ) we obtain within the uncertainties a consistent flux for the cluster .",
    "this is more remarkable than it seems since one has to keep in mind that the discovery data of  consisted of only 33 net counts .",
    "there are not many x - ray selected clusters known at this high redshift ; the other published examples are the 2 clusters from the emss ( @xcite ) , ms1054@xmath803 at 0.83 and ms1137@xmath1166 at 0.78 ( @xcite ) .",

    "show a filamentary appearance in their optical morphology .",
    "the medium survey cluster has an optical elongation in the east - west direction with the hri contours extended over a region of about 1  in the same direction as the optical galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "also has an extended x - ray emission of about 1 , with the center of the x - rays on the cd galaxy and the elongation in the same direction as the optical galaxies .    similarly to ms1054@xmath803 ,   has a high velocity dispersion which can be interpreted as a signature of non - virialization",
    "however , differently from ms1054@xmath803 , we are dealing here with a rather cool cluster ( kt@xmath05.66 kev against kt@xmath012.3 kev ) .",

    "a large number of authors ( see table 5 in girardi et al . , 1996 , or table 2 in wu , fang and xu , 1998 , for an exhaustive list of papers on the subject ) have attempted to determine the @xmath73t@xmath70 using different cluster samples in order to test the dynamical properties of clusters . using the derived value from the hri data of @xmath43@xmath00.42 and the measured temperature of 5.7 kev from the asca data for the temperature of the gas in the equation @xmath74",
    "we obtain a velocity dispersion of about 600 km s@xmath4 . even assuming energy equipartition between the galaxies and the gas in the cluster ( @xmath43@xmath01 ) we still obtain a velocity dispersion much lower than measured ( @xmath12 929@xmath75 km s@xmath4 vs 1522 km s@xmath4 ) . in other words in an isothermal potential the mass distribution of the cluster does not correspond to the isotropic one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "this is rather at odds with results of hot , high - z clusters recently observed .",
    "the velocity dispersions of three high ( @xmath100.5 ) redshift clusters , ms1054@xmath803 , ms0016@xmath1116 and ms0451@xmath803 ( see discussion in donahue et al .",
    "1998 ) all reflect their temperatures according to the above equation with @xmath43@xmath01 .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have derived a best fit relation between the velocity dispersion and the x - ray temperature , with more than 30% reduced scatter with respect to previous work ( edge and stewart 1991 ; lubin and bahcall 1993 ; bird , mushotzky and metzler , 1995 ; wu , fang and xu 1998 , among others ) .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have taken into account distortions in the velocity fields , asphericity of the cluster or presence of substructures to derive their best fit relation , log(@xmath17)@xmath0(2.53@xmath50.04)+(0.61@xmath50.05)log(t ) .",
    "if we plug in the temperature of  in the above relation , the resulting velocity dispersion value is discrepant with what is measured .",
    "a temperature of 11.5@xmath76 kev would be expected for @xmath17=1522 km s@xmath4",
    ".    may be an example of cluster which has not reached virial equilibrium , its dynamical state may be in large part dominated by infall or merging and consequently the velocity dispersion is not representative of the virial temperature of the cluster .",
    "if  is actually composed of two or more distinct gravitational components the situation should be apparent from the velocity histogram ( which is gaussian from fig .",
    "2 ) , unless the separation of the cluster components is so small to be statistically of little significance .",
    "the high value of the velocity dispersion can be due to a number of causes .",
    "if there is any fraction of infalling galaxies which are bound to the cluster but not yet virialized , they could inflate the velocity dispersion .",
    "these galaxies in the cluster would be moving on radial orbits . to see if any substructure is present in the redshift space we have considered the galaxies in figure  [ image ] lying outside a circle ( 0.5 mpc radius ) centered on the cd , to the north - east and to the south - west of a dividing line passing through the cd with position angle of about @xmath11135  east of north .",
    "there are eleven galaxies to the ne ( labeled in table 1 as 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 25 ) and nine galaxies to the sw ( labeled 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 and 37 ) .",
    "the mean redshift of the galaxies to the ne is 0.8107@xmath50.0018 ( 1 @xmath17 on the mean ) , and the mean redshift of the galaxies to the sw is 0.8021@xmath50.0027 , which implies a difference in redshift between the two components of @xmath77z@xmath00.0086@xmath50.0032 ( 1425 km s@xmath4 in velocity space ) , a small effect that is significant at 2.65 @xmath17 .",
    "it might well be that galaxies are infalling towards the center of the cluster , and while some galaxies have already reached ( or crossed ) the core region , some others are still moving along radial orbits towards its center .",
    "we recall here that numerical simulations have shown that the universe is composed of a web of filaments and voids on the scale of hundreds of megaparsecs .",
    "the clusters of galaxies form at the intersections of these filaments and grow with time from quasi - spherical systems to the spherical objects that we observe today as gas , galaxies and dark matter potential wells .",
    "filamentary structures have been observed in less distant clusters ( i.e. a2125 , wang et al .",
    "1998 ; the abcg 85/87/89 complex , durret et al . 1998 ) . the initial formation of protoclusters",
    "is often described as matter flowing along filaments ( @xcite ) with the x - ray flux maximum at the impact point of two colliding streams of matter . in this scenario the hot gas and",
    "the galaxies would not be in hydrostatic equilibrium and the transient velocity dispersion could be higher than expected from a virialized system .",
    "we are probably witnessing this process in this very distant x - ray selected cluster , and  might be more properly called a protocluster .",
    "we are grateful to drew phillis and collaborators for the use of his ucsclris package and to timothy beers for the use of his rostat program to calculate velocity dispersions .",
    "steve snowden kindly provided us with the latest version of his cast_hri package which we found very useful in the analysis of the data from our hri observation .",
