    "the trends uncovered in these local surveys are influenced by a wide range of physical effects , such as star formation , supernova and agn feedback , the cooling of gas and galaxy mergers , and hence provide as strict a test of galaxy formation models as that posed by the high redshift data .    in order to test current ideas about galaxy formation against observations ,",
    "well developed theoretical tools are needed which can follow many complex processes concurrently .",
    "most importantly , it is vital that the model predictions are produced in a form which can be compared as directly as possible with observations .",

    "physical processes are described using rules , some of which contain parameters whose values are set by comparing the model predictions with selected observations . as the range of data the model is compared against increases , the parameter space open to the models reduces .",
    "for example , the strength of supernova feedback ( see section 2 ) has an impact not only on the number of galaxies in the faint end of the luminosity function , but also on the size of galactic disks and even the morphological mix of galaxies",
    ".    two key properties of semi - analytical models are their computational speed and modular nature .",
    "the impact of different processes on the nature of the galaxy population can be rapidly assessed by running models with different parameter choices .",

    "any discrepancy uncovered between the model predictions and observations can help to identify physical ingredients which may either require better modelling or which may be missing altogether from the calculation .",
    "one clear example of how observations drive the development of the models is given by the recent efforts to reproduce the location and sharpness of the break in the galaxy luminosity function . with the current best fitting cosmological parameters , galaxy formation models struggled to avoid producing too many bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "one solution to this problem was suggested by observations showing the apparent absence of cooling flows at the centres of rich clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) which motivated the idea of taking into account the energy released by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this acts as a feedback process that heats the gas in massive haloes .",
    "the incorporation of this feedback mechanism suppresses the formation of galaxies in massive haloes , such that the right number of bright galaxies can be produced , and , furthermore , these galaxies have red colours to match those observed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we test two published galaxy formation models run using the galform semi - analytical model against statistics measured from the sloan digital sky survey . the @xcite model ( hereafter baugh2005 )",
    "invokes a `` superwind '' channel for supernova feedback , which ejects gas from low and intermediate mass haloes .",
    "this model assumes that stars are produced with a normal initial mass function ( imf ) in quiescent disks but with a top - heavy imf during merger - driven starbursts .",
    "the baugh2005 model is able to reproduce the counts and redshift distribution of sub - millimetre selected galaxies , along with the abundance of lyman - break galaxies and lyman-@xmath0 emitters @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model ( hereafter referred to as bower2006 ) incorporates agn feedback , with the energy released by the accretion of mass onto the central supermassive black hole in halos with quasistatic hot gas atmospheres being responsible for stifling the cooling rate .",

    "we first give a comparison of the main features of the baugh2005 and bower2006 models , introducing the recipes used to model phenomena which are varied in section 4 .",
    "similar discussions of these models can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the second part of this section we review the model used to compute galaxy sizes , which was originally devised by @xcite and tested by these authors for galactic disks and by @xcite for spheroids .",
    "the baugh2005 and bower2006 models represent alternative models of galaxy formation .",
    "the parameters which specify the models were set by the requirement that their predictions should reproduce a subset of the available observations of local galaxies together with certain observations of high redshift galaxies .",
    "different solutions were found due to the use of different physical ingredients , as set out below , and because different emphasis was placed on reproducing particular observations .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers for a full description of each model ; the baugh2005 model is also described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we now summarize the main differences between the two models .",
    "* _ cosmology . _",
    "the baugh2005 model adopts a @xmath3cdm cosmology with a present - day matter density parameter , @xmath4=0.3 , a cosmological constant , @xmath5=0.7 , a baryon density , @xmath6 and a power spectrum normalization given by @xmath7 .",
    "the bower2006 model uses the cosmological model assumed in the millennium simulation ( @xcite ) , where @xmath4=0.25 , @xmath5=0.75 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are in somewhat better agreement with the constraints from the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering on large scales ( e.g. @xcite ) . * _ halo merger trees . _",
    "the baugh2005 model uses a monte - carlo technique to generate merger histories for dark matter haloes , which is based on the extended press - schechter theory @xcite .",
    "the formation and evolution of a representative sample of dark matter haloes is followed . in the bower2006 model ,",
    "the merger histories are extracted from the millennium simulation ( see @xcite for a description of the trees ) .",
    "the mass resolution of the simulation trees is @xmath10 , which is a factor of three worse than that used in the monte - carlo trees . by comparing the output of models using monte - carlo and n - body merger trees",
    ", @xcite found very similar predictions for bright galaxies , with differences only becoming apparent below some faint magnitude , the value of which depends on the mass resolution of the n - body trees .",
    "the resolution of the millennium simulation yields a robust prediction for the luminosity function to around three magnitudes fainter than @xmath11 , which is more than adequate for the comparisons presented in this paper . *",
    "_ quiescent star formation timescale . _ the quiescent star formation rate in disks , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of cold gas and the time - scale , @xmath15 , is parameterized differently in the two models .",
    "in both cases , the star formation timescale is allowed to depend upon some power of the circular velocity of the disk and is multiplied by an efficiency factor . in the baugh2005 model , the efficiency factor is assumed to be independent of redshift , whereas in the case of the bower2006 model , this factor scales with the dynamical time of the galaxy * [ @xmath16 * , measured at the half - mass radius of the disk . since the typical dynamical time gets shorter with increasing redshift , the star formation timescale in the bower2006 model is shorter at high redshift than it would be in the equivalent disk in the baugh2005 model .",
    "this has implications for the amount of star formation in merger - triggered starbursts ( or following a disk becoming dynamically unstable in the bower2006 model - see later ) . in the bower2006 model , disks at",
    "high redshift tend to be gas poor , with the gas being turned into stars on a short timescale after cooling , whereas in the baugh2005 model , high redshift disks are gas rich . * _ initial mass function ( imf ) for star formation . _ the bower2006 model uses the @xcite imf , consistent with deductions from the solar neighbourhood , in all modes of star formation .",
    "the baugh2005 model also adopts this imf in quiescent star formation in galactic disks .",
    "however , in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers , a top - heavy imf is assumed .",
    "the yield of metals and the fraction of gas recycled per unit mass of stars formed are chosen to be consistent with the form of the imf . * _ supernova ( sn ) feedback . _ with each episode of star formation , a mass of cold gas is reheated and ejected from the disk by supernova explosions at a rate given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity at the disk half - mass radius , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parameters . the sn feedback is stronger in the bower2006 model ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 compared with @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the baugh2005 model ) . * _ agn vs superwind feedback . _",
    "perhaps the most significant difference between models is the manner in which the formation of very massive galaxies is suppressed . in the baugh2005 model , an additional channel or fate for gas heated by supernovae",
    "is invoked , called superwind feedback .",
    "in addition to the standard sne feedback model described in the previous bullet point , some gas is assumed to be expelled completely from the halo due to heating by supernovae .",
    "the amount of mass ejected is taken to be a multiple of the star formation rate , multiplied by a function of the circular velocity of the halo .",
    "the superwind is most effective in removing gas from low circular velocity haloes , with the mass of gas ejected falling with increasing circular velocity .",
    "the gas expelled in the superwind is not allowed to recool , even in more massive haloes at later times in the merger history .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the cooling rate in massive haloes since these haloes have less than the universal fraction of baryons .",
    "such winds have been observed in massive galaxies , with the inferred mass ejection rates found to be comparable to the star formation rate ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the bower2006 model an agn feedback model",
    "is implemented which regulates the cooling rate , effectively switching off the supply of cold gas for star formation in quasi - static hot gas haloes .",
    "these are haloes in which the cooling time of the gas exceeds the free - fall time within the halo .",
    "the cooling flow is quenched by the energy injected into the hot halo by the central agn .",
    "the growth of the black hole is followed using the model described by @xcite * _ disk instabilities . _ in the baugh2005 model the only process that leads to the formation of bulge stars is a galaxy merger . in the bower2006 model ,",
    "strongly self - gravitating disks are considered to be unstable to small perturbations , such as encounters with minor satellites or dark matter substructures .",
    "such events can lead to the formation of a bar and eventually the disk is transformed into a bulge .",
    "the onset of instability is governed by the ratio @xmath25 disks for which @xmath26 , are considered to be unstable ; in bower2006 , the threshold for unstable disks is set at @xmath27 .",
    "any cold gas present when the disk becomes unstable is assumed to participate in a starburst .",
    "as with starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers , a small fraction of the gas involved in the burst is accreted onto the central black hole .",
    "this is an important channel for the growth of low and intermediate mass black holes in the bower2006 model . *",
    "_ treatment of reheated cold gas .",
    "_ the fate of gas reheated by supernovae is different in the two models . in the baugh2005 model ,",
    "as discussed above , there are two possible fates for the gas heated by supernovae : ejection from the disk to be reincorporated into the hot halo and ejection from the halo altogether , with no possibility of recooling at a later time . in the case of the first of these channels",
    ", the gas is added back into the hot halo when a new halo forms .",
    "this happens when the original halo has doubled in mass since its formation time . in the bower2006 model , this timescale",
    "is instead taken to be some multiple of the dynamical time of the halo .",
    "thus , gas can be reheated by supernovae , be added back into hot halo and cool again on a shorter timescale in the bower2006 model than in the baugh2005 model .",
    "for completeness , we now review the calculation of the sizes of the disk and bulge components of galaxies used in galform , to complement the discussion of the size predictions presented in section 4 . for a more detailed description we direct the reader to cole et  al ( 2000 ) . in the following subsections ,",
    "we outline how the scale - lengths of the disk and bulge are calculated .",
    "the scale - lengths are determined by solving for the dynamical equilibrium of the disk , bulge and dark matter together .",
    "dark matter haloes are assumed to have a @xcite density profile .",
    "the hot halo has a modified isothermal density profile with a core .",
    "the size of a galactic disk is determined by the conservation of the angular momentum of the gas cooling from the halo and the application of centrifugal equilibrium .",
    "the disk is assumed to have an exponential surface density profile with half - mass radius @xmath28 .",
    "the half - mass radius of the disk is related to the exponential scale - length , @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the angular momentum of the dark matter halo is quantified by a dimensionless spin parameter which is drawn from a log - normal distribution , as suggested by measurements from high resolution n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "this scheme is used in both models ; the spin parameter of low - mass haloes can not be measured reliably from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "each newly formed halo in a halo merger tree is assigned a new spin parameter drawn from the distribution at random , independently of the previous value of the spin parameter .",
    "as the halo collapses , the associated gas will shock and so be heated to approximately the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "thereafter it will begin to cool via atomic processes .",
    "as gas cools it loses pressure support and flows to the center of the halo , where it is assumed to settle into a rotationally supported disk .",
    "the model assumes that the specific angular momentum of the cooling gas depends on the radius from which it originated , as described in @xcite .",
    "the scale - length of the disk is dependent on the angular momentum of the halo gas which cools .",
    "spheroids result from galaxy mergers , and in the case of the bower2006 model also from dynamical instabilities of disks .",
    "the size of the spheroid produced by these events is calculated by considering virial equilibrium and energy conservation .",
    "we assume that the projected density profile is well described by a de vaucouleurs @xmath31 law ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the effective radius , @xmath32 , of the @xmath31 law , i.e. the radius that contains half the mass in projection , is related to the half - mass radius in three dimensions , @xmath33 , by @xmath34 .",
    "when dark matter haloes merge , the galaxy in the most massive halo is assumed to become the central galaxy in the new halo while the other galaxies become satellites .",
    "the orbits of the satellites gradually decay as energy and angular momentum are lost via dynamical friction .",
    "eventually a satellite will merge with the central galaxy if the timescale for the orbit to decay is shorter than the halo lifetime .",
    "two types of merger are distinguished , major mergers and minor mergers , according to the ratio of the mass of the smaller galaxy to the larger galaxy @xmath35 . if the ratio is @xmath36 , then a major merger is assumed to have taken place .",
    "both stellar disks are transformed into spheroid stars and added to any pre - existing bulge .",
    "any cold gas present takes part in a starburst .",
    "if the ratio is @xmath37 then a minor merger is assumed and the stars of the smaller galaxy are added to the bulge of the central galaxy , which keeps its stellar disk . if @xmath38 and the central galaxy is gas rich , then the minor merger may also be accompanied by a burst .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 in both models ; @xmath40 in baugh2005 and @xmath41 in bower2006 .",
    "disks are considered gas rich if 10% of the total disk mass in stars and cold gas is in the form of cold gas in bower2006 ; this threshold is set higher , 75% , in baugh2005 .    in a merger ,",
    "the two galaxies are assumed to spiral together until their separation equals the sum of their half - mass radii , which is the moment when they are considered to have merged .",
    "we estimate the radius of the merger remnant using energy conservation . assuming virial equilibrium , the total internal energy @xmath42 of each galaxy ( both for the merging components and the remnant of the merger ) is related to its gravitational self - binding energy @xmath43 by @xmath44 , and so can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the mass and half - mass radius respectively and @xmath48 is a form factor which depends on the distribution of mass in the galaxy . for a de vaucouleurs profile , @xmath49 , while for an exponential disk , @xmath50 . for simplicity , in the model",
    "we assume @xmath51 for all galaxies .",
    "the orbital energy of a pair of galaxies at the moment of merging is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the masses of the merging galaxies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are their half - mass radii , and @xmath57 is a parameter which depends on the orbital parameters of the galaxy pair .",
    "a fiducial value of @xmath58 is adopted which corresponds to two point mass galaxies in a circular orbit with separation @xmath59 .",
    "the galaxy masses @xmath53 and @xmath54 include the total stellar and cold gas masses and also some part of the dark matter halo .",
    "we assume that the mass of dark matter which participates in the galaxy merger in this way is a multiple @xmath60 of dark halo mass @xmath61 within the galaxy half - mass radius .",
    "we adopt a fiducial value @xmath62 .",
    "we thus have : @xmath63 later on we will investigate the effect of varying @xmath57 and the dark matter mass contribution @xmath60 .",

    "the considerations that lead to the remnant size are similar to those applied to a bulge produced by mergers , leading to : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 refer to the masses and half - mass radii of the bulge ( if any ) and disk respectively . as mentioned above , the form factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 for a bulge and disk respectively .",

    "the latter two quantities are used as proxies for morphological type in analyses of sdss data .",
    "we also illustrate how the petrosian magnitude , concentration index and srsic index depend on the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio and on the ratio of the disk and bulge radii .      as a measure of galaxy flux , the sdss team uses a modified definition of the petrosian ( 1976 ) magnitude .",

    "we run the models using values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the latter of which corresponds to the case of a galaxy without participating dark matter .",

    "the effect is particularly important at bright magnitudes .",

    "we do not find , either , a variation in the luminosity function , but there is an increase in the fraction of early type galaxies , particularly at intermediate magnitudes . we can see that we can improve the sizes of early type galaxies , matching with those inferred from sdss observations for galaxies with magnitudes fainter than @xmath184 .",
    "however , this change is counterproductive at bright magnitudes , resulting in even smaller sizes .",
    "we have seen that the prediction of the bower2006 model for the size - luminosity relation of disk - dominated galaxies is much flatter than that of the baugh2005 model ( fig .",

    "we investigate the effect of varying several parameters together , essentially moving from the bower2006 parameters for sne feedback and the star formation timescale in disks , towards a set which more closely resembles that used in the baugh2005 model .",

    "one parameter is varied relative to the previous step , as shown in the key in fig .",

    "the first change made is to the value of @xmath20 , which controls the slope of the sne feedback .",
    "changing from the bower2006 value of @xmath185 to @xmath186 gives a much improved match to the observed size - luminosity relation , particularly for intermediate luminosities .",
    "faint disk - dominated galaxies are still somewhat too large , and bright galaxies in general are still too small .",
    "the next step is to retain the above change to @xmath20 , and also to change the value of @xmath19 to that used in baugh2005 .",
    "this results in a modest improvement in the size - luminosity relation for faint galaxies .",
    "finally , the scaling of the quiescent star formation timescale with the disk dynamical time is switched off .",
    "the resulting size - luminosity relation is now in very good agreement with the observations for disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "however , bright bulge - dominated galaxies are still too small .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity function and the predicted fraction of early types with luminosity are now much poorer matches to observations than in the fiducial bower2006 model ( lower two panels of fig .  [ flattosteep ] ) .        in summary ,",
    "even though the sizes of disk - dominated galaxies can be brought into reasonable agreement with observations in a variant of the bower2006 model with modified sne feedback and disk star formation timescale , this is at the expense of agreement with the observed luminosity function and early - type fraction .",
    "furthermore , neither the fiducial baugh2005 model nor the fiducial or modified bower2006 models are able to reproduce the observed sizes of early - type galaxies , in particular for bright galaxies .",
    "no single parameter change seemed able to solve the latter problem .",
    "the most promising area to explore further appears to be the modelling of galaxy mergers ; changing the amount of orbital energy brought in by merging galaxies in our prescription led to an increase in the sizes of the brightest bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "observations of local galaxies have always played a central role in setting the parameters of galaxy formation models . however , the huge size of the sdss sample combined with the quality and uniformity of the data allow much more precise and exacting tests of the physics of such models than was previously possible . to take full advantage of this opportunity ,",
    "it is necessary for the model to be able to generate predictions which are as close as possible to the measurements made for real galaxies . in this paper",
    "we use the galform model , which predicts the size of both the disk and bulge components of galaxies .",
    "hence we are able to take the model output for the luminosity and scale - lengths of a galaxy s disk and bulge and turn these into predictions for the quantities measured for sdss galaxies : the petrosian magnitude , the radius containing 50% of the petrosian flux ( @xmath88 ) , the concentration parameter ( @xmath130 ) and the srsic index ( @xmath97 ) , the latter two quantities providing descriptions of the light profile of the galaxy .    the first major result of this work is to understand the correlation between different indicators of galaxy morphology .",
    "the concentration parameter , srsic index and bulge - to - total ( @xmath110 ) luminosity ratio have all been used to divide galaxies into morphological classes ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath110 ratio is easy to compute theoretically , yet is perhaps the hardest of these quantities to measure observationally .",
    "both the @xmath130-@xmath110 and @xmath97-@xmath110 planes show scatter .",
    "this can be traced to the ratio of the disk and bulge scale - lengths ; galaxies with different values of this ratio occupy different loci in the @xmath130-@xmath110 and @xmath97-@xmath110 planes .",
    "the scatter is particularly large in the case of the srsic index @xmath97 versus @xmath110",
    ". the scatter would be even larger if we simply generated galaxies by hand , taking the ratio of disk and bulge scale - lengths from a grid .",
    "the scatter we find is limited by the distribution of @xmath111 values predicted by galform .",
    "we compared the predictions of two different versions of the galform model with sdss data : that of @xcite , which has a top - heavy imf in starbursts and feedback from superwinds , and @xcite , which has agn feedback and a normal imf in all modes of star formation . in the first stage of the comparison",
    ", none of the model parameters were adjusted to improve the fit to the data .",
    "the models gave reasonable matches to the total galaxy luminosity function , with the @xcite model giving the best overall match to the shape .",
    "the match to the luminosity function of different colour subsamples is less impressive ; both models overpredict the number of bright blue galaxies and fail to match the number of red galaxies .",
    "the @xcite model has a strongly bimodal colour distribution , whereas the @xcite model shows only weak bimodality .",
    "the @xcite model agrees better overall with the observed colours in sdss , although the predicted bimodality appears somewhat too strong , and the positions of the peaks in the colour distribution do not agree exactly with what is observed .",
    "another clear success of the models is in predicting the correct trend of morphological type with galaxy luminosity .",
    "we used all three morphological indicators ( concentration parameter , srsic index and bulge - to - total luminosity ratio from disk+bulge fits ) to separate galaxies into disk - dominated and bulge - dominated types . in the sdss data , the fractions of these types",
    "are found to shift from being almost completely disk - dominated at low luminosity to almost entirely bulge - dominated at high luminosity , though with differences in the detailed behaviour depending on which morphological indicator is used .",
    "both the @xcite and @xcite models successfully reproduce this general trend , although the @xcite model agrees better in detail with the observed behaviour at intermediate luminosities .",
    "both models qualitatively reproduce the observed correlation of colour with morphology ( with bulge - dominated galaxies on average being redder than disk - dominated galaxies at every luminosity ) , although quantitatively the @xcite model agrees better with the sdss data , the @xcite model predicting too many red disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most serious shortcoming of the models is in the predicted galaxy sizes . whilst the @xcite model gives a very good match to the luminosity - size relation for disks",
    ", the sizes of bulge - dominated galaxies do not match the observations .",
    "the slope of the size - luminosity relation for bulge - dominated galaxies in the baugh et  al .",
    "model matches the observations for faint galaxies , but the normalization is too high .",
    "brighter than @xmath125 , the predicted relation flattens , with the consequence that the brightest bulge - dominated galaxies are around a factor of three too small ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is worse for the sizes predicted by the @xcite model ; in this case the size - luminosity relation is flat for disk - dominated galaxies , while for bulge - dominated galaxies the predicted sizes at high luminosities fall even further below the observed relation than for the @xcite model .",
    "we have demonstrated that a steeper slope for the size - luminosity relation for disk - dominated galaxies can be recovered in the @xcite model if we set some physical processes to have the same parameters as used in the @xcite model .",
    "the primary improvement in the model predictions is seen on reducing the strength of sne feedback .",
    "also , by adjusting the star formation timescale in disks by switching off the dependence on the disk dynamical time , we can recover the observed slope of the size - luminosity relation even at high luminosities .",
    "however , this improvement in the size - luminosity relation comes at the expense of producing too many galaxies overall .",
    "the differences between the predictions of the two models for the sizes of disk - dominated galaxies lie in the revised cooling model adopted by @xcite , the strength of supernova feedback , the inclusion of agn feedback and the inclusion of dynamical instabilities for disks . in the @xcite model , gas which is reheated by supernova feedback is reincorporated into the hot halo on a shorter timescale than in the @xcite model .",
    "neither model is able to match the observed size of bright bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "we explore a range of processes in the models , varying the strength of supernova feedback , changing the threshold for disks to become unstable , and changing the prescription for computing the size of the stellar spheroid formed in a galaxy merger .",
    "the latter seems the most promising solution , at least in the case of the @xcite model .",
    "if we neglect the orbital energy of the galaxies which are about to merge ( i.e. setting the parameter @xmath187 ) , then the sizes of bright galaxies are in much better agreement with the observed sizes ( though the faint bulge - dominated galaxies are still too large ) . a similar change in the predictions results from ignoring the adiabatic contraction of the dark matter halo in response to the gravity of the disk and bulge @xcite .",
    "the galform model is one of the few able to make the range of predictions considered in this paper and hence to take full advantage of the constraining power of the sdss .",
    "the model for disk sizes works well under certain conditions , albeit with too much scatter .",
    "our analysis suggests that the problems with disk sizes and colours are connected to the treatment of gas cooling and supernova feedback , while the problems with spheroid sizes are probably due to an overly - simplified treatment of the sizes of galaxy merger remnants .",
    "the prescription used to compute the size of spheroids is in need of improvement , which will require the results of numerical simulations of galaxy mergers .",
    "this study highlights the need to make careful and detailed comparisons with observational data in order guide improvements in the treatment of physical processes in galaxy formation models .",
