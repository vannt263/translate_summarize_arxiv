    "in recent years , there is quite a bit activity on searching dibaryons both theoretically and experimentally . because it is commonly believed that the radius of the dibaryon is less than @xmath8 , studying dibaryon would enhance our knowledge about the short - range behavior of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , provide the information about the nonperturbative qcd ( npqcd ) and its appropriate treatment .",
    "moreover , the existence of dibaryon is a direct evidence of quarks in hadrons and hadronic systems .",
    "since jaffe predicted h @xcite , there have been lots of efforts devoted to the dibaryon study .",
    "the most intensive studied dibaryons are h , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . up to now",
    ", the most believed value of h is around the @xmath11 theshold @xcite , which agrees with the experimental finding , the lower limit of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction for @xmath13 varies model by model , but most believed value is several tens of mev @xcite .",
    "the theoretical result of @xmath10 is still away from the expected value extracted from double - charge - exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to propose studies on the systems with multi - strangeness . with this idea , @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 were studied @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we would demonstrate a systematic study of the possible @xmath0wave dibaryons .",
    "because npqcd still can not directly be solved , one has to use model to approximately treat the npqcd effect . in order to reliably study dibaryon ,",
    "the employed model should at least satisfy two - fold requirements : ( 1 ) the ground state properties of baryons , and the available experimental data of the nucleon - nucleon and the nucleon - hyperon ( @xmath16 ) scattering can reasonably be reproduced in the dynamical calculation . ( 2 ) in the extended application , no additional parameters are required .",
    "the su(3 ) chiral quark model is just one of the models which meets the requirements @xcite .",
    "the details of the model can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the model parameters are fixed before the calculation @xcite .",
    "the set of values used in ref.@xciteis called model i ( set i ) . in order to further reduce the number of free parameters , we choose the masses of strange scalar mesons , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , to be the values of the mesons with the same quantum numbers in the particle data table .",
    "moreover , in order to test the effects of various chiral fields , we also establish the extended su(2)chiral quark model ( model ii ) , where @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are disregarded , and the su(2 ) chiral quark model ( model iii ) , where only @xmath20 and @xmath21 are presented .",
    "the bound state problem of the six - quark system is solved by using the resonating group method ( rgm ) . in rgm",
    ", the trial wave function of the system can be written as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 describes the trial wave function of of relative motion between baryon clusters @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the antisymmetrizer . in terms of the variational method , one can solve @xmath23 and consequently the binding energy of the system .",
    "as is well known , the matrix element @xmath27 , where the superscript @xmath28 implies that @xmath26 acts in the @xmath29 space only , is an important measure of the action of the pauli principle on the two - baryon state .",
    "it also specifies the symmetry character of the system .",
    "the symmetry character of the two - baryon system could generally be divided into three categoyies . in the first category ,",
    "@xmath30 . this feature would be enormously beneficial to form a state with the @xmath31_{orbit}$ ] symmetry . if the inter - baryon interaction further demonstrates the attractive character with certain strength , it is possible to form a smaller - sized bound state . in the second category , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the pauli blocking effect here are very small so that two baryons are basically independent with each other .",
    "then , if the inter - baryon meson - exchange interaction can provide large enough attraction , the system would be bound .",
    "this result may also be deduced in terms of a model in the baryon - meson degrees of freedom .",
    "the states with @xmath33 belong to the third category .",
    "the pauli blocking effect between baryons are incredibly serious so that the state with @xmath31_{orbit}$ ] is almost a forbidden state , namely , it is very hard to form a bound state .",
    "we present the calculated binding energies and the corresponding root - mean - square radii ( @xmath34 ) for the possible @xmath0wave states in the first and second categories in tables 1@xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    ", one finds that in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 cases , the systems in model i are bounder than in models ii and iii , because the strong attraction provided by @xmath21 and strange mesons @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if one believes that the su(3 ) model is more suitable for the multi - strangeness system , @xmath1_{(0,0)}$ ] and @xmath2_{(0,1/2)}$ ] should be deeply bound states with narrow widths .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 systems , models i and ii are favored by the low - spin and high - spin systems , respectively . because the color - magnetic interaction ( cmi ) shows repulsive and attractive features in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 systems , respectively , the binding energies of the @xmath58 systems are generally higher than those of the @xmath56 systems . moreover , due to the strong decay modes of both composed baryons , the widths of these bound states are broad .",
    "the results in table 1@xmath36 shows another type of character . because , like @xmath59 , the exchange effect is almost negligible , the resultant binding energy is very sensitive to the contributions from chiral fields .",
    "it is shown that the high - strangeness system is bounder in model i and the low - strangeness system has larger binding energy in model iii .",
    "nevertheless , these systems are weakly bound .    finally , to ensure the predicted bound states are reliable and stable",
    ", we also examine their model - parameter dependencies .",
    "the @xmath60- and @xmath61-dependencies are demonstrated in table 1 by sets i and ii .",
    "it is shown that the qualitative binding behavior does not change although the binding of most systems become slightly weaker due to the overall weaker attractive feature from @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath62- and @xmath63-dependencies are plotted in fig .",

    "it is shown that the binding energy always becomes smaller with increasing @xmath63 and decreasing @xmath62 , but the qualitative binding behavior does not change .",

    "we investigate the possible @xmath0wave baryon - baryon bound states with the su(3 ) chiral quark model , and test the reliabilities and stabilities of results by using different models and model parameters .",
    "it is shown that the symmetry property , characterized by the expectation value of antisymmetrizer , of the system is a major factor to affect the binding behavior .",
    "sometimes , the contributions from various chiral fields demonstrate very important roles .",
    "we arrange all the bound states into three types .",
    "the first type states , such as @xmath1_{(0,0)}$ ] and @xmath2_{(0,1/2)}$ ] should be deeply bound states with narrow widths , or dibaryons.the states of second type , such as @xmath3_{(0,5/2)}$ ] , @xmath3_{(3,1/2)}$ ] , @xmath4_{(0,3)}$ ] and @xmath4_{(3,0)}~(d^{*})$ ] are bound states with broad widths .",
