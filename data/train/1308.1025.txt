    "in the non - relativistic schrdinger equation usually the mass is assumed to be independent of position . however , there are certain physical systems in which , according to the experimental data , the effective mass should be position dependent .",
    "apart from semiconductor theory , in which effective masses depending on the spatial coordinates have been used since many years @xcite , this is also the case in atomic nuclei , especially in the collective model of bohr @xcite .",
    "if the mass is position dependent , then it does not commute with the momentum .",
    "therefore there are many ways to generalize the usual form of the kinetic energy in order to obtain a hermitian operator . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most general non - relativistic schrdinger equation which possesses a position dependent mass and at the same time respects hermiticity was proposed .",
    "a further step was taken in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which a general scheme was proposed , through the introduction of a parameter @xmath2 in the kinetic energy term , which apart from hermiticity also ensures the exact solvability of the relevant non - relativistic schrdinger equation , in which the mass dependence on the position is reflected in the parameter @xmath2 .    in the realm of nuclear physics ,",
    "the need for three different mass coefficients in the low lying collective bands of well - deformed axially symmetric even - even nuclei has been demonstrated using the experimental data for spectra and @xmath1 transition rates by jolos and von brentano @xcite . in an extended version of this approach @xcite a mass tensor with deformation dependent components is introduced , the method being applicable to nuclei of arbitrary shape .",
    "this approach has been recently extended to odd nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been recently proved @xcite that by allowing the nuclear mass to depend on the deformation , the rate of increase of the moment of inertia with deformation is moderated , thus removing a main drawback @xcite of the bohr hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this has been achieved by using a davidson potential @xcite and taking advantage of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susyqm ) techniques @xcite developed in the study of quantum systems with mass depending on the coordinates @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the davidson potential @xcite , initially introduced for the description of molecular spectra , has been used for the description of nuclei since long ago @xcite .",
    "a major step forward has been the clarification of its group theoretical structure when used within the bohr hamiltonian , which was proved to be su(1,1)@xmath3so(5 ) @xcite .",
    "this breakthrough led to the development of the algebraic collective model , a very rapidly converging approach allowing the calculation of spectra and transition probabilities of nuclei of any shape @xcite .    in the present work we consider the deformation dependent mass ( ddm ) bohr hamiltonian with a kratzer potential @xcite .",
    "this potential , also used initially in molecular physics , has been first used for the description of nuclei by fortunato and vitturi @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by the following questions .",
    "\\(i ) it is known that in the susyqm framework @xcite the functional form of the dependence of the mass on the deformation is different for each potential .",
    "a first challenge is to prove that a ddm solution exists for the bohr hamiltonian with a kratzer potential , and to find the form of this functional dependence .",
    "\\(ii ) the shapes of the davidson @xcite and kratzer @xcite potentials , shown in fig .  1 , are similar for small values of @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 term dominates in both cases , but they differ substantially at large values of @xmath4 , where the tails of the wave functions behave as @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite respectively .",
    "it is interesting to examine to what extent numerical results for spectra and @xmath1 transition rates are influenced by the change in the potential .",
    "the level spacings within the @xmath8 band , which are usually overestimated by collective models based on the bohr hamiltonian , including the ddm davidson model , are of particular interest .",
    "\\(iii ) the ddm bohr hamiltonian with the davidson potential works well for deformed nuclei , but fails in describing the nuclei lying at the critical point between the spherical and deformed regions @xcite , known to be examples of the x(5 ) critical point symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to examine if the ddm bohr hamiltonian with the kratzer potential overcomes this drawback .    in section ii the ddm bohr hamiltonian is briefly reviewed , while in section iii the special case of the kratzer potential is considered .",
    "analytical expressions for spectra and wave functions are given in sections iv and v respectively , while the calculation of @xmath1 transition rates is described in section vi .",
    "numerical results for spectra and @xmath1 transition rates are given in section vii , while section viii contains the conclusions and plans for further work .",
    "the use of the deformed shape invariance principle for the construction of the spectrum is given in appendix 1 , while many technical details concerning the wave functions are given in appendices 2 - 6 . finally , in appendix 7 , scaling factors are discussed .",

    "allowing the mass to depend on the deformation coordinate @xmath4 ( which measures departure from spherical shape ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant and @xmath15 a function of @xmath4 only , the bohr equation becomes @xcite @xmath16 \\psi = \\epsilon \\psi , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where reduced energies @xmath17 and reduced potentials @xmath18 have been used , and @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are free parameters , stemming from the following cause .",
