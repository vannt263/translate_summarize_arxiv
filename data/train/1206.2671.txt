    "the demand for higher photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies has recently led to the emergence of a whole new generation of solar cell concepts based on multiple junctions @xcite , intermediate bands @xcite , multiple exciton generation @xcite or hot carrier effects @xcite .",
    "compared to the standard bulk technology , the corresponding devices are of highly increased structural and conceptual complexity , comparable to the advanced optoelectronic devices in the field of light emission , such as solid state lasers and light emitting diodes , and like these counterparts , they strongly rely on the design degrees of freedom offered by the utilization of semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "this instance is hardly surprising if one considers that photovoltaics ( `` photons in - electrons out '' ) can be regarded as the inverse regime of solid state lighting ( `` electrons in - photons out '' ) .",
    "however , even though the structures be the same , in switching to the photovoltaic operation , the focus is shifted from the optical to the electronic output characteristics , with the objective to achieve maximum carrier extraction rate at largest possible separation of contact fermi levels .    while there is still a relation between photovoltaic and light - emitting quantum efficiency through the optoelectronic reciprocity relation @xcite , real devices are",
    "usually non - radiatively limited , and efficient charge transport from the location of photogeneration to and fast extraction at the contacts becomes thus of pivotal importance .",
    "indeed , the semiconductor nanostructures not only have to provide tunable and localization enhanced optical transitions ( photogeneration ) , but their absorbing states need either be coupled to extended bulk - like states or among themselves in order to enable electronic current flow ( charge separation ) .",
    "the coupling can be provided via hybridization in situations where carriers can tunnel between localized and extended states , as in the case of ( multi ) quantum well diodes , or via inelastic scattering processes such as absorption and emission of phonons or low energy photons , respectively .",
    "the former mechanism is important both in devices relying on thermionic emission , such as multi - quantum - well solar cells @xcite , as well as in superlattice absorber devices in the sequential tunneling transport regime @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism is utilized in the intermediate band solar cell , where the carriers from the isolated intermediate absorber band are excited into the contacted continuum via an additional photon absorption process .",
    "apart from providing coupling mechanisms , non - radiative inelastic scattering mechanisms are also responsible for any non - radiative output power losses in the transport process , either via recombination of charge carriers or via energy dissipation due to charge carrier thermalization and relaxation . a substantial reduction of this energy dissipation forms the basis of the hot carrier solar cell concept , which on the other hand requires the use of energy selective contacts to extract the hot carriers .",
    "again , the application of semiconductor nanostructures is being considered , e.g. resonant tunneling through single quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a purely electronic use of nanostructures in solar cells , independent of the optical properties .",
    "another example would be the interband tunnel contact in multi - junction devices @xcite .",
    "the opposite situation of purely optical functionality concerns the vast field of light management in solar cells via photonic structures , which lies beyond the scope of this review .    as a result of the large number of implications that are linked to the use of nanostructures in photovoltaic devices",
    ", it is very hard to say whether a certain structure is going to be beneficial or detrimental to the device characteristics , even under the idealized conditions of the radiative limit , assuming defect - free interfaces etc . in many devices",
    ", there is for instance the intrinsic conflict mentioned above between maximum localization needed for ideal absorption and maximum delocalization required for ideal transport .",
    "indeed , at this stage , only a few of the high - efficiency concepts have been realized successfully , such as the iii - v semiconductor material based multi - junction devices and strain - balanced multi - quantum - well solar cells , the latter example demonstrating in an impressive way the feasibility of highly efficient nanostructure based devices with a large number of interfaces . in order to be able to asses the potentials and capabilities of the various novel photovoltaic concepts ,",
    "a realistic theoretical estimate of the specific device characteristics is thus highly desirable .",
    "the complexity of structure and physical mechanisms as well as the prominent role of dimensional and quantum effects characterizing the operation of these novel solar cell devices preclude the use of standard macroscopic bulk semiconductor transport theory conventionally used in photovoltaics , which is nothing else than the charge continuity equation for electrons and holes with a source term corresponding to the net interband generation rate and a drift - diffusion current with a longitudinal electric field obeying poisson s equation .",
    "on the other hand , rate equation type quantum optical approaches used for solid state lasers or light - emitting diodes often lack a satisfactory description of dissipative charge transport and extraction / injection at contacts , while suitable quantum transport formalisms were devised for unipolar devices and do thus normally not include the optical coupling . hence , for a comprehensive theoretical description of photovoltaic devices based on nanostructured absorbers and/or conductors , a theory is required that treats on equal footing both quantum optics and dissipative quantum transport .",
    "these requirements can only be satisfied on the level of quantum kinetics , such as provided by the wigner - function , density - matrix and non - equilibrium green s function formalisms .    among the quantum - kinetic theories ,",
    "the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method is the most versatile and powerful tool to study non - equilibrium properties of nanostructures , since it is based on a quantum field theoretical approach to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . in the negf approach ,",
    "the green s functions ( gfs ) for the involved ( quasi)particles ( electrons , holes , phonons , photons , excitons , plasmons , etc ) are the model functions providing the physical quantities that characterize the system .",
    "they correspond to the response of the system to external perturbations , the latter entering the equations of motion for the green s functions , the dyson s equations , in the form of self - energies .",
    "the self - energies due to ( weak ) interactions such as electron - phonon or electron - photon coupling are calculated using standard diagrammatic or operator expansion techniques used in many - body perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the coupling to the environment represented by contacts , i.e. the application of open boundary conditions , is provided by a special type of boundary self - energy .    due to the generality of the method steming form its sound foundations",
    ", the negf formalism has found application in the description of large number of different micro- and mesoscopic systems under non - equilibrium conditions , of which only a few can be mentioned here .",
    "apart from the application to actual non - equilibrium quantum transport phenomena comprising ballistic transport and resonant tunneling in semiconductor multilayers and nanostructures of different dimensionality ( quantum wells @xcite , wires @xcite and dots @xcite ) , metallic and molecular conduction @xcite , phonon mediated inelastic and thermal transport @xcite , coulomb - blockade @xcite and kondo - effect @xcite , it is also used to describe strongly non - equilibrium and interacting regimes in semiconductor quantum optics requiring a quantum kinetic approach @xcite , with phenomena such as non - equilibrium absorption , interband polarization , spontaneous emission and laser gain .",
    "the concept was first adapted to the simulation of transport in open nanoscale devices on the example of tunneling in metal - insulator - metal junctions @xcite , and has in the following been applied to investigation and modelling of mosfet@xcite , cnt - fet @xcite , resonant tunneling diodes @xcite and interband tunneling diodes @xcite , interband quantum well lasers @xcite and intraband quantum cascade lasers @xcite , as well as infrared photodetectors @xcite , cnt - photodiodes @xcite and quantum well leds @xcite .",
    "the theory was formulated both for continuum effective - mass @xcite an atomistic multiband tight - binding @xcite models of the electronic structure , and in the case of molecular conduction it is combined with ab - initio methods such as density functional theory @xcite .",
    "this review now provides an overview of the general framework for the theoretical description of quantum photovoltaic ( qpv ) devices based on the negf formalism , as first introduced in @xcite for the investigation of quantum well solar cells ( qwsc ) . after the specification of the type of system under consideration ,",
    "the non - equilibrium quantum statistical treatment of its different physical degrees of freedom ( charge carriers , photons , phonons ) is discussed , resulting in a general microscopic theory of photovoltaic devices .",
    "the unique kind of spectral information the theory is able to provide is then illustrated on the example of two prototypical qpv devices , a single quantum well photodiode and a silicon - oxide based superlattice absorber device .",
    "as in any device simulation , the ultimate goal of the present approach it to predict the response of a device to a given variation in the external conditions ( bias , temperature , illumination ,  ) and for given material properties ( electronic , phononic , photonic structure ) , via the solution of ( coupled ) dynamical equations for the degrees of freedom of the device affected by the perturbation . in a formalized picture ,",
    "the dynamical equations describe the evolution of the states of the system and their occupation for given initial solution and boundary conditions . before turning to the dynamical equations ,",

    "quantum chemical methods such as density - functional theory are required for the electronic - structure calculation .",
    "there is an important difference between light - emitting optoelectronic devices and solar cells to consider at this point : while both transport and emission take place in a narrow energetic range around the band edge , absorption of solar radiation is a broadband process .",
    "hence , in principle , a full - zone description of the electronic structure is required to cover the photogeneration induced by the entire solar spectrum .    apart from the range of energy states described , the largest impact of the choice of basis concerns the spatial resolution and flexibility therein . while effective continuum approaches such as ema or @xmath208 lend themselves to optimized adaptive spatial grids , allowing for coarse - grained treatment of spatially homogeneous regions such as bulk leads and high resolution close to heterointerface , the grid is fixed by the atomic lattice in the case of an atomistic basis , which precludes the description of extended systems , unless one resorts to multiscale approaches @xcite .    in some cases , a mode space basis may be preferred over a real space basis , i.e. in the case where only a few modes contribute to the device characteristics .",
    "this is for instance the case for the transverse modes in nanowire transport @xcite , or in periodic superstructures @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases , the mode spectrum in leads or contacts deviates strongly from the discrete mode spectrum of the low dimensional absorber , or , like e.g. in quantum well solar cells , there is a continuous transition from a discrete to a continuous mode spectrum in the energy range of interest .",
    "indeed , the ability to treat on equal footing bound state to bound state and bound state to continuum transitions represents a considerable advantage of real space approaches @xcite .      among the numerical issues arising and approximations imposed due to computational limitations ,",
    "the most prominent ones for the photovoltaic applications in mind are inadequate energy mesh discretization and the non - locality of the interactions .",
    "the former problem arises whenever resonances appear in the transmission function of a structure , either due to localization effects leading to the formation of quasibound states or due to van hove singularities in the density of states .",
    "the mesh should be refined around the resonances in order to avoid large errors in the energy integration and resulting convergence problems .",
    "different approaches have been developed to tackle the refinement issue , mainly adaptive algorithms @xcite or methods for the resolution of the poles of the gfs giving rise to the resonances @xcite . in the case where a large number of poles are present",
    ", adaptive refinement according to the resolution of the spectral output quantities is preferrable .",

    ", care has to be taken to use interpolation schemes that guarantee current conservation .",
    "the determination of the full gf provides information on propagation and correlations between any two sites of the dievice and thus includes all non - local phenomena .",
    "however , such a computation is very time and memory consuming , wherefore approximate schemes with a limited number of non - zero off - diagonal gf elements are used , which then allows for the application of fast computational routines such as the recursive gf algorithm @xcite but at the same time reducing the range of non - locality taken into account by the simulation . while the consequences are sizable even for rather localized intraband scattering mechanisms such as coupling to phonons @xcite , they are severe in the case of the interband scattering due to coupling to photons , since in the latter case , due to the comparably long wave length of the light , the non - locality is not restricted by the matrix element of the coupling itself , but by the density of states which couple @xcite .",
