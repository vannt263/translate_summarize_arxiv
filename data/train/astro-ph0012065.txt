    "the host galaxies of powerful radio sources have been identified with massive galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the close correlation in the hubble @xmath13 diagram suggests this is also true out to the highest redshifts ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by studying high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs )",
    ", we can thus observe some of the largest mass concentrations on galaxy scales in the early universe , and put constraints on galaxy formation theories .",
    "hzrgs are amongst the most luminous observable objects at very high redshift .",
    "although unification theories of radio galaxies and quasars ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that we can also use quasars for such studies , radio galaxies offer a much clearer picture of the host galaxy , because of the absence of appreciable contamination from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . in radio galaxies , the cone of bright emission originating from the agn",
    "is believed to be directed away from the observer . in this sideway viewing angle",
    ", the agn emission is presumed to be shielded by optically thick material .",
    "this `` natural coronograph '' allows the study of the stellar populations in some hzrgs ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and investigations of the morphology of forming massive galaxies unhindered by issues of dynamic range ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a major advantage of radio galaxies over the large population of lyman - break galaxies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ?",
    "* ) is that they are not selected on the basis of their optical properties , but on the basis of radio emission . in principle , a radio - selected survey with subsequent near - ir identifications can find galaxies out to @xmath14 ( optical spectroscopy ) or @xmath15 ( near - ir spectroscopy ) , un - restricted to specific pass - bands , which limit optical color selection techniques .",
    "such a continuous redshift range is important to select targets for follow - up observations that depend on atmospheric pass - bands in the near - ir or interference - free frequency ranges in the radio regime . for example , searches for associated  21 cm line absorption are often hampered by local interference @xcite , and are only possible in limited redshift ranges .",
    "the absence of any _ a priori _ optical color selection also allows the discovery of objects with anomalous uv / optical spectral energy distributions , and because the radio emission is insensitive to dust absorption , radio - selected samples can provide an unbiased view with respect to the dust properties at high redshift . for example , the importance of dust at high redshift was recently shown by sub - mm observations of a large sample of hzrgs @xcite , which suggest an increased detection rate at @xmath4 , even after @xmath16correction effects are taken into account .",
    "previous searches for hzrgs , using 3 - 4 m class telescopes have been difficult because the galaxies are faint ( @xmath17 ) , and fewer than 20 radio galaxies with @xmath4 have been reported in the literature . however , with the availability of modern 8 - 10 m class telescopes , it is now feasible to begin a systematic search for hzrgs at much fainter magnitudes than before .",
    "to start such a program , we constructed a sample of ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) radio sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "such sources have been used for two decades to find hzrgs .",
    "this technique mainly makes use of a `` radio @xmath16correction '' effect : at higher redshift , an increasingly steeper part of the generally concave radio spectrum shifts to the fixed observing frequencies of the large radio surveys .",
    "previous samples of uss sources have shown the efficiency of this technique in finding @xmath18 radio galaxies : half of the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) sources are at @xmath18 @xcite . in our uss sample , which is based on several deep , large radio surveys that have recently become available , we select sources with spectral indices @xmath0 in order to enlarge the sample of @xmath4 objects .",
    "our sample partially overlaps with the one of @xcite , who use a spectral index cutoff of @xmath21 , also based on the 365  mhz texas @xcite and 1.4  ghz nvss @xcite radio surveys , to study the distribution of extremely steep spectrum sources .",
    "their sample emphasizes the contribution of pulsars , whose median spectral index is @xmath22 @xcite , and could represent a significant fraction of the steepest spectrum radio sources . in our sample , we have excluded the galactic plane region ( @xmath23 ) in order to avoid large amounts of galactic extinction ; this should also reduce the number of pulsars in our sample .",
    "our observational campaign to find hzrgs from our sample of uss sources consists of three parts : ( i ) high resolution radio imaging ( paper  i ) to select sources with either compact or fr  ii @xcite morphologies , and determine radio positions accurate to within @xmath9 ; ( ii ) optical and near - ir imaging ( de  breuck et  al .",
    ", in preparation ; hereafter paper  ii ) to identify the host galaxies of the radio sources ; and ( iii ) optical spectroscopy , as described in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we present the spectroscopic sample and describe both the observations and data reduction .",
    "the results comprise  3 . in  4 , we discuss the redshift distribution of the uss sources , the small population of uss quasars , and speculate on the nature of the sources lacking redshift determination .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "we defer a statistical analysis of the emission line regions in hzrgs to a companion paper @xcite . throughout",
    ", we assume @xmath24  km  s@xmath25mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26=0.5 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we obtained the spectra presented in this paper between 1996 april and 2000 april . at the start of this spectroscopic campaign ,",
    "our main uss sample was not finalized , as the final versions of the wenss , texas , nvss and first radio source catalogs were not yet published ( see paper  i for a description of these catalogs and our final uss sample , consisting of 669 sources ) . during this period , we observed objects from two other uss samples , as well as six sources that were excluded from our well - defined ( @xmath0 ) uss sample when the revised flux densities in the radio survey catalogs were published .",
    "we refer to these sources using the prefix `` wnr '' and `` tnr '' , for sources removed from our wn and tn samples , respectively .",
    "we provide the final radio source parameters of these six objects in table [ rejwntn ] .",
    "the entries in this table are similar to those for the sources in paper  i. in the appendix , we show vla radio maps of three objects listed in table [ rejwntn ] .",
    "radio maps from the other three wnr objects can be obtained from the first survey @xcite .",

    "prior to 1998 december , we used the 300 @xmath64 mm@xmath25 grating blazed at 5000    combined with the 1  wide slit , which results in a resolution of @xmath75 10    ( fwhm ) , with a wavelength coverage from @xmath754100    to @xmath758800   . starting from our 1998 december run , we used the 150 @xmath64 mm@xmath25 grating blazed at 7500    combined with the 15 wide slit , which results in a resolution of @xmath75 15    ( fwhm ) and a wavelength coverage from @xmath754000    to @xmath7510,000   , but with poor s / n at the red end .",

    "for those objects with more than one exposure , we subtracted one of the bracketing exposures which was shifted by @xmath7810  along the slit , and subtracted the residual sky contribution which is due to the variation of the sky brightness . after registration using an integer pixel shift determined from other objects along our long slit , we summed both exposures , and extracted a one - dimensional spectrum . in all cases ,",

    "* ) ; the main use of our spectra is the redshift determination and relative line flux ratios between the individual emission lines . in most cases ,",
    "deeper spectra are needed to study the faint continuum flux .",
    "we extracted a calibration lamp spectrum using the same aperture as that for the object , and corrected the derived wavelength solution by applying a small additional offset determined from a comparison with the wavelength of several well - resolved skylines ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , we flux calibrated the spectra using standard star observations obtained during each observing night .",
    "we estimate our flux calibration is accurate to @xmath7520% , except for the objects which were observed in non - photometric conditions ( see table [ specjournal ] ) .",
    "we include the derived line fluxes of these sources nevertheless for line - ratio studies .",
    "we used the procedures described in @xcite to determine the central wavelength , total line flux , de - convolved widths , and rest - frame equivalent widths ( with their related errors ) of all the emission and absorption lines detected in our spectra . for each object",
    ", we quote a single redshift , which is an average of all the lines , weighed by the uncertainties due to the line fitting and wavelength calibration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we present the results for the sources in our main and subsidiary uss samples ( see  2.1 ) in table [ lineparameters ] , and show extracted one - dimensional spectra in figure [ spectra ] .    to determine the redshift and identify the emission and absorption lines , we compared our spectra with composite hzrg spectra @xcite .",

    "higher resolution and deeper radio data will be needed to clarify the radio - optical morphology , and if the companion object should be considered part of the main galaxy or not . in the @xmath65band image obtained with the eso  3.6 m telescope ( see paper  ii ) , we marginally detect the northern object , but do not detect the southern object down to @xmath225 , classifying this object as an ero with @xmath226 .",
    "we obtained an lris spectrum with the slit passing through the two near - ir objects , as indicated in figure [ tn0936kc ] .",
    "the spectrum of the fuzzy northern object ( fig .",

    "[ tn0936spec ] , middle panel ) shows a very red object , but no convincing emission lines . if we interpret the emission line in the northern object as [ oii ]  @xmath633727   , and assume the same @xmath7 for the southern object , the latter displays the 2640    and 2900    continuum breaks .",
    "we therefore assume both objects are components of the same source , or companion objects .",
    "the spectrum of the southern component closely resembles the old , red galaxies lbds  53w091 at @xmath227 ( * ? ? ?",

    "further evidence for an old age comes from the very red @xmath178 color .",
    "the identification of tn  j0936@xmath52201 with the southern @xmath235 component puts this object on the main trend in the hubble @xmath13 relation at @xmath7 .",
    "if the diffuse northern component is part of the same physical system , the total magnitude could even mount to @xmath236 in an 8  diameter aperture . because the radio luminosity of tn  j0936@xmath52201 is not particularly weak ( @xmath237  erg  s@xmath25  hz@xmath25 ) , and no strong contribution from agn emission is seen in the spectrum , this argues against a significant direct contribution from a non - stellar agn dominated component to the k - band magnitudes @xcite .",
