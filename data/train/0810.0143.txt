    "the study of the parsec scale properties of radio galaxies is crucial to obtain information on the nature of their central engine .    in order to study statistical properties of different classes of sources ,",
    "it is necessary to define and observe a sample that is free from selection effects . to this aim",
    ", it is important to define the sample using a low radio frequency , to avoid observational biases related to orientation effects , thanks to the dominance at low radio frequency of the unbeamed extended emission . with this purpose",
    ", we started a project to observe a complete sample of radio galaxies ( the bologna complete sample ( bcs ) ) selected within the b2 catalog of radio sources and the third cambridge revised catalog ( 3cr ) @xcite , with no selection constrain on the nuclear properties .",
    "the sample consists of 95 radio sources .",
    "we selected the sources above a homogeneous flux density limit of 0.25 jy at 408 mhz for the b2 sources and those above 10 jy at 178 mhz for the 3cr sources @xcite and applied the following criteria :    0.5truecm    \\1 ) declination @xmath110@xmath2    \\2 ) galactic latitude @xmath3 b @xmath3 @xmath1 15 @xmath2    \\3 ) redshift z@xmath00.1    0.5truecm    at present vlbi observations are available for 76 sources .",
    "the missing 19 sources will require very sensitive observations ( phase reference technique and large bandwidth ) because of the very low activity of the radio core .",
    "among sources with vlbi data , we have the following kiloparsec - scale structure :    * 50 fr i radio galaxies ; * 13 fr ii radio galaxies ; * 8 compact sources with a flat spectrum ; * 2 bl lac objects ; * 1 compact symmetric object ( cso ) ; * 1 compact steep - spectrum source ( css ) .",
    "moreover , 1 source is identified with a peculiar spiral galaxy and was not included in the present discussion .",
    "the observed sample is representative of a sample of sources oriented at random angles with respect to the line of sight .",
    "in fact , in a randomly oriented sample of radio galaxies , the probability that a source is at an angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 with respect to the line of sight is p(@xmath4,@xmath5 ) = cos@xmath4 @xmath6 cos@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the percentage of fr i plus fr ii radio sources is @xmath7 @xmath8 , corresponding to sources oriented at angles greater than @xmath7 35@xmath2 ",
    "40@xmath2 , in agreement with unified models .    at parsec scale",
    "most of the sources ( 24 fr i and 7 fr ii ) show as expected a one - sided jet structure because of relativistic effects , however we have also a high number of sources with a symmetric jet structure .",
    "we note , however , that the detection of a counterjet may be related to the sensitivity of the map , whereas the dynamic range is not a problem in our images , as the sources are generally weak .",
    "we classify as two sided all sources showing both a jet and counterjet , regardless of the value of the jet to the counterjet ratio or the length of the counterjet .",
    "the total number of sources with a two - sided morphology is 17 , corresponding to @xmath7 25@xmath9 .",
    "this percentage is significantly higher than that found in previous samples in the literature : there are 11@xmath9 symmetric sources in the pr ( pearson - readhead ) sample @xcite and 4.6@xmath9 ( 19/411 ) in the combined pr and caltech - jodrell ( cj ) samples @xcite .    for two - sided sources ,",
    "the brightness ratio between the two jets is in the range 15 , while most of the brightness lower limit in one - sided sources is higher than 5 confirming that the sensitivity in our maps is generally good enough to detect two sided sources .    the main difference between the percentage of symmetric sources in the present sample and in previous samples is naturally explained in the framework of unified scheme models since our sources have been selected at low frequency and should not be affected by an orientation bias .    the comparison between the vla and vlba jet position angles ( p.a . ) shows that most of the sources do not show a large misalignment and that the one - sided parsec scale ( or the brigther jet in double - sided parsec jets ) is oriented with respect to the nuclear emission , on the same side of the brighter kiloparsec - scale .",
    "we compared the total flux at vlba scale with the core arcsecond flux density .",
    "we find that 70 @xmath9 have a correlated flux density larger than 70@xmath9 of the arcsecond core flux density .",
    "this means that in these sources we mapped most of the milliarcsecond ( mas ) scale structure and so we can properly connect the parsec to the kiloparsec structures .    for 19 ( 30@xmath9 ) sources ,",
    "a significant fraction of the arcsecond core flux density is missing in the vlba images .",
    "this suggest variability or the presence of significant structures between @xmath730 mas and 2 arcsec that the vlba can miss because the lack of short baselines . to properly study these structures , future observations with evla or the e - merlin array",
    "will be necessary .",
