    "thanks to the successful running of the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) , particle physics has entered a new era , which is featured by the discovery of a new boson with a mass close to @xmath1  gev  @xcite .",
    "its measured properties are so far in good agreement with those of the standard model  ( sm ) higgs  @xcite , suggesting that the electro - weak symmetry breaking  ( ewsb ) is probably realized via the higgs mechanism implemented through a single scalar doublet .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the ewsb is not necessarily induced by just a single scalar .",
    "interestingly , many new physics  ( np ) scenarios are equipped with an extended scalar sector .",
    "the search for additional scalars is one of the important programs of the lhc experiments .",
    "one of the extensions of sm scalar sector is the so - called two - higgs - doublet model  ( 2hdm )  @xcite , in which a second scalar doublet is added to the sm field content . to avoid the experimental constraints on flavor - changing neutral - current  ( fcnc ) transitions , which are forbidden at tree level in the sm due to the gim mechanism  @xcite , two different hypotheses , natural flavor conservation  ( nfc )  @xcite and minimal flavor violation  ( mfv )  @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed  . in the nfc hypothesis ,",
    "depending on the @xmath2 charge assignments on the scalar doublets and fermions , there exist four types of 2hdm  ( type - i , ii , x and y )  @xcite . in the mfv hypothesis , to control the flavor - violating interactions , all the scalar yukawa couplings are assumed to be composed of the sm ones @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the  higgs basis \"  @xcite , in which only one doublet gets a nonzero vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) and behaves as the sm one , the allowed @xmath5 representation of the second scalar doublet that couples to quarks via yukawa interactions is fixed to be either @xmath6 or @xmath7  @xcite , which implies that the second scalar doublet can be either color - singlet or color - octet . for convenience ,",
    "they are referred to as type - iii and type - c models  @xcite , respectively . examples of the former include the aligned 2hdm  ( a2hdm )  @xcite and the four types of 2hdm reviewed in ref .",
    "the scalar spectrum of the latter contains , besides a cp - even and color - singlet higgs boson  ( the usual sm one ) , three color - octet particles , one cp - even , one cp - odd and one electrically charged  @xcite .",
    "although the scalar - mediated flavor - violating interactions are protected by the mfv hypothesis , the type - iii and type - c models still present very interesting phenomena in some low - energy processes , especially due to the presence of a charged higgs boson  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall study the @xmath0 mixing within these two models and pursue possible differences between their effects .",
    "since the charged higgs contributes to the process at the same order as does the @xmath8 boson in the sm , the np effects might be significant .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0 mixing , which is governed by a schrdinger equation and induced by the @xmath9 transition , plays an important role in accurate tests of the sm and indirect searches for np . in terms of the off - diagonal elements of the mass and decay matrices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the mass and width differences between the two mass eigenstates @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined , respectively , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cp - violating phase .",

    "there are another two interesting observables related to @xmath0 mixing , the flavor - specific cp asymmetry @xmath19 and the cp - violating phase @xmath20   appears in tree - dominated @xmath21 @xmath22 decays , such as @xmath23 , and is generally different from @xmath24 unless the terms proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 are neglected  @xcite . ] ,",
    "which are defined , respectively , by @xmath28 for @xmath20 , the sm prediction @xmath29  @xcite agrees with the experimental data @xmath30  @xcite within @xmath31 error bar . for @xmath32 , on the other hand , the measurement @xmath33  @xcite is significantly different from the sm estimation @xmath34  @xcite , even through they are in agreement with each other at @xmath35 level due to the large experimental error bars . under the constraints of the above four observables",
    ", the allowed np spaces could possibly be strictly reduced .",
    "so , in this paper , we shall evaluate the effects of charged higgs in type - iii and type - c 2hdms on @xmath0 mixing , and pursue possible differences between these two models .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , after a brief review of the 2hdms under the mfv hypothesis",
    ", we perform a complete one - loop computation of the electro - weak corrections to the amplitudes of @xmath0 mixing within the two models . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in detail .",
    "finally , our conclusions are made in sec .",
    "explicit expressions for the loop functions appearing in @xmath0 mixing are collected in the appendix .",
    "firstly , for convenience and consistence , we shall give a brief review of the 2hdms under the mfv hypothesis .",

    "however , due to the large theoretical and experimental uncertainties , the differences in the small @xmath114 and @xmath122 ranges are hardly to be distinguished from each other . the future refined measurement and precise theoretical evaluation for @xmath0 mixing might show a much clearer phenomenological picture for the type - iii and type - c models .",
    "as a final comment , it should be noted that the same analysis could also be applied to the @xmath151 mixing , which is another important related low - energy process .",
    "the charged - higgs effect on it can be obtained from that on the @xmath152 mixing , with the replacement @xmath153 throughout the theoretical formulae presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : wcs ] . however , we find that the bounds on the model parameters derive from the @xmath151 mixing are quite similar to the ones from the @xmath152 mixing , and no any further information on the model parameters could be obtained from the former .",
    "therefore , the constraints from @xmath151 mixing will not be shown here .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the one - loop electro - weak corrections to the @xmath0 mixing within the type - iii and type - c 2hdms with mfv , in which the second scalar doublet is fixed to be color - singlet and color - octet , respectively .",
    "it is noted that , in order to get a gauge - independent result , the external momenta of the heavy quarks inside the mesons should be taken into account , and the heavy - quark masses should be kept up to the second order .",
    "based on the obtained short - distance wilson coefficients of the four - quark operators appearing in the effective weak hamiltonian , and combining the up - to - date experimental data on @xmath0 mixing , we then performed a detailed phenomenological analysis of the charged - higgs effects on this process .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .   while the type - c model gives a nonzero contribution to the wilson coefficient @xmath96 , the type - iii contribution to the amplitude @xmath108",
    "is induced only by rg evolution effect .",
    "2 .   in the case of real couplings ,",
    "the allowed spaces of the yukawa coupling parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the two models are obviously different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realcase ] .",
    "3 .   in the case of complex couplings , due to the cancelation effects among the charged - higgs contributions , large values of @xmath114 and @xmath122",
    "are still allowed around @xmath154 in the type - iii and around @xmath155 in the type - c model , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comcase ] .    the observed differences could be used to distinguish the two models .",
    "it should be noted , however , that their differences in the small @xmath122 and @xmath114 ranges are hardly to be distinguished , due to the large theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "more refined theoretical and experimental efforts are therefore needed for a much clearer phenomenological picture .",
