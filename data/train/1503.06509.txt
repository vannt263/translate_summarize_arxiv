    "now by proposition [ cyclic ] we get @xmath7 . next , suppose that @xmath1 contains at least two involutions , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , with the third element being @xmath11 .",

    "the coset @xmath123 consists of @xmath114 involutions , which can not lie in @xmath124 .",

    "suppose for contradiction that @xmath134 .",
    "now @xmath42 , and since @xmath1 consists of involutions , the elements of @xmath124 have order 4 .",
    "so @xmath0 contains two elements of order @xmath6 , three elements of order 2 and the remaining non - identity elements have order @xmath96",
    ". then the @xmath135 elements of @xmath0 whose order is a power of 2 must lie in three sylow @xmath5-subgroups of order @xmath87 , with trivial pairwise intersection .",
    "each of these groups therefore has a unique involution and @xmath136 elements of order @xmath96 , all of which square to the given involution . but",
    "no group of order @xmath87 has fourteen elements of order @xmath96 .",
    "hence @xmath137 , and so @xmath7 .",

    "before we establish the next result , we first make a useful observation .",
    "suppose @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath11 is an involution .",
    "then a straightforward calculation shows that    @xmath140    [ order3 ] suppose @xmath1 is a locally maximal product - free set of size @xmath6 in @xmath0 , every @xmath5-element subset of @xmath1 generates @xmath22 , and @xmath1 contains exactly one involution .",

    "the elements of @xmath147 are given in equation [ ts ] .",
    "if @xmath148 then by remembering that @xmath149 , we deduce that @xmath101 is cyclic , generated by either @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "for example , @xmath150 implies @xmath151 .",

    "the only remaining possibility is @xmath158 , meaning that @xmath108 has order 3 .",
    "the same argument with @xmath159 shows that @xmath109 also has order @xmath6 .",
    "we can now prove theorem [ msf3 ] , which states that if @xmath1 is a locally maximal product - free set of size 3 in a group @xmath0 , such that every two element subset of @xmath1 generates @xmath22 , then @xmath7 .",

    "obviously it is impossible for @xmath160 to be equal to any of @xmath161 or @xmath162 because these elements are not of order @xmath5 .",
    "if any of @xmath163 or @xmath164 were involutions , then it would imply that @xmath22 was generated by two involutions whose product has order 3 .",
    "for example if @xmath165 were an involution then @xmath166 .",
    "that is , @xmath22 would be dihedral of order @xmath167 .",
    "but there is no product - free set in @xmath168 containing two elements of order 3 , because if @xmath169 are the elements of order 3 in @xmath168 then @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "so the remaining possibilities for @xmath160 are @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "now @xmath174 implies @xmath175 , whereas @xmath176 implies @xmath177 and @xmath178 implies @xmath179 , each of which contradicts the fact that @xmath1 is product - free .",
    "we are now left with the cases @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( which , if it is an involution , equals @xmath173 ) . if @xmath180 , then @xmath183 , but the only product - free set of size 3 in @xmath65 contains no elements of order 3 , so this is impossible . therefore @xmath184 . if @xmath181 , then @xmath185 , so @xmath186 , which has order 3 .",
