    "the aim of this work is to study the effect of a periodic magnetic field of zero average on the dynamic of a free electron gas .",
    "the magnetic field distribution forms a `` magnetic - field lattice '' for electrons , which results in the formation of electron energy bands controlled by the strength and the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "the possibility of using periodic magnetic fields for tailoring the electronic structure is mostly related to recent advances in nanotechnology , which enables to manufacture two - dimensional lattices of ferromagnetic nanocylinders@xcite .",
    "this idea has been already used by us to suggest a system where the spin chirality mechanism related to the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in frustrated ferromagnets@xcite can be measured and controlled externally  @xcite . to detect this effect",
    ", we proposed to measure the hall effect in 2d diluted magnetic semiconductor on top of the nanolattice of ferromagnetic cylinders .",
    "another possible way to create the periodic field is to use an array of magnetic nanodots with tunable out - of - plane magnetization like in ref .",
    "previous investigations of the 2d electronic system in periodic magnetic fields concentrated mostly on the one - dimensional periodic modulation@xcite and , in some cases , on a mutual effect of the uniform and periodic magnetic fields.@xcite the main difference of our work is that we assume that the uniform magnetic field is exactly zero , whereas the periodic field forms a real two - dimensional nanolattice . for definiteness , here we focus on the case of triangular lattice , which corresponds to the nanocylinder structure of ref .",
    "it should be emphasized that the assumption of zero uniform field is very important because it results in formation of well - defined electron energy bands characterized by the electron momentum @xmath0 like in the case of electric modulation . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of 2d magnetic - field modulation substantially changes a picture of the `` snakelike '' electron motion in a nonuniform ( linear - in - gradient ) magnetic field.@xcite    the semiclassical consideration of the motion of electrons in inhomogeneous magnetic field shows that the low - energy electrons mostly tend to localize near the lines of zero magnetic field.@xcite the corresponding effective potential has a different form for electrons moving in opposite directions along the zero - field line .",
    "we found an analogous tendency to localization of electrons in the 2d periodic field . in this case , the zero - field lines correspond to some closed trajectories of electron motion , which is chiral and quantized and which leads to occurrence of equilibrium _",
    "persistent currents_. it should be noted that usually the persistent currents are associated with mesoscopic rings , for which the symmetry of the electron motion in opposite directions is broken by the magnetic field.@xcite however , in our case of the _ `` magnetic crystal '' _ , the persistent currents appear like a periodic array of circular currents .",
    "quite recently a lot of discussions has been induced by the study of an `` intrinsic '' mechanism of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) .",
    "@xcite in the ballistic regime , when the impurities can be totally neglected , the anomalous hall effect is related to the topology of electron energy bands , which can be characterized by integers called chern numbers .",
    "it turned out that the discussion of the intrinsic mechanism of ahe lead to a partial revising of the landau theory of fermi liquid because the transport properties are found to be related to the berry curvature of electron bands in momentum space,@xcite which means that the corresponding topological element should be added to the landau theory.@xcite    some rather simplified theoretical models like the 2d electron gas with rashba spin - orbit interaction or the relativistic 2d dirac model allow full analytical calculation of the berry curvatures and chern numbers . recently , several publications reported calculations of the berry curvature for srruo@xmath1@xcite and bcc fe@xcite using _ ab initio _ methods . in our previous publication,@xcite we presented numerical calculations of the berry curvature of the energy bands of electrons interacting with a chiral spin texture defined on top of a kagom lattice .",
    "however , in the latter case the essential element is the inhomogeneous orientation of the localized spins , which leads to the chirality contribution@xcite to the ahe .    in this work",
    ", we study the topology of electron energy bands by calculating the chern numbers as a function of the intensity of periodic magnetic field .",
    "the model with the periodic field gives us such a parameter , which can presumably be varied in the experiment ( for example , by changing a distance between the 2d layer and the nanocylinder lattice ) .",
    "this way we can demonstrate a strong jump - like dependence of the chern numbers on the field .",
    "we consider a model of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of spinless electrons in the @xmath2 plane under periodic magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "since the electrons move in the plane , the only component of field acting on electrons is the component perpendicular to this plane , which we denote by @xmath4 .",
    "then the properties of the system can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the effective electron mass and @xmath7 is the vector potential related to the magnetic field @xmath4 by @xmath8 . in the following we use the coulomb gauge determined by the condition @xmath9 . in the case of zero average field",
    ", it is possible to choose the vector potential @xmath7 as periodic - in - space ( see below ) .",

    "the low - energy electron drifts along the line of minimum magnetic field , and the trajectory of this motion can be wavy or snakelike depending on the drift direction .",

    "the energy spectrum is discrete ( black points).,width=226 ]    the appearance of persistent currents is due to the chirality of electron motion in the nonuniform magnetic field along the line of @xmath101 .",
    "one can understand it by using a semiclassical picture of the 1d motion in the inhomogeneous field@xcite .",
    "the effective potential for the motion of an electron along the zero - field line is different for the opposite directions of the motion .",
    "it results in a strong asymmetry of the electron energy spectrum with respect to @xmath119 , where @xmath116 is the electron momentum along the zero - field line .    in the case of 2d periodic field",
    ", this chirality of electron energy spectrum should be combined with the fact that the trajectories are closed in circles .",
    "then the energy spectrum is not only asymmetric but also quantized due to the quantization of the motion along the circular trajectory . using the semiclassical picture",
    ", one can find the quantized values of the momentum from relation @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the vector potential along the contour and @xmath118 is its length .",
    "the circulation of @xmath121 along the circle is equal to the encompassed flux , which causes the difference in phases for electron motion in opposite directions .",
    "thus , the condition of quantization can be also presented as @xmath122 . in our 2d model of periodic field",
    ", the ratio @xmath123 can be related to the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the calculation of flux through an isoline @xmath124 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) gives @xmath125 .",
    "figure [ fig:10]-b shows schematically the energy spectrum as a function of momentum @xmath116 along the circle .",
    "the points correspond to the quantized values of @xmath116 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , even for integer values of @xmath126 , i.e. , in absence of the aharonov - bohm effect , the chirality of the motion in opposite directions would result in appearance of nonzero electric current along the circle .",
    "we therefore have identified a novel mechanism for appearance of persistent currents .",
    "here we consider the occurrence of non - vanishing off - diagonal conductivity in the 2deg with periodic magnetic field . as emphasized earlier , we assume that the average magnetic field is zero , so that the ordinary hall effect is absent . in our case , the mechanism of nonzero hall conductivity has the same origin as the _",
    "`` intrinsic mechanism''_@xcite of the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnets , i.e. , the hall effect in 2deg in periodic magnetic field is related to the nontrivial _ topology of electron energy bands _ in the momentum space .",
    "however , unlike the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnets , it does not require any uniform magnetization .",
    "it should be noted that this effect is also quite different from the recently proposed _",
    "`` topological hall effect '' _ in textured ferromagnets.@xcite even though it was proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] to use the periodic magnetic field and 2d semiconductor with magnetic impurities , the only role of the magnetic field was to order the magnetic moments in correspondence to the field periodicity , so that the topological properties of the magnetization profile are responsible for the topological hall effect .",
    "but in the model under consideration there is no magnetization related to magnetic impurities . nevertheless , as we can see from the calculation of the off - diagonal conductivity , @xmath127 , the hall effect is nonzero .",
    "the occurence of hall effect and the quantization of hall conductivity has been discovered in the past in frame of 2d tight - binding honeycomb model with an additional periodic magnetic field.@xcite the phase diagram of this model has two phases with chern numbers @xmath128 .",
    "also , the quantum hall effect without any external magnetic field has been found by volovik in the model of electrons in @xmath129he film .",
    "@xcite in both cases the origin of the hall effect is related to topological properties of electron energy bands .",
    "assuming that the fermi level is in the energy gap and in the absence of impurities one obtains from the kubo formula@xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the berry curvature , @xmath132 is the gauge connection , and @xmath133 is the fermi function .",
    "expression ( [ eq:18 ] ) was first found by karplus and luttinger@xcite in the context of the anomalous hall effect .",
    "thus , if the fermi level is in the energy gap and the temperature is zero , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) can be presented as a sum over fully occupied energy bands @xmath134 where we denoted by @xmath135 the chern number of the @xmath11-th energy band .",
    "the chern numbers are integer@xcite because they are topological invariants@xcite . correspondingly , if the fermi level is in the gap , the hall conductivity ( [ eq:20 ] ) is quantized like in case of the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath94 changes when the gap between two occupied bands is closing and depends explicitly on the dispersion relation around the points where the band degeneracies occur@xcite .",
    "so , the calculation of the off - diagonal conductivity reduces to the calculations of the chern numbers when the fermi level is located between two separated bands .",
    "we calculate numerically the berry curvature ( [ eq:19 ] ) and the chern numbers ( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the computation of the derivative is a hard task because the phase of the bloch state is ill defined and gauge dependent .",
    "moreover , the summation over the first brillouin zone involves a large number of @xmath0-points .",
    "the problem of derivatives can be overcome by expressing the berry connection in term of the matrix elements of the velocity operators : @xmath136 where @xmath137 are the offdiagonal elements of the velocity operator .",
    "this formula is gauge invariant but two difficulties remain , ( i ) we need to calculate the sum over all energy bands and ( ii ) the computational efforts to calculate the elements of the velocity operator can still be important . in practice , the summation over unoccupied bands is usually truncated over a few number of unoccupied bands but a large number of @xmath0 point is still needed to calculate the chern numbers .",
    "recently , fukui _ et al _ @xcite proposed another method of calculation of the chern numbers .",
    "this method has some advantages : one needs to calculate only the bloch states of occupied bands over a coarse mesh of the first brillouin zone .",
    "moreover , the method is gauge invariant . in order to calculate the chern numbers , we define the quantity @xmath138 where the function @xmath139 is defined in the complex plane with branchcut along the negative real axis , and @xmath140 is a small closed path passing by the points @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "the quantity @xmath143 , which is often called the field strength , is the berry phase that a bloch state acquires when it is transported adiabatically along the path @xmath140 . in this formalism , the chern number is given by a sum over the coarse mesh of phases @xmath144 : @xmath145 the last step is to decompose the first brillouin zone into small paths @xmath140 and to calculate the field strength @xmath144 for each small path .",
    "the decomposition of the first brillouin zone is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] .",
    "in the case of a rectangular brillouin zone and a given mesh . the black points indicate the mesh taken for the decomposition of the first brillouin zone . @xmath146 and",
    "the orientation is indicated by the arrow inside the rectangle .",
    "the others paths can be easy deduced using a similar construction.,width=302 ]    we calculated the chern numbers of the first five energy bands of our problem using this method and obtained the results , which are shown in fig .  [ fig:12 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the sum given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) depends strongly on the number of planes waves used to calculate the solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this phenomena , which is not related to any numerical errors , occurs because the truncation of the basis breaks the symmetry @xmath147 , where @xmath21 is a vector of the reciprocal space .",
    "the latter relation is used to prove that the off - diagonal conductivity is an integer when the fermi level is in the gap .",
    "this effect can not be observed in the case of tight - binding models because this symmetry is always verified .",
    "the effect disappears quickly when the number of plane waves is increasing .    .",
    "this figure shows that the chern numbers have chaotic variations which are connected to closing gaps between the different bands.,width=302 ]    the chern numbers of the first five bands are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "these results show that the variation of the chern numbers with the intensity of field looks rather chaotic and there is no simple relation between the values of @xmath95 , for which the band crossing occurs .",
    "it is known that the chern numbers are related to the band crossings between the different bands .",
    "the value of the jump depends on the number of @xmath116-points in the first brillouin zone , where the band crossing occurs , and the dispersion relation around these points@xcite .",
    "although the physical mechanism is essentially the same , the behavior observed here is much more complex as the one obtained in haldane s simplified model@xcite .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) the hall conductivity can be found using the chern numbers , provided that the fermi energy is within the gap . as we can see from fig .",

    "the fermi level position is to add impurities , which would lead to nonvanishing density of localized states in the gap . in this case",
    "the location of the fermi level is stabilized in the gap , whereas the magnitude of plateau is determined by the interval of field corresponding to crossing the gap like in the case of quantum hall effect in homogeneous field .",
    "in the previous consideration with did not take into account the spin of electron .",
    "now we discuss the effect of zeeman coupling between the electron spin and magnetic field .",
    "we show that in the case of strong magnetic field it leads to a small correction of vector potential .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the gyromagnetic constant , @xmath152 the bohr magneton and @xmath153 are the pauli matrices .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath154 is determined by the mass of free electron , @xmath155 , whereas the first term in ( 26 ) contains the effective mass @xmath6 . in the case of semiconductors like ,",
    "e.g. , gaas , the large difference of these masses , @xmath156 , leads to relatively small zeeman splitting .",
    "after a local rotation @xmath157 of the quantization axes along the field in each point , the hamiltonian reads @xmath158 with @xmath159 the gauge field @xmath160 depends only on unit vector @xmath161 which represents the direction of field in point @xmath162 . in the adiabatic regime , the off - diagonal terms of the gauge field @xmath160 can be neglected.@xcite hence , the spin up and down electrons are decoupled , and the effective hamiltonian describing each species have a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) where the effective magnetic field is given by @xmath163 with @xmath164 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath165 depends only on geometry of the magnetic lattice but does not depend on the amplitude of field @xmath166@xcite its flux is quantized and equal to @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "then the gauge field @xmath169 can be neglected if the amplitude of magnetic field @xmath3 is larger than @xmath170 or , in others terms , if @xmath171 .",
    "we calculated the energy spectrum of 2d electron gas in periodic field with the symmetry of triangular lattice .",
    "as we can see , the energy - band structure can be controlled by the variation of the magnetic field strength .",
    "using the realistic parameters of fe nanolattice with the lattice parameter of 100 nm , we have estimated the magnitude of magnetic field as 5  kg.@xcite this value strongly depends on the gap between the nanolattice and the electron gas , which gives a possible way to vary the field strength .    as a 2d electron gas",
    "one can use a metallic or semiconductor layer . in this case",
    "there is also an additional crystal - lattice field but the corresponding lattice constant @xmath172 is much smaller that the lattice constant of the periodic magnetic field @xmath37 .",
    "it means that we can neglect the effect of periodic field of the crystal lattice as long as the energy of electrons @xmath173 .",
    "we found that the low - energy electrons are effectively localized near the lines of zero magnetic field , and in this state they produce an equilibrium persistent currents in form of a ring array .",
    "the mechanism of creation of such persistent currents is not necessarily induced by the magnetic flux through the ring but is rather related to the peculiarities of electron motion in opposite directions along the zero - field lines .",
    "we have also shown that the quantum hall effect can be observed in this system when the fermi energy is located in the gap . in principle , the problem of controlling the fermi level location has been already solved for 2d system with the gate . in a structure with fully controlled periodic magnetic field and the fermi energy , it would result in a large functionality of the structure .",
    "it should be noted that the impurity effects have been ignored in our calculations .",
    "this is justified if the characteristic sizes of 2d structure are smaller than the electron mean free path .",
