    "in order to treat the qcd effect in non - leptonic kaon decays non - perturbatively , it is important for the matrix elements of the local operators to be calculated on the lattice .",
    "a couple of years ago , cp - pacs and rbc collaboration  @xcite calculated all of the matrix elements for the interaction of @xmath3 decay : @xmath4 . using the domain - wall fermion formalism to realize the chiral symmetry required in this calculation , they reported small and negative values of @xmath5 in conflict with the experimental result . in these works",
    ", however , there are several uncontrolled systematic errors coming from 1 ) the small , but non - zero breaking of chiral symmetry , 2 ) finite lattice spacing , 3 ) the perturbative treatment of the charmed quark in the matrix elements , 4 ) quenching effect , and 5 ) @xmath6 matrix elements obtained from @xmath7 and @xmath8 by using lowest order chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .    in order to examine the first three of above systematic errors",
    "extensively , we are performing a quenched simulation with domain - wall fermion and the dbw2 gauge action which improves the chiral symmetry on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the degree of chiral symmetry breaking is decreased by a factor 1/10 compared with the previous work of rbc collaboration .",
    "in addition , the effect of the charmed quark on the lattice can be examined as well as the scaling violation .    in the rest of this article , we present the contents of the numerical simulation and report preliminary results of kaon b - parameter @xmath1 and the matrix elements which numerically dominate @xmath9 rule and @xmath5 . our dynamical simulation to study the quenching effect is reported in refs .",

    "our strategy of gauge generation with a rather fine lattice spacing and well - distributed topological charge is discussed in ref .",
    "since quark mass @xmath10 is introduced as a parameter of the boundary condition in the fifth dimension in domain - wall qcd , localization of chiral modes on both domain - walls in the fifth dimension tends to fail for a heavy quark mass .",
    "however , our small lattice spacing made the value of @xmath11 acceptable as a domain - wall fermion : @xmath12 0.45 .",
    "we observed that , around this value , the shape of the wave function in the fifth dimension was qualitatively similar to that with much smaller @xmath13 .",
    "the small value of residual quark mass @xmath14 0.3 mev demonstrates the good chiral symmetry .",
    "therefore , it is expected that at least for those operators that do not mix with lower dimensional ones , finite @xmath15 causes negligible chiral symmetry breaking effects .",
