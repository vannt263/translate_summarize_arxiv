    "in this paper , we consider the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) driven by lvy noises : @xmath18 where @xmath4 is a @xmath19-dimensional lvy process , and @xmath20 is a continuous vector field such that for any @xmath9 , @xmath21 holds for some constant @xmath22 .",
    "it is a standard result that in this case the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) enjoys the unique strong solution .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the semigroup associated to ( [ ito - sde ] ) . if the initial value @xmath23 is distributed as @xmath24 , then for any @xmath16 , the distribution of @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "we are concerned with the exponential contractivity of the map @xmath27 with respect to the standard @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath28 for all @xmath29 . given two probability measures @xmath24 and @xmath30 on @xmath6 , the standard @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath28 for all @xmath2 ( with respect to the euclidean norm @xmath31 ) is given by @xmath32 equipped with @xmath28 , the totality @xmath33 of probability measures having finite moment of order @xmath34 becomes a complete metric space .",
    "the following result is well known .",
    "[ theorem1 ] suppose that there exists a constant @xmath35 such that @xmath36 then , for any @xmath37 and @xmath16 , @xmath38    the proof of this result is quite straightforward , by simply using the synchronous coupling , which is also called the basic coupling or the coupling of marching soldiers in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , definition  2.4 and @xcite , example  2.16 ) .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite , page  2432 , the proof of theorem  [ theorem1 ] for the case of diffusion processes .",
    "( [ diss-1 ] ) is the so - called uniformly dissipative condition , which seems to be a limit in applications . for diffusion processes",
    ", it follows from @xcite , theorem  1 , or @xcite , remark  3.6 ( also see @xcite , theorem  3.6 ) that ( [ w2 ] ) holds for any probability measures @xmath24 and @xmath30 if and only if ( [ diss-1 ] ) holds for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 . the first breakthrough to get rid of such restrictive condition in this direction for @xmath41-wasserstein distance @xmath42",
    "was done recently by eberle in @xcite , at the price of multiplying a constant @xmath43 on the right - hand side of ( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "see @xcite , corollary  2.3 , for more details , and @xcite , theorem  1.3 , for related developments on @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath28 with all @xmath2 on this topic . however , the corresponding result for sdes driven by lvy noises is not available yet now .",
    "indeed , we will see later that in this case we need a completely different idea for the construction of the coupling processes , and a new approach by using the coupling argument , in particular the more delicate choice of auxiliary functions .    throughout this paper , we assume that the driving lvy process has a symmetric @xmath5-stable process as a component .",
    "that is , let @xmath30 be the lvy measure of the process @xmath4 , then @xmath44 where latexmath:[$c_{d,\\alpha}=2^\\alpha\\gamma((d+\\alpha)/2)\\uppi^{-d/2 }    measure of a symmetric @xmath5-stable process or fractional laplacian , that is , @xmath46 denote by @xmath47 the surface measure of the unit sphere in @xmath6 .",
    "our main contribution of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ main - result ] assume that for any @xmath9 , @xmath48 holds with some positive constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . then for all @xmath7 or for all @xmath49 $ ] with @xmath50 there exists a positive constant @xmath51 , such that for any @xmath52 the following two statements hold :    if @xmath53 , then for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 and any @xmath16 , @xmath54    if @xmath55 , then for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 and any @xmath16 , @xmath56,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is a positive constant depending on @xmath57 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath58 and @xmath34 .    theorem  [ main - result ] above does provide new conditions on the drift term @xmath8 such that the associated semigroup @xmath0 is exponentially contractive with respect to the @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath28 for all @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath7 , the conclusion of theorem  [ main - result ] is the same as that of  @xcite , theorem  1.3 , for diffusion processes ; while for @xmath49 $ ] we need the restrictive condition ( [ main - result-1 - 1 ] ) ; see remark  [ main-1 - 1 ] for a further comment .",
    "indeed , ( [ main - result-1 - 1 ] ) is natural in the sense that , when @xmath49 $ ] the drift term plays the dominant role or the same role ( just in case that @xmath59 ) for the behavior of sdes driven by symmetric @xmath5-stable processes , see , for example , @xcite for ( dirichlet ) heat kernel estimates and @xcite for dimensional free harnack inequalities on this topic .",
    "similarly , in considering the exponential contractivity of sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) , we need ( [ main - result-1 - 1 ] ) to control the locally non - dissipative part of the drift term .",
    "note that ( [ main - result-1 - 1 ] ) holds true when @xmath60 are small enough .    to show the power of theorem  [ main - result ] , we consider the following example about the sde driven by symmetric @xmath5-stable processes with @xmath61 , which yields the exponential contractivity of the semigroup @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath1-wasserstein distance @xmath28 @xmath62 for super - convex potentials .

    "that is , one can not deduce directly from theorem  [ theorem1 ] the exponential contractivity with respect to the @xmath68-wasserstein distance @xmath69 for all @xmath2 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will present the coupling by reflection mixed with the synchronous coupling for the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) driven by lvy noise , and also prove the existence of coupling process associated with this coupling ( operator ) .",
    "section  [ section3 ] is mainly devoted to the proof of theorem  [ main - result ] . for this",
    ", we need more delicate choice of auxiliary functions and some key estimates for them , which are different between @xmath7 and @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the sketch of the proof of example  [ 1-example-2 ] is also given here .",
    "it is easy to see that the generator of the process @xmath70 acting on @xmath71 is @xmath72 in this part , we construct a coupling operator for the generator @xmath73 above . for any @xmath39 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "we set @xmath76 it is clear that @xmath77 has the following three properties :    @xmath78 and @xmath79 , that is , @xmath80 ;    @xmath81 ;    @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "next , for any @xmath84 , let @xmath85    now , let @xmath58 be the constant appearing in ( [ main - result-1 ] ) .",
    "we will split the construction of the coupling operator into two parts , according to @xmath9 with @xmath86 or with @xmath87 .",
    "first , for any @xmath84 and @xmath9 with @xmath86 , we define @xmath88 \\\\ & & { } + \\int _ { \\{|z|\\le a{|x - y| } \\ } } \\bigl(f(x+z , y+z)-f(x , y)-\\bigl\\langle \\nabla_xf(x , y ) , z\\bigr\\rangle \\mathbf{1}_{\\ {    \\\\ & & \\hspace*{63pt}{}-\\bigl\\langle\\nabla_yf(x , y ) , z\\bigr\\rangle \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|z|\\le 1\\ } } \\bigr ) \\biggl(\\nu(\\mathrm{d } z)-\\frac{c_{d,\\alpha}}{|z|^{d+\\alpha}}\\ , \\mathrm{d}z \\biggr ) \\\\ & & { } + \\int _ { \\{|z|>a{|x - y| } \\ } } \\bigl(f(x+z , y+z)-f(x , y)-\\bigl\\langle \\nabla_xf(x , y ) , z\\bigr\\rangle \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|z|\\le1\\ } } \\\\ & & \\hspace*{63pt}{}-\\bigl\\langle\\nabla_yf(x , y ) , z\\bigr\\rangle \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|z|\\le1\\ } } \\bigr ) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z ) \\\\ & & { } + \\bigl\\langle\\nabla_x f(x , y ) , b(x)\\bigr\\rangle+ \\bigl \\langle\\nabla_y f(x , y ) , b(y)\\bigr\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a constant determined by later .",
    "on the other hand , for any @xmath84 and @xmath90 with @xmath87 , we define @xmath91 we can conclude the following .",
    "the operator @xmath92 defined by above is the coupling operator of the operator @xmath73 given by ( [ ope-0 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath93 is a linear operator , it suffices to verify that @xmath94 where , on the left - hand side , @xmath95 is regarded as a bivariate function on @xmath96 , that is , @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .    for any @xmath9 with @xmath87 ,",
    "it is trivial to see that ( [ coup - proof ] ) holds true , and so we only need to verify that for @xmath90 with @xmath86 .",
    "first , we have @xmath99 \\\\ & & { } + \\int _ { \\{|z|\\le a{|x - y| } \\ } } \\bigl(f(x+z)-f(x)-\\bigl\\langle \\nabla f(x ) , z\\bigr\\rangle \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|z|\\le1\\ } } \\bigr ) \\biggl(\\nu ( \\mathrm{d}z)- \\frac { c_{d,\\alpha}}{|z|^{d+\\alpha } } \\,\\mathrm{d}z \\biggr ) \\\\ & & { } + \\int _ { \\{|z| >",

    "this , along with ( a2 ) and the equality above , leads to @xmath102 this completes the proof .",
    "\\(1 ) here , we give an interpretation of the construction of the coupling operator @xmath103 above .",
    "if @xmath87 , we use the synchronous coupling . if @xmath86 , then the coupling operator @xmath92 constructed above consists of two parts .",
    "fix any @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath105 , then we adopt the coupling by reflection by making full use of the rotationally invariant measure @xmath106 ; while for the remainder term , we use the synchronous coupling again , where the components maintain at each step the same length of jumps ( i.e. , from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ) with the biggest rate @xmath109 when @xmath110 , and with the rate @xmath111 when @xmath105 . for the coupling by reflection for brownian motion and diffusion processes , we refer to .",
    "\\(2 ) recently , the coupling property of lvy processes has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding property for ornstein  uhlenbeck processes with jumps also has been successfully studied in @xcite . unlike lvy processes and ornstein  uhlenbeck processes with jumps , it is impossible to write out an explicit expression for transition functions of the solution to the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) with general drift term @xmath112 .",
    "this observation indicates that all the approaches in @xcite are not efficient in the present setting .",
    "this difficulty will be overcome by constructing proper coupling operators for the markov generator corresponding to the solution of the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) , as done in @xcite",
    ". however , different from @xcite which deals with the corresponding coupling property by making full use of large jumps part of lvy processes , here to consider the exponential contractivity of the associated semigroups @xmath0 with respect to wasserstein distances we need a new construction of the coupling operator .",
    "as seen from propositions [ key1 ] and [ key2 ] below , the coupling for small jumps part of lvy processes [ i.e. , the coupling by reflection as mentioned in ( 1 ) ] is key for our purpose .      in this part",
    ", we will construct a coupling process associated with the coupling operator @xmath92 .",
    "for this , we will frequently talk about the martingale problem for the operator @xmath73 given by ( [ ope-0 ] ) and the coupling operator @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the space of right continuous @xmath6-valued functions having left limits on @xmath114 , equipped with the skorokhod topology .",
    "for @xmath115 , denote by @xmath25 the projection coordinate map on @xmath113 . a probability measure @xmath116 on the skorokhod space @xmath113",
    "is said to be a solution to the martingale problem for @xmath117 with initial value @xmath118 if @xmath119 and for every @xmath120 @xmath121 is a @xmath116-martingale .",
    "the martingale problem for @xmath117 is said to be well - posed if it has a unique solution for every initial value @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , we can define a solution to the martingale problem for the coupling operator @xmath92 on @xmath122 .",
    "note that , in @xcite an equivalence is proved between the existence of weak solutions to sdes with jumps and the existence of solutions to the corresponding martingale problem , by using a martingale representation theorem .",
    "recently , kurtz @xcite studied equivalence between the uniqueness ( in sense of distribution ) of weak solutions to a class of sdes driven by poisson random measures and the well - posed solution to martingale problems for a class of non - local operators using a non - constructive approach .",
    "note that in our setting the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) has the pathwise unique strong solution . according to @xcite , theorem  1 , page  2 , the weak solution to",
    "the sde ( [ ito - sde ] ) enjoys the unique ( in sense of distribution ) weak solution .",
    "this , along with @xcite , corollary  2.5 , yields that the martingale problem for @xmath117 is well posed .",

    "then @xmath139 and @xmath140 are two stochastic processes on @xmath141 .",
