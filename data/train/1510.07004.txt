    "given a first order elliptic operator @xmath10 with principal symbol @xmath11 , one can look for zeroth - order perturbations @xmath12 such that all finite - energy solutions of the equation @xmath13 increasingly concentrate along submanifolds @xmath14 as @xmath7 .",
    "there are several examples of this in the literature , the most well - known occurring in witten s approach to morse theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find a general setting for such concentration phenomenon and construct new examples .",
    "we start with a simple criterion that insures concentration : @xmath15 localizes if @xmath16 this algebraic condition implies the analytic fact that solutions concentrate ( in the precise sense of proposition  [ concentrationprop ] ) .    after summarizing known examples",
    ", this paper describes a general method , based on `` spinor pairs '' , that yields new examples . in dimensions two and four , this method produces operators that are closely related to the linearized vortex equations on a riemann surface , and to the seiberg - witten equations on a 4-manifold . in both cases",
    ", concentration occurs along submanifolds defined by the zeros of a spinor .",
    "the concentration condition ( [ co ] ) was previously found by i. prokhorenkov and k.  richardson @xcite .",
    "they classified the complex linear perturbations @xmath12 that satisfy but found few examples , all of which concentrate at points .",
    "their list of examples does _ not _ include most of the examples given here because they assumed that @xmath12 is complex - linear , while in many of our examples @xmath12 is conjugate - linear or there is no complex structure present .",
    "thus it is essential to study ( [ m1 ] ) as a _ real _ operator .",
    "this paper has six sections .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces the concentration condition and describes some analytic consequences .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents some elementary examples , including one that extends a theorem of taubes .",
    "these arise as real linear perturbations of reducible clifford bundles .",
    "example  1 is classical , but already illustrates the idea that concentration occurs when a complex operator is perturbed by a conjugate - linear operator @xmath12 . in @xcite , c.  taubes used a concentrating family of operators to give an interesting new proof of the riemann - roch theorem for line bundles on complex curves ; our example  2 extends this to higher - rank bundles over curves .",
    "example  3 shows how witten s morse theory fits into the general setup of section  2 .",
    "sections [ sec4 ] , [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] give examples where @xmath10 acts on `` spinor - form pairs '' , meaning sections of a subbundle of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a bundle of spinors and @xmath19 is the bundle of forms . concentration occur along the zero set of a spinor field .",
    "these examples are most natural in low dimensions , especially in dimension four .",
    "in particular , examples  5 and 6 are natural perturbations of the linearized seiberg - witten equations .",
    "example  6 in section  5 suggest that there is a localization theorem that generalizes the index localization theorem   [ igor ] to cases where @xmath20 is a union of submanifolds , rather than isolated points .",

    "suppose that    * @xmath26 is a first order elliptic differential operator with symbol @xmath11 , and * @xmath27 is a real bundle map .    from this data we can form the family of operators @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the bundles @xmath30 and @xmath31 have metrics , we can form the adjoint @xmath32 , and the formal @xmath33 adjoint @xmath34 of @xmath21 . with our conventions ,",
    "the symbol of @xmath10 is the bundle map @xmath35 defined by the equation @xmath36 it follows that the symbol of @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the main point of this paper is that such a family @xmath21 is especially interesting when @xmath12 and the symbol @xmath11 are related in the following way .",
    "[ maindefcp ] in the above context , we say that @xmath39 is a _ concentrating pair _ if it satisfies the algebraic condition @xmath40    [ weitzenboch ] a pair @xmath39 is a concentrating pair if and only if the operator @xmath41 has order 0 , that is , is a bundle map .",
    "if so , then for each @xmath42 , @xmath43 where these are @xmath33 norms and inner products , and hence @xmath44    given a tangent vector @xmath45 , choose a smooth function @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "then for any smooth section @xmath48 of @xmath30 , @xmath49 thus holds if and only if @xmath50 , which means that @xmath51 is a zeroth order operator . to obtain , expand @xmath52 and integrate ; this gives @xmath53 where , after integrating by parts , the last two terms are equal to @xmath54 .",

    "the assumption that @xmath62 is elliptic implies that the bundles @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same rank .",
    "thus a generic bundle map @xmath27 is an isomorphism at almost every point . in the analysis of the family @xmath63 , a key role",
    "will be played by the _ singular set of @xmath12 _ , defined as the set @xmath64 where @xmath12 fails to be injective .",
    "the following proposition shows the importance of the concentrating condition .",
    "it shows that , under condition  , all solutions of @xmath65 concentrate along the singular set @xmath20 .",
    "more generally , it shows that all solutions to the eigenvalue problem @xmath66 with @xmath67 also concentrate along @xmath20 .    for each @xmath68 ,",
    "let @xmath69 be the @xmath70-neighborhood of @xmath20 , and let @xmath71 be its complement .",
    "[ concentrationprop ] for each @xmath68 and @xmath72 , there is a constant @xmath73 , such that if @xmath42 has @xmath33 norm @xmath74 and satisfies @xmath75 , then @xmath76    applying ( [ dxiexpansion ] ) to such a @xmath48 gives the inequalities @xmath77 by lemma [ weitzenboch ] , @xmath51 is a tensor on the compact space @xmath25 , so @xmath78 is finite .",
    "hence , by cauchy - schwartz , @xmath79 but @xmath12 is injective on the fiber over each point @xmath80 , so there is a positive constant @xmath81 with @xmath82 . by compactness , there is a constant @xmath83 with @xmath84 on the closure of @xmath85 and therefore @xmath86 combining these inequalities gives @xmath87    [ erates ] a bound of the form @xmath88 on a tubular neighborhood of @xmath20 , where @xmath89 is the distance from @xmath20 and @xmath90 , gives a bound on how the constant @xmath91 in depends on @xmath70 .",
