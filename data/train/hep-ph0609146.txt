    "since the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite most papers on neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath2 ) have exclusively concentrated on its implications for majorana neutrino masses . however , as is well - known , _ any _ model beyond the standard model of particle physics , which allows for lepton number violation , potentially contributes to @xmath2 decay .",
    "thus , the basic physics of @xmath2 decay can be summarized as : @xmath3^{-1 } = \\big(\\sum_i { \\langle \\epsilon_i\\rangle }   { { \\cal m}_{\\epsilon_i } } \\big)^2{f^{\\znbb}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath4 contains some ( unknown , but lepton number violating ) particle physics parameters . to determine the numerical value of @xmath5 input from both , experiment and theoretical nuclear physics , is needed .",
    "experiments limit ( or measure ) @xmath6 , for a discussion of various different experiments see , for example @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ defbb ] ) stands for a nuclear structure matrix element .",
    "different particle physics contributions to @xmath2 decay depend on different matrix elements .",
    "no definite consensus about the value and , most importantly , the error of nuclear matrix elements exist up to now . for a thorough discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath8 is a leptonic phase space integral , its value can be calculated quite precisely @xcite .",
    "this talk concentrates exclusively on particle physics aspects of @xmath2 decay .",
    "the classic `` black box '' @xcite theorem and its recently published `` extended '' version @xcite are briefly discussed , before reviewing constraints on left - right symmetric models and supersymmetry with r - parity violation derived from a lower limit on the @xmath2 decay half - live .",
    "last but not least , expectations for the mass mechanism of @xmath2 decay in light of neutrino oscillation data are discussed .",
    "it is curious to note , that combining the `` extended black box '' with oscillation data @xcite already today demonstrates that there must be a non - zero contribution from the mass mechanism to the @xmath2 decay amplitude , if neutrinos are indeed majorana particles .",
    "from the experimental point of view lepton number violation in @xmath2 decay is observed through the appearance of two electrons in the final state with * no * missing energy .",
    "many different , possible mechanisms have been discussed in the literature .",
    "interestingly , however , one can show @xcite that independent of which contribution to @xmath2 decay is the dominant one , neutrinos are guaranteed to have a non - zero majorana mass , if @xmath2 decay is observed .",
    "the proof of this `` black box '' theorem @xcite essentially follows from the observation that any effective low - energy @xmath9 operator inducing @xmath2 decay will contribute also - possibly at the some order in perturbation theory , for sure in some higher order - to the ( @xmath10 ) entry of the majorana neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a perfect cancellation of all different contributions to @xmath11 would then require a special symmetry and the proof of the black box theorem is completed by showing that no such symmetry can exist @xcite in any gauge model containing the standard model charged current interaction .",
    "this well - known theorem has recently been extended to the case of three generations of neutrinos and arbitrary lepton number and lepton flavour violating processes @xcite . combined with data from oscillation experiments this",
    "`` extended '' black box theorem can be used to show that @xmath12 .",
    "the proof involves two steps . in the first step",
    "it is shown that any effective operator generating lepton number violating processes of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand symbolically for any set of sm particles with @xmath16 , necessarily generates a non - zero @xmath17 entry in the majorana neutrino mass matrix in higher order of perturbation theory .",
    "as for the original black box , one can show that there is no possible symmetry allowing for a perfect cancellation of different contributions to this entry . in the second step ,",
    "then all allowed neutrino mass matrices with @xmath18 are constructed .",
    "it is then easy to show that none of the possible five structures is consistent with oscillation data .",
    "one can thus conclude that @xmath19 is guaranteed for majorana neutrinos @xcite already today .",
    "the above theorem(s ) do not state which mechanism of @xmath2 decay is the dominant one .",
    "two instructive examples , in which the mass mechanism might indeed not be the dominant contribution to @xmath2 decay , are therefore discussed next .      for @xmath2 decay , with its typical low energy scale of a few mev , all calculations can be done with the effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the hadronic and leptonic charged currents , @xmath23 stands for @xmath24 .",

    "many calculations therefore have taken into account only the long - range lr contributions . however , as first pointed out by mohapatra @xcite and confirmed by a detailed calculation of the relevant nuclear matrix elements @xcite , the short - range contribution can be much more important then the long - range one .",

    "the mixing between the active , left ( and light ) neutrinos with the heavy , sterile ones can be estimated ``  la seesaw '' to be very roughly of the order @xmath39 .",
    "then , with a limit of @xmath40 @xmath41 one gets @xmath42 . in the short range contribution , although some cancellation of terms in @xmath43 might occur , no such strong supression is expected . from @xcite and assuming a limit on the @xmath44ge half - live of @xmath45 ys a limit of @xmath46}\\big)^{-1/4 } \\hskip3 mm { \\rm tev}\\ ] ] can then be derived .",
    "note that the limit disappears as @xmath47 goes to infinity , as it should .",
    "note also that the uncertainty in this limit due to the uncertainty in the nuclear matrix element calculation scales only as @xmath48 and thus is quite insensitive to the details of the nuclear model .      in the standard model lepton number",
    "is conserved , because there is ( a ) no right - handed neutrino and ( b ) only one higgs doublet with @xmath16 . in supersymmetric models , on the other hand",

    "a dedicated calculation of all diagrams @xcite , together with a limit of @xmath50 y for @xmath44ge leads to @xmath51 it is interesting to note , that such a small value of @xmath52 generates at 1-loop level an entry in the majorana neutrino mass matrix of @xmath53 ev only .",
    "if the mass mechanism is dominant , the @xmath2 decay half - live is proportional to the ( square of the ) ( @xmath10 ) element of the majorana neutrino mass matrix . for three generations of light neutrinos , this so - called `` effective majorana '' mass can be expressed as : @xmath54 eq.([defmeff ] ) contains a priori seven unknowns : three mass eigenstates , two angles and two phases . with the help of data from neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
