    "based on the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) first - year data @xcite , it was found that the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) seems not to be isotropic at different positions on the celestial sphere @xcite .",
    "the cmb power spectrum for one hemisphere was larger than that for the opposite hemisphere at large angular scales with multipoles @xmath9 .",
    "recently , the similar results were also shown by the wmap nine - year data @xcite and the planck 2013 result @xcite .",
    "it was found that the directions for the hemispherical asymmetry are close to each other for the wmap-9 and planck datasets .",
    "the anisotropic amplitudes were also found to be around @xmath10 for both observations .",
    "thus , the results of wmap and planck observations seem to be compatible with each other",
    ". this might imply certain cosmic origin for the cmb hemispherical asymmetry .",
    "the cmb hemispherical asymmetry implies that the universe is statistically anisotropic at large scales . to be specific",
    ", the angular power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuation could be characterized by a dipolar modulation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the cmb temperature fluctuation originates from the primordial perturbations in the very early universe .",
    "thus the anisotropic power spectrum might imply that the inflationary universe is intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "related to this , the anisotropic inflation could lead to dipole - modulated power spectra for the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "besides the hemispherical asymmetry , these primordial statistical anisotropy might leave more imprints on the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations .    in the traditional inflation model",
    ", the assumption of statistical isotropy guarantees the prediction that different multipole moments are uncorrelated and the cmb power spectra are @xmath8-independent .",
    "thus the power spectra have the diagonal form as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra vanish since the @xmath15-mode polarization has opposite parity to the temperature fluctuation and @xmath14-mode polarization @xcite . in the case of statistical anisotropy ,",
    "however , the off - diagonal correlations ( including @xmath6 and @xmath7 correlations ) would arise and depend on @xmath8-components @xcite .",
    "this reveals that there is mixing of power between different multipole moments .",
    "the diagonal @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra could also appear in condition of the parity breaking .",
    "therefore , the statistical anisotropy together with its origination could be tested by the off - diagonal correlations ( @xmath16 ) and the cross - correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath15 , or @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "actually , liu & li @xcite has found clues that there are abnormal correlations in the wmap data .",
    "however , their conclusion is not conclusive since they could not determine whether the abnormal correlations originate from the parity violation or the data flaw .    in this paper",
    ", we study possible implications of the primordial statistical anisotropy on the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations . for the primordial power spectra with dipole modulation , the cmb angular correlation coefficients are calculated explicitly , including the diagonal and off - diagonal correlations .",
    "their @xmath8-dependence will be shown as well .",
    "the mixing of power between different multipoles would be quantified .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra would be nonzero .",
    "we would point out certain predicted signals for the anisotropic inflation .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section ii[sec : cmb correlation ] , we calculate the angular correlation coefficients of the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations in the generic case of statistical anisotropy . for the primordial power spectra with a dipole modulation , their imprints on the cmb physics would be explicitly revealed in section iii [ sec : dipolar anisotropy ] .",
    "conclusions and discussions are listed in section iv[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "generically , the primordial statistical anisotropy could be accounted by the anisotropic power spectra of initial scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "there is a convenient way to express the primordial power spectra with anisotropy as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the scalar perturbation and @xmath19 denotes the tensor perturbation with polarization @xmath20 , respectively . in the isotropic inflation model ,",
    "the above spectra depend only on the length of @xmath21-wavevector , and thus they are blind for spatial directions .",
    "however , the statistical anisotropy induces the direction dependence to the primordial spectra .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations are usually expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics , i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath12 denotes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the spherical function @xmath23 is measured from the unit vector @xmath24 . by inversing the above expression",
    ", we could obtain the expansion coefficients @xmath25 as @xmath26 in this way , the angular correlation coefficients are given by @xmath27 they are not diagonal in the case of statistical anisotropy , since @xmath25 depend on @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations are evolved from the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations @xmath28 generated in the inflation phase of the universe .",
    "thus the fluctuations @xmath12 could be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the transfer functions . here",
    "the orientation of spherical harmonics @xmath31 is determined by the unit vector @xmath32 , which is along the propagating direction of initial perturbations .    from eqs .",
    "( [ anisotropic primordial power spectra])([fluctuation x from primordial fluctuation ] ) , the cmb angular correlation coefficients could be obtained as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 and an extra factor @xmath35 has been absorbed into the transfer function @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath36 are the spin-@xmath37 weighted spherical harmonics and @xmath38 is just @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "they are used to expand the stokes parameters of the cmb temperature fluctuation and polarizations . in the above derivation",
    ", we have used a relation of the form @xmath40 one could refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar derivation of the cmb correlations .    in the isotropic case",
    ", the primordial power spectra ( [ anisotropic primordial power spectra ] ) would be irrelative to the spatial directions .",
    "thus @xmath41 would become diagonal ( @xmath42 ) according to the orthogonality relation of @xmath36 .",
    "the correlation coefficients ( [ cxxllmm ] ) reduce back to the conventional power spectra . in the anisotropic case , by contrast , the correlation coefficients ( [ cxxllmm ] ) would be off - diagonal because of the direction dependence of the primordial spectra ( [ anisotropic primordial power spectra ] ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 correlations would also arise .",
    "in particular , they could be diagonal only in a special case . in the following section",
    ", we would consider an explicit form of primordial power spectra with dipolar anisotropy which might be related to the cmb hemispherical asymmetry .",
    "in the recent work by chang & wang @xcite , we proposed an anisotropic inflation model to account for the cmb hemispherical asymmetry as well as to relieve the issue of alignment between the cmb low-@xmath43 multipole moments . this inflation model is based on the randers - finsler spacetime @xcite , where the anisotropy is induced by a 1-form in the randers structure .",
    "finsler geometry @xcite is a natural framework to deal with the issue of spacetime anisotropy .",
    "there are less symmetries in the finsler spacetime than those in the riemann spacetime @xcite .",
    "thus the finsler spacetime is intrinsically anisotropic . in the randers - inflation model",
    ", we explicitly showed that the primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbation is modulated by a spatial dipole .",
    "in addition , it is compatible with the constraint on the anisotropic amplitude from the distribution of quasars @xcite .    in the randers spacetime",
    ", the forward geodesic is different from the backward one .",
    "the parity @xmath44 is broken . the primordial perturbation with wavevector @xmath21 would propagate differently from the one with wavevector @xmath45 .",
    "thus the primordial power spectra are given by @xcite @xmath46 where the upper labels @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the initial scalar and tensor perturbations , respectively .",
    "the unit vector @xmath49 denotes a privileged direction in the cosmic space .",
    "the constant @xmath50 is a typical wavenumber which refers to the scale of statistical anisotropy . here",
    "the power spectrum for primordial tensor perturbation is assumed , while it could be derived via the osculating riemannian method @xcite in the randers spacetime .",
    "one should note that the primordial power spectra with dipolar anisotropy are also proposed in other inflation models @xcite .    for the primordial tensor perturbation",
    ", we could obtain the cmb correlation coefficients as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient .",

    ", we calculate the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 correlation coefficients as follows @xmath65 where @xmath66 other correlation coefficients would vanish since the scalar perturbation does not generate the b - mode polarization , namely , @xmath67 .",

    "the off - diagonal correlations are remained between two neighbor multipoles .",

    "there are several reasons for their result .",
    "one reason refers to that the dipolar anisotropy has the scale dependence . as was mentioned above , however , it is difficult to deal with this scale dependence .",
    "the other reason is that the anisotropy is not just a dipolar form .",
    "this may relate to even more complex anisotropic models as they have discussed @xcite .",
    "another reason is that the statistical anisotropy is beyond the sensitivity of the wmap and planck satellites .",
    "maybe future cmb observations could give more stringent constraints on the statistical anisotropy of the universe .",
    "one may propose that the primordial power spectra ( [ primordial power spectra ] ) can not be realized @xcite . actually , this proposition is true just in the framework of riemann geometry . to be specific ,",
    "the fourier transformation for a real field @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 which implies a relation @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the euclidean inner product between three dimensional vectors @xmath21 and @xmath80 . noting that the power spectrum is the amplitude square of the field @xmath81 , one obtains @xmath82 the above equation implies that the parameter @xmath69 in ( [ primordial power spectra ] ) must vanish . in this way",
    ", the primordial power spectra in ( [ primordial power spectra ] ) are reduced back to the isotropic case .    in finsler geometry , nevertheless , the above demonstration is invalid generally .",

    "the finsler spatial interval is given by @xmath83 related to this , the plane wave in a flat finsler space could be given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the wavevector .",
    "the finslerian fourier transformation for the real field @xmath76 is given by @xmath86 in this way , the relation ( [ relation 11 ] ) may be no longer held , namely , @xmath87 the reason is that the finsler metric @xmath88 could change its sign under the transformation @xmath89 , namely , @xmath90 for instance , the randers metric is given by @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a riemann metric and @xmath93 is a 1form . under the transformation @xmath94 ,",
    "the riemannian part is invariant while the 1form changes its sign .",
