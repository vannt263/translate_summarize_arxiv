    "new neutral gauge bosons @xmath1 are a feature of many models addressing the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the phenomenology of possible heavy gauge bosons has been extensively studied in the past .",
    "there are stringent limits on their mass and mixings from precision electro - weak experiments @xcite and from direct searches @xcite .",
    "the existence of a @xmath1 affects precision electro - weak data ( a ) because @xmath5 mixing pushes the @xmath6 mass below the standard model expectation ; ( b ) this expectation is itself modified by mixing , because it depends on the weak angle , the value of which is confused or distorted by the effects of mixing on other observables .",
    "( c ) both the mixing and the heavy particle exchange lead as well to other changes in the predictions for the various observables , implying new terms in the effective interactions relevant to each process and leading to different apparent values of the weak angle determined in different processes .",
    "thus , the limits from precision experiments vary significantly from model to model because of the different chiral couplings to the ordinary fermions . typically , the mass of a heavy @xmath1 must exceed @xmath7 400 gev and the @xmath5 mixing angle must be smaller than a few times @xmath8 in those models in which the @xmath1 couples significantly to charged leptons , including the standard examples from grand unification @xcite",
    ". models with suppressed couplings to charged leptons can tolerate much larger mixings ( several percent ) , with the dominant constraint coming from the shift in the light @xmath6 mass , as is described in the appendix .",
    "such models may be motivated @xcite by the possible enhancement in @xmath9 decays suggested by the lep data @xcite .",
    "the direct production limits @xcite are likewise very sensitive to the @xmath1 couplings as well as to the number of open channels for the decays ( _ e.g. _ , into exotic particles or superpartners ) , but are again typically in the 300 - 600 gev range for grand unification type models .",
    "the identification and diagnostic study of heavy gauge bosons at future colliders has been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to discover a heavy @xmath1 with mass up to @xmath10 tev through its leptonic decay channels , @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , at the lhc , while @xmath14 interference effects should be observable at a 600 gev @xmath15 collider ( nlc ) for @xmath16 up to @xmath17 tev .",
    "if such a @xmath1 exists , it should be possible to obtain useful diagnostics about its coupling by forward - backward asymmetries , rapidity distributions , rare decays such as @xmath18 , and associated productions with a @xmath6 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , for masses up to @xmath21 tev at the lhc , with the lhc and nlc providing complementary information .",
    "( for a review see ref . @xcite and references therein . )",
    "there have also been studies of the present and future constraints on possible exotic particles , such as heavy non - sequential quarks , leptons , or standard model singlets @xcite .",
    "for example , some models predict the existence of a heavy , @xmath22-singlet , charge @xmath23 quark , @xmath24 , which could be produced at a hadron collider by ordinary qcd processes and decay by @xmath25 mixing into , _",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a neutral higgs boson .",
    "typically , the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 decays occur in the ratio @xmath30",
    ". currently , @xmath31 85 gev if it mixes mainly with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "additionally , precision experiments ( weak charged current , neutral current , and flavor changing constaints ) typically imply that the mixing between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is less than @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "similarly , some models imply the existence of new @xmath22-doublets of leptons , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which can be produced by ordinary electro - weak processes , with the lightest decaying by mixing with ordinary leptons . in both examples , the exotic particles are vector , _",
    "i.e. _ , both the @xmath38 and @xmath39 fields have the same standard model transformation properties .",
    "vector particles could actually have bare masses as far as the standard model is concerned , but in most theories there are additional symmetries which forbid these and require that the masses be generated by some form of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "new vector multiplets ( or supermultiplets ) could in principle have arbitrarily large masses since they do not require @xmath40 breaking , and they are the most commonly predicted new type of matter in many standard model extensions . in models with extended gauge symmetry ,",
    "but which do not incorporate constraints of such underlying dynamics as grand unification , supersymmetry , supergravity , or string theory , the mass and couplings of additional gauge bosons are free parameters , and thus their masses can be anywhere from about 1 tev to the planck scale @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , the masses and couplings of the additional exotic particles which usually accompany the @xmath1 are also free parameters .",
    "thus , such models lack a unique predictive power for @xmath1 physics at future experiments .",
    "the situation is different for models that incorporate constraints of supersymmetry : supergravity theories and , in particular , those that are predicted from string theory .",
    "string theory models necessarily include gravitational interactions ( as a consistent part of the theory ) , and supersymmetry is restored at sufficiently large energy scales . in addition , for each of the models the light particle spectrum as well as their couplings are calculable , thus providing a major advantage over models in which both the particle content and the couplings are put in the theory by hand .",
    "unfortunately , there are two major hurdles that prevent one from obtaining unique low energy predictions of string theory : ( i ) by now a very large number of string models have been constructed , and one does not have a first principle guidance to single one model over another ; ( ii ) while these models possess supersymmetry at large energy scales , one does not presently know how to break supersymmetry without introducing new parameters .",
    "both problems are believed to have an ultimate resolution in the non - perturbative string dynamics .    in spite of the above unsolved problems one can take a less ambitious attitude and consider only those string models which have a potential to be realistic . those are string models with supersymmetry , the standard model ( sm ) gauge group as a part of the gauge structure , and a particle content that includes three sm families @xcite and at least two sm higgs doublets , _",
    "i.e. _ , the string vacua which have at least the ingredients of the mssm",
    ". a number of such string models have been constructed @xcite . also , one may parameterize our ignorance of supersymmetry breaking by introducing supersymmetry breaking mass and trilinear interaction terms .",
    "the mass terms ultimately drive the electro - weak symmetry breaking , and thus are of the order of the electro - weak scale .",
    "the models which have been constructed often contain additional @xmath0 symmetries and additional exotic matter multiplets .",
    "a class of string models with the features mentioned above and an additional @xmath0 symmetry provide a testing ground to address the following phenomenological issues : ( i ) a scenario , which specifies the scale of @xmath1 and ( ii ) the mass and phenomenological implications of the exotic particles accompanying the new gauge boson .",
    "we have identified several distinct scenarios , each of which can be illustrated by a specific string model .",
    "a main conclusion is that a large class of string models not only predict the existence of additional gauge bosons , but often imply the masses of the new gauge bosons and the exotic particles which necessarily accompany them to be in the electro - weak range .",
    "each specific model leads to calculable predictions ( which , however , depend on the assumed supersymmetry breaking mass terms ) for the masses , couplings , and mixing with the @xmath6 of the new boson(s ) , as well as for the masses and quantum numbers of the associated exotic matter .",
    "we would thus like to advocate that , from the string point of view , new gauge bosons and associated exotic matter are perhaps the next best motivated new physics ",
    "after the higgs and supersymmetric particles  to be searched for at future experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we specify in more detail the features of the string models and their advantage over sm physics . in section 3",
    "we give the specific scenarios for the @xmath1 masses achievable without excessive fine - tuning of the supersymmetry breaking parameters and constraints on exotic particles accompanying the new gauge boson(s ) .",
    "we show examples in which the additional @xmath1 mass is : ( a ) comparable to that of the @xmath6 ( already excluded ) ; ( b ) in the 300 gev to 1 tev range , which may still be barely allowed but easily within the range of future or present colliders ; ( c ) at an intermediate scale ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath42 gev ) . it is argued that in case ( b ) it is difficult though not impossible to satisfy existing constraints on @xmath5 mixing , especially for lower values of @xmath16 , and that @xmath1 masses above 1 tev are not expected ( given our assumptions ) without excessive fine tuning .",
    "conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the appendix discusses the limits on @xmath5 mixing .",
    "the results presented in this paper provide a summary of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a more phenomenological emphasis .",
    "the more detailed version @xcite also provides additional technical details and illustrations of the scenarios within specific string models .",
    "let us first specify the generic features of supersymmetric string models with the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath43 , three ordinary families , and at least two sm doublets , _",
    "i.e. _ , a set of models with at least a particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "in addition , from a set of models we select only those with @xmath44 , @xmath22 and @xmath45 all embedded into the @xmath46 gauge group , since for other types of embedding the normalization of the @xmath45 gauge group coupling is different from the one leading to the gauge coupling unification in the mssm model .",
    "in general these models also contain a set of particles which are singlets of the sm gauge group , but which transform non - trivially under an additional non - abelian `` shadow '' sector group , and a number of additional @xmath47 s , one of them usually anomalous .",
    "the shadow sector non - abelian gauge group may play a role in dynamical supersymmetry breaking . in addition , there are typically a large number of additional matter multiplets , which transform non - trivially under @xmath47 s and/or the standard model symmetry . in general such models also lead to fractionally charged color singlets , which may have important phenomenological@xcite consequences .",
    "the anomalous @xmath47 group of such models is broken at @xmath48 @xcite by nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of certain multiplets which preserve supersymmetry and consistency of the theory at the loop level of string theory . at the same time",
    ", this mechanism ensures that a number of additional non - anomalous @xmath47 s are broken and a number of additional multiplets become massive .",
    "thus , the enhanced gauge symmetry and the exotic particle content is in general drastically reduced .",
    "nevertheless , there are often one or more non - anomalous @xmath47 s and associated exotic matter that are left unbroken .",
    "the physics associated with these left over non - anomalous @xmath0 symmetries is the subject of this paper .",
    "one should , however , point out that the models discussed in general may not be consistent with all of the phenomenological constraints : ( i ) the models could have additional color triplets in the spectrum which could mediate a too fast proton - decay@xcite , ( ii ) the detailed mass spectrum of the ordinary fermions@xcite may not be realistic , ( iii ) a scenario for the symmetry breaking of additional @xmath0s may not be consistent with phenomenological constraints on the exotic multiplets , such as gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is not clear how to implement the supersymmetry breaking scenario ; we parameterize it by introducing supersymmetry breaking mass and cubic terms .",
    "within the models discussed in the previous section the pattern of additional @xmath0 symmetry breaking is very constraining .",
    "first , the models possess supersymmetry , which relates the interactions of integer ( boson ) and half - integer ( fermion ) spin particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , those between the particle and its superpartner ; second , the the type of particles and their couplings are calculable . with the assumptions that supersymmetry",
    "is parameterized by supersymmetry breaking mass parameters ( and cubic scalar interactions ) , and that dynamical effects in the shadow sector do not break the @xmath0 symmetry , the @xmath0 symmetry breaking must take place via the higgs mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , by giving non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vev ) to spin - zero particles @xmath49 , which are singlets summetry by the vev s of higgs doublets is discussed in @xcite . in that case , it is difficult to achieve a hierarchy between the @xmath1 mass and the @xmath50 masses .",
    "] under the sm symmetry , but carry non - zero charges under the @xmath0 .",
    "non - zero vev s of @xmath49 therefore preserve the sm gauge symmetry ; however , they yield a mass term for @xmath1 , which is of the order of the vev s of @xmath49 .",
    "the analogous higgs mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the electro - weak symmetry takes place when the @xmath22 doublet(s ) acquire nonzero vev ( s ) , giving mass to the @xmath6 and @xmath51 gauge bosons .",
    "we assume that the soft supersymmetry breaking mass - square terms for the scalar fields are positive at @xmath52 gev and of the order of gravitino mass @xmath53 , which is assumed to be of @xmath54 tev .",
    "the appearance of positive mass - square terms at @xmath48 is the case in almost all models that have been explored",
    ". then the only way of achieving ssb is via a radiative mechanism .",
    "namely , since such sm singlets have positive ( supersymmetry breaking ) mass - square terms at large energies , these terms need to be driven negative at lower energies to ensure a global minimum of their potential with nonzero vev s for such fields .",
    "the magnitude of the couplings and mass parameters depends on the energy scale at which they are measured .",
    "the renormalization group equations account for the loop - corrections to the physical couplings and mass parameters , and track the dependence of these couplings on the energy scale . in particular ,",
    "some supersymmetry breaking mass - square parameters of the higgs field(s ) @xmath49 can become negative if @xmath49 have a large yukawa coupling ( of @xmath54 ) to fermions with appropriate representations under the sm gauge group , _",
    "e.g. _ , sm doublets or triplets . in this case",
    "the loop corrections due to such yukawa couplings ( see fig.1 ) contribute to the renormalization group equations for the running of the mass - square terms in such a way that the mass - square term for @xmath49 can be driven negative , while that for the supersymmetric partners of the fermions ( that couple to @xmath49 via the yukawa couplings ) remain positive ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . gev ) , while the mass - square terms for the stops ( supersymmetric partner of the top quark ) remain positive .",
    "] thus , the scale of @xmath0 symmetry breaking depends on both the type of sm singlets @xmath49 responsible for the @xmath0 symmetry breaking and on the yukawa couplings of such multiplet(s ) to other exotic particles .",
    "one of the features which distinguishes string models from the generic mssm is that the yukawa couplings are calculable and thus are not free parameters .",
    "interestingly , for the class of string models discussed in the the previous section the corresponding yukawa couplings are either of @xmath55 ( @xmath56-gauge coupling ) or zero .",
    "thus , if the relevant coupling is non - zero it may be sufficiently large to ensure radiative breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry .    for each of these possibilities the pattern of @xmath0 symmetry breaking and the running of the gauge couplings still depend on the specific exotic particle content and their couplings .",
    "we shall now discuss the possible scenarios for observable sector @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we shall address scenarios in which the electro - weak symmetry is broken due to the non - zero vev of the higgs doublet that couples to the top - quark , _",
    "i.e. _ , a large @xmath57 scenario of the mssm",
    ". a generalization to scenarios that accommodate other ranges of @xmath57 is straightforward .",
    "we will emphasize the general features which hold in each scenario .",
    "however , we emphasize that in each specific model the @xmath1 mass , mixing , and couplings , as well as the properties of the exotic matter , are in principle calculable , though in practice they depend on the details of the soft supersymmetry breaking",
    ".      suppose that the radiative breaking of @xmath0 is due to one sm singlet @xmath58 , that is charged under @xmath0 .",
    "namely , only one @xmath58 has its effective mass - square driven to a negative value at low energies , thus allowing for a non - zero vev .",
    "the @xmath5 mass - square matrix is then : @xmath59 where @xmath29 and @xmath58 denote the vev s for the sm higgs doublet and singlet , respectively , and @xmath60 are the corresponding @xmath0 charges . here",
    "@xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the gauge couplings at the ssb scale for @xmath22 , @xmath45 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the exotic matter to which @xmath58 couples acquires a mass of order @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the relevant yukawa coupling between the particular exotic matter and @xmath58 .",
    "in general , there will be an additional soft supersymmetry breaking mass term contributing to the mass of the exotic matter even in the absence of the relevant yukawa coupling(s ) .",
    "the nature of the @xmath5 hierarchy now crucially depends on the allowed vev s @xmath58 and @xmath29 , which are constrained by the form of the potential . at low energies",
    "the potential can be written for the particular direction with non - zero vev s as : @xmath65 where we have extracted explicit minus signs from the negative mass - square terms .",
    "note that due to the constraints of supersymmetry the quartic couplings in ( [ potential ] ) are proportional to the gauge couplings and thus are _ not _ free parameters .",
    "one encounters the following two scenarios :    * ( i ) : the relative signs of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are opposite .",
    "+ in this case the minimum of the potential ( [ potential ] ) is for : @xmath68 and the @xmath5 mass - square matrix is @xmath69 it is difficult to achieve the needed hierarchy between @xmath70 and @xmath16 , unless @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in such a way that @xmath73 .",
    "the first condition is not normally expected to hold , except in the limiting case @xmath74 . *",
    "( ii ) : the relative signs of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the same",
    ". + the minimum of the potential ( [ potential ] ) now occurs for : @xmath75 and the @xmath5 mass - square matrix becomes : @xmath76 in this case one encounters an interesting possibility for achieving a hierarchy without an unusually small ratio of @xmath77 , provided @xmath78 . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath5 mixing angle is @xmath79 for small @xmath80 the @xmath5 mixing could be sufficiently suppressed to be consistent with the experimental bounds for @xmath81 tev , as is further discussed in the appendix .",
    "one can illustrate @xcite the above scenarios in a particular class of string models .",
    "the second case is of interest , because there a reasonable hierarchy can be achieved without fine tuning of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters or choices of models with unusual values of @xmath82 . _",
    "e.g. , _ such models can provide for a hierarchy @xmath83 , say , @xmath84 .",
    "if , in addition , one has _",
    "@xmath85 , one obtains @xmath86 and the mixing angle @xmath87 . in this example",
    ", @xmath16 is barely within the current experimental bounds , while @xmath88 is too large for most choices of @xmath1 couplings @xcite .",
    "somewhat larger values of @xmath16 and smaller values of @xmath89 may be consistent with observations .",
    "thus , without excessive fine tuning of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , the prediction of @xmath16 is within experimental reach of present or future colliders .",
    "however , when the experimental bounds on @xmath16 exceed the 1 tev region , this scenario _ can not _ be implemented without excessive fine tuning of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters or unusual choices of the @xmath0 charge assignments .      in this case ,",
    "negative mass - square terms are induced for two ( or more ) @xmath0 charged sm singlets @xmath90 , whose @xmath91 charges have opposite sign .",
    "it turns out that supersymmetry constraints for the potential ensure that the minimum of the potential is along the vev direction @xmath92 ( @xmath93-flat direction ) .",
    "along this direction the potential for @xmath58 has no quartic terms ; however , the mass square term depends on the energy scale @xmath13 at which it is measured .",
    "namely , one now has to include the renormalization group improved potential , which along the flat direction is of the form : @xmath94 thus , the minimum occurs near the energy scale @xmath95 at which @xmath96 turns negative . in the case of radiative breaking with yukawa couplings of @xmath54 , it turns out that @xmath97 is much larger than the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms . for the models considered it is @xcite typically four to ten orders of magnitude below @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , in the case of flat directions the scale of symmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. , _ the vev of @xmath58 , is @xmath98 gev .    higher order ( non - renormalizable ) terms , which arise from exchanges of massive ( of @xmath99 ) particles of string theory , are also present in the potential for @xmath58 .",
    "they are of the type @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) and could compete with the radiative corrections included in ( [ flatpot ] ) .",
    "such terms determine the scale of symmetry breaking to be of the order of @xmath102^{1\\over{k+1}})$ ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath103 the symmetry breaking scale is of the order @xmath104 gev .    in either case",
    "the @xmath1 acquires mass of the order of the intermediate scale . on the other hand ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the mass of the physical higgs boson associated with @xmath58 is of the order of the soft supersymmetry breaking mass terms .",
    "the exotic matter to which @xmath58 couples via the yukawa couplings of magnitude @xmath105 acquires mass of order @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ , that of the intermediate scale . in the absence of the relevant yukawa couplings ,",
    "the exotic matter would have a mass set by supersymmetry breaking mass terms , and thus would be of the weak scale .",
    "again there are string models which illustrate such scenarios @xcite , with the appropriate sm singlet multiplets and the necessary couplings to the exotic particles to ensure the symmetry breaking scenario discussed above .    even in the absence of a @xmath0 gauge symmetry it is possible for sm singlet scalar fields to acquire negative mass - square values at low energies due to the radiative mechanism if they have sufficiently large yukawa couplings to other fields .",
    "such scalars generally will not have quartic terms in the potential , and thus they would acquire intermediate scale vev s .",
    "let us briefly comment on a few related topics .",
    "we have seen that under a certain set of assumptions the vev s of standard model scalars will typically be either at the electro - weak scale , or at an intermediate scale .",
    "intermediate scales are of interest in implementing the seesaw model of neutrino mass .",
    "however , one may still need non - renormalizable terms in the potential to implement realistic neutrino mass scenarios @xcite . also , one promising scenario for baryogenesis @xcite is that a large lepton asymmetry is generated by the decays of the heavy majorana neutrino associated with the seesaw , and then converted to a baryon asymmetry during the electro - weak transition .",
    "such scenarios , while very attractive , can not occur if there is a @xmath0 which is only broken at the electro - weak to tev scale @xcite , unless , of course , the heavy majorana neutrino is a @xmath0 singlet .",
    "we would also like to point out that the string models with an additional @xmath0 yield a natural solution the so called @xmath13 problem @xcite .",
    "namely , the mass parameter @xmath13 , parameterizing the mixing the two sm higgs doublets , should be of the order of the electro - weak scale to ensure a realistic mass spectrum in the mssm . in string theory ,",
    "at large energy scales the @xmath13 parameter is either of @xmath106 or zero , thus causing the phenomenological @xmath13 problem .",
    "if , in the models with an additional @xmath0 , there is a coupling of the the sm singlet(s ) @xmath58 to the two sm higgs doublets and @xmath58 acquires a non - zero vev s of order 1 tev , then such a term would provide an effective @xmath13 term of the order of the electro - weak scale .",
    "we emphasize that the radiative ssb scenarios discussed in this paper require the existence of sufficiently large yukawa couplings to drive the mass square values of the sm singlet @xmath58 negative .",
    "this is most easily implemented if there exists exotic matter which transforms non - trivially under the sm gauge group .",
    "the exotic matter will then acquire mass terms given by the relevant yukawa coupling times the vev of @xmath58 , as well as contributions from supersymmetry breaking mass terms .",
    "such exotic matter typically exists in string models .",
    "it is usually vector , _",
    "i.e. _ , both the left and right chiral fields occur as @xmath107 doublets , or both as @xmath107 singlets .",
    "however , if it carries sm quantum numbers it can destroy the success of the gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "such effects largely cancel if the light exotic matter corresponds to complete @xmath46 multiplets , but that is not typically expected in the types of semi - realistic models we are discussing . preserving gauge unification without fine - tuning is a stringent constraint on string model building , with or without an additional @xmath0 .",
    "we have explored the possible scenarios for ( non - anomalous ) @xmath0 symmetry breaking , as is expected for a class of string models with the standard model gauge group and additional @xmath47 gauge factors which survive into the low energy theory below @xmath48 . under the assumptions that the additional @xmath0 symmetry is not broken by shadow sector effects and that the supersymmetry breaking scalar mass - square terms are positive , the breaking is necessarily radiative .",
    "this requires the existence of additional matter with large enough yukawa coupling to the standard model singlets responsible for the @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "then , within a particular model with definite supersymmetry breaking mass terms , the symmetry breaking pattern , the couplings and the masses of the new gauge bosons , and those of the accompanying exotic particles are calculable . in that sense",
    "the string models yield predictions for the new physics associated with the new gauge bosons .",
    "it turns out that for the class of string models considered the mass of @xmath1 is either of @xmath2 or the intermediate scale of order @xmath108 gev .",
    "however , in both cases the mass of the associated physical higgs bosons is in the electro - weak region .",
    "our major conclusion , therefore , is that a large class of string models considered here not only predict the existence of additional gauge bosons and exotic matter , but often imply that their masses should be in the electro - weak range .",
    "many such models are already excluded by indirect or direct constraints on heavy @xmath1 bosons , and the @xmath5 mixing is often too large , especially for lower values of @xmath16 .",
    "the scenario in which @xmath16 is in the electro - weak range allows , without excessive fine tuning of the supersymmetry breaking mass parameters , for predictions of @xmath16 within experimental reach of present or future colliders . on the other hand ,",
    "when the experimental bounds on @xmath16 exceed the 1 tev region , this scenario _ can not _ be implemented without excessive fine tuning of supersymmetry breaking mass parameters , or unusual choices of @xmath0 charge assignments .",
    "string models provide a concrete set of predictions for new gauge boson physics , thus motivating the @xmath1 searches and the associated exotic particle searches at future experiments , as perhaps the best motivated physics , next to that of the higgs and supersymmetric partner searches .",

    "this relation is more general than the string or grand unified models considered here , and assumes only that there is a mass hierarachy and that the mixing is dominated by a single higgs doublet . in the reference grand unified and left - right models one finds ( assuming the simplest higgs structure and direct breaking of the grand unified theory to the standard model with an additional @xmath47 ) that @xmath117 is in the range 0.2  0.6 , so the mixing limits in the table imply lower limits on @xmath16 around 1 tev .",
    "( in most cases the limits are relaxed when one allows two or more higgs doublets to contribute , since their contributions can cancel in the off - diagonal term in the @xmath5 mass matrix . )    for such couplings , the mass hierarchies that can be generated without excessive fine tuning in the string models considered here would be inconsistent or only barely compatible with current experimental limits . however , the string - derived models are not expected to have precisely the same couplings and @xmath0 charges as the models based on simple grand unification , and one could have smaller predicted mixings and/or less stringent experimental constraints .    for example , it is possible that a new @xmath1 has suppressed couplings to charged leptons or to all ordinary fermions",
    ". even if there are no selection rules to make the relevant charges vanish , one expects @xmath118 to be small if the @xmath1 couples to a large numbers of exotic particles . in a unified theory the overall strength of each gauge interaction , as normalized by @xmath119 ,",
    "should be the same or comparable .",
    "this implies that if a @xmath1 couples to many particles , the coupling to each particle individually is smaller , scaling roughly as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the number of particles to which it couples .",
    "( this holds for the couplings at the string scale .",
    "it applies to the running couplings as well if the @xmath121 particles are all light . ) in particular , if @xmath122 is small , then the predicted mixing is reduced .",
    "similarly , small @xmath123 leads to weaker experimental constraints on @xmath88 , since , roughly , the combination @xmath124 enters most of the precision observables .",
    "( of course , suppressed couplings would also make the discovery of a @xmath1 in the future more difficult ) .    as an extreme model",
    ", one can consider a @xmath1 that does not have any couplings to ordinary fermions .",
    "the @xmath5 mixing still affects the precision observables because it shifts the @xmath6 mass below the standard model expectation ( see below ) .",
    "a global fit to all data gives the best fit at @xmath16 = 130 gev , although the standard model ( @xmath125 ) is allowed at 90% cl , and @xmath126 .",
    "to understand this relaxed constraint better , it is convenient to consider the relation @xmath127 between the mixing angle , the physical @xmath6 and @xmath1 masses , and @xmath128 , which is the the standard model prediction for the @xmath6 mass in the absence of mixing .",
    "this constraint holds in all models , even when the @xmath1 coupling to the ordinary fermions is absent . assuming @xmath129 and @xmath116",
    ", this implies @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the experimental error on @xmath70 is negligible .",
    "however , the standard model prediction for @xmath128 is uncertain due to @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , which altogether yield an uncertainty of @xmath137 in @xmath138 .",
    "this uncertainty is increased to @xmath139 if one allows modest couplings of the @xmath1 to electrons , where we have assumed that such couplings can distort the apparent @xmath133 obtained from @xmath6-pole asymmetries by around 0.001 . in figure 3",
    "we indicate the range of upper limits on @xmath88 allowed by ( [ thetamz ] ) for @xmath140 and @xmath141 as a function of @xmath142 .",
    "this is the plausible experimental bound for models with suppressed @xmath1 couplings to charged leptons .",
    "the predicted mixing can be smaller than the grand unification values for small @xmath122 .",
    "it can also be smaller when two or more higgs doublets contribute significantly to the mixing , as is expected to be the case in both superstring models and supersymmetric grand unification ( _ i.e. _ , away from the large @xmath57 limit ) . in this case",
    ", their contributions to the mixing can cancel .",
    "a plausible ( but not rigorous ) range for the effective value of @xmath117 is 0.5 to 0.1 .",
