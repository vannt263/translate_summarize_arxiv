    "<S> perhaps the most traditional and widely adopted way of doing so is through full tomographic reconstruction @xcite , a technique that performs a series of independent measurements on the system in order to uniquely identify its nature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complexity of such a method dramatically increases with increasing dimension of the system , and fully measuring the state of two entangled objects , each of @xmath1 dimensions , requires at least @xmath2 measurements @xcite . as a result , full tomographic reconstruction is effective only at low dimensions and is otherwise prohibitively time consuming and computationally expensive .    </S>",

    "<S> compressive sensing , which originates from the field of signal processing , provides a very efficient mechanism to establish properties of an unknown system with limited observations ( see , e.g. , cands @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> compressive sensing uses prior assumptions in order to reduce the number of possible solutions , which can drastically reduce both measurement and processing time . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is possible to establish descriptions of very large systems that could previously not be explored . </S>",
    "<S> this principle is used extensively in the fields of image reconstruction @xcite and medical tomography @xcite , and it has recently been adopted in various areas of quantum science @xcite .    in this paper we propose and outline a compressive sensing technique that is able to successfully reconstruct the density matrix of near - pure entangled states of high dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we implement this method to reconstruct a pure state of two 17-dimensional photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the recovery of the state is achieved by employing only 3% of the measurements that full tomographic reconstruction would require . </S>",
    "<S> the full procedure , including measuring and post - processing , takes approximately three hours on a standard desktop computer . </S>",
    "<S> our data processing algorithm is similar to the singular value thresholding algorithm detailed in @xcite ; however , its design is specifically adapted for near - pure entangled state reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is fast , computationally inexpensive , and robust to noise .    </S>",
    "<S> * theoretical description of compressive sensing and quantum tomography . *    compressive sensing is a data - processing technique widely used in different signal reconstruction applications . </S>",
    "<S> its aim is to find the solution to underdetermined linear systems , under the assumption that such a solution is sparse in some basis . </S>",
    "<S> such problems can be posed in the following way : @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents a vector describing the measured object ; @xmath5 is the matrix of measurements , with @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the vector of measurement results ; @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9 norm of the vector ; and @xmath10 is a transformation to a space in which @xmath11 has a sparse representation .    in the specific case of quantum state tomography , </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to reconstruct an unknown near - pure density matrix , using an under - sampled set of measurements , under the assumption that such a matrix is low rank . </S>",
    "<S> the problem to be solved is then @xcite @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the density matrix to be reconstructed , while @xmath14 is the density matrix in vector form ; @xmath5 is the matrix of measurements ; @xmath15 is the vector of resulting probabilities ; and @xmath16 stands for the trace norm of the matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the rows of the measurement matrix @xmath17 are individual measurement vectors @xmath18 , and the elements of the vector @xmath19 are the corresponding probabilities @xmath20 .    * the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> *    we develop an operation - projection method similar to the singular value thresholding algorithm shown in @xcite and implemented in @xcite ; however , we significantly modify its design in order to make use of the known features of near - pure entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm requires an initial guess matrix to begin the procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol then has two main stages : ( i ) the operations on the current matrix @xmath13 to impose the desired characteristics and ( ii ) the projection of the resulting answer in vector form @xmath21 onto the solution space . applying these steps </S>",
    "<S> repeatedly constitutes an iterative procedure to approach the target solution . </S>",
    "<S> we interchange between the matrix form and vector form when implementing the operation and projection stages respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]         in the operations stage , two steps are performed : first , the rank of the matrix is reduced by thresholding the eigenvalues below a certain level . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by decomposing the matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors , setting the eigenvalues below the chosen threshold to zero , and then recomposing the matrix using @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 eigenvalue and @xmath25 the corresponding eigenvector . </S>",
    "<S> second , to make use of the known sparsity characteristic and trace properties of the solution , we apply a thresholding operation on the individual matrix elements and normalise the result to have trace equal to unity . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this by setting the elements that have modulus smaller than a chosen value to zero and dividing the matrix by its trace .    </S>",
    "<S> after the operation , the resultant matrix @xmath26 has the desired characteristics of the solution ; however , it no longer belongs to the linear space defined by the measurements @xmath17 and probabilities @xmath19 . to return the matrix @xmath26 to the space defined by @xmath27 , we then implement the projection stage of the procedure . in order to describe the projection stage , </S>",
    "<S> we first introduce a geometrical formalism of the problem .    each measurement vector @xmath18 and </S>",
    "<S> corresponding probability @xmath20 represents a hyperplane in a space of @xmath28 dimensions , where @xmath28 is the number of elements in @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the intersection of these hyperplanes represents the set of all solutions to the system @xmath27 . a simplified version of this concept is shown in fig .  [ coolfigure ] , where two intersecting hyperplanes are represented as two - dimensional planes , and their intersection as a line .    </S>",
    "<S> after the operations stage , the matrix @xmath26 is reshaped into vector form @xmath29 so that it can be projected onto the intersection of the hyperplanes defined by the linear system . </S>",
    "<S> the projection procedure is simple and computationally inexpensive if the hyperplanes are all perpendicular to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> however , although the matrix of random measurements @xmath17 is nearly orthonormal , there is small non - zero overlap between any two measurements @xmath18 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the physical limitations of the measurement procedure . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we transform the system @xmath32 into a new system @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an orthogonal matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by multiplying both @xmath17 and @xmath35 by a matrix @xmath36 such that @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the system @xmath33 is a mathematical construct and no longer directly relates to the measurements and their corresponding probabilities ; however , the set of solutions it defines is exactly the same as that of the original system .    in order to obtain a solution @xmath38 from the initial point @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> , we progressively project @xmath29 on each hyperplane in turn . this procedure </S>",
    "<S> is initiated by projecting the initial point @xmath29 onto the first hyperplane , given by @xmath39 , to find a new point @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this new point is then projected onto the second hyperplane , and we continue in this fashion until the desired solution @xmath38 is found . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs after @xmath41 projections , where @xmath41 is the number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> details of this projection procedure can be found in the supplementary materials .    applying this operation - projection procedure </S>",
    "<S> repeatedly constitutes an iterative method that provides a solution exhibiting the desired characteristics and belongs to the linear system @xmath27 . the schematic outline of the algorithm is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ coolfigure ] , where the orange and red arrows represent the operation and projection steps , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the method is considered complete when the distance between consecutive iterates is below a predetermined tolerance </S>",
    "<S> .    * noise correction . *    in our system , noise manifests itself as errors in the measured probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> such noise is unavoidable , and consequently , the density matrix that we recover @xmath42 will not correspond to the desired solution to the problem @xmath27 ; instead , it will be a solution to the system @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a vector of errors on the true probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> this error in probabilities results in a solution @xmath42 that is in fact some distance @xmath45 from the desired solution @xmath46 in the space in which the algorithm operates . </S>",
    "<S> there are many methods for finding the solution in the presence of error @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , we determine @xmath45 and subtract it from @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the operation @xmath47 we use _ a priori _ knowledge of the desired state s characteristics to find @xmath45 and systematically correct for noise in the system . </S>",
    "<S> further details of our method can be found in the supplementary information .    * </S>",
    "<S> experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> *    we have performed an experimental recovery of the density matrix of a 17-dimensional two - photon state in the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) degree of freedom , produced by parametric downconversion ( see methods for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of each photon is equal to @xmath0 , so the dimension of the entire state is 83521 . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction is performed after 2506 projective measurements , which corresponds to only 3% of the total number of unknown parameters in the state . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of the state is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ real ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the state that we measure exhibits strong anti - correlations in the oam degree of freedom ; that is to say that the oam state @xmath48 in the signal photon is correlated with the state @xmath49 in the idler photon . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the existence of the non - zero off - diagonal elements in the density matrix indicates a high degree of purity in the obtained state . </S>",
    "<S> these two features combine to suggest a high degree of entanglement of the oam modes .    </S>",
    "<S> to characterise the entanglement , we use the fidelity of the reconstructed state @xmath50 with the ideal , maximally entangled pure state @xmath51 the fidelity is then given by @xmath52 for the density matrix shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ real ] , this fidelity was found to be 83.1% .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ]    in order to characterise the effectiveness of the reconstruction method , we reconstructed the density matrix of a 7-dimensional two - photon state with varying number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant fidelities are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fidelity ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results both with and without our error correction procedure . for both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity increases as the number of measurements increases , indicating that more information produces a more accurate reconstruction .    </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case without error correction , the fidelity gradually decreases beyond 20% of the measurements . because the measurements performed are nearly orthogonal to each other and are of insufficient number to yield a fully determined system , the errors contained within each measurement result do not average out to reduce the uncertainty , but instead sum to increase the uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , every measurement taken into account restricts by one dimension the space of possible solutions to the underdetermined system : fidelity increases with increasing measurements at a low number of samples because the space is large enough to be very close to the desired solution , but the space gets smaller with increasing measurements , progressively excluding other low - rank sparse objects . at the high fidelity peak , </S>",
    "<S> the space is small enough so that the lowest rank and sparsest solution it contains is approximately the desired one and the algorithm will converge towards it . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of samples increases , the accumulation of errors results in a solution space that is far from the desired one ; however , with additional samples , the dimension of the space is reduced . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> its distance from the sampled object increases and the algorithm yields an answer that diverges from the desired one .    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed and tested an efficient method for determining the state of a quantum system based on a few simple assumptions . in this case , we use the prior knowledge of the sparsity of the density matrix associated with the system to achieve high - fidelity recovery from a small number of independent measurements of that system . thus the state that we report corresponds to that which satisfies the set of measurements and the initial assumption of purity . </S>",
    "<S> one way to look at this is to say that we have answered the following question :  what is the purest state that is compatible with the set of measurements ? </S>",
    "<S> \" however , a feature of our method is that , using the same measurements and different prior knowledge , it can be readily refashioned to recover many states with a variety of desired characteristics .    in the case of a two - photon entangled state , where each photon exists in a 17-dimensional space with 83521 corresponding unknowns , we are able to recover the system with 3% of the measurements required for informational completeness of an unknown general quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> our result corresponds to one of the largest discrete quantum states yet to be reported . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the techniques implemented in this work will have impact in a wide range of areas in quantum science , including implementation and verification of quantum information protocols using high - dimensional states .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a 100-mw diode laser with wavelength 405 nm , along with a 3-mm - thick bbo crystal , to generate entangled photons through the process of parametric downconversion ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ expfigure ] . the two - photon state that is generated in this process </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 indicates the probability of finding the signal photon with oam @xmath55 and the idler photon with oam @xmath56 . in our experiment , we limit the range of oam states to values between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the signal and idler photons are each incident on a separate half of a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , displaying computer - generated holograms , and then collected by a single - mode fibre connected to a single - photon detector . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a projective measurement on the two - photon mode . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the projection is measured by the coincidence detection with a coincidence window of 25 ns .        </S>",
    "<S> one of the keys to successful compressive sensing is to ensure that the measurement states are unstructured with respect to the basis in which the sampled state is sparse . for this experiment </S>",
    "<S> , that corresponds to measurement settings that are random superpositions of oam modes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the measurement states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are generated from superpositions of oam states where the coefficients @xmath61 are generated at random @xmath62 we generate the matrix @xmath17 , of eq .  </S>",
