    "in recent years the interest in having more accurate models in various domains of applied probability has lead to an increasing attention paid to some special classes of lvy processes related to the stable law , for example : the tempered stable and the layered stable processes introduced by rosiski in @xcite and houdr and kawai in @xcite , respectively .",
    "both families of processes have nice structural and analytical properties , such as combining in short time the behavior of stable processes and in long time the behavior of a brownian motion .",
    "they also have a series representation which may be used for sample paths simulation .",
    "lamperti @xcite and more recently , caballero and chaumont @xcite studied four families of lvy processes which are related to the stable subordinator and some conditioned stable processes via the lamperti representation of positive self - similar markov processes .",
    "those studies are the starting point of our work .",
    "recall that positive self - similar markov processes , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are strong markov process with cdlg paths , which fulfill a scaling property , i.e.  there exists a constant @xmath4 such that for any @xmath5 : @xmath6 we shall refer to these processes as pssmp . according to lamperti",
    "@xcite , any pssmp up to its first hitting time of 0 may be expressed as the exponential of a lvy process , time changed by the inverse of its exponential functional .",
    "reciprocally , any lvy process @xmath7 can be expressed as the logarithm of a time changed pssmp @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we refer to this lamperti transformation as @xmath9 and the details can be seen in @xcite .",
    "one of the examples treated by lamperti in @xcite is the case when @xmath10 is a stable subordinator of index @xmath11 starting from @xmath3 .",
    "lamperti in @xcite , describes the characteristics of the associated lvy process @xmath12 which is again a subordinator , with no drift and with lvy measure given by @xmath13 the three cases of pssmp studied in @xcite are related to some conditioned stable processes .",
    "the first one is the stable lvy processes killed when it first exits from the positive half - line , here denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the second class corresponds to that of stable processes conditioned to stay positive ( see for instance @xcite ) , denoted by @xmath15 . finally , the third class of pssmp is that of stable processes conditioned to hit 0 continuously , denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding lvy processes under the @xmath9 transformation are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "these three classes of lvy processes have no gaussian component and their lvy measure are of the type @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the constants of the lvy measure of the original stable process and @xmath21 is a positive parameter .",
    "we recall that for @xmath22 the constant @xmath21 equals 1 and moreover it has finite lifetime if @xmath23 and , when @xmath24 , it has infinite lifetime and drifts to @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 the constant @xmath21 is equal to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "it has infinite lifetime and drifts to @xmath29 .",
    "finally , for the processes @xmath26 the constant @xmath21 is @xmath30 .",
    "it has infinite lifetime and drifts to @xmath25 .",
    "we remark that such processes have linear coefficients in their respective characteristic exponent that we denote by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "such constants are computed explicitly in @xcite in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "actually it was proved recently in @xcite , that the process @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath37 conditioned to drift to @xmath25 ( or equivalently @xmath37 is @xmath18 conditioned to drift to @xmath38 ) .",
    "finally , motivated by self - similar continuous state branching processes with immigration , patie has recently studied in @xcite the family of lvy process with no positive jumps with lvy measure @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "these lvy processes have the advantage that the law of many functionals can be computed explicitly , for example : the first exit time from a finite interval or semi - finite interval , overshoots distributions and exponential functionals ( see for instance caballero and chaumont @xcite , chaumont et al .",
    "@xcite , kyprianou and pardo @xcite and patie @xcite ) .",
    "we also emphasize that in some cases the wiener - hopf factors can be computed and scale functions in the spectrally one sided case can be obtained . since many tractable mathematical expressions can be computed , this class seems to be an useful tool for applications and rich enough to be of particular interest .    in this work",
    ", we investigate a generalization of the lvy processes mentioned above and we will refer to them as lamperti stable processes .",
    "we also study these processes in higher dimensions .",
    "we will see that this class has nice structural and analytical properties close to those for tempered stable and layered stable processes .    in section 2",
    "we begin by studying the lamperti stable distributions , which are multivariate infinitely divisible distributions with no gaussian component and whose lvy measure is characterized by a triplet @xmath41 , more precisely an index @xmath42 , a function @xmath43 , and a finite measure @xmath44 , both defined on the unit sphere in @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the radial component of any of these lvy measures is asymptotically equivalent to that of an stable distribution , with index @xmath33 , near zero and has exponential decay at infinity .",
    "these distributions have a density with respect to the lebesgue measure , have finite moments of all orders and exponential finite moments of some order . in the one dimensional case ,",
    "the density is @xmath46 . in some particular cases ,",
    "we also prove that these distributions are self - decomposable .    in section 3 ,",
    "we formally introduce the lamperti stable processes and study their properties with emphasis in the one dimensional case , where we obtain an explicit closed form for the characteristic exponent .",
    "motivated by the works of rosiski @xcite and houdr and kawai @xcite , we prove in section 4 , 5 and 6 that lamperti stable processes in a short time look like a stable process while in a large time scale they look like a brownian motion , that they are absolute continuous with respect to its short time limiting stable process and they admit a series representation that allows simulations of their paths , respectively .    in the last section , we study some related processes : the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes whose limiting distribution is a lamperti stable law and the lvy processes with no positive jumps whose descending ladder height process is a lamperti stable subordinator .",
    "finally we illustrate with several examples the presence of lamperti stable distributions in recent literature .",
    "in this section , we define lamperti stable distributions on @xmath0 and establish some of their basic properties . according to theorem 14.3 in sato @xcite ,",
    "the lvy measure @xmath47 of a stable distribution with index @xmath33 on @xmath0 in polar coordinates is of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath44 is a finite measure on @xmath50 , the unit sphere on @xmath0 .",
    "the measure @xmath44 is uniquely determined by @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , for any non - zero finite measure @xmath44 on @xmath50 and for any @xmath42 we can define an stable distribution with lvy measure defined as above .    motivated by the form of the lvy measure of the processes mentioned in the introduction and the previous discussion , we define a new family of infinitely divisible distributions that we call lamperti stable .",
    "let @xmath51 be an infinitely divisible probability measure on @xmath52 without gaussian component .",
    "then , @xmath51 is called lamperti stable if its lvy measure on @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath49 , @xmath44 is non - zero finite measure on @xmath50 , and @xmath55 is a measurable function such that @xmath56 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is indeed a lvy measure on @xmath58 . to see this , we need to verify that @xmath59 on the one hand , since @xmath60 as @xmath61 , as @xmath62 if for @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "] we have that @xmath65 one the other hand , from elementary calculations we deduce @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 , the above integral is finite and therefore @xmath57 is a lvy measure .    in the one dimensional case @xmath43",
    "takes only two possible values , since @xmath69 . in the sequel",
    ", we denote these two values by @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from the definition of the measure @xmath44",
    ", we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore each distribution associated to the lvy processes mentioned in the introduction belongs to the class of lamperti stable distribution . following the notation of the introduction , for :    * the subordinator @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath24 , * the process @xmath22 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , * the process @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 , * the process @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , * the class of lvy processes with no positive jumps considered by patie @xcite , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "note that lamperti stable distributions satisfy the divergence condition , i.e. @xmath84 thus from theorem 27.10 in @xcite , we deduce that they are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "also note that lamperti stable distributions do not belong in general to the class of tempered @xmath33-stable distributions ( see @xcite ) , nor to the class of layered stable distributions ( see @xcite for their definition ) .",
    "this follows respectively from the facts that the function @xmath85 is not completely monotone for any fixed @xmath86 , and that for each @xmath86 @xmath87 the above remarks motivate us to see lamperti stable distributions as a particular class and study some of their properties .",
    "let @xmath51 be a lamperti stable distribution with lvy measure @xmath57 given by ( [ e1 ] ) , then @xmath88 let @xmath89 . if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 in particular , for @xmath92 and if @xmath93 , we have @xmath94    _ proof : _ according to theorem 25.3 in sato @xcite , we need to verify that the restriction of @xmath95 to the set @xmath96 has the corresponding moment properties . to this end , we consider @xmath97 which is finite since @xmath68 .",
    "+ now , we turn our attention to the exponential moments .",
    "consider @xmath98 which is also finite for @xmath99 .",
    "next , we suppose that @xmath100 .",
    "the former arguments imply that for @xmath101 , the lamperti stable distribution @xmath51 has a finite exponential moment of order @xmath102 . in a similar way ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath103 this implies that @xmath104 is finite if and only if @xmath101 .",
    "our next result shows that lamperti stable distributions are selfdecomposable in some cases , and that they belong to the jurek class , i.e. the class of infinitely divisible distributions for which the lvy measure @xmath105 takes the following form @xmath106 where @xmath107 is measurable @xmath86 , and decreasing in @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath51 be an lamperti - stable distribution on @xmath52 with lvy measure @xmath95 given by ( [ e1 ] ) , then @xmath51 belong to the jurek class . moreover , @xmath51 is selfdecomposable if and only if @xmath109 , for all @xmath86 and @xmath42 .    _",
    "proof : _ we first prove that lamperti stable distributions belong to the jurek class . to do so , it is enough to show that the function @xmath110 is measurable in @xmath86 and decreasing in @xmath111 .",
    "the measurability of @xmath112 in @xmath86 is clear from its definition . to prove that @xmath112 is decreasing in @xmath111 , we fix @xmath86 and consider the derivative of @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 hence @xmath115 for @xmath111 , since @xmath116",
    "this implies that @xmath117 is decreasing for @xmath111 and prove the statement .",
    "now , we prove the second part of the proposition . from theorem 15.10 in sato",
    "@xcite we need to verify that the function @xmath118 is measurable in @xmath86 and decreasing for @xmath111 , if and only if @xmath119 for all @xmath86 and @xmath49 .",
    "the measurability of @xmath120 in @xmath86 is clear from its definition .",
    "fix @xmath86 , and assume that @xmath109 .",
    "consider the derivative of @xmath121 , @xmath122 therefore , the function @xmath123 is decreasing for @xmath111 if @xmath124 is negative for @xmath111 . again , straightforward calculations give us that @xmath125 it is not difficult to see that for @xmath109 , we have that @xmath126 for @xmath111 , which implies that @xmath127 is decreasing for @xmath111 . now , since @xmath128 , we deduce that the function @xmath129 for @xmath111 , which implies that @xmath130 is decreasing for @xmath111 .",
    "next , since @xmath131 , we have that the function @xmath130 is negative for @xmath111 , which proves that @xmath123 is decreasing for @xmath111 assuming that @xmath109 , for all @xmath86 .",
    "+ finally , it just remains to prove that if @xmath132 , for some @xmath86 and @xmath42 , there exists a @xmath133 such that @xmath134 .",
    "this follows from similar arguments used above ( take for instance @xmath135 , for @xmath5 , and @xmath33 close to 0).we finish this section with some properties of lamperti stable distributions defined on @xmath136 .",
    "the first of which says in particular that the density of any lamperti stable distribution belongs to @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a lamperti stable distribution on @xmath136 , then @xmath51 has a @xmath46 density and all the derivatives of the density tend to @xmath137 as @xmath138 tends to @xmath29 .    _",
    "proof : _ recall that the function @xmath43 takes two values , @xmath139 and @xmath140 as usual . according to proposition 28.3 in sato @xcite and the form of the lvy measure of @xmath51 ,",
    "it is enough to prove that @xmath141 for some @xmath142 .",
    "but this is immediate because for @xmath143 sufficiently small , we have @xmath144 where @xmath145 . in particular when @xmath146 , the condition in ( [ cond0 ] ) is satisfied and the statement follows.before we state the last result of this section , we recall the definition of a particular class of distributions which is important in risk theory ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) .    take a parameter @xmath147 .",

    "now , we will prove that the tail of the lvy measure of any lamperti stable distributions defined in @xmath136 belongs to the class @xmath157 , where @xmath139 as usual .",

    "in @xcite , we find two examples related to the factorization @xmath574 where @xmath575 is an exponential variable independent of the @xmath33-stable variable @xmath576 .",
    "the first of them is related with the exponential functional of a killed subordinator @xmath577 whose laplace exponent is given by @xmath578 it is easy to see that it is related to the laplace exponent @xmath530 of a lamperti stable subordinator @xmath174 with characteristics @xmath579 , zero drift , and @xmath580 .",
    "the relationship between both laplace exponents is @xmath581 this subordinator is also studied in rivero @xcite , where the author finds its renewal density and other related computations .",
    "the laplace exponent of the second subordinator , here denoted by @xmath582 , is given by @xmath583 and can be expressed in terms of the laplace exponent @xmath584 of a lamperti stable subordinator @xmath585 with characteristics @xmath586 , and zero drift where @xmath580 .",
    "the relation between them is @xmath587        @xmath590 where @xmath591 , @xmath592 is a gamma r.v . with parameter @xmath593 and @xmath594",
    "denotes a certain r.v which is independent of @xmath592 . in this case",

    "are carried over concerning this subordinator .    in the paper @xcite in section 5.3",
    ", the authors found the lvy measure of the inverse of the local time at 0 of an ornstein uhlenbeck process driven by a standard brownian motion and parameter @xmath595 .",
    "this measure is @xmath596 and the corresponding laplace exponent is computed .",
    "it is related to a lamperti stable distribution with characteristics @xmath597    this computation as well as the three former examples can be carried out by recognizing that behind those measures there is a related lamperti stable distribution and applying our theorem 1 to calculate the corresponding laplace exponent .    in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the main processes in study are lamperti stable processes .",
    "all these papers share the property that many useful explicit calculations are be carried out .",
