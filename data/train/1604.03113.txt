    "a lot of progress has been made toward understanding the physics and statistics of ly@xmath2 emission at high redshift ( e.g.  shapley et al .",
    "2003 , ouchi et al .  2008 , stark et al .  2010 , blanc et al .",
    "still , current estimations of the magnitude and frequency of this process are limited by biases that emerge from the sample selection techniques employed .",
    "for example , spectroscopic studies of uv continuum detected galaxies show that only about 50% of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath9 feature ly@xmath2 in emission , while the other half shows absorption ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 , stark et al .",
    "these studies also find an anti - correlation between the uv luminosities of galaxies and their ly@xmath2 equivalent widths ( ews ) , as well as a significant increase in the fraction of galaxies showing large ly@xmath2 ews ( e.g.  @xmath10 ) when going from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( stark et al .",
    "2010 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "narrowband imaging selected samples of ly@xmath2 emitters ( laes ) include , by construction , only objects showing ly@xmath2 above a certain ew detection threshold .",
    "nevertheless , even in this regime , significant differences are seen with respect to the statistics derived from high ly@xmath2 ew lbg samples .",
    "for instance , the ew distribution of laes does not seem to evolve significantly over the @xmath13 range ( ouchi et al .",
    "2008 , zheng et al .",
    "2014 ) , while it does seem to shift toward lower ews at lower redshifts ( @xmath14 , ciardullo et al .",
    "2012 ) . furthermore",
    ", unlike lbgs , laes show very little correlation between their uv luminosities and their ly@xmath2 ews ( ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the reason for some of these discrepancies lies in the fact that different high - redshift galaxy selection techniques sample different regions of the stellar mass ( @xmath15 ) , star formation rate , and metallicity parameter space .",
    "these parameters can affect the production and escape of ly@xmath2 photons through correlations with stellar population ages , neutral hydrogen mass , and dust abundance .",
    "high - mass stars present in stellar populations younger than 10 myr are responsible for ly@xmath2 emission , with the effect decreasing as these populations grow older ( charlot & fall 1993 , schaerer 2003 ) .",
    "ly@xmath2 radiative transfer is also severely affected by the neutral gas structure and kinematics of the ism and circumgalactic medium ( verhamme et al .",
    "likewise , the ly@xmath2 escape fraction is known to strongly anti - correlate with dust extinction , at least for high - ew objects ( blanc et al .",
    "2011 , hagen et al .",
    "considering that more massive galaxies tend to have older stellar populations , higher gas mass , and more dust in their ism , ly@xmath2 emission is severely affected by @xmath0 .",
    "if we take into account that emission line surveys sample a lower range in @xmath0 than lbgs samples due to the first not requiring a continuum detection , ly@xmath2 statistics are highly dependent on survey design and @xmath0 completeness .    in order to assess the effects of @xmath0 on high - redshift ly@xmath2 emission , we present a spectroscopic survey of an @xmath0 selected sample of @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "we conduct this survey with m2fs ( mateo et al .",
    "2012 ) at the magellan - ii clay telescope . using a bayesian approach",
    ", we quantify the @xmath1 ly@xmath2 ew distribution dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "this letter is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our sample and data set . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "we explain our methodology and results .",
    "implications are presented in section 5 .",
    "we adopt a @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17 = 70 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 0.3 , and @xmath20 = 0.7 .",
    "our sample is composed of 629 galaxies in the cosmos , goods - s and uds fields .",
    "every object is observed under the 3d - hst / candels program ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) , providing hst / spitzer photometry from 3800   to 7.9 @xmath21 ( 44 bands for cosmos , 40 for goods - s , and 18 for uds ) .",
    "we construct our sample using 3d - hst outputs ( skelton et al .",
    "according to these , our 629 photometric redshifts satisfy @xmath22 and have a 95% probability of @xmath23 .",
    "every galaxy also complies with a photometric redshift reliability parameter @xmath24 selection to remove catastrophic outliers ( brammer et al .",
    "2008 ) . in terms of @xmath0 ,",
    "our galaxies are homogeneously distributed in the range @xmath25 .",
    "these values are obtained assuming exponentially declining star formation histories ( sfhs ) with a minimum e - folding time of @xmath26 ( skelton et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "spectroscopy of the complete sample was conducted at the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope during 2014 december and 2015 february . to this end , we used m2fs , a multi - object fiber - fed spectrograph . this instrument s",

    "the resulting spectra fwhm line resolution is of @xmath38 .",
    "we reach a 1@xmath39 continuum flux density limit of @xmath40 erg s@xmath18 @xmath29 @xmath18 per pixel in our 6 hr of exposure .",
    "this translates into a 5@xmath39 emission line flux sensitivity of @xmath41 erg s@xmath18 @xmath29 in our final spectra .",
    "a sample galaxy with its reduced spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "flux calibration is performed using five @xmath42 calibration stars on each exposure , with an associated rms uncertainty of @xmath43 .",
    "we are correcting for a @xmath44% fiber flux loss , which corresponds to a point - source ly@xmath2 surface brightness distribution .",
    "we detect and characterize lines across the spectra using an automated maximum likelihood fitting routine .",
    "we assume intrinsic gaussian profiles of the form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 compose the parameter space explored by the maximum likelihood . considering the resonant scattering and double - peaked nature of the ly@xmath2 line ,",
    "gaussian profiles are just an approximation",
    ". nevertheless , these are sufficient four our needs ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we run our line detection code on the 115 sky fibers to account for false positives .",
    "we detect four false lines above 4@xmath39 and none above 5@xmath39 .",
    "therefore , down to 5@xmath39 , we are confident of having less than 5 false detections in our @xmath49 targets .",
    "this translates into @xmath50 contamination using signal - to - noise ( sn ) @xmath51 as our threshold , considering we have 120 detections with @xmath52 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we run eazy ( brammer et al .",
    "2008 ) on candels / irac photometry to obtain our own photometric redshifts ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the 629 objects satisfy @xmath53 ( figure 2 ) , with a median @xmath54 .",
    "they also have a 95% probability of @xmath55 .",
    "from now on , we use our spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath37 ) for detections and @xmath36 for non - detections .",
    "we find a median redshift offset of @xmath56 for detections ( figure 2 ) and assess it in the conclusions . to have our own @xmath0 estimates , we run fast ( kriek et al .",
    "this allows us to use constant sfhs and @xmath37 when available .",
    "our outputs yield a mass coverage of @xmath3 ( figure 2 ) , with a characteristic uncertainty of @xmath57 .",
    "we stress our galaxy sample does not feature any other selection cuts apart from possible photometric redshift biases and 3d - hst / candels incompleteness , which is restricted to our low - mass bin ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we calculate the ly@xmath2 ew in the rest frame as @xmath59 with @xmath60 the ly@xmath2 flux we measure in the spectra and @xmath61 the observed flux at rest @xmath62  from candels photometry .",
    "to reproduce ly@xmath2 ew distributions , the most widely used models are gaussian ( e.g.  stark et al .",
    "2010 ) and exponential ( e.g.  zheng et al .",
    "2014 ) profiles .",
    "we consider both functions and find the exponential to be the most appropriate to represent our distributions : @xmath63 with @xmath64 the heaviside and @xmath65 the delta .",
    "hence , @xmath5 is the fraction of galaxies featuring emission , @xmath66 the fraction of galaxies not showing emission , and @xmath6 the e - folding scale of the distribution .    for convenience ,",
    "we perform our bayesian analysis using ly@xmath2 line flux @xmath60 instead of ew , as introduced in equation ( 2 ) . according to bayes s theorem , the posterior distribution @xmath67 , i.e.",
    ", the parameter space probability distribution given our data set @xmath68 , is @xmath69    as galaxies are independent , the likelihood is just the product of the individual likelihoods for every galaxy , i.e. , @xmath70 . for a galaxy with rest uv continuum flux @xmath71 and uncertainty @xmath72 ,",
    "the single likelihood is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normal distribution centered in @xmath75 with uncertainty @xmath76 .",
    "both values are measured by our line detection code for each object .",
    "we obtain @xmath77 assuming a normal continuum distribution with rest uv continuum flux @xmath71 and uncertainty @xmath72 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the ew model given by equation ( [ dist ] ) , and both @xmath80 and @xmath72 come from candels photometry and our redshifts ( @xmath37 or @xmath36 ) .",
    "the limiting line flux @xmath81 for discerning detections from noise is given by our @xmath82 threshold , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "for galaxies with a detection that satisfies @xmath84 , the single likelihood @xmath85 is determined by ( [ single ] ) . for galaxies with no detections above",
    "@xmath81 , we adopt the value @xmath86 with @xmath87 our detection completeness at a line flux @xmath60 . to obtain it ,",
    "we characterize @xmath88 instead .",
    "we simulate @xmath89 lines on the 115 sky - spectra sampling fluxes of @xmath90 erg s@xmath18 @xmath29 , fwhms between @xmath91   and @xmath92  , and wavelengths of 4800 - 6700  . using the recovered expressions for detections and non - detections",
    ", the posterior distribution takes its final form : @xmath93    with the prior @xmath94 .",
    "this is obtained by assuming @xmath5 and @xmath6 are independent and distribute uniformly in logarithmic scale .",
    "the constant @xmath95 represents the likelihood of the model .",
    "hence , @xmath96 groups every constant so that @xmath97 integrates 1 .",
    "we use a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies to derive the @xmath1 ly@xmath2 ew distribution . to study its dependence on @xmath0",
    ", we divide our sample in three bins covering the range @xmath3 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the observed distributions , along with our recovered models and constraints , are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the posterior distributions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are presented in figure 4 . from these figures , we confirm that both parameters , the fraction @xmath5 of galaxies featuring ly@xmath2 emission and the e - folding scale @xmath6 of the distribution , anti - correlate with @xmath0 . to characterize this effect , we use linear parameterizations .",
    "we define the mass of each bin as its median mass and obtain @xmath98 we also divide the whole sample in the two photometric redshift bins @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "we measure the ly@xmath2 ew distribution for 3 different @xmath0 subsamples and model it using a bayesian framework .",
    "we confirm an anti - correlation between @xmath0 and prominence of ly@xmath2 emission in galaxies , obtaining quantitative relations for the distribution parameters as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "they find a best - fit @xmath116 for ew@xmath117 , but a much higher @xmath118 from simulations .",
    "our results suggest that their composite ew distribution is a result of the broad @xmath0 range induced by narrowband surveys .",
    "we measure a median @xmath56 .",
    "this offset apparently anti - correlates with @xmath0 , i.e. , correlates with ew ( figure 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we attribute this feature to ly@xmath2 line effects on eazy fitting and will address it in future papers .",
    "given @xmath102 and the median @xmath54 , we avoid any detailed analysis involving the broad redshift distribution of the sample .",
    "nevertheless , the trends we recover are also observed when dividing the sample in two @xmath36 bins ( figure 5 ) .",
    "while the methodology we present provides a bayesian approach to deal with high - redshift ly@xmath2 emission statistics , the results allow for comparison between surveys with different mass sensitivity limits .",
