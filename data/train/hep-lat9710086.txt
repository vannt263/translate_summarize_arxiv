    "in a recent study  @xcite we successfully calculated the mass of the @xmath1 meson using staggered fermions . according to conventional lore",
    ", the @xmath1 receives a large portion of its mass from instanton effects . at the fermionic level",
    ", this would mean receiving contributions from zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "these zero modes come with a definite chirality in the continuum and are associated with the topological charge ( @xmath2 ) of a gauge configuration via the index theorem : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the number of right and left - handed zero modes . at finite lattice spacing ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 do not exactly anti - commute , so there are no exact chiral zero modes and nor is the topological charge of gauge configurations well defined .",
    "nevertheless , one might expect to find a few low lying eigenmodes carrying chiral charge .",
    "smit and vink  @xcite verified this sort of behavior for @xmath8 gauge theory in 2 dimensions .    in this work , we set out to study the extent to which the lattice `` zero modes '' reproduce the continuum picture for qcd .",
    "accordingly , we have constructed the lowest few eigenmodes of staggered @xmath7 on both quenched and dynamical @xmath0 gauge configurations ( 83 samples each ) of size @xmath9 corresponding to a lattice spacing of 0.1fm .",
    "we have used the subspace iterations method  @xcite to compute the eigenmodes .",
    "the eigenvalues that we obtain have relative errors in the range @xmath10 for the smallest through @xmath11 for the highest .",
    "the lattice analog of the @xmath8 axial anomaly equation gives @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermion propagator .",
    "the mode by mode contribution to @xmath14 on all the dynamical configurations is shown in figure  [ dg5 ] .",
    "it appears to diminish as @xmath15 increases which can be verified quantitatively by calculating the width , shown in the bottom part of figure  [ dg5 ] .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the continuum where @xmath16 for all the non zero eigenvalues .",
    "figure  [ qg5 ] shows a similar set of plots for the quenched ensemble .",
    "although both @xmath17 and its width show qualitatively similar behavior as before , they seem to drop more slowly with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "the solid line present in all the figures shown so far represents the minimum value of the 32nd eigenvalue in the ensemble , ie .",
    "the line below which we are sure to have found 100% of the modes .",
    "[ dg5 ]    [ qg5 ]    = 2.5 in    the sum in eqn([trg5sf1 ] ) for @xmath18 and 32 modes at @xmath19 on a typical dynamical configuration is shown in figure  [ q05 ] .",
    "the plateau in @xmath2 as the number of modes increases implies that the contribution of the higher modes to the sum in eqn  [ trg5sf1 ] is becoming negligibly small .",
    "although , the plot shown here is for one configuration , a similar behavior is seen on all the configurations , quenched and dynamical . in figure",
    "[ q05 ] , the isolated point represented by a square is the value of @xmath2 obtained from pseudofermions .",
    "the `` true '' value obtained by averaging over 82 copies of noise lies within the band marked by the dashed lines .",
    "since the plateau in @xmath2 lies within this band it is a very good indication that these lowest modes are the topological zero modes which make the dominant contribution to the sum in eqn  [ trg5sf1 ] .",
    "we have compared @xmath2 obtained from pseudofermions and modes on all the dynamical configurations and find that both agree within errors .",
    "on the quenched ensemble , the difference between the two estimators appears to be statistically significant .",
    "this simply reinforces the inference reached by comparing figures  [ dg5 ] and  [ qg5 ] that more than 32 lowest eigenvalues are required to identify an upper limit for the number of shifted zero modes on the quenched configurations .",
    "calculation of hadron correlators on the lattice normally involves inverting @xmath20 to obtain the quark propagator .",
    "when resolved in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath7 , on a fixed background gauge field , it takes the form @xmath21 comparing the full propagator obtained using standard inversion procedures like cg , with that constructed out of the sum above with the available eigenmodes gives an insight into the role of the eigenmodes in determining hadronic quantities .",
    "the @xmath1 meson , being a flavor singlet , has both connected and disconnected contributions to its correlator .",
    "the discussion in section 2 suggests an extension of the analysis to the @xmath1 disconnected correlator which is given by @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate this quantity using pseudofermions and with the available 32 modes .",
    "the ratio @xmath23 of disconnected to the connected correlator for @xmath19 is shown in fig  [ r01 ] .",
    "for the connected correlator , we use the full result available from our previous study  @xcite . on the dynamical configurations , @xmath23 is fit to the form  @xcite @xmath24 $ ] . for staggered fermions , @xmath25 ,",
    "the number of valence fermions equals 4 while @xmath26 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath23 data with 32 modes agree within error with the full result .",
    "= 3.1 in    we find similarly good agreement with only 24 modes though 16 appears to be not quite enough .",
    "the pattern is the same at the heavier quark masses , 0.02 and 0.03 .",
    "we note that this behavior is not automatic as 32 modes are insufficient to yield a good approximation to the true quark propagator .",
    "we find , for example , that the pion is off by a large factor .",
    "based on our knowledge of the staggered eigenvalue spectrum and on recent work done by negele _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with wilson fermions , one might expect that 100 - 200 modes would be needed to reproduce the pion propagator .",
    "thus the @xmath1 is special in exhibiting an extraordinary sensitivity to the lowest few modes .",
    "the quark propagator , constructed out of the available 32 modes , can be used as a starting seed for calculating @xmath27 using cg .    [ residue ]",
    "the benefit of using such approximate solutions as a starting iterate in the cg procedure is illustrated in figure  [ residue ] .",
    "the number of cg iterations required for the residual to converge to a given tolerance drops by more than @xmath28 at @xmath19 . at higher quark masses , this effect is not so pronounced owing to the fact that the lowest 32 eigenvalues are smaller than the quark mass itself .",
    "these conclusions hold only for delta function sources or gauge fixed wall sources built out of delta functions .",
    "quark propagators from noisy sources are dominated by short distance modes and hence there is virtually no improvement in the cg convergence rate when the starting seed is built out of long wavelength modes .",
    "we find that it is possible to identify the shifted zero modes on the lattice since they make the dominant contribution to @xmath29 and @xmath30 . on our dynamical configurations , it seems that the number of topological zero modes must be less than 32 while on the quenched configurations the data indicates that there are more than this number . for most hadronic quantities ,",
    "the approximate propagator constructed out of these topological zero modes is not accurate enough to be useful .",
    "however , a remarkable result of our study is that we find that the @xmath1 flavor singlet interaction on the dynamical configurations is dominated entirely by the quasi - zero modes of @xmath7 .",
