    "the statistical analysis of the weak lensing effects can be used to probe the projected mass distribution in the universe and to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "the variance of the gravitational shear can be used ( blandford et al . 1991 , kaiser 1992 , villumsen 1996a and kaiser 1996 ) , and both the variance and the skewness of the convergence can probe , almost independently , the shape of the power spectrum and the cosmological parameters ( bernardeau et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these papers provide analytical and numerical estimates of these statistical estimators using the dominant order of the perturbation theory of the large - scale structure formation .",
    "hence , these calculations are limited to scales larger than a few megaparsecs at a redshift of @xmath7 . ] to take into account the fully non - linear evolution of the density contrast , jain & seljak ( 1997 ) calculated the variance of the shear using the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum derived by peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "they have shown that the signal is increased by a factor two to three , compared to the linear perturbation theory . more recently , schneider et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( hereafter svwjk ) calculated the variance and the skewness of the aperture mass @xmath8 , which is defined as the convergence measured with a compensated filter .",
    "this statistic , inspired by the cluster lensing analysis ( kaiser et al .",
    "1994 , and schneider 1996 ) , has the nice property to be directly measurable from the shape of galaxies , while this is not the case for the convergence alone which is not observable .",
    "the statistical analysis of the lensing effects may also be fruitfully coupled with the statistical analysis of the galaxy number counts .",
    "villumsen ( 1996b ) has shown how the 2-point correlation function of very distant galaxies is changed due to lensing by the foreground structures .",
    "basically , this magnification bias effect produces an enhancement of the correlation at small scales .",
    "moessner & jain ( 1997 ) extended these calculations into the non - linear power spectrum .",
    "since the bias parameter enters explicitly in the calculations , this kind of study provides an original way to analyse the bias properties .",
    "however , they have shown that the lensing effect remains very small , even in the hubble deep field ( villumsen et al .",
    "sanz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) made the first systematic analysis of the shear - number counts cross - correlations for different cosmological models .",
    "they have shown that , in the non - linear regime , the signal is significantly enhanced .    in a very recent paper , schneider ( 1997 )",
    "calculated the correlation @xmath9 between @xmath8 and the galaxy number counts @xmath10 filtered by a compensated filter .",
    "using linear perturbation theory , he has shown that @xmath11 is much easier to measure than @xmath12 because the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio is increased by the correlation . using this statistic ,",
    "a signal - to - noise ratio per field of up to @xmath13 is achieved , whatever the scale , while it is close to @xmath14 for @xmath12 at @xmath5 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to focus on some properties of this aperture mass - number counts correlation at small scales , and its capability to measure the scale dependence of the bias parameter for a given redshift distribution of the background sources and the foreground galaxies .",
    "the @xmath11 statistic as calculated in schneider ( 1997 ) will be used , but the calculations will be extended into the non - linear regime to the scale of @xmath4 , for a variety of cosmological models . from an estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio , it is shown how the scale dependence of the bias parameter may be measured with reasonable accuracy for a wide range of scales ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 for a survey of @xmath3 square degrees ) , irrespective of the assumed cosmological model .",
    "this provides a way to probe how the bias varies with scale .",
    "section 2 presents a summary of the @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath15 statistics .",
    "a new compensated filter is introduced , which permits simple analytical calculations in real and fourier space . in section 3 ,",
    "the correlation @xmath11 is calculated in the non - linear regime , as well as its signal - to - noise ratio per field . in section 4 ,",
    "a new statistical estimator is defined , which is able to probe the scale dependence of the bias .",
    "the measurability of this estimator is discussed in the light of the previous signal - to - noise analysis .",
    "in svwjk , the aperture mass @xmath8 within a circular radius @xmath16 is defined ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the convergence at the angular position @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the compensated filter ,    @xmath21^l\\left [ { 1\\over l+2}-\\left({\\vartheta\\over \\theta_{\\rm c}}\\right)^2\\right ] , \\label{filt_1}\\ ] ]    and @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is an integer parameter , and @xmath16 is the scale of smoothing .",
    "the aperture mass is related to the tangential part of the observable shear @xmath25 ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 ( kaiser et al .",
    "the compensated filters cut - out the power at the scale @xmath16 , which leads to narrow filters in the fourier space , well - localized around a particular frequency .",
    "however , in svwjk , the filters @xmath20 and @xmath28 are defined on a compact space ( @xmath29 if @xmath23 ) , which produces oscillations in fourier space , and leads to moderately difficult analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "a new compensated filter is introduced here , with a non - compact definition range , but with a sufficiently fast decrease such that it can be considered as a compact filter for the practical use ,    @xmath30    and @xmath31 .",

    "( [ filt_1 ] ) and ( [ u_theta_c ] ) peak at @xmath36 and they have the same width . figure [ plot_filtre.ps ] displays these two filters and the square of their 2-d fourier transform",
    ".    the filter @xmath32 defined as ( [ u_theta_c ] ) belongs to the family of wavelets . note that it would be ideal to use wavelets , which are much more localized in the fourier space , to probe accurately the power spectrum of the projected mass distribution",
    "unfortunately , for our particular case , the real space filter of most of the wavelets oscillates too rapidly to be sampled enough by the discrete distribution of the galaxies .",
    "the filter ( [ u_theta_c ] ) seems to be a good compromise , and it is used for this work .    in svwjk , the dispersion of @xmath37 is calculated to be    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the comoving distance to a redshift @xmath40 ( and @xmath41 ) ) , @xmath42 is the comoving angular diameter distance , and @xmath43 is the time - evolving 3-d power spectrum .",
    "@xmath44 is the density parameter , and @xmath45 is the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "the function @xmath46 depends on the redshift distribution of the sources @xmath47 .",
    "the aperture mass @xmath8 should now be correlated with a distribution of galaxies along the same line of sight . from a practical point of view , it is easier to measure the redshift of the nearest galaxies , and in the following we assumed that the number counts are done in a foreground distribution of galaxies , but it is worth to note that in general , this restriction is not necessary . following the standard bias theory ,",
    "the galaxy density contrast @xmath48 is related to the mass density contrast @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    the expected number density contrast of galaxies in the direction @xmath19 is then    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the mean number density of galaxies , @xmath53 the number density of galaxies on the direction @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the redshift distribution of the foreground galaxies .",
    "if the filtered number counts are defined as @xmath56 , the dispersion of the galaxy number counts is given by ( schneider 1997 )    @xmath57    while the cross - correlation @xmath58 is    @xmath59",

    "the corresponding cosmological parameters are eds , open ( @xmath62 ) and flat ( @xmath63 ) universes .",
    "the fourth model is an eds universe with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , corresponding to the cluster abundance normalization .",

    "for the background sources we assume @xmath70 , and for the foreground we take @xmath71 , with four different values for @xmath72 .",
    "the foreground distribution is quite narrow , and does not overlap much with the background galaxies .",
    "we assume that it is no problem to derive @xmath73 from observations since the redshifts @xmath69 are small , making these distribution observable directly from photometric redshifts , if spectroscopic redshifts are not available .",

    "@xmath74 versus smoothing angle @xmath16 is plotted for the four cosmological models , for both the linear ( thin curves ) and the non - linear ( thick curves ) power spectra .",
    "the four plots correspond to the four different foreground redshift distributions . at small scales and for the non - linear power spectrum ,",
    "the signal is strongly enhanced , by more than a factor three .",
    "this confirms that the linear evolution is negligible at these scales ( sanz et al .",
    "1997 ) . in fourier space , the compensated filter peaks around @xmath75 rather than @xmath76 for a top hat filter",
    "thus , the scale at which the linear and the non - linear evolution of the structures are equal is shifted to larger scale , compare to the case of a top - hat filter ( jain & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "the curves are shifted towards smaller scales when the foreground galaxies are located at higher redshifts .",
    "this is due to the fact that at higher redshift , a given angular scale corresponds to a larger physical scale , where the non - linear power spectrum is closer to the linear power spectrum , and that at high redshift , the power spectrum is less evolved than at small redshift . for the non - linear power spectrum , the peak in @xmath77",
    "is shifted to small scales compared to the linear power spectrum because of the transfer of power from the larger to the smaller scales ( this was also observed for the @xmath8 statistic , see svwjk ) .",
    "figure [ plot_z_f.ps ] shows @xmath78 versus the redshift @xmath69 of the foreground galaxies , where the redshift distribution ( [ p_z_def ] ) is used .",
    "the two plots correspond to @xmath79 ( left ) and @xmath80 ( right ) . at scale of @xmath4",
    "the contribution of the linear evolution to the correlation is again very small .",
    "the maximum of the correlation is obtained for foreground galaxies located at relatively low redshift , compared to the mean redshift of the background galaxies ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the reason is that for a given smoothing scale , a lower redshift corresponds to a higher density contrast , which means a stronger signal .",
    "moreover this effect is more important for the non - linear power spectrum where a _",
    "is clearly seen compared to the linear power spectrum .",
    "the same practical estimators for @xmath8 and @xmath82 as those introduced in schneider ( 1997 ) are used to estimate the noise of this statistic ,    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the position and the tangential component of the ellipticity of the @xmath86 galaxy , @xmath87 is a radius cut of the filter ( otherwise , it extends to infinity ) , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively the number of galaxies found in the foreground population , and those used for the determination of the shear , in the region limited by the radial cut .",
    "@xmath87 may be choose arbitrarly , according to figure [ plot_filtre.ps ] one could decide @xmath90 in the center of the whole field , and @xmath91 at the edge of the field .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath92 is given by the square root of the expectation value @xmath93- e^2\\left[m_{\\rm ap}(\\theta_{\\rm c}){\\cal n}(\\theta_{\\rm c})\\right]$ ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise is defined as the measured signal divided by the standard deviation of @xmath94 obtained in the case of no correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "this standard deviation is simply the square root of @xmath95e\\left[{\\cal n}^2(\\theta_{\\rm c})\\right]$ ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise @xmath96 of the cross - correlation @xmath94 for one field is thus ( cf schneider 1997 ) ,    @xmath97^{1/2}\\left[\\langle { \\cal n}^2(\\theta_{\\rm c})\\rangle + { \\tilde g \\over   n_{\\rm f}}\\right]^{1/2 } } , \\label{s_n_def}\\ ] ]    where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the dispersion of the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies .",
    "figure [ plot_s_n_nl.ps ] shows the signal - to - noise ratio given by ( [ s_n_def ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the mean number density of the foreground galaxies is @xmath101 and that the number density of the background galaxies is @xmath102 , with @xmath103 .",
    "we find that @xmath96 remains almost constant for scales @xmath104 whatever the cosmology .",
    "this result was found by schneider ( 1997 ) for an eds model and a power law spectrum . unfortunately , this is no longer valid at small scales ( few arcmin ) , where the effect of intrinsic ellipticities and the discrete distribution of the galaxies become dominant .",
    "the increase of the signal compared to the noise is stronger in the case of the non - linear power spectrum , this is why at small scales , @xmath96 is always higher for a non - linear power spectrum .",
    "the redshift of the foreground galaxies is also an important factor , we see that @xmath96 decreases significantly if @xmath105 .",
    "fortunately , even with this dramatic decrease of @xmath96 at small scales , it remains higher than for the @xmath12 statistic , where @xmath96 is close to @xmath14 ( svwjk ) .",
    "as quoted in schneider ( 1997 ) , this makes the background - foreground correlation statistic more interesting for the detection of cosmic shear , in particular if the size of the catalogues used for lensing analysis are not larger than a few square degrees .",
    "equation ( [ mn_def ] ) provides that a direct estimate of the bias parameter , provided the cosmological model is known . to investigate the bias properties",
    ", we define the ratio @xmath0    @xmath106    which is independent of the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "it is easy to show from ( [ mn_def ] ) and ( [ n2_def ] ) that in the case of a power law power spectrum @xmath107 , @xmath0 is independent of scale ,    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the linear growth factor of the density perturbations .",
    "this property offers the possibility to measure the scale dependence of the bias ( if it exists ) because @xmath110 , and @xmath0 is a measurable quantity .",
    "a measure of the bias itself is also possible , but it requires the knowledge of the cosmological parameters , and the slope of the power spectrum",
    ". moreover , the background and foreground redshift distributions have to be known .",
    "thus only the effects of a scale dependent bias will be investigated here .",
    "the true power spectrum is certainly not a power law and @xmath0 may depend in a complicated way on the cosmology , the smoothing scale , the power spectrum , and the redshift distributions .",
    "all these things coupled together , @xmath1 is no longer scale - independent .",
    "fortunately , the compensated filter @xmath32 is very narrow in fourier space , and even for a general power spectrum , it is fully justified to approximate it locally as a power law , with a local effective slope @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , since in practice one can select the foreground galaxies in a narrow redshift range , both the redshift and wavevector integrations in ( [ mn_def ] ) are very localized .",
    "hence , the local approximation of a general power spectrum by a power law is very reasonable .",
    "if @xmath6 is only redshift dependent , this dependence can be absorbed by the function @xmath112 , and @xmath0 remains scale - independent .",
    "however , if @xmath6 is in addition scale dependent , it means that @xmath6 depends on the 3-d wavevector @xmath113 . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that the redshift and the wavevector dependences are separable .",
    "fry and gazta@xmath114aga ( 1993 ) proposed to model such a bias as a convolution ,    @xmath115    in that case , since @xmath6 is not a constant , @xmath0 is no longer inversely proportional to @xmath6 , because it should be included in the projection effects .",
    "this drawback is avoided if the foreground redshift distribution is narrow , and if the fourier transform of the aperture filter is narrow , such that the @xmath116 integration in ( [ mn_def ] ) is performed on a very narrow range , and @xmath6 can be approximated as `` locally '' independent of redshift and scale .",
    "this is the reason for choosing the foreground redshift distributions ( figure [ plot_red.ps ] ) to be so narrow .",
    "these remarks are rather phenomenological , but they illustrate what happens in the case of a general power spectrum for which @xmath0 is intrinsically scale dependent .",
    "figure [ plot_r_val.ps ] shows @xmath1 versus the smoothing scale @xmath16 for the cosmological models considered before .",
    "the linear and non - linear power spectra give almost the same results , thus only the thick lines corresponding to the non - linear power spectrum are shown here .",
    "the flatness of the curves is remarkable , and confirms that even for a general power spectrum , @xmath0 depends weakly on scale .",
    "the amplitude depends on the cosmology , the shape of the power spectrum , as well as on the redshift distribution of the foreground and background galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that the non - linear power spectrum may also be approximated locally as a power law , because @xmath0 is independent on scale .",
    "this impressive flatness of @xmath0 versus the scale for a general power spectrum should be discussed , because it is not so intuitive . indeed ,",
    "for non power - law power spectra , the effective index @xmath111 must be scale dependent .",
    "the very small variation of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath16 in figure [ plot_r_val.ps ] means that the value of the effective index has no strong influence on the value of @xmath0 , in other words , the dependence of the numerator and the denominator on @xmath111 should nearly cancel .",
    "this is indeed the case : if a sharply peaked redshift distribution for the foreground galaxies around @xmath69 is considered in ( [ r_def ] ) , one finds    @xmath117    thus it is not surprising that @xmath0 does not depends on @xmath118 provided that the foreground redshift distribution is narrow . to check this assertion , three other power spectra",
    "have been tested : the baugh & gazta@xmath114aga ( 1996 ) power spectrum ( which behaves like @xmath119 at large @xmath120 ) ,    @xmath121^{3/2}},\\ ] ]    where ] @xmath122 , and two power law spectra @xmath107 , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 from these three power spectra are almost the same as the values plotted in figure [ plot_r_val.ps ] .",
    "the difference is always smaller than 3% , the worst case is for @xmath124 , @xmath125 for which a variation of 5% is obtained only for @xmath126 .",
    "these results confirm that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath118 at least for @xmath127 $ ] , in addition to be independent of scale .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is a direct estimator of the bias and the cosmology , nearly independent of the power spectrum and the smoothing scale .",
    "using other calculations of @xmath1 for different cosmologies , and for @xmath125 , a power law fit to the @xmath44 dependence of @xmath1 ( with a zero cosmological constant ) gives    @xmath128    the proportionality constant and the exponant @xmath129 should both depend on the foreground and background redshift distributions .",
    "whether these numbers depend in a crucial way on these distributions will be investigated in a future work , but it is worth to note that @xmath1 remains a discrimator of the bias and the cosmology , almost independent of the power spectrum and the smoothing scale .",
    "this encouraging result is motivating for the detection of a possible variation of the bias with the scale , using the measurable quantity @xmath2 ,    @xmath130    @xmath2 has the advantage of being only bias dependent .",
    "figure [ plot_r.ps ] shows @xmath2 versus the smoothing scale @xmath16 . for the wide range of scales",
    "@xmath131 $ ] considered here , this ratio remains very close to @xmath132 with a variation smaller than @xmath133 whatever the cosmological model , and whatever the redshift distribution of the foreground galaxies , provided that @xmath6 is scale independent .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "it means that the degeneracy between the bias parameter and the other cosmological parameters and the power spectrum may be partially removed by choosing a particular filtering in the @xmath113 and redshift spaces .",
    "the consequence here is to allow a measurement of the scale dependence of the bias without any knowledge of the cosmological model .    according to bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , the bias may be redshift dependent @xmath134",
    ". the effect of the introduction of this dependence has been calculated , and it changes the values of @xmath2 by less than 0.001% , because @xmath112 is chosen to be sufficiently narrow ; only the amplitude of @xmath0 is changed , which does not affect @xmath2 .",
    "calculations with a different power spectrum ( baugh & gazta@xmath135aga 1996 ) , and different redshift distributions for the background galaxies ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) have also been performed , and it is found that the change of the shape of @xmath2 versus @xmath16 is less than 0.5% for smoothing scales larger than @xmath138 , and insignificant for smaller scales . thus @xmath2 is an estimator of the scale dependence of the bias almost independently of the redshift distribution of the background galaxies and of any hypothesis of the power spectrum and the cosmological parameters .",
    "next , estimates of the dispersion of @xmath2 for a given number @xmath139 of fields of size @xmath16 are given .",
    "to calculate it , the dispersion of @xmath140 and of @xmath141 are required .",
    "the former has already been calculated ( eq.([s_n_def ] ) and figure [ plot_s_n_nl.ps ] give the signal - to - noise ) , but the latter remains difficult to estimate .",
    "however , @xmath142 can be assumed to be known very precisely from the existing and forthcoming large galaxy catalogues because the redshift of the foreground galaxies is chosen to be quite low ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "therefore the dispersion of @xmath142 is neglected in estimating the dispersion of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath142 is estimated from a different catalogue than the catalogue used for @xmath58 , then it is important to have the same selection criteria for the foreground galaxies of both catalogues",
    ". otherwise , the bias factor in the numerator and the denominator of ( [ r_def ] ) may not be the same .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath2 will be derived in the limit of a small correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath144 , which in fact correspond to a determination of the signal - to - noise of @xmath2 rather than the complete calculation of the dispersion .",
    "if one observes more than one field , the signal - to - noise of @xmath145 will be reduced by a factor @xmath146 , and if @xmath147 , the dispersion of @xmath148 is small compared to @xmath132 so that the dispersion of @xmath2 is simply    @xmath149    where @xmath96 is the signal - to - noise of @xmath145 at the scale @xmath16 , given by eq.([s_n_def ] ) .",
    "@xmath150 is derived in appendix a.    the reason why @xmath2 is normalized to its value at @xmath4 is to minimize the error on @xmath2 .",
    "the dispersion @xmath150 is calculated by taking for @xmath151 and @xmath152 the values found in figure [ plot_s_n_nl.ps ] , averaged over the four cosmological models for each smoothing scale , and for the non - linear power spectrum .",
    "figure [ plot_er.ps ] shows the expected error bars for a survey of @xmath3 square - degrees .",
    "the number of fields of diameter @xmath153 ( in arcmin ) is given by @xmath154 ( the distance between two neighboring fields is choosen to be @xmath153 , see appendix a for a discussion about the decorrelation properties of two neighboring fields ) , and the number densities of foreground and background galaxies are the same as above ( @xmath155 and @xmath102 ) .",
    "we see that a variation of the bias of more than @xmath156 over the scale interval @xmath157 $ ] is detectable , but if the foreground galaxies are located around @xmath158 , the error bars are larger , which is a consequence of the lower signal - to - noise in that case ( see the upper left plot in figure [ plot_s_n_nl.ps ] ) .",
    "a complete calculation of the cosmic variance of @xmath2 remains to be done , but the order of magnitude of the signal - to - noise calculated here shows the feasability of the measurement of the scale dependence of the bias parameter from surveys of a few ten square degrees size .",
    "the cross - correlation between the aperture mass and number counts for a wide range of scales @xmath131 $ ] , and for different cosmological models has been calculated .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum has been taken into account .",
    "it was found that the signal is dominated by this non - linear clustering . at scales larger than about @xmath159 ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per field is @xmath160 , close to the corresponding value calculated with the linear power spectrum . at small scales ,",
    "the signal - to - noise per field decreases to @xmath161 at @xmath4 , while it is close to zero for the linear power spectrum .",
    "moreover , a significant additional decrease of the signal - to - noise has been found when the foreground galaxies are located at very low redshift ( @xmath162 ) .    the second part of this paper is focussed on the measurement of the scale dependence of the bias , in the light of the previous results . it has been shown that the quantity @xmath1 , ( where @xmath0 is defined as the cross - correlation of the aperture mass - number counts divided by the dispersion of the number counts ) , is almost independent of scale .",
    "the reason for this is that the narrow filter applied in fourier space and the assumed narrow redshift distribution of the foreground galaxies reduce considerably the range of integration over the scales and the redshifts in eq .",

    "@xmath0 is thus a direct measure of the bias times a function which involves the cosmological parameters , and the redshift distributions of the foreground and background galaxies .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 , which is the ratio of @xmath0 at two different scales is only bias dependent ; it is a measure of the ratio of the bias at these two different scales . even for a general cosmological model , @xmath2 remains almost independent of the power spectrum ( because @xmath0 is also independent of it ) , the cosmological parameters , the redshift distribution of the foreground and background galaxies , if the bias parameter is independent of scale .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath2 may be used to measure a pure scale dependence of the bias , and the expected signal - to - noise ratio for a survey of @xmath3 square degrees size has been calculated .",
    "a variation of the bias of more than 20% over the scale range @xmath157 $ ] is detectable from this survey , provided that the variance @xmath163 of the number counts is well known ( from other surveys for instance ) . since the observer has the choice to select different redshift intervals for the foreground galaxies , it is in addition possible to detect a possible redshift dependence of the variation of the bias with scale .",
    "the method presented here allows a measure of a variation of the bias with scale if it is larger than 2% between @xmath4 and @xmath164 . below this limit",
    ", some residual couplings between the cosmology , the power spectrum , and the redshift distributions of the galaxies produce some variations in the curve @xmath165 .",

    "in this appendix , the standard deviation of @xmath2 is derived in the limit of small correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath170 , this gives the signal - to - noise of the estimator @xmath2 .",

    "if a number @xmath139 of fields of size @xmath16 are observed , the estimated value of @xmath0 is ,      the tilde quantities always refers to the estimator of this quantity .",
    "the observable @xmath173_i$ ] is introduced .",
    "it is assumed that its signal - to - noise is simply @xmath174 , where @xmath96 is the signal - to - noise of @xmath175 in one field of size @xmath16 ( see eq.([s_n_def ] ) ) .",
    "this assumption implicitly neglect the correlation between two neighboring fields , in other words , terms like @xmath176_i\\left[\\tilde m_{\\rm ap}(\\theta_{\\rm c})\\tilde   {",
    "\\cal n } ( \\theta_{\\rm c})\\right]_{j\\ne i}\\rangle$ ] are neglected .",
    "this point is discussed at the end of this appendix .",
    "thus it is possible to express @xmath177 as a function of the ensemble average @xmath178 , and a random variable @xmath179 ,            we want to calculate the dispersion @xmath187 .",
    "as explained in section 4 , the dispersion of the measurement of @xmath188 is neglected , this is why ensemble average values @xmath189 comes directly in ( [ r_estim_def ] ) .",
    "provided that the number of fields is large , @xmath147 , the dispersion @xmath190 is small compare to @xmath132 , thus the calculation of @xmath191 may be restricted to the second order in @xmath179 .",
    "in addition , neglecting the cross - correlation terms like @xmath192 ( this is discussed at the end of this appendix ) , the dispersion of @xmath185 is given by ,              and the signal - to - noise of @xmath2 is @xmath196 .",
    "the derivation of ( [ calc_err_r ] ) implies some simplifications mentioned above , which have to be discussed . from a practical point of view , the @xmath139 fields should be extracted from one large survey ( or at least , the largest scale of interest should be the smallest scale of a sub - field from a fragmented survey ) .",
    "thus we expect that two neighboring fields are correlated and that two fields centered on the same position but with two different smoothing scales are also correlated .",
    "it has been shown in svwjk ( figure 8) that the use of compensated filters allows to neglect these correlations ; the aperture mass @xmath37 of two neighboring fields of radius @xmath16 with a separation @xmath16 between the two centers are decorrelated by a factor of 10 , and more than a factor 100 if the separation is @xmath197 .",
    "the aperture mass of two coincide fields with a factor of 5 between the two smoothing scales are also decorrelated by a factor of 10 .",
    "moreover , if these two fields are off - centered ( which can be done in practice ) , the decorrelation is stronger .",
    "for example , two fields with a scale ratio of 2 are decorelated by a factor larger than 10 if they are off - centered by only half of the radius of the largest field .",
    "these decorrelation properties , direct consequences of the use of compensated filters , justify the assumptions made above to derive ( [ calc_err_r ] ) ."
