    "uusally analysts recommend investment strategies based e.g. on `` moving averages '' , `` momentum indicators '' , and the like techniques.@xcite as soon as econophysicists discovered scaling laws in financial data , it was of interest to search for some predictive value from the laws through some extrapolated evolution .",
    "e.g. a technique known as _ detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( dfa ) which measures the deviation of correlated fluctuations from a trend was developed into a strategy known as the @xmath2 ( or better @xmath3 ) dfa in order to predict fluctuations in the exchange rates of various currencies , gold price and other financial indices .",
    "@xcite the statistical analysis of data was based on the value of the exponent of the so found scaling law , itself related to the fractal dimension of the signal , or also to the hurst exponent of the so called rescaled range analysis .",
    "mathematical extensions , so called @xmath4 dfa and multifractals , can be found in the literature , though optimization problems and predictions on the future of fluctuations are apparently not so evident from these methods . a drawback in the dfa is found in the fact that it rather looks at correlations in the sign of fluctuations rather than at correlations in their amplitude .",
    "another sort of data analysis technique is known as the zipf technique,@xcite originating in work exploring the statistical nature of languages .",
    "the zipf analysis technique has also been used outside linguistic , financial and economic fields.@xcite the technique is based on a _ zipf plot _ which expresses the relationship between the frequency of words ( more generally , events ) and the rank order of such words ( or events ) on a log - log diagram ; a @xmath5 histogram can be drawn as well .",
    "the slope of the best linear fit on such a plot corresponds to an exponent @xmath6 describing the frequency @xmath7 of the ( @xmath5 ) occurrence of the words ( or events ) according to their rank @xmath8 through , e.g. @xmath9 .",
    "there are many instances in which financial and other economic data can be described through a log - log ( zipf ) plot : e.g. , the distribution of income ( pareto distribution ) @xcite , the size of companies @xcite , sociology @xcite , sometimes after translating the financial data into a text @xcite .",
    "thus it seems of interest to check whether such a technique can have some predictive value in finance .",
    "the present report is in line with such previous investigations .",
    "we present results based on considerations that financial data series are similar to fractional brownian motion - like time series , and usually biased.@xcite we examine whether a time dependent zipf law and exponent exist and can be used in order to implement simple investment strategies .    first , it is thus necessary to translate the financial data into a @xmath10 , based on an alphabet with @xmath11 characters and search for word s of length @xmath12 .",
    "there are obviously @xmath13 possible words .",
    "they can be ranked according to their frequency on a log(frequency)-log(rank ) diagram .",
    "a linear fit leads to consider the relationship as a power law .",
    "moreover , in the spirit of the local dfa , a local ( or  time ",
    "dependent ) zipf law or exponent can be introduced.@xcite in this latter reference , we have also considered the effect of a linear trend on the value of the zipf exponent .    .",
    "typical financial indices characteristics between jan . 01 , 1997 and dec . 31 , 2001 : hurst exponent @xmath14 ,",
    "( 5,2)-zipf exponent , bias ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , linear trend slope [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab 2.2 ]    results are reported when windows ( boxes ) of size @xmath18500 respectively are moved along the signal .",
    "this value corresponds to a 2 year type investment window . notice that the @xmath2 exponents are usually larger than the average one , due to finite size effects .    in the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) strategy",
    ", we consider that if @xmath21 , a `` buy order '' is given .",
    "a  sell order  is given for @xmath22 .",
    "no order is given when both probabilities are equal .",
    "results reported in table 2 pertain to @xmath12= 3 , 5 , and 7 at the end of the 5 year interval . in the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) strategy",
    "the local linear trend is subtracted before calculating @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the time dependent returns for @xmath20 and @xmath24 in the case @xmath12=3 , 5 , and 7 , and for @xmath11=2 are given in fig .",
    "2 for the seven hereby considered financial indices . a return @xmath27 ( given in @xmath28 )",

    "it appears ( table 2 ) that there is no immediate simple and general rule or universal optimum strategy .",
    "the latter depends on the volatility , i.e. the signal roughness and the local ( @xmath36)-zipf exponent value . from the implemented simple strategies",
    ", it occurs that `` the best returns '' are usually for @xmath20 with @xmath12 = 5 , except for nasdaq for which a fine result arises from a @xmath20 with @xmath12 = 7 , ( or @xmath24 and @xmath12=5 ) and for the ftse , with either @xmath20 or @xmath24 and @xmath12=7 .",
    "this choice of the @xmath12 value and the @xmath20 strategy is conjectured to be good for large @xmath37 and `` non brownian '' ( large @xmath14 ) cases .",
    "however for quasi - brownian signals ( and high / low @xmath38 ) , then it is obvious that one has reduced losses for the nikkei when one chooses a @xmath20 strategy with @xmath12=7 ; this is a very large @xmath38 case .",
    "this is rather similar to the ftse case .",
    "increased gains are found for @xmath39 with @xmath20 and @xmath12=7 , and for djia with @xmath20 and @xmath12=5 , i.e. when @xmath38 is close to 0.1 . on the contrary for",
    "the @xmath40 a @xmath24 and @xmath41 strategy should be better , i.e. for @xmath42 0.1 .",
    "the situation is rather neutral for the dax , the choice @xmath20 , @xmath12=5 being favored .",
    "many other cases could be further considered , and theoretical work suggested : first one could wonder about signal stationarity .",
    "next either a non linear ( thus like a power law ) trend or a periodic background could be subtracted from the raw signal , and the zipf exponent time variation examined .",
    "many other strategies are also available .    in summary , we have translated seven financial index signals each into a text based of two letters @xmath43 and @xmath44 , according to the fluctuations as in a corresponding random walk .",
    "we have calculated the zipf exponent(s ) giving the relationship between the frequency of occurrence of words of length @xmath45 made of such  letters  for a binary alphabet .",
    "we have introduced considerations based on the notion of a local ( or  time ",
    "dependent ) zipf law ( and exponent ) .",
    "we have imagined two simple investment strategies taking into account the linear trend of the biased signal or not , and have reported the time dependence of the returns .",
