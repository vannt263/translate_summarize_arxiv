    "much attention has been paid in the last twenty years to low frequency dynamics of dna due to its relevance to biological processes .",
    "vibrational modes involving collective motions of groups of atoms have been experimentally investigated by means of various techniques as neutron scattering  @xcite , spectroscopy measurements  @xcite , nmr ,  ... among the latters , raman studies carried out by h.  urabe  _ et al._@xcite have revealed particulary useful to gain information on the dependence of low frequency vibrations properties of dna upon external conditions e.g. water content , ionic concentration , temperature .",
    "the observation of the raman scattering intensity in the low frequency region is technically very difficult because the strong solvent rayleigh scattering near zero frequency masks the dna response .",
    "nevertheless a broad band ranging from 60 @xmath5 to @xmath8  @xmath5 has been evidenced and associated to hydrogen bonded base pair vibrations  @xcite .",
    "moreover experiments focusing on oriented solid dna fibers have also exhibit sharp peaks in the raman intensity at @xmath9  16  @xmath5 , that shifts toward lower frequency region when rising the degree of hydration  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this peak is far from being obvious .",
    "in particular , its interhelical or intrahelical origine has been debated for a long time  @xcite .    to reach a better understanding of the above experimental findings , detailed theoretical analysis of dna vibrational motions",
    "have been proposed .",
    "devoting a particular attention to hydrogen bond stretching modes , prohofsky and his collaborators  @xcite have been able to find back a vibration mode at 85  @xmath5 and confirm its origin .",
    "their approach is based on a detailed description of the dna molecule at the atomic level  @xcite and a variational calculation method , called modified self - consistent phonon approximation ( mspa ) . within mspa",
    ", the molecule at ambient temperature is reduced to an effective ( and complex ) harmonic lattice the force constants of which are determined in a self - consistent way .",
    "this approach has been very useful in calculating many properties of dna , e.g. the melting of dna s of different sequences @xcite,@xcite , the temperature and salt dependence of the b to z conformation change @xcite and the stability of drug - dna complex @xcite .    a qualitative weakness of mspa , that also arises in other simplified theoretical approaches  @xcite lies in the _ a priori _ nature of modes .",
    "though effective elastic constants depends on temperature , normal modes indeed conserve a plane wave structure  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "dispersion relations for the normal modes are well defined as for phonons in crystals  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the coherence length is infinite and the momentum selection rule give rise to a discrete set of lines in the theoretical predictions for raman spectra@xcite . on the contrary , amorphous materials or more generally thermally disordered systems give rise to normal modes with short coherence lengths , whose power spectrum displays a finite width  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "momentum selection rules break down and light scattering processes may occur from essentially all normal modes  @xcite . correspondingly for a dna molecule in solution , the raman spectrum is continuous and does not depend on the wave length of the incident laser beam nor on the scattering angle  @xcite .    understanding the vibrations of a system in presence of thermal ( or configurational ) disorder is a difficult task  @xcite .",
    "non - harmonicities in the interactions between constituents may modify deeply the usual phonon picture of wave propagation in solids and generally forbid any rigorous analytical treatment of the dynamical equations . an interesting approach to circumvent",
    "this difficulty has been proposed in the context of liquid state dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to start from a randomly chosen configuration at thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "then , the equations of motion around this fixed initial configuration can be linearized , defining some instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) and their corresponding relaxation times _ i.e. _ frequencies .",
    "all these quantities may then be averaged over the initial configuration chosen from the gibbs ensemble at the desired temperature .",
    "one obtains this way a precise description of the short times dynamics based on the average spectrum of relaxation times and the statistical properties of the inm  @xcite . as a major advantage",
    ", the inm approach takes into account thermal disorder through the choice of the random initial configuration and gives rise to highly disordered normal modes with finite autocorrelation length as expected at finite temperature . due to the linearization procedure",
    ", the information available through inm calculations is restricted to short times dynamics .",
    "this limitation is however not serious in the range of frequencies mentioned above for dna collective dynamics as we shall see later .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the calculation of the inm around a fixed intial configuration is a hard task that can be performed analytically for simple enough models only@xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the torsional and hydrogen bond stretching vibrations of a very simple dna model by normal modes that are not plane waves using the inm approach .",
    "we are able in particular to calculate the frequency dependent density of state at a given temperature , the coherence length of the normal modes and some pseudo dispersion relations at ambient temperature .",
    "the model that we consider has been introduced in a previous article to study the dna denaturation driven by temperature or mechanically induced by a torque  @xcite .",
    "this study was motivated by the recent development of micromanipulation techniques@xcite that have allowed the direct observation of dna denaturation induced by an external torsional stress  @xcite .",
    "our model describes the dna molecule at the base pair level , and for each base pair we have just two degrees of freedom that is the base pair radius and twist angle . as a result , the potential energy is sufficiently simple to allow for sophisticated analytical calculations of normal collective modes . from a technical point of view , our calculation is inspired from a recent study of instantaneous modes in an one dimensional disordered system  @xcite , that mixes techniques used in localization theory ( the resolvent calculation ) , disordered system ( replica trick)@xcite and a variational gaussian wave function method .",
    "as we shall see , the interest of the calculation is two - fold .",
    "first , it gives theoretical predictions for the spectrum of modes , the effective dispersion relations and damping width at ambient temperature that can be directly confronted with raman spectroscopy and to neutron scattering data .",
    "secondly , it is a way to check the validity of ( and eventually improve ) our model in very different experimental conditions from the the ones it was originally designed for .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we define the dna model and explain how to compute its statistical physics properties . the choice of the force constants and the main thermodynamical features are then exposed .",
    "section  iii is devoted to dynamics and to the definiton of the instantaneous modes .",
    "the relationship between the latters and raman spectra is evoked .",
    "the analytical framework necessary to calculation the properties of inm is presented in section  iv .",
    "results are given and compared to experiments in section  v. finally , we present some conclusions and perspectives in section  vi .",
    "in this section , we describe the dna model under study and briefly recall how it can be studied using statistical mechanics techniques as well as its main thermodynamical features , see @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the properties of the normal modes , e.g. dispersion relations , spectral density , ... of the molecule in the absence of temperature and interaction with the solvent .",

    "close to zero frequency , the density of states vanishes as @xmath354 since the density of eigenvalues @xmath355 is finite in @xmath356 , see ( [ ris ] ) .",

    "indeed , the coherence length of the disordered phonons is of the order of @xmath383 and is negligible with respect to optical wavelengths @xmath384 , see section  iii.c .",
    "both radial and angular spectra are superposed in figure  11 .",

    "while for @xmath81 , torsional and radial spectra do not intersect each other , there is an overlap region at smaller stiffness constant around @xmath390  @xmath5 . nevertheless , both fluctuations take place on basically two distinct scale times .",

    "the latter measurement was performed on calf thymus in solution ( 10 mm phb , ph=7 ) .",
    "this allows us to think that @xmath319 is a better choice for the stiffness constant than @xmath321  @xcite .",

    "our calculation predicts , despite the presence of unstable inm and the absence of friction terms in the dynamical equations ( [ eqm ] ) that angular modes are predominant for @xmath6@xmath5 . at such low frequencies ,",
    "radial modes can be neglected and twist fluctuations are responsible for collective vibrations of interplane distances @xmath421 . in agreement with experiments , our calculation thus predicts that low frequency modes ( @xmath6@xmath5 ) are related to vibrations of the base pairs column .",

    "neutron scattering measurements have shown that pseudo - dispersion relations with a finite damping width can be obtained for low frequencies but these experiments have been performed on crystalline dna fibers .",
    "our model ( and the values of parameters exposed section  ii.c ) are valid for dna in solution where the interaction with surrounding water is radically different and interhelical effects are absent .",
    "more precisely , we find that at fixed momentum @xmath0 , the experimental frequency @xmath125 for fibers is larger than the theoretical predictions for diluted dna . the additional mass due to primary water shells for dna in solution may account for the reduction of frequency to a large extent  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the extrapolated value of @xmath220 is constant and equal to 0.48 in good agreement with the theoretical minimum @xmath422 shown fig .",
    "in this article , we have shown how to apply the inm framework to a simple model of dna molecule and reproduce the main features of collective vibration modes at finite temperature .",
