    "many years ago sandage & wildey ( 1967 ) and van den bergh ( 1967 ) discovered that the horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphology in the galactic globular clusters ( gc s ) does not correlate tightly with the cluster metallicity . while theory and observation agree that the hb morphology on average becomes redder with increasing metallicity , there are many examples of gc s having very similar metallicities but markedly different hb morphologies , e.g. , m3 versus m13 , ngc  362 versus ngc  288 .",
    "thus some parameter besides metallicity must be affecting the evolution of the hb stars in these clusters . indeed ,",
    "theoretical hb models show that there are many possible ",
    "second parameter \" candidates , e.g. , the gc age , mass loss along the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , helium abundance @xmath1 , alpha - element enhancement [ @xmath2/fe ] , and rotation ( fusi pecci & bellazzini 1998 ) .",
    "recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) observations have revealed that the metal - rich gc s ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 contain a significant population of blue hb ( bhb ) stars and therefore exhibit a pronounced second - parameter effect ( piotto et al .",
    "1997 ; rich et al .",
    "1997 ) . from their analysis , rich et al .",
    "concluded that neither a greater age nor enhanced rgb mass loss due to dynamical effects could satisfactorily account for the bhb populations in these gc s .",
    "understanding the origin of these bhb stars has important implications for determining the formation history of the galaxy and for interpreting the integrated spectra of the old metal - rich stellar populations in elliptical galaxies .",
    "if , for example , age were the second parameter in these gc s , then ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 would be among the oldest , if not the oldest , gc s in the galaxy .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) pointed out that the hb s of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 have a pronounced upward slope with decreasing @xmath0 , with the mean luminosity at the top of the blue tail being nearly 0.5  mag brighter in @xmath3 than the well - populated red hb ( rhb ) clump .",
    "a similar upward slope is also present in the rhb itself ( piotto et al .",
    "as we shall see , such upward sloping hb s can not be explained within the framework of canonical theory .",
    "more specifically , they can not be attributed to differences in age or rgb mass loss  the two most prominent second - parameter candidates .",
    "we emphasize therefore that these gc s may provide a crucial clue for understanding the second - parameter effect .    in this _",
    "letter _ we will investigate the following non - canonical scenarios for explaining the bhb populations and , in particular , the sloped hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 :    1 .",
    "_ high @xmath1 scenario _ , where a high helium abundance at the time of gc formation leads to unusually long blue loops during the hb evolution ; 2 .",
    "_ rotation scenario _",
    ", where internal rotation increases the hb core mass , making the hb both bluer and brighter ; 3 .   _",
    "helium - mixing scenario _ , where deep mixing along the rgb increases the hb envelope helium abundance , also leading to bluer and brighter hb stars .",
    "we will explore each of these possibilities under the simplest possible assumptions and will show that each can produce sloped hb s resembling those in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "we begin in sec .  2 by discussing the failure of the canonical models to explain the observed hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ; in sec .  3 , we describe each of the above non - canonical scenarios in more detail ; in sec .  4 , we show that the rr lyraes in ngc  6388 are brighter than field variables of similar [ fe / h ] , in agreement with these scenarios . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we suggest some observational tests to discriminate among these scenarios .",
    "in order to explore the hb morphology predicted by canonical models for ngc  6388 and ngc 6441 , we have constructed a grid of hb sequences with a main - sequence helium abundance @xmath4 and a scaled - solar heavy - element abundance @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath6 } = -0.5 $ ] ) , using the stellar evolution code described by sweigart ( 1997 ) . adopting the kurucz ( 1992 ) color - temperature transformations and bolometric corrections , we first computed an hb simulation with the mean mass @xmath7 for the gaussian mass distribution and the mass dispersion @xmath8 chosen to give a well - populated red and blue hb .",
    "this canonical simulation , shown in fig .  1 , predicts a completely flat hb morphology , unlike the observed hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 . in order to explore any dependence on metallicity",
    ", we also carried out extensive model computations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , again failing to find any evidence for sloped hb s .    the hb simulation in fig .",
    "1 indicates that the bhb population in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 does not arise from either an older cluster age or greater rgb mass loss .",
    "while increasing the assumed age or rgb mass loss would move an rhb star blueward , it would not increase its luminosity .",
    "we conclude therefore that canonical theory does not provide a straightforward explanation for the observed hb morphology in these gc s .",
    "we have also investigated whether the slope of the rhb in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 could be due to differential reddening , as has been claimed for several metal - rich gc s ( e.g. , ngc  6539 : armandroff 1988 ; pal  10 : kaisler , harris , & maclaughlin 1997 ; ngc  6553 : guarnieri et al .",
    "extensive hb simulations show that the differential reddening @xmath12 would have to considerably exceed the amounts estimated by piotto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in order to transform , say , a 47  tuc - like rhb into the sloped hb s found in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "moreover , the hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are sloped in each of the four wfpc2 chips , which would not be expected if differential reddening were the cause of the sloped rhb s in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) of these gc s .    finally , we point out that inaccuracies in the transformation from the wfpc2 filter system to the  standard \" johnson - cousins system are also unlikely to cause the sloped hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , since the instrumental cmd s clearly show sloped hb s ( dorman 1998 , priv . comm . ) .",
    "if the filter transformation were responsible , one would expect sloped hb s in the hst cmd s for other gc s ( e.g. , 47  tuc and ngc  2808 ) from piotto et al . ( 1997 ) and sosin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which is not the case .",
    "the failure of canonical models to explain the observed hb morphology in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 suggests that some non - canonical process may be operating in these metal - rich gc s . in this section",
    ", we will therefore discuss three non - canonical scenarios for producing sloped hb s , beginning with the possibility of a high cluster helium abundance .",
    "rhb stars evolve along blue loops during most of their hb lifetime .",
    "normally these loops cover only a small range in @xmath0 . for larger helium abundances ,",
    "however , these blue loops can become considerably longer , reaching higher effective temperatures and deviating more in luminosity from the zero - age hb ( zahb ) ( sweigart & gross 1976 ) .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively , one would expect the hb for a sufficiently high @xmath1 to slope upward with decreasing @xmath0 ( catelan & de freitas pacheco 1996 ) .    to test this possibility ,",
    "we have constructed a grid of @xmath13 hb sequences for @xmath4 , 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.38 and 0.43 and @xmath9 , 0.006 and 0.01716 .",
    "for each ( @xmath14 ) combination we first evolved a star up the rgb without mass loss and then through the helium flash to obtain a zahb model at the red end of the hb .",
    "lower mass zahb models were then obtained by removing mass from the envelope of this high mass zahb model .",
    "not surprisingly , the hb simulations for @xmath4 , 0.28 and 0.33 did not show a significant slope .",
    "however , when @xmath15 was increased to 0.38 and 0.43 , a pronounced hb slope close to that in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 was found , as illustrated in figs .",
    "2a , b , respectively .",
    "there is also a hint of bimodality , as seen in the observed cmd s ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ) . in these simulations",
    "we did not try to reproduce the ratio of blue to red hb stars .",
    "this ratio depends on the choice of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , assumed here to be @xmath16 .",
    "the hb s predicted by this high @xmath1 scenario are quite bright , implying a large pulsation period for the rr lyrae variables and a large value for the number ratio @xmath17 of hb stars to rgb stars brighter than the mean rr lyrae luminosity ( iben 1968 ) .",
    "in addition , this scenario would imply a peculiar chemical enrichment history for ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , characterized by a very large enrichment law @xmath18 ( cf .",
    "shi 1995 ; schramm 1997 ) .",
    "since the work of mengel & gross ( 1976 ) it has been known that rotation during the rgb phase can delay the helium flash . as reviewed by renzini ( 1977 )",
    ", this would have two consequences for the subsequent hb evolution .",
    "first , it would increase the helium - core mass @xmath19 and hence the hb luminosity .",
    "second , it would lead to enhanced mass loss near the tip of the rgb and thus to a smaller hb envelope mass .",
    "the net effect would be a shift in the hb location towards higher effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively , one might also expect a range in rotation to produce an upward sloping hb .",
    "could this be the explanation for the sloped hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ?    to answer this question , one needs to know how much extra mass is lost at the tip of the rgb when @xmath19 exceeds its canonical value .",
    "we determined this by evolving a number of sequences up the rgb for various values of the reimers mass loss parameter @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "reimers 1975 ; fusi pecci & renzini 1976 ) . in these sequences",
    "we turned off all helium burning , thereby permitting @xmath19 to exceed its canonical value without igniting the helium flash . using these sequences",
    ", we were able to determine how the final mass @xmath21 decreases with increasing @xmath19 for each value of @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath22 relations defined in this manner were then used to compute grids of hb sequences for @xmath23 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "two simulations for this rotation scenario are shown in fig .  2 for @xmath24 ( panel c ) and 0.4 ( panel d ) .",
    "the red end of the hb in these simulations is populated by canonical models without rotation .",
    "the masses of these canonical models were used as the mean mass @xmath7 for defining the mass range @xmath25 covered by these simulations .",
    "thus the blueward extension of the hb in figs .",
    "2c , d is driven solely by the increase in @xmath19 and corresponding decrease in @xmath21 . in both figs .",
    "2c , d the hb slopes upward , especially in the @xmath24 case .",
    "note , however , that the increase in @xmath19 for the bluer hb stars is very large ( @xmath26 ) , which , in turn , would require a very high main - sequence rotation rate .",
    "the observed abundance variations in gc red - giant stars indicate that these stars are able to mix nuclearly processed material from the vicinity of the hydrogen shell out to the surface , presumably as a result of internal rotation ( kraft 1994 ) . in particular , the observed variations in aluminum require the mixing to penetrate into the hydrogen shell ( langer & hoffman 1995 ; cavallo , sweigart , & bell 1998 ) .",
    "thus any mixing process which dredges up aluminum will also dredge up helium . besides increasing the envelope helium abundance @xmath27",
    "such mixing would also increase the rgb tip luminosity and thus the amount of mass loss .",
    "consequently a red - giant star which undergoes such helium mixing will arrive on the hb with both a higher @xmath27 and a lower mass and hence will be both hotter and brighter than the corresponding canonical star ( sweigart 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests , at least qualitatively , that helium mixing might also lead to a sloped hb morphology .    to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have evolved a set of @xmath28 sequences up the rgb and through the helium flash and hb phases for various amounts of helium mixing .",
    "two cases were considered , namely , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where the mass in each case corresponds to an age of 13  gyr at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the @xmath20 values used in these sequences were 0.4 , 0.5 and 0.6 .",
    "two of the helium - mixing simulations for @xmath4 are presented in figs .  2e , f .",
    "each of these simulations covers the mass range @xmath25 , where @xmath7 was taken to be the mass of a canonical model without helium mixing . as the helium mixing increases",
    ", the hb tracks shift blueward , giving rise to the pronounced upward slope evident in figs .",
    "2e , f . in fact ,",
    "the hb slope in fig .",
    "2e slightly exceeds the observed slope in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "there is , moreover , a hint of bimodality in this simulation .",
    "the helium abundance @xmath27 near the instability strip in fig .",
    "2e is @xmath31 .",
    "we have compared the predictions of the above simulations in the period - temperature diagram with the two known rrab lyrae variables in ngc  6388 ( silbermann et al .",
    "temperatures were determined as in catelan , sweigart , & borissova ( 1998 ; see also catelan 1998 ) .",
    "the result of one such comparison is given in fig .  3 , where we also plot field variables of similar metallicity as well as v9 in 47  tuc ( storm et al .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values for the field variables are from layden ( 1994 ) ; amplitudes and periods are taken from blanco ( 1992 ) , but in some cases from sandage ( 1990 ) .",
    "blazhko variables were avoided .",
    "as one can clearly see , the variables in ngc  6388 and 47  tuc have considerably longer periods and thus substantially higher luminosities than field stars of comparable metallicity .",
    "moreover , the cluster variables seem to agree well with the displayed simulation , which in this case was taken from fig .",
    "the results in this _ letter _ demonstrate that canonical models fail to explain the sloped hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "this has the important implication that , at least for these gc s , the two most prominent second - parameter candidates  age and rgb mass loss  cannot account for the observed hb morphology .",
    "simulations employing non - canonical models show that an increased initial gc helium abundance or a dispersion in the stellar rotational velocity ( leading to a range in @xmath19 or @xmath27 ) may account for the observed hb morphology in these two gc s . finally ,",
    "we find that the rr lyrae variables in ngc  6388 and 47  tuc are substantially brighter than field variables of comparable [ fe / h]in agreement with the non - canonical scenarios .      1 .   _ analysis of r - ratios _ : the @xmath17 ratios differ widely from one non - canonical scenario to the next , being largest for the high-@xmath1 case ( figs .",

    "in addition , we suggest a study of the rr lyraes in the metal - rich gc s ngc  6304 ( hartwick , barlow , & hesser 1981 ; layden 1995 ) and ngc  6652 ( ortolani , bica , & barbuy 1994 ) ; 4 .   _ surface gravities of blue hb stars _ : @xmath34 measurements could discriminate among the different origins of the bhb stars in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( crocker , rood , & oconnell 1988 ) and provide a strong constraint on whether the hb s are indeed brighter than predicted by the canonical models ; 5 .",
