    "we consider a joint system consisting of three parts : the principal system @xmath1 , its surrounding system ( environment ) @xmath2 , and an ancillary system @xmath5 , whose hilbert spaces are denoted as @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the entire system @xmath24 on @xmath109 is a non - dissipative closed system .",
    "the principal system @xmath1 interacts with its environment @xmath2 via hamiltonian @xmath0 , while @xmath2 does not interact directly with the ancillary system @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the joint system can be written as @xmath110 .",
    "we are not allowed to access the environmental system @xmath2 directly , which means that no part of @xmath2 can be a subject of direct control or measurement .",
    "meanwhile , we are able to perform any quantum operations and measurements on the joint system @xmath45 instantaneously .",
    "a key assumption we make is that the environmental system @xmath2 is finite - dimensional , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "those systems under our control , @xmath5 and @xmath1 are also finite - dimensional , and naturally @xmath112 and @xmath113 are always known .",
    "we do not assume any prior knowledge of @xmath3 , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 , and the state on @xmath114 .",
    "for most of the discussion in this supplementary information ( si ) , @xmath115 refers to the dimension of @xmath5 after the state - steering protocol ( see the main text and sec [ sec state steering ] in si ) has been completed , unless stated otherwise .    under these settings ,",
    "our goal is to obtain as much information as possible about @xmath2 and the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , namely , @xmath107 , @xmath0 , and the state on @xmath116 .",
    "a central tool for the information acquisition is quantum state tomography @xcite of the joint system @xmath45 to determine @xmath31 as a function of time .",
    "hence , we assume that it is possible to prepare an identical , but not necessarily known , initial state @xmath65 on the whole system @xmath116 as many times as necessary .",
    "pragmatically , such a state initialisation can be achieved by waiting for the equilibration of the state , which is caused by the interaction with a larger environmental system that surrounds @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the timescale for such an equilibration is much longer than the one within which the entire system of @xmath24 can be considered closed .",
    "the initial time @xmath117 is defined as the time when the state initialisation is completed .",
    "since we have prior information about @xmath115 and @xmath13 , our system dynamics can be characterised by @xmath3 , a state on @xmath116 at the time @xmath117 , and the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "note that at @xmath117 , we can always assume the initial state on @xmath116 is pure .",
    "this is because when the state on @xmath116 is mixed , we can append an extra hilbert space @xmath118 to the system so that the state on @xmath119 is pure @xcite .",
    "then , we simply redefine @xmath120 as @xmath107 , and @xmath121 as a new hamiltonian @xmath0 to restart the whole discussion .",
    "therefore , we need a set of three elements @xmath64 , which we shall call a _ triple _ , to characterise the behaviour of our system under the effect of environment between the times @xmath117 and @xmath122 @xmath123 .",
    "although we choose @xmath124 , which is theoretically natural , since we practically perform an experiment within a finite time length , the consideration of a finite @xmath122 is also useful as we will see later .      as mentioned above , our primary goal is to identify the triple @xmath64 .",
    "yet , it appears to be a formidable , if not impossible , task to completely specify the triple when our access is limited to only @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "what if there are more than one possible triple ? in the context of system identification , the problem of indistinguishable system models for a given experimental data set has been studied in the classical setting for a long time @xcite and also recently discussed in quantum scenario , in which the entire system is known to be controllable @xcite . similarly to these cases , for our task of identifying the system @xmath2 , it turns out that even if there were multiple possibilities of triples that give rise to the same dynamical behaviour on @xmath45 , the differences between them would not lead to distinct outcomes of quantum control @xcite of @xmath2 through @xmath1 . in other words , if there were two indistinguishable environmental systems characterised by @xmath64 and @xmath125 in the time period @xmath126 , the results of any quantum computation that utilises @xmath2 as a resource would be independent of whether the _ true _ environment was either of them .",
    "therefore , for the acquisition of information on the environmental system @xmath107 towards the exploitation of @xmath2 as a ( partial ) resource for quantum computing , it suffices to determine the equivalence class on the set of all triples through all possible sequences of quantum operations on @xmath127 .    before giving a rigorous definition of the equivalence class of triples ,",
    "let us first specify all operations we can apply on the system .",
    "first , we do not consider operations that are applied continuously in time .",
    "thus , what we consider to be applicable is a sequence of instantaneous quantum operations @xcite , @xmath128 at time @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 for all @xmath132 .",
    "second , a quantum operation @xmath133 can be non - deterministic , i.e. , trace non - increasing , because we can always post - select the measurement results .",
    "third , we are allowed to append and remove finite - dimensional ancillary systems , which means that @xmath133 is a quantum operation on @xmath134 to @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is a linear space of all ( bounded ) linear operators on @xmath137 , @xmath138 in general , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .",
    "hence , our definition of the equivalence class is as follows :    [ equiv_env ] * ( the equivalence between triples ) * a triple @xmath64 is said to be equivalent to another triple , @xmath141 , in @xmath126 , if they satisfy @xmath142 for all @xmath143 and all sequences of completely positive trace non - increasing maps @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "each @xmath133 is a map from @xmath145 to @xmath146 and performed at time @xmath147 .",
    "we will denote the equivalence between triples as @xmath148 .    in eq .",
    "( [ a2 eq definition of equivalence ] ) , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are identity ( super)operators on @xmath108 and @xmath107 , respectively .",

    "@xmath153 is given as @xmath154 and @xmath155 is defined similarly with @xmath156 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "we can easily see that the relation  @xmath157 \" is reflective , symmetric , and transitive .",
    "thus , it is an equivalence relation in the mathematical sense @xcite , and a set of all the triples can be decomposed into equivalence classes accordingly .",
    "our definition of equivalence here differs from the one in @xcite in that ours includes the possibility of appending an arbitrarily large ancillary system . also , in def .",
    "[ equiv_env ] above , the controllability of the system of interest is not assumed .",
    "such a consideration is important especially when we can utilise the joint system @xmath4 as a part of a larger quantum network , rather than an isolated quantum computer .",
    "let us slightly simplify the definition of the above equivalence relation for the following discussion . here , we define a hilbert space @xmath50 that includes all @xmath158 as its subspace .",

    "we mean the evolution of the system without active operations on it , namely , the evolution that is driven only by the system hamiltonian , which is @xmath0 in our case . then , we prove that when the system satisfies the me condition , there exists an equivalent triple , in which @xmath2 which is maximally entangled @xcite with ( a subset of ) @xmath5 ( the subsection [ sec pme subsec pme is mes ] ) .",
    "we note that although our main focus is on a finite - dimensional @xmath107 in this paper , some of the theorems and lemmas in this section are valid even for infinite - dimensional @xmath107 , as long as @xmath115 and @xmath13 are finite .",
    "the condition for the equivalence of triples still appears quite complicated even in the form of lemma [ lemma sec problem settings ] . in this subsection",

    "<S> we have shown the possibility of probing a large surrounding quantum system ( environment ) through a small principal system despite the lack of direct accessibility , provided the environment is effectively finite - dimensional . by probing , we mean fully identifying the hamiltonian and utilising it as a useful resource for quantum control , e.g. , quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> this goes strongly against our intuitive supposition that environment is usually a villain with respect to the protection of quantum coherence and that the hamiltonian @xmath0 is not estimable . </S>",
    "<S> although our method might not be realisable in the lab straightaway , it opens up a path to the novel exploitation of the environment for quantum engineering . </S>"
