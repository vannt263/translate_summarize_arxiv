    "in this paper we summarize various observations suggesting that one of the neutrinos is consistent with being a tachyon as originally defined , i.e. , a particle with @xmath1 and @xmath2 that obeys relativistic kinematics,@xcite a possibility first raised by chodos , hauser and kostelecky.@xcite as is well known , time - of - flight measurements of neutrinos no longer show any indication of superluminality , but they do set useful upper limits at the gev energy scale.@xcite there is also the upper limit on @xmath3 at low energies ( around 20 mev ) set by sn 1987a , i.e. , @xmath4.@xcite as shown in the next section , however , there are reasons to disbelieve this much more stringent upper limit .",
    "the burst of 24 neutrinos seen in the kamioka,@xcite imb@xcite and baksan@xcite detectors , arrived about 3 hours before the light was recorded from sn 1987a .",
    "this early arrival was presumably due to the delay experienced by photons emitted from the collapsing sn core , which was not the case for the emitted neutrinos .",
    "however , the value of the photon delay need not have been the entire 3 h , therefore the early neutrino arrival is normally assumed to set only an upper limit on any excess above c for their speed , @xmath4 . here we show that one can not rule out a third superluminal mass eigenstate that arrived long before the other 24 neutrinos .",
    "this assertion , however , does not refer to the burst of 5 events observed in the lsd detector underneath mt .",
    "blanc,@xcite which occurred during a 7 s interval nearly 4 hours before the 24 event burst , as we can easily show .",
    "consider hypothetical superluminal neutrinos of some fixed @xmath6 and varying values for their energy @xmath7 that are assumed to have originated in a very brief burst .",
    "relativistic kinematics under the approximation that @xmath8 requires that the neutrino arrival time t can be expressed as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the light travel time from the supernova , and @xmath11 would be the arrival time of @xmath12 neutrinos  which as shown in reference 12 is probably equivalent ( within @xmath13 ) to setting @xmath14 for the earliest arriving neutrino in each detector for the 24 event burst . from eq .",
    "1 we therefore find that if @xmath6 is fixed that the spread in the neutrino arrival times will be related to the spread in their energies according to :    @xmath15    eq .",
    "2 implies that in order to be observed @xmath16 early within a burst as short as @xmath17 the superluminal neutrinos would have had to be monochromatic to one part in 5140  which is virtually inconceivable for neutrinos from an exploding supernova .",
    "turning the argument around , we can say that superluminal neutrinos with the energy spread seen for events in the three detectors , i.e. , @xmath18 would have arrival times spread over many hours and would certainly not be recognized as a pulse above background ( around 1 event in 8 seconds ) .",
    "whatever the source of the mt .",
    "blanc neutrinos , they could not have been due to brief superluminal burst emitted from sn 1987a .",
    "the inability to recognize a superluminal signal as a short pulse above background would be even less possible for larger excesses above light speed , where the spread in arrival times would be even larger .",
    "thus , the normally assumed upper limit @xmath4 from sn 1987a data is not correct , because any real superluminal signal would have gone unnoticed for large @xmath5 if one is expecting to see a pulse above background .",
    "the neutrinos from sn 1987a have been the subject of hundreds of papers , both theoretical and phenomenological.@xcite some of these papers analyze the data to infer an upper limit on the electron neutrino mass , which ranges typically from 12 to 16 @xmath19,@xcite although one 2010 analysis has claimed a 5.8 ev upper limit,@xcite and still more refined methods may allow future galactic supernova to achieve mass limits as low as 0.14 ev.@xcite in marked contrast to finding upper limits , a 2012 paper has claimed evidence for the presence of two ( non - superluminal ) mass eigenstates for the sn 1987 a neutrinos,@xcite following the method of earlier similar analyses by cowsik@xcite and huzita.@xcite the heavier mass eigenstate has @xmath20 , while the lighter one has @xmath21  similar to the values cited by cowsik in 1988,@xcite but with considerably smaller uncertainties .    before considering the implications of this result for a third superluminal state having @xmath22 and why such outlandishly heavy mass eigenstates need not conflict with well - established upper limits on neutrino masses , e.g. , from cosmology , a brief summary of the basis of the claim of 4.0 and 21.4 ev mass eigenstates is in order .",
    "the analysis is based on an observed correlation between recorded neutrino energies @xmath23 and arrival times @xmath24 for the @xmath25 events in the three detectors ( excluding the 5 events from the mt . blanc detector ) .",
    "if the neutrinos reaching earth were all emitted nearly simultaneously then based on eq . 1 on a plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath27 all those neutrinos having a mass @xmath28 will lie on a line of slope @xmath29 while those having a mass @xmath30 will lie on a line of slope @xmath31 fig .",
    "1 of reference 12 clearly shows that every one of the 24 neutrinos do lie on or near one of two straight lines , and the two fits have acceptable chi square .",
    "the fact that those two straight lines also nearly pass through the origin implies that the choice of @xmath11 for the first arriving neutrino in each detector made by each experiment nearly conforms to the definition of @xmath11 used in eq .",
    "it should also be noted that the claim of two mass eigenstates is not contradicted by the fact that all arriving neutrinos are detected only as ( anti)electron neutrinos , because it is only for mass not flavor eigenstates that all neutrinos having some specific energy e travel at some fixed mass - dependent speed .",
    "moreover , supernova neutrino data is unique in that no other time of flight measurement could possibly have the time resolution to observe separate mass eigenstates , since the distance to sn 1987a is approximately @xmath32 earth diameters .",
    "the main weakness of the claim of two mass eigenstates is that it rests on there being near - simultaneous supernova neutrino emissions ( within @xmath13 ) of most of the detected sn 1987a neutrinos .",
    "supernova core collapse models in fact do show that the burst of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos rises and falls by an order of magnitude in the first second,@xcite while some models show it lasting only about 0.02 seconds.@xcite alternatively , it is possible some of the neutrinos detected from sn 1987a were emitted over an extended period of time , but they had a strange correlation between their energy and emission time that mimicked two mass eigenstates on an plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath27 .",
    "one could conceivably accommodate this correlation within the framework of a composite model consisting of the sum of two thermal spectra.@xcite ultimately , however , there is no way to know precisely what fraction of the neutrinos emitted during a supernova core collapse are emitted in the first second . while supernova modeler thomas janka has suggested the number is likely to be no more than half,@xcite the fraction of the 24 @xmath33 neutrinos emitted during the first second could be considerably greater than half , given the softer spectra of later - emitted neutrinos.@xcite      in the remainder of this section we show that even though the two mass eigenstates claimed for sn 1987a are not superluminal their existence ( if confirmed ) would imply that there must be a third unobserved eigenstate that is superluminal in order to be compatible with cosmological upper limits on the sum of the masses of the three flavor states , i.e. , @xmath34@xcite and that of the electron neutrino mass , @xmath35 from tritium beta decay.@xcite    we can express the effective mass of the fth flavor state in terms of a sum over all the mass eigenstates @xmath36 as :    @xmath37    thus , in light of the large values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 , only if the 3rd mass eigenstate has @xmath38 could the three flavor eigenstates all be quite close to zero , having either @xmath39 or @xmath40 depending on the values of the @xmath41 .",
    "equivalently , the known upper limits on @xmath42 and @xmath43 together with the confirmed existence of @xmath44 and @xmath45 neutrino mass eigenstates would _",
    "require _ that the third mass eigenstate be superluminal with @xmath46 .",
    "one might also object that masses as large as 4.0 and 21.4 ev are incompatible with the two well - measured neutrino oscillation results for the @xmath47 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 that suggest very small values for the masses themselves .",
    "however , one could accommodate those two measured values if there were three sterile neutrinos two of which were nearly degenerate with the 4.0 ev and 21.4 ev active neutrinos , and also if the measured @xmath47 values to date are between one active and one sterile neutrino .",
    "the empirical basis for sterile neutrinos has been gaining strength , since the entire collection of neutrino oscillation experiments can be fit with one or more sterile neutrinos , and they fit best with three of them.@xcite for example , a collective fit with one sterile neutrino has a good probability of 55% but a compatibility between data sets of only 0.043% , while the three sterile neutrino fit has a @xmath50 probability and a compatibility of @xmath51 between data sets.@xcite although one might not be especially impressed with a good fit having as many as free parameters as occurs with 6 oscillating neutrinos , as we shall see later , the number of @xmath52 free parameters is far less than what one might think .",
    "here we discuss a 3 + 3 neutrino model assuming three active / sterile pairs , which differs significantly from earlier models,@xcite because ( a ) one pair is superluminal , ( b ) the mass splitting of each active - sterile pair is very small , and ( c ) the @xmath47 seen in oscillation experiments to date are all between a sterile and an active neutrino .",
    "the 3 + 3 model mass hierarchy is depicted in fig . 1 , and it consists of three right / left handed neutrino doublets , whose mass splittings for the two @xmath53 ( tardyonic ) doublets are taken to be the values found from neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it is of course the right handed states that are the sterile ones  at least in the case of the two tardyonic doublets .",
    "it should be noted that if the @xmath44 and @xmath45 mass eigenstate result is genuine , the mass hierarchy suggested in fig . 1 is the only one compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments , with the exception of switching the two labeled @xmath47 values and reversing the order of each r and l state .",
    "it is extremely interesting that the two mass splittings labeled in fig 1 .",
    "when expressed as a fraction of each doublet s @xmath6 , are identical within experimental uncertainties , i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the fractional mass splitting for the third ( superluminal ) mass doublet has the same value , and @xmath56 as suggested by short - distance accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments,@xcite we then find an approximate mass of the superluminal mass doublet : @xmath57 .      in a 3 + 3 global fit to all experiments",
    "the main interest is in seeing whether any large @xmath47 values are required to get a good fit ( beyond the well - measured 3 small @xmath47 ) , and what constraints can be placed on their values .",
    "as is well known , in the standard mass hierarchy , one assumes that the three active neutrino masses have @xmath58 and the one or more sterile neutrinos are considerably heavier .",
    "the basis of this hierarchy rests on the assumption that the two very small well - measured @xmath47 values from oscillation experiments are both between the three active neutrinos ( 1,2,3 ) , while in our model they are each between the two members of an active - sterile doublet . in other words ,",
    "the well - measured value of @xmath59 is assigned to our @xmath60 and that of @xmath61 to our @xmath62  a difference that is irresolvable in a given experiment , whether one is doing a search for actual oscillations or the appearance / disappearance of a flavor state .",
    "the distinction between the two model hierarchies is of vital importance , however , when doing a 3 + 3 global fit to all experiments , since it will affect the best fit values of the three large @xmath63 thus , the conrad et .",
    "3 + 3 fit was based on the standard mass hierarchy in which the three active neutrinos are much lighter than the three sterile ones.@xcite in this fit there are only three independent large @xmath47 values which they take to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 only the first of conrad s three fitted large @xmath47 agree with those predicted from our 3 + 3 model , which are @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68  see fig .",
    "this disagreement is to be expected , of course , given the differences between our mass hierarchy and the conventional one conrad et .",
    "al . used in doing their fit .",
    "thus , in our 3 + 3 model there is only one @xmath69 not two .",
    "in addition the three independent large @xmath47 values in our model are @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( 3 double arrows in fig .",
    "1 ) , and the other large @xmath47 are given in terms of them .",
    "for example , these eight large @xmath47 are all approximately equal to three significant figures : @xmath72 as are these four : @xmath73 these equivalencies would be more obvious had all the @xmath47 spacings been drawn to scale .",
    "given the highly controversial nature of the claims made in the previous section it is useful to summarize earlier evidence for tachyonic neutrinos before considering theoretical support for them , and how those claims can be tested  in some cases using existing data .",
    "chodos , hauser and kostelecky in 1985@xcite suggested that one could test whether electron neutrinos are tachyons based on the beta decay of stable particles whose energy exceeds some threshold . in 1999 , following a suggestion by kostelecky,@xcite ehrlich adopted this idea to modeling the cosmic ray spectrum.@xcite it is well known that the observed spectrum satisfies a power law @xmath75 where @xmath76 changes value relatively abruptly at an energy in the vicinity of 4 pev , which is known as the knee of the spectrum .",
    "one can interpret the presence of the knee using the chodos et .",
    "idea that protons are decaying with this energy as their threshold , and they are increasingly depleted from the spectrum above this energy . for protons , the threshold energy is inversely related to the absolute value of the tachyon mass ( in @xmath19 ) through@xcite    @xmath77    a second change in the spectrum power law known as the ankle occurs around @xmath78 in ehrlich s model a good fit was obtained to the high energy spectrum ( including both the knee and the ankle ) , by assuming @xmath79      one important prediction of the fit to the cosmic ray spectrum was the existence of a neutron line ( from proton decay ) that occurred right at the knee.@xcite evidence for a neutron line at the knee was subsequently reported based on cosmic rays pointing back to cygnus x-3 , an x - ray binary having a 4.79 h period.@xcite at pev - scale energies cosmic rays pointing back to a particular distant source constitutes evidence that those primary cosmic rays are neutral particles , given the strength of the galactic magnetic field . of the four groups that had reported high energy cosmic rays from cygnus x-3 during the 1970@xmath80s and 1980@xmath80s with signal strengths at the 4 - 5 @xmath81 level ,",
    "only the lloyd - evans group had events above 1 pev.@xcite that data showed an excess of 28.4 events in two adjacent energy bins straddling 5 pev , with an uncertainty in the two bin total of 5.0 events , i.e. , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , the energy at which the peak occurs came very near the knee of the spectrum , which was previously interpreted as the threshold for protons to beta decay into neutrons . given that evidence also existed for the cygnus x-3 cosmic rays being neutral hadrons , ehrlich interpreted the 4.5 pev peak associated with cygnus x-3 as a confirmation of the earlier prediction of a neutron line at the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum.@xcite today many cosmic ray researchers express skepticism about the reality of those early reports of cosmic rays from cygnus x-3 .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the only primary cosmic rays pointing back to sources at pev energies are photons or neutrinos .",
    "in fact , a more recent high statistics cosmic ray study failed to observe non - episodic cosmic rays from cygnus x-3 at pev energies.@xcite however , it should be noted that this negative result need not disprove the validity of the earlier observations since cygnus x-3 is known to be an episodic source that is especially intense at times of strong radio flares when the rf luminosity increases a thousand fold .",
    "while there is yet no commonly accepted field theory of tachyons , a number of researchers including ciborowski , rembielinski , and radzikowski have made important steps towards such a theory.@xcite there are , however , many theoretical reasons that have been cited for being skeptical of superluminal neutrinos , including the magnitude of the violation of lorentz invariance ( vli ) that they might entail.@xcite however , while these vli constraints and the cohen - glashow ( c - g ) effect@xcite conflict with a @xmath5 as large as the initial spurious opera value , they do not rule out much smaller values below the upper limits set by various experiments.@xcite in particular , note that for the c - g effect the threshold energy for tachyonic neutrino bremsstrahlung varies as @xmath84 so the effect is of no consequence for very small @xmath85 thus , neither vli nor the c - g effect is an argument against superluminal neutrinos in general .",
    "moreover , not only has vli been shown to be compatible with extensions of the standard model,@xcite but chodos recently has provided a theoretical rationale for tachyonic neutrinos.@xcite he shows that one can construct a lagrangian that satifies light cone reflection , a new spacetime symmetry that arises in the context of a limited form of lorentz invariance , in which @xmath86 neutrino pairs arise naturally . unfortunately , since chodos model explicitly requires that @xmath87 it is not consistent with our 3 + 3 model .",
    "one that is consistent is a theory by jentschura and wundt who generalize the dirac equation , based on a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "their theory allows for a left - handed tachyonic neutrino mass eigenstate with a free mass parameter that is compatible with our value of @xmath88@xcite and it also leaves room for the addition of sterile neutrinos.@xcite moreover , the same authors note that these extensions to the dirac equation allow tachyonic neutrinos to be a candidate for the acceleration of the universe or dark energy.@xcite",
    "the first proposed test is the least intereting one , and is likely only to result in setting upper limits , while all the rest involve testing far more specific predictions discussed earlier .    [",
    "[ time - of - flight - experimental - searches - for - no - specific - m_nu20 ] ] time of flight experimental searches for no specific @xmath89 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    time of flight experiments involving earthly distances should be feasible so long as a tachyon had an @xmath90 on the order of many @xmath91 the lowest mass one might be able to detect using earthly distances might be around @xmath92 based on eq .",
    "1 using @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . such a result would be many orders of magnitude smaller than the original opera claim .      if the forthcoming katrin experiment designed to have a sensitivity of @xmath97 or @xmath98@xcite fails to see a tachyonic electron neutrino , a pev - scale cosmic ray experiment might well do so . in particular , finding confirming evidence for cosmic ray protons decaying at or above the knee of the spectrum and giving rise to a neutron line at that energy would be very convincing evidence .",
    "of course , pev - scale cosmic rays from the binary star cygnus x-3 have been widely dismissed as an aberration by most cosmic ray researchers , in light of the very high statistics later negative search which found no indication of a steady state signal from that source.@xcite a new experiment that looked at cygnus x-3 and other possible sources , but @xmath99 at times of large flares , and in a narrow phase window based on the binary s period might well show a signal .

    "one possibile test might come from a global fit to all oscillation experiments to see if one finds three large @xmath47 values , consistent with those predicted by the 3 + 3 model masses , as discussed in an earlier section .",
    "another test would be provided by the fortunate occurence of a supernova in a our galaxy or another one nearby , but these occur only about twice in a century .",
    "there is , however , no need to wait for another galactic supernova , since the existence of mass eigenstates @xmath100 and @xmath101 are quite within the realm of a short baseline neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "for example , given @xmath102 we find @xmath103 ( for e = 1 gev )",
    ". a particularly suitable neutrino source might be the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at the oak ridge national laboratory , given its high intensity , short pulse width , and the large percentage ( about 30 % ) of neutrino flux that is monochromatic ( @xmath104 ) . at this neutrino energy",
    "we find that @xmath105 would yield an oscillation wavelength of about 34 cm , which could be readily observed .",
    "searching for a @xmath106 neutrino in an oscillation experiment should be doable at very high neutrino energies .",
    "for example , the predicted oscillation wavelength between @xmath106 and some much smaller mass is @xmath107 ( for e = 1 tev ) or @xmath108 ( for e = 100 gev ) .",
    "however , such a test could not distinguish between @xmath106 and @xmath109 one measurement that could make this sign distinction would be an unreported and possibly unexamined aspect of the existing data on neutrinos from sn 1987a .",
    "for a typical neutrino energy of 20 mev , @xmath110 neutrinos would have arrived around 25 min earlier than the main neutrino pulse . of course , based on eq . 2 any such superluminal neutrinos",
    "would be spread over many minutes and would not be recognized as a pulse above background because of their spread in energy .",
    "nevertheless , given the energy dependence of the background events , there is a surprisingly simple way to discern a superluminal signal  at least for the kamioka data for which nearly all the background events in the detector have energies below 12 mev  the height of the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ( lower graph ) .",
    "the 17 minute time interval depicted in fig .",
    "2 ( lower ) includes the 12 event neutrino burst reported by kamioka seen just after 7:35 ut . in order to investigate background more thoroughly kamioka",
    "has provided similar plots for 7 other time intervals selected at random , some before the 12 event pulse and some after.@xcite if we exclude the one 17 minute interval that happens to fall in the one hour before the 12 event burst , kamioka shows only one background event out of about 1000 that has an energy above 12 mev in the entire 7 x 17 = 119 minutes , or about 0.5 background events per hour . thus , selecting only events having @xmath111 is an extremely powerful background suppressor .",
    "recall that on a plot of @xmath26 versus neutrino arrival time @xmath27 events corresponding to a specific neutrino mass lie on a straight line passing through the origin whose slope is inversely proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "given that 8 of the 12 actual sn 1987a events observed in kamioka have @xmath112 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , it would not be surprising that any superluminal eigenstate might have perhaps 4 neutrinos associated with it for which @xmath113 the four dots in fig . 2 ( upper ) shows what the signature might look like for such a @xmath106 signal .",
    "those four simulated events were arbitrarily assumed to have a uniform time distribution ( equivalent to @xmath114 ) .",
    "note that there is no real need to do anything more realistic here , given the extremely low background ",
    "perhaps 0.5 background events in the 1 hour interval before 7:35 ut , as long as we focus only on events having @xmath115 thus , should the @xmath26 versus t plot of the kamioka neutrino data for this one hour period show perhaps 4 real events falling @xmath116 on a line through the origin having the predicted approximate slope corresponding to @xmath117 this would constitute an unambiguous signature of a superluminal neutrino .    a tantalizing hint that this possibility might be due to more than the author s feverish imagination is provided by the one real kamioka event ( the square in fig .",
    "2 upper graph ) that falls in the only 17 min time interval falling in the one hour before the 12 event burst .",
    "this event lies quite near the predicted straight line .",
    "it is silly to provide a calculation of the probability of this occurring based on random background , given only one event , but it is probably only about 1/100 .",
    "this estimate is based on the likelihood of a background event occuring in that 17 minute interval ( about 1/10 ) , and its likelihood of it lying very close to the predicted line ( about 1/10 ) .",
    "this one event proves nothing , but if it were possible for kamioka , imb and baksan to reexamine their old data one might find more persuasive confirming evidence .",
