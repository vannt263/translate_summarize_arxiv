    "ever since the birth of quantum mechanics , there has been curiosity about the special role that the complex numbers play in this theory . of course",
    ", one could also ask about the role of real numbers in classical mechanics : to a large extent , this question concerns the role of the continuum in physical theories . in quantum mechanics",
    "there is a new twist .",
    "classically , observables are described by real - valued functions . in quantum mechanics , they are described by self - adjoint operators on a complex hilbert space . in both theories ,",
    "the expectation value of an observable in any state is _",
    "real_. but the complex numbers play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics that is not apparent in classical mechanics .",
    "the puzzle is heightened by the fact that we can formulate many aspects of quantum theory using real numbers or quaternions instead of complex numbers .",
    "there are precisely four ` normed division algebras ' : the real numbers @xmath0 , the complex numbers @xmath1 , the quaternions @xmath2 and the octonions @xmath3 . roughly speaking , these are the number systems extending the reals that have an ` absolute value ' obeying the equation @xmath4 .",
    "since the octonions are nonassociative it proves difficult to formulate quantum theory based on these , except in a few special cases .",
    "but the other three number systems support the machinery of quantum theory quite nicely .    indeed , as far back as 1934 ,",
    "jordan , von neumann and wigner  @xcite saw real , complex and quaternionic quantum theory appear on an equal footing in their classification of algebras of observables .",
    "these authors classified _ finite - dimensional _ algebras of observables , but later their work was generalized to the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "we review some of these classification theorems in section  [ classification ] .    at first glance",
    ", the lesson seems to be that real , complex and quaternionic quantum theory stand on an equal footing , at least mathematically . in particular , while quaternionic hilbert spaces may be unfamiliar , we shall see their definition soon , and they turn out to be quite well - behaved in many respects . but experiments seem to show that our universe is described by the complex version of quantum theory , not the real or quaternionic version .",
    "so how did nature decide among these three choices ?",
    "in fact , the real and quaternionic versions of quantum theory have some ` problems ' , or at least striking differences from the familiar complex version .",
    "first , they lack the usual correspondence between strongly continuous one - parameter unitary groups and self - adjoint operators , which in the complex case goes by the name of stone s theorem .",
    "second , the tensor product of two quaternionic hilbert spaces is not a quaternionic hilbert space .",
    "we discuss these issues in section  [ problems ] .",
    "one could take these ` problems ' as the explanation of why nature uses complex quantum theory , and let the matter drop there .",
    "but this would be shortsighted . indeed , the main claim of this paper is that instead of being distinct alternatives , real , complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are three aspects of a single unified structure .",
    "nature did not choose one : she chose all three !",
    "the evidence for this goes back to a very old idea in group theory : the frobenius ",
    "schur indicator @xcite .",
    "this is a way of computing a number from an irreducible unitary representation of a compact group @xmath5 on a complex hilbert space @xmath6 , say @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the group of unitary operators on @xmath6 .",
    "any such representation is finite - dimensional , so we can take the trace of the operator @xmath9 for any group element @xmath10 , and then perform the integral @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath5 .",
    "this integral is the * frobenius  schur indicator*. it always equals @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and these three cases correspond to whether the representation @xmath16 is ` real ' , ` complex ' or ` quaternionic ' .",
    "here we are using these words in a technical sense .",
    "remember , the hilbert space @xmath6 is complex .",
    "however :    * if the frobenius ",
    "schur indicator is @xmath13 , then @xmath16 is the complexification of a representation of @xmath5 on some real hilbert space . in this case",
    "we call @xmath16 * real*. * if the frobenius  schur indicator is @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is the underlying complex representation of a representation of @xmath5 on some quaternionic hilbert space . in this case",
    "we call @xmath16 * quaternionic*. * if the frobenius ",
    "schur indicator is @xmath14 , then neither of the above alternatives hold . in this case",
    "we call @xmath16 * complex*.    the frobenius ",
    "schur indicator is an appealingly concrete way to decide whether an irreducible representation is real , quaternionic or complex .",
    "however , the significance of this threefold classification is made much clearer by another result , which focuses on the key concept of _ duality_. the represention @xmath16 has a dual @xmath17 , which is a unitary representation of @xmath5 on the dual hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "of course , the hilbert space @xmath6 has the same dimension as its dual , so they are isomorphic .",
    "the question thus arises : is the representation @xmath16 isomorphic to its dual ? instead of a simple yes - or - no answer , it turns out there are three cases :    * the representation @xmath16 is real iff it is isomorphic to its dual thanks to the existence of an invariant nondegenerate _",
    "bilinear form @xmath19 . *",
    "the representation @xmath16 is quaternionic iff it is isomorphic to its dual thanks to the existence of an invariant nondegenerate _",
    "bilinear form @xmath19 . *",
    "the representation @xmath16 is complex iff it is not isomorphic to its dual .",
    "we recall the proof of this result in section  [ three - fold ] .",
    "freeman dyson called it the ` three - fold way '  @xcite .",
    "it also appears among vladimir arnold s list of ` trinities '  @xcite .",
    "so , in some sense it is well known . however , its implications for the foundations of quantum theory seem to have been insufficiently explored .    what are the implications of the three - fold way ?",
    "first , since elementary particles are often described using irreducible unitary representations of compact groups , it means that particles come in three kinds : real , complex and quaternionic ! of course",
    "the details depend not just on the particle itself , but on the group of symmetries we consider .",
    "for example , take any spin-@xmath20 particle , and consider only its rotational symmetries . then we can describe this particle using a unitary representation of @xmath21 on @xmath22 .",
    "this representation is quaternionic .",
    "why ? because we can think of a pair of complex numbers as a quaternion , and @xmath21 as the group of unit quaternions .",
    "the spin-@xmath20 representation of @xmath21 is then revealed to be the action of unit quaternions on the quaternions via left multiplication .    in slogan form : _ qubits are not just quantum  they are also quaternionic ! _ more generally , all particles of half - integer spin are quaternionic , while particles of integer spin are real , as long as we consider them only as representations of @xmath21 .    this explains why the square of time reversal is @xmath13 for particles of integer spin , but @xmath15 for particles of half - integer spin .",
    "time reversal is ` antilinear ' : it commutes with real scalars but anticommutes with multiplication by @xmath23 .",
    "an antilinear operator whose square is @xmath13 acts like complex conjugation .",
    "so , we automatically get such an operator on the complexification of any real hilbert space .",
    "an antilinear operator whose square is @xmath15 acts like the quaternion unit @xmath24 , since @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "so , we get such an operator on the underlying complex hilbert space of any quaternionic hilbert space",
    ".    there is a nice heuristic argument for the same fact using ` string diagrams ' , which are a mathematical generalization of feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "any irreducible representation of @xmath21 has an invariant nondegenerate bilinear form @xmath27 .",
    "this is symmetric : @xmath28 when the spin is an integer , and antisymmetric @xmath29 when the spin is a half - integer .",
    "so , in terms of string diagrams : @xmath30 if we manipulate this equation a bit , we get : @xmath31 the diagram at left shows a particle reversing its direction in time twice , so not surprisingly , the square of time reversal is @xmath32 depending on whether the spin is an integer or half - integer .",
    "but we can also see more .",
    "suppose we draw the diagram at left as a ` ribbon ' : @xmath33{ribbon1.eps } } ;   \\endxy\\ ] ] then , pulling it tight , we get a ribbon with a 360 degree twist in it : @xmath33{ribbon2.eps } } ;   \\endxy\\ ] ] and indeed , rotating a particle by 360 degrees gives a phase of @xmath34 if its spin is an integer , and @xmath15 if its spin is a half - integer .",
    "so this well - known fact is yet another manifestation of the real / quaternionic distinction .",
    "we explain these ideas further in section  [ physics ] .",
    "more broadly , the three - fold way suggests that complex quantum theory _ contains _ the real and quaternionic theories .",
    "indeed , this can be made precise with the help of some category theory .",
    "let @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the categories of real , complex and quaternionic hilbert spaces , respectively .",
    "then there are ` faithful functors ' from @xmath35 and @xmath37 into @xmath36 .",
    "this is a way of making precise the fact that we can treat real or quaternionic hilbert spaces as complex hilbert spaces equipped with extra structure .",
    "the extra structure is just a nondegenerate bilinear form @xmath19 , which is symmetric in the real case and antisymmetric in the quaternionic case .",
    "since complex quantum theory contains the real and quaternionic theories , we might be tempted to conclude that the complex theory is fundamental , with the other theories arising as offshoots .",
    "but we can also faithfully map @xmath36 and @xmath37 into @xmath35 .",
    "we can even faithfully map @xmath35 and @xmath36 into @xmath37 !",
    "we describe these faithful functors in section  [ categories ] .",
    "so , one may argue that no one form of quantum mechanics is primordial : each contains the other two !",
    "we provide details in section  [ categories ] .",
    "then , in section  [ solutions ] , we use the relation between the three forms of quantum theory to solve the problems with real and quaternionic quantum mechanics raised earlier .",
    "the laws of algebra constrain the possibilities for theories that closely resemble the quantum mechanics we know and love .",
    "various classification theorems delimit the possibilities .",
    "of course , theorems have hypotheses .",
    "it is easy to get around these theorems by weakening our criteria for what counts as a theory ` closely resembling ' quantum mechanics ; if we do this , we can find a large number of alternative theories .",
    "this is especially clear in the category - theoretic framework , where many theories based on convex sets of states give rise to categories of physical systems and processes sharing some features of standard quantum mechanics  @xcite . here , however , we focus on results that pick out real , complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics as special .",
    "our treatment is far from complete ; it is merely meant as a sketch of the subject .",
    "in particular , while we describe the jordan algebra approach to quantum systems with finitely many degrees of freedom , and also the approach based on convex sets , we neglect the approach based on lattices of propositions .",
    "good introductions to this enormous subject include the paper by steirteghem and stubbe  @xcite and the classic texts by piron  @xcite and varadarajan  @xcite .      after discovering that complex numbers could be viewed as simply pairs of real numbers , hamilton sought an algebra of ` triples ' where addition , subtraction , multiplication and division obeyed most of the same rules .",
    "alas , what he was seeking did not exist .",
    "after much struggle , he discovered the ` quaternions ' : an algebra consisting of expressions of the form @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , equipped with the associative product with unit @xmath13 uniquely characterized by these equations : @xmath40 he carved these equations into a bridge as soon he discovered them .",
    "he spent the rest of his life working on the quaternions , so this algebra is now called @xmath2 in his honor .    the day",
    "after hamilton discovered the quaternions , he sent a letter describing them to his college friend john graves .",
    "a few months later graves invented yet another algebra , now called the ` octonions ' and denoted @xmath3 .",
    "the octonions are expressions of the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the multiplication of octonions is not associative , but it is still easily described using the * fano plane * , a projective plane with 7 points and 7 lines :    = 1.5 in    [ fano ]    the ` lines ' here are the sides of the triangle , its altitudes , and the circle containing the midpoints of the sides .",
    "each line contains three points , and each of these triples has a cyclic ordering , as shown by the arrows .",
    "if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are cyclically ordered in this way then @xmath45 together with these rules :    * @xmath13 is the multiplicative identity , * @xmath46 are square roots of -1 ,    the fano plane completely describes the algebra structure of the octonions . as an exercise",
    ", we urge the reader to check that the octonions are nonassociative .    what is so great about the number systems discovered by hamilton and graves ?",
    "like the real and complex numbers , they are ` normed division algebras ' . for us , an * algebra * will be a real vector space @xmath47 equipped with a multiplication @xmath48 that is real - linear in each argument .",
    "we do not assume our algebras are associative .",
    "we say an algebra @xmath47 is * unital * if there exists an element @xmath49 with @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",
    "and we define a * normed division algebra * to be a unital algebra equipped with a norm @xmath52 obeying the rule @xmath53 as a consequence , we have @xmath54    the real and complex numbers are obviously normed division algebras . for the quaternions we can define the norm to be :",
    "@xmath55 a similar formula works for the octonions : @xmath56 with some sweat , one can check that these rules make @xmath2 and @xmath3 into normed division algebras .",
    "the marvelous fact is that there are no more ! in an 1898 paper",
    ", hurwitz proved that @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the only finite - dimensional normed division algebras  @xcite . in 1960 , urbanik and wright  @xcite removed the finite - dimensionality condition :    [ urbanik and wright ] every normed division algebra is isomorphic to either @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .    for quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is important that every normed division algebra is a * -algebra * , meaning it is equipped with a real - linear map @xmath57 obeying these rules : @xmath58 for @xmath1 this map is just complex conjugation , while for @xmath0 it is the identity map . for the quaternions it is given by : @xmath59 and for the octonions , @xmath60 one can check in all four cases we have @xmath61    for the three associative normed division algebras ,",
    "the @xmath62-algebra structure lets us set up a theory of hilbert spaces .",
    "let us quickly sketch how .",
    "suppose @xmath63 is an associative normed division algebra",
    ". then we define a * @xmath63-vector space * to be a right @xmath63-module : that is , an abelian group @xmath64 equipped with a map @xmath65 that obeys the laws @xmath66 @xmath67 we say a map @xmath68 between @xmath63-vector spaces is * @xmath63-linear * if @xmath69 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "when no confusion can arise , we call a @xmath63-linear map @xmath68 a * linear operator * or simply an * operator*.    the reader may be appalled that we are multiplying by scalars on the _ right _ here .",
    "it makes no difference except for the quaternions , which are noncommutative . even in that case , we could use either left or right multiplication by scalars , as long as we stick to one convention .",
    "but since we write the operator @xmath72 on the left in the expression @xmath73 , it makes more sense to do scalar multiplication on the right , so no symbols trade places in the law @xmath74 .",
    "there is a category of @xmath63-vector spaces and operators between them . even in the quaternionic case",
    "every @xmath63-vector space has a basis , and any two bases have the same cardinality , so we can talk about the dimension of a vector space over @xmath63 , and every finite - dimensional vector space over @xmath63 is isomorphic to @xmath75 .",
    "every operator @xmath76 can be written as matrix : @xmath77    the @xmath62-algebra structure of the normed division algebras becomes important when we study hilbert spaces .",
    "we define an * inner product * on a @xmath63-vector space @xmath64 to be a map @xmath78 that is @xmath63-linear in the second argument , has @xmath79 for all @xmath80 , and is * positive definite * : @xmath81 with equality only if @xmath82 . as usual ,",
    "an inner product gives a norm : @xmath83 and we say a @xmath63-vector space with inner product is a * @xmath63-hilbert space * if this norm makes the vector space into a complete metric space .",
    "every finite - dimensional @xmath63-hilbert space is isomorphic to @xmath75 with its standard inner product @xmath84    this is fine for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 : what about @xmath3 ?",
    "it would be nice if we could think of @xmath85 as an @xmath86-dimensional octonionic vector space , with scalar multiplication defined in the obvious way .",
    "unfortunately , the law @xmath87 fails , because the octonions are nonassociative !",
    "furthermore , there are no maps @xmath88 obeying @xmath89 except the zero map .",
    "so , nobody has managed to develop a good theory of octonionic linear algebra .",
    "while the octonions are nonassociative , they are still * alternative*. that is , the associative law holds whenever two of the elements being multiplied are equal : @xmath90 surprisingly , this is enough to let us carry out a bit of quantum theory as if @xmath3 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 were well - defined octonionic hilbert spaces .",
    "the 3-dimensional case is by far the most exciting : it leads to a structure called the ` exceptional jordan algebra ' .",
    "but beyond dimension 3 , it seems there is little to say .      in 1932 ,",
    "pascual jordan tried to isolate some axioms that an ` algebra of observables ' should satisfy  @xcite .",
    "the unadorned phrase ` algebra ' usually signals an associative algebra , but this is not the kind of algebra jordan was led to . in both classical and quantum mechanics ,",
    "observables are closed under addition and multiplication by real scalars . in classical mechanics",
    "we can also multiply observables , but in quantum mechanics this becomes problematic .",
    "after all , given two bounded self - adjoint operators on a complex hilbert space , their product is self - adjoint if and only if they commute .",
    "however , in quantum mechanics one can still raise an observable to a power and obtain another observable . from squaring and taking real linear combinations",
    ", one can construct a commutative product : @xmath93 this product is not associative , but it is * power - associative * : any way of parenthesizing a product of copies of the same observable @xmath94 gives the same result .",
    "this led jordan to define what is now called a * formally real jordan algebra * : a real vector space with a bilinear , commutative and power - associative product satisfying @xmath95 for all @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out that every finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra is in fact unital",
    ". moreover , the last condition gives @xmath47 a partial ordering : if we write @xmath96 when the element @xmath97 is a sum of squares , it says @xmath98 so , in a formally real jordan algebra it makes sense to speak of one observable being ` greater ' than another .    in 1934",
    ", jordan published a paper with von neumann and wigner classifying finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebras  @xcite .",
    "they began by proving that any such algebra is a direct sum of ` simple ' ones .",
    "a formally real jordan algebra is * simple * when it has exactly two different ideals , @xmath99 and @xmath47 itself . here , as usual , an * ideal * is a vector subspace @xmath100 such that @xmath101 implies @xmath102 for all @xmath51 .",
    "and then , they proved :    every simple finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra is isomorphic to exactly one on this list :    * the algebras @xmath103 of @xmath104 self - adjoint real matrices with product @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",

    ", we can identify a self - adjoint @xmath104 matrix with an operator @xmath116 that is * self - adjoint * in the sense that @xmath117 for all @xmath118 . in the octonionic case",
    "we do not know what hilbert spaces and operators are , but we can still work with matrices .",
    "the @xmath119 self - adjoint matrices with entries in any normed division algebra form a jordan algebra isomorphic to the real numbers .",
    "this is also isomorphic to the spin factor with @xmath120 . as we shall see very soon , the @xmath121 self - adjoint matrices with entries in any normed division algebra also form a jordan algebra isomorphic to a spin factor .",
    "curiously , in the octonionic case we can not go beyond @xmath110 self - adjoint matrices and still get a jordan algebra .",
    "the @xmath110 self - adjoint octonionic matrices form a 27-dimensional formally real jordan algebra called the * exceptional jordan algebra*.    what does all this mean for physics ?",
    "the spin factors are related to clifford algebras and spinors , hence their name .",
    "they also have an intriguing relation to special relativity , since @xmath112 can be identified with @xmath122-dimensional minkowski spacetime , and its cone of positive elements is then revealed to be none other than the future lightcone . furthermore",
    ", we have some interesting coincidences :    * the jordan algebra @xmath123 is isomorphic to the spin factor @xmath124 . *",
    "the jordan algebra @xmath125 is isomorphic to the spin factor @xmath126 . *",
    "the jordan algebra @xmath127 is isomorphic to the spin factor @xmath128 .",
    "* the jordan algebra @xmath129 is isomorphic to the spin factor @xmath130 .",
    "this sets up a relation between the real numbers , complex numbers , quaternions and octonions and the minkowski spacetimes of dimensions 3,4,6 and 10 .",
    "these are precisely the dimensions where a classical superstring lagrangian can be written down !",
    "far from being a coincidence , this is the tip of a huge and still not fully fathomed iceberg , which we have discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the exceptional jordan algebra remains mysterious .",
    "practically ever since it was discovered , physicists have looked for some application of this entity .",
    "for example , when it was first found that quarks come in three colors , okubo and others hoped that @xmath110 self - adjoint octonionic matrices might serve as observables for these exotic degrees of freedom  @xcite . alas ,",
    "nothing much came of this .",
    "more recently , people have discovered some relationships between 10-dimensional string theory and the exceptional jordan algebra , arising from the fact that the @xmath121 self - adjoint octonionic matrices can be identified with 10-dimensional minkowski spacetime  @xcite . but nothing definitive has emerged so far .    in 1983 , zelmanov generalized the jordan  von neumann  wigner classification to the infinite - dimensional case , working with jordan algebras that need not be formally real  @xcite . in any formally real jordan algebra ,",
    "the following peculiar law holds : @xmath131 any vector space with a commutative bilinear product obeying this law is called a * jordan algebra*. zelmanov classified the simple jordan algebras and proved they are all of three kinds : a kind generalizing jordan algebras of self - adjoint matrices , a kind generalizing spin factors , and an ` exceptional ' kind . for a good introduction to this work ,",
    "see mccrimmon s book  @xcite .",
    "zelmanov s classification theorem does not highlight the special role of the reals , complex numbers and quaternions .",
    "indeed , when we drop the ` formally real ' condition , a host of additional finite - dimensional simple jordan algebras appear , beside those in jordan , von neumann and wigner s classification theorem .",
    "while it is an algebraic _ tour de force _ , nobody has yet used zelmanov s theorem to shed new light on quantum theory .",
    "so , we postpone infinite - dimensional considerations until section  [ soler ] , where we discuss the remarkable theorem of solr .",
    "the formalism of jordan algebras seems rather removed from the actual practice of physics , because in quantum theory we hardly ever take two observables @xmath94 and @xmath132 and form their jordan product @xmath133 .",
    "as hinted in the previous section , it is better to think of this operation as derived from the process of _ squaring _ an observable , which is something we actually do .",
    "but still , we can not help wondering : does the classification of finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebras , and thus the special role of normed division algebras , arise from some axiomatic framework more closely tied to quantum physics as it usually practiced ?",
    "one answer involves the correspondence between states and observables .",
    "consider first the case of ordinary quantum theory .",
    "if a quantum system has the hilbert space @xmath134 , observables are described by self - adjoint @xmath104 complex matrices : elements of the jordan algebra @xmath107 . but",
    "matrices of this form that are nonnegative and have trace 1 also play another role .",
    "they are called * density matrices * , and they describe _ states _ of our quantum system : not just pure states , but also more general mixed states .",
    "the idea is that any density matrix @xmath135 allows us to define expectation values of observables @xmath136 via @xmath137 the map sending observables to their expectation values is real - linear .",
    "the fact that @xmath16 is nonnegative is equivalent to @xmath138 and the fact that @xmath16 has trace 1 is equivalent to @xmath139    of course , states lie in the dual of the space of observables : that much is obvious , given that the expectation value of an observable should depend linearly on the observable .",
    "the more mysterious thing is that we can identify the vector space of observables with its dual : @xmath140 using the trace , which puts a real - valued inner product on the space of observables : @xmath141 thus , states also _ correspond to _ certain observables : the nonnegative ones having trace 1 .",
    "we call this fact the * state - observable correspondence*.    all this generalizes to an arbitrary finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra @xmath47 .",
    "every such algebra automatically has an identity element  @xcite .",
    "this lets us define a * state * on @xmath47 to be a linear functional @xmath142 that is * nonnegative * : @xmath143 and * normalized * : @xmath144 but in fact , there is a one - to - one correspondence between linear functionals on @xmath47 and elements of @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is that every finite - dimensional jordan algebra has a * trace * @xmath145 defined so that @xmath146 is the trace of the linear operator @xmath147 such a jordan algebra is then formally real if and only if @xmath148 is a real - valued inner product .",
    "so , when @xmath47 is a finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra , any linear functional @xmath142 can be written as @xmath149 for a unique element @xmath150 .",
    "conversely , every element @xmath151 gives a linear functional by this formula . while not obvious , it is true that the linear functional @xmath152 is nonnegative if and only if @xmath153 in terms of the ordering on @xmath47 .",
    "more obviously , @xmath152 is normalized if and only if @xmath154 .",
    "so , states can be identified with certain special observables : namely , those observables @xmath150 with @xmath153 and @xmath154 .    in short : whenever the observables in our theory form a finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra , we have a state - observable correspondence . but what is the physical meaning of the state - observable correspondence ? why in the world should _ states _ correspond to special _",
    "observables ? _    here is one attempt at an answer .",
    "every finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra comes equipped with a distinguished observable , the most boring one of all : the identity , @xmath49 .",
    "this is nonnegative , so if we normalize it , we get an observable @xmath155 of the special kind that corresponds to a state .",
    "this state , say @xmath156 , is just the normalized trace : @xmath157 and this state has a clear physical meaning : it is the * state of maximal ignorance * !",
    "it is the state where we know as little as possible about our system  or more precisely , at least in the case of ordinary complex quantum theory , the state where entropy is maximized .    for example",
    ", consider @xmath158 , the algebra of observables of a spin-@xmath20 particle .",
    "then the space of states is the so - called ` bloch sphere ' , really a 3-dimensional ball . on the surface of this ball",
    "are the pure states , the states where we know as much as possible about the particle . at the center of the ball",
    "is the state of maximum ignorance .",
    "this corresponds to the density matrix @xmath159 in this state , when we measure the particle s spin along any axis , we have a @xmath20 chance of getting spin up and a @xmath20 chance of spin down .    returning to the general situation , note that @xmath47 always acts on its dual @xmath160 : given @xmath51 and a linear functional @xmath161 , we get a new linear functional @xmath162 .",
    "this captures the idea , familiar in quantum theory , that observables are also ` operators ' .",
    "the state - observable correspondence arises naturally from this : we can get any state by acting on the state of complete ignorance with a suitable observable .",
    "after all , any state corresponds to some observable @xmath16 , as follows : @xmath149 so , we can get this state by acting on the state of maximal ignorance , @xmath156 , by the observable @xmath163 : @xmath164    so , we see that the state - observable correspondence springs from two causes . first , there is a distinguished state , the state of maximal ignorance .",
    "second , any other state can be obtained from the state of maximal ignorance by acting on it with a suitable observable .",
    "while these thoughts raise a host of questions , they also help motivate an important theorem of koecher and vinberg  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to axiomatize the situation we have just described , in a way that does not mention the jordan product in @xmath47 , but instead emphasizes :    * the state - observable correspondence , and * the fact that ` positive ' observables , namely those whose observed values are always positive , form a cone .    to find appropriate axioms ,",
    "suppose @xmath47 is a finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra .",
    "then seven facts are always true .",
    "first , the set of positive observables @xmath165 is a * cone * : that is , @xmath166 implies that every positive multiple of @xmath94 is also in @xmath167 .",
    "second , this cone is * convex * : if @xmath168 then any linear combination @xmath169 with @xmath170 also lies in @xmath167 .",
    "third , it is an open set .",
    "fourth , it is * regular * , meaning that if @xmath94 and @xmath171 are both in the closure @xmath172 , then @xmath173",
    ". this last condition may seem obscure , but if we note that @xmath174 we see that @xmath167 being regular simply means @xmath175 a perfectly plausible assumption .",
    "next recall that @xmath47 has an inner product ; this is what lets us identify linear functionals on @xmath47 with elements of @xmath47 .",
    "this also lets us define the * dual cone * @xmath176 which one can check is indeed a cone .",
    "the fifth fact about @xmath167 is that it is * self - dual * , meaning @xmath177 .",
    "this formalizes the state - observable correspondence , since it means that states correspond to special observables .",
    "all the elements @xmath166 are positive observables , but certain special ones , namely those with @xmath178 , can also be viewed as states .",
    "the sixth fact is that @xmath167 is * homogeneous * : given any two points @xmath168 , there is a real - linear transformation @xmath179 mapping @xmath167 to itself in a one - to - one and onto way , with the property that @xmath180 .",
    "this says that cone @xmath167 is highly symmetrical : no point of @xmath167 is any ` better ' than any other , at least if we only consider the linear structure of the space @xmath47 , ignoring the jordan product and the trace .    from another viewpoint",
    ", however , there is a very special point of @xmath167 , namely the identity @xmath13 of our jordan algebra . and this brings us to our seventh and final fact : the cone @xmath167 is * pointed * , meaning that it is equipped with a distinguished element ( in this case @xmath181 ) .",
    "as we have seen , this element corresponds to the ` state of complete ignorance ' , at least after we normalize it .    in short : when @xmath47 is a finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebra , @xmath167 is a pointed homogeneous self - dual regular open convex cone .",
    "in fact , there is a category of pointed homogeneous self - dual regular open convex cones , where :    * an object is a finite - dimensional real inner product space @xmath64 equipped with a pointed homogeneous self - dual regular open convex cone @xmath182 . *",
    "a morphism from one object , say @xmath183 , to another , say @xmath184 , is a linear map @xmath68 preserving the inner product and mapping @xmath167 into @xmath185 .",
    "now for the payoff .",
    "the work of koecher and vinberg  @xcite , nicely explained in koecher s minnesota notes  @xcite , shows that :    the category of pointed homogeneous self - dual regular open convex cones is equivalent to the category of finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebras .",
    "this means that the theorem of jordan , von neumann and wigner , described in the previous section , also classifies the pointed homogeneous self - dual regular convex cones !",
    "every pointed homogeneous self - dual regular open convex cones is isomorphic to a direct sum of those on this list :    * the cone of positive elements in @xmath103 for @xmath106 , * the cone of positive elements in @xmath107 for @xmath106 , * the cone of positive elements in @xmath108 for @xmath106 , * the cone of positive elements in @xmath109 , * the future lightcone in @xmath112 for @xmath111 .",
    "some of this deserves a bit of explanation . for @xmath186 ,",
    "an element @xmath187 is * positive * if and only if the corresponding operator @xmath116 has @xmath188 for all nonzero @xmath189 .",
    "a similar trick works for defining positive elements of @xmath109 , but we do not need the details here .",
    "we say an element @xmath190 lies in the * future lightcone * if @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "this of course fits in nicely with the idea that the spin factors are connected to minkowski spacetimes .",
    "finally , there is an obvious notion of direct sum for euclidean spaces with cones , where the direct sum of @xmath183 and @xmath184 is @xmath193 equipped with the cone @xmath194    in summary , self - adjoint operators on real , complex and quaternionic hilbert spaces arise fairly naturally as observables starting from a formalism where the observables form a cone , and we insist on an state - observable correspondence .",
    "there is a well - developed approach to probabilistic theories that works for cones that are neither self - dual nor homogeneous : see for example the work of barnum and coauthors  @xcite .",
    "this has already allowed these authors to shed new light on the physical significance of self - duality  @xcite .",
    "but perhaps further thought on the state - observable correspondence will clarify the meaning of the koecher - vinberg theorem , and help us better understand the appearance of normed division algebras in quantum theory .",
    "finally , we should mention that in pondering the state - observable correspondence , it is worthwhile comparing the ` state - operator correspondence ' .",
    "this is best known in the context of string theory  @xcite , but it really applies whenever we have a @xmath195-algebra of observables , say @xmath47 , equipped with a state @xmath196 .",
    "then the gelfand - naimark - segal construction lets us build a hilbert space @xmath6 on which @xmath47 acts , together with a distinguished unit vector @xmath197 called the ` vacuum state ' .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath6 is built by taking a completion of a quotient of @xmath47 , so a dense set of vectors in @xmath6 come from elements of @xmath47 .",
    "so , we get states from certain observables .",
    "in particular , the vacuum state @xmath198 comes from the element @xmath49 .",
    "this is reminiscent of how in our setup , the state of maximal ignorance comes from the element @xmath13 in the jordan algebra of observables .",
    "but there are also some differences : for example , the gelfand - naimark - segal construction requires choosing a state , and it works for infinite - dimensional @xmath195-algebras , while our construction works for finite - dimensional formally real jordan algebras , which have a canonical state : the state of maximum ignorance .",
    "presumably both constructions are special cases of some more general construction .      in 1995 , maria pia solr  @xcite proved a result which has powerful implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea of solr s theorem is to generalize the concept of hilbert space beyond real , complex and quaternionic hilbert spaces , but then show that under very mild conditions , the only options for _ infinite - dimensional _",
    "hilbert spaces are the usual ones !",
    "our discussion here is largely based on the paper by holland  @xcite .    to state solr s theorem",
    ", we begin by saying what sort of ring our generalized hilbert spaces will be vector spaces over .",
    "we want rings where we can divide , and we want them to have an operation like complex conjugation . a ring is called a * division ring * if every nonzero element @xmath199 has an element @xmath200 for which @xmath201 .",
    "it is called a * -ring * if it is equipped with a function @xmath202 for which : @xmath203 a * division -ring * is a @xmath62-ring that is also a division ring .    now , suppose @xmath63 is a division @xmath62-ring . as before , we define a * @xmath63-vector space * to be a right @xmath63-module . and as before , we say a function @xmath68 between @xmath63-vector spaces is * @xmath63-linear * if @xmath69 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we define a * hermitian form * on a @xmath63-vector space @xmath64 to be a map @xmath78 which is @xmath63-linear in the second argument and obeys the equation @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "we say a hermitian form is * nondegenerate * if @xmath204    suppose @xmath6 is a @xmath63-vector space with a nondegenerate hermitian form . then we can define various concepts familiar from the theory of hilbert spaces . for example , we say a sequence @xmath205 is * orthonormal * if @xmath206 . for any vector subspace @xmath207",
    ", we define the * orthogonal complement * @xmath208 by @xmath209 we say @xmath210 is * closed * if @xmath211 .",
    "finally , we say @xmath6 is * orthomodular * if @xmath212 for every closed subspace @xmath210 .",
    "this is automatically true if @xmath6 is a real , complex , or quaternionic hilbert space .",
    "we are now ready to state solr s theorem :    let @xmath63 be a division @xmath62-ring , and let @xmath6 be a @xmath63-vector space equipped with an orthomodular hermitian form for which there exists an infinite orthonormal sequence",
    ". then @xmath63 is isomorphic to @xmath213 or @xmath2 , and @xmath6 is an infinite - dimensional @xmath63-hilbert space .",
    "nothing in the assumptions mentions the continuum : the hypotheses are purely algebraic .",
    "it therefore seems quite magical that @xmath63 is forced to be the real numbers , complex numbers or quaternions .",
    "the orthomodularity condition is the key . in 1964",
    ", piron had attempted to prove that any orthomodular complex inner product space must be a hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "his proof had a flaw which ameniya and araki fixed a few years later  @xcite .",
    "their proof also handles the real and quaternionic cases .",
    "eventually these ideas led solr to realize that orthomodularity picks out real , complex , and quaternionic hilbert spaces as special .",
    "holland s review article  @xcite describes the implications of solr s results for other axiomatic approaches to quantum theory : for example , approaches using convex cones and lattices .",
    "this article is so well - written that there is no point in summarizing it here .",
    "instead , we turn to some problems with real and quaternionic quantum theory , which can be solved by treating them as part of a larger structure  the ` three - fold way'that also includes the complex theory .",
    "is complex quantum theory ` better ' than the real or quaternionic theories ?",
    "of course it fits the experimental data better .",
    "but people have also pointed to various internal problems , or at least unfamiliar aspects , of the real and quaternionic theories , as a way to justify nature s choice of the complex theory . here",
    "we describe two problems , both of which can be solved using the ` three - fold way ' . for more on the special virtues of complex quantum theory see hardy  @xcite and vicary  @xcite .",
    "one problem with real and quaternionic quantum theory is that the usual correspondence between strongly continuous one - parameter unitary groups and self - adjoint operators breaks down , or at least becomes more subtle . to see this with a minimum of distractions , _",
    "all hilbert spaces in this section will be assumed finite - dimensional_. the same issues show up in the infinite - dimensional case , but more technical detail is required to tell the story correctly .",
    "suppose @xmath63 is @xmath214 or @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath215 be @xmath63-hilbert spaces .",
    "we say an operator @xmath216 is * bounded * if there exists a constant @xmath217 such that @xmath218 for all @xmath197 .",
    "we define the * adjoint * of a bounded operator @xmath219 in the usual way : @xmath220 for all @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath223 , defined this way , really is an operator from @xmath215 back to @xmath6 .",
    "we define a @xmath63-linear operator @xmath224 to be * unitary * if @xmath225 . here",
    "we should warn the reader that when @xmath226 , the term ` orthogonal ' is often used instead of ` unitary'and when @xmath227 , people sometimes use the term ` symplectic ' . for us it will be more efficient to use the same word in all three cases .",
    "we define a * one - parameter unitary group * to be a family of unitary operators @xmath228 , one for each @xmath229 , such that @xmath230 for all @xmath231 .",
    "if @xmath6 is finite - dimensional , every one - parameter unitary group can be written as @xmath232 for a unique bounded operator @xmath210 .",
    "it is easy to check that the operator @xmath210 is * skew - adjoint * : it satisfies @xmath233 .",
    "in quantum theory we usually want our observables to be * self - adjoint * operators , obeying @xmath234 . and",
    "indeed , when @xmath235 , we can write any skew - adjoint operator @xmath210 in terms of a self - adjoint operator @xmath47 by setting @xmath236 this gives the usual correspondence between one - parameter unitary groups and self - adjoint operators .    alas , when @xmath226 we have no number @xmath23 , so we can not express our skew - adjoint @xmath210 in terms of a self - adjoint @xmath47 .",
    "nor can we do it when @xmath227 .",
    "now the problem is not a shortage of square roots of @xmath15 .",
    "instead , there are too many  and more importantly , they do not commute !",
    "we can try to set @xmath237 , but this operator @xmath47 will rarely be linear .",
    "the reason is that because @xmath210 commutes with multiplication by @xmath24 , @xmath47 anticommutes with multiplication by @xmath24 , so @xmath47 is only linear in the trivial case @xmath238 .",
    "later we shall see a workaround for this problem .",
    "a second problem , special to the quaternionic case , concerns tensoring hilbert spaces . in ordinary complex quantum theory ,",
    "when we have two systems , one with hilbert space @xmath6 and one with hilbert space @xmath215 , the system made by combining these two systems has hilbert space @xmath239 . here",
    "the tensor product of hilbert spaces relies on a more primitive concept : the tensor product of vector spaces .",
    "the tensor product of bimodules of a noncommutative algebra is another bimodule over that algebra .",
    "but a quaternionic vector space is not a bimodule : it is only a left module of the quaternions .",
    "so , the tensor product of quaternionic hilbert spaces is not naturally a quaternionic hilbert space .",
    "unfortunately , this issue is not addressed head - on in adler s book on quaternionic quantum theory  @xcite . when tensoring two quaternionic hilbert spaces , he essentially chooses a way to make one of them into a bimodule , without being very explicit about this .",
    "there is no canonical way to make a quaternionic hilbert space @xmath6 into a bimodule .",
    "indeed , given one way to do it , we can get many new ways as follows : @xmath240 where @xmath197 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 is an automorphism of the quaternions .",
    "every automorphism is of the form @xmath243 for some unit quaternion @xmath244 , so the automorphism group of the quaternions is @xmath245 .",
    "thus we can ` twist ' a bimodule structure on @xmath6 by any element of @xmath246 , obtaining a new bimodule with the same underlying quaternionic hilbert space .    in bartels work on quaternionic functional analysis , he used bimodules right from the start  @xcite .",
    "later ng  @xcite investigated these questions in more depth , and his paper provides a nice overview of many different approaches .",
    "here however we shall take a slightly different tack , noting that there is a way to make the tensor product of quaternionic hilbert spaces into a _ real _ hilbert space .",
    "this fits nicely into the thesis we wish to advocate : that real , complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics are not separate theories , but fit together as parts of a unified whole .",
    "some aspects of quantum theory become more visible when we introduce _",
    "symmetry_. this is especially true when it comes to the relation between real , complex and quaternionic quantum theory .",
    "so , instead of bare hilbert spaces , it is useful to consider hilbert spaces equipped with a representation of a group . for simplicity",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is a lie group , where we count a discrete group as a 0-dimensional lie group .",
    "let @xmath247 be the category where :    * an object is a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath6 equipped with a continuous unitary representation of @xmath5 , say @xmath248 . *",
    "a morphism is an operator @xmath216 such that @xmath249 for all @xmath10 .    to keep the notation simple",
    ", we often call a representation @xmath248 simply by the name of its underlying hilbert space , @xmath6 .",
    "another common convention , used in the introduction , is to call it @xmath16 .",
    "many of the operations that work for finite - dimensional hilbert spaces also work for @xmath247 , with the same formal properties : for example , direct sums , tensor products and duals .",
    "this lets us formulate the * three - fold way * as follows . if an object @xmath250 is * irreducible*not a direct sum of other representations in a nontrivial way ",
    "there are three mutually exclusive choices :    * the representation @xmath6 is not isomorphic to its dual . in this case",
    "we call it * complex*. * the representation @xmath6 is isomorphic to its dual and it is * real * : it arises from a representation of @xmath5 on a real hilbert space @xmath251 as follows : @xmath252 * the representation @xmath6 is isomorphic to its dual and it is * quaternionic * : it comes from a representation of @xmath5 on a quaternionic hilbert space @xmath253 with + @xmath254 the underlying complex representation of @xmath253    why",
    "? suppose that @xmath250 is irreducible .",
    "then there is a 1-dimensional space of morphisms @xmath255 , by schur s lemma .",
    "since @xmath256 , there is also a 1-dimensional space of morphisms @xmath257 , and thus a 1-dimensional space of morphisms @xmath258 we can also think of these as bilinear maps @xmath259 that are invariant under the action of @xmath5 on @xmath6 .",
    "but the representation @xmath260 is the direct sum of two others : the space @xmath261 of symmetric tensors , and the space @xmath262 of antisymmetric tensors : @xmath263 so , either there exists a nonzero @xmath244 that is * symmetric * : @xmath28 or a nonzero @xmath244 that is * antisymmetric * : @xmath264 one or the other , not both!for if we had both , the space of morphisms @xmath265 would be at least two - dimensional .    either way , we can write @xmath266 for some function @xmath267 .",
    "since @xmath244 and the inner product are both invariant under the action of @xmath5 , this function @xmath268 must commute with the action of @xmath5 .",
    "but note that since @xmath244 is linear in the first slot , while the inner product is not , @xmath268 must be * antilinear * , meaning @xmath269 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the square of an antilinear operator is linear .",
    "thus , @xmath270 is linear and it commutes with the action of @xmath5 . by schur s lemma , it must be a scalar multiple of the identity : @xmath271 for some @xmath272 .",
    "we wish to show that depending on whether @xmath244 is symmetric or antisymmetric , we can rescale @xmath268 to achieve either @xmath273 or @xmath274 . to see this , first note that depending on whether @xmath244 is symmetric or antisymmetric , we have @xmath275 and thus @xmath276 choosing @xmath277 , we thus have @xmath278 it follows that @xmath279 is a positive operator , so @xmath280 .",
    "thus , dividing @xmath268 by the positive square root of @xmath281 , we obtain a new antilinear operator  let us again call it @xmath268  with @xmath282 .",

    "since the operators @xmath287 , @xmath268 , and @xmath288 obey the usual quaternion relations , @xmath6 can be made into a quaternionic hilbert space @xmath253 .",
    "there is a representation of @xmath5 on @xmath253 whose underlying complex representation is @xmath6 .",
    "note that in both cases , @xmath244 is * nondegenerate * , meaning @xmath289 the reason is that @xmath290 , and the inner product is nondegenerate , while @xmath268 is one - to - one .",
    "we can describe real and quaternionic representations using either @xmath244 or @xmath268 . in the following statements",

    "there is one one irreducible representation for each ` spin ' @xmath295 .",
    "when @xmath24 is an integer , this representation describes the angular momentum states of a boson ; when @xmath24 is a half - integer ( meaning an integer plus @xmath20 ) it describes the angular momentum states of a fermion .",

    "the @xmath86th symmetrized tensor power , @xmath298 , is the spin-@xmath24 representation with @xmath299 . at this point",
    "a well - known general result will help :    [ tensor ] suppose @xmath5 is a lie group and @xmath300 . then :    * @xmath6 and @xmath215 are real @xmath301 @xmath239 is real .",
    "* @xmath6 is real and @xmath215 is quaternionic @xmath301 @xmath239 is quaternionic .",

    "@xmath6 and @xmath215 are quaternionic @xmath301 @xmath239 is real .    as we saw in the last section , @xmath6 is real ( resp .",
    "quaternionic ) if and only if it can be equipped with an invariant antiunitary operator @xmath302 with @xmath273 ( resp .",
    "@xmath274 ) .",
    "so , pick such an antiunitary @xmath268 for @xmath6 and also one @xmath303 for @xmath215 . then @xmath304 is an invariant antiunitary operator on @xmath305 , and @xmath306 this makes the result obvious .    in short ,",
    "the ` multiplication table ' for tensoring real and quaternionic representations is just like the multiplication table for the numbers @xmath13 and @xmath15and also , not coincidentally , just like the usual rule for combining bosons and fermions .",
    "next , note that any subrepresentation of a real representation is real , and any subrepresentation of a quaternionic representation is quaternionic .",
    "it follows that since the spin-@xmath20 representation of @xmath21 is quaternionic , its @xmath86th tensor power is real or quaternionic depending on whether @xmath86 is even or odd , and similarly for the subrepresentation @xmath298 .",
    "this is the spin-@xmath24 representation for @xmath299 .",
    "so , the spin-@xmath24 representation is real or quaternionic depending on whether @xmath24 is an integer or half - integer .",
    "but what is the physical meaning of the antiunitary operator @xmath268 on the spin-@xmath24 representation ?",

    "choose any element @xmath308 and let @xmath309 .",
    "then @xmath310 for all @xmath229 , and thus differentiating , we obtain @xmath311 but the operator @xmath210 is skew - adjoint . in quantum mechanics , we write @xmath312 where @xmath47 is the self - adjoint operator corresponding to angular momentum along some axis .",
    "since @xmath268 anticommutes with @xmath23 , we have @xmath313 so for every @xmath197 we have @xmath314 thus , the antiunitary operator @xmath268 reverses angular momentum .",
    "since the time - reversed version of a spinning particle is a particle spinning the opposite way , physicists call @xmath268 * time reversal*.    it seems natural that time reversal should obey @xmath273 , as it does in the bosonic case ; it may seem strange to have @xmath274 , as we do for fermions . should not applying time reversal twice",
    "get us back where we started ?",
    "it actually does , in a crucial sense : the expectation values of all observables are unchanged when we multiply a unit vector @xmath197 by @xmath15 .",
    "still , this minus sign reminds one of the equally curious minus sign that a fermion picks up when one rotates it a full turn .",
    "are these signs related ?",
    "the answer appears to be yes , though the following argument is more murky than we would like .",
    "it has its origins in feynman s 1986 dirac memorial lecture on antiparticles  @xcite , together with the well - known ` belt trick ' for demonstrating that @xmath246 fails to be simply connected ( which is the reason its double cover @xmath21 is needed to describe rotations in quantum theory . ) the argument uses string diagrams , which are a generalization of feynman diagrams . instead of explaining string diagrams here , we refer the reader to our prehistory of @xmath86-categorical physics  @xcite , and especially the section on freyd and yetter s 1986 paper on tangles .",
    "the basic ideas apply to any lie group @xmath5 . if an irreducible object @xmath250 is isomorphic to its dual",
    ", it comes with an invariant nondegenerate pairing @xmath265 .",
    "we can draw this as a ` cup ' : @xmath315 if this were a feynman diagram , it would depict two particles of type @xmath6 coming in on top and nothing going out at the bottom : since @xmath6 is isomorphic to its dual , particles of this type act like their own antiparticles , so they can annihilate each other .",
    "since @xmath244 defines an isomorphism @xmath256 , we get a morphism back from @xmath1 to @xmath260 , which we draw as a ` cap ' : @xmath316 uniquely determined by requiring that the cap and cup obey the _ zig - zag identities : _",
    "@xmath317 @xmath318 indeed , for any @xmath250 , we have a ` cup ' @xmath319 and ` cap ' @xmath320 obeying the zig - zag identities : in the language of category theory , we say that @xmath247 is compact closed  @xcite . when @xmath6 is isomorphic to its dual , we can write these using just @xmath6 .",
    "as we have seen , there are are two choices .",
    "if @xmath6 is real , @xmath244 is an orthogonal structure , and we can write the equation @xmath321 using string diagrams as follows : @xmath322 if @xmath6 is quaternionic , @xmath244 is a symplectic structure , and we can write the equation @xmath323 as follows : @xmath324    the power of string diagrams is that we can apply the same diagrammatic manipulation to both sides of an equation and get a valid new equation .",
    "so let us take the equations above , turn both sides @xmath325 clockwise , and stretch out the string a little .",
    "when @xmath6 is a real representation , we obtain : @xmath326 when @xmath6 is quaternionic we obtain : @xmath327 both sides of these equations describe morphisms from @xmath6 to itself .",
    "the vertical straight line at right corresponds to the identity morphism @xmath328 .",
    "the more complicated diagram at left turns out to correspond to the morphism @xmath270 .",
    "so , it follows that @xmath273 when the representation @xmath6 is real , while @xmath274 when @xmath6 is quaternionic .",
    "while it may seem puzzling to those who have not been initiated into the mysteries of string diagrams , everything so far can be made perfectly rigorous  @xcite .",
    "now comes the murky part .",
    "the string diagram at left : @xmath329 looks like a particle turning back in time , going backwards for a while , and then turning yet again and continuing forwards in time . in other words , it _ looks like a picture of the square of time reversal ! _ so , the fact that the corresponding morphism @xmath270 is indeed the square of time reversal when @xmath294 somehow seems right .",
    "moreover , in the theory of string diagrams it is often useful to draw the strings as ` ribbons ' .",
    "this allows us to take the diagram at left and pull it tight , as follows : @xmath33{ribbon1.eps } } ;   \\endxy \\qquad = \\qquad   \\xy   ( 0,0)*{\\includegraphics[angle=180,scale=0.5]{ribbon2.eps } } ;   \\endxy\\ ] ] at left we have a particle ( or actually a small piece of string ) turning around in _ time _",
    ", while at right we have a particle making a full turn in _ space _ as time passes .",
    "so , in the case @xmath294 it seems to make sense that @xmath273 when the spin @xmath24 is an integer : after all , the state vector of an integer - spin particle is unchanged when we rotate that particle a full turn .",
    "similarly , it seems to make sense that @xmath274 when @xmath24 is a half - integer : the state vector of a half - integer - spin particle gets multiplied by @xmath15 when we rotate it by a full turn .",
    "so , we seem to be on the brink of having a ` picture proof ' that the square of time reversal must match the result of turning a particle 360 degrees .",
    "unfortunately this argument is not yet rigorous , since we have not explained how the topology of ribbon diagrams ( well - known in category theory ) is connected to the geometry of rotations and time reversal . perhaps understanding the argument better would lead us to new insights .    while our discussion here focused on the group @xmath21 , real and quaternionic representations of other groups",
    "are also important in physics .",
    "for example , gauge bosons live in the adjoint representation of a compact lie group @xmath5 on the complexification of its own lie algebra ; since the lie algebra is real , this is always a real representation of @xmath5 .",
    "this is related to the fact that gauge bosons are their own antiparticles . in the standard model , fermions are not their own antiparticles , but in some theories they can be . among other things",
    ", this involves the question of whether the relevant spinor representations of the groups @xmath330 are complex , real ( ` majorana spinors ' ) or quaternionic ( ` pseudo - majorana spinors ' ) .",
    "the options are well - understood , and follow a nice pattern depending on the dimension and signature of spacetime modulo 8  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the spin groups @xmath330 are not compact unless @xmath331 or @xmath332 , so their finite - dimensional complex representations are hardly ever unitary , and most of the results mentioned in this paper do not apply .",
    "nonetheless , we may ask if such a representation is the complexification of a real one , or the underlying complex representation of a quaternionic one  and the answers have implications for physics .",
    "@xmath21 is not the only compact lie group with the property that all its irreducible continuous unitary representations on complex hilbert spaces are real or quaternionic . for a group to have this property",
    ", it is necessary and sufficient that every element be conjugate to its inverse .",
    "all compact simple lie groups have this property except those of type @xmath333 for @xmath334 , @xmath335 with @xmath86 odd , and @xmath336 ( see bourbaki  @xcite ) . for the symmetric groups @xmath337 , the orthogonal groups @xmath338 , and the special orthogonal groups @xmath339 for @xmath106 , all representations are in fact real",
    "so , there is a rich supply of real and quaternionic group representations , which leave their indelible mark on physics even when we are doing complex quantum theory .",
    "as discussed so far , the three - fold way describes how certain complex representations of groups can be seen as arising from real or quaternionic representations .",
    "this gives a sense in which ordinary complex quantum theory subsumes the real and quaternionic theories .",
    "but underlying this idea is something simpler yet deeper , which arises at the level of hilbert spaces , even before group representations enter the game .",
    "suppose @xmath63 is either @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and let @xmath340 be the category where :    * an object is a @xmath63-hilbert space ; * a morphism is a bounded @xmath63-linear operator .",
    "as we shall see , any one of the categories @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 has a faithful functor to any other .",
    "this means that a hilbert space over any one of the three normed division algebras can be seen as hilbert space over any other , equipped with some extra structure !    at the bottom of this fact lies the chain of inclusions @xmath341 thanks to these , any complex vector space has an underlying real vector space , and any quaternionic vector space has underlying complex vector space .",
    "the same is true for hilbert spaces . to make the underlying real vector space of a complex hilbert space into a real hilbert space ,",
    "we take the real part of the original complex inner product .",
    "this is well - known ; a bit less familiar is how the underlying complex vector space of a quaternionic hilbert space becomes a complex hilbert space .",
    "here we need to take the * complex part * of the original quaternionic inner product , defined by @xmath342 one can check that these constructions give functors @xmath343    a bit more formally , we have a commutative triangle of homomorphisms : @xmath344_{\\alpha } \\ar[rr]^{\\gamma } & & { { \\mathbb h}}\\\\ & { { \\mathbb c}}\\ar[ur]_{\\beta } } \\ ] ] there is only one choice of the homomorphisms @xmath242 and @xmath345 .",
    "there are many choices of @xmath346 , since we can map @xmath347 to any square root of @xmath15 in the quaternions .",
    "however , all the various choices of @xmath346 are the same up to an automorphism of the quaternions .",
    "that is , given two homomorphisms @xmath348 , we can always find an automorphism @xmath349 such that @xmath350 .",
    "so , nothing important depends on the choice of @xmath346 .",
    "let us make a choice  say the standard one , with @xmath351and use that .",
    "this commutative triangle gives a commutative triangle of functors : @xmath352^{\\beta^ * } \\ar[ll]_{\\gamma^ * } \\\\ & { { \\rm hilb}}_{{{\\mathbb c } } } \\ar[ul]^{\\alpha^ * } } \\ ] ]    now , recall that a functor @xmath353 is * faithful * if given two morphisms @xmath354 in @xmath167 , @xmath355 implies that @xmath356 .",
    "when @xmath353 is faithful , we can think of objects of @xmath167 as objects of @xmath357 equipped with extra structure .",
    "it is easy to see that the functors @xmath358 and @xmath359 are all faithful .",
    "this lets us describe hilbert spaces for a larger normed division algebra as hilbert spaces _ equipped with extra structure _ for a smaller normed division algebra .",
    "none of this particularly new or difficult : the key ideas are all in adams book on lie groups  @xcite .",
    "however , it sheds light on how real , complex and quaternionic quantum theory are related .",

    "this extra structure @xmath268 is often called a * quaternionic structure*. we have seen it already in our study of the three - fold way .",
    "it comes from our ability to multiply by @xmath24 in a quaternionic hilbert space .    finally , we consider the extra structure possessed by the underlying real hilbert space of a quaternionic hilbert space .",
    "this can be understood by composing the previous two theorems :    the functor @xmath367 is faithful , and @xmath37 is equivalent to the category where :    * an object is a real hilbert space @xmath6 equipped with two unitary operators @xmath368 with @xmath369 and @xmath370 ; * a morphism @xmath216 is a bounded real - linear operator preserving this extra structure : @xmath361 and @xmath371 .",

    "this lets us describe hilbert spaces for a smaller normed division algebra in terms of hilbert spaces for a larger one .",

    "a more category - theoretic treatment of symplectic and orthogonal structures can be found in our old paper on 2-hilbert spaces  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ problems ] we raised two ` problems ' with real and quaternionic quantum theory . let us conclude by saying how the three - fold way solves these .",
    "we noted that on a real , complex or quaternionic hilbert space , any continuous one - parameter unitary group has a skew - adjoint generator @xmath210 . in the complex case",
    "we can write @xmath210 as @xmath23 times a self - adjoint operator @xmath47 , which in physics describes a real - valued observable .",
    "the first ` problem ' is that in the real or quaternionic cases we can not do this .",
    "however , now we know from theorems [ quaternionic_as_complex ] and [ real_as_complex ] that real and quaternionic hilbert spaces can be seen as a complex hilbert space with extra structure .",
    "this solves the problem .",
    "indeed , we have faithful functors @xmath407 and @xmath408 as noted in the previous section , these are ` dagger - functors ' , so they send skew - adjoint operators to skew - adjoint operators .",
    "so , given a skew - adjoint operator @xmath210 on a real hilbert space @xmath6 , we can apply the functor @xmath382 to reinterpret it as a skew - adjoint operator on the complexification of @xmath6 , namely @xmath409 . by abuse of notation",
    "let us still call the resulting operator @xmath210 .",
    "now we can write @xmath312 .",
    "but the resulting self - adjoint operator @xmath47 has an interesting feature : its spectrum is symmetric about @xmath14 !    in the finite - dimensional case ,",
    "all this means is that for any eigenvector of @xmath47 with eigenvalue @xmath410 , there is corresponding eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath411 .",
    "this is easy to see .",
    "suppose that @xmath412 . by theorem [ real_as_complex ] ,",
    "the complexification @xmath409 comes equipped with an antiunitary operator @xmath268 with @xmath273 , and we have @xmath413 .",
    "it follows that @xmath414 is an eigenvector of @xmath47 with eigenvalue @xmath411 : @xmath415 ( in this calculation we have reverted to the standard practice of treating a complex hilbert space as a _ left _ @xmath1-module . ) in the infinite - dimensional case , we can make an analogous but more subtle statement about the continuous spectrum .",
    "similarly , given a skew - adjoint operator @xmath210 on a quaternionic hilbert space @xmath6 , we can apply the functor @xmath416 to reinterpret it as a skew - adjoint operator on the underlying complex hilbert space .",
    "let us again call the resulting operator @xmath210 . we again can write @xmath312 . and",
    "again , the spectrum of @xmath47 is symmetric about @xmath14 .",
    "the proof is the same as in the real case : now , by theorem [ quaternionic_as_complex ] , the underlying complex hilbert space is equipped with an antiunitary operator @xmath268 with @xmath274 , but we again have @xmath413 , so the same calculation goes through .",
    "the second ` problem ' is that we can not take the tensor product of two quaternionic hilbert spaces and get another quaternionic hilbert spaces .",
    "but theorem [ tensor ] makes this seem like an odd thing to want !",
    "just as two fermions make a boson , the tensor product of two quaternionic hilbert spaces is naturally a _ real _ hilbert space .",
    "after all , theorem [ quaternionic_as_complex ] says that a quaternionic hilbert space can be identified with a complex hilbert space with an antiunitary @xmath268 such that @xmath274 .",
    "if we tensor two such spaces , we get a complex hilbert space equipped with an antiunitary @xmath268 such that that @xmath273 .",
    "theorem [ real_as_complex ] then says that this can be identified with a real hilbert space .",
    "further arguments of this sort give four tensor product functors : @xmath417 we can also tensor a real or quaternionic hilbert space with a complex one and get a complex one : @xmath418 finally , of course we have : @xmath419 in short , the ` multiplication ' table of real , complex and quaternionic hilbert spaces matches the usual multiplication table for the numbers @xmath420 .",

    "<S> quantum theory may be formulated using hilbert spaces over any of the three associative normed division algebras : the real numbers , the complex numbers and the quaternions . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> these three choices appear naturally in a number of axiomatic approaches . however , there are internal problems with real or quaternionic quantum theory . here </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these problems can be resolved if we treat real , complex and quaternionic quantum theory as part of a unified structure . </S>",
    "<S> dyson called this structure the ` three - fold way ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps easiest to see it in the study of irreducible unitary representations of groups on complex hilbert spaces . </S>",
    "<S> these representations come in three kinds : those that are not isomorphic to their own dual ( the truly ` complex ' representations ) , those that are self - dual thanks to a symmetric bilinear pairing ( which are ` real ' , in that they are the complexifications of representations on real hilbert spaces ) , and those that are self - dual thanks to an antisymmetric bilinear pairing ( which are ` quaternionic ' , in that they are the underlying complex representations of representations on quaternionic hilbert spaces ) . </S>",
    "<S> this three - fold classification sheds light on the physics of time reversal symmetry , and it already plays an important role in particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , hilbert spaces of any one of the three kinds  real , complex and quaternionic  can be seen as hilbert spaces of the other kinds , equipped with extra structure .    </S>",
