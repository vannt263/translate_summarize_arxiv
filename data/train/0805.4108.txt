    "the observation of events with a missing mass consisting of 2 , 3 and 4 @xmath3 particles in the @xmath4+@xmath5 , @xmath6+@xmath5 and @xmath5+@xmath7 reactions @xcite and the observation of the @xmath3 and @xmath8 emission in ternary cold neutronless spontaneous fission of @xmath9 @xcite have renewed interested in investigating the ternary fission mode @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ternary @xmath3 emission has been detected recently during the fission of the rotating compound nucleus @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal ternary fission has been investigated previously using a family of compact and creviced shapes , or quasi - molecular elongated shapes , leading to the emission of a light fragment between two equal heavier fragments keeping a symmetry plane perpendicular to the fission axis @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the approach is extended to the longitudinal ternary fission with emission of three different aligned fragments and is applied to several nuclei investigated experimentally .",
    "the deformation energy is always calculated within a liquid drop model taking into account the nuclear proximity energy resulting from the strong interaction between the surfaces in regard in the crevices of the one - body strongly deformed configuration or the necks between the separated fragments .",
    "+   +   +    for a deformed nucleus , the macroscopic energy is defined as @xmath11 for one - body shapes the volume , surface and coulomb energies are defined as : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 is the surface of the one - body deformed nucleus .",
    "@xmath16 is the electrostatic potential at the surface and @xmath17 the surface potential of the sphere .    for three - body shapes ,",
    "the volume , surface and coulomb energies are the sum of the contributions of each fragment and the coulomb interaction energy is added .",
    "the rotational energy is determined within the rigid - body ansatz : @xmath18 the surface energy results from the effects of the surface tension forces in a half space . when there are nucleons in regard in a neck or a gap between separated fragments an additional proximity energy must be added to take into account the effects of the nuclear forces between the close surfaces .",
    "this term is essential to describe smoothly the one - body to two - body transition and to obtain reasonable fusion barrier and @xmath3 decay barrier heights .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance varying from the neck radius or zero to the height of the neck border .",
    "@xmath21 is the distance between the surfaces in regard and @xmath22  fm the surface width .",
    "@xmath23 is the proximity function .",
    "the surface parameter @xmath24 is the geometric mean between the surface parameters of the two nuclei or fragments .",
    "the coulomb , surface and nuclear proximity energies contributing to the ternary fission barrier of @xmath9 are displayed in figure 1 for a specific exit channel .",
    "the surface and proximity energy slopes change drastically at the contact point between the nascent fragments but the total energy varies smoothly as well as the coulomb energy .",
    "the potential barriers governing the ternary fission of @xmath25 leading to the @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath7 emission are given in figures 2 , 3 and 4 as functions of the angular momentum .",
    "the barrier top corresponds always to three or two separated spherical aligned fragments maintained in unstable equilibrium by the balance between the attractive nuclear proximity forces and the repulsive coulomb forces .",
    "the position of the barrier is much more external in the ternary decay path than in the binary one since the elongation is larger . the proximity energy is higher in the ternary fission path since there are two necks . for the ternary @xmath3 emission and at @xmath28",
    "the ternary fission is not competitive with respect to binary fission .",
    "the asymmetric binary fission is favoured . with increasing angular momentum",
    "the situation is reversed and the most asymmetric ternary fission may play an important role .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for the 2 @xmath3 emission even though the lowering of the ternary fission is weaker . a deep minimum exists in the @xmath29 exit channel at @xmath30 and the transition to an asymmetric ternary decay channel seems possible .",
    "the @xmath7 emission at @xmath30 appears also possible in an asymmetric ternary decay .",
    "then , at the highest angular momenta , the more negative q value for the ternary fission can be compensated for the smaller value of the rotational energy at the saddle point which occurs at larger distances .",
    "the same behaviour is observed for the @xmath6 nucleus .",
    "the fission barrier heights of the @xmath25 nucleus and the moment of inertia at the top of the barrier are given in the table 1 .",
    "the moment of inertia in the ternary decay is roughly twice larger than in the binary decay channel .",
    "the moment of inertia increases with the symmetry of the reaction .",
    "the moment of inertia diminishes when the angular momenta increases since the barrier top moves slightly to an inner position .",
