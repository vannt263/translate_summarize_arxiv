    "massive o - type stars , including the progenitors of wolf - rayet stars , inject enormous quantities of energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the form of dissociating and ionizing radiation and winds .",
    "the radiation fields create circumstellar / interstellar and regions into which winds blow , creating large - scale swept - up expanding shells of gas known as stellar wind bubbles @xcite .",
    "there are numerous analytical and numerical studies of the formation , structure , and evolution of stellar wind bubbles ( swbs ) , but there are few convincing observations of bubbles around wolf - rayet stars and massive o - stars .",
    "the viith catalogue of galactic wolf - rayet stars indicates that only @xmath0 are associated with bubbles @xcite .",
    "surveys are incomplete , but many of these proposed bubbles are not securely established .    the interstellar environment of massive stars is observed to be extremely complex and is likely to be the combined result of inhomogeneous initial conditions and the influence of the stars .",
    "our understanding of the physics of astrophysical flows in inhomogeneous media is incomplete @xcite . in particular the effects of conduction , diffusion ,",
    "turbulence , magnetism , and of mixing and mass - loading processes are all poorly understood .",
    "therefore , in the observational study of swbs and the environment of massive stars it is important to remain open to the possibility of phenomena not predicted by standard swb models .    in this paper",
    "we present one possible example of such a phenomenon .",
    "we investigate the nature of a large - scale system of neutral atomic hydrogen filaments which apparently emanate from compact molecular clouds located in or near the perseus arm of our galaxy .",
    "we investigate the possibility that these `` tails '' are the result of molecular cloud mass - loading within the wind flow of massive stars .",
    "the observations and data processing are briefly outlined in the next section .",
    "section  [ sect : results ] describes the observational results . in section  [ sec : driving_srcs ] we consider possible driving sources , and in section  [ sec : environ ] we take a closer look at the environment of the two main candidates .",
    "the discussion follows (  [ sec : discuss ] ) , in which we first consider the kinematics and timescales involved (  [ sec : kin_time ] ) , and then present an analysis within the framework of a mass - loaded flow model (  [ sec : mass - loaded ] ) .",
    "our conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the data discussed in this paper were obtained as part of the canadian galactic plane survey , a long - term multi - wavelength imaging survey of the ism of the northern galactic plane @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : cgps_param ] summarizes the main parameters of the relevant cgps data .",
    "the principal observational components of the cgps are arcminute resolution mosaics of 21  cm ( in all stokes parameters ) and 74  cm ( right hand circular polarization ) radio continuum , and 21  cm line emission , all observed with the synthesis telescope @xcite at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory of the herzberg institute of astrophysics .",
    "complementary data produced as part of the cgps include mosaics of dust emission created using hires - processed iras data @xcite and of @xmath1co(@xmath2 ) emission from the fcrao outer galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "the cgps co mosaics are the result of a reprocessing of the original ogs data , wherein correlated noise between pixels caused by the observing method was suppressed , and faint contaminating emission found in the reference positions of the survey was removed @xcite .",
    "the reprocessed data were resampled and projected into the cgps mosaic system .",
    "a mean brightness temperature image , averaged between lsr radial velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4  , is shown in figure  [ fig : mean_tb_hi ] .",
    "prominent in this image is a linear structure @xmath5 long , running at an angle @xmath6 north of west relative to the galactic plane . in the extreme southeast",
    "this structure is a relatively narrow ( @xmath7 wide ) filament beginning near @xmath8 . near @xmath9 ,",
    "the narrow filament is joined by a broader ( @xmath10 ) structure which runs parallel and to the south of it . this structure continues to broaden towards the northwest , reaching a maximum width of @xmath11 .",
    "its northwest extremity lies near @xmath12 , where it blends into larger scale structures in the galactic plane .",
    "the approximate centre of the linear structure is at @xmath13 ; we designate it hi  g137.7@xmath141.6@xmath1460 , and for brevity refer to it as hi  g137 in this paper .",
    "the radial velocity width of hi  g137 is @xmath15  , and there is a distinct velocity gradient along its length : velocities become more negative towards the northwest .",
    "this velocity gradient clearly separates hi  g137 from the galactic emission to the northwest ( figure  [ fig : vel_gradient ] ) .",
    "individual channel maps ( figure  [ fig : channel_maps ] ) hint at the existence of linear substructures , resulting in the overall impression that hi  g137 is composed of several parallel filaments .",
    "we can detect no clear velocity structure in the direction transverse to the length of the filaments : this may be due to a combination of sensitivity and angular resolution limitations for individual filaments and confusion between them .",
    "we are unable to make a direct measurement of the distance to hi  g137 . there are no known regions in the direction of the filaments , and there are large discrepancies between kinematic and photometric distances in the galactic plane in this region in the sense that kinematic distances can be greatly over - estimated compared to the latter @xcite .",
    "the cgps co data were searched for molecular clouds having positional and/or velocity coincidences with hi  g137 .",
    "we found no co emission near hi  g137 within the velocity range of the structure . widening",
    "the velocity range of our search revealed an irregular chain of co clouds in the southeast of hi  g137 at @xmath16   extending @xmath17 in a direction perpendicular to the length of the structure .",
    "of these , the cloud with the brightest peak co line brightness ( @xmath18  k ) , which we dub co  g138.1@xmath141.9@xmath1448 ( co  g138 for brevity ) , lies at the convergence point of the broad - structured component of hi  g137 ( figure  [ fig : co_clouds ] ) . the velocity difference between co  g138 and hi  g137 ranges between 5 and 20  .",
    "the northern narrow filament of hi  g137 appears to emerge from between a gap in the chain of co clouds . within this gap",
    "there is a faint ( 1.3  k ) compact cloudlet at @xmath19   embedded within very faint ( @xmath20  k ) diffuse co emission .",
    "the positional association between molecular clouds and the convergent point of the filaments suggests that hi  g137 might be the result of a directed flow of dissociated gas from the molecular clouds .",
    "if hi  g137 is associated with the co clouds at @xmath21  , its distance is @xmath22  kpc , the approximate distance to the perseus arm at this longitude .",
    "the source(s ) of the radiation and/or winds driving hi  g137 will be at the same distance .",
    "the former would have to be located on the sky such that the filaments point towards them and the co clumps lie between them and the filaments in a more or less collinear fashion .",
    "the simbad database was used to search for o , b , and wolf - rayet type stars within @xmath23 of @xmath24 ( table  [ tbl : stars ] ) . of the resulting ten stars ,",
    "the wolf - rayet star wr  5 and the o - type supergiant hd  17603 currently have substantial stellar winds and ionizing radiation .",
    "these two therefore merit closest attention .",
    "wr  5 ( hd  17638 ) is a wolf - rayet star of spectral type wc6 @xcite .",
    "it has a reddening of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and a photometrically derived distance of 1.91  kpc @xcite .",
    "hd  17603 is an o7.5ib(f ) star @xcite located @xmath27 northwest of wr  5 .",
    "stars of type o(f ) are thought to be precursors of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the available ubv photometry for this star @xcite is consistent with a reddening @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of of stars are not well determined : however assuming that this star has @xmath30 @xcite , it lies at a distance @xmath31  kpc .",
    "both wr  5 and hd  17603 satisfy the positional criteria to be considered candidate driving sources .",
    "in addition , both are hot , luminous objects with strong winds . for both stars ,",
    "the apparent alignment of @xmath14co@xmath14star is very good , and these stars are likely to be the most luminous and energetic of those we have identified .",
    "finally , their approximate distances are consistent with that proposed for hi  g137 .",
    "stellar wind parameters for both stars are listed in table  [ tbl : wr5_hd17603 ] .",
    "a final consistency check on the stellar and co cloud distances can be made by integrating the line profiles towards the stars from zero velocity to the velocity where an column corresponding to @xmath32 is found . for the wr  5 and hd  17603 sight lines ,",
    "reddening implies an column of @xmath33  .",
    "our data shows that this column density is reached when the line profiles are integrated from zero velocity out to @xmath34  , consistent with the radial velocity of co  g138 .",
    "in addition to the wolf - rayet and oib(f ) star discussed above , there are eight b stars within @xmath10 of the tip of hi  g137 . among them",
    "is eo  per , a rapidly varying b0 supergiant .",
    "a b0 supergiant has a mass of roughly 30   and so was approximately type o7.5 while on the main sequence .",
    "according to @xcite , such a star has a wind terminal velocity of 2300  , slightly lower than the lower bound quoted for both wr  5 and hd  17603 , and a mass loss rate of @xmath35  , an order of magnitude smaller than the lower bound for the other two stars . at present",
    "this star is likely to have a higher mass loss rate but much lower wind terminal velocity than wr  5 and hd  17603 , as well as a lower ionizing flux .",
    "the remaining seven candidates have very limited observational data upon which to base determination of their type and distance . if we assume they are located at @xmath36  kpc and lie behind extinction of @xmath29 , then all these stars have photometry roughly consistent with early b type stars on the main sequence , although we can not rule out the possibility that some are actually o type stars .",
    "based on low resolution ( @xmath37 ) observations , @xcite proposed that wr  5 is associated with an ovoidal deficiency , interpreted as a cavity , at velocities around @xmath38  .",
    "we note that integrating out to @xmath38   in the line yields a column density only @xmath39  , corresponding to @xmath40 , which is too small to be consistent with the observed reddening to the two stars .",
    "wr  5 and hd  17603 are well beyond the distance corresponding to that gas velocity and thus can not be associated with the ovoidal structure . our high resolution ( @xmath41 )",
    "observations show that the distribution is highly structured in both morphology and velocity , and the `` cavity '' is by no means clearly distinguishable .",
    "in addition , regions of depressed brightness within this `` cavity '' correspond in position and velocity with much of the co emission seen around @xmath38  , which suggests that the relative lack of emission is due at least in part to the hydrogen being in molecular rather than atomic form .    for the velocity range within which we associate wr  5 and hd  17603 ( @xmath42 ) , our data do not show any convincing evidence for an shell surrounding a cavity .",
    "however , it is possible that a gas shell does exist but is not clearly visible in the observations because of its low contrast or because parts of it are molecular .",
    "the clear anti - correlation between the co clouds and the brightness distribution in the @xmath43 to @xmath44 velocity range and the relative lack of co emission within @xmath45 of the stars lend some support to the latter possibility .",
    "@xcite cited evidence from iras skyflux images for a @xmath46-diameter dust shell around wr  5 .",
    "such a shell is not obvious in the hires processed 12 , 25 , 60 , and @xmath47 m mosaics . to investigate",
    "further , we used the 60 and @xmath47 m data to produce dust temperature and optical depth images .",
    "the scattered dust concentrations interpreted by marston as a shell correlate much better with the velocity - integrated co data than with the velocity - integrated data , some with co emission in the velocity range around @xmath38   and others with the co around @xmath48  .",
    "this suggests that what was interpreted as a shell is in fact the result of projection effects .",
    "we inspected data for this region from the virginia tech spectral - line survey @xcite and the wisconsin h - alpha mapper @xcite northern sky survey .",
    "the vtss has an angular resolution of @xmath49 but does not provide velocity information .",
    "the wham data has a velocity resolution of @xmath50   but a lower angular resolution @xmath51 .",
    "the vtss data suggest that wr  5 and hd  17603 both lie within a region relatively devoid of emission .",
    "the morphology of this `` void '' and thus its possible association with the stars is uncertain because a comparison of the vtss image with velocity - integrated co emission suggests that absorption by the dust in molecular clouds strongly influences the observed brightness distribution .",
    "we conclude that there is at present no conclusive evidence for an or dust shell / cavity structure around wr  5 or hd  17603 , although the stars appear to lie in regions relatively free of molecular , neutral atomic , and ionized gas .",
    "any gas shell surrounding this region would have to be of low contrast or be rather inhomogeneous in its composition and structure : the latter implies a `` leaky '' shell within which a hot wind bubble might not be maintained .",
    "the morphological relationships between the tails , the co clouds , and the stars raises the question of whether all these are physically related .",
    "the possibility of a simple coincidence can not be ruled out , but an explanation for the morphology and velocity structure of the tails would still be needed . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility that winds from massive stars could be responsible for driving long narrow tails from compact molecular clouds in their vicinity .    a viable physical model of hi",
    "g137 must be consistent with all of the observational data we have presented above .",
    "obviously , we need a stellar mechanism for converting molecular to neutral atomic hydrogen and accelerating the away from the molecular clumps in long narrow tails at a velocity of @xmath52  .",
    "wr  5 and/or hd  17603 must be able to supply momentum and energy at the rates required over a time comparable to the dynamical timescale .",
    "the molecular clumps must also be able to survive within the environment of the star(s ) for this time .",
    "one question that immediately arises is the association of tails with only some of the co clouds in the @xmath16   velocity range .",
    "standard galactic rotation curves predict a slope of the distance@xmath14velocity relationship at this location in the galaxy of @xmath53  .",
    "the above velocity range thus potentially covers a line of sight range of @xmath54   and the velocity resolution of our co data ( @xmath55  ) corresponds to @xmath53  .",
    "the empirical rotation curve of @xcite suggests the slope may be even steeper .",
    "given the potentially very wide range of distances for the co clouds , only a small subset of the observed clouds may be within the range of influence of the tail - driving source(s ) .",
    "additionally , flows from other co clouds may be subject to confusion if they have relatively low radial velocities .",
    "determining the mass of extended structures is always subject to wide uncertainties , not least because of confusion with unrelated emission .",
    "this is particularly acute for structures having large velocity dispersions .",
    "we determined the mass of hi  g137 by first removing an estimate of the background emission on a channel - by - channel basis .",
    "this background was calculated by a linear interpolation anchored to velocity channels bracketing the velocity range of hi  g137 which were judged to be free of emission from the latter .",
    "the background subtracted cube was then integrated over a polygonal region enclosing hi  g137 .",
    "the solid angle of this region was 1.1 square degrees , and the mean column density derived was @xmath56 .",
    "the total mass is @xmath57   and the total mass , assuming a hydrogen mass fraction of 0.77 , is @xmath58  .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass estimate is at least @xmath59 .",
    "the physical length of hi  g137 projected onto the plane of the sky is @xmath60  pc .    assuming @xmath61  kpc for hi  g137 , this yields a total mass of the structure of @xmath62  g. assuming a systemic radial velocity of the mass reservoir of @xmath19  , the linear momentum contained in hi  g137 is @xmath63  , where we have assumed that the space velocity of the flow can be deprojected from the radial velocity by using an inclination angle to the line of sight @xmath64 .",
    "the mass - weighted mean outflow velocity is then @xmath65  , and the kinetic energy is @xmath66  erg .",
    "the driving source(s ) presumably have injected momentum and energy isotropically into the ism .",
    "the observed opening angle of hi  g137 is @xmath67 : assuming that the three dimensional structure is conical and viewed at an inclination @xmath64 , the true opening angle is @xmath68 , and hi  g137 subtends a fraction @xmath69 of a sphere .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 ( @xmath71  ster ) , the maximum value occurring when @xmath72 ( when the outflow axis lies in the plane of the sky ) . over the lifetime of hi  g137 ( discussed below ) , the driving source(s ) have supplied a total ( isotropic ) momentum and kinetic energy of , respectively , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where the @xmath75 factors represent the efficiency of the transfer of momentum and energy to the .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath76 and @xmath77 is obtained by minimizing the following two expressions with respect to @xmath64 : @xmath78 @xmath79    for @xmath80 , the minimum values are @xmath81   ( when @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83  erg ( when @xmath84 ) . a simple conical outflow model yields for the flow timescale @xmath85  yr , where we have used the mass - weighted mean outflow radial velocity @xmath86   and the mass - weighted mean angular extent @xmath87 .",
    "we have noted above the presence of a strong uniform radial velocity gradient along the tails . if this were a manifestation of velocity - sorting rather than continuous acceleration , @xmath88 might be more accurately estimated by using the maximum outflow radial velocity observed ( @xmath89  ) rather than the mean velocity , resulting in a factor of 2 decrease in @xmath88 .",
    "we will argue below that the velocity gradient is more likely to be the result of a steady acceleration of the tails , in which case the use of the mean velocity is approximately correct .    using the dynamical timescale we can estimate the rate at which the driving source(s ) deliver ( isotropically ) momentum and kinetic energy , respectively @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the minimum values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are obtained by minimizing the two following expressions with respect to @xmath64 : @xmath92    @xmath93    we find @xmath94   ( when @xmath95 ) , and @xmath96   ( when @xmath97 )",
    ". figure  [ fig : dep_on_i ] shows plots of the dependence of @xmath76 , @xmath90 , @xmath77 , and @xmath91 on @xmath64 for the simple conical flow model .",
    "the uncertainty in the values of the kinematic and energetic parameters is dominated by our lack of knowledge of the inclination angle , affecting in particular the value of the kinematic timescale . in our discussions below",
    "we will assume that @xmath64 most likely lies within the range @xmath98 .",
    "our estimates of the physical parameters of the tails are summarized in table  [ tbl : tail_param ] .",
    "the lowest velocity shift discernable between the co and , limited by background confusion , is @xmath99  , which is roughly comparable to the sound speed in neutral atomic hydrogen .",
    "the systematic radial velocity gradient of hi  g137 could be interpreted in terms of curvature along the line of sight or of expansion . however",
    ", if hi  g137 is the result of a flow from the co clouds , it is reasonable to assume that the filaments are radially directed away from the driving source and are thus approximately linear .",
    "the velocity gradient would then reflect a continuous acceleration of gas along the filaments , leading to the picture of a flow embedded within an extended wind region .",
    "this picture of long flowing tails from dense clouds driven by an external wind is similar to the situation described analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite of the quasi - steady hydrodynamic mixing and entrainment of dense clump gas by a diffuse subsonic or transsonic wind .",
    "we propose that the neutral atomic tails are created in the dissociation and entrainment of molecular clouds enveloped within a strong stellar wind or winds .",
    "the wind ablates and entrains cloud gas and accelerates it away from the cloud in long narrow tails as a mass - loaded flow . given the positional associations noted above , the source of the wind(s ) is likely to be in the vicinity of wr  5 and hd  17603 .",
    "we note that it is very unlikely that these filaments are cometary tails caused by shadowing of radiation in a low - density region .",
    "the flaring of the tails away from the axis of symmetry with increasing distance from the apex is inconsistent with observations @xcite and models @xcite of cometary clouds .",
    "the dynamical timescale of hi  g137 , a few million years , is far longer than the timescale for complete photoionization of the tails @xcite . this leaves the wind - driven model , but in order to establish the plausibility of this model there are several questions which must be addressed .",
    "can the molecular clouds survive a few million years inside a stellar wind region ? what must be the conditions inside this region in order to account for the observed cloud mass loss rate and entrained gas acceleration , and how realistic are they ?",
    "are the energetics plausible ?",
    "what are the mechanisms by which the entrained gas may be dissociated ?",
    "we address these questions in the following sections .      for the proposed model to be feasible , the molecular clouds must survive their initial impact with the stellar wind , before settling down to a quasi - steady entrainment phase within the wind .",
    "@xcite have performed an analytic and numerical study of the interaction between a fast , steady , planar shock and a dense isothermal , nonmagnetic , spherical , cold cloud .",
    "more recently , @xcite have extended numerical studies to the case of shocks encountering multiple clouds in which cloud - cloud interactions can oocur . as summarized in both these papers ( we follow the formulation of @xcite in this paper ) ,",
    "a key timescale is the `` cloud - crushing time '' @xmath100 , which is the time required for the internally transmitted shock to cross the cloud , @xmath101 . here",
    "@xmath102 is the initial cloud radius and @xmath103 , the forward velocity of the shock through the cloud , is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ratio of the pressure just behind the cloud shock to that at the stagnation point and @xmath106 is the ratio of the pressure at the stagnation point to that in the far upstream wind .",
    "both these quantities have values of roughly unity @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the external shock is @xmath107 and the density contrast @xmath108 is the ratio of the initial cloud density to that of the external medium . in the numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite , the cloud destruction time @xmath109 ( defined as the time at which the mass of the surviving cloud core is reduced to @xmath20 of its initial value )",
    "was typically found to be @xmath110 .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite suggest values of @xmath111 with the inclusion of dynamically significant magnetic fields .",
    "the molecular clouds at the apex of the tails have a total mass @xmath112  .",
    "their current radii are @xmath113   and they have h@xmath114 number densities @xmath115  . at their present stage of evolution , the clouds have gravitational virial parameters @xmath116 80150 , indicating that they are not bound by their self - gravity ( @xmath117 is the observed cloud velocity dispersion , @xmath118  , and @xmath119 is the cloud mass ) . if we assume that the total mass of the tails was originally in the molecular clouds , we find that the clouds have been reduced from their initial mass by a factor of about 5 : according to the formal definition of @xmath109 above , these clouds would be classified as largely destroyed .",
    "if we set @xmath120 , the cloud destruction time is @xmath121 for shock velocities @xmath122   and an initial density contrast @xmath123 ( with @xmath124 a few parsec and @xmath125 ) , the clouds will survive for times of order a few @xmath126  , long enough for them to become enveloped by the wind .",
    "we conclude that the molecular clouds can survive the passage of the initial shock , after which they are gradually destroyed while mass - loading the surrounding flow .",
    "the mass - loading of flows by embedded clouds has been discussed in a series of papers by dyson and collaborators @xcite . for an initially pressure - confined cloud which becomes immersed in a wind flow ,",
    "the pressure gradients across the cloud surface cause a lateral expansion of the cloud which mixes cloud gas into the wind .",
    "@xcite show that the mass loss rate from the cloud is    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the isothermal sound speed in the cloud , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the wind density and velocity , and @xmath131 is the mach number in the wind . in this expression",
    ", @xmath132 is a constant of order unity for which @xcite provisionally assign a value @xmath133 .",
    "assuming that the wind and cloud parameters ( except @xmath119 ) are roughly constant over the cloud lifetime , the cloud mass loss rate averaged over the entire cloud lifetime is @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the maximum mass loss rate corresponding to the initial mass @xmath136 of the cloud .",
    "therefore , @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number density of the cloud ( we have assumed a mean mass per particle of @xmath139  ) .    for simplicity , we assume that the initial cloud mass ( the current molecular cloud mass plus the mass in the tails ) was contained within a single cloud , thus @xmath140  .",
    "the relative fraction of the initial mass in the tails and the clouds indicates that @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the cloud lifetime predicted by integrating the cloud mass loss rate .",
    "we thus appear to be observing the clouds near the half - way point in time of their destruction process .",
    "the mass loss rate averaged over this time period ( the dynamical timescale @xmath88 ) is @xmath143 , roughly twice @xmath144 . using our value of @xmath136",
    ", we obtain @xmath145 where we have assumed @xmath146 ( i.e. @xmath147 ) .",
    "we have observed a value @xmath1481.3  3.9@xmath149   ( for @xmath150 ) , which implies that we can match the theoretically predicted mass loss rate if @xmath151    in the theory of @xcite , the isothermal sound speed @xmath128 is better identified as the characteristic speed at which the dense cloud can supply mass to the wind - cloud mixing region .",
    "thus , we will assume that the effective value of @xmath128 is @xmath152  .",
    "then , the above condition becomes @xmath153 and has a value of @xmath154 when @xmath155 .",
    "the wind velocity experienced by the dense clouds can not be less than the maximum velocity observed in the tails ( @xmath15640  , depending on @xmath64 ) .",
    "the maximum possible wind speed is however much larger : the winds of massive main sequence stars can have terminal velocities @xmath157   ( cf . table  [ tbl : wr5_hd17603 ] ) . if @xmath158  , the mass - loading model predicts @xmath159 .",
    "such large values of @xmath138 rule out the possibility that the tails are produced in the mass - loading of clouds immersed in a freely - expanding bare stellar wind .",
    "direct momentum - driving of the tails by a wind is also ruled out : the total isotropic linear momentum supplied by the wind of a 4085   star during its main sequence lifetime of a few @xmath160   is approximately @xmath161 ",

    "equating @xmath168 with our observed value of @xmath169  , we see that wind speeds in the mass - loading region greater than @xmath170   ( @xmath171  ) would be sufficient to account for the momentum flux .",

    ". the mixing efficiency may well be smaller @xcite .",
    "lowering the value of the mixing efficiency by a factor of 2 or 3 would increase the required wind speeds in the mass - loading region by a factor of @xmath171 , to @xmath174  . using this higher value ,",
    "the mass - loading theory predicts a wind density in the mass - loading region of @xmath17540  .",
    "we conclude that the mass - loading scenario is workable in the context of the main sequence stellar winds from massive o stars if the fast low - density stellar wind is significantly loaded with mass and greatly slowed before interacting with the dense cloud .",
    "the low inferred wind velocity is consistent with the relative narrowness of the tails as predicted theoretically @xcite and found numerically @xcite for the case of mass loading by a mildly supersonic ( transsonic ) wind .",
    "a related point concerns the apparent complete mixing of mass injected into the wind before encountering the co clouds : in contrast the filaments clearly do not completely mix over a large distance . mixing may be greatly enhanced in a highly inhomogeneous medium having numerous clumps which are close enough togther for wind - driven interactions to occur @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the co clouds associated with the filaments are likely to be the dominant mass concentrations in their vicinity and so are not subject to mixing driven by cloud@xmath14cloud interactions .",
    "our model still requires that the wind transfer very large amounts of kinetic energy to the tails : several times @xmath176  , which is the same order of magnitude as the mechanical luminosity of the main sequence wind of a massive o star .",
    "this is a severe constraint , since in the basic theory of adiabatic stellar wind bubbles , only a tiny fraction , @xmath177 , of the energy is in kinetic form within the bubble , the bulk being in the thermal energy of hot shocked gas and in the kinetic energy of the swept - up shell .",
    "therefore a very small fraction of the energy is available to drive mass - loading of clouds trapped inside .",
    "much higher efficiencies of energy conversion into kinetic form are possible if the stellar wind is itself significantly mass - loaded . @xcite",
    "have shown that mass - loading of an initially highly supersonic wind by mass sources distributed smoothly throughout the region around the star can reduce the mach number of the wind without having the wind going through a global shock near the star .",
    "if the mass loading is sufficiently heavy ( @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the mass loaded into the wind and @xmath180 is the mass of the wind injected by the star ) , a large fraction of the stellar wind energy ( @xmath181 ) will remain in the form of kinetic energy within the wind region @xcite .",
    "therefore , stellar winds which are heavily `` pre - loaded '' with mass may be able to provide the kinetic energy required to drive flows from larger - scale mass concentrations .",
    "it also may potentially explain the low wind velocities and high wind densities that we infer .",
    "in this regard , a scaled - up version of the scenario modelled numerically by @xcite , the mass - loading of the wind from the trapezium cluster by propylds , may be relevant .",
    "@xcite showed that mass - loading could have very significant dynamical effects on the wind , including increased wind density and low mach numbers at large radii .",
    "however , even with a high efficiency of momentum transfer to the filaments , the momentum input of the winds of wr  5 and hd  17603 integrated is too low by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "it would seem then that our scenario requires the wind input from a group of many more o stars in addition to these two .",
    "we have not been able to identify such a grouping of stars . since massive o stars form in ob clusters , short - lived stars such as wr  5 and hd  17603",
    "do not have time to travel far from their birthplaces ( unless they are runaway stars ejected from a binary during the supernova explosion of the other component ) .",
    "although it is not satisfactory to have to posit the existence of an unseen group of ob stars , the apparent close proximity of wr  5 and hd  17603 to each other makes this idea more plausible .",
    "given the effects of visual extinction ( and possible anomalous extinction ) in a direction towards a major spiral arm , and the difficulties of finding , classifying , and obtaining distance estimates , it is perhaps not unlikely that such a grouping of stars could have escaped detection",
    ". given the dynamical timescale of the filaments , it is quite possible that the parent molecular cloud in which the group formed has been largely destroyed by now , and some of its members no longer exist after having gone supernova ( we could speculate that supernova explosions might have contributed to the flow driving ) .",
    "such a remnant grouping of stars might be very difficult to identify .",
    "there are two plausible mechanisms for dissociating the molecular gas which forms the tails : photodissociation and shock dissociation .",
    "stars like wr  5 and hd  17603 produce very large fluxes of ionizing photons ( @xmath182  ) , and thus the ionized skins of the molecular clouds may be observable in .",
    "the brightness can be estimated using , e.g. , equation @xmath183 of @xcite , where we assume a cloud radius 2  , a ratio of ionized skin thickness to cloud radius of @xmath184 , and a source of ionizing photons @xmath185   located @xmath186   from the cloud .",
    "the latter was estimated using equation @xmath187 in @xcite . the resulting surface brightness observed from the earth , assuming no extinction , corresponds to a photon specific flux of @xmath188  .",
    "this is comparable to the surface brightnesses of the fainter photoevaporating cometary knots observed in the helix nebula by @xcite .",
    "if the clouds suffer a similar extinction as wr  5 , the emission will be further attenuated by a factor of @xmath189 .",
    "the large ( @xmath190 ) and patchy visual obscuration may make detection of emission from the clouds difficult ( see discussion in section  [ sec : environ ] ) .",
    "there is no evidence for radio continuum emission from ionized hydrogen from the cgps 1420   continuum data .",
    "any region must thus be of very low radio surface brightness : a 100   path length through a 1   region would produce only a few tenths of a kelvin brightness temperature , which could not easily be distinguished from the general galactic background of several kelvin .",
    "hot massive stars produce photons capable of dissociating molecular hydrogen at rates comparable to the ionizing photon rates @xcite . a rough evaluation of the possibility that the tails are photodissociated can be made by comparing the photodissociating rate into the solid angle of the tails , @xmath191 , to the dissociation rate implied by our observations .",
    "@xmath192   is a typical stellar photodissociating photon rate for a very massive o star , @xmath193 is the probability that an absorption will lead to dissociation @xcite , and @xmath194 is the fractional solid angle subtended by the tails . we find that the two rates are roughly equal at @xmath195 dissociations when integrated over a period of a few @xmath126  .",
    "photodissociation thus appears to be a plausible dissociation mechanism for the tails .",
    "the other possibility is that shocks driven into the molecular clouds by the stellar wind(s ) may be capable of dissociating the h@xmath114 .",
    "j - type shocks , in which the shock velocity @xmath103 is sufficiently high to preclude the existence of a magnetic precursor , are the most effective at dissociating molecular gas . in a strong j - type shock with @xmath196   moving into molecular gas with a pre - shock h@xmath114 number density @xmath197  , about @xmath198 of the h@xmath114 will be dissociated @xcite . for @xmath199 and a wind velocity @xmath130 of the order of a few hundred",
    ", shock velocities will be of the order of @xmath200@xmath201  , which is sufficient to result in very significant dissociation .",
    "the energy required to shock dissociate the molecular gas is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that to accelerate it to the velocity of the tail .",
    "however , shock velocities of this magnitude may reduce the cloud destruction time to values @xmath202  , which is a problem for the scenario we are proposing .",
    "we conclude that photodissociation is the most workable mechanism for dissociating the molecular gas swept into the filaments .",
    "we have discovered an unusual system of `` tails '' comprised of a number of linear or quasi - linear thin filaments which , if projected along their length , appear to have a common origin .",
    "the feature , which we dub hi  g137.7@xmath141.6@xmath1460 , has dimensions of @xmath203   ( length @xmath204 width @xmath204 velocity ) , although its width varies along its length .",
    "located at one end of the filaments is a chain of molecular clouds that lie at a distance of approximately 2  . despite the molecular material being displaced from the atomic by @xmath205  , we propose that the molecular clouds and feature are located at the same distance and are dynamically related .",
    "the lack of a traditional head - tail morphology , and the lack of any evidence of ionization along the leading edge of the molecular clouds , lead us to reject the possibility that this system is simply a cometary cloud ; instead , we propose that the feature is made up of material dissociated from the molecular clouds and entrained in the outflowing wind as a mass - loaded flow .",
    "given the velocity difference between the atomic and molecular material , we estimate the dynamical age of the system to be on the order of a few @xmath126 years . the velocity gradient observed along the feature is , in our model , explained by continuous acceleration of the entrained material by the stellar wind .",
    "a search for driving sources for the filaments identified the wolf - rayet star wr  5 and the of star hd  17603 as candidates .",
    "both these stars are located near the apparent origin of the filaments , are approximately at the same distance as the molecular clouds , and have main sequence lifetimes comparable to the dynamical age of the system .",
    "however , even with the high efficiency of momentum transfer predicted for a heavily mass - loaded wind , wr  5 and hd  17603 are incapable on their own to drive the filaments : we are forced to speculate that other , unidentified stars and/or old supernova explosions must also have been involved .",
    "we can not of course discount the possibility that the positional associations between , co , and stars are simply accidental .",
    "but , assuming that stellar winds ( or explosions ) have shaped the gaseous structures we have observed , we suggest that anisotropic structures similar to hi  g137 should be searched for in the environments around massive stars ( and supernova remnants ) .",
