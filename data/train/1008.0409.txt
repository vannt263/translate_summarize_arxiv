    "how the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars originates is one of the most basic questions that a complete theory of star formation must answer .",
    "it is also one of the most difficult ( see reviews by bonnell et al .",
    "2007 and mckee & ostriker 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "many ideas have been advanced to explain the imf , including zinnecker ( 1982 ) , adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) , elmegreen ( 1997 ) , padoan & nordlund ( 2002 ) , larson ( 2003 ) , shu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , hennebelle & chabrier ( 2008 ) , and kunz & mouschovias ( 2009 ) , among others .",
    "particularly intriguing is the proposal by padoan & nordlund ( 2002 ) that the imf is essentially determined by the supersonic turbulence , which controls the density distribution in the highly inhomogeneous clouds .",
    "they used the jeans criterion to determine analytically the mass distribution of the gravitationally unstable regions , which was taken to represent the stellar imf .",
    "both ingredients of the theory , the turbulent structuring of cloud density and the criterion for gravitational collapse , are strongly affected , however , by a dynamically important magnetic field .",
    "some magnetic effects on the imf , such as the magnetic cushion of turbulent compression ( padoan & nordlund 2002 ) and the additional cloud support by magnetic pressure ( hennebelle & chabrier 2008 ) , can be incorporated into the analytic theory approximately .",
    "other equally , if not more , important magnetic effects are not captured by the theory , and will be the focus of our investigation .",
    "our study will concentrate on the parsec - scale , cluster - forming dense clumps of molecular clouds , where the majority of stars , especially massive stars , are thought to originate ( lada & lada 2003 ) , and where magnetic fields have been observed in some cases . for example , in the nearest region of active massive star formation , omc1 , a well - ordered field is inferred from polarized dust emission ( e.g. , vaillancourt et al .",
    "crutcher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained , from cn zeeman measurements , a line - of - sight field strength @xmath0  @xmath1 g for this region , which corresponds to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio is close to the median value @xmath3 obtained by falgarone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for a sample of dense clumps of massive star formation .",
    "correcting for the projection effects may reduce the ratio by a factor of 2 - 3 ( shu et al .",
    "1999 ) , yielding a median value for the intrinsic mass - to - flux ratio of 2 - 3 .    a magnetic field corresponding to @xmath4a",
    "few would not be strong enough to support the clump against gravitational collapse by itself .",
    "it can , however , change the mass distribution of the stars formed .",
    "this is because individual stars form out of sub - regions of the clump , which are generally more strongly magnetized ( relative to their masses ) than the clump as a whole ( i.e. , with smaller values of @xmath5 , tilley & pudritz 2007 ; dib et al .",
    "2007 ) , because the mass of a region ( which is proportional to volume ) decreases faster with its size than the magnetic flux ( which is proportional to area ) .",
    "in particular , sub - regions smaller than the clump by a factor comparable to @xmath5 are expected to be magnetically subcritical ( with @xmath6 ) in general .",
    "it would be hard to directly compress such regions into collapse by turbulence in the ideal mhd limit ( see , however , nakamura & li 2005 and basu et al .",
    "2009 for studies that include ambipolar diffusion ) .",
    "another effect is that the magnetic forces act on the turbulent flows anisotropically , channeling matter along the field lines into dense , flattened structures that can subsequently fragment thermally .    in this letter , we seek to quantify the above effects using the cluster formation simulations of wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which were carried out with an amr mhd code that includes sink particles and outflow feedback .",
    "we find , in ",
    "[ numerical ] , that the characteristic mass of the imf is lowered by both the magnetic field and outflow feedback .",
    "the lowering of the characteristic stellar mass by magnetic fields is somewhat counter - intuitive .",
    "it is interpreted physically using a so - called `` magnetically critical jeans mass '' ( eq .",
    "[ [ magneticallycriticaljeansmass ] ] ) in   [ discussion ] .",
    "in wang et al . ( 2010 ) , we simulated cluster formation in moderately condensed , isothermal ( @xmath7  k ) , clump of 2  pc in size and @xmath8  m@xmath9 in mass .",
    "we added to the clump , one by one , an initial turbulent velocity field of rms mach number 9 ( model hd ) , an initially uniform magnetic field of @xmath10  @xmath1 g ( corresponding to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of 1.4 for the clump as a whole and a larger value of 3.3 for the central , high - density part ; model mhd ) , and mechanical feedback from collimated outflows driven by accreting stellar objects ( model wind ) . for simulation details",
    "we refer the reader to wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , where we also presented results on the global star formation rate and especially the formation of the most massive object in each simulation . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the distribution of the stellar masses , with an emphasis on low and intermediate mass objects .",
    "figure  1 shows the stellar mass distributions for all three models .",
    "it is a log - linear plot of the number of stars in logarithmic mass bins of @xmath11=0.2 $ ] ( where @xmath12 is the stellar mass in m@xmath9 ) .",
    "the distributions are all evaluated at the time when @xmath13 of the total mass has been converted into stars .",
    "it corresponds to 1.16  myr for model wind ( the last output ) , and 0.576 and 0.723  myr for model hd and mhd , respectively ; for comparison , the free - fall time is @xmath14  myr at the clump center initially and @xmath15  myr in a sphere of 1  pc in radius .    before proceeding to analyze the",
    "numerically obtained mass distributions in fig .  1 , we should caution the reader that the mass of a star can be affected by many factors that are only crudely modeled in the current generation of large - scale cluster formation simulations , including our own .",
    "these include ( 1 ) outflow feedback , which can potentially remove a large fraction , perhaps the majority of the mass of a star - forming core ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ; matzner & mckee 2000 ; myers 2008 ) , ( 2 ) magnetic fields , which affect not only how dense cores form but also how they collapse , and ( 3 ) radiative feedback which , once a protostellar system ( protostar plus disk ) appears , heats up the circumstellar material and suppresses fragmentation close to the central object ( e.g. , krumholz et al .",
    "2007 ; offner et al . 2009 ; price & bate 2009 ; smith et al . 2009 ; urban et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is currently not feasible to treat simultaneously all these factors in detail .",
    "our strategy is to focus on magnetic fields and outflow feedback , which are less well studied , and treat the effects of radiative feedback as simply as possible .",
    "specifically , we crudely capture the suppression of fragmentation near a star due to radiative feedback using a sink - particle merging algorithm , following krumholz et al .",
    "( 2004 , see also discussion in federrath et al .",
    "it eliminates very low mass ( @xmath16  m@xmath9 ) sink particles within a distance @xmath17  au of an existing star ( with mass @xmath18 ) .",
    "experimentation shows that increasing @xmath19 to @xmath20  m@xmath9 does not change the star formation rate or the stellar mass distribution significantly .",
    "the adopted merging distance @xmath21 is comparable to the radius of the so - called `` sphere of thermal influence '' ( where the temperature of the radiatively heated protostellar envelope drops to the ambient value ) of an object of solar mass and luminosity ( see equation  [ 14 ] and figure  2 of adams & shu 1985 ) .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath21 from 1000  au to 2000  au has little effect on the star formation rate and stellar mass distribution .",
    "decreasing it to @xmath22  au ( or three times the size of the finest cell ) does not change the total star formation rate , but can change the number and masses of stars significantly , by up to 50% .",
    "we believe , however , that the smaller merging distance is less realistic , since the gas on the smaller scale is expected to be more strongly heated .",
    "the larger merging distance prevents a collapsing core from breaking up into many small pieces , in agreement with the fact that the best observed cores in nearby star - forming regions typically harbor one , at most a few , stellar systems ( e.g. , mundy et al .",
    "nevertheless , in view of our crude representation of radiative feedback , we elect to focus on the difference between the stellar mass distributions of the three simulations , which use the same sink particle treatment , rather than the distributions themselves .",
    "the magnetic field is solely responsible for the difference between model hd and mhd . from fig .  1 , we see that its main effects are to reduce the number of those intermediate - mass stars with masses around @xmath23  m@xmath9 , and to increase the number of lower mass stars with masses around @xmath24  m@xmath9 .",
    "to be more quantitative , we fit the high mass end of the distribution with a power - law , @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ imf_log ] . in all three cases",
    "the mass distribution deviates sharply from the power - law fit below a characteristic mass , @xmath26 ( sometimes dubbed the `` knee '' of the imf , e.g. , bonnell et al .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and power - law index @xmath27 are listed in table  1 .",
    "note that the characteristic mass of @xmath28 in model hd is not far from the initial jeans mass near the clump center , @xmath29 , consistent with bonnell et al .",
    "the power - indexes are not well determined because of the limited number of stars in the power - law regime . nevertheless , they are all comparable to the salpeter value within uncertainties .",
    "the characteristic masses are , however , significantly different .",
    "in particular , the magnetic field in model mhd has apparently lowered the characteristic mass by a factor of @xmath23 compared to that in model hd .",
    "to help understand why the field hampers the formation of intermediate - mass stars , we show in figure  [ excessstars ] a snapshot of the so - called `` hd excess stars , '' defined somewhat arbitrarily as those stars in hd model in figs .  1 and 2 with masses in the three mass bins between @xmath30 and @xmath31  m@xmath9 .",
    "the majority of these stars are produced at relatively isolated regions , by localized converging flows in the initial turbulence .",
    "such regions are largely absent in the mhd model , where a moderately strong global magnetic field is present .",
    "the reduction in the number of intermediate - mass stars makes the stellar mass distribution significantly narrower in the mhd model than in the hd model ( see table 1 and figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the mhd model interacts strongly with the turbulence .",
    "it changes the `` texture '' of the turbulent clump , by not only resisting the cross - field turbulent compression , but also promoting mass accumulation along the field lines into flattened sheets or filaments .",
    "[ mhd3d ] shows an example of the ( flattened ) filaments resulted from the intrinsically anisotropic magnetic forces .",
    "it is in such magnetically - induced filaments that the majority of the stars in the mhd model form . as we discuss in   [ discussion ] , the high density in the filaments favors the formation of low - mass stars , which are more numerous compared to the non - magnetic hd model .    outflow feedback is responsible for the difference between model wind and mhd . from figs .  1 and 2",
    ", it is clear that the outflows have ( 1 ) shifted the characteristic mass @xmath26 to a lower value , from @xmath32  m@xmath9 to @xmath33  m@xmath9 , and ( 2 ) nearly doubled the number of stars , from 119 to 203 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the lowering of the stellar mass by outflow feedback is perhaps not too surprising , because , individually , the outflow from a given star can remove part of the dense envelope that feeds the growing star ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ; matzner & mckee 2000 ; myers 2008 ) and , collectively , the feedback from all stars can prevent the clump from rapid global collapse ( nakamura & li 2007 ; wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , lowering the total rate of stellar mass accretion .",
    "there is , however , a large spread in both the rate and the duration of the mass accretion in stars of similar masses .",
    "the spread makes it difficult to develop a complete picture of how the outflows lower the characteristic stellar mass precisely .",
    "the number of stars produced per unit time ( i.e. , the stellar production rate ) turns out to be insensitive to the outflow feedback .",
    "it takes longer , however , to convert the same amount of gas into stars in the presence of the feedback , which is the main reason for the larger number of stars in model wind than in model mhd .",
    "we have shown that a magnetic field of strength in the observed range changes the imf significantly , by impeding direct turbulent compression of relatively low density material into relatively massive stars and , more importantly , promoting the formation of dense , flattened structures that subsequently fragment preferentially into low - mass stars .",
    "the basic reason for the magnetic field to impede direct turbulent fragmentation is that a sub - region of the clump that is magnetically subcritical can not be compressed into prompt collapse by turbulence . for a region of size @xmath34 in a clump of average field strength @xmath35 and mass density @xmath36 ,",
    "the characteristic dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio is @xmath37 which indicates that regions smaller than the characteristic size @xmath38 are typically magnetically subcritical ( with @xmath6 ) .",
    "the characteristic size is related to the clump size @xmath39 by @xmath40 ( where `` cp '' stands for `` clump '' ) , since the mass - to - flux ratio of the clump as a whole is @xmath41 according to equation  ( [ locallambda ] ) . in other words , a typical region that is smaller than the clump by a factor of @xmath42",
    "can not be compressed directly into collapse by turbulence .",
    "the corresponding characteristic mass is @xmath43 where we have scaled the clump mass @xmath44 by @xmath45  m@xmath9 , and the clump mass - to - flux ratio by 2.5 , comparable to the ( projection - corrected ) median value inferred from cn zeeman observations ( see discussion in   [ intro ] ) .",
    "the characteristic mass @xmath46 is essentially the magnetic jeans mass at the average clump density ( see equation  [ 41 ] of mckee 1999 , which gives a numerical value three times larger ) .",
    "it is to be compared with the average thermal jeans mass @xmath47 ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "the average magnetic jeans mass @xmath46 is therefore typically larger than the average thermal jeans mass @xmath48 , indicating that the formation of those stars with masses comparable to @xmath48 or smaller by direct turbulent compression can be strongly hindered by the magnetic field .",
    "the most massive stars are expected to be least affected by the magnetic field .",
    "however , their formation may be governed more by the global clump collapse ( retarded by outflow feedback and magnetic fields ) than by direct turbulent compression ( wang et al .",
    "2010 ; see also smith et al .",
    "indeed , massive ( @xmath49 ) stars in model mhd contain more mass than those in model hd , indicating that their formation is not hampered by magnetic fields , unlike intermediate mass stars .",
    "the magnetic field can also promote fragmentation , because of the magnetic forces are intrinsically anisotropic .",
    "it is easier for the turbulent flows to move material along the field lines than across them .",
    "the net result is the formation of flattened , sheet- or filament - like condensations , which are conducive to fragmentation .",
    "larson ( 1985 ) estimated the jeans mass for a self - gravitating sheet ( thermally supported in the vertical direction ) to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath52 the column density . in order to form stars ,",
    "the sheet must first become magnetically supercritical , with a column density greater than the critical value @xmath53 . substituting @xmath54 into equation  ( [ jeanssheet ] )",
    ", we have @xmath55 which is the mass expected for stars formed through thermal fragmentation of magnetically critical filaments . a similar , but somewhat smaller",
    ", characteristic mass @xmath56 was defined in shu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in their study of the collapse of magnetized singular isothermal spheres .",
    "the important conceptual point is that the magnetically critical jeans mass @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) decreases with an increasing magnetic field strength , because a stronger magnetic field can support a higher column density , which in turn leads to a higher volume density ( due to gravitational compression along the field lines ) and thus a lower thermal jeans mass .",
    "it should be relatively insensitive to turbulence , which is expected to be weak at the relevant ( high ) densities . in any case , the magnetically critical jeans mass is typically smaller than the average thermal jeans mass , by a factor @xmath59 which is relatively insensitive to clump parameters .",
    "it is therefore not too surprising that a moderately strong field can lower the characteristic mass of the stars formed in a cluster significantly , as we found numerically .",
    "magnetism is another way of setting a stellar mass scale that is distinct from the one advocated by larson ( 2005 ) , based on detailed thermal physics of molecular cloud material ( e.g. , jappsen et al .",
    "2005 and bonnell et al .",
    "2006 ) . to summarize",
    ", we have demonstrated through both amr mhd simulations (   [ numerical ] ) and analytic considerations ( eqs .",
    "[ [ locallambda]]-[[ratio ] ] ) that moderately strong magnetic fields of the observed strengths ( corresponding to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of a few ) are important in shaping the mass distribution of stars produced in turbulent , cluster - forming , dense clumps .",
    "the basic reason is that the field interacts strongly with the turbulent flows , which affects how the flows create regions unstable to gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "the magnetic field prevents sub - regions of the clump that are magnetically subcritical ( with masses less than the average magnetic jeans mass @xmath46 ) from being compressed directly into collapse by the turbulence .",
    "the magnetic resistance to turbulent compression has apparently reduced the number of intermediate mass stars formed in our simulations .",
    "more importantly , the intrinsically anisotropic magnetic forces channel part of the clump material along the field lines into dense structures , where the high density promotes the formation of low - mass stars with masses comparable to the magnetically critical jeans mass @xmath60 , which lowers the characteristic stellar mass .",
    "the mass is further reduced by outflow feedback , which affects not only the individual stars that drive the outflows , but also the dynamics of the clump as a whole .",
    "we conclude that magnetic fields and outflow feedback are important factors that should be accounted for in a complete theory of the stellar imf .",
