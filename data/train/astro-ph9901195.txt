    "in the past decade , there has been a number of studies on dissipative processes associated with the inflaton decay during its evolution .",
    "these studies have shed light into the possible effects of the dissipative processes .",
    "for instance , it was realized that dissipation effectively slows down the rolling of the inflaton scalar field @xmath3 toward the true vacuum .",
    "these processes are capable of supporting the scenario of inflation @xcite .",
    "recently , inspired by several new developments , the problem of inflation with thermal dissipation has attracted many re - investigations .",
    "the first progress is from the study of the non - equilibrium statistics of quantum fields , which has found that , under certain conditions , it seems to be reasonable to introduce a dissipative term ( such as a friction - like term ) into the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath3 to describe the effect of heat contact between the @xmath3 field and a thermal bath .",
    "these studies shown that the thermal dissipation and fluctuation will most likely appear _ during _ the inflation if the inflaton is coupled to light fields@xcite",
    ". however , to realize sufficient e - folds of inflation with thermal dissipation , this theory needs to introduce tens of thousands of scalar and fermion fields interacting with the inflaton in an _ ad hoc _ manner@xcite .",
    "namely , it is still far from a realistic model .",
    "nevertheless , this study indicates that the condition necessary for the  standard \" reheating evolution  a coupling of inflaton with light fields ",
    "is actually also the condition under which the effects of thermal dissipation during inflation should be considered .    secondly , in the case of a thermal bath with a temperature higher than the hawking temperature , the thermal fluctuations of the scalar field plays an important and even dominant role in producing the primordial perturbations of the universe .",
    "based on these results , the warm inflation scenario has been proposed . in this model , the inflation epoch can smoothly evolve to a radiation - dominated epoch , without the need of a reheating stage@xcite .",
    "dynamical analysis of systems of inflaton with thermal dissipation@xcite gives further support to this model .",
    "it is found that the warm inflation solution is very common .",
    "a rate of dissipation as small as @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the hubble parameter during inflation , can lead to a smooth exit from inflation to radiation .",
    "warm inflation also provides explanation to the super - hubble suppression .",
    "the standard inflationary cosmology , which is characterized by an isentropic de sitter expansion , predicts that the particle horizon should be much larger than the present - day hubble radius @xmath6 .",
    "however , a spectral analysis of the cobe - dmr 4-year sky maps seems to show a lack of power in the spectrum of the primordial density perturbations on scales equal to or larger than the hubble radius @xmath6@xcite . a possible explanation of this super - hubble suppression is given by hybrid models , where the primordial density perturbations are not purely adiabatic , but mixed with an isocurvature component .",
    "the warm inflation is one of the mechanisms which can naturally produce both adiabatic and isocurvature initial perturbations@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the power spectrum of mass density perturbations caused by inflation with thermal dissipation .",
    "one purpose of developing the model of warm inflation is to explain the amplitudes of the initial perturbations .",
    "usually , the amplitude of initial perturbations from quantum fluctuation of the inflaton depends on some unknown parameters of the inflation potential .",
    "however , for the warm inflation model , the amplitude of the initial perturbations is found to be mainly determined by the energy scale of inflation , @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is taken to be about @xmath7 gev , the possible amplitudes of the initial perturbations are found to be in a range consistent with the observations of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "that is , the thermally originated initial perturbations apparently do not directly depend on the details of the inflation potential , but only on some thermodynamical variables , such as the energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "this result is not unexpected , because like many thermodynamical systems , the thermal properties including density fluctuations should be determined by the thermodynamical conditions , regardless of other details .",
    "obviously , it would be interesting to find more ",
    "thermodynamical \" features which contain only observable quantities and thermodynamical parameters , as these predictions would be more useful for confronting models with observations .",
    "guided by these considerations , we will extend the above - mentioned qualitative estimation of the order of the density perturbations to a quantitative calculation of the power spectrum of the density perturbations .",
    "we show that the power spectrum of the warm inflation does not depend on unknown parameters of the inflaton potential and the dissipation , but only on the energy scale @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum is found to be of power law , and the index of the power law can be larger or less than 1 .",
    "more interestingly , we find that for a given @xmath0 , the amplitude and the index of the power law are not independent from each other .",
    "in other words , the amplitude of the power spectrum is completely determined by the power index and the number @xmath0 . comparing this result with the observed temperature fluctuations of the cmb",
    ", we find that both amplitude and index of the power spectrum can be fairly well fitted if @xmath1 gev .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the evolution of the radiation component for inflationary models with dissipation prescribed by a field - dependent friction term .",
    "in particular , we scrutinize the physical conditions on which the thermal fluctuations dominate the primordial density perturbations .",
    "section iii carries out the calculations of the power spectrum of the density perturbations of the warm inflations . and finally , in sec .",
    "iv we give the conclusions and discuss further observational tests .",
    "let us consider a flat universe consisting of a scalar inflaton field @xmath3 and a thermal bath .",

    "statistical mechanics of quantum open systems has shown that the interaction of quantum fields with thermal or quantum bath can be described by a general fluctuation - dissipation relation@xcite .",
    "it is probably reasonable to describe the interaction between the inflaton and the heat bath as a  decay \" of the inflaton @xcite .",
    "these results support the idea of introducing a damping or friction term into the field equation of motion .",

    "the warm inflation scenario is generally defined by a characteristic that the thermal fluctuations of the scalar field dominate over the quantum origin of the initial density perturbations . because the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the scalar field are proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath5 respectively , a necessary condition for warm inflation models is the existence of a radiation component with temperature @xmath27 during the inflationary expansion .",
    "( 2.5 ) is also necessary for maintaining the thermal equilibrium of the radiation component . in general ,",
    "the time scale for the relaxation of a radiation bath is shorter for higher temperature .",

    "it can be seen from figs . 3 , 4 and 5 that for either @xmath213 or @xmath200 , the amplitude @xmath56 is significantly dependent on @xmath0 , but not so sensitive to @xmath21 .",

    "actually , the warm inflation scenario is based on two thermodynamical requirements : ( a ) the existence of a thermalized heat bath during inflation , and ( b ) that the initial fluctuations are given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
