    "gallium selenide ( gase ) belongs to iii - vi layered semiconductor family which is characterized by a strong anisotropy in the chemical bonding .",
    "its crystal @xmath4 consists of plane hexagonal lattices which are associated in pairs and may be stacked in different ways(@xmath5-polytypes)@xcite-@xcite , being the most common one the corresponding to @xmath6-polytype ( @xmath7 space group ) .",
    "the possibility of growing iii - vi semiconductors thin films by van der waals epitaxy@xcite-@xcite opens new opportunities to their potential practical applications , e.g. electronic devices@xcite and solar cells@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the study of the fundamental electrical transport properties is a very important issue . in the case of gase , at ambient pressure , these @xmath8 have been investigated in detail by different authors who have focused their @xmath9 on the role played by impurities such as cd@xcite , cu@xcite , n@xcite , sn@xcite and zn@xcite . in contrast , very little is known about the behaviour of transport properties under pressure ( p ) .",
    "pressure experiments are an efficient tool to study iii - vi semiconductors since they allow the tuning of the degree of anisotropy of these materials .",
    "@xmath10 studies of their optical@xcite-@xcite and lattice dynamical@xcite-@xcite properties under @xmath11 have been subjects of recent interest .",
    "however , systematic research of the electrical transport properties under compression has been only made for @xmath12 selenide ( inse ) , for which , resistivity ( @xmath13 ) and hall effect ( he ) measurements under pressure have been reported very recently@xcite .    in this article , we report a systematic study on transport properties under high pressure , up to 4 gpa at room temperature ( rt ) , of the iii - vi layered p - gase . in section",
    "ii we briefly describe the experimental setup .",
    "the data obtained on he and resistivity measurements are presented in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to the discussion of these results and their implications .",
    "the p - gase single crystals used in this study were grown by the conventional bridgman technique .",
    "doping by tin ( sn ) was performed by adding the pure element so as to get 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.5 at @xmath14 in the stoichiometric melt of gase .",
    "nitrogen ( n ) was introduced as gan compound in a quantity to give a concentration of 0.5 at @xmath14 of n in the melt .",
    "we should point out that these concentrations are different from the effective ones , since during the bridgman growth most of the initial impurity concentration is segregated to the end of the ingot@xcite .",
    "samples with faces perpendicular to the c - axis were prepared from the ingots by cleaving and cutting with a razor blade .",
    "thickness of the slabs was measured by using the interference fringe pattern in the infrared transmission spectrum .",
    "typical sample dimensions were 70 @xmath15 m in thickness and about 4@xmath164 mm@xmath17 in size .",
    "pressure up to 4 gpa was applied to the samples by using the bridgman cell that has been described in reference @xcite . in this case , we have used tungsten carbide anvils , 27 mm in diameter , which were put between the pistons of a 150-ton press .",
    "sodium chloride was the pressure transmitting - medium .",
    "the pyrophillite gaskets were 0.5 mm in thickness , with a hole of 9 mm .",
    "the bridgman gasket assembly and geometry are shown in the inset of figure 1 .",
    "ohmic contacts were made in a van der pauw geometry@xcite by soldering silver wires with high - purity indium in gold contact pads which were previously vacuum evaporated .",
    "he and resistivity measurements were carried out at rt .",
    "direct electric current ranging from 50 @xmath15a to 500 @xmath15a was sent through the samples , and the resulting voltages were measured by a digital voltmeter .",
    "the linearity of the ohmic voltages on the injected current was checked out at different pressures .",
    "a magnetic field of 0.6 tesla was applied parallel to the c - axis .",
    "the magnetic field was generated by means of a copper coil placed around one of the pistons of the press .",
    "figure 1 shows the pressure dependence of resistivity for n - doped and @xmath18 gase samples . the nominal doping concentration ( [ n ] or [ sn ] ) of each measured sample is also given in this figure .",
    "resistivity appears to decrease with pressure in all the samples here studied .",
    "this evolution is more pronounced in the samples doped with n , in which @xmath13 goes down a factor three in the explored range of pressure .",
    "this factor is nearly constant in all the sn - doped samples , in which resistivity decreases with doping , except in the slabs with the highest tin content ( [ sn ] = @xmath19 ) .",
    "the decrease of the resistivity with pressure turns out to be due to the increase of both the hole concentration and mobility , as shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 shows the pressure behaviour of the hole concentration ( @xmath20 ) for different samples as determined through @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the electron charge and @xmath23 is the hall coefficient .",
    "the hall factor has been assumed to be 1@xcite .",
    "it can be seen in figure 2 that @xmath20 non - linearly increases under compression , the relative variation of @xmath20 being higher for samples doped with n. in samples doped with sn , at zero pressure @xmath20 is enlarged with increasing [ sn ] with the exception of the 0.5@xmath14 sn - doped sample in which @xmath20 is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "in addition , in this sample the relative change of @xmath20 is the largest among the sn - doped samples .",
    "as regards the mobility ( @xmath15 ) , figure 3 shows its pressure dependence .",
    "it can be seen there that the mobility also increases with pressure and that its value at ambient pressure is very similar to that obtained in previous works@xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    to understand the pressure dependence of @xmath20 we have considered that n - doped and sn - doped gase at rt are extrinsic as reflected in the temperature dependence of their transport properties@xcite .",
    "moreover , from the temperature behaviour of the hole concentration it was deduced that doping by n introduces only one @xmath24 level with ionization energy of @xmath25 = 210 mev@xcite . in the sn - doped @xmath26 two impurity levels with ionization energies of @xmath25 = 155 and 310 mev",
    "have been observed@xcite .",
    "these levels appear to be connected with the presence of a double acceptor - impurity .",
    "this acceptor has been proposed to be an interstitial sn atom in the octahedral interlayer site associated to a close ga - vacancy , @xmath27 a local configuration similar to that of sn in the layered compound snse@xmath28@xcite . at rt",
    "the first level ( @xmath25 = 155 mev ) is not fully ionized , so that the pressure @xmath29 of @xmath20 is mainly determined by its behaviour under pressure .",
    "however , when @xmath30 the doping of sn to 0.5@xmath14 a decrease of the hole concentration has been observed ( see figure 2 ) indicating that , at very high sn concentration , a donor @xmath31 of sn in gase ( isolated sn interstitial or sn substituting to ga ) becomes dominant and overcompensates the acceptor centers . then , as in the heaviest doped samples the first level ( 155 mev ) is completely compensated , the behaviour of the second level ( 310 mev ) would determine the variation of @xmath20 under @xmath32 @xmath33 we can analyze in both cases the pressure dependence of @xmath20 through a single @xmath34 donor model for partially compensated p - type semiconductors@xcite .",
    "within this model the hole concentration is given by : @xmath35^{1/2}\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the absolute temperature , @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath25 refers to the ionization energy of the acceptor level , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the donor and acceptor impurity concentration , respectively , and @xmath40 is the density of states of the valence band which can be written at rt as a function of the effective mass in the valence band @xmath41 as : @xmath42    where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 stand for the free electron mass , the perpendicular and parallel effective hole masses , respectively . taking @xmath45 = 0.8 @xmath46 and @xmath44 = 0.2 @xmath46 at zero pressure@xcite , we obtain @xmath47 = 0.5 @xmath46 .    in eq.(2 )",
    "one can see that @xmath20 depends on the pressure through @xmath47 , @xmath25 and the term @xmath48 .",
    "following the kane model@xcite , the variation of the effective mass with pressure is considered to be proportional to the change of the direct band - gap @xcite . for the pressure dependence of @xmath38",
    "it can be assumed that it is determined by the volume variation@xcite .",
    "then , taking for @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath25 at ambient pressure the values deduced from the temperature dependence of the hole concentration@xcite , and using eq.(2 ) , we can calculate @xmath25 at each pressure .",
    "the result is shown in figure 4 ( points ) . there",
    "it can be seen that the observed behaviour of @xmath20 would be a consequence of a reduction of the ionization energies under pressure .",
    "for the same pressure variation ( from 0 to 4 gpa ) the ionization energy of the n - related acceptor would decrease by 20 @xmath14 , but that of the sn - related one , only by 6.4 or 8.1 @xmath14 .",
    "the ionization energy of a single hydrogenic impurity level can be evaluated in an anisotropic crystal through the gerlach - pollman model@xcite . by using the @xmath49 masses of gase from references @xcite and the static dielectric constant at ambient conditions from reference @xcite one obtains a value of @xmath25 = 72 mev .",
    "the discrepancy between this value and the experiment can be attributed to the differences between the coulomb potential used in the hydrogenic model and the true impurity potential .",
    "it has been shown that the true impurity potential can be represented by an effective potential which includes a central - cell correction to the coulomb potential model@xcite .",
    "then , to modelize the pressure dependence of @xmath25 we take the impurity potential to be@xcite : @xmath50 f(\\alpha,\\theta)\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the effective rydberg energy , the effective bohr radius and the anisotropy function defined in the gerlach - pollman model , respectively , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the adjustable potential parameters , and @xmath56 is equal to 1(2 ) for the single(double ) ionized acceptor - impurity . at small @xmath57 ,",
    "this potential looks like a sphericall well , with a depth @xmath58 given by : @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the static dielectric constant in the direction @xmath62 and parallel to the c - axis , respectively . at large @xmath57",
    "it behaves like a screened coulomb potential .",
    "the turning point is given approximately by @xmath63    the proposed impurity potential model and the coulomb potential are shown schematically in the inset of figure 4 .",
    "the schrdinger equation of the system is solved by the variational method by using a trial function for the electron ground state ( @xmath64 ) as : @xmath65    the variational calculation in which the total energy is minimized leads to : @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the effective charge@xcite .",
    "then the potential parameter @xmath55 is chosen to fit the ionization energy of the single acceptor level at room pressure .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath55 is shown in table 1 together with @xmath58 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath25 depends on the pressure through @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the first term of eq.(7 ) decreases under pressure due to the reduction of @xmath69 as a consequence of the increase of @xmath61@xcite .",
    "the second term also decreases under pressure , but more slowly because @xmath71 .",
    "the calculated pressure dependence of @xmath25 is shown in figure 4 ( solid lines ) .",
    "it can be seen there that the model fits quite well the experiment .",
    "the shift observed in the second sn - related level may be connected with the fact that in the present model we have neglected the electron - electron interactions and , as a consequence of this , we could be overestimating the value of @xmath25 . to understand why @xmath25 suffers a greater decrease in n - doped samples ,",
    "let us consider the parameters given in table  1 .",
    "it can be seen there that in this case the square well is deeper .",
    "this is just what one may expect because n is much more electronegative than sn .",
    "that is why the central - cell correction is more important in n - doped samples than in @xmath18 samples .",
    "because of this a deeper acceptor level is obtained . in addition , the second term of eq.(7 ) would decrease more rapidly leading to the greater change observed in @xmath25 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    ionized impurity scattering and two - phonon scattering mechanisms must be considered in order to give a quantitative account of the pressure dependence of the hole mobility .",
    "the ionized impurity concentration has been assumed to be that obtained from the temperature dependence of the hole concentration@xcite .",
    "the phonons involved are the 138 @xmath72 @xmath73 homopolar optical mode and the 153.2 @xmath72 @xmath74 lo polar optical mode@xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the frhlich constant@xcite ( @xmath75 ) and the hole - homopolar phonon coupling constant@xcite ( @xmath76 ) were calculated from data found in the literature@xcite . as the hole scattering rate for lo phonons",
    "is obtained through an integration over all the possible directions of the phonon momentum , @xmath75 was calculated through@xcite : @xmath77    we have obtained for both coupling constants a decreasing behaviour under @xmath11 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath76 is basically a result of the increase of the homopolar phonon frequency under pressure@xcite . for @xmath75 , in spite of the increase of @xmath78 , due to the great increase of @xmath61 under compression@xcite , the overall change is negative because of the decrease of @xmath79 , which is more than four times higher than @xmath78    by means of an iterative method@xcite we have calculated the pressure @xmath29 of @xmath15 .",
    "the ionized impurity scattering has been included through the @xmath80 relaxation time@xcite , in which the ionized impurity concentrations has been assumed to be that used to calculate @xmath25 a a function of pressure .",
    "the results obtained for the samples doped with [ sn ] = 0.05 @xmath14 and 0.1 @xmath14 and with [ n ] = @xmath81 which are plotted in solid lines in figure 3 , agree quite well with the measurements .",
    "the isolated contribution of each scattering mechanism is also represented in figure 3 . the @xmath82 phonon scattering ( curve 1 ) and the lo polar phonon scattering ( curve 2 ) are the dominant mechanisms over the whole pressure range , but the ionized impurity scattering mechanism ( curve 3 ) must be taken into account to @xmath83 quantitatively the absolute value of @xmath15 .",
    "the saturation of the increase of @xmath15 above 2.5 gpa is due to the saturation of the decrease of @xmath75 as a consequence of the compensation between the lo polar phonon frequency and @xmath61 increases . in @xmath84 , the increase of the concentration of ionized impurities , determined by the increase of @xmath20 and the contraction of the volume under compression , leads to a reduction of the impurity - limited mobility , which also collaborates to the saturation of @xmath15 .    finally , we want to point out that for samples doped with [ sn ] = 0.2 @xmath14 and @xmath19 the value of the zero pressure mobility can not be reproduced with the present model .",
    "samples from the 0.2 @xmath14 ingot exhibit a phonon - controlled @xmath85 in a larger temperature range than those from ingots with lower tin @xmath86 we think that this can be related to the fact that a large proportion of complex impurity @xmath87 are present in these samples , resulting in a @xmath88 of the @xmath89 of single ionized impurities@xcite .",
    "these complex centers appear to have a lower @xmath90 cross section than ionized impurities , producing that @xmath90 by phonons is the dominant scattering mechanism in spite of the heavy doping @xmath89 of the 0.2@xmath14 sn - doped sample .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of those centers and its influence on the hole mobility is not known and can hardly be included in our model . in samples from the 0.5 @xmath14 sn - doped ingot the @xmath91 is very high and impurity scattering is dominant even at room @xmath92 reducing the mobility to the low value observed ( @xmath15 = 9.5 cm@xmath17/vs ) , but this value and its temperature dependence could not be accounted for through any known scattering mechanism .",
    "transport measurements have been carried out under pressure in n - doped and sn - doped gase up to 4 gpa . within the framework of a single acceptor - single donor model ,",
    "the observed increase of @xmath20 under compression has been interpreted to be due to the reduction of @xmath25 with pressure .",
    "modeling the impurity potential we have obtained an expression for @xmath25 .",
    "this allows us to relate the decrease under pressure of @xmath25 to the increase of @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , we have also discussed the different behaviour under pressure of the ionization energies of the acceptor levels connected to sn and n as doping impurities in gase .",
    "the higher reduction of @xmath25 observed in n - doped samples has been explained by means of the deeper @xmath94 correction obtained in this case .",
