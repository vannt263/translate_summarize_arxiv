    "this article will describe a set of physical assumptions which are sufficient for a semiclassical gravitational theory to obey the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics @xcite . from these physical assumptions , a proof of the gsl",
    "will be given for rapidly evolving matter fields and arbitrary horizon slices .",
    "this shows that the gsl holds in differential form , i.e. the entropy is increasing at each spacetime point on the horizon .",
    "as far as i am aware , this is the first time such a general proof of the gsl has been given .    the gsl appears to hold on any causal horizon , i.e. the boundary of the past of any future infinite worldline @xcite .",
    "causal horizons include black hole event horizons , as well as rindler and de sitter horizons . the gsl states that on any horizon , the total entropy of fields outside the horizon , plus the total entropy of the horizon itself , must increase as time passes .",
    "this total increasing quantity is known as the generalized entropy .",
    "more precisely , for any complete spatial slice @xmath0 intersecting the horizon @xmath1 , the generalized entropy of @xmath0 is given by @xmath2 in general relativity , the horizon entropy is proportional to the area is a c - number , for consistency it is necessary to interpret @xmath3 as a c - number as well . in this article , this will be done by taking the semclassical approximation , in which the area @xmath4 is a classical quantity , sourced by the expectation value of a quantum operator . however , this semiclassical approximation can only be an approximation to the true quantum gravity theory , in which the area @xmath4 becomes an operator . in ref .",
    "@xcite i argued that one should then interpret @xmath4 as being the expectation value of the quantum area operator . ] ) : @xmath5 the second term is the von neumann entropy of the matter fields restricted to the region outside of the horizon : @xmath6 however , this outside entropy term has an ultraviolet divergence at the horizon due to the entanglement entropy of fields at very short distances .",
    "so to define the generalized entropy , some kind of renormalization scheme must be employed to subtract off these divergences ( cf . section [ ren ] ) .",
    "historically , the laws of thermodynamics for matter have provided substantial clues about the microscopic statistical mechanics of atomic systems .",
    "it seems probable that the gsl will provide similar insight into the statistical mechanics of spacetime itself @xcite .",
    "because quantum gravity is currently outside of our experimental range of detection , any help which can be obtained from the gsl would be very useful .",
    "the gsl is especially evocative because of how surprising it is : it essentially says that an apparently open system ( the exterior of the horizon ) behaves in roughly the way that we would expect a closed thermodynamic system to behave .",
    "there are several different claims that in order for the gsl to be true , certain restrictions must hold even semiclassically on e.g. bounds on the entropy and/or number of particle species proposed by bekenstein @xcite , bousso @xcite , or dvali @xcite , bounds on the fine structure constant @xcite , the unbrokenness of the lorentz group @xcite , and/or energy conditions @xcite .",
    "if true , these claims hint at important restrictions on any good theory of quantum gravity .",
    "( however , in my opinion , only the last two of these claims have been clearly established . )",
    "one way to test these proposed requirements is by proving the gsl , and thus seeing explicitly what assumptions are necessary .",
    "once we know what key assumptions are necessary for the gsl to hold semiclassically , we will be in a better position to guess background - free constructions of quantum gravity based on thermodynamic principles .",
    "until recently , there were satisfactory proofs of the semiclassical gsl only in the ` quasi - steady ' case in which the fields falling into the black hole are slowly changing with time @xcite .",
    "one such quasi - steady argument was the illuminating but incomplete proof by sorkin @xcite ( reviewed in ref .",
    "sorkin considered the case of a physical process @xmath7 ( which may involve information loss ) , with the property that a thermal state @xmath8 evolves to itself under the process : @xmath9 he then invoked a theorem saying that whenever this happens , the free energy of any other state @xmath10 can not increase under the same time evolution : @xmath11 the free energy can then be related to the generalized entropy using the `` first law '' of horizon thermodynamics @xmath12 ( which applies only to slowly changing horizons ) .",
    "unfortunately , the proof founders when applied to black holes @xcite , since the state outside the black hole could only be shown to be thermal outside of the bifurcation surface , while a nontrivial application of the gsl requires time evolution from one slice of the horizon to another slice .",
    "furthermore the hartle - hawking thermal state exists only for nonrotating black holes , so there are even worse problems in applying the proof to kerr black holes .    my previous proof in ref .",
    "@xcite side - stepped these problems for the special case of ( perturbed ) rindler wedges evolving to other rindler wedges . in this case it was possible to show that the gsl holds semiclassically even for rapid changes to the horizon , at every instant of time , using a reasonable assumption about the renormalization properties of @xmath13 .",
    "however , this proof was limited to rindler horizons sliced by flat planes ; it was unable to reach de sitter space , black holes , or even arbitrary slices of rindler horizons .",
    "the basic problem is that the proof requires not only a boost symmetry of each wedge ( in order to show that the state restricted to the wedge is thermal ) , it also needs a null translation symmetry ( so that there will be multiple thermal wedges ) . but this is more symmetry than is possessed by most spacetimes with stationary horizons .    in this article",
    "i will generalize the proof to ( semiclassical perturbations of ) arbitrary slices @xmath0 of the future horizon @xmath1 .",
    "the new ingredient is the technique of restricting the quantum fields to a null hypersurface .",
    "in particular ( at least for free fields ) there is an infinite dimensional symmetry group due to the freedom to reparameterize each horizon generator separately @xcite",
    ". this symmetry will play an important role in the proof of the gsl in section [ proofon ] .",
    "restriction to a null surface is helpful for solving a variety of quantum field theory problems , e.g. deep inelastic scattering in qcd , because of the insight it gives into the quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "the technique was used by sewell to derive the hawking effect in a very illuminating way @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also been used as a simple way to characterize quantum fields on schwarzschild past horizons @xcite and future horizons @xcite , certain past cosmological horizons @xcite , 1 + 1 rindler horizons @xcite , de sitter horizons @xcite and the conformal boundary of asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the algebra of observables @xmath14 on the horizon plays an important role in the proof : it is required to exist and satisfy four axioms described in section [ sym ] . in the case of free fields and 1 + 1 conformal field theories",
    ", it will be shown that there exists a horizon algebra satisfying these axioms .    in the case of general interacting quantum field theories ,",
    "the restriction of the fields to a null hypersurface is a more delicate matter .",
    "nevertheless , there are reasons to believe that interacting field theories also satisfy the axioms . at least at the level of formal perturbation theory",
    ", the horizon algebra is completely unaffected by the addition of certain kinds of interactions , including both nonderivative couplings , and nonabelian yang - mills interactions .",
    "however , renormalization effects can lead to the introduction of additional higher derivative couplings , as well as infinite field strength renormalization . because of these issues , it is not completely clear whether general interacting field theories have a null hypersurface formulation . some arguments for and against will be given in section [ nonpert ] .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : section [ arg ] will outline the physical assumptions used to prove the gsl , and show why the gsl follows from them .",
    "section [ scalar ] will describe in detail the null hypersurface formulation for a free scalar field .",
    "section [ spin ] will generalize these results to free spinors , photons , and gravitons .",
    "section [ int ] will discuss what happens when interactions are included .",
    "conventions : the metric signature will be plus for space and minus for time . on the horizon",
    ", @xmath15 is a system of @xmath16 transverse coordinates which is constant on each horizon generator , @xmath17 is an affine parameter on each horizon generator , and @xmath18 points along each horizon generator and satisfies @xmath19 . when moving off the horizon",
    ", @xmath20 will be a null coordinate such that the horizon is located at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 will be a null coordinate which satisfies @xmath23 on the horizon , such that the metric on the horizon is @xmath24    to reduce clutter , i will use the notation @xmath25 .",
    "in order to prove the gsl , i need to make three basic physical assumptions :    1 .   * semiclassical einstein gravity . * the proof will apply to the semiclassical regime ( section [ sreg ] ) , in which all physical effects can be controlled by an expansion in @xmath26 , where @xmath17 is the characteristic de broglie wavelength of the matter fields .",
    "this expansion is valid when @xmath27 . by holding @xmath17 and @xmath28 fixed , one can regard this as an expansion in @xmath29 .",
    "the leading order physics is given by quantum field theory on a fixed classical spacetime .",
    "however , at higher orders in @xmath29 there are perturbations to the spacetime metric due to gravitational back - reaction .",
    "+ these perturbations affect the horizon area @xmath4 at @xmath30 , and therefore affect @xmath3 at @xmath31 . at this order ,",
    "the gravitational backreaction will be treated as a c - number , and will be calculated using the semiclassical einstein equation @xmath32 .",
    "it will also be assumed that the matter is minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "the existence of a null hyperspace formalism . * ignoring the backreaction , matter is described by a quantum field theory on the background spacetime .",
    "the interesting case is when the horizon is stationary ( for example , a killing horizon plus nonstationary matter far from the horizon ) ; otherwise the gsl reduces to the classical area law ( cf .",
    "section [ sreg ] ) . in this case , the qft which describes matter must have a null hypersurface formulation , i.e. there must be a nontrivial algebra of operators @xmath14 corresponding to fields restricted to the horizon itself .",
    "+ this algebra must satisfy four axioms ( section [ sym ] ) : _ determinism _ means that all information outside of the horizon can be predicted from the horizon algebra @xmath14 together with the algebra @xmath33 at future null infinity .",
    "_ ultralocality _ means that the fields on different horizon generators are independent , so that the algebra @xmath14 tensor - factorizes for spatially - disjoint open subsets in the transverse @xmath15-directions .- point functions of the fields vanish at spacelike separations .",
    "this property may be surprising at first to those familiar with canonical quantization of fields on spacelike surfaces .",
    "however , for free fields on a null surface it obtains because there are no derivatives in the formulae for the null stress - energy @xmath34 or the commutators of fields . ]",
    "( because the fields are distributions it is still necessary to smear them in the transverse directions to obtain well - defined operators . )",
    "_ local lorentz symmetry",
    "_ means that the degrees of freedom on each horizon generator are symmetric under translations and boosts .",
    "and _ stability _ is the requirement that the fields on each horizon generator have positive energy with respect to the null translation symmetry .",
    "( these four axioms will be explicitly shown for free qft s in section [ scalar]-[spin ] . )",
    "+ in the case of a free field @xmath35 , this algebra can contain operators that depend on the pullback of @xmath35 to the horizon @xmath36 , but not on e.g. the derivative moving away from the horizon @xmath37 . for this definition ,",
    "all four axioms will be shown to hold for fields with various spins ( sections [ scalar]-[spin ] ) .",
    "but in the case of interacting fields , it is not clear which operator(s ) should be regarded as the fundamental field . in this case",
    "it will simply be taken as an assumption that there exists some algebra @xmath14 satisfying these properties .",
    "some tentative arguments for and against this assumption will be discussed in section [ int ] .",
    "3 .   * a renormalization scheme for the generalized entropy . * because the entanglement entropy outside of the horizon diverges , any proof that generalized entropy increases must be formal unless this divergence is regulated and renormalized . rather than specify a particular renormalization scheme ,",
    "i will simply describe what properties the scheme must have ( section [ ren ] ) .",
    "the proof of the gsl depends on proving that the free boost energy @xmath38 can not increase as time passes .",
    "formally , this quantity can be divided into two parts : the boost energy @xmath39 and the entropy @xmath40 . although @xmath38 can be rigorously defined and is finite , both @xmath39 and @xmath40 suffer divergences which must be renormalized .",
    "it is necessary to assume that , when @xmath39 is written in terms of the renormalized stress - energy tensor , and @xmath40 is written in terms of the renormalized entropy , the expected relationship between these three quantities continues to hold .",
    "since this property can be rigorously shown for infinite lattice spin systems @xcite , it is reasonable to believe that it also holds for quantum field theories .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", the consequences of these three assumptions will be described in more detail .",
    "one of these consequences is that the horizon is thermal with respect to dilations about any slice [ thermal ] .",
    "this  together with an information theory result known as the `` monotonicity of the relative entropy '' ( section [ relative])implies the gsl ( sections [ proofon]-[outside ] ) .      in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", we add certain quantum fields @xmath35 to the classical spacetime , and use their expected stress - energy @xmath41 as a source for an order @xmath29 perturbation to the metric . in the semiclassical limit one takes @xmath29 to be small , so that the perturbation to the metric is small compared to the classical metric .",
    "regime invoked here should be distinguished from the large @xmath42 semiclassical regime in which one has a large number of particle species and takes @xmath43 while holding @xmath44 fixed . in that kind of semiclassical regime",
    "the quantum corrections to the metric can be of the same order as the classical metric , so that it is not possible to regard it as a small perturbation .",
    "proving the gsl in the large @xmath42 regime will be left for another day . ]",
    "the perturbed metric can be expanded in @xmath29 as : @xmath45 the zeroth order term is the classical background metric , the half order term is due to quantized graviton fluctuations , and the first order term is due to the gravitational field of matter or gravitons . since the gsl is an inequality , in the limit of @xmath43 , the truth or falsity of the gsl",
    "is determined solely based on the highest order in @xmath29 contribution to the time derivative of the generalized entropy .",
    "the back - reaction of the quantized fields is the @xmath30 part of the metric , and will be calculated using the semiclassical einstein equation : @xmath46 in which the einstein tensor @xmath47 is regarded as a c - number , while the stress - energy tensor @xmath48 is a quantum operator .",
    "a few words are in order about the justification of eq .",
    "( [ semi ] ) . in reality , the metric tensor ought to be quantized just as the matter fields are .",
    "when this is done , one should use not the semiclassical einstein equation , but the full einstein equation , interpreted as an operator equation .",
    "however , in the linearized weak - field approximation limit , the semiclassical einstein equation should be recoverable from the operator einstein equation by taking expectation values of the @xmath30 part of the metric @xcite .",
    "in addition , there should be higher order in @xmath29 corrections to the einstein equation , coming from renormalization theory .",
    "however , because this article only treats back - reaction at leading order in @xmath29 , effects which are higher order in @xmath29 may be neglected .",
    "hence , because this article uses the semiclassical expansion only when controlled by an @xmath29 expansion , the results are presumably in correspondence with the full quantum theory .",
    "this regime is much more circumscribed than the `` self - consistent '' semiclassical solutions of e.g. flanagan and wald @xcite . in particular ,",
    "pathological features such as run - away solutions are outside of the scope of this regime , since they show up only when all orders in @xmath29 become important .",
    "[ [ semiclassical - expansion - of - the - raychaudhuri - equation . ] ] semiclassical expansion of the raychaudhuri equation .",

    "let @xmath51 be the expansion of the horizon , and @xmath52 the shear .",
    "then it follows from the convergence property of the raychaudhuri equation : @xmath53 together with the null - null component of the einstein equation @xmath54 and the absence of any singularities on the horizon itself , that @xmath55 furthermore , if any generator of the horizon has nonvanishing null energy or shear anywhere , the entropy is strictly increasing along that horizon generator prior to that time .",
    "this is the classical area increase theorem .",
    "this classical result can be used to divide the semiclassical gsl into three cases based on the classical @xmath31 part of the metric . either :",
    "1 ) the horizon is classically growing , 2 ) it is classically stationary , or 3 ) it is classically growing up to a certain time @xmath56 , after which it becomes stationary . in case",
    "( 1 ) , the zeroth order area increase corresponds to an @xmath57 increase in the generalized entropy , which dominates over all other effects .",
    "therefore the gsl holds . in case",
    "( 2 ) quantum effects can cause the area to decrease , and therefore it is an interesting question whether the gsl holds or not . in case",
    "( 3 ) , the gsl must be true before time @xmath56 , so the only question is whether it holds after @xmath56 .",
    "but the gsl after @xmath56 makes no reference to anything that occurred before @xmath56 . consequently without loss of generality",
    "we need consider only case ( 2 ) , in which the horizon is always classically stationary .",
    "any violation of the gsl must come from quantum effects , corresponding to order @xmath58 contributions to the generalized entropy .. in the semiclassical limit , the only way these higher order corrections could violate the gsl is if the gsl is saturated at order @xmath59 .",
    "this would require the fields on the horizon to be in a special state for which the time derivative of the generalized entropy is exactly _ zero _ at order @xmath59 .",
    "probably the only such equilibrium state is the hartle - hawking state .",
    "but in this state , the gsl holds to all orders in @xmath29 , by virtue of time translation symmetry .",
    "thus , the gsl can be expected to hold to all orders in @xmath29 , in the semiclassical regime .",
    "a more interesting question is what happens outside the semiclassical regime , when all orders in @xmath29 can become equally important . ]",
    "since there is no half - order contribution to @xmath48 or @xmath60 , the half order raychaudhuri equation says @xmath61 we can now write the first order part of the raychaudhuri equation as @xmath62 the @xmath63 term is of order @xmath64 and is therefore negligible .",
    "if one ignores gravitons , then the shear term @xmath65 can be neglected . on the other hand , in processes involving gravitons , the shear term must be included ( cf .",
    "section [ grav ] ) .",
    "the easiest way to handle gravitons is to lump the shear squared term in with @xmath34 as a gravitational analogue of the null energy flux .",
    "below , the stress - energy tensor should be read as including the shear - squared term , thus : @xmath66",
    "so when energy falls across the classically stationary horizon , it makes it no longer stationary at order @xmath67 .",
    "let us now calculate the area @xmath4 of a slice @xmath0 cutting the horizon .",
    "a specific slice @xmath0 may be defined by specifying the affine parameter @xmath68 as a function of the horizon generator . in order to calculate the effects of @xmath34 on the area @xmath69 of the slice , we use the relation between the expansion and the area : @xmath70 where @xmath4 is the area of an infinitesimal cross section of the horizon .",
    "this allows the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ linray ] ) to be rewritten as : @xmath71 where the second term can be dropped in the semiclassical approximation because it is nonlinear in @xmath72 .",
    "thus the linearized raychaudhuri eq .",
    "( [ linray ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath73 after integrating this twice in the @xmath17 direction , one obtains for the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lin2 ] ) @xmath74 by using the fundamental theorem of calculus twice , as well as applying the `` teleological '' boundary condition suitable for a future event horizon : @xmath75 meanwhile , the identical transformation of eq .",
    "( [ lin2 ] ) s right - hand side is @xmath76 the final step is to integrate the infinitesimal areas a in the @xmath77 transverse @xmath15-directions .",
    "one obtains the key relationship @xmath78 where the area element has been absorbed into the definition of the transverse integration measure @xmath79 .    in the next section",
    "it will be seen that @xmath80 is the generator of a `` boost '' transformation on the horizon about the slice @xmath81 .",
    "thus the physical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ tint ] ) is that , up to an additive constant , the boost energy @xmath39 is proportional to the area : @xmath82 the constant @xmath83 can be dropped for purposes of the gsl , which is only concerned with area differences .    in the special case where @xmath0 is the bifurcation surface of the unperturbed horizon , eq .",
    "( [ tint ] ) is the ` physical processes ' version of the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite , while eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) indicates that the horizon area is canonically conjugate to the killing time @xcite . but to show the gsl , it is important that these formulae hold even when @xmath0 is not the bifurcation surface .",
    "as stated above , we are assuming that our matter quantum field theory has a valid null - hypersurface initial- value formalism .",
    "that means that there must be a field algebra @xmath14 which can be defined on any stationary horizon @xmath1 without making reference to anything outside of @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , all properties of the algebra must be defined using no more than :    1 .",
    "some set of quantum operators defined as a local net of algebras over @xmath1 ( e.g. based on local quantum fields which make sense as operator - valued distributions @xmath84 on @xmath1 ; this will done for free fields in sections [ scalar]-[spin ] ) , 2 .   the transverse components of the metric @xmath85 on @xmath1 , and 3 .",
    "an affine parameter @xmath17 on each horizon generator ( which actually depends on a christoffel symbol @xmath86 in null coordinates ) .    assuming that an algebra can be so defined",
    ", one expects it to obey the four axioms : determinism , ultralocality , local lorentz symmetry , and stability .",
    "these axioms will be shown in sections [ scalar]-[spin ] for free fields , but plausibly hold even for interacting fields , assuming that a null hypersurface restriction makes sense at all for such fields ( cf .",
    "section [ int ] ) .",
    "the axiom of determinism says that @xmath14 gives a complete specification of all information falling across the horizon , so that together with the information in @xmath33 at null infinity , one can determine all the information outside the event horizon ( fig .",
    "consequently , any symmetries of the horizon @xmath1 will correspond to hidden symmetries of the theory on the bulk .",
    "thus by working out the symmetry group of @xmath14 , hidden properties of the bulk dynamics will become manifest .     to time slice @xmath87 .",
    "however , all information outside of the horizon must either fall across the horizon @xmath1 or else reach future null infinity @xmath88 ( determinism ) .",
    "hence one can `` push forward '' each of the two time slices to part of @xmath1 and all of @xmath88 without losing any information .",
    "in addition to the killing symmetry which acts on the horizon as a dilation , there is a translation symmetry of @xmath1 ( shown as an arrow ) which is not a symmetry of the whole spacetime .",
    "b ) a transverse view of @xmath1 in the same spacetime .",
    "vertical lines represent horizon generators .",
    "each horizon generator can be independently translated and dilated ( local lorentz symmetry ) ; this permits any two slices on @xmath1 to be translated into each other , and ensures that region above each slice on @xmath1 is thermal with respect to dilations about that slice . in order to prove the gsl this thermal property",
    "is needed for both slice @xmath89 and slice @xmath87 . ]",
    "the axiom of ultralocality says that the degrees of freedom on different horizon generators are independent systems .",
    "so if the set of horizon generators is written as a disjoint union @xmath90 of open regions in the transverse @xmath15-space , then the algebra can be written as a tensor product @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the algebra of fields restricted to @xmath93 .",
    "ultralocality is stronger than microcausality , which merely asserts that the commutators of fields vanish at spacelike separation . in particular , in the vacuum state ( whose existence is guaranteed by the other axioms of local lorentz invariance and stability ) , ultralocality implies that all @xmath94-point functions of field operators in @xmath14 vanish when evaluated on @xmath94 distinct horizon generators .",
    "this property may be shocking to those who are used to canonical quantization on a spacelike initial data surface , because on a spacelike surface it is impossible for any hadamard state to have vanishing entanglement across short spatial distances .",
    "by contrast , on a stationary null surface the vacuum entanglement is arranged solely along each horizon generator and not between different horizon generators @xcite . in the case of a free bosonic field",
    "@xmath35 , this vanishing of @xmath94-point functions is possible because 1 ) the null stress - energy @xmath34 does not depend on transverse @xmath15-derivatives of the field , but only the null derivative @xmath95 , and 2 ) the horizon algebra @xmath14 does not include the field @xmath35 itself ( which has nonvanishing @xmath94-point functions at spacelike separation on the null surface ) , but only @xmath95 ( which does not ) . in minkowski space , in a null coordinate system",
    "@xmath96 that the @xmath94-point functions of @xmath97 vanish when evaluated on the null surface @xmath21 for distinct values of @xmath15 . ]",
    "because ultralocality requires that the different horizon generators can be treated as independent systems ( although the field operators still need to be integrated in the transverse @xmath15-directions to give well - defined operators ) , the remaining two axioms , lorentz symmetry and stability , can without loss of generality be applied to each horizon generator separately .",
    "local lorentz symmetry means that the algebra @xmath14 has an infinite dimensional group @xmath28 of symmetries ( i.e. automorphisms ) corresponding to affine transformations of each horizon generator : @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 being functions of @xmath15 .",
    "each horizon field @xmath84 must transform in some representation of this group ( just as fields in flat spacetime transform in some representation of the poincar group ) .",
    "thus , each element @xmath101 has both a geometrical interpretation ( acting on horizon points ) and an operator interpetation ( acting on fields ) .",
    "compatibility of these two interpretations requires that if an operator @xmath102 is localized in a region @xmath103 , then @xmath104 is localized in @xmath105 .",
    "this is quite a bit more symmetry than can be possessed by the spacetime in which @xmath1 is embedded ( fig 1b ) .",
    "these secret symmetries of @xmath1 , together with the other assumptions , will turn out to imply the gsl .",

    "this component of the stress - energy tensor represents the flux of null energy across the horizon . since the null energy is the generator of null diffeomorphisms , @xmath34 can be integrated to obtain the generator of affine reparameterizations .",
    "the generator of a null translation @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 ( here and below , the area element of the horizon will be considered to be implicit in the integration measure @xmath79 . )",
    "stability says that so long as @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "in other words , the generator of null translations must be nonnegative . by taking the limit",
    "in which the amount of translation is a delta function ( @xmath111 ) , one finds that stability is equivalent to the average null energy condition ( anec ) @xcite , as evaluated on horizon generators ; @xmath112 the anec is a manifestation of the positivity of energies in a quantum field theory .",
    "can be embedded in a spacetime @xmath113 , where the first factor is 1 + 1 dimensional minkowski space , and the second is some @xmath16 dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "now suppose that the quantum fields have their energy bounded below , relative to time translation on @xmath114 .",
    "by lorentz symmetry and continuity , the null energy on @xmath114 must also be bounded below .",
    "all null energy must eventually cross the horizon @xmath1 , hence the null energy on @xmath1 is bounded below .",
    "but by ultralocality this is only possible if each horizon generator is separately stable . ]",

    "all known scale invariant qft s are also conformally invariant , so let us ask whether cft s have a null surface formalism . since the near - horizon limit is a type of ultraviolet limit , it seems probable that a qft has a null surface formulation if and only if the scaling limit cft does .        in the case of 1 + 1",
    "cft s , there always exists a nontrivial algebra of observables @xmath14 on the horizon ( i.e. on a lightray ) , which is simply the algebra of the left - moving chiral fields . to see this , we remind the reader of some facts about 1 + 1 cft s ( from e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the operators of a cft fall into infinite dimensional representations of the conformal algebra associated with the theory s central charges @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "these representations are classified by the weight spectrum of primary operators @xmath409 , which specify the weight of the primary operator in the representation with respect to left and right dilations .",
    "descendants of these operators have weights given by the primary operators plus integers .    the algebra of operators which are well - defined on the horizon is simply the algebra of left - moving chiral operators ( i.e. the algebra generated by quasi - primary operators weight @xmath410 ) . such fields do not depend on the @xmath20 coordinate and therefore must be localizable to the horizon .",
    "( on the other hand , the two two - point function of a non - chiral operator diverges when the two points are null separated on the horizon , so such operators can not be smeared in one null direction alone . )",
    "since the identity operator has weight @xmath411 , there is always an infinite sequence of such operators , including the null stress - energy @xmath34 of weight @xmath412 .",
    "thus there is always an infinite nontrivial horizon algebra @xmath14 , which includes the generators of the conformal group itself .",
    "we now examine whether this horizon algebra obeys the necessary axioms described in section [ sym ] for the proof of the gsl .",
    "ultralocality is trivial in 1 + 1 dimensions , since there is only one horizon generator .",
    "lorentz symmetry and stability hold by virtue of the normal qft axioms .",
    "is equally applicable to 2d dilaton gravity , in which the dilaton plays the role of the `` area '' . ]",
    "the only tricky point is determinism , which requires the exterior of the horizon to be determined by @xmath14 and @xmath33 . in the case of a chiral cft which breaks into independent left - moving and right - moving sectors",
    ", determinism is obvious . in the case of a non - chiral theory ,",
    "the only new issue is that there may be superselection constraints relating the left - moving and right - moving fields .",
    "for example , in the theory of a free fermion , it is possible to introduce a `` twist operator '' with weight @xmath413 , but one can not view this operator as a product of two operators with weight @xmath414 and @xmath415 without destroying modular invariance @xcite .",
    "thus there might be nontrivial constraints relating @xmath14 with @xmath33 .",
    "however , a non - chiral cft can be extended into a chiral cft simply by ignoring these superselection constraints and making the left - moving and right - moving sectors independent .",
    "this can ruin modular invariance , but modular invariance was not needed for the proof of the gsl . by the operator - state correspondence , it will also increase the number of states of the theory , but it does not affect the vacuum state @xmath155 , and one can simply choose the state @xmath10 to satisfy the constraints of the non - chiral cft .      in higher dimensional interacting cft s , a local field",
    "will no longer obey the free wave equation .",
    "this means that it must have a nonzero anomalous dimension @xmath416 .",
    "for example , a primary scalar field in @xmath243 dimensions will have a dimension @xmath417 , with @xmath418 due to the unitarity bound .",
    "such fields do not form operators when smeared on the horizon alone .",
    "this can be seen from evaluating the square of the smeared field using the spectral decomposition of the operator : @xmath419 where @xmath248 is the fourier transform of the smearing integral on the horizon .",
    "this expression is the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) ) , but now the integral is performed over all timelike momenta @xmath420 . because of the smearing , the integral is dominated by momenta which point nearly in the @xmath256 direction . since @xmath421 ,",
    "the integral falls off in the @xmath256 direction like @xmath422 .",
    "this is divergent for all permitted values of @xmath416 .",
    "consequently no operator can be defined . unlike the free case , it is no longer possible to improve the situation by taking @xmath216 derivatives , since the @xmath256 and @xmath259 directions are no longer related by the null mass shell condition .",
    "similar arguments rule out operators formed from interacting fields with spin @xmath423 , where @xmath345 transforms in a spin-@xmath424 irrep .",
    "let the conjugate field be written @xmath425 .",
    "in this case it is necessary ( but not always sufficient ) to satisfy the unitary bound that the primary have weight @xmath426 for an @xmath418 @xcite .",
    "the absolute square of the field smeared on the horizon looks like : @xmath427 where @xmath428 is the scalar product of the spins @xmath345 and @xmath429 in the little group @xmath430 that preserves the momentum @xmath250 . at fixed @xmath259 and large @xmath256 , @xmath431 can scale like @xmath432 where @xmath433 depends on the weight of the particular polarization under lorentz boosts .",
    "this integral is still divergent .",
    "so it is also impossible to construct @xmath14 from fields of higher spin .",
    "nevertheless , this does not entirely rule out the possibility that there might be a nontrivial horizon algebra @xmath14 , so long as it is constructed from operators that do not come from smearing local fields . as an analogy",
    ", there exist cft s in which fields can not be defined by smearing on a @xmath434 dimensional spacelike surface @xmath0 .. ] nevertheless , one can still define a local algebra on an incomplete spatial surface @xmath0 by means of the hodge duality @xmath435 , i.e. by defining @xmath436 to include any operator which commutes with all observables that are spacelike separated from @xmath0 .",
    "it may be that some similar trick can be used to define the observables on a null surface .    a possible argument that @xmath14 should exist",
    "is that in a cft there is no distinction between finite and infinite distances .",
    "consequently , one can apply a weyl rescaling @xmath437 with the property that the affine distance to the horizon becomes infinite . because curvature has mass dimension @xmath87 , this",
    "also should lead to the scaling away of any curvature effects .",
    "the existence of an algebra on the horizon is now equivalent to the existence of final scattering observables for particles travelling into this new , nearly flat asymptotic region .",
    "this converts the ultraviolet problem of null restriction to the infrared problem of final scattering states .",
    "however , because a cft has no mass gap , there are long range interactions , and the asymptotic states might not form a fock space , due to the possibility of creating an infinite number of soft massless particles . in order to apply the proof of the gsl in section [ arg ]",
    ", one would need to show that despite the existence of these long range forces , the final scattering algebra can be decomposed into a part associated with @xmath1 and a part associated with @xmath88 : @xmath438 and also show that @xmath14 obeys the other three axioms : ultralocality , local lorentz invariance , and stability .",
    "if there are any qft s in which the algebra @xmath14 does not exist , extending the proof would presumably require a more delicate near - horizon limit .",
    "one would have to show that a small smearing of fields out from the horizon does not break the symmetry group of the horizon sufficiently to spoil the proof .",
    "further generalization of the proof is necessary when the gravity theory goes beyond the einstein theory , either because the matter fields are nonminimally coupled , or because there are higher curvature terms in the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "in general , the presence of such terms will not only change the metric field equations , but also lead to the addition of extra terms in the horizon entropy @xmath3 .",
    "these corrections can be calculated for stationary black holes by means of the wald noether charge method @xcite ; however , there are certain ambiguities which arise for the case of dynamically evolving horizons . except for some special cases like @xmath439 gravity ( which can be related by field redefinitions to scalar fields",
    "minimally coupled to general relativity @xcite ) it is unknown whether such theories even obey a classical second law , let alone a generalized one .",
    "for example , it appears that the wald entropy can decrease when black holes merge in lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "although the present work is restricted to the einstein theory , some insight into these problems might be gained by analyzing the structure of horizon observables in non - einstein theories .",
    "the reason why the gsl holds on black holes in general relativity is that @xmath14 is small enough to have lots of symmetry ( local lorentz invariance ) and yet large enough to contain all the information falling across the horizon ( determinism ) . in general",
    ", alternative gravities will require @xmath14 to depend on additional information besides the metric and affine parameter on the horizon , e.g. curvature components .",
    "if this additional information breaks the ability to translate each horizon generator independently , this may account for the failure of the second law in these theories .",
    "another reason why theories may fail to obey the second law is if the theory permits negative energy excitations , violating the stability axiom .    on the other hand , if a horizon field theory for matter and gravitons can be found which still obeys all four axioms used in section [ arg ] ,",
    "this is auspicious for the gsl .",
    "it might be that the ambiguities in the wald noether charge can be fixed by requiring that @xmath3 depend only on quantities measurable in @xmath14 itself .",
    "suppose that this were done .",
    "then the gsl might be shown by the following argument :    first we need an analogue of eq .",
    "( [ tint ] ) , relating the horizon entropy to the boost energy falling across the horizon : @xmath440 but the wald noether charge method shows that this is true in any classical diffeomorphism invariant theory when @xmath34 is interpreted as a _",
    "canonical _ stress - energy current @xcite .",
    "( the `` gravitational '' stress energy tensor defined by varying with respect to the metric is not very meaningful at this level of generality , because it is not invariant under field redefinitions of the metric ) .",
    "wald s argument is classical , so in order to use eq .",
    "( [ sint ] ) , one would have to show that it survives a semiclassical quantization of the matter fields .    since the canonical stress - energy tensor generates diffeomorphisms , one can also rewrite eq .",
    "( [ sint ] ) in terms of @xmath80 , the generator of boost symmetries about a horizon slice with @xmath441 : @xmath442    since the canonical stress - energy tensor is the generator @xmath39 of boost symmetries , by the bisongano - wichmann theorem , the quantum fields should be in a thermal state with respect to @xmath39 . assuming that a non - einstein gravity theory satisfies each of the criteria described above",
