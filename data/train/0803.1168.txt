    "<S> we use qcd sum rules to study the possible existence of a @xmath0 molecule with the quantum number @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight and work at leading order in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath3 around 100 mev above the mass of the meson @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed state is a natural generalized state to the strangeness sector of the @xmath4 , which was also found to be consistent with a multiquark state from a previous qcd sum rule analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent appearance of new resonances observed by babar , belle , cleo and focus collaborations , and partly confirmed by the fermilab experiments cdf and d0 , sheds new light on the spectroscopy of charmonium states . among these new mesons , </S>",
    "<S> some have their masses very close to the meson - meson threshold like the @xmath4 @xcite and the @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of special importance is the appearance of the @xmath5 , which decays into @xmath6 and @xmath7 and , therefore , can not be described as ordinary @xmath8 meson . </S>",
    "<S> its nature is completely open , but an intriguing possibility is the interpretation as tetraquark state or molecular state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if these mesons are really molecular states , then many other molecules should exist . a systematic study of these molecular states and their experimental observation would confirm its structure and provide a new testing ground for qcd within multiquark configuration . </S>",
    "<S> in this context a natural extension would be to probe the strangeness sector . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in analogy with the meson @xmath4 , a @xmath9 molecule with @xmath1 would decay into @xmath10 and , therefore , could be easily reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the qcd sum rules @xcite to predict the mass of such a molecular state .    </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is of particular importance for new upcoming experiments which can investigate with much higher precision the charmonium energy regime , like the panda experiment at the antiproton - proton facility at fair , or a possible super - b factory experiment . </S>",
    "<S> especially panda can do a careful scan of the various thresholds being present , in addition to precisely going through the exact form of the resonance curve .    in a previous calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the qcdsr approach was used to study the @xmath4 considered as a diquark - antidiquark state @xcite , and the @xmath5 meson , considered as a @xmath11 molecular state @xcite . in both cases a very good agreement with the experimental mass was obtained .    considering a @xmath12 molecule with @xmath1 , a possible current describing such state </S>",
    "<S> is given by : j_=i , [ field ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are color indices . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the anti - symmetrical state @xmath15 to keep a closer relation with the @xmath4 meson . </S>",
    "<S> considering the @xmath4 as a @xmath16 molecule , the combination @xmath17 has @xmath18 as the @xmath4 meson . </S>",
    "<S> of course the symmetrical combination : @xmath19 would provide exactly the same mass , within our sum rule approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule is constructed from the two - point correlation function : _ ( q)=id^4x  e^iq.x0    vector current is not conserved , the two functions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) are independent . </S>",
    "<S> they have respectively the quantum numbers of the spin 1 and 0 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we choose to work with the lorentz structure @xmath22 , since it gets contributions only from the @xmath23 state .    on the ope side , we work at leading order in @xmath2 in the operators and consider the contributions from condensates up to dimension eight . the correlation function , @xmath20 , in the ope side can be written as a dispersion relation : _ </S>",

    "<S> d. [ dim8 ] where the integration limits are given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and we have used @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting to notice that the current in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ field ] ) has a ope behavior very similar to the scalar - diquark axial - antidiquark current used for the @xmath4 meson in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 2po ] ) : _ 1^phen(q^2)=ds ^phen(s)s - q^2 + , [ phen ] where @xmath31 is the spectral density and the dots represent subtraction terms . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density is described , as usual , as a single sharp pole representing the lowest resonance plus a smooth continuum representing higher mass states : ^phen(s)&=&^2(s-^2 ) + ^cont(s ) , [ den ] where @xmath32 gives the coupling of the current to the meson @xmath9 : [ eq : decay ] 0 | j|d_sd^*=.    for simplicity , it is assumed that the continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath33 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ den ] ) , vanishes bellow a certain continuum threshold @xmath34 . above this threshold , it is assumed to be given by the result obtained with the ope . therefore , one uses the ansatz @xcite ^cont(s)=^ope(s)(s - s_0 ) ,    after making a borel transform to both sides of the sum rule , and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side , the sum rules for the pseudoscalar meson @xmath35 , up to dimension - eight condensates , can be written as : ^2e^-^2/m^2=_4m_c^2^s_0ds   e^-s / m^2  </S>",
    "<S> ^ope(s ) + ^m_s^2(m^2 ) + ^mix(m^2 ) ,    to extract the mass @xmath36 we take the derivative of eq .  ( [ sr ] ) with respect to @xmath37 , and divide the result by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sr ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the values used for the quark masses and condensates are @xcite : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the sum rules in the borel range @xmath43 , and in the @xmath34 range @xmath44 gev .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figconvtcc ] we see that we obtain a reasonable ope convergence for @xmath45 gev@xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we fix the lower value of @xmath47 in the sum rule window as @xmath48 gev@xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the ope convergence in this case is similar to the ope convergence for the @xmath4 meson @xcite , and not so good as the ope convergence for the @xmath5 meson @xcite .    to get an upper limit constraint for @xmath47 we impose that the qcd continuum contribution should be smaller than the pole contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between pole and continuum contributions for @xmath49 gev is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figpvc ] . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum for @xmath50 . the maximum value of @xmath47 for which this constraint is satisfied depends on the value of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis for the other values of the continuum threshold gives @xmath51 gev@xmath46 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev@xmath46 for @xmath54 . in our numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we shall then consider the range of @xmath47 values from 1.9 @xmath55 until the one allowed by the pole dominance criteria given above .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figmx ] , we show the @xmath9 meson mass , for different values of @xmath56 , in the relevant sum rule window , with the upper validity limits indicated . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> we see that the results are very stable as a function of @xmath47 .    using the borel window , for each value of @xmath34 , to evaluate the mass of the @xmath9 meson and then varying the value of the continuum threshold in the range @xmath44 gev , we get = ( 3.970.08 )  , [ zmass ] around 100 mev bigger than the mass of the @xmath4 meson . </S>",
    "<S> the borel curve for the mass is quite stable and has a minimum within the relevant borel window . </S>",
    "<S> such stable borel curve strongly suggests that there is indeed a very well defined ground state .    to check the dependence of our results with the value of the charm quark mass , we fix @xmath57 and vary the charm quark mass in the range @xmath58 . using @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> we get : @xmath60 , in agreement with the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zmass ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the most important sources of uncertainty in our calculation are the values of the continuum threshod and the charm quark mass .    in conclucion , we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the two - point function for a possible @xmath61 molecular state with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this state would decay into @xmath10 and , therefore , could be easily reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> our finding strongly suggests the possibility of the existence of such molecular resonance , whose structure is similar to the @xmath4 , with a mass about 100 mev above that of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass of our proposed state is also close to the newly discovered @xmath62 @xcite and @xmath63 @xcite . while our proposed state has stangeness , the two states do not . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while @xmath62 was found in the decay of @xmath64 and is a candidate for @xmath65 , @xmath63 was found in @xmath66 and is consistent with @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a comparative study with these particles can give us clues on the structures of @xmath4 and our proposed state .    </S>",
    "<S> as a final remark , one can notice that if we take @xmath68 , one obtains the sum sule for the @xmath4 meson , considered as a molecular state @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are very similar to the ones obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but more stable as a function of the borel mass . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath70 one obtains @xmath71 , in an excelent agreement with the experimental value . </S>"
