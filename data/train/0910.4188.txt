    "we have used the expressions ( [ eqn : iq0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : i1 ] ) for the entropic functionals of the involved laguerre polynomials .",

    "therein , we have assumed without any loss of generality that @xmath140 .",
    "we observe that @xmath141&<&l_{q_2}^r[\\rho_n ] , \\quad \\text{for } q_1>q_2,\\\\ l_q^r[\\rho_{n_1}]&<&l_q^r[\\rho_{n_2 } ] , \\quad \\text{for }   n_1<n_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , the renyi lengths increase with @xmath21 , since the wavefunction expands . however , as a function of @xmath1 , they present a monotonic decreasing behaviour , tending to a constant value for large values of @xmath1 what seems to indicate a saturation of the information given by this measure .",
