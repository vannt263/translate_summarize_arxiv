    "the possibility of `` large extra dimensions '' , i.e. , with ( at least ) one compactification radius close to the current validity limit of newton s law of gravitation ( @xmath0 1 mm ) , raises considerable interest .",
    "it could also solve the hierarchy problem by providing us with a new fundamental scale at an energy possibly as small as 1 tev @xcite .",
    "neutrino physics is a favorite area to study this possibility .",
    "a right - handed , sterile neutrino does not experience any of the gauge interactions that require the confinement of the other standard model particles to our four - dimensional brane ; it is thus , other than the graviton , an ideal tool to probe the `` bulk '' of space . unconventional patterns of neutrino masses and oscillations arise , taking advantage of the possibility that the flavor neutrinos confined to our space can now interact with the bulk states that appear to us ( due to compactification of the extra dimensions ) as so - called kaluza - klein towers of states @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite have shown that , at least partially , it is possible to accommodate experimental constraints on neutrinos within this setup .",
    "we explore further possibilities , focusing on the unique properties of the model .",
    "quite specifically , neutrinos in this scheme can `` escape '' for part of the time to extra dimensions , resulting in a reduced average probability of detection in our world . while similar in a way to a fast unresolved oscillation between flavor and sterile neutrinos , this differs both by the time development of the effect and by the possible depth of the suppression .    in sec .",
    "[ s : sec2 ] , we address the analytical aspects of neutrino oscillations in the simplest toy model of one flavor neutrino coupling to one massless bulk fermion , i.e. , to its tower of states .",
    "we recall the main equations and reinvestigate the neutrino survival probability in order to obtain its correct behavior at large @xmath1 .",
    "we review the experimental constraints for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 and inquire whether this toy model can accommodate them for @xmath2 or for @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the msw matter effects in the sun are inescapable for the @xmath2 .",
    "however , as the large @xmath1 behavior of the survival probability leads naturally to an energy independent spectrum , we further explore the possibility of accounting for the solar neutrino data by a global suppression free from msw effects .",
    "this can be achieved by extending the toy model to include a second active neutrino .    in sec .",
    "[ s : sec3 ] , we thus propose an enlarged model that includes two generations of flavor neutrinos , both coupling to the same bulk fermion . in this scheme ,",
    "partial disappearance of both flavor neutrinos as well as oscillations between them become possible .",
    "we find the region of parameters that solve the electronic neutrino problem , and then show that the @xmath4 constraints , except the lsnd result , can simultaneously be accounted for .",
    "the simplest model is constituted by one left handed neutrino @xmath5 ( either of @xmath6,@xmath7,@xmath8 ) which lives in our 3 + 1 dimensional world coupled with one singlet bulk massless fermion field . since the latter lives in all dimensions , from our world s point of view",
    ", it appears after compactification as a kaluza - klein tower , i.e. , an infinite number of four - dimensional spinors .",
    "already in five dimensions , dirac spinors necessarily involve left and right - handed states ( chirality is defined here in 3 + 1 dimensions ) ; both will thus be present in the kaluza - klein tower .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on a reduction of the theory from 4 + 1 to 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "however , to guarantee a low scale for the unification of gravity with all forces , more extra dimensions are needed .",
    "we will assume that their compactification radii are small enough that they do not affect the analysis .",
    "the pattern is now well established ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and we will only recall the basic equations and results .    the action used is the following : @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the extra dimension .",
    "the yukawa coupling between the usual higgs scalar , the weak eigenstate neutrino @xmath5 , and the bulk fermion operates at @xmath12 , which is the 3 + 1 dimensional brane of our world .",
    "the fifth dimension is taken to be a circle of radius @xmath13 .",
    "as usual , the bulk fermion @xmath14 is expanded in eigenmodes .",
    "one then integrates over the fifth dimension .",
    "eventually , one has to diagonalize the mass matrix ( eigenvalues noted @xmath15 ) and write the neutrino in terms of the mass eigenstates @xmath16 where @xmath17 measures the strength of the yukawa coupling factor , as in  @xcite . ] .",

    "we give here a succinct description of the survival amplitude and probability .",
    "our main goal is to understand their behavior at large @xmath24 , i.e. , at large @xmath25 ratio .",

    "fig : meanprob ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting another interpretation of this result . indeed ,",
    "if we suppose instead that the phases in ( [ anu1nu1 ] ) are uncorrelated , i.e. , random frequencies , and perform an average on a set of phase values , we recover the expressions ( [ probmoy],[fluctu ] ) .",
    "this means the frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ anu1nu1 ] ) , although quasiharmonic , do not impose a periodic behavior to the survival probability , especially at large @xmath34 .",
    "the only harmonic leftover consists in very narrow ( and thus phenomenologically irrelevant ) periodic peaks in @xmath47 .     and fluctuations @xmath48 as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "the dashed lines give the small @xmath34 ( @xmath49 , and the large @xmath34 ( @xmath50 ) approximations . ]",
    "briefly , at large @xmath24 , the survival probability @xmath41 has two regimes .    for small @xmath34 ,",
    "the result is dominated by a constant @xmath51 , to which an oscillatory term of frequency @xmath52 is added .",
    "at large @xmath34 , the survival probability drops quickly to reach its large @xmath24 regime : a high frequency fluctuation around its mean value @xmath53 . from a physical point of view , in both cases it is safe to average the survival probability to its mean value if the size of the detector or the source is large ( typically @xmath54 ) .",

    "clear , because the @xmath1 ratio spans less than one order of magnitude .",
    "strong , because the @xmath1 ratio is large ( actually larger than for the k2k experiment ) and the experiment does not observe any suppression with high precision : @xmath57 , at 90% c.l .",

    "the highest experimental precision is reached by superkamiokande@xcite .",
    "we however stress that a sizable uncertainty still lies in the nuclear cross section@xcite of the reaction @xmath58 , resulting in a 20% uncertainty in superkamiokande .",
    "therefore , the gallium experiments and superkamiokande together could be accounted for by a global suppression ( neutrino disappearance of 40 to 60% , within the ssm uncertainty ) .",
    "homestake has a lower value , but is in addition sensitive to the be lines , for which direct information will only be provided by the upcoming sno and borexino experiments .",
    "superkamiokande searched for but did not observe any other effect at its current sensitivity : no spectral distortion ( hep ) neutrinos@xcite . ] , no seasonal effect , no day - night effect .",
    "a global , energy and distance independent suppression is thus not an unreasonable explanation of the observed solar neutrino deficits .    the atmospheric @xmath2 flux , observed by superkamiokande@xcite , does not show any distance or energy dependent suppression .",
    "the observed angular and energy dependence agrees with the expected one .",
    "the main uncertainty here lies in the absolute flux expectation .",
    "it turns out that at most 20 to 30% average suppression , without angular or energy dependence , is allowed by the combination of data and monte carlo calculations @xcite .",
    "more robust is the value of the double ratio @xmath59    we now turn to the discussion of the constraints on @xmath56 .",
    "the k2k experiment will soon give a constraint on @xmath60 almost as clean and strong as what chooz obtained for the @xmath2 survival probability .",

    ", we should also avoid msw effects in the sun or earth .    as the sun - earth system is a very long - baseline system and as the solar core is large",
    "( typically , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for solar neutrinos with @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 mm ) , the only observable effect will be an average suppression .",

    "the error bar at @xmath80 level combines quadratically the statistical and systematic errors ( see  [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the boxes can not slide to the left without getting into the range of the msw effect , showing thus a complete disagreement with the toy model . ]",
    "one could also ask whether it would be possible to fit the @xmath81 constraints in the toy model ( that is @xmath82 ) . figure  [ fig : numu11 ] shows that a good agreement with the experimental data can be obtained for @xmath83 .",
    "thus far , we have dealt only for atmospheric neutrinos with the vacuum propagation , neglecting the earth density effect .",
    "this is correct for low energy neutrinos ( say , less than 5 gev for a @xmath84 of @xmath85 ) , but must be revised for high energy particles where the resulting effective potential becomes determinant .",
    "in fact , this is the main reason why sterile neutrinos are now disfavored by the superkamiokande experiment in the usual ( purely four - dimensional ) case @xcite .",
    "namely , while a small @xmath84 guarantees the desired oscillations and large mixing angle in vacuum , the large effective mass difference between @xmath86 and @xmath64 or @xmath87 due to the earth s presence lifts the near degeneracy and in practice blocks the oscillations when the density is sufficient . in the four - dimensional case , this occurs for both @xmath88 s and @xmath89 s , and results in a contradiction with high energy data ( upward through - going muons and partially contained events ) .",
    "another but rather weaker constraint comes from the multiring , nc enriched sample .",
    "what is the situation in the extra - dimensional case ?",
    "we differ from the standard case by the presence of a tower of states .",
    "this means that , whatever the density , high energy @xmath89 s will always find a state to oscillate to .",
    "the effect will thus be at most 1/2 of that expected in the standard situation , with little suppression in the @xmath88 s and large suppression in the @xmath89 s .",
    "we are thus confident that no serious contradiction occurs .",
    "a detailed simulation of the earth and angular acceptances is beyond the scope of this paper and will be attempted when we have explored further the full parameter space ( which may include additional mass terms for the bulk and/or brane fermions  @xcite ) .",

    "to solve the solar neutrino puzzle , we now extend the toy model to include a second neutrino in four - dimensional space . we will call @xmath2 and @xmath92 the two neutrinos states living in 4 dimensions ( we will later discuss the possibility @xmath93 ) .",
    "the coupling of the flavor neutrinos to the bulk neutrino is chosen in a particularly economical way , the lagrangian being @xmath94    therefore , from the four - dimensional point of view , only one linear combination of the two flavor neutrinos , which we call as previously @xmath95 , will be coupled to the kaluza - klein tower associated with the bulk fermion @xmath14 .",
    "namely , @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . and @xmath101 are simply mass parameters without any link to the charged fermion masses . ]",

    "the filled region gives the allowed @xmath113 values . ]    for small values of @xmath103 , @xmath111 is mainly @xmath114 , so that the allowed values of @xmath115 range from 0.3 to 0.42 . for higher values of @xmath115 indeed , the electronic neutrino survival probability drops under 40% , while for lower values , it does not decrease below 60% . as the mixing angle @xmath103 increases ,",
    "the proportion of the decaying component of @xmath95 diminishes , so that the allowed range for @xmath116 gets enlarged . finally , if @xmath103 is too big ( @xmath117 approximately ) , the decaying component of @xmath111 is insufficient to explain the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "the next constraint comes from the chooz nuclear reactor experiment . as seen before ,",
    "the @xmath118 produced in the reactor with a typical energy of 2 mev show no disappearance at a distance @xmath119 km .    for given @xmath34 and @xmath109 , a maximum admissible value of @xmath24 , or equivalently , a minimum value of @xmath13 ( the radius of the compactified extra dimension ) results .",
    "the value of @xmath24 increases with @xmath103 at given @xmath115 , but decreases with @xmath115 at fixed @xmath103 .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath120 controls the typical mass difference between two consecutive kaluza - klein levels .",
