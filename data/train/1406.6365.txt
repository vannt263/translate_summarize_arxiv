    "in the two sub - sections below we distinguish between jets and hotspots to simplify comparison to the literature .    _",
    "double - jet or core - jet scenarios_a possible interpretation of the double flat - spectrum structure of j1502s is that we observe the synchrotron self - absorbed bases of a pair of oppositely directed jets from a single agn .",
    "similar structures have been seen in nearby type - ii agn , as well as in the galactic x - ray binary system ss433@xcite .",
    "we may exclude this scenario for a number of reasons .    1 .",
    "we do not see elongated core - jet structure in either of the two components , which is contrary to what is typical of self - absorbed agn cores .",
    "we would not expect these to be unresolved at vlbi scales given the fact that the two components are separated by 26  milli - arcseconds , and the separation between the two jet sides should be comparable to the size of the core itself@xcite .",
    "the 138  pc physical separation between the two components is an order of magnitude larger than the typical size of radio cores ( @xmath01 - 10 parsec ) seen in the brightest agn@xcite .    _",
    "double - hotspot or core - hotspot scenarios _ there are a number of arguments against the scenario where the two compact j1502se / w components are hotspots as observed in the class of compact symmetric objects ( csos ) ; or alternatively that one component is a hotspot and the other the core .",
    "we outline the most important points below .    1",
    ".   both components have flat spectra , which is uncharacteristic of hotspots which have typical spectral indices of @xmath65@xcite .",
    "spectral indices are even steeper for csos with a projected linear size ( hotspot separation ) greater than @xmath0100  pc@xcite .",
    "the population of csos have typical luminosities of 10@xmath66  whz@xmath4 , which is 4 orders of magnitude larger than j1502se / w@xcite .",
    "while this may be a selection effect , the lowest luminosity cso that we have found in the literature has a 1.4 ghz radio luminosity that is 1 order of magnitude larger than that of j1502se / w@xcite .",
    "3 .   similar to the double - jet / core - jet scenario",
    "discussed in the previous section , higher frequency observations probe nearer the base of the jet since it becomes optically thin closer to the central black hole@xcite . in the core - hotspot scenario where the distance is as large as 138  pc , this would result in a observable frequency dependent core - shift ( i.e. decreasing separation between the two components ) which we do not see : the separation of j1502se and j1502sw appears independent of observing frequency .",
    "4 .   in the double - hotspot scenario",
    ", there is no core emission detected ( to @xmath67  whz@xmath4 ) .",
    "the straight @xmath02 kpc long inner jet of j1502s has a 45 degree misalignment with the vector between j1502se / w .",
    "this would imply a dramatic , almost instantaneous change in angular momentum .",

    "if we assume that the jet axis is in the plane of the sky and a very conservative jet speed of 0.01 - 0.1c , the shift in momentum must have occurred within the last @xmath68  years . for a nominal radio source lifetime of @xmath010@xmath69  years , this represents a 0.02 - 0.2 percent probability .",

    "so in summary , in order for a core - hotspot or double - hotspot alternative to be true , the hotspot(s ) would not only need to have highly uncharacteristic flat spectral indices ( and potentially an order of magnitude larger core size compared to what is observed in the highest luminosity radio sources ) ; but also to have been observed almost instantaneously after a major shift in angular momentum has occurred .",

    "<S> the high brightness temperatures , flat spectra , and co - spatial centroids ( of both j1502se and j1502sw ) at both frequencies strongly support that these two radio components are associated with two separate , accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternative scenarios are discussed and ruled out in the methods section . </S>",
    "<S> arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) large array observations at 15.7 ghz suggest that the two radio cores ( j1502se / w ) flatten the overall j1502s spectrum at higher frequency ( see fig .  4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the location and close proximity of the two flat - spectrum nuclei support the view that the `` s''-shaped radio emission is a modulation ( or bending ) of one pair of jets associated with one of the nuclear components . </S>",
    "<S> this type of `` s - shaped '' structure is commonly attributed to precessing jets , with a resulting radio - jet morphology similar to the famous x - ray binary ss433@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> j1502p has a measured black hole mass of @xmath16  @xmath17@xcite , which is consistent with the black hole to bulge mass ( @xmath18 ) relation@xcite . if the same is true for j1502s , this implies that j1502se / w both have black hole masses of @xmath010@xmath19  m@xmath2 and each have a sphere of influence of @xmath010  pc ( the radius at which the black hole dominates the gravitational potential relative to the host galaxy ) . </S>",

    "<S> if a circular orbit of radius @xmath20  parsec and a black hole binary mass of @xmath21  m@xmath2 are assumed , the maximum expected velocity offset between j1502se / w is @xmath22  kms@xmath4 which is within the measured j1502s [ oiii ] line width of 384  kms@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> given that the original j1502 + 1115 selection was based on double - peaked [ oiii ] lines separated by 657 kms@xmath4 , it is clear that neither the double - peaked [ oiii ] or the double - cored near - infrared imaging played any part in the selection of the much closer binary smbh within j1502s . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the only major selection criteria _ for the close - pair binary within j1502s _ are _ k_-band magnitude ( _ k _ @xmath0 14 - 16 ) ; redshift ( @xmath23 ) ; and integrated 1.4  ghz flux density ( @xmath24  mjy ) . based on simulations for radio continuum sources@xcite , we expect a sky density of 5 such galaxies per square degree . </S>",
    "<S> given that one sub - kpc binary was found from targeting six objects , this implies a sky density of @xmath25  deg@xmath26 for the given selection criteria , where we quote the formal poisson 1@xmath27 uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> future vlbi surveys will be required to confirm this , given that the estimate is made from just six objects . while previous vlbi observations find a small fraction of dual / binary agn@xcite , they typically target bright sources which are usually associated with the most massive black holes ( @xmath28 ) for which there is a low probability of a similarly massive companion black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> to date , there are very few confirmed dual / binary agn , despite the expectations from our understanding of hierarchical structure formation through galaxy merging , combined with the observational evidence that every massive galaxy hosts a central smbh@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of the dual / binary agn with direct imaging confirmation , only three have sub - kpc projected separations and these systems are all below @xmath29@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these , there are a handful of candidate close - pair binaries based on light curve analyses , double - peaked broad lines and radio jet morphology@xcite , but these are not spatially resolved by current instruments . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show the projected spatial separations of the dual / binary agn against redshift for a sample of sources that have been confirmed or discovered by spatially - resolved x - ray , optical / infrared or radio imaging . while there may be a degree of subjectivity on which sources should appear in this list , it illustrates that the two vlbi - discovered systems have over an order of magnitude lower spatial separations relative to x - ray and optical / infrared observations at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the j1502se / w binary has a period of @xmath30  million years , assuming a circular orbit and major axis of 138  parsec . </S>",
    "<S> this period is comparable to the lifetime of a typical radio source ( @xmath010 million years ) .    </S>",
    "<S> limited observational constraints exist on the abundance of triple black hole systems . </S>",
    "<S> there are only five triple agn candidates with their lowest ( @xmath31 ) and second lowest ( @xmath32 ) projected separations below 10  kpc ( _ sub-10kpc systems _ hereafter ) , which is the approximate effective radius for an elliptical galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the lowest and second lowest projected separations for all the candidate triple agn systems found in the literature ( 8 in total for separations @xmath33  kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> six of the eight known triple systems ( and all the sub-10kpc systems ) have associated radio emission with 1.4 ghz luminosities that range from @xmath34 . like j1502 + 1115 , some of these triple systems have radio emission associated with multiple nuclei . from the literature and archival data we find that at least 9/15 ( @xmath3560  percent ) of the sub-10kpc smbhs have associated radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> this is a lower limit for two reasons : ( 1 ) sensitivity of the available observations ; and ( 2 ) some of the radio imaging available does not have sufficient angular resolution to resolve all three galaxies or nuclear cores in a triple system . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of triple agn with associated radio emission is significantly higher than the typical value of @xmath010 percent for agn@xcite , suggesting that triple systems lead to higher accretion activity and consequently a higher chance of jet triggering . </S>",
    "<S> none of the sub-10kpc systems were selected based on their radio emission , implying no clear biasing selection effects ( see details of host galaxies in methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for enhanced accretion has also been found for @xmath010 - 100  kpc separation , hard - x - ray - selected dual agn at low redshift@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with hydrodynamical simulations that find peak accretion and agn luminosity occurs at the smallest separations ( @xmath361 - 10  kpc)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above findings are therefore consistent with the expected disruption to gas dynamics caused by multiple black hole orbits .    </S>",
    "<S> multiple smbh in - spiral and recoil rates , as well as the resulting orbital eccentricities are predicted to dominate the stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum in the nhz-@xmath37hz range@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , constraints on the number density of triple systems is important to refine the strategy of the future pulsar timing array experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery demonstrates that high angular resolution radio observations have a unique advantage in searching for multiple black hole systems over large cosmological volumes , and therefore predicts that radio facilities like the square kilometre array ( as a standalone array or part of a vlbi network ) will lead to a dramatic increase in the number of known low separation ( @xmath381  kpc ) systems , as well as unresolved candidates for pointed gravitational wave experiments . </S>"
