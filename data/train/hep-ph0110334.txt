    "the origin of the spin in the proton is still a subject of debate .",
    "the last generation of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments has confirmed that the quarks account for only @xmath1 of the proton spin .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd fits of the @xmath2 structure function and semi - inclusive data suggest that the contribution of the gluon to the spin could be large  @xcite . a first attempt of a direct measurement of the polarised gluon distribution , @xmath3 , using leading charged particles  @xcite is not in conflict with this suggestion . in general",
    ", it has been concluded that major progress in our understanding of the spin structure can be made with clear and unambiguous direct measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    polarized @xmath0-colliders are particularly suited for this task .",
    "it has been demonstrated by the present unpolarized studies at hera that the large centre of mass system ( cms ) energy allows for several processes to be studied which show a clear sensitivity to the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "consequently one could expect that a powerful method to access @xmath3 is the measurement of di - jet rate asymmetries at high energy colliders of polarised electrons and protons .",
    "in lo two diagrams can lead to di - jet events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feynm ] ) : the photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) and the qcd - compton process .",
    "the pgf is directly sensitive to the gluon density , while the qcd - compton process is sensitive to the quark densities and constitutes the background .",
    "several feasibility studies on extracting the polarised gluon density @xmath3 from di - jet events at hera in lo have been performed during the last years and are summarized in  @xcite .",
    "these studies established the di - jet process as a prime candidate to access the polarised gluon directly . extracting @xmath3 at hera in nlo",
    "has been studied as well  @xcite .",
    "the studies have been extended to erhic and thera . in this paper",
    "we summarize the main results of these studies . in section  1",
    "we recall the results for hera .",
    "section  2 describes a first look at the potential of a combination of hera and a possible future linear collider at desy . in section  3",
    "we show in a somewhat greater detail what could be achieved at bnl , if a new accelerator for polarised electrons would be build , and its electrons would collide with the polarised protons from rhic .",
    "at hera 820 ( 920 ) gev protons collide with 27.5 gev electrons , providing a center - of - mass energy @xmath5  gev . studies of upgrading hera to a fully polarised @xmath0-collider are discussed in  @xcite . the potential of an extraction of @xmath3 in lo , assuming that both beams are @xmath6 polarised , is shown in figure  [ fig : heralo ] .",
    "the different assumptions for the particle density functions are the gehrmann - stirling ( gs ) sets a and c  @xcite , and the instanton - gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    for this study the monte carlo event generator pepsi 6.5  @xcite was used , which allowed to include hadronisation and detector effects .",
    "higher order effects were partly taken into account by unpolarised parton showers .",
    "the cuts chosen for this analysis are : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and two jets with a @xmath9  gev are required in the pseudo - rapidity region of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore a cut on the invariant mass of the two jets , @xmath11  gev , is applied .",
    "[ fig : heralo ] demonstrates that the polarised gluon is measurable in the @xmath12-range ( of the gluon ) of @xmath13 . note that this measurement allows the determination of the _ shape _ of @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore it reaches @xmath12-values lower than any other measurement planned in future so far , and ( for a gs - a type of gluon ) will measure about 75% of the first moment @xmath15 .",
    "the errors on the individual points on @xmath16 are in the range of 0.007 to 0.1 .",
    "the total error on @xmath17 in the complete range is 0.02 .",
    "these studies have been extended to nlo  @xcite , using the mepjet  @xcite and disent  @xcite programs .",
    "mepjet is used since it includes the polarised jet cross sections in nlo ; disent is used to relate the @xmath18 reconstructed from the measured jet pair to the true @xmath19 of the gluon . to improve the correlation between these quantities ,",
    "the cuts were increased : two jets with @xmath20  gev and @xmath21  gev are required .",
    "generally the asymmetries are found to be smaller than in the lo case and @xmath19-values get shifted towards larger @xmath12 .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ fig : heranlo ] .",
    "the region of measurability now becomes @xmath22 , the measurement will be less precise than in lo , but still has a very significant discrimination power , even already for a luminosity of 200 pb@xmath23 .",
    "thera is a proposal to collide a 250 to 800  gev electron beam , delivered by a linear collider such as tesla , on the 920  gev proton beam of hera  @xcite .",
    "a di - jet study has been made in lo with mepjet to check the reach of thera  @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : thera ] for jet selection cuts as for ( lo ) hera , and for the optimistic case of having a 800  gev electron beam on 820  gev protons .",
    "the plot is shown for a polarisation of the beams of 100% . at the lowest @xmath12-values the asymmetries get very small , i.e.  of order of 10@xmath24 , and become unmeasurable even with a statistics of 1  fb@xmath23 . but with a statistics in that ball - park",
    ", one can hope to measure @xmath14 about one order of magnitude lower in @xmath12 of the gluon compared to hera : the reach at thera is @xmath25 .",
    "recently , it has been suggested to add an electron ring or electron linac to the rhic rings  @xcite .",
    "the latter are presently being commissioned to provide a polarised proton beam of 250  gev .",
    "the polarised electron beam energy would be around 10  gev , leading to a total cms energy of 100  gev for this facility , baptised erhic , or eic ( electron ion collider ) .",
    "the reachable luminosity is expected to be very high for this collider , of the order of 4  fb@xmath23/year .",
    "a lo mepjet study was made for erhic .",
    "the jet selection cuts have been optimized for reaching largest sensitivity : two jets with a @xmath26  gev are required in the pseudo - rapidity region of @xmath27 and @xmath11  gev is required .",
    "the region in @xmath28 used is larger than for hera and thera , and will be a challenge for the detector design . with hera - like cuts some of the precision is lost , but the measurement is still very significant .",
    "fig.[fig : rhichera ] shows the asymmetries as function of @xmath19 for both hera and erhic , and the expected error bars for 1 fb@xmath23 , calculated with 100% polarisation .",
    "fig.[fig : glufig2 ] shows the statistical precision reachable for data samples with different luminosity , calculated with mepjet , and assuming @xmath6 polarisation for both beams .",
    "the figure also shows the sensitivity to the gluon distribution . clearly a good separation power between different models for @xmath3 is preserved .",
    "the polarised gluon can be measured in the region @xmath29 . for larger values",
    "the asymmetries to the qcd compton background are dominating and its use will depend on how well one can control this contribution .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in table  [ tab2 ] we present the @xmath12-values of possible measurements of @xmath3 and the corresponding sensitivities for two different values of the @xmath30 cut of the jets .",
    "hadronisation and detector effects are taken into account as correction factors determined by comparing mepjet and pepsi results , as studied for hera .",
    "these corrections inflate the errors by 40 - 60% . lowering the jet @xmath30 is in particular important for reaching higher sensitivities in the low-@xmath12 region .",
    "finally we present a table with the sensitivities for hera and for erhic of measurable points with statistical errors , after taking into account effects of nlo , hadronisation and detector smearing .",
    "all effects are computed as correction factors to the lo mepjet results , determined from the detailed hera studies with pepsi and nlo mepjet / disent .",
    "the result of the @xmath12-values of the possible data points and their error is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for erhic the values correspond to the @xmath30-jets cut : @xmath31  gev .",
    "these numbers can be used e.g. in general qcd fits to @xmath2 data , by using the di - jet cross sections as a constraint on the gluon , as done e.g. in  @xcite for a lo study for a polarised hera .     & + @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath33 + 0.017 & 0.057 & 0.017 & 0.332 + 0.024 & 0.032 & 0.024 & 0.208 + 0.033 & 0.025 & 0.033 & 0.063 + 0.047 & 0.023 & 0.047 & 0.045 + 0.065 & 0.022 & 0.065 &",

    "in summary di - jet measurements at a future polarised @xmath0-collider will give important information on the shape and magnitude of the polarised gluon distribution of the proton .",

    "the global result is shown in fig .  [ fig : sumup ] , for hera and erhic and compared to results from other planned or possible future polarised experiments : @xmath35-scattering at rhic  @xcite ( star , @xmath36 gev , @xmath37 ) , @xmath38-scattering in compass  @xcite , and @xmath35-scattering in hera - n  @xcite , i.e. using the polarised protons of hera on a polarised fixed target .",
    "all measurements are shown at lo .",
    "clearly erhic can produce the ( statistically ) most precise measurements , and hera covers the range to lowest possible @xmath12-values which can only be beaten by thera , if it would be able to deliver sufficient luminosity ."
