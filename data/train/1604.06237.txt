    "there are advantages in the use of high dimensional entangled systems in quantum information processing and communication .",
    "such systems with dimensions larger than 2 allow for a higher information capacity @xcite and lead to increased security in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is an important resource in many quantum information protocols .",
    "however it is fragile , since it decays through interaction with noisy environments @xcite , such as atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states of photons are a suitable candidate for the implementation of high dimensional quantum systems for use in high dimensional quantum key distribution @xcite and long - range quantum communication @xcite through free - space .",
    "unlike the polarization of light , which offers a two - level hilbert space , the oam of photons provides an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . fortuitously , photonic states produced in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) are naturally entangled in their oam degrees of freedom due to the conservation of oam @xcite .",
    "the decay of oam entanglement in a qubit pair evolving in turbulence has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "these studies show that qubit oam entanglement decays slower in weak scintillation for modes with higher oam - values .",
    "while , the study of turbulence induced decay of oam entanglement in qubit pairs can help one to understand basic behavior of oam entanglement in turbulence , it offers little practical benefit over the use of the polarization states of single photons , which are less affected by turbulence .",
    "the point of using the oam states of light is to have high dimensional quantum states .",
    "therefore , it makes sense that one should consider high dimensional states in the oam basis for these studies .",
    "the effect of atmospheric turbulence on such high dimensional oam entanglement have received little attention .",
    "the only case where the evolution of oam entanglement for high dimensional quantum state has been considered , is a theoretical investigation involving qutrits @xcite .",
    "it appears that the effects of turbulence on the oam entanglement for high dimensional quantum states , have not yet been considered experimentally .    for this reason ,",
    "we report here on the theoretical and experimental results of a study into the effects of atmospheric turbulence on high dimensional oam entanglement . using spdc , we prepare photon pairs that are entangled in their oam degrees of freedom .",
    "one of these photons is propagated through turbulence , while allowing the other to propagate undisturbed through free - space ( without turbulence ) .",
    "the turbulence is implemented as a phase - only distortion on a single phase screen , using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) . by implication",
    ", we use the single phase screen ( sps ) approximation of the atmospheric scintillation process @xcite , which is only valid under weak scintillation conditions @xcite .",
    "inspite of this restriction , the sps model is still currently the most widely used model for the study of photonic quantum states propagating in turbulence @xcite .",
    "our results show a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "there are various aspects that pose challenges to the experimental study of the propagation of high dimensional oam entangled states through turbulence .",
    "to determine the high dimensional quantum state , one needs to perform a quantum state tomography , which requires a number of individual measurements that increases rapidly with the increasing number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the randomness of atmospheric turbulence , one has to repeat these measurements a reasonable number of times and average the results to obtain a meaningful statistical description of the evolution of the quantum state . in other words ,",
    "an investigation of the decay of high dimensional entanglement in turbulence is a very time consuming process . in our experiment",
    ", we consider qutrits  three - dimensional states  and performed a full state tomography for each output state obtained from different realizations and different strengths of the turbulence .",
    "while three - dimensional states allow us to observe the effects of high dimensions , we are able to perform the experiments over a reasonable period .",
    "an important purpose of this work is to show that we are able to obtain a good agreement between the theoretical predictions that one can compute using the sps approximation . here",
    ", we use the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) basis as the measurement basis , because it enables us to obtain relatively simple analytical expressions . for accurate comparison ,",
    "the experimental measurements need to implement precisely that which is assumed in the calculations . as a result we measure in the exact lg basis and not in the helical basis where the amplitude variation of the mode is ignored , apart from the gaussian envelop that is imposed by the overlap in the optical fibre . for this reason we use complex amplitude modulation @xcite on the slms to perform the projective measurements required for the quantum state tomography .",

    "in the experiment , we pass one of the photons through turbulence that is simulated by a random phase modulation using an slm . hence , the appropriate theory with which these experimental results are to be compared is the sps approximation . for the biphoton case with only one photon propagating through turbulence ,",

    "the pump is assumed to be a gaussian beam .",
    "the details of the phase matching function is not important , because , as it turns out , the experimental conditions are such that the phase matching function plays a diminished role .",
    "( see the discussion of the thin - crystal limit below . ) for that reason we follow @xcite and use the ( analytically more tractable ) gaussian function model to represent the phase matching function .",
    "the resulting spdc input state in the fourier domain can therefore be represented by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a normalization constant , @xmath29 is a two - dimensional spatial frequency vector ( related to the transverse propagation vector by @xmath30 ) , and the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the two ( ` signal ' and ` idler ' ) down - converted photons , respectively .",

    "this leads to the so - called _ thin crystal limit _ , where the phase matching function is only evaluated at the origin .",
    "it implies that one can set @xmath39 and drop the phase matching function in the calculations .",
