    "among the many problems which attend the canonical quantization of general relativity is the fact that all gauge - invariant quantities , which might qualify as observables , necessarily commute with the hamiltonian , and are therefore constants of the motion .",
    "this intriguing problem has received wide attention , which has been comprehensively reviewed , for example , in @xcite ( see also ) .",
    "it seems possible to obtain some insight into the `` problem of time '' from simple quantum - mechanical models which share with general relativity the essential feature of time - reparametrization invariance , and the purpose of the present work is to explore in some detail the interpretation of time evolution in one such model .",
    "it is widely thought that the time evolution of physical quantities which is apparent to actual observers in our universe should be understood , in some sense , as evolution relative to the state of a physical clock , which provides an observer s local definition of time .",
    "a particular implementation of this idea has been proposed by rovelli @xcite , who defines `` evolving constants of the motion '' by eliminating the arbitrary time coordinate @xmath0 in favour of the value of a physical clock variable .",
    "thus , in @xcite , he considers a model of two harmonic oscillators having the same frequency , whose equations of motion can be solved for two functions , say @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "neither of these functions gives a gauge - invariant description of time evolution , but by eliminating @xmath0 , rovelli arrives at a new function @xmath3 which is gauge invariant ( or almost so - see section 4 below ) provided that @xmath4 is regarded as a real parameter , rather than as a dynamical variable .",
    "classically , at least , this defines a family of observables , @xmath5 , which can be interpreted as the value of @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "however , the quantum - mechanical operator corresponding to @xmath5 is approximately self - adjoint ( and approximately obeys a standard heisenberg equation of motion ) only when restricted to a subspace of the physical hilbert space which rovelli calls the  schrdinger regime \" .",
    "since this is a large - quantum - number regime , he suggests that the notion of time evolution does not exist at a fundamental level , and emerges only as a semiclassical property of macroscopic objects .    in this paper , we study a model whose dynamical variables are an oscillator and a free particle , the latter serving as a clock whose reading is ( classically ) a measure of geometrical proper time .",
    "the classical and quantum dynamics of this model are discussed in section ii where , in order to obtain a well - defined quantum theory , the free particle is treated as the low - frequency limit of a second oscillator .",
    "we find it possible to define a parametrized family of observables @xmath8 evolving with a parameter @xmath9 which classically coincides with the geometrical proper time .",
    "the linearity of the clock variable turns out to be inessential for this purpose .",
    "moreover , this evolution is governed by an exact heisenberg equation of motion , and is not restricted to a macroscopic regime .",
    "the introduction of a clock variable permits time evolution by relaxing the energy constraint on the oscillator , and indeed the energy of the clock can saturate this constraint . in section iii",
    ", we investigate the possibility of a `` test clock '' by restricting the state of the clock to a narrow range , which approximately reproduces the constraint on the oscillator alone .",
    "this restriction imposes a limit on the resolution with which the value of @xmath8 can be determined , but there is a semiclassical limit in which both the energy of the clock and the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are fairly sharply defined .",
    "the interpretation of time is discussed in detail in section iv where , in particular , we point out that the clock can not itself be regarded as a physically observed object , but should rather be taken as representing the observer s intrinsic sense of time .",
    "consider the lagrangian @xmath10 defined on a @xmath11-dimensional manifold with `` time '' coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "the only geometrical variable is lapse function @xmath12 , which we take to be strictly positive .",
    "the action @xmath13 is easily seen to be invariant under a change of time coordinate , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is any increasing function of @xmath0 . the equations of motion @xmath18 obtained by varying @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the general solution @xmath21 so that the clock variable @xmath20 is linear in the proper time @xmath22 .",
    "the constraint @xmath23 obtained by varying @xmath24 implies the relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 .    for this model ,",
    "the solution space ( ignoring the factor @xmath27 of gauge functions @xmath12 , all of whose points are gauge equivalent ) is @xmath28 . with the parametrization @xmath29 the angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 )",
    "provide coordinates on @xmath34 , while @xmath35 is the coordinate on @xmath36 .",
    "the general solutions ( [ gensoln1 ] ) and ( [ gensoln2 ] ) can be written as @xmath37 and the presymplectic form on the solution space is @xmath38    as can be seen from ( [ gensoln3 ] ) and ( [ gensoln4 ] ) , time evolution is generated by the hamiltonian vector field @xmath39 associated with the constraint @xmath40 . as expected , we find that @xmath41 annihilates @xmath42 , @xmath43 , so the reduced phase space is found by identifying all points along each gauge orbit , which is an integral curve of @xmath41 .",
    "equivalently , points of the reduced phase space correspond to distinct gauge orbits .",
    "the angle @xmath30 is constant along each gauge orbit . for each value of @xmath30 ( except @xmath44 ) ,",
    "the orbits are helical curves on the cylinder @xmath45 coordinatized by @xmath31 and @xmath35 , with a period along @xmath36 of @xmath46 .",
    "distinct orbits can therefore be labelled by the values of @xmath35 in an interval of length @xmath46 , the end points of which are identified , since they belong to the same orbit .",
    "the set of distinct orbits is thus topologically @xmath47 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the gauge orbits are circles on the cylinder , and there is a distinct orbit for each @xmath49 . for @xmath50 , the amplitude of oscillation in ( [ gensoln3 ] )",
    "vanishes , so all values of @xmath31 are equivalent . in this case",
    ", the @xmath47 of gauge orbits collapses to a point .",
    "we see that the reduced phase space is the union of three sets :    1 .",
    "the open disk @xmath51 , which is the direct product of the interval @xmath52 with the circle @xmath47 , the circle at @xmath53 being contracted to a point .",
    "physically , states in this region are those in which the clock runs forwards .",
    "the gauge - invariant observables which distinguish the states are @xmath30 , which sets the amplitude of the @xmath19 oscillation and also ( via the constraint ) the rate of the clock , and @xmath35 , which characterises the phase of oscillation at which the clock reads zero",
    "the open disk @xmath54 , which is similar to @xmath51 , but corresponds to the interval @xmath55 and contains those states in which the clock runs backwards .",
    "3 .   the line @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this region ,",
    "the oscillation has its maximum amplitude , while the clock has a constant reading @xmath35 , which is the gauge invariant observable distinguishing the states .",
    "this reduced phase space is _ not _ a manifold - a fact which presents serious difficulties for the method of geometrical quantization , and we have not succeeded in obtaining a fully consistent quantum version of this model .",
    "a quantum theory of a related model will be described below . within the classical theory",
    ", we can construct gauge - invariant observables which evolve with proper time , as measured by the clock , by restricting attention to the subspace @xmath59 .",
    "consider that region of the solution space where @xmath60 and identify the points @xmath61 and @xmath62 . on the resulting space ,",
    "we replace the coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath31 with @xmath63 in terms of these coordinates , the generator ( [ xc ] ) of gauge orbits is @xmath64 and the presymplectic form ( [ omega ] ) becomes @xmath65 as expected , this @xmath42 is independent of @xmath66 , and is also the symplectic form on the region @xmath59 of the reduced phase space , now coordinatized by @xmath30 and @xmath67 .    with the coordinates @xmath68 , the solutions to the equations of motion read @xmath69 the quantity @xmath70 can be identified as the proper time which has elapsed since the clock read zero and ( with an obvious economy of notation ) the value of @xmath19 at this time is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 since they do not depend on @xmath66 , the quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 are gauge invariant .",
    "thus , if @xmath9 is regarded as a parameter , rather than as standing for the expression @xmath75 , then @xmath8 is a gauge - invariant function of @xmath9 .",
    "classically , this function can be interpreted as `` the value of @xmath19 at proper time @xmath9 '' , given that @xmath76 is located at the event @xmath77 .",
    "it is similar to the `` evolving constants of the motion '' defined by rovelli @xcite but with an important difference : whereas rovelli s evolution is with respect to the actual value of a physical clock variable , @xmath9 refers ( at the classical level ) to the geometrical proper time .",
    "the symplectic form can be expressed in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the satisfactory result @xmath78 so @xmath73 and @xmath74 have the canonical poisson bracket algebra .",
    "moreover , the evolution of @xmath8 is easily seen to be governed by the usual equation of motion @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the hamiltonian for the oscillator alone .    to obtain a quantum version of this model in a controlled manner",
    ", we consider the lagrangian @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an integer , with a view to recovering the model ( [ clocklagrangian ] ) in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the results are essentially independent of @xmath82 .",
    "the classical analysis is similar to that given above .",
    "if the solutions to the equations of motion are written as @xmath84 then the quantities @xmath85 have poisson brackets @xmath86 , which will shortly be promoted to commutators .",
    "the constraint @xmath87 can be solved in terms of the coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath67 and @xmath66 , replacing ( [ gensoln5 ] ) and ( [ gensoln6 ] ) with @xmath88    for any finite value of @xmath82 , the reduced phase space of this model is @xmath34 , the angles @xmath30 and @xmath67 ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) providing coordinates such that the points @xmath91 are opposite poles . in particular , for @xmath48 , the angle @xmath67 in ( [ gensoln9 ] ) is indistinguishable from @xmath66 , so all values of @xmath67 are gauge equivalent .",
    "each point of this phase space , of course , corresponds to a periodic oscillation , for which the values @xmath92 may be identified .",
    "the limit @xmath93 is actually singular , in the following sense . to achieve a finite limit in ( [ gensoln10 ] ) , with @xmath94",
    ", we may assume that @xmath95 either has a finite value , or differs by a finite amount from @xmath96 .",
    "in the limit , therefore , each point of the phase space @xmath34 represents two distinct solutions , corresponding to the half - periods of oscillation in which @xmath20 is an increasing or a decreasing function of @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , the two limits of ( [ gensoln10 ] ) differ by a sign , which can be regarded as the sign of @xmath30 , and correspond to the two regions @xmath98 of the phase space described above . to reproduce the region @xmath56",
    ", we must first take @xmath83 with @xmath60 and then take @xmath99 , with @xmath66 given by ( [ newcoords1 ] ) .    for finite values of @xmath82 ,",
    "the reduced phase space @xmath34 is a manifold , and the model can be quantized straightforwardly . however , since this manifold includes the point @xmath48 , we may anticipate some difficulty in interpreting the variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( equations ( [ x ] ) and ( [ p ] ) ) as operators on the physical hilbert space . since all values of @xmath67 are gauge equivalent at @xmath48 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( and hence also @xmath8 ) are not gauge - invariant functions on the reduced phase space , although they _ are _ gauge - invariant functions on any region which excludes the point @xmath48 .",
    "in any such region , the expressions ( [ newomega ] ) and ( [ omegaxp ] ) for the symplectic form are still valid , so @xmath73 and @xmath74 still have the canonical poisson algebra .",
    "models of this kind can be quantized in several more or less equivalent ways ( see , for example ) .",
    "the essential result is that one can identify gauge - invariant functions @xmath100 , on the reduced phase space , whose poisson algebra , @xmath101 is the lie algebra of @xmath102 , and the casimir invariant @xmath103 is proportional to the constraint @xmath40 .",
    "the physical hilbert space is therefore an irreducible representation of @xmath102 whose dimension is set ( up to operator ordering ambiguities ) by the value of @xmath104 . for our purposes",
    ", it is convenient to construct this hilbert space according to the dirac prescription , taking @xmath105 and @xmath106 as the basic variables ( a similar route is followed in ) .    on promoting @xmath105 and @xmath106 to quantum ladder operators , with the usual commutators @xmath107 = [ b , b^{\\dag } ] = 1 $ ] , @xmath108 = [ a , b^{\\dag } ] = 0 $ ] , we obtain an unconstrained hilbert space , spanned by the vectors @xmath109 , with @xmath110 @xmath111 the physical hilbert space is the subspace of vectors satisfying the constraint @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "here it is assumed that any constant arising from factor ordering in the constraint operator has been absorbed into @xmath104 .",
    "quantization clearly requires that @xmath114 be an integer , and we define @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are integers , with @xmath118 .",
    "this physical hilbert space is spanned by the vectors @xmath119    we would now like to realize @xmath73 and @xmath74 as gauge - invariant operators , acting in the physical hilbert space , but , as anticipated , this is not quite straightforward .",
    "classically , we can define variables @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with poisson bracket @xmath122 , by @xmath123 quantum - mechanically , the operator ordering @xmath124 ensures that these operators have the expected properties @xmath125 and @xmath126 , _ except _ that the action of @xmath127 on the maximal state @xmath128 is not well defined . to proceed , we introduce the regularized operators @xmath129 these are well - defined , gauge invariant operators , and we find in particular that @xmath130",
    ". we can now define operators @xmath120 and @xmath127 by @xmath131 these operators are also well defined and gauge invariant , but they have the anomalous commutator @xmath132 = 1 - \\theta\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath133 projects onto the maximal state : @xmath134 .",
    "the operators @xmath135 are well defined , gauge invariant and self - adjoint , but they have the anomalous commutator @xmath136 = i[a , a^{\\dag } ] = i(1-\\theta)$ ] .",
    "the anomalous term is nonzero only when acting on the maximal state @xmath128 , where the clock has the smallest energy allowed by the constraint ( [ constraint3 ] ) .",
    "classically , the interpretation of @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the position and momentum of the oscillator `` at time @xmath76 '' is ambiguous in the state @xmath48 , where the clock permanently reads zero , and therefore does not distinguish this instant of time , and the anomaly can be understood as reflecting this fact in the quantum theory .",
    "formally , the classical versions of ( [ areg ] ) and ( [ adagreg ] ) correspond to regularized variables @xmath137^{-n/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath138 .",
    "these are truly gauge - invariant quantities , having the unique values @xmath139 at @xmath48 , but do not have the canonical poisson algebra .",
    "however , they differ significantly from the original @xmath73 and @xmath74 only where @xmath140 is not much greater than @xmath141 , and when @xmath142 is sufficiently small , this is a small neighbourhood of the point @xmath48 .",
    "it is simple to show that @xmath143}&=&a\\\\ { [ } a^{\\dag},a^{\\dag}a{]}&=&-a^{\\dag}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it follows from the latter relations that the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath144 } \\label{heisenberg}\\ ] ] reproduces ( [ xoftau ] ) in the expected way , provided that the hamiltonian has the factor ordering @xmath145 .    at this point",
    ", we have a formalism which , taken at face value , is equivalent to ordinary time - dependent quantum mechanics . there is a physical hilbert space , spanned by the vectors @xmath146 , a set of operators @xmath147 on this space and a hamiltonian @xmath148 which generates time evolution through the standard equation of motion ( [ heisenberg ] ) . whether this formalism should be taken at face value is , of course , another matter , and the interpretation of the model",
    "will be discussed in section iv .",
    "apparently , one can ask , and answer , questions such as `` given that @xmath19 was determined to have the value @xmath6 at time @xmath149 , what is the probability that it has the value @xmath4 at time @xmath150 ? '' . acording to standard quantum mechanics ,",
    "this question is legitimate only if @xmath6 and @xmath4 are eigenvalues of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "because the classical range of @xmath19 is restricted by the constraint and , correspondingly , the physical hilbert space is finite- dimensional , these eigenvalues form a finite , discrete spectrum , which is easily found . using ( [ xofa ] ) , we can express @xmath8 as @xmath153 .",
    "the properties ( [ aonm ] ) and ( [ adagonm ] ) then imply that @xmath154 is an eigenvector of @xmath8 with eigenvalue @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the hermite polynomial , @xmath157 is a normalizing constant and , in order to truncate the series at @xmath158 , @xmath159 must be a zero of @xmath160 . since there are @xmath161 of these zeros , the states ( [ xeigenstates ] ) span the @xmath162-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "also , since @xmath163 , the eigenvalues of @xmath164 are @xmath165",
    ".    the quantum dynamics of this model can be illustrated by considering the coherent state @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a normalizing factor .",
    "the time - dependent wavefunction for this state is @xmath168 where @xmath169 . if @xmath170 , then @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the classical trajectory passing through @xmath173 .",
    "for an unconstrained oscillator ( corresponding to the limit @xmath174 ) , the coherent state is , of course , a gaussian wave packet , with @xmath175 , whose peak follows the classical trajectory .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ coherentwavefunction ] ) is defined only at the discrete values @xmath155 , and is not simply a function of @xmath176 . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xmath177 is well within the range defined by the largest and smallest @xmath155 then , even for quite small values of @xmath116 , these discrete values follow the gaussian packet rather closely , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "in classical general relativity , one can assess the physical characteristics of a spacetime by examining the trajectories of `` test particles '' which follow time - like geodesics , but do not contribute to the stress tensor .",
    "here we consider the possibility of a `` test clock '' , which might be used to reveal the time evolution of a quantum universe , without itself contributing significantly to the quantum dynamics . whether this notion is ultimately meaningful or useful depends on how the quantum theory is to be interpreted , and this",
    "is discussed in the following section .",
    "suppose , specifically , that the clock variable @xmath20 is deleted from the lagrangian ( [ clocklagrangian ] ) or ( [ clocklagrangian2 ] ) .",
    "classically , there seems to be a sense in which the state of the remaining oscillator evolves with proper time as @xmath178 , although @xmath8 can not be regarded as a gauge - independent observable . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the hilbert space contains only a single state , from which nothing corresponding to this apparent time evolution can be extracted . by adding the clock , we are able to obtain a genuine observable @xmath8 and a multi - dimensional hilbert space on which proper time evolution can be represented in a gauge - invariant manner . however , the energy constraint which applied to the original oscillator is relaxed by the presence of the clock , which can itself saturate the constraint .",
    "the idea now is to see whether the apparent time - dependence of the clockless model can be revealed by restricting attention to those states in which the clock has only small energies , so that the energy constraint of the clockless model is approximately realized .",
    "it may be anticipated that this restriction will impose a limit on the resolution with which values of @xmath8 can be determined , and we wish to examine the nature of this limit .    if there is to be a non - trivial time evolution , several states must still be available .",
    "we therefore consider a ( loosely ) semiclassical situation , with @xmath116 very large , taking a band of states with @xmath179 to be actually available for use .",
    "our calculations will now be approximate , and we begin by finding an approximation for the eigenstates ( [ xeigenstates ] ) .",
    "it is convenient at this point to use the schrdinger picture , and deal with the eigenstates @xmath180 of @xmath181 .",
    "when @xmath116 is large , the @xmath182 zeros of @xmath183 corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath8 lie roughly between @xmath184 and @xmath185 and the spacing between them is therefore of order @xmath186 .",
    "we will take these eigenvalues to form a continuum .",
    "for large @xmath187 , the asymptotic formula for @xmath156 @xcite , @xmath188 yields @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "taking @xmath116 to be of the form @xmath191 and @xmath192 in ( [ xeigenstates ] ) , replacing the sum on @xmath67 by an integral , and defining @xmath193 we obtain eigenstates of @xmath194 in the form @xmath195 which are orthonormal in the limit @xmath196 .",
    "ladder operators @xmath197 and @xmath198 are realized in this aproximation by @xmath199 because the maximal state annihilated by @xmath127 now has zero measure , these operators have the canonical commutator @xmath200 = 1 $ ] .",
    "for the same reason , the coherent state is now an eigenstate of @xmath120 .",
    "corresponding to the rescaled variable @xmath201 ( [ xi ] ) we define @xmath202 and obtain the usual wavefunction @xmath203 .",
    "supposing that the states actually available for use are those in a narrow range of @xmath67 , we introduce a window function @xmath204 and define approximate eigenstates of @xmath194 by @xmath205 in the same way , we can define an approximate coherent state @xmath206 where @xmath207 as in ( [ coherentwavefunction ] ) the time evolution of this state is obtained by making the replacement @xmath208 .    to obtain approximate analytical results , we define @xmath209 and choose a gaussian window function @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the appropriate normalization factor .",
    "we choose @xmath212 to be a little less than the maximal value @xmath213 , and assume that @xmath214 is small enough for the limits of integration to be extended to infinity . for the uncertainty @xmath215 , defined by @xmath216 , we find @xmath217 we see that , for a fixed window width @xmath214 , it is possible to make @xmath201 arbitrarily sharp when @xmath116 is sufficiently large . on the other hand , when @xmath214 is made small , in effect imposing the constraint of the clockless model , it becomes impossible to construct sharp eigenstates of @xmath201 , reflecting the fact that , without the clock , there is no gauge - invariant operator corresponding to @xmath73 or @xmath194 .",
    "given the coherent state @xmath218 , we can estimate the probability amplitude for finding the oscillator at the position @xmath201 at time @xmath9 .",
    "assuming that the limits of integration in ( [ approxwavefn ] ) can be extended to infinity , which will be valid if @xmath116 is large enough and if @xmath219 , where @xmath220 , we obtain @xmath221\\ ,                      \\label{probxiz}\\ ] ] where @xmath222 indicates the omission of a normalization factor and a phase .",
    "for a fixed window width @xmath214 , this amplitude becomes sharply peaked at the classical trajectory in the semiclassical limit @xmath223 .",
    "however , when @xmath214 becomes very small , then ( i ) there is no longer a sharp peak at the classical trajectory and ( ii ) the probability becomes time - independent .",
    "qualitatively , at least , we recover the situation in the absence of the clock , where there is no gauge - invariant operator corresponding to @xmath201 and all gauge - invariant amplitudes are time - independent ( except possibly for trivial phase factors ) .",
    "it is apparent from these results that , as expected , we can not fix the energy of the clock without losing both the observable @xmath201 and the time dependence which the clock was intended to reveal .",
    "however , it seems that one can find situations ( for example , by taking @xmath116 large , with @xmath224 fixed ) in which both the energy of the clock and the eigenstates of @xmath194 are fairly sharply defined , and in which the notion of a test clock is therefore meaningful .",
    "the absence of time - dependent observables in a time - reparametrization - invariant system can perhaps be understood by recognising that a complete description of a closed system is inevitably from the point of view of an observer external to the system . as viewed by such an observer ,",
    "the system has , say , @xmath225 dimensions , of which one corresponds to the `` time '' coordinate @xmath0 ( so the models considered in this paper have @xmath226 ) , and the `` time '' which passes inside the system is quite unrelated to any `` time '' experienced by this observer . for this observer",
    ", a state of the @xmath227-dimensional system corresponds to what an observer internal to the system might be supposed to regard as an entire history of a @xmath228-dimensional system .",
    "the observable quantities whose values distinguish one state of the system from another therefore characterise entire histories of the system , and can not evolve with time in any straightforward sense .    for a classical system which is _ not _ time - reparametrization invariant ,",
    "this does not normally present a problem .",
    "consider , for example , the model ( [ clocklagrangian ] ) with @xmath24 set equal to 1 .",
    "the general solutions to the equations of motion are of the form @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "there are four independent observables , @xmath231 , since a set of values for these quantities determines a history of the system .",
    "however , for a fixed value of @xmath0 , the quantities @xmath232 and @xmath233 , for example , are linear combinations of @xmath231 and are also observables . from such families of observables ,",
    "parametrized by @xmath0 , we can obviously construct functions such as @xmath232 which an internal observer might construe as representing the evolution with time of a single observable @xmath19 belonging to his 0-dimensional `` space '' .",
    "this assumes that the internal observer , who does not appear explicitly in our model , does not significantly disturb the objects represented by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if suitably equipped , he will be able to inspect two independent objects , an oscillator and a `` free particle '' , associated respectively with the pairs of phase - space coordinates @xmath147 and @xmath234 .    in the case of a time - reparametrizarion - invariant system , the families @xmath232 and @xmath233 have no gauge - invariant meaning , since they depend on @xmath0 through the undetermined lapse function @xmath235 .",
    "the gauge - invariant quantities which might qualify as observables are necessarily global quantities , in the sense that they can not be associated with any particular value of @xmath0 , and can not evolve with time in any straightforward sense .",
    "for example , the gauge - invariant variables @xmath30 and @xmath67 in ( [ gensoln5 ] ) and ( [ gensoln6 ] ) specify the amplitude of the @xmath19 oscillation and the phase of this oscillation corresponding to @xmath236 .",
    "one way out of this difficulty is to suppose that a specific lapse function is spontaneously selected , so that gauge invariance is broken , and gauge - variant quantities such as @xmath232 become physically meaningful . in general , this strategy seems unsound , since no physical principle gives rise to a preferred function @xmath12 . in effect , the reparametrization invariance is removed artificially , and the constraint obtained by varying @xmath12 is then poorly justified .",
    "we note , however , that recent attempts to adapt the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics to quantum gravity do appear to produce a preferred foliation of spacetime and hence a natural definition of time evolution .",
    "it is tempting to account for time evolution in the following way . consider the reparametrization - invariant model consisting just of a single oscillator ( the model ( [ clocklagrangian ] ) with @xmath20 omitted ) .",
    "the solution to its equation of motion is of the form @xmath237 the amplitude @xmath105 is constrained to have the value @xmath238 , so there are no gauge - invariant variables , and the @xmath11-dimensional system has just one state available to it .",
    "nevertheless , it seems intuitively clear that an observer inside the @xmath11-dimensional universe would perceive an oscillation of the form @xmath239 , where @xmath9 is the proper time along this observer s world line .",
    "moreover , this assertion seems to be gauge - independent , since the lapse function serves only to relate @xmath9 to an arbitrary coordinate @xmath0 , which is irrelevant to the observer .",
    "indeed , it is essentially this line of argument which enables an account to be given in elementary applications of general relativity of the time - dependent appearance of the universe to an observer .",
    "the discrepancy between the time evolution perceived by an internal observer and the single state apparent to an external observer arises from the fact that our model includes no description of the clock from which the internal observer gains his sense of time .    to reconstruct what an internal observer s experience might be",
    ", it seems plausible that we must incorporate in our model at least a rudimentary description of this observer s clock .",
    "classically , the variable @xmath20 , whose behaviour is exhibited in ( [ gensoln6 ] ) mimics an instrument whose reading is linear in the geometrical proper time @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 defined in ( [ xoftau ] ) defines a family of gauge - invariant observables which can be construed as giving the value of @xmath19 which would be perceived by an internal observer when a proper time @xmath9 has elapsed since his clock read zero .",
    "moreover , the evolution of @xmath8 with @xmath9 is governed by an equation of motion ( [ dxdtau ] ) of the standard hamiltonian form .",
    "quantum - mechanically , this equation of motion translates to a heisenberg equation ( [ heisenberg ] ) , again of the standard form .",
    "it thus seems consistent with the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics to suppose that an external observer might determine the state of the `` universe '' by measuring the value of @xmath151 , say with the result @xmath6 .",
    "one can then compute the probability @xmath240 that a measurement of @xmath152 will yield the value @xmath4 .",
    "this probability may plausibly be interpreted as the probability that an internal observer , having determined the position of the oscillator as @xmath6 will obtain the value @xmath4 from a measurement made after an interval @xmath241 of his proper time .    to this extent , we recover precisely the usual formulation of time - dependent quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the status of the clock variable in this formulation requires further thought .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 , we can construct from ( [ gensoln6 ] ) the family of gauge - invariant variables @xmath242 , where @xmath243 .",
    "classically , the values of @xmath8 and @xmath244 can be determined simultaneously , and it might appear that these values represent the results of inspecting both the oscillator and the clock at time @xmath9 .",
    "however , in contrast to the non - reparametrization - invariant system , the physical reduced phase space is now 2-dimensional .",
    "the two coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath74 are just sufficient to represent the position and momentum of the oscillator , and there are no further coordinates available to represent the clock as an independent dynamical object . as emphasised , for example , by unruh @xcite , who has also considered the two - oscillator model , the variables @xmath245 and @xmath246 , in ( [ gensoln7 ] ) and ( [ gensoln8 ] ) , which one would ordinarily want to treat as schrdinger picture operators representing the oscillator and clock positions , do not correspond to operators on the physical hilbert space . indeed , the variable @xmath8 in ( [ xoftau])can be defined only when we solve the constraint , eliminating @xmath20 as an independent dynamical variable . correspondingly , the evolution of @xmath244 can not be obtained from a hamiltonian equation of motion , since @xmath247 commutes with @xmath148 ( equation ( [ h_0 ] ) ) .",
    "quantum - mechanically , @xmath8 and @xmath244 do not commute , so their values can not be determined simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the hilbert space of this model is finite - dimensional , so the readings of any object we wish to regard as a clock must be drawn from a finite , discrete set of eigenvalues . from these considerations ,",
    "it is apparent that a statement such as @xmath248 can not be taken as implying that both the oscillator and the clock have been inspected , yielding the value @xmath6 for the position of the oscillator and the value @xmath149 for the time .",
    "thus , @xmath9 can not be regarded as a phenomenological time deduced by an observer from his inspection of a physical clock which reads @xmath20 .",
    "rather , the definition of @xmath8 reflects a decision on the part of an external observer ( or of a theoretician ) to study time evolution from a particular point of view .",
    "one might , for example , imagine an automatic observing apparatus , which performs a sequence of tasks under the control of an internal clock , @xmath20 . to study time evolution `` from the point of view '' of this apparatus , it is natural to solve the hamiltonian constraint by eliminating the unobserved quantity @xmath20 , in order to arrive at the time - dependent observable @xmath8 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath9 represents a `` heraclitian '' time of the kind sought by unruh and wald , which `` sets the conditions '' for a measurement to be made . like the parameter @xmath0 in a non - reparametrization - invariant system ,",
    "@xmath9 itself is not a measurable quantity .",
    "furthermore , it appears quite unnecessary for the eliminated variable to be linear , or even monotonic , in @xmath9 .",
    "the physical hilbert space associated with the model ( [ clocklagrangian2 ] ) and the algebra of the gauge - invariant operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 obtained by eliminating @xmath20 is independent of the parameter @xmath82 which determines the frequency of the @xmath20 oscillator .",
    "the role of the clock @xmath20 in passing from either ( [ gensoln5 ] ) and ( [ gensoln6 ] ) or ( [ gensoln9 ] ) and ( [ gensoln10 ] ) to the gauge - invariant observable ( [ xoftau ] ) is that it distinguishes a history in which , for example , @xmath249 when @xmath236 from one in which some other value of @xmath20 corresponds to this value of @xmath19 .",
    "in essence , the definition of a gauge - invariant observable @xmath8 becomes possible when an origin @xmath76 can be specified in a coordinate - independent manner , and the role of @xmath20 is to provide this origin .",
    "the view of time evolution described here is similar , though not identical , to that proposed by rovelli @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", rovelli considers essentially the model ( [ clocklagrangian2 ] ) with @xmath250 .",
    "he defines a gauge - invariant classical observable given , in our notation , by @xmath251\\ ,                           \\label{rovellisx}\\ ] ] which is the value of @xmath19 when @xmath252 . like our @xmath9",
    ", the clock time @xmath253 can assume a continuous range of real values .",
    "( note also that , like our @xmath8 , this @xmath254 is gauge - variant at @xmath48 , since it depends on @xmath67 , though in fact only @xmath255 is well - defined . )",
    "the qualitative discussion given in @xcite suggests that rovelli wishes to regard @xmath254 as representing the evolution of @xmath19 relative to the time recorded by a physical clock . for the reasons given above , however , it is not possible to regard @xmath253 and @xmath254 as the two results of inspecting a clock and an oscillator simultaneously .",
    "the operator corresponding to ( [ rovellisx ] ) is approximately self - adjoint , and obeys an approximate heisenberg equation of motion , only when restricted to a region of the physical hilbert space which rovelli calls the `` schrdinger regime '' , corresponding roughly to states in which the wavefunction @xmath256 is sharply peaked around the classical trajectory .",
    "for this reason , rovelli contends that the notion of time does not exist at a fundamental level , but emerges only in a suitable semiclassical limit .",
    "by contrast , our operator @xmath8 is exactly self - adjoint , and obeys the exact heisenberg equation ( [ heisenberg ] ) , with respect to the variable @xmath9 which classically corresponds to the geometrical proper time , and this provides a counterexample to rovelli s contention .",
    "we would like , of course , to speculate that the view of time evolution proposed here can be extended to canonically quantized general relativity .",
    "in such an extension , it seems likely that the role of @xmath9 would be played by the proper time along the trajectory of an observer for whose observations we wish to account , while @xmath8 would correspond to local observables defined on this trajectory .",
    "to define , say , time - dependent observables throughout a space - like hypersurface , one would presumably need to introduce a space - filling family of observers ( or , at least , their clocks ) .",
    "these might correspond to a reference fluid of the kind described by brown and kucha , though the relationship of our interpretation to that proposed by these authors is not entirely clear to us .",
