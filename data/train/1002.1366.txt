    "the successful demonstration of , for instance , the mapping of the coherent state of a traveling qubit ( a photon ) to the atomic state memory qubit @xcite as well as single photon generation @xcite are recent examples of significant progress in controlling the interaction of a single atom with the cavity field . for the creation of two - particle entangled states , promising proposals rely on either applying deterministic protocols",

    "not only for the application in quantum information science , but also more generally for the investigation of strongly interacting atom - cavity systems it is vital to understand the spin dynamics of one and especially more than one atom simultaneously coupled to the resonator field . in the work presented here we concentrate on the case of one and two atoms and",

    "the virtue of the bayesian method is evident in analyzing the corresponding telegraph signals , for which the atomic state can not be unambiguously deduced from the measured transmission signal because of technical limitations on the signal - to - noise ratio .    in our measurements",
    "we observe fluctuations in the transmission exceeding shot noise , which we attribute to thermal motion of the atom .",
    "we discuss the impact of this external dynamics on the performance of the bayesian analysis .",
    "at the beginning of every experimental sequence , a controlled number of cesium ( cs ) atoms is transferred from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) into a standing wave far - off - resonant dipole trap ( fort ) with @xmath0 nm and a trap depth of @xmath1 mk .",
    "this trap acts as an `` optical conveyor belt '' @xcite to transport atoms into the optical resonator .",

    "the transmission of a weak probe laser through the cavity is detected with a single - photon counting module ( spcm ) . using a custom - build time - to - digital converter , we record - for each photon click - the time since the last click , where for our typical count - rates dead time effects are negligible .",
    "this list of click - intervals is then converted into a binned transmission signal by counting the detector clicks in each bin time interval @xmath5 .        the total detection efficiency for the probe laser light , including absorption and scattering by the mirror coatings , losses at various optical elements along the optical path , and the quantum efficiency of the detector , amounts to @xmath6 , which is a threefold improvement compared to our earlier work presented in @xcite .",
    "the main challenge was to optimize the separation of probe- and stabilization - laser , with typical powers of a few @xmath7 and @xmath8 watts , respectively . in a first step , they are separated by their carefully adjusted orthogonal polarizations . improved spectral filtering was achieved by replacing a standard ruled diffraction grating with a volume holographic grating , allowing us to omit an additional interference filter used before , while still achieving a total suppression of the stabilization laser to better than @xmath9 .",
    "the probe laser frequency is set close to the transition of the cs @xmath10 line , where @xmath11 is the total angular momentum quantum number . for this transition ,",
    "the important parameters of the atom - cavity system are @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the nominal coupling strength for an atom at the position of maximum coupling , @xmath14 is the cavity field decay rate , and @xmath15 is the atomic dipole decay rate .",
    "since in our setup the birefringent splitting of the cavity resonances is larger than the cavity linewidth , the cavity field is always linearly polarized , causing a distribution of the atomic population over all zeeman sublevels due to photon scattering by the probe laser .",
    "thus the coupling strength @xmath13 given above is obtained from a weighted average over all couplings @xmath16 , based on the steady state @xmath17 distribution for linearly polarized optical pumping @xcite . with the single - atom cooperativity parameter @xmath18 ,",
    "our system is in the strong coupling regime , where already a single atom significantly influences the cavity spectrum .      in our system",
    "the two long - lived hyperfine groundstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 serve as qubit states @xcite . for the coupled atom - cavity system we measure this state by tuning the cavity close to the @xmath21 transition , where only an atom in the @xmath20 state leads to a drop in the transmission , while an atom in @xmath19 is so far detuned ( around 9.2 ghz ) that it effectively decouples from the system and does not influence the cavity transmission , see fig .",

    "the probe laser with angular frequency @xmath23 is initially tuned to the resonance frequency of the empty cavity @xmath24 , so when an atom in @xmath20 is inserted into the cavity the transmission is reduced to a level which depends on the detuning @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the angular frequency of the atomic @xmath21 transition , including the ac - stark shift induced by the fort potential . to experimentally distinguish between an atom in @xmath19 and an atom lost from the trap ,",
    "which both result in the same transmission signal , a repumping laser resonant with the @xmath27 transition can be applied from the side which brings the atom in @xmath19 back to the @xmath21 cycle .",
    "thus for an empty cavity the transmission would remain unchanged , while for an atom still present in the cavity the transmission would drop again .",
    "if the state detection technique described above gave the same result for an unlimited series of state measurements , it would be a perfect projective quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite , assuming the system is otherwise unperturbed .",
    "however , in our situation the same laser that we use to detect the atomic state ( the probe laser ) can change it via inelastic hyperfine - state - changing raman scattering .",
    "an atom in the @xmath20 groundstate can thus be transferred to @xmath19 via the @xmath28 and @xmath29 excited states , thereby undergoing a _ quantum jump _ @xcite .      to experimentally determine the rate @xmath30 of probe - laser - induced transitions from @xmath20 to @xmath19 and to identify optimum experimental conditions , we performed the following measurement : an atom , optically pumped into @xmath20 , is transported into the cavity center , causing a drop of the cavity transmission , see fig .",
    "[ reick - fig03 ] ( a ) .",
    "since no repumper is applied , probe - laser scattering causes a spontaneous transition to @xmath19 after some time , visible as an instantaneous rise in transmission back to the empty cavity level . to check whether the rise in transmission is really due to a quantum jump and not caused by atom loss ,",
    "the repumper is switched on at the end of the sequence as discussed above .",
    "is obtained from the exponential fit .",
    "the averaged transmission level at the end of the sequence , when the repumper is switched on , is higher than the initial drop , indicating a lower average coupling strength .",

    "this average dwell time was measured for a wide range of detunings @xmath32 . for the same settings , but with the repumper constantly applied , we measured the transmission level @xmath33 , defined as the photon count rate with one atom in @xmath20 coupled to the cavity , normalized to the empty cavity signal .",

    "[ reick - fig04 ] ( b ) , @xmath30 is calculated as a function of detuning using the kramers - heisenberg - formula @xcite . for this calculation , one has to treat the distribution over all zeeman sublevels and thermal motion separately , since this situation can not be modeled as a two - level system with an effective coupling .",
    "the measured data agree satisfactorily with the theoretical model , confirming that the best approximation to a projective qnd - measurement with longest dwell times is close to resonance .",
    "a practical limitation is that stable coupling was never observed for detunings @xmath39 30 mhz , probably due to cavity cooling becoming less effective @xcite .      in the experiments discussed so far ,",
    "the repumping laser was either switched off or its intensity was adjusted such that an atom off - resonantly transferred to @xmath19 was pumped back to @xmath20 immediately , compared to all relevant time scales in our experiment . in contrast , for the measurements presented in the following , we deliberately attenuated the continuously applied repumping laser to a level at which the transfer rate @xmath40 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 was comparable to @xmath30 . therefore , the resulting quantum jumps occur in both directions on a similar timescale of several milliseconds and are thus detectable as a random telegraph signal , see fig .",

    "we quantify our knowledge about the atom s hyperfine spin by probabilities assigned to the different atomic states . for the following discussion",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath41 to denote the number of atoms in @xmath20 . in this section @xmath41",
    "attains only the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whereas the case of two atoms ( see section [ sec : twoatoms ] ) also permits the value @xmath44 .",
    "internal state changes of a single atom are transitions between the two states @xmath45 , and they occur with the rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are identical to @xmath30 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "although we imagine the transitions to occur randomly and at discrete instances of time , the probabilities for the atom to occupy the different states change in a continuous manner governed by the following rate equations : @xmath48 the average steady - state probabilities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are obtained by setting @xmath51 and using @xmath52 .",
    "the solutions are thus given by the ratio between the transition rates : @xmath53 the average probabilities and thus the ratio of the rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 can therefore be obtained from photon count histograms by the following procedure : along with the telegraph signals , transmission traces for an empty cavity ( @xmath54 ) , and for one continuously coupled atom ( @xmath55 ) were measured for otherwise identical settings . from these three sets of data , normalized photon count histograms @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are computed , with @xmath59 being the number of photons detected per binning time @xmath60 ms . here and for the remaining discussion , @xmath61 always refers to photon - count probabilities , while @xmath62 indicates spin - state probabilities .",
    "since the telegraph signal is expected to represent the atomic system jumping between the different states , the associated accumulated histogram of photon counts should be a weighted fit @xmath63 of the independently measured histograms @xmath64 for the two atomic states . treating @xmath65 as a fitting parameter yields @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    in order to extract the transition rates",
    ", we note that the jumping of the atom between two different states with different transmission properties causes characteristic fluctuations in the number of detection events obtained in different time bins , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which become visible in the second - order correlation function @xmath70 . assuming poissonian count distributions , an analysis of the rate equations yields @xcite @xmath71 the histogram of the telegraph signal and the @xmath72 function are plotted in figure [ reick - fig06 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . from an exponential fit of the correlation function , we get @xmath73 , therefore we obtain @xmath74 and @xmath75 using @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and eqs .",

    "the blue dashed line is an exponential fit yielding the time constant @xmath76 ms . ]    in the discussion above , we assumed that the state of the atom can be described by the two states @xmath77 and @xmath55 alone , each leading to a poissonian distribution @xmath64 of the photon count rate . for @xmath77",
    "this is verified by the measurement : the right peak of the measured histogram in figure [ reick - fig06 ] ( a ) agrees with a poissonian distribution of the the same average count rate .",
    "thus the state detection for @xmath77 , with the transmission being equal to the empty - cavity case , is essentially shot - noise limited and residual frequency or intensity fluctuations of the probe - laser can be neglected .    however , comparing the photon count histogram @xmath58 with the poissonian distribution ( left peak of the histogram in fig .",
    "[ reick - fig06 ] ( a ) ) indicates super - poissonian fluctuations .",
    "we attribute these mainly to thermal motion of the atom : the coupling constant @xmath13 follows the cavity mode function , i.e. , which in turn leads to a transmission level @xmath78 , depending on the atomic position , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tforzerodeltapc ] ) .    in later sections of this paper",
    "we shall discuss candidates for a more complete theoretical analysis of this dynamics . at this point",
    ", we pursue a pragmatic approach and still extract the atomic transition rates from the correlation function as stated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2rates ] ) , because this relation does not rely strongly on the poissonian character of the signal .",
    "furthermore , the exact values of the rates are not the main result of this work and do not convey fundamental physical insight , since they are determined by the intensities of the probe and repumping laser .",
    "they rather constitute parameters in the following statistical analysis .",
    "to quantify the knowledge about the atomic state that we obtain from the measured telegraph signals , we use a bayesian approach in analyzing the data .",
    "the philosophy behind this approach is that we assign probabilities to the possible states @xmath45 of the atom , and acknowledge that these probabilities merely reflect our incomplete knowledge about the system , unless one of the probabilities is unity . due to the atomic transitions which occur without our direct noticing , the probabilities of the unobserved system obey the rate equations ( [ eq : singleatomrea ] ) and ( [ eq : singleatomreb ] ) , but since the cavity transmission depends on the atomic state , we learn about the atomic state from the observed photon count record .",
    "the probabilities @xmath79 are thus calculated step - wise from the incremental information obtained in every time bin of the measured telegraph signal .",
    "let @xmath80 be the number of photons detected during the interval @xmath81 $ ] , where the binning time @xmath82 is fixed to 1ms for the following analysis .",
    "with @xmath83 we refer to the probability for an atom to be in the state @xmath41 in the midpoint of the aforementioned interval . assuming that the atomic state probabilities in the previous time bin @xmath84 are known , the probabilities @xmath83 are estimated by first evolving their values according to the rate equations ( [ eq : singleatomrea ] ) and ( [ eq : singleatomreb ] ) . in a linear approximation for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , this leads to @xmath87 where @xmath88 indicates the unconditional probability .",
    "note that the probabilistic description does not imply that the atom occupies two different states , but only that we do not know which one is actually occupied .",
    "this also implies that our prediction for the distribution of photon numbers @xmath80 detected in the @xmath89-th time bin has to be calculated as a weighted average @xmath90 .",
    "the actually measured photon counts @xmath80 provide new information , and the state probabilities are updated using bayes rule of conditional probabilities : @xmath91 the conditional probabilities @xmath92 are extracted from the separately measured photon count histograms for @xmath93 0 and 1 , respectively . setting the initial probabilities to @xmath94 , @xmath95 , because the atom is prepared in @xmath20 before being transported into the cavity , @xmath83 is then updated stepwise for each time bin . in this way ,",
    "the time - dependent atomic state probabilities are computed successively for the whole transmission trace .",
    "figure [ reick - fig05 ] ( a ) shows an example trace of a telegraph signal to which the bayesian algorithm was applied . most of the time , the probability @xmath96 , plotted in ( b ) , is close to either 0 or 1 , while narrow spikes indicate short periods of time with less complete knowledge about @xmath79 .",
    "the bayes analysis provides more definite probabilities than a matching of the currently transmitted signal to the state dependent transmission rate , because it updates previously estimated results and thus accumulates statistical significance over time .",
    "the optical probing of the system does not , however , prevent atomic transitions from taking place , and during such transitions , the bayes algorithm faithfully reproduces our inability to determine the state of the atom with certainty until a significant amount of data has been accumulated which is in agreement with the new state of the atom . in this context , the narrow spikes in the figure illustrate the  willingness \" of the bayesian update to interpret a few unexpected photon counts as the emerging signal of a change of state , while they may be only statistical fluctuations . for photon count histograms with negligible overlap",
    ", the bayesian algorithm would yield the same result as a simple threshold analysis .",
    "its main advantage is that one can still extract information about the spin dynamics even for a signal where the signal - to - noise ratio prohibits a threshold analysis , as will become apparent in the next section .",
    "so far we have presented experiments revealing the internal spin dynamics of one atom coupled to the cavity mode .",
    "placing two atoms into the resonator leads to an effective interaction between them , mediated by the cavity field @xcite , and detecting the number of atoms being in a particular state could be used for entanglement generation in cavity - qed - systems @xcite .      in the previous section",

    "improved values of the three transition rates are now determined by the following iterative , self - consistent method :    an analytical solution of the rate equations for @xmath96 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with the initial conditions given above , yields the ensemble - averaged probabilities @xmath139 with the three jump rates as parameters .",
    "averaging over the probabilities @xmath62 obtained from the analysis of many traces provides an _ experimental _ result for @xmath140 , which can be fitted with the analytical solution , in which the rates @xmath46 , @xmath133 and @xmath130 are used as fit parameters . with the new values for the rates obtained in this way , the bayes algorithm",
    "is applied over again to all experimental traces , yielding an updated set of time dependent probabilities @xmath62 , which is again averaged to extract the rates , etc .",
    "the converged set of rates obtained from this analysis is @xmath141 and the final results for @xmath62 for the example trace are shown in fig .",
    "[ reick - fig09 ] ( b ) .",
    "the ratio between @xmath46 and @xmath133 obtained from this iterative process does not confirm the assumption of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateratio ] ) , because with @xmath142 , we would expect @xmath143 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear at this stage .",
    "in this section we will address some questions arising in connection with the statistical analysis presented in the manuscript .",
    "first , we will discuss the dependence of the bayesian atomic state analysis on the measurement data binning time , which presents interesting questions both in the case of posissonian and non - poissonian counting statistics .",
    "secondly , we will discuss the possible origin of the non - poissonian character of the photon count records and its consequences for our extraction of rate parameters and the bayesian analysis .      in the analysis of the one and two atom telegraph signals discussed so far , we used binning times of 1 ms . let us recall that the raw - data of the cavity transmission consists of a list of time intervals between photon clicks , see fig .",
    "[ reick - fig11 ] ( b ) for an example trace . to study some of the consequences which a change in time bin size might have",
    ", we analyzed one and the same set of data using the bayes formalism , but for different bin sizes .",
    "if long time bins are used , the signal to noise ratio in each bin is good , and the count histograms for each atomic state become well separated .",
    "this implies that for long sequences of time , the atomic state probabilities will be firmly fixed to values close to zero and unity , while the instances where transitions between the states occur are not resolved within the duration of a single time bin .",
    "but this is only true as long as @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , because for even longer times transitions will occur within a significant fraction of the bins causing considerable uncertainty about the actual atomic state .",
    "going to shorter time bins , the signal - to - noise ratio is decreased , and the overlap of the photon count histograms become larger .",
    "correspondingly , it happens more frequently that a less probable , but still possible , number of counts in a time bin causes a narrow spike in the atomic state probabilities derived from the bayes conditional update rule , where indeed no transition took place .",
    "this behavior is evident from the spikes in fig [ reick - fig12 ] .",
    "one would suspect that the additional information provided by subdividing data into counts registered in the first and second half of every time bin would only serve to yield a better estimate of the atomic state , since no knowledge is lost by this finer binning of the data . in the case where no transitions occur and we aim to detect the state initially occupied by the atom in a quantum nondemolition manner ,",
    "the bayesian analysis indeed becomes independent of data binning size for a poissonian count process . to study this issue in our system , with the state - changing rate process occurring simultaneously with the probing",
    ", we evaluated the one - atom telegraph signals for different bin sizes using the bayesian algorithm , see fig .",
    "[ reick - fig12 ] . even for @xmath146 10 s , when there is no click in 80% of all bins , the calculated probability @xmath96 is often close to 0 or 1 , although the state probability shows more short spikes compared to @xmath147 1 ms .    to give a single quantitative measure of our uncertainty about the atomic state",
    ", we calculate the entropy @xmath148 where the average @xmath149 is performed over the whole duration of all analyzed traces .",
    "the entropy is plotted in fig .",
    "[ reick - fig13 ] for a range of bin times from 10 s to 20 ms .",
    "the sharp rise of @xmath150 for large bins is due to the high probability in every time bin for an atomic transition to occur .",
    "we ascribe the increase of @xmath150 towards shorter bins to the occurrence of more spikes in @xmath62 , already visible in fig .",
    "[ reick - fig12 ] ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "according to the entropy measure , there seems to be an optimum time bin , which is related to the magnitude of the quantum jump rates .",
    "we recall , however , that the entropy ( [ eq : entropy ] ) is only one of many possible measures of the information extracted from the system .",
    "if , for example , the measurements constitute a component in a feedback mechanism , access to data on the shortest time scale may yield the better performance with respect to the desired goal of the feedback protocol .     as a function of binning time @xmath82 . ]      the existence of an optimum bin time , leading to a minimum in the time averaged entropy ( [ eq : entropy ] ) , is observed both for our experimental histogram data and in simulations with poissonian counting statistics associated with each atomic state .",
    "the case of super - poissonian counting distributions , i.e. , distributions with a variance exceeding the mean value of the number of counts , however , presents it own separate problems , and points to more elaborate future methods of analysis .",
    "we already commented on the apparent extra fluctuations in the light transmission signal being possibly correlated with the atomic motion between sites exhibiting different coupling strengths to the cavity mode , corresponding to different transmission levels .",
    "this suggests an extended model , where the state with no atoms coupled to the field ( @xmath77 ) is retained as a single state , while states with @xmath151 are split according to an extra position label , attaining a number of different values . if for example a single atom can reside in two locations leading to two different poissonian transmission signals , the long time averaged photon count distribution will be a weighted sum of these distributions , while the count number correlation function within an experimental trace may reveal the transition rates between the atomic locations , equivalent to our analysis of internal state transitions in sec . [ subsec : oneatombayes ]",
    "this is an appealing and very likely explanation of the broadened histograms , and it points to an interesting problem for our previous analysis .    if the super - poissonian fluctuations in our counting histograms are caused by atomic motion between states with different poissonian signals , counts in close lying time bins , where atoms have not yet moved , should be correlated .",
    "this implies that the bayesian update is no longer a markov process , where the updated probabilities depend only on the most recent value and the latest measurement result , but also knowledge of previous counts should be applied to extract maximum information about the atomic state .",
    "this effect may have significant consequences for very short time bins , where each bin offers a low signal - to - noise ratio , but where correlations between bins may be strong .",
    "we have analyzed our experimental records , and we indeed find such correlations , but because of limited statistics these findings could not be incorporated quantitatively into our analysis .",
    "this does not imply that our previous use of the bayes update formalism produces erroneous results , but it should be noted that it represents the update based on a restricted access to ( or memory of ) the measurement data , and hence it provides a non - optimal estimate of the atomic state based on incomplete information .",
    "we have shown that a bayesian analysis of experimental transmission signals from a cavity containing one or two atoms provides a high degree of certainty about the atomic state .",
    "we have demonstrated how rates of the atomic processes can be fitted to the data , and we have discussed possible physical explanations of noise in the data beyond the predictions of simple models .",
    "a natural next step would be to use a more complete model , including the larger number of position states and internal states of the atoms .",
    "we recall that already for the simplest model with only internal state dynamics , finding the parameters is not a trivial task , but ad hoc iterative procedures have allowed the identification of consistent sets of parameters used in our present analysis in this paper .",
    "it will put stringent demands on the reproducibility of large data sets to make a reliable fit to more advanced models , but we wish to conclude this paper with a brief mentioning of a promising systematic theoretical data analysis that can be applied to such data in a future more elaborate treatment : the hidden markov model ( hmm ) @xcite .",
    "we indicated that there is a possible physical mechanism responsible for the fluctuations and for the temporal correlations between count signals . in this way we point at an underlying markovian model , where the atoms perform transitions between different internal and position states , and for each of these states , the coherent light field is transmitted with a definite transmission coefficient , and counting statistics are poissonian with no temporal correlations .",
    "this is , indeed , a physical realization of a hidden markov process in statistical modelling of time series , with applications in insurance , finance , speech recognition , image analysis and many other fields , where a single series of data is mathematically modeled as the outcome of a system undergoing transitions between ( hidden ) states , each giving different data characteristics . in their most advanced forms ,",
    "hmms only assume the transitions between the hidden states to be markovian , i.e. , the state populations follow a transfer matrix of discrete or continuous population changes , while the signal can have any state dependent probability distribution .",
    "our problem belongs to a narrower class with continuous rate equations ( with unknown rates ) , and it is plausible to assume poissonian count statistics parameterized by a single parameter for each atomic state .",
    "this case is treated , e.g. , in @xcite , and the problem of estimating the transition rates among a family of @xmath152 states and the @xmath152 photon transmission rates from the data is solved by an iterative variational application of the maximum likelihood principle . in a genuine hmm , the number of states @xmath152 is not known , and one merely attempts to fit the data with different candidate numbers of states . for an application to our problem ,",
    "we are guided by the physics , and after a successful fit , we would request that the states identified should have the properties corresponding to a few position states for each of the internal state @xmath151 cases .",
    "i.e. , they should occur in groups with similar photon scattering rates , and certain transition rates should be very small or vanish .",
    "in addition to an extended model for the analysis , we aim at improving the experimental conditions , such that the super - poissonian noise is less pronounced . since we attribute these fluctuations mainly to thermal motion of the atom , increasing the stability of the coupling strength",
    "requires a tighter confinement of the atom .",
    "this could be achieved by employing cavity - mediated cooling forces @xcite , raman cooling @xcite or additional trapping potentials .",
    "the rate at which information about the atom - cavity system can be acquired is ultimately limited by the photon flux arriving at the detector .",
    "the most important obstacles for further enhancement of the detection efficiency are losses from the cavity - mirror coatings and the limited quantum efficiency of the spcm . employing homodyne or",
    "heterodyne detection would permit the use of detectors with a quantum efficiency close to 100% .",
    "the former problem could be solved by using a more open cavity configuration , where the transmission coefficient is significantly larger than the losses .",
    "advancements both in terms of experimental conditions and statistical analysis could finally lead to the development and implementation of quantum feedback techniques for the preparation , stabilization and error correction of non - classical quantum states @xcite .",
