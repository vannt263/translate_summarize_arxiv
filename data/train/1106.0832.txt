    "the problem of pattern formation is one of the most rapidly developing branches of nonlinear science today @xcite .",
    "the 2d laplacian growth equation describes a wide range of physical problems , for example , filtration combustion in a porous medium , displacement of a cold liquid in a hele - shaw channel by the same liquid that is heated or of a hot gas in a hele - shaw channel by the same gas that is cooled , and solidification of a solid penetrating a liquid in a channel @xcite .",
    "this equation has an elegant analytical solution in the form of poles .",
    "however , such an equation can lead to the appearance of final time singularities . to prevent these singularities and to regularise the problem , a term containing the surface tension is usually introduced into the equation describing laplacian growth .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of such a surface tension term , obtaining an analytical solution in the form of poles becomes impossible .",
    "in addition , it is usually assumed that the surface tension explains the occurrence of an asymptotic solution in the form of a finger with half of the channel width .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour is also observed in experiments . in this paper , the mathematical mechanism of the regularisation",
    "is introduced .",
    "it makes it possible to avoid final time singularities , results in desirable asymptotic behaviour in the form of a finger with half of the channel width , and maintains the analytical solution in the form of poles .",
    "maintenance of the analytical character of the solution is very important - it makes it possible to easily analyse 2d laplacian growth solutions and to qualitatively or quantitatively explain the behaviour .",
    "the author sincerely hopes that this paper will play the same role for the 2d laplacian growth equation as the paper @xcite did for the theory of gaseous combustion of pre - mixed flames .",
    "the @xcite analytical solution and its asymptotic behaviour have given a push to development of the theory of gaseous combustion of pre - mixed flames and have made it possible to qualitatively or quantitatively explain the behaviour of a front of pre - mixed flames @xcite .",
    "matkowsky , in collaboration with dr .",
    "aldushin , considered planar , uniformly propagating combustion waves driven by the filtration of gas containing an oxidiser , which reacts with the combustible porous medium through which it moves @xcite .",
    "these waves were typically found to be unstable with respect to hydrodynamic perturbations for both forward ( coflow ) and reverse ( counterflow ) filtration combustion ( fc ) , in which the direction of gas flow is the same as or opposite to the direction of propagation of the combustion wave , respectively .",
    "the basic mechanism leading to instability is the reduction of the resistance to flow in the region of the combustion products due to an increase of the porosity in that region .",
    "another destabilising effect in forward fc is the production of gaseous products in the reaction . in reverse fc ,",
    "this effect is stabilising . in the case",
    "in which the planar front is unstable , an alternative mode of propagation in the form of a finger propagating with constant velocity was proposed .",
    "the finger region occupied by the combustion products is separated from the unburned region by a front in which chemical reactions and heat and mass transport occur .    in the papers @xcite of prof .",
    "matkowsky and dr .",
    "aldushin , it was shown that the finger solution of the combustion problem can be characterised as a solution of a saffman - taylor ( st ) problem originally formulated to describe the displacement of one fluid by another having a smaller viscosity in a porous medium or in a hele - shaw configuration .",
    "the st problem is known to possess a family of finger solutions , with each member characterised by its own velocity and each occupying a different fraction of the porous channel through which it propagates .",
    "the scalar field governing the evolution of the interface is a harmonic function .",
    "it is natural , then , to call the whole process @xmath1 @xmath2 .    the mathematical problem of laplacian growth without surface tension",
    "exhibits a family of exact analytical solutions in terms of logarithmic poles in the complex plane .",
    "the main problem with such a solution is existing finite time singularities . to prevent such singularities , nonzero surface tension usually is used ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface tension also results in a well - defined asymptotic solution : only one finger with half of the channel width .",
    "in addition , the other terms can be used for regularisation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the solution of the st problem without surface tension is similar to the solution for the equation describing cellular flames in the case of combustion of gas mixtures @xcite .",
    "indeed , in both cases , solutions can be transformed to the set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this set describes the motion of poles in the complex plane .",
    "applying nonzero surface tension to the st problem destroys this elegant analytical solution .",
    "it must be mentioned that the filtration combustion and the gaseous combustion in pre - mixed flames are features of different physics ; the equation of 2d laplacian growth and the equation describing the mihelson - sivashinsky feature use completely different mathematics . moreover , whereas the equation for the mihelson - sivashinsky poles involves trigonometric functions , the equation for the 2d laplacian growth poles involves logarithmic functions .",
    "the analogy here is not `` half - baked '' but rather is deep .",
    "indeed , the very different and complex integro - differential equations have a simple analytical solution in the form of poles .",
    "moreover , even the behaviour of these poles is similar .",
    "another problem is the fact that surface tension may not be introduced for the mathematical problem considered by saffman and taylor involving filtration combustion in a porous medium @xcite . here , the zone of chemical reaction and diffusion of heat and mass shrinks to an interface separating the burned region from the unburned region . in all these problems , there is no pressure jump at the interface , so surface tension may not be introduced .",
    "thus , the saffman - taylor model arises not only as the limiting case of zero surface tension in a problem in which surface tension enters the problem in a natural way but also in other situations in which the introduction of surface tension makes no sense .",
    "another such problem is that of the solidification of a solid penetrating a liquid in a channel .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the selection may be affected by introducing a perturbation other than surface tension that is relevant to the specific problem under consideration .",
    "for example , in the combustion problem , the effect of diffusion as a perturbation might be considered . here",
    ", the effect of diffusion is similar to that of surface tension in the fluid displacement problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to look for a solution without introducing surface tension using different methods for regularisation .    criteria were proposed ( @xcite and @xcite ) to select the correct member of the family of solutions ( one finger with half of the channel width ) based on a consideration of the st problem itself , rather than on modifications of the problem .",
    "a modification is obtained by adding surface tension to the model and then taking the limit of the vanishing surface tension .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear from the papers _ why _ laplacian growth without surface tension gives this asymptotic solution ( one finger with half of the channel width ) that satisfies the identified criteria .",
    "however , a more direct way exists to solve the problem .",
    "first of all , we can introduce a small amount of noise to the system .",
    "( the noise can be considered a pole flux from infinity . )",
    "second , for regularisation of the problem , we throw out all new poles that can produce a finite time singularity .",
    "it can be strictly proved that the asymptotic solution for such a system is a single finger . moreover ,",
    "the qualitative consideration demonstrates that a finger with @xmath0 of the channel width is statistically stable .",
    "therefore , all properties of such a solution are exactly the same as for the solution with a nonzero surface tension under numerical noise .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin by presenting arguments about saffman - taylor `` finger '' formation with half of the channel size ( section  [ sec : method0 ] ) .",
    "next , section  [ sec : method1 ] describes asymptotic single saffman - taylor `` finger '' formation without surface tension .",
    "finally ( section  [ sec : method2 ] ) , we provide a summary and conclusions .",
    "the case of laplacian growth in the channel without surface tension was considered in detail by mark mineev - weinstein and dawson @xcite . in this case",
    ", the problem has an elegant analytical solution .",
    "moreover , they assumed that all major effects in the case with vanishingly small surface tension may also occur without surface tension .",
    "this would make it possible to apply the powerful analytical methods developed for the no surface tension case to the vanishingly small surface tension case .",
    "however , without additional assumptions , this hypothesis may not be accepted .",
    "the first objection is related to finite time singularities for some initial conditions .",
    "actually , for overcoming this difficulty , a regular item with surface tension was introduced .",
    "this surface tension item results in loss of the analytical solution . however , regularisation may be carried out much more simply - simply by rejecting the initial conditions that result in these singularities .",
    "the second objection is given in work by siegel and tanveer @xcite .",
    "there , it is shown that in numerical simulations in a case with any ( even vanishingly small ) surface tension , any initial thickness `` finger '' extends up to @xmath0 the width of the channel . the analytical solution in a case without surface tension results in a constant thickness of the  finger \" equal to its initial size , which may be arbitrary .",
    "siegel and tanveer , however , did not take into account the simple fact that numerical noise introduces small perturbation to the initial condition or even during  finger \" growth , which is equivalent to the remote poles , and with respect to this perturbation , the analytical solution with a constant  finger \"    it was shown by mark mineev - weinstein @xcite that similar pole perturbations for some initial conditions , can be extended to the siegel and tanveer solutions .",
    "this positive aspect of the paper @xcite was mentioned by sarkissian and levine in their comment @xcite . in summary , it is possible to determine that to identify the results with and without surface tension , it is necessary to introduce a permanent source of the new remote poles : the source may be either external noise or an infinite number of poles in an initial condition . which of these methods is preferred is still an open question .    in the case of flame",
    "front propagation , it was shown @xcite that external noise is necessary for an explanation of the flame front velocity increase with the size of the system : using an infinite number of poles in an initial condition can not give this result .",
    "it is interesting to know what the situation is in the channel laplacian growth .",
    "one of the main results of laplacian growth in the channel with a small surface tension is saffman - taylor  finger \" formation with a thickness equal to @xmath0 the thickness of the channel . to use the analytical result",
    "obtained for zero surface tension , it is necessary to prove that formation of the  finger \" also takes place without surface tension .    in our teamwork with mark",
    "mineev - weinstein @xcite , it was shown that for a finite number of poles at almost all allowed ( in the sense of not approaching finite time singularities ) initial conditions , except for a small number of degenerate initial conditions , there is an asymptotic solution involving a  finger \" with any possible thickness .",
    "note that the solutions and asymptotic behaviour found in @xcite for a finite number of poles are an idealisation but have a real sense for any finite intervals of time between the appearance of the new poles introduced into the system by external noise or connected to an entrance to the system of remote poles of an initial condition , including an infinite number of such poles .",
    "the theorem proved in @xcite may again be applied for this final set of new and old poles and again yields asymptotic behaviour in the form of a  finger \" , but the thickness is different .",
    "thus , introduction of a source of new poles results only in possible drift of the thickness of the final  finger \" but does not change the type of solution .",
    "it should be mentioned that instead of periodic boundary conditions , much more realistic  no flux \" boundary conditions may be introduced @xcite .",
    "( this paper repeats the result for single finger asymptotic behaviour already proved in the papers @xcite ) .",
    "this result forbids a stream through a wall , which inserts additional , probably useful restrictions on the positions , number , and parameters of new and old poles ( explaining , for example , why the sum of all complex parameters @xmath3 for poles gives the real value @xmath4 for the pole solution ( 5 ) in @xcite).however , this does not have an influence on the correctness and applicability of the results and methods proved in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "mark mineev - weinstein gives  proof \" that steady asymptotic behaviour for laplacian growth in a channel with zero surface tension is a single  finger \" with a thickness equal to @xmath0 the thickness of the channel , which is unequivocally erroneous .",
    "this is exactly the same method that was used in @xcite to prove and demonstrate the instability of a  finger \" with a thickness distinct from @xmath0 with respect to introducing new remote poles .",
    "the instability of a  finger \" with a thickness equal to @xmath0 may be proved and demonstrated !",
    "this objection was repeatedly made tomark mineev - weinstein before the publication of his paper @xcite .",
    "however , no answers can be found there .",
    "moreover , in our teamwork @xcite , it is shown that for a finite number of poles , any thickness  finger \" is possible as an asymptotic solution .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the privileged role of a  finger \" no surface tension ; it only means that the proof is not given in @xcite . let us try to give the correct arguments here .",
    "the general pole solution ( 5 ) in work @xcite is characterised by the real parameter @xmath4 being the sum of the complex parameters @xmath3 for poles .",
    "the thickness of the asymptotic finger is a simple function of @xmath4 : ( thickness = @xmath5 ) .",
    "the value ( @xmath6 ) corresponds to a thickness of @xmath0 .",
    "as far as possible , the thickness of the  finger \" is between 0 and 1 , and the possible @xmath4 value is in an interval between 0 and 2 : ( @xmath7 ) . the value @xmath6 corresponding to the finger width @xmath0 is exactly in the middle of this interval .",
    "what happens to the quite possible initial pole conditions with @xmath4 outside of the limits from 0 to 2 ?",
    "they are  not allowed \" because of the already identified finite time singularities @xcite . also , a part of the solutions inside the interval @xmath7 results in similar finite time singularities .    finding exact sufficient and necessary conditions when defining the initial pole condition as  not allowed \" , i.e. , singular , is still an open problem .",
    "how are these  not allowed \" initial pole conditions ( to be precise , their percentage from the full number of possible initial pole conditions corresponding to the given real value @xmath4 ) distributed inside of the interval @xmath7 ?    from reasons of continuity and symmetry with respect to @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ file=00003dfig.1 ] ) , it is possible to conclude that this distribution has a minimum at point @xmath6 ( thickness @xmath0 ! ) , the value that is the most remote from both borders of the interval @xmath7 , and that the distribution increases to the borders @xmath8 and 0 , reaching 100 percent for all pole solutions outside of these borders , i.e. , the thickness @xmath0 is the most probable because for this thickness value , the minimal percent of initial conditions potentially capable of producing such a thickness value is  not allowed \" , i.e. , results in singularities .",
    "a source of new poles results in drift of the finger thickness , but this thickness drift is close to the most probable and average size equal to @xmath0 .",
    "a similar result is obtained in the case of a saffman - taylor  finger \" with vanishingly small surface tension and with some external noise , which was one of the goals of the paper .",
    "it should be mentioned that these formulated arguments are only qualitative and that a strict proof is also necessary .",
    "in the absence of surface tension , the effect of which is to stabilise the short - wavelength perturbations of the interface , the problem of 2d laplacian growth is described as follows :    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is the scalar field mentioned , @xmath13 is the moving interface , @xmath14 is a fixed external boundary , @xmath15 is a component of the gradient normal to the boundary ( i.e. the normal derivative ) , and @xmath16 is a normal component of the velocity of the front .    now , we introduce physical  no - flux \" boundary conditions .",
    "this means no flux occurs across the lateral boundaries of the channel .",
    "this requires that the moving interface orthogonally intersects the walls of the channel .",
    "however , unlike the case of periodic boundary conditions , the end points at the two boundaries of the channel do not necessarily have the same vertical coordinate .",
    "nevertheless , this can also be considered as a periodic problem in which the period equals _",
    "twice _ the width of the channel .",
    "however , only half of this periodic strip should be considered as the physical channel , whereas the second half is its unphysical mirror image .",
    "then , we introduce a time - dependent conformal map @xmath17 from the lower half of a  mathematical \" plane , @xmath18 , to the domain of the physical plane , @xmath19 , where the laplace equation [ oqz2 ] is defined as @xmath20 .",
