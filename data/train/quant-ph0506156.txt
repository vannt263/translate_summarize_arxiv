    "quantum entanglement is a fascinating feature of quantum theory of many body systems @xcite . the concurrence @xcite , as a widely used measure of pairwise entanglement defined for the spin-1/2 systems , has been intensively investigated . through various concurrences defined by different authors ,",
    "people have explored the relations between entanglement and some physical observables such as energy and momentum etc .",
    "@xcite , as well as the relations between entanglement and some physical phenomena , such as quantum correlation @xcite and quantum phase transitions etc . @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", people have proposed many protocols for the quantum state transfer ( qst ) recently @xcite . in these schemes based on quantum spin systems , almost without any spatial or dynamical control over the interactions among qubits",
    ", the quantum state can be transferred with high fidelity through a quantum channel , or quantum data bus , which is necessary for scalable quantum computations based on realistic silicon devices .",
    "the physical process of qst through a quantum spin system can be understood as a dynamical permutation or translation preserving the initial shape of a quantum state , which can be realized as a specific evolution of the total quantum spin system from an initial wave function localized around a single site of the lattice to a distant one .",
    "the basic feature of qst is characterized by fidelity , which is usually the overlap of the identical image of an initial state with its transferred counterpart .",
    "this paper will be devoted to understand the intrinsic relation between quantum entanglement and qst for the engineered quantum spin chains , or quantitatively , between concurrence and fidelity .",
    "some rigorous results are obtained to reveal the essential relationship between these two fascinating issues for the tight - bonding bloch electrons .",
    "actually , the qst from one location to another can be considered as perfect if the fidelity can reach its maximum value one at some instants . literally , the perfect qst is a dynamic process starting from an initially factorized state ( product state ) to a finally factorized state through a middle process with the superposition of factorized states . since a superposition of single particle states of bloch electrons",
    "can be understood as a mode entanglement @xcite , the studies of qst can be naturally referred to the various phenomena of quantum entanglement .    motivated by arguments about the entanglement concurrence and the quantum correlations @xcite",
    ",  we first define the mirror mode concurrence ( mmc ) @xmath0 to characterize the mode entanglement of a wave packet in bloch electron systems with mirror symmetry .",
    "it will be proved that the mmc is no less than the overlap of the wave packet at time @xmath1 with its mirror image . by quantitatively comparing the mmc with the time dependent fidelity @xmath2 of qst , a novel complementary relation is discovered as the increase of @xmath2 is accompanied by a decrease of @xmath0 ( vice versa ) .",
    "especially , at the instant @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic time to accomplish a perfect qst with @xmath5 , the mmc can reach its maximum @xmath6an engineered bloch electron model with a certain spectrum structure , which admits perfect qst , is discovered and used to demonstrate this complementary relation through numerical simulations .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional bloch electron system in an engineered crystal lattice of @xmath7 sites with mirror symmetry with respect to the center of the lattice .",
    "the model hamiltonian with tight - bonding approximation is written as @xmath8 in terms of the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where the site - dependent coupling constants @xmath11 are real .",
    "the single - particle space is spanned by @xmath7 basis vectors@xmath12where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) denotes the fock state of fermion systems .",
    "then the reflection operator @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 .",
    "obviously , the mirror symmetry by @xmath18=0 $ ] means that @xmath19 .",
    "we describe the localized electron state around the @xmath20-th site as a superposition @xmath21 with the summation over the small domain containing the site @xmath20 .",
    "this assumption means that @xmath22 is a wave packet around the site @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath23 denotes another site far from the site @xmath20 , we can approximately assume the vanishing overlap @xmath24 for two wave packets @xmath22 and @xmath25 . with this assumption",
    "the perfect qst is described as the dynamic process that the initial state @xmath26 can evolve exactly into its mirror image .",
    "mathematically , the time evolution operator @xmath27 becomes the reflection operator @xmath16 at the instant @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "we define the fidelity as @xmath29a perfect qst can be depicted by the maximized fidelity @xmath30 .",
    "now we can intuitionally recognize that qst phenomenon is associated with the mode entanglement .",
    "in the terminology of mode entanglement , the single electron state @xmath31can be regarded as an entangled state if the single fermion at the @xmath15-th site and @xmath7-th site can be probed in principle @xcite . in this sense @xmath22",
    "can be viewed as an @xmath7-component entanglement .",
    "the perfect qst from @xmath32 to @xmath33 through the middle state @xmath34 can be understood as a dynamic process starts from a localized ( unentangled ) state @xmath35 to another localized state @xmath36 through the entangled state @xmath37 .",
    "actually a qst is a process , during which mode entanglement is generated first and then destroyed . to quantitatively characterize this dynamic feature , we define the mirror mode concurrence ( mmc ) @xmath38with respect to a pure state , evolved from a localized initial wave packet , @xmath39 . here",
    "each term @xmath40 in the summation concerns two separated sites , the site @xmath41 and its mirror imagine @xmath42  and is defined by the pairwise mode concurrence @xcite @xmath43constructed in terms of the correlation functions @xmath44and@xmath45where the average @xmath46 is defined with respect to the pure state @xmath47    the physical significance  will be in two folds that explicitly reveals the close relationship between the mode entanglement and the dispersion of the wave packet in time evolution .",
    "firstly we notice that @xmath48 and @xmath49  are the non - zero elements of the two mode reduced density matrix@xcite @xmath50for a system conserving total particle number , where @xmath51 means tracing over the variables besides the two on the sites @xmath41 and @xmath52 . in the single - particle subspace",
    "we have @xmath53 and thus @xmath54it is obvious that mmc is a generalization of the usual entanglement measure  concurrence and thus characterize the quantum entanglement in some sense .",
    "secondly the mmc defined above have a geometric interpretation for the dynamic dispersion of the wave packet .",
    "we rewrite the mmc as @xmath55where @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath57where we have used @xmath58 .",
    "the above equation clearly implies that @xmath0 is no less than the overlap integral of the state @xmath37 with its mirror image .",
    "especially , for a large class of states @xmath59 listed  in two situations as follows , @xmath0 is exactly equal to the overlap integral : ( i ) the electronic wave function are completely localized in a finite domain @xmath60 $ ] with no overlap with its mirror image @xmath61 $ ] . in this case , the mmc vanishes exactly .",
    "( ii ) the the coefficients of each pair of mirror symmetric non - zero components in @xmath37 have the same sign or opposite sign .    for a perfect qst accomplished at the instant @xmath62 ,",
    "the evolution operator @xmath63 becomes the reflection operator @xmath16 and @xmath64 evolves exactly into its mirror image @xmath65 . since the initial wave packet @xmath64 is usually a very localized wave function , the wave function @xmath66 and its mirror image @xmath67 almost do not overlap with each other ( see the illustration in fig .",
    "1 ) . thus we have @xmath68therefore , at @xmath62 , the mmc @xmath69 almost vanishes when the fidelity @xmath2 reaches its maximum ( @xmath5 ) .    from the above argument",
    "we see that there exists a quite interesting relationship between entanglement and fidelity .",
    "we provide a model more universal than the qst model in ref . [",
    "their mode is a mapping to the collective spin system with @xmath70 dynamic symmetry ( by @xmath71 more concretely ) , but our model only requires a much smaller mirror symmetry ( by @xmath19 more generally ) and thus have much  wider applications .",
    "in fact we have shown many examples in ref .",
    "li as well as in the following discussions .",
    "the further arguments about the complementarity relationship between entanglement and fidelity will also be  presented in such a general framework .",
    "the above analysis has confirmed our intuition about the complementary relation between the fidelity of qst and the mmc of mode entanglement . as for the other feature of this complementary relation ,",
    "we need to consider when the mmc can reach its maximum .",
    "obviously there exists the inequality @xmath72which takes the equal sign only when the wave function evolves into its mirror imagine , i.e. , @xmath73at some instants @xmath1 .",
    "this means that @xmath0 will reach its maximum @xmath74 at the instants when eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) holds .    in order to determine the time when @xmath0 reaches its maximum one , we need to solve the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) about time @xmath1 . to this end",
    "we use a time - independent real symmetric matrix @xmath75 to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath76 or the evolution operator @xmath77 as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a diagonal matrix . with these notations , the above equation ( eq1 )",
    "can be transformed into @xmath80where@xmath81we notice that , in general , @xmath82 .",
