    "in this lecture , i will be presenting a new characterization of an important and common ( but little known ) phenomenon in four - dimensional @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "this phenomenon , which goes by the name of `` manifolds of fixed points '' or `` exactly marginal operators '' , is familiar in two - dimensional field theory but has been little studied in four dimensions .",
    "a fixed point of a gauge theory is of course a point in the space of coupling parameters where the theory is conformally invariant ; all coupling constants are truly constant , with all beta functions vanishing and all of the physics scale - invariant .",
    "a theory may have many isolated fixed points , but it may also possess a continuous set  a manifold  of fixed points . in this case , starting from one such point , the lagrangian of the theory can be smoothly deformed in such a way that the quantum theory remains scale invariant .",
    "the operator which deforms the lagrangian is said to be an exactly marginal operator ; in four dimensions , its dimension is exactly four at every fixed point in the manifold .",
    "in general , dimensions of operators in quantum theories can not be computed exactly . however , in certain theories , including @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions , there is enough symmetry in the theory that certain anomalous dimensions are exactly known at fixed points , so operators can be shown to be exactly marginal and the existence of manifolds of fixed points can be confirmed .",
    "this fact was proven in ref .  , on which this talk is based .",
    "the methods which are necessary for this purpose are remarkably simple ; they merely require algebra . by this",
    "i do not mean abstract group theory  i mean the algebra we learned when we were children .",
    "from these methods we can make exact statements about the behavior of strongly coupled gauge theories , which allows us to clarify many old results and leads to many new ones .",
    "one application regards the relation between the electric - magnetic duality of @xmath2 theories@xcite and that of @xmath1 finite theories@xcite ; it can be shown that the first follows from the second.@xcite    some of our results on finite models are related to earlier work of lucchesi , piguet and sibold,@xcite though their methods are quite different from ours .",
    "given a quantum field theory , which has gauge group @xmath3 and is weakly coupled in the ultraviolet , how does it change ( flow ) under scaling transformations ?",
    "what is its behavior in the infrared ( ir ) ?",
    "there are a number of possibilities , which include :    1 .",
    "no light particles in the ir .",
    "the theory confines or is completely higgsed , and there is a mass gap .",
    "2 .   only goldstone bosons in the ir .",
    "the theory confines or is higgsed , but global symmetries are broken spontaneously ( as in qcd ) .",
    "3 .   weakly coupled gauge theory , with gauge group @xmath4 , in the ir .",
    "the theory is either partly broken ( as in the electroweak interactions ) or partly confined ( with light composite scalars and fermions potentially present . )",
    "weakly coupled gauge theory , with some other gauge group @xmath5 , in the ir .",
    "the gauge group @xmath3 is confined and a new gauge group emerges , with composite gauge bosons and matter emerging at low energies .",
    "5 .   interacting conformal fixed point in the ir .",
    "many gauge theories may flow to the same such point .",
    "answers 4 and 5 are the most exotic , and only recently has it been realized@xcite that these are in fact common situations in supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "i now turn to the specific issue of theories with ir fixed points .",
    "the fact that there are gauge theories in four dimensions that have non - trivial interacting fixed points has long been known .",
    "one need only consider the beta function for qcd with @xmath6 colors and @xmath7 flavors of quarks in the fundamental representation : [ eq : betaqcd ]    rcl ( g ) = - ; & + b_0 = n_c- n_f  ; b_1 = &  .",
    "here @xmath8 is the @xmath9-loop contribution to the beta function . for asymptotically free theories , all the coefficients @xmath10",
    "are of order at most @xmath11 .",
    "if we take @xmath7 very close to but less than @xmath12 , for @xmath6 large ( though not infinite ) , then the leading term in the beta function will be negative and of order @xmath13 while the next - to - leading term will be positive and of order @xmath14 .",
    "the beta function therefore appears to have a zero near @xmath15 .",
    "can we trust this zero ?",
    "yes ; for sufficiently large @xmath6 this value of the coupling is sufficiently small that the higher - order terms in the expansion of @xmath16 will not change its basic functional form at small @xmath17 .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the beta function is negative at very small @xmath18 but positive beyond some value .",
    "at the zero of the beta function lies a weakly interacting conformal field theory .",
    "this same argument applies in supersymmetric qcd ; for @xmath7 just less than @xmath19 there are fixed points at weak coupling .",
    "in fact , seiberg has argued@xcite ( and by now the evidence is overwhelming@xcite ) that such interacting field theories exist even for @xmath7 much less than @xmath19 , with couplings which in general are non - perturbatively strong .",
    "another theory which has conformal fixed points is @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "in fact , this theory is conformal for every value of the gauge coupling .",
    "let us consider a slightly more general theory ; take an @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theory , with three chiral superfields @xmath20 in the adjoint representation of the group , and with a superpotential @xmath21 where we do not assume @xmath22 and the gauge coupling @xmath17 are equal . in the space of all possible couplings @xmath23",
    "there are non - trivial beta functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; but on the line @xmath26 both beta functions vanish by @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "thus , in this @xmath2 theory there is a line of fixed points , labelled by @xmath17 ; it can easily be shown that these fixed points are infrared stable .",
    "( in fact , for @xmath27 there is a much larger manifold of fixed points which contains @xmath0 as a subspace ; see ref .  . )",
    "the variation of the lagrangian with respect to @xmath17 , @xmath28 , is an exactly marginal operator on the line @xmath26 .",
    "the reason for viewing the @xmath0 theory as a line inside the space of couplings of an @xmath2 theory is the following : there are many examples , known since the 1980s , in which an @xmath2 theory has a curve of fixed points inside the space of couplings , even though there is no special symmetry on this curve . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath0 is a special case of a much broader class of @xmath2 theories which have neither beta functions nor anomalous dimensions for their chiral superfields ; their effective actions are finite.@xcite these theories were the motivation for the principle of reduction of couplings@xcite mentioned in the talk of dr .",
    "i will now show that there is a simple way to understand why these theories exist , and that there are many theories which are _ not _ finite which nonetheless have manifolds of fixed points .",
    "the question i will now address is this : given a theory which is at a fixed point , whose lagrangian is @xmath29 , and which has an operator @xmath30 which is marginal ( dimension - four ) at the fixed point , under what circumstances is the theory with lagrangian @xmath31 still at a fixed point ? this is equivalent to asking whether the dimension of operator @xmath30 is still four when @xmath32 is non - zero .",
    "if the answer to this question is yes , then the operator is exactly marginal .    in general",
    ", this is a very difficult question to answer , even in two dimensions , unless the theory is exactly soluble .",
    "but remarkably , it is easy to answer this question for certain operators in @xmath2 @xmath33 supersymmetry .",
    "this follows from three important and little known facts about these theories :    1 .",
    "anomalous dimensions @xmath34 of charged matter fields are gauge invariant .",
    "2 .   if a term @xmath35 appears in the superpotential , then [ betah ] _ h where @xmath36 is the anomalous mass dimension of the field @xmath37 .",
    "3 .   for the gauge coupling @xmath17 ,",
    "the beta function , in terms of the second casimir invariant of the gauge group @xmath38 and the index @xmath39 of the representation @xmath40 , is [ betag ] _ g - ( + _ i t(r_i ) _ i ) where the sums are over all matter fields .",
    "notice the one - loop beta function coefficient @xmath41 appears in this formula .",
    "the expression ( [ betah ] ) follows directly from the non - perturbative non - renormalization theorem@xcite for the superpotential , while ( [ betag ] ) was proven to all orders in perturbation theory by shifman and vainshtein@xcite ( see also papers with novikov and zakharov@xcite ) .",
    "the latter is believed also to hold non - perturbatively because the zeroes of the beta function are related , by properties of the superconformal algebra of @xmath2 supersymmetry,@xcite to certain chiral anomalies , which can be computed at one loop .",
    "what is critical to note about these beta functions is that both are linear functionals of the anomalous dimensions @xmath36 of the matter fields @xmath37 .",
    "these anomalous dimensions are arbitrarily complicated functions of the coupling constants , but the relations between beta functions and anomalous dimensions are very simple .",
    "we will now see how this leads to a powerful and elegant result .",
    "the criterion for the existence of a fixed point is that all beta functions must vanish simultaneously .",
    "the equations @xmath42 put @xmath9 conditions on @xmath9 couplings .",
    "generically , we would expect these conditions are satisfied at isolated points in the space of couplings .",
    "however , because the beta functions are linear in the anomalous dimensions , it may happen that some of them are linearly dependent .",
    "if only @xmath43 of the beta functions are linearly independent , then the equations @xmath42 put only @xmath43 conditions on the @xmath9 couplings , so we expect that solutions to the equations generically occur on @xmath44 dimensional subspaces of the space of couplings , leading to @xmath44 dimensional manifolds of fixed points .",
    "thus , if some of the beta functions are linearly dependent , and there is at least one generic fixed point somewhere in the space of couplings , then the theory will have a manifold of fixed points .",
    "of course , it is possible that a theory has no fixed points at all ( other than the free fixed point , which is not generic . ) but in many theories , non - trivial fixed points are known or believed to exist , and in some cases these extend to entire manifolds .",
    "as a first example of such a theory , consider @xmath45 with fields @xmath46 @xmath47 in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 representations , with a superpotential [ suthreepot ] w = h ( q^1q^2q^3+q^4q^5q^6+q^7q^8q^9 + q_1q_2q_3 + q_4q_5q_6 + q_7q_8q_9 )  . the special properties of this theory were first noted in the 1980s.@xcite notice that the one - loop gauge beta function is zero and that the superpotential preserves enough of the flavor symmetry that all @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same anomalous dimension @xmath52 .",
    "the beta functions for the yukawa coupling and gauge coupling are [ suthreebta ] _",
    "hh(g , h ) ;   _ g-9(g , h )  . for both of these",
    "to vanish requires only the one condition @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for small @xmath57 , we conclude there is a line of fixed points passing through the origin of the space of couplings @xmath23 .",
    "there are a number of important facts worthy of note :    1 .   on the fixed line , by definition ,",
    "the theory is superconformal .",
    "since all beta functions and anomalous dimensions vanish , the effective action on the line is finite ( just as @xmath0 theories are finite . )",
    "we have not determined the function @xmath52 , but we did nt need to .",
    "the existence and properties of the fixed line only required that @xmath52 be zero somewhere .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath57 are small , we can compute @xmath52 in perturbation theory , while if @xmath57 are large this function is not useful anyway .",
    "the line of fixed points is ir stable ; if the couplings are near but off the line , they will approach the line at low energy .",
    "therefore , no fine tuning is required to put the theory on the line , which means these superconformal theories are physically interesting.@xcite    there are an enormous number of models with similar manifolds of fixed points passing through zero coupling ; these can be and were identified in perturbation theory.@xcite    as another example , consider an @xmath2 supersymmetric @xmath27 gauge theory with fields @xmath46 @xmath58 in the fundamental and antifundamental representations , a single field @xmath59 in the adjoint representation , and a superpotential [ ntwow ] w = hq^rq_r where the repeated index is summed over .",
    "for @xmath26 this theory has @xmath1 extended supersymmetry . in the case @xmath60 , the theory is finite on the line @xmath26 ; we can see this line of fixed points must exist using the fact that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are proportional to @xmath63 ( by symmetry , all @xmath46 have the same anomalous dimension ) . again",
    "the line of fixed points is infrared stable .",
    "but now let us add a mass for the field @xmath59 and integrate it out .",
    "the low energy theory is an @xmath2 @xmath27 gauge theory with the @xmath60 fields @xmath46 coupled by a non - renormalizable superpotential [ ntwoslw ] w = m^2 + h q^rq_r w_l = y  , where an @xmath27 fierz identity has been used to write the low energy superpotential @xmath64 in terms of gauge - invariant bilinears .",
    "this superpotential preserves enough flavor symmetry that all @xmath46 have the same anomalous dimension @xmath65 .",
    "the beta function for @xmath66 is @xmath67 while that of the gauge coupling is @xmath68 , which for @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore have a fixed point whenever @xmath70 .",
    "when the couplings @xmath71 are small , @xmath72 for positive coefficients @xmath73 ; @xmath74 at weak coupling , and any fixed point is therefore non - perturbative .",
    "the work of seiberg@xcite strongly suggests that there is a value of @xmath75 for which the theory with @xmath76 is at a stable fixed point .",
    "if this is true , then we expect that @xmath77 [ @xmath78 for @xmath79 [ @xmath80 .",
    "there must therefore be a line of stable fixed points , passing through the seiberg fixed point @xmath81 , which all have @xmath70 .    1 .   the fact that this theory has a quartic , non - renormalizable superpotential poses no difficulty . the low - energy theory is an effective theory valid below the mass of @xmath59 . above this mass",
    "the theory is renormalizable .",
    "in fact , one may redo the analysis in the renormalizable theory and obtain the same result concerning the existence of a fixed line .",
    "the coupling @xmath66 in ( [ ntwoslw ] ) has dimension of inverse mass , so one might ask how it can appear in a superconformal field theory .",
    "the reason is that the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath82 is @xmath83 at the fixed point ; this exactly cancels the naive dimension of the coupling @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   as before , the fixed line is ir stable , so no fine - tuning is required for the theory to be superconformal in the ir .    again , the number of similar examples is enormous.@xcite",
    "while there is insufficient space to present the full relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 duality , i will sketch the main ideas ; further discussion is to be found in ref .  .",
    "( in intervening months , an improved understanding of this relation has been achieved ; more up - to - date discussion can be found in ref .  .",
    ")    the @xmath1 finite @xmath27 theory , whose line of fixed points was discussed above , has the property that at every point along the @xmath1 fixed line , there are ( at least ) two equivalent descriptions of the superconformal theory.@xcite we may refer to the two sets of variables as electric and magnetic . in both variables the model is a finite @xmath1 @xmath27 theory , but the magnetic coupling @xmath84 is the inverse of the electric coupling @xmath17 , and the flavor quantum numbers are assigned differently in the two descriptions .",
    "when a mass is given to the field @xmath59 ( this occurs similarly in both sets of variables ) both descriptions flow to a low - energy theory consisting of an @xmath2 @xmath27 gauge theory with @xmath60 , as above .",
    "both theories have a superpotential of the form ( [ ntwoslw ] ) , but the coupling @xmath85 in the magnetic description is the inverse of @xmath66 in the electric description . if we take the coupling @xmath17 of the @xmath1 electric theory to be arbitrarily small , then the electric @xmath66 will be arbitrarily small as well ; in the limit , the @xmath2 electric superpotential is zero , but the theory will still flow from weak coupling @xmath86 to its fixed point @xmath87 since it is asymptotically free .    on the other hand , for large @xmath84 the magnetic theory will be at strong coupling , and will have a superpotential with a huge coefficient @xmath85 .",
    "but we may introduce an auxiliary gauge singlet field @xmath88 to rewrite it as follows .",
    "[ mw ] w_l^mag = -y m^r_s q_rq^s + ( m^r_sm^s_r - m^r_rm^s_s )  . in the limit that the magnetic theory is infinitely coupled ( which is the same limit we considered above for the electric theory ) the mass of the meson @xmath89 is zero and we are left with the superpotential [ magw ] w_l^mag = m^r_s q_rq^s  .",
    "we expect the low - energy @xmath2 magnetic theory to flow from infinite coupling back to its stable ir fixed point@xcite @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the duality of the @xmath1 theory implies that an @xmath2 @xmath27 gauge theory with @xmath60 and superpotential @xmath91 is dual to another @xmath27 theory with @xmath60 and mesons @xmath88 coupled by the superpotential @xmath92 .",
    "this is exactly what was found by seiberg in ref .  .",
    "more details of this relation may be checked.@xcite in particular , the mapping between operators found in ref",
    ".   is also recovered . using the mapping",
    ", one can flow away from the theory with @xmath60 and show that the @xmath27 theory with @xmath7 flavors has a magnetic dual which has @xmath93 gauge group , @xmath7 flavors , singlets @xmath88 , and the superpotential ( [ magw]).@xcite",
    "1 .   manifolds of fixed points are a common phenomenon in @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "2 .   these manifolds can easily be found , using simple algebraic methods .",
    "the `` finite '' @xmath2 models discovered ten years ago are easily understood using this language .",
    "proving a model is finite is often trivial with these methods .",
    "many `` non - finite '' , non - renormalizable , strongly coupled manifolds of fixed points have also been uncovered using this approach .",
    "these fixed points are usually ir stable , and are therefore of physical interest .",
    "manifolds of fixed points appear to play an important role in duality , as manifested by the relation discussed above between duality in finite @xmath1 models and seiberg s @xmath2 duality . 7 .   beyond those involving the principle of reduction of couplings@xcite",
    ", no applications to phenomenology have yet been suggested , but approximate fixed points have the potential to play an important role in supersymmetric model building .",
