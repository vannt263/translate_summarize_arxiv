    "unconventional condensate wavefunctions of paired fermions are identified by nontrivial representations of rotational symmetry , in contrast to the conventional counterpart with vanishing relative orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "exploration of unconventional condensates dates back to the investigations of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-phases of the superfluid @xmath3he @xcite and later the spin - triplet pairing in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 @xcite , which are characterized by the formation of cooper pairs with oam of @xmath6 and spin - triplet of @xmath7 .",
    "high @xmath8 cuprates are another celebrated example whose pairing symmetry is @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable discoveries , both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite , were reported on the single - boson condensation in the metastable high orbital bands of an optical lattice .",
    "the wavefunctions of this archetype of unconventional bose - einstein condensation ( ubec ) are identified by the nontrivial representations of the lattice symmetry group , which oversteps the physical scenario set by  no - node \" theorem - an underlying principle of low - temperature physics stating that the many - body ground - state wavefunctions of bose systems , including the superfluid , mott - insulating and supersolid states , are necessarily positive - definite under general circumstances @xcite . in consequence , the wavefunctions of ubecs can be rendered complex - valued , and thus spontaneously break the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry @xcite , which constitutes a remarkable feature of ubec .",
    "it is anticipated that ubecs can sustain exotic phenomena not seen in conventional becs , such as the nontrivial ordering of oam moment , becs with nonzero momentum , half - quantum vortex and the spin texture of skyrmions  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the oam moment formation still survives when system enters the mott - insulating regime wherein the global u(1 ) phase coherence of superfluidity is no longer retained  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of single - species becs in the second band , where the condensed atoms survive a long lifetime before tunnel to the nearly empty lowest band  @xcite , has marked an important progress towards the creation and manipulation of ubecs in ultracold atoms .",
    "depending on the lattice asymmetry , the time - of - flight  ( tof ) measurement revealed signatures of both real and complex condensates with @xmath0-wave symmetry and a large scale spatial coherence .",
    "the complex wavefunctions exhibit the configuration of a vortex - antivortex lattice with nodal points at vortex cores as theoretically predicted .",
    "more recently , a matter - wave interference technique was employed to provide direct observations of the phase information of the condensate and to identify the spatial geometry of certain low energy excitations @xcite .",
    "the realization of ubecs in even higher bands was also reported  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical study of the ubec in a two - species boson mixture where both species are equally populated in the second band of a bipartite optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "our study initiates the search of new types of ubecs enriched by coupling spin degrees of freedom with u(1 ) symmetry , tr symmetry and nontrivial representations of the lattice symmetry groups . to determine the wavefunction of the ubec in the context of gross - pitaevskii equation  ( gpe ) , we develop a numerical scheme which resorts to precluding the @xmath10-orbital components from the condensate wavefunction during the imaginary - time evolution of the full hamiltonian .",
    "this scheme enables us to determine the phase diagram of ubec in a wide range of parameters corresponding to the inter- and intraspecies interaction .",
    "we find that the emergent phases of ubec involve the @xmath11 ( complex - valued ) and @xmath12 ( real - valued ) types of orbital order , which appear in different regimes of interaction that can be described as a consequence of the interplay between oam and interaction energies , as will be discussed later .",

    "the current study paves the way for approaching the least explored @xmath0-orbital physics of multi - species bosonic systems .",
    "our theory can be also generalized to study the superfluity and magnetism of spinful @xmath0-orbital condensation in the presence of spin - dependent optical lattices or exotic spin - exchange interactions .",
    "we have used the gpe method throughout this article , whose applicability is justified in the limit of weak inter - species interaction . in this case , the two - species problem studied here is reduced to two weakly coupled single - species problems , for which previous works show that the gpe equation has captured the essential physics of the complex @xmath0-orbital condensates being the energy - minima . when the interspecies interaction becomes stronger , however , the entanglement between two - species would become important . in this case , indeed more exotic states beyond the gpe level is also possible .",
    "for example , the singlet paired boson condensation , whose spatial pair - wavefunctions are antisymmetrized , and thus reduces the inter - species repulsion .",
    "this state is highly entangled and beyond the gpe equation level . nevertheless , the mean - field gpe equation is still a natural beginning point on this challenging problem .",
    "the checkerboard state already investigated in this article remains a potential competing state , then both species avoid each other in their real - space density distributions characterized by a staggered spin - density structure , which also greatly reduces the interspecies repulsion . we would leave a detailed study on novel states beyond the mean - field gpe level and their competitions with the single - boson condensate for a future publication .    _",
