    "massive stars appear to be formed in the dense cores of massive cold clouds ( garay & lizano 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the accumulation of gas in the core might proceed through previous stages of fragmentation and coalescence progressively generating a massive protostar that then accretes from the environment ( e.g. bonnell , bate & zinnecker 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative picture is direct accretion onto a central object of very high mass ( e.g. rodrguez et al .",
    "2008 ; see shu et al .",
    "1987 for the basic mechanism ) . in any case",
    ", the prestellar core is expected to have angular momentum which would lead to the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "the strong magnetic fields inside the cloud that thread the disk should be pulled toward the protostar and twisted by the rotation giving rise to a magnetic tower , with the consequent outflows , as shown by numerical simulations ( e.g. banerjee & pudritz 2007 ) .",
    "evidence supporting the existence of molecular outflows is found through methanol masers , which are likely associated with shocks formed by the interaction with the external medium ( e.g. plambeck & menten 1990 ) . however , the most important piece of evidence for outflows is in the form of thermal radio jets .",
    "these jets are observed to propagate through the cloud material along distances of a fraction of a parsec in some cases ( e.g. mart et al . 1993 ) . at the end point of the jets , hot spots due to the terminal shocks",
    "are observed in several sources . in a few cases ,",
    "these hot spots are clearly non - thermal , indicating the presence of relativistic electrons that produce synchrotron radiation ( e.g. araudo et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .    a population of relativistic particles in the complex environment of the massive molecular cloud where the protostar is being formed will produce high - energy radiation through a variety of processes : inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of ir photons from the cloud , relativistic bremsstrahlung , and , if protons are accelerated at the shock as well , inelastic proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) collisions .",
    "if such a radiation is detectable , @xmath1-ray astronomy can be used to shed light on the star forming process , the protostar environment , and cosmic ray acceleration inside molecular clouds . in the present contribution",
    "we want to discuss the conditions under what massive protostars can produce @xmath1 rays detectable by the _ fermi _ satellite in the immediate future , and also whether cherenkov telescopes may eventually detect these sources .",
    "the models presented here incorporate many refinements from the simpler approach published by araudo et al .",
    "the basic scenario has been outlined in fig . 1 of araudo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . a massive young stellar object ( yso ) , or a group of them ,",
    "is embedded into a molecular cloud .",
    "the protostar heats the cloud in such a way that it can be detected as a strong ir source , with luminosities in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 erg s@xmath0 whereas the optical counterpart is obscured by the cloud . masses and sizes of these clouds are of the order of @xmath6  @xmath7 and few pc , respectively ( e.g. garay & lizano 1999 ) .",
    "the thermal jets can propagate up to distances of @xmath8 cm from the central source , and the non - thermal radio lobes are seen at distances of @xmath9 pc from the protostar ( mart et al .",
    "1993 , garay et al .",
    "2003 ) with sizes of the order of 1 % this distance .",
    "the radio lobes are ionised by the terminal shocks and particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies both in the reverse shock , as well as in the forward shock in the ionised gas . in what follows",
    "we will discuss the characteristics of the non - thermal particle population of the lobes arose from forward and reverse shocks .",
    "a crucial parameter for the acceleration of particles up to high energies is the magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "equipartition calculations with the non - thermal population of particles ( araudo et al .",
    "2007 ) and zeeman measurements ( e.g. crutcher 1999 ) suggest @xmath11  mg .",
    "magnetic fields are thought to play an important role supporting the cloud before the gravitational collapse , allowing high densities in the cores to be achieved ( e.g. mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "the medium density strongly determines the jet evolution , and is a key factor regarding the emission at high energies .    here , we consider the effect of both a forward and a reverse shock , the escape of the particles from the acceleration region , and the illumination of the whole molecular cloud by protons that diffuse from the lobes , among others refinements with respect to our previous work .",
    "the cloud acts as reservoir of locally accelerated cosmic rays . in very massive clouds , where several protostars are forming",
    ", this effect can be very significative .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa , e.g. drury 1983 ) can operate in the turbulent region at the termination of the thermal jets .",
    "if the jet head is still moving in the free propagation phase , the bow shock in the cloud can be as fast as the jet , but then the shock luminosity must be smaller than the one carried by the jet ( @xmath12 ) . in any case ,",
    "regardless the energy budget , the fast velocities allow particle acceleration up to very high energies . on the other hand ,",
    "when the swept cloud material is massive enough , the jet slows down and the bow shock produced by the interaction can be as slow as @xmath13  km  s@xmath0",
    ". the shocked material of the cloud will be radiative , forming a very thin shell pushed by the jet .",
    "this shock is not suitable to accelerate particles , but its downstream material would be a good target for @xmath2 interactions or relativistic bremsstrahlung in case that electrons and protons accelerated elsewhere could reach it . in the slow bow - shock case ,",
    "the region suitable for particle acceleration is the reverse shock formed in the jet , which was not strong when the bow shock was moving as fast as the jet itself ( being an effective accelerator ) .",
    "when the bow shock has slowed significantly down , the reverse shock has a velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the shock luminosity in the slow bow - shock case is similar to the jet one .    in any case",
    "( bow shock or reverse shock acceleration ) , the particle acceleration rate for a parallel non - relativistic strong shock in the test particle approximation is    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for electrons and protons , respectively ( e.g. protheroe 1999 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is the ratio of the mean free path of the particles to their gyro - radius @xmath19 .",
    "close to the bohm limit , where the diffusion coefficient is @xmath20 , @xmath21 . for outflows with bulk velocities",
    "@xmath22  km  s@xmath0 ( e.g. mart et al .",
    "1995 ) we get a relatively low efficiency of @xmath23 , which is , nonetheless , enough to achieve relativistic energies for the particles .",
    "the relevant energy loss for protons is due to @xmath2 collisions with the nuclei of the ambient gas of density @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , is the interaction cross section ( kelner at al . 2006 ) and @xmath28 the inelasticity .",
    "the emission from @xmath2 interactions can be significant from high- to very high - energy @xmath1 rays .",
    "in addition to the radiative losses , protons can escape from the emitting region of size @xmath29 by diffusion or convection downstream the shock , in accordance with the timescales of these processes : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the escape time @xmath32 is defined as the minimum between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the presence of a turbulent @xmath35 mg or higher",
    ", @xmath34 will usually be shorter than @xmath33 and @xmath36 . nevertheless , in the cases studied here",
    "the most energetic protons have their energy constrained by diffusive escape upstream .",
    "the main losses for electrons are due to synchrotron radiation , ic up - scattering of ir photons , and relativistic bremsstrahlung .",
    "the standard formulae are presented , for instance , in blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) .",
    "synchrotron and ic losses in the thomson regime satisfy : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the magnetic energy density ( @xmath39  erg  @xmath40 for @xmath41  mg ) , and @xmath42 is the photon energy density inside the cloud , typically @xmath43  erg  @xmath40 , which is dominated by ir photons .",
    "this means that synchrotron losses will dominate over ic cooling .",
    "the highest energy electrons will cool via synchrotron and they will radiate from radio to soft x - rays through this mechanism . on the other hand , lower",
    "energy electrons are dominated by relativistic bremsstrahlung and escape losses from the emitter .",
    "the relativistic bremsstrahlung component contributes to the spectrum from hard x - rays up to high energies .",
    "for very high densities , ionization / coulomb collision losses may dominate radio emitting electrons , hardening their spectra .",
    "an observed steep radio spectrum implies that this cooling channel is minor in comparison to synchrotron radiation .      in the bohm limit",
    "we expect for electrons that the maximum energy will be determined by the radiative losses . equating energy gains and losses we get , for the parameters of the basic scenario sketched in sect .",
    "[ sce ] , that @xmath44 tev . for protons , on the contrary , cooling times are longer and hence they can diffuse away from the shock upstream into the cloud .",
    "the residence time in the shock region , of size @xmath45 , determines the maximum energy : @xmath46 tev .",
    "the particle distributions @xmath47 are given by the transport equation ( e.g. ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) : @xmath48}{\\partial e_{e , p}}+\\frac{n_{e , p } \\left(t , e_{e , p}\\right)}{t_{\\rm esc}}=q_{e , p}(t , e_{e , p } ) , \\label{ginz_equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the function for the particle injection ( a power law according to the dsa mechanism which is supposed to operate in the radio lobes ) .",
    "injection takes place during the lifetime of the source ( @xmath50 ) , estimated typically in @xmath51  yr @xmath52  s for massive o protostars ( see garay et  al .",
    "2003 ) . in the transport equation",
    "@xmath53 is time , and @xmath54 is the summation of all energy losses .",
    "( [ ginz_equation ] ) can be solved in the steady state setting @xmath55 . in the cases when synchrotron dominates over escape or relativistic bremsstrahlung",
    ", the electron distribution will be @xmath56 at high energies .",
    "relativistic bremsstrahlung losses and escape , on the contrary , lead to @xmath57 .",
    "the injected proton spectrum is not modified since the relevant losses , due to inelastic @xmath2 collisions , are almost linear with the energy in the range considered ( from @xmath9 100  mev to tev ) @xmath58 .",
    "the normalization of the electron spectrum is given by the observed radio luminosities , between @xmath59 and @xmath60  erg  s@xmath0 for sources like hh 80 - 81 ( mart et al . 1993 ) and iras  16547@xmath614247 ( rodrguez et al .",
    "the proton to electron energy density ratio , @xmath62 , can not be established from first principles in the acceleration process and it should be considered as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "all this fixes the luminosity injected in non - thermal particles ( @xmath63 ) . in the next section",
    "we will consider two cases : one with only electrons ( @xmath64 ) and another dominated by protons , with a ratio @xmath65 , as observed in galactic cosmic rays .",
    "once the particle energy distribution @xmath66 has been obtained through eq .",
    "( [ ginz_equation ] ) , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be calculated as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the particle emissivity of the particular radiation process and @xmath69 is the specific luminosity .",
    "the powerful ir source iras  16547@xmath614247 is composed by a massive protostar embedded in a very dense and luminous molecular cloud ( garay et al .",
    "in addition , two radio lobes are at the end of the thermal jets of the central yso , being the south one clearly non - thermal .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ( _ left _ )",
    "we show an example of the sed for the non - thermal lobe of the iras source , where only primary electrons have been considered . in this specific case ,",
    "the reverse shock is accelerating particles since the cloud material is very dense and the bow shock has been already slowed down .",
    "densities have been taken as high as possible accounting for the ionization cooling limit .",
    "the parameters used in the modeling are presented in table  [ tab ] .",
    "this example shows that , despite the ic contribution is negligible , @xmath1-rays might still be of leptonic origin if densities are particularly high .",
    "the spectral shape is determined by the escape of electrons from the emitter ( this was not considered in araudo et al .",
    "the sed has two clear peaks , one due to synchrotron radiation and the second one due to relativistic bremsstrahlung .",
    "the latter emission extends into the @xmath1-ray domain with integrated luminosities of @xmath70 and @xmath71  erg  s@xmath0 at @xmath72 and @xmath73  gev , respectively .",
    "the emission for the case with @xmath65 has been also estimated but not shown in the present paper .",
    "synchrotron emission is now dominated by secondary pairs , and the @xmath2 in the lobe reaches integrated luminosities of @xmath74 and @xmath75  erg  s@xmath0 at @xmath72 and @xmath73  gev , respectively .",
    "the herbig - haro objects hh  80 and hh  81 are located at the terminal point of a massive yso jet .",
    "the triple system composed by the central yso plus hh  80 - 81 and hh  80 north is at the edge of a dark cloud ( mart et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ( _ right _ ) , we show a case dominated by protons , with @xmath65 , for the source hh  80 .",
    "given the lower densities of the environment , the bow shock could still move fast and therefore be an efficient particle accelerator . in this source",
    "the radio emission is still produced by primary electrons , with some contribution from secondary pairs injected through the decay of charged pions . at high energies",
    "the ic and the relativistic bremsstrahlung are negligible and the emission is dominated by @xmath1 rays originated in neutral pion decays from @xmath2 interactions .",
    "the @xmath1-ray cutoff appears at energies @xmath76 .",
    "the total @xmath1-ray integrated luminosities from the lobe can reach @xmath77  erg  s@xmath0 .",
    "however , since protons can diffuse out the acceleration region with significant energy due to their long cooling times , the interaction with the cold material of the cloud will add a diffuse component ( aharonian & atoyan 1996 ) .",
    "this emission could look marginally extended for current cherenkov telescopes and _ fermi_. the diffuse radiation from the massive molecular cloud can increase the @xmath1-ray integrated luminosity to the level of @xmath78 and @xmath79  erg  s@xmath0 at @xmath80 and @xmath73  gev , respectively , rendering the source detectable .",
    "the leptonic case ( a=0 ) for the object hh  80 was also computed but the luminosities at high energies are well below @xmath60  erg  s@xmath0 and the spectra are not shown here .",

    "in the present contribution , we study the production of @xmath1-ray emission at the terminal points of jets that emanate from massive protostars . in particular , we consider two sources : iras  16547 - 4247 and hh  80 - 81 . in the former case ,",

    ", the detection of massive protostars at @xmath1-ray energies would open a new window to star formation studies .",
