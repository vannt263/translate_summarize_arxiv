    "since the discovery of dark energy @xcite most of the attempts to understand it have consisted of guessing an equation of state as a function of the redshift parameter , @xmath0 , evaluating one integral over @xmath0 to determine the dark energy density and then another , necessarily numerical , integral to find a luminosity distance which can be compared with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "thus it is not surprising that there is a lot of degeneracy  different equations of state give similar or even almost identical fits .",
    "what we do here is guess a form for the luminosity distance and confront our guess with the data straight away .",
    "then we need only differentiate it once with respect to @xmath0 to find the dark energy density and once more to find the equation of state .",
    "thus we can , in principle , have analytic expressions for everything .",
    "this is not totally elementary , however , since a best fit to our guess for the luminosity distance , @xmath1 , can result in an expression which violates some known property of @xmath1 .",
    "these properties are automatically satisfied in the bottom - up approach . for example",
    ", the supernova data are bounded from above by the curve for dark energy alone , @xmath2 , and from below by the curve for only matter , @xmath3 $ ] , so it natural to try a fit of the form @xmath4 \\,.\\ ] ] the best fit to this , using the data of ref.@xcite and a flat universe , is @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , this grows faster than @xmath0 at large @xmath0 and , as we show below , that is not allowed because the density of dark energy would be negative for some values of @xmath0 .",
    "the direct or top - down approach discussed here was introduced in a paper by saini , raychaudhury , sahni and starobinsky @xcite for a flat universe .",
    "a reexamination of the results in this paper is included in what follows . in the next section we give some formalism and derive some conditions that the luminosity distance must satisfy . in section 3",
    "we make a few guesses for @xmath1 , including the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , and fit them to the data . finally in sec .",
    "4 we offer some discussion .",
    "the relevant parameters are the matter density and the curvature defined as @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the current values of the matter density , the hubble parameter , and the scale , and @xmath11 or @xmath12 . with this method",
    "@xmath13 is not a parameter which can be fit so , for simplicity , we will fix @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is greater than or equal to zero then the ( dimensionless ) luminosity distance is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter , @xmath18 with @xmath19 given in terms of the equation of state for dark energy , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 is less than zero the the hyperbolic sine in eq.([dl ] ) is replaced by the ordinary sine and @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "however , after we take one derivative our expressions will be valid for all @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath25 for all @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest and most obvious of the conditions on @xmath1 is that it must be positive for all @xmath0 .",
    "also , for @xmath27 , @xmath1 must equal @xmath0 , @xmath28    now to go further we need to solve eq.([dl ] ) for @xmath19 , so rewrite it as @xmath29^ { ' } \\,=\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{\\,\\omega_k}\\,h_0}{h(z)}\\,,\\ ] ] where the prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath0 . differentiating the @xmath30",
    "gives @xmath31^{'}\\,\\frac{1\\,+\\,z}{\\sqrt{(1+z)^2+\\omega_k\\,d_l^2(z)}}\\,= \\,\\frac{h_0}{h(z)}\\,,\\ ] ] or , finally , using eq.([h ] ) , @xmath32 eq.([der3 ] ) is valid for all @xmath23 .",
    "introducing @xmath33 as @xmath34 we note that , from eq.([der3 ] ) , @xmath33 must be positive .",
    "this is not always easy to satisfy . solving eq.([der3 ] ) for @xmath19",
    "gives @xmath35 since @xmath19 must be positive the terms in the @xmath36 brackets must be positive .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath37 , we want the energy density in dark energy to be less than that of matter , i.e. , @xmath38 so eq.([feq ] ) gives @xmath39 and , from eq.([zbt1 ] ) we have @xmath40    these conditions can be somewhat simplified by writing eq.([dl ] ) for @xmath1 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 if @xmath15 is zero .",
    "then @xmath19 of eq.([feq ] ) reduces to @xmath43 with @xmath44 @xmath33 , given by eq.([d1 ] ) , is proportional to @xmath45 and thus @xmath45 must be positive .    the constraint equations ( [ allz ] ) and ( [ zbig ] ) become @xmath46 where the first inequality holds for all @xmath0 and the second is valid only for @xmath47 . for @xmath0 large the only solution which satisfies this and has @xmath48 positive is @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 positive constants .",
    "the @xmath50 term , whose leading @xmath0 behavior cancels in @xmath52 , is necessary to keep @xmath52 positive . for the cosmological constant case , where @xmath53 for all @xmath0 , @xmath51 equals @xmath54 . for small @xmath0",
    ", @xmath48 must , of course , go as @xmath0 .",
    "then , to leading order in @xmath0 , eq.([allbigz ] ) becomes @xmath55 with @xmath56 condition ( [ approx ] ) is not perfect because it is only valid to leading order in @xmath57 which is at most @xmath58 . in some models , such as eq.([todd ] ) in the next section , the next term in eq.([ybigz ] ) , the constant term , is large and making it impossible to satisfy eq.([allbigz ] ) .",
    "consequently , condition ( [ approx ] ) is a necessary but not a sufficient condition and for each fit to the data it is still necessary to check that the conditions in eq.([allbigz ] ) are satisfied .",
    "eq.([approx ] ) is only a guide as to where to look for a solution .",
    "once we find a model which satisfies these constraints , the dark energy equation of state is given by @xmath59 which , using eq.([fy ] ) , can be written as @xmath60 note that if we wish to satisfy the condition that @xmath61 then @xmath62 i.e. , @xmath63 must increase with @xmath0 ( just not as fast as @xmath64 ) .",
    "we will not worry about restricting @xmath65 in this paper .",
    "for the data we use the `` gold '' set of ref.@xcite plus the seven events given in ref.@xcite the total of which we will call the `` essence '' data .",
    "we also use the data set of ref.@xcite which we call the `` legacy '' data .",
    "we compare these data sets with @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an offset we fit as an extra parameter .",
    "wmap @xcite gives a comoving distance to the decoupling surface and we translate this into a ( dimensionless ) luminosity distance and add it to whichever of the two data sets we are using @xcite .",
    "specifically , for this point we take @xmath68 at @xmath69 and we add it with no offset .    from the previous section",
    "what is needed are expressions for @xmath48 which give @xmath70 for @xmath27 , behave as eq.([ybigz ] ) for @xmath47 , and have @xmath71 for all @xmath0 . the model which most closely resembles the form discussed in the introduction but also satisfies these conditions is @xmath72\\ ] ] with @xmath73 for @xmath14 the best fit to the essence data gives @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 of 187.1 but , for large @xmath0",
    ", the ratio of energy densities @xmath78 is much too large , @xmath79 .",
    "if we fix @xmath80 at @xmath81 a fit gives @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 . in",
    "is shown for the @xmath48 of eq.([yss ] ) using the essence data with @xmath85 and @xmath86.[td2ratio],width=288 ]     is shown for the @xmath48 of eq.([yss ] ) using the essence data with @xmath85 and @xmath86.[td2ratio],width=288 ]    fig.[td2contour ] we show the @xmath87 confidence contour in the @xmath88 plane together with the best fit and the @xmath89 , @xmath85 point .",
    "the latter gives a somewhat better ratio of energy densities at large @xmath0 of @xmath90 , as shown in fig.[td2ratio ] .",
    "for @xmath80 below @xmath81 , @xmath91 ( @xmath19 ) is not positive for all @xmath0 .",
    "the legacy data with @xmath92 gives @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the ratio of energy densities at large @xmath0 is @xmath96 .",
    "thus the two data sets give essentially the same answer for the parameters and results consistent with @xmath97 .",
    "another expression for @xmath48 which satifies the condition ( [ ybigz ] ) is @xmath98^{n}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath80 of eq.([approx ] ) is given by @xmath99     is shown for the @xmath48 of eq.([yrn ] ) using the essence data with @xmath100 and @xmath86.[td1ratio],width=288 ]     is shown for the @xmath48 of eq.([yrn ] ) using the essence data with @xmath100 and @xmath86.[td1ratio],width=288 ]    unlike the model given in eq.([yss ] ) , the ratio of energy densities @xmath78 seems to be positive for all values of @xmath80 which satisfy condition([approx ] ) but , like the case of eq.([yss ] ) , this ratio is never very small .",
    "it turns out that the minimum @xmath77 occurs when @xmath101 .",
    "then to satisfy condition ( [ approx ] ) together with eq.([xx ] ) requires @xmath102 , which , in turn , forces @xmath103 to be very large in order to cancel the small denominator in eq.([xx ] ) .",
    "this gives a lot of degeneracy .",
    "for example , using the essence data , the minimum in @xmath77 occurs at @xmath104 when the @xmath80 parameter is 0.3 , the other parameters are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and the ratio of energy densities at large @xmath0 is @xmath109 .",
    "but if we allow @xmath77 to increase by one we can leave @xmath80 unchanged , have @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 as shown in fig.[td1contour ] . in this case , the ratio of energy densities at high @xmath0 is @xmath114 and its behavior is illustrated in fig.[td1ratio ] .",
    "the legacy data gives very similar results although allowing @xmath77 to change by one only gets @xmath103 down to @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the only surprise is that the @xmath77 is larger than expected at @xmath118 .    a brute force expression for @xmath48 is @xmath119 with @xmath50 , @xmath120 , @xmath51 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 greater than zero and @xmath103 greater than @xmath123 .",
    "at large @xmath0 the first and second terms on the right - hand - side reproduce eq.([ybigz ] ) while at small @xmath0 the last term gives the desired linear dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "but this expression does nt seem to work at all .",
    "a fit to the data gives seemingly reasonable values for @xmath77 and for the parameters ; for example , using the essence data we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "but the omitted constant term of eq.([ybigz ] ) is equal to @xmath127 which is large enough that the lower bound in eq.([allbigz ] ) is always violated for some values of @xmath0 .",
    "finally we consider the model given in ref.@xcite which in our notation is @xmath128\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath129 for the essence data the minimum @xmath77 occurs at @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "this @xmath77 is smaller than those obtained for the models above , in particular model ( [ yss ] ) , but this probably is nt particularly significant ; for @xmath15 equal to zero @xmath77 jumps to 188.4 .",
    "the ratio of energy densities at large @xmath0 is 0.12 which is about the same as model ( [ yss ] ) .",
    "if we push the parameters to the lower bounds given by the errors the energy density ratio gets smaller but at the upper bounds it is unreasonably high ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the legacy data gives a reasonable fit with @xmath133 , but the central values of the parameters give a dark energy density which is negative for @xmath134 . here ,",
    "too , there are values of the parameters within the errors that result in a positive dark energy density for all @xmath0 .",
    "2 we derived some necessary conditions to be used as a guide in implementing this top - down approach for studying the dark energy . the simple models in sec . 3",
    "show that these conditions are not always sufficient . the model given by eq.([todd ] )",
    "satisfies the conditions but has no solution for the parameters which works for all @xmath0 . the model given by eq.([yrn ] ) is worse in the sense that it has satisfactory solutions for an extremely wide range of values of the parameters . knowing that a model does not work is useful since we can proceed to other forms .",
    "having a model which works but where we can not gainfully limit the parameters leaves us in a sort of limbo .",
    "in short the problem of degeneracy so prevalent in the bottom - up approach is no less severe here .",
    "in addition this model has a large bump in the ratio of the energy densities around @xmath135 ( see fig.[td1ratio ] ) which seems unlikely to be physical .",
    "thus we are left with the models of eq.([yss ] ) or eq.([s4 ] ) . for model ( [ yss ] )",
    "the best fit has an energy density ratio , @xmath78 , which does not go to zero at large @xmath0 but we can adjust the parameters to find a model where the ratio does get small without too much penalty in @xmath77 . this is the case shown in figs.[td2contour ] and [ td2ratio ] .",
    "even then the model is not without problems .",
    "the equation of state @xmath65 , as calculated from eq.([wp ] ) , is less than @xmath12 at @xmath136 , but we have agreed not to worry about conditions on @xmath65 here ; even in a bottom - up approach it is not always possible to find fits to the data satisfying @xmath61 for all @xmath0 .    in some ways the model given by eq.([s4 ] ) is the most satisfactory .",
    "it can have a small @xmath77 if we allow @xmath15 to be nonzero and it can have small values for the ratio of dark energy to matter densities at large redshift if we allow the parameters to be one sigma off the minimum in the most favorable direction . however , if the parameters shift in the other direction the model rapidly becomes very unsatisfactory . also here again @xmath137 is less than @xmath12 , sometimes much less .    on the positive side",
    "the data seem well behaved . for other reasons",
    "we think that @xmath15 must be zero so it is pleasing to see that both data sets are consistent with this for the cases that we tried .",
    "the predictions for the parameters were also very similar for the two sets .",
    "however , a big part of this agreement may come from our inclusion of the wmap point which has a strong normalizing effect .    in summary",
    "it seems very hard to guess a form for the luminosity distance , @xmath1 , which gives results that are physically sensible .",
    "this is not a problem in the bottom - up method .",
    "there it is all too easy to guess forms for @xmath65 which are sensible physically and automatically satisfy the conditions given above .",
    "also the analytic solutions for the dark energy equation of state , which certainly exist in this top - down method , and are one of the main reasons for this approach , are likely to be rather complicated ( see eq.([wp ] ) ) .",
    "so it is hard to know whether , with more data , this scheme of directly fitting the luminosity distances will be useful .",
