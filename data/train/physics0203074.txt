    "the euler ( or the navier - stokes ) equations for fluid flows in a non - conservative form are selected as the governing equations , and the convection terms in the equations are solved explicitly by the cip method @xcite , while the acoustic terms are solved implicitly by the cup method @xcite . in part",
    "i of this series @xcite , an improved solver for the convection terms was constructed using both an interpolation and an extrapolation function to describe the spatial profile of the density of materials . in the improved method ,",

    "this technique reduces the computational effort by integrating only rapidly varying components of a system ( e.g. , strongly accelerated particles or waves having fast phase speeds ) with a small time interval , and others with a larger time interval . in the present study , based on this concept , different - nature terms in the fluid equations (",

    "this modification allows us a more flexible determination of the time interval , and improves the accuracy and efficiency of the cip - cup . as will be shown , the adaptation of the mts concept to the cip - cup integration is straightforward , because the cip - cup separately treats the terms having different natures , i.e. , those having different characteristic time scales .",

    "this simplification may be valid because @xmath56 generally .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an alternative variant was proposed .",
    "though this variant can provide higher resolution of the sound wave than that obtained by ito s variant , it is likely that the use of this variant as a part of the solver for fluid flows sometimes causes great violation of mass conservation @xcite .",
    "we therefore did not adapt it .",
    "in many fluid flow problems , the time scale of a significant phenomenon is determined by the flow velocity ( i.e. , the characteristic speed of the convection parts ) , rather than by the sound speed or other characteristic speed . in certain cases , however , the acoustic parts ( or others ) have much smaller time scales ( i.e. , much greater characteristic speeds ) , resulting in an excessive restriction on the time interval , @xmath19 . the cip - cup overcomes this problem by solving the acoustic parts implicitly .",
    "such an approach , however , guarantees only the stability , and probably provides inaccurate results in certain situations .",
    "for example , under an intermediate condition of flows such as weakly compressible flows , the acoustic parts may need to be solved by using a time interval of sufficiently small @xmath57 that makes @xmath58 very small , since the compressibility described by the acoustic parts plays an important role , where    @xmath59    to achieve an efficient computation even in such a situation , we adopt the multi - time - step ( mts ) integration technique to the cip - cup method .",
    "the adaptation of the mts integration to the cip - cup is straightforward because the components of different time scales ( convection , sound propagation , and others ) are treated separately .",
    "the time propagation performed in the cip - cup can be represented schematically as follows :    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and the operators @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 indicate the discrete propagators for the corresponding integration steps ( the convection , the additional , and the acoustic steps , respectively ) .",
    "these equations can be summarized as    @xmath67    if we factor @xmath65 and @xmath66 into some identical pieces , we get    @xmath68^{m3 } [ l2(\\delta t / m2)]^{m2 } l1(\\delta t)\\,{\\bf u}^n , \\ ] ]    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are positive integers .",
    "this equation means that , after solving the convection parts with @xmath19 , the additional part is solved @xmath69 times with @xmath71 , and subsequently the acoustic parts are solved @xmath70 times with @xmath72 . if necessary",

    "\\nonumber \\\\ { } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a treatment of the additional parts is necessary , e.g. , when the surface - tension term exists .",
    "( the surface - tension part , represented by @xmath77 , should be solved together with the acoustic parts because the surface tension always needs to balance with the pressure jump at the interface . )",
    "some other forms of factorization adjusted for a governing system can be employed .",
    "we determine the fundamental time interval , @xmath19 , by    @xmath78 where the parameters are typically set to @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath70 is determined so that , e.g. , the following condition is satisfied :    @xmath81 where the spatial difference of sound speed is used as a criterion . if the surface - tension term exists , the stability condition needed to solve it @xcite ,    @xmath82    should be taken into consideration to determine @xmath70 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the densities of materials on different sides of the interface , and @xmath85 is the surface - tension coefficient .",
    "also , @xmath69 is determined based on the stability condition of a method for the viscous term or others .",
    "at the interfaces where the value or derivatives of physical quantities are in general discontinuous , the use of the conventional centered schemes ( [ eq14])([eq16 ] ) for updating the spatial derivatives is not suitable , providing less accurate results , as will be demonstrated below using a numerical example .",

    "@xcite , an interpolation or differencing across the phase boundary may not physically valid , and gives rise to serious numerical errors . in the following ,",

    "@xmath194 introduced above , we sometimes observed negative @xmath6 near the interfaces .",
    "in such a case , we adopted @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is set to @xmath228 ; the numerical results were insensitive to the magnitude of this parameter .",
    "this problem would be overcome by employing the oscillation - free variants of the cip @xcite .",
    "in this series of articles , we have proposed an improved unified solver for compressible and incompressible fluids involving free surfaces , based on the cip - cup method , by adapting several improvements and modifications .",
    "( the most significant one given here in part ii is the adaptation of the mts integration technique , which makes the determination of the time interval very flexible . )",
    "high accuracy and excellent robustness of the improved methods have been demonstrated by using examples of free - surface flows that contain both compressible and incompressible materials .",
    "the present methods , however , face the following challenges :      in part i of this series , we proposed five kinds of extrapolation functions used to solve the convection of the density .",
    "although a concrete discussion has not been provided in the present paper , we observed that the most accurate result for a different problem was achieved by a different extrapolation function .",
    "the optimization of the function based on some criterion is , therefore , sorely expected .",
    "although in the present study we have empirically determined the parameters for the mts integration , an automatic , optimized determination should be useful in a practical application .",
    "the optimal time interval for the acoustic parts might be determined by a criterion based on the compressibility of fluids .",
    "if , for example , materials can be considered to be almost completely incompressible , as has been well known previously , one can use a time interval of an infinite cfl number with respect to the sound speed , whereas when a compressible material exists , as has been demonstrated in this paper , one needs a time interval depending on the sound speed .",
    "this means that the maximum values of @xmath222 and @xmath156 sufficient for accurate computations are rightly dependent on the compressibility .",
