    "the spin transfer effect ( ste ) states that when the spin - polarized electrons flow from one ferromagnet ( fm ) layer into another fm layer with magnetization aligned by a relative angle , they may transfer transverse spin angular momenta to the local spins of the second fm layer , thereby exerting a torque on the magnetic moments that is usually coined as the spin transfer torque ( stt ) .",
    "this important phenomenon was predicted independently by berger and slonczeski @xcite in 1996 and soon confirmed by experiments . because the ste can be utilized to switch the magnetic state of the free fm layer in a magnetic tunneling junction ( mtj ) or a spin valve by applying an electrical current instead of a magnetic field",
    ", it may be even more useful in writing heads for magnetic random access memory ( mram ) or hard disk drivers than the conventional tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) and giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effects . in view of the potentially wide applications in nanospintronic devices ,",
    "a number of works on the ste have been done for different systems both theoretically and experimentally zhu , mu1,mu2,ioannis , z.z.sun , g.d , levy , j.a , z.li , k.xia , g.d2,s.zhang , m.d , k.ando .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum dot ( qd ) has received much attention in the past decades , and a lot of advances have been made in this particular field ( e.g. refs .",

    "interaction is usually not negligible , some interesting phenomena related to the so interactions , such as the bias - controllable intrinsic spin polarization in a qd @xcite and the interplay of fano and rashba effect @xcite , can be observed .",
    "almost twenty years ago , datta and das predicted a spin transistor based on the rashba so @xcite , showing that the so interactions may be important in the semiconductor spintronics .",
    "however , the effect of the rashba so interaction on the ste is still sparsely studied . in this paper",
    ", we shall take the fm - qd ( insulator , i)-fm aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring system as an example to investigate how both the so interaction and the magnetic flux affect the spin - dependent properties of the system by means of the nonequilibrium green function method .",
    "we have found that the magnitude and direction of the stt can be easily controlled by changing the gate voltage @xmath0 on the qd or the magnetic flux @xmath1 through the ring if both the so and electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions in the qd are considered , which might be useful in information storage .",

    "iii , the spin - dependent properties of stt in the system under interest are numerically investigated , and some discussions are presented . finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "the system under interest is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "two fm leads spreading along the @xmath2 axis are weakly coupled to an insulating ( i ) barrier and a semiconducting qd , forming an ab ring .",
    "the left ( l ) fm electrode with the magnetization along the @xmath2 axis is applied by a bias voltage @xmath3 , while the right ( r ) electrode with the magnetization along the @xmath4 axis that deviates by an angle @xmath5 from the @xmath2 axis is applied by a bias voltage @xmath6 .",
    "assume that the qd is made of a two - dimensional electron gas in which the electrons are strongly confined in the @xmath7 direction by a potential @xmath8 .",
    "due to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unit vector along the @xmath7 axis . if @xmath8 is asymmetric to @xmath13 , both rashba so and e - e interactions on the qd should be considered . since the electronic transport of the device along the @xmath2 axis is much more dominant than that along other two dimensions , the device under interest can be treated as a quasi one - dimensional system .",
    "et al_. @xcitehave carefully analyzed the so rashba interaction and found that ( i ) the rashba so interaction can be separated into two parts , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , namely @xmath16=h_{r_{1}}+h_{r_{2 } } , \\\\",

    ", we shall consider the case with a single - level qd as in some previous works @xcite , where no interlevel spin - flip scattering happens in the qd .",

    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the right fm layer gains two types of torques : one is the equilibrium torque caused by the spin - dependent potential , and another is from the tunneling of electrons that is in what we are interested .",
    "after cautiously separating the current - induced torque from the equilibrium one , the stt is given by @xmath58    from eq .",
    "( 9 ) , it is clear that the current - induced stt can be obtained as long as we get the lesser green functions @xmath59 .",
    "in what follows we shall use keldysh s nonequilibrium green function technique to determine all lesser green functions @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that when the incident electrical current is larger than a critical value , the stt can switch the direction of the magnetization of the free fm layer clockwise or anticlockwise depending on the direction of the incident electrical current @xcite . in the present case , the positive stt tends to push the spins in the right fm electrode aligning antiparallel with the magnetization of the left fm electrode , while the negative stt may cause a reverse orientation of the magnetization in the free fm layer . in order to properly incorporate the ste into a functionalized spintronic device",
    ", both the direction and magnitude of the stt should be taken into account .",

    ", the stt becomes positive ( clockwise ) .",
    "this fact reminds us that we may apply the magnetic flux to change the direction of the stt , thereby being capable of manipulating the magnetic state of the free fm layer , which might be useful for information storage and for designing the memory element . the electrical current @xmath88 decreases with increasing @xmath5 in the absence of either @xmath101 or @xmath85 , indicating a spin - valve effect , while it increases with @xmath5 in the presence of both @xmath1 and @xmath85 ( greater than @xmath102 ) , giving an anti - spin - valve effect [ e.g. @xmath1 or @xmath96 in figs .",
    "2(b ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "this property differs obviously from the conventional fm - i - fm or fm - qd - fm systems without considering the so interactions where the electrical current always decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",

    "we can see that with increasing @xmath1 , the stt , electrical current and spin current oscillate differently for various rashba so interactions @xmath85 .",
    "the larger the so interaction @xmath85 is , the more complex the oscillations are .",
    "for the qd energy level @xmath106 and @xmath96 , the stt shows a maximum around @xmath107 , while the electrical current exhibits minima around the same @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we may be able to use a lower current to change the magnetic state of the free fm by adjusting the magnetic flux penetrating into the ab ring .",
    "it is favorable for the spintronic devices , because a larger current may cause more heating , while the heating should be reduced as small as possible for better functions of the device .",

    "@xmath111 and @xmath89 have just opposite properties : the peaks at @xmath98 ( dips at @xmath114 ) for @xmath115 correspond to the dips ( peaks ) for @xmath116 at the same @xmath1 , but the curves for positive and negative @xmath38 intersect at @xmath113 , as shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( c ) .",
    "it hints us that by changing the gate voltage that is usually utilized to alter the energy levels @xmath38 in the qd , one can adjust the stt .",
    "for example , when @xmath98 , if we change @xmath117 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 , the stt changes from @xmath120 anticlockwise to @xmath121 clockwise .",
    "as the gate voltage is easier than the magnetic flux to control , the present observation may offer a useful way to manipulate the magnetic state of the free fm layer .",
    "the electrical current also displays quite different oscillating behaviors for @xmath115 and @xmath118 , which is shown in fig .",
    ".    why can the stt be controlled by changing the magnetic flux and gate voltage ? because the transmission probability of the spin - up electrons is proportional to @xmath122 and that of spin - down electrons is proportional to @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down electrons have different transmission probabilities if @xmath85 is nonzero , leading to oscillations of the stt with magnetic flux @xmath1 .",

    "since @xmath125 and @xmath127 oscillate for various combination of @xmath1 and @xmath85 in different ways , the stt may reach the maximum while @xmath88 is in its minimum when @xmath1 and @xmath85 take proper values .    , and @xmath109 .",

    "it is apprehensible , because owing to the rashba effect , the spin - up and spin - down electrons pass through the ab ring system at different transmission probabilities , as discussed above .",
    "when these spin - polarized electrons flow into the right fm layer , they may transfer some spin angular momenta to the local spins of the right fm electrode , thereby giving rise to the stt . in this case , if @xmath139 , the stt becomes negligibly small . in the above analysis",
