    "intuitively , it is implausible that @xmath90 followers can continuously identify the leader and its strategy can be adapted by them in the limit of very large @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for the revision of single leader picture is that the larger the market is , a more demanding and time consuming is the technical analysis of the follower that claims to localize socially attainable local leader .",
    "accordingly , we are interested in a more general multi - leader stationary society influenced by a varying group of irregularly distributed _ local leaders_.    this paper aims to suggest indirect method of generation of _ segmented market _ which includes many competing local leaders .",
    "the network is reconstructed indirectly via the knowledge extracted from the _ random walk process on the net _  @xcite .",

    "the fitness ranked by walker - informant allows to propose preferential attachments that are expected to yield formation of _ segmented market _ with impediments to the free flow of information .",

    "the extremal dynamics  @xcite when interpreted as a bankruptcy of firm or exit of strategy from market could be considered to be the principal mechanism of the economic _ co - evolution_. the idea of bak - sneppen model can be easily converted to strategic variables . in that case",
    "the least fit strategy developed by @xmath33 is replaced by a random candidate from certain limited strategic space .",
    "no reconnections are assumed within the procedure @xmath113 itself .",
    "this simplification is justified by the assumption that low fitness agents are rarely attached [ i.e. @xmath114 is relatively small ] .",
    "this reluctance against attachment follows from the preferences incorporated into @xmath89 .",
    "the extremal event in the present formulation means that instant value of the strategic variable is immediately replaced by gaussian distributed random number @xmath115 of dispersion @xmath116 .",
