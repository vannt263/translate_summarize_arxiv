    "thermoelectric materials , which interconvert temperature gradients and electric voltages , could play a key role for future energy production and utilization.@xcite while the conventional research and optimization of the thermoelectric materials have been done based on the one - electron band theory , transition - metal oxides with strong electron correlation have recently attracted much attention as promising candidates since the discovery of unusually large thermopower @xmath4 in na@xmath1coo@xmath5.@xcite one possible origin of the enhanced @xmath4 in the correlated metals is entropy flow of the correlated electrons,@xcite expressed as heikes formula.@xcite this mechanism could provide a novel strategy for designing the high - performance thermoelectric materials in a different way from the band - theory approach .",
    "however , the heikes formula is strictly correct only in the high - temperature limit,@xcite and its applicability at practical temperatures is highly nontrivial .",
    "it has been suggested by some groups that the large @xmath4 observed in na@xmath1coo@xmath5 can be explained within some band structure effects,@xcite and the applicability of the heikes formula to real materials is still under debate .    as derived by the boltzmann transport equation in the band theory ,",
    "conventional metals show the very small @xmath4 well below the fermi temperature @xmath6 k , because it is strongly reduced by the factor @xmath7 from the value @xmath8 @xmath9 . in the high - temperature limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the conducting state is treated as the incoherent hopping of localized charge carriers between the adjacent sites , and hence @xmath4 derived by the heikes formula becomes of the order of @xmath10 reflecting the entropy consideration . in materials with strong electron correlation , there exist two possible cases for the high - temperature regime ( @xmath11 ) : ( i ) @xmath12 or ( ii ) @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the half bandwidth , @xmath15 the on - site coulomb interaction . in the case of ( i ) @xmath12 , @xmath4 obtained from the heikes formula is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hole concentration , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) denotes the local degeneracy of the electronic configuration on the site without ( with ) hole carrier.@xcite in this temperature region , the spin and orbital degrees of freedom explicitly contribute to @xmath4 . for ( ii ) @xmath13 ,",
    "the carrier hopping occurs , allowing the doubly occupied states , and @xmath4 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the orbital degeneracy and the electron number per site , respectively.@xcite therefore , it is predicted that high - temperature @xmath4 in the correlated metals shows crossovers asymptotically approaching the large limit values @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , depending on the signs of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the temperature dependence of @xmath4 could be non - monotonic as accompanied by nontrivial sign changes , while the sign of @xmath4 in the conventional metals is determined by the sign of charge carrier .",
    "it is expected that by observing such crossovers of @xmath4 , the applicability of the heikes formula can be experimentally verified .    as a model system suitable for examining the heikes formula , we chose a canonical filling - control insulator - metal ( mott ) transition system la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2,@xcite where a metallic state with coherent charge transport realizes only at low temperatures and the incoherent charge transport appears above @xmath25 k centered around the critical doping level @xmath26 .",
    "thus , around @xmath26 , @xmath4 is anticipated to asymptotically approach the heikes - formula values with increasing temperature in a manner dependent on the doping level and the coulomb correlation . by measuring @xmath4 up to 1250 k and comparing to the results of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) for the hubbard model ,",
    "we have clarified the essential features of the correlation effect on the high - temperature @xmath4 and verified the applicability of the heikes formula to the real correlated electron systems .",
    "single - crystalline ( @xmath27 - 0.26 ) and polycrystalline ( @xmath27 - 0.80 ) samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 were prepared by a floating - zone method and solid state reaction , respectively , as described elsewhere.@xcite polarized reflectivity spectra in the temperature range of 10 - 800 k were measured on the single crystals between 0.01 and 6 ev .",
    "the reflectivity spectra between 5 and 40 ev were measured at room temperature with use of synchrotron radiation at uv - sor , institute for molecular science . for the kramers - kronig analysis ,",
    "the spectrum above 40 ev was extrapolated by @xmath28 function , while below 0.01 ev the hagen - rubens relation or the constant reflectivity was assumed depending on the ground - state nature ( metal or insulator ) .",
    "@xmath4 was measured using a conventional steady state technique , in a cryostat ( an electric furnace ) below ( above ) room temperature .",
    "a temperature gradient was generated by heating ( cooling ) one edge of the sample with a small resistive heater ( an air pump ) .",
    "the contribution of au ( pt ) wires for electrical contact was carefully subtracted .",
    "while @xmath17 in the obtained single crystals is limited up to 0.26 , @xmath4 shows the nearly identical temperature and doping dependence between the single - crystalline and polycrystalline samples as shown later , and thus we discuss the doping variation of @xmath4 mainly based on the results of the polycrystals prepared in a wider doping region .",
    "all the measurements above room temperature were performed in a flow of ar / h@xmath5 ( 93%/7% ) gas to prevent the oxidation and we confirmed that the sample degradation at elevated temperature was negligible for the thermally - repeated measurements .    for the dmft calculation in the single - band hubbard model , the iterated perturbation theory was used to solve the effective impurity problem .",
    "this solution is suitable for capturing general features of the correlation effects over a wide temperature .",
    "semi - circular density of states with the bandwidth of @xmath29 was imposed on the non - interacting part of hamiltonian .",

    "2(b ) and ( c ) , the low - energy ( @xmath38 ev ) optical conductivity spectra near @xmath26 tends to show a broadened feature with increasing temperature , indicating the incoherent charge dynamics ; for @xmath39 , the mid - ir peak evolves into the @xmath40-flat structure , accompanying the closing of the gap . also for @xmath41 , the sharp drude peak changes to the rather @xmath40-flat feature with increasing temperature .",

    "3 , we show the temperature variation of @xmath4 in la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 up to 1250 k. below @xmath42 , @xmath4 shows large positive values and decreases with increasing temperature , being typical of insulators or semiconductors . above @xmath43 , it shows linear @xmath44-dependence with a small slope , which represents the conventional metallic feature . on the other hand , non",
    "- monotonic temperature dependence is observed centered around @xmath26 ; the enhanced negative slope at low temperatures around @xmath26 indicates the correlated metallic state with the enhanced carrier mass on the verge of the mott transition,@xcite which has also been confirmed by the measurement of the electronic specific heat coefficient in this system.@xcite with increasing temperature , @xmath4 changes its sign at @xmath45 200 k , and then reaches a relatively large positive value ( @xmath46 @xmath47 ) at @xmath45 600 k. as described above , the results of the resistivity and the optical conductivity indicate that the incoherent transport appears above 200 k around @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the change to the large positive values can be interpreted as the crossover to the high - temperature regime where the heikes formula holds valid .     in la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , while @xmath4 is negative at low temperatures reflecting the sign of the charge carrier .",
    "the theoretical asymptotic values in the high - temperature limits show the @xmath17 dependence , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , which are obtained by applying the heikes formula to the la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 system . in the case of ( i ) @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath15 , the configurations are @xmath53 and @xmath54 for v@xmath55 ( 3@xmath56 ) and v@xmath57 ( 3@xmath58 ) ions , respectively , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) is expressed as @xmath59 here , we assumed that the crystal field splitting ( @xmath60 ) between the @xmath49 and @xmath50 states and the hunds - rule coupling energy ( @xmath61 ) are all comparable to or smaller than @xmath15 , but much larger than @xmath51 . for ( ii ) @xmath15 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath52 @xmath51 , on the other hand , inserting @xmath62 and @xmath63 into eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have @xmath64 around @xmath26 , the limit values @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive and negative , respectively .",
    "thus , the sign change at the characteristic temperature @xmath65 200 k is due to the crossover asymptotically approaching @xmath23 , where the charge transport changes from the coherent motion in the correlated metal to the carrier hopping as in a doped mott insulator . reflecting the doping variation of @xmath23 , to which the spin and orbital degrees of freedom explicitly contribute",
    ", the maximum value of @xmath4 in the intermediate temperature monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath17 up to @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . with further increasing temperature ,",
    "@xmath4 begins to decrease while approaching negative @xmath24 .",
    "this may correspond to another crossover to the incoherent metal state allowing the doubly occupied states .",
    "all these experimental results reveal that the energy scales @xmath51 ( @xmath67 and 120 mev ) as corresponding to two crossover temperatures appear still smaller than the anticipated @xmath14 and @xmath15 values .",
    "this should be considered not as discrepancy from the assumption in the derivation of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) , but as reflection of the high sensitivity of @xmath4 to the entropy transport .",
    "such an _ undershooting _ behavior of the @xmath4 crossovers is also partly reproduced in the simple dmft calculation ( _ vide infra _ ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath68 at @xmath69 @xmath70 , as a typical example .",
    "@xmath68 still shows nearly - constant negative values reflecting the sign of the charge carrier , while @xmath4 changes its sign from negative to positive .",
    "the contrasting behavior between @xmath4 and @xmath68 comes from the high sensitivity of @xmath4 to the entropy transport , and indeed ensures that the @xmath4 crossovers can not be explained by the change of the band structure around the fermi level .",
    "thus , comparison with a model calculation which may be simple but fully takes into account the correlation effects will be useful to capture the essence of the high - temperature @xmath4 .     and the hall coefficient @xmath68 at @xmath69 . ,",
    "width=257 ]    the remarkable variation of @xmath4 in the mott critical state , as typified by the sign changes of @xmath4 centered around @xmath26 , is shown using the selected experimental data set of fig .",
    "figures 6(b ) and ( c ) show results of the dmft calculation of @xmath4 with the doping rate @xmath17 and the ratio of @xmath71 , respectively . in this calculation , the energy gradient of density of states at fermi level is positive at @xmath72 , and thus @xmath4 at low temperatures is negative since @xmath73 is approximately proportional to the gradient . in the high - temperature limit , on the other hand , @xmath4 must asymptotically approach the limit values given by @xmath74 for the case ( i ) @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath15 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 for the case ( ii ) @xmath15 @xmath52 @xmath51 ( @xmath77 ) . for @xmath78 , as an example , the limit values @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive and negative , respectively , and thus @xmath4 should change its sign twice in the whole temperature region , as in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , @xmath4 at @xmath78 indeed shows the non - monotonic temperature dependence analogous to the experimentally observed one . with increasing @xmath17",
    ", @xmath23 decreases and finally changes the sign , while the absolute value @xmath79 increases monotonically .",
    "besides , the coulomb interaction becomes less effective for larger @xmath17 or in going away from the half - filling ; this explains the detailed @xmath17 dependence of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) . of course , except in the strong - correlation ( @xmath80 ) and high - temperature ( @xmath11 ) limits",
    ", @xmath4 is not in agreement with the limit values @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as shown in fig .",

    ", @xmath4 tends to directly approach @xmath24 ( @xmath83 @xmath47 ) , while the carrier mass enhancement , manifesting as a steep negative @xmath44-gradient at low temperatures , disappears .",
    "these theoretical results can reproduce the experimentally observed features for la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 , confirming that the effect of coulomb interaction is essential for the observed non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath4 .     in la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 for comparison with the theoretical results , ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "our systematic investigations on la@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2 thus show that in the incoherent transport region above @xmath84 k , @xmath4 measures the entropy per charge carrier in response to the magnitude relation between @xmath51 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( and @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , and thus shows the two essential crossovers , asymptotically approaching respectively the limit values @xmath23 and @xmath24 obtained from the heikes formulas . in the case of some metallic layered cobaltites including na@xmath1coo@xmath5 , typical thermoelectric materials with the strong electron correlation , the limit values have the same positive sign as the low - temperature one determined by the band structure , and thus it would be difficult to detect the @xmath4 crossovers .",
