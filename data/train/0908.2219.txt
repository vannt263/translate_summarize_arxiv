    ", @xcite , @xcite  @xcite . from this analysis",
    "it follows that in the general case the decay law @xmath16 takes the inverse power  like form @xmath44 , ( where @xmath45 ) , for suitably large @xmath46 .",
    "this effect is in agreement with the general result ( [ |a(t)|-as ] ) .",
    "effects of this type are sometimes called the `` khalfin effect '' @xcite .",
    "the problem of how to detect possible deviations from the exponential form of @xmath16 at the long time region has been attracting the attention of physicists since the first theoretical predictions of such an effect .",
    "@xcite many tests of the decay law performed some time ago did not indicate any deviations from the exponential form of @xmath16 at the long time region . nevertheless , conditions leading to the nonexponetial behavior of the amplitude @xmath18 at long times were studied theoretically @xcite  @xcite .",
    "conclusions following from these studies were applied successfully in an experiment described in the rothe paper @xcite , where the experimental evidence of deviations from the the exponential decay law at long times was reported .",
    "this result gives rise to another problem which now becomes important : if ( and how ) deviations from the exponential decay law at long times affect the energy of the unstable state and its decay rate at this time region .",
    "note that in fact the amplitude @xmath18 contains information about the decay law @xmath16 of the state @xmath19 , that is about the decay rate @xmath37 of this state , as well as the energy @xmath47 of the system in this state .",
    "this information can be extracted from @xmath18 . indeed , if @xmath19 is an unstable ( a quasi ",
    "stationary ) state then @xmath48 so , there is @xmath49 in the case of quasi  stationary states .",
    "the standard interpretation and understanding of the quantum theory and the related construction of our measuring devices are such that detecting the energy @xmath47 and decay rate @xmath37 one is sure that the amplitude @xmath18 has the form ( [ a - q - stat ] ) and thus that the relation ( [ e - ig ] ) occurs .",
    "taking the above into account one can define the `` effective hamiltonian '' , @xmath50 , for the one  dimensional subspace of states @xmath51 spanned by the normalized vector @xmath19 as follows ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath52 in general , @xmath50 can depend on time @xmath1 , @xmath53 .",
    "one meets this effective hamiltonian when one starts with the schrdinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) for the total state space @xmath10 and looks for the rigorous evolution equation for the distinguished subspace of states @xmath54 . in the case of one ",
    "dimensional @xmath51 this rigorous schrdinger  like evolution equation has the following form for the initial condition @xmath55 ( see , @xcite and references one finds therein ) ,    @xmath56    relations ( [ h ] ) and ( [ eq - for - h ] ) establish a direct connection between the amplitude @xmath18 for the state @xmath57 and the exact effective hamiltonian @xmath58 governing the time evolution in the one  dimensional subspace @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the use of the evolution equation ( [ eq - for - h ] ) or the relation ( [ h ] ) is one of the most effective tools for the accurate analysis of the early as well as the long  time properties of the energy and decay rate of a given quasi  stationary state @xmath60 .",
    "so let us assume that we know the amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "then starting with this @xmath18 and using the expression ( [ h ] ) one can calculate the effective hamiltonian @xmath58 in a general case for every @xmath1 .",
    "thus , one finds the following expressions for the energy and the decay rate of the system in the state @xmath19 under considerations , to be more precise for the instantaneous energy and the instantaneous decay rate , ( for details see : @xcite ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the real and imaginary parts of @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the deviations of the decay law @xmath34 from the exponential form can be described equivalently using time - dependent decay rate ( [ g(t ) ] ) . in terms of such @xmath65 the khalfin observation that @xmath16 must tend to zero as @xmath35 more slowly than any exponential function means that @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    using ( [ h ] ) and ( [ e(t ) ] ) , ( [ g(t ) ] ) one can find that @xmath69    the aim of this talk is to discuss the long time behaviour of @xmath70 using @xmath18 calculated for the given density @xmath23 .",
    "we show that @xmath71 as @xmath72 for the model considered and that a wide class of models has similar long time properties : @xmath73 .",
    "it seems that , in contrast to the standard khalfin effect @xcite , in the case of the quasi  stationary states belonging to the same class as excited atomic levels , these long time properties of the instantaneous energy @xmath74 have a chance to be detected , eg .",
    ", by analyzing the properties of the high energy cosmic rays or the spectra of very distant stars .",

    "from ( [ h - as ] ) it follows that @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 the property ( [ re - h - as ] ) means that @xmath95 for different states @xmath96 , ( @xmath97 ) one has @xmath98 whereas in general @xmath99 .",

    "to complete the analysis performed in the previous section let us consider a more general case of @xmath27 and @xmath18 .",
    "for a start , let us consider a relatively simple case when @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "let derivatives @xmath113 , ( @xmath114 ) , be continuous in @xmath115 , ( that is let for @xmath116 all @xmath113 be continuous and all the limits @xmath117 exist ) and let all these @xmath113 be absolutely integrable functions then ( see @xcite ) , @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "let us now consider a more complicated form of the density @xmath27 .",
    "namely let @xmath27 be of the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 and it is assumed that @xmath122 , ( @xmath123 ) , exist and they are continuous in @xmath124 , and limits @xmath125 exist , @xmath126 for all above mentioned @xmath127 and @xmath112 , then @xmath128 ,          \\label{a - eta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( compare @xcite ) @xmath129 @xmath130 is the gamma function and @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath134 for @xmath35 for the @xmath18 given by the relation ( [ a - omega ] ) looks as follows @xmath135    in the more general case of @xmath18 ( see , e.g. ( [ a - eta ] ) ) after some algebra the asymptotic approximation of @xmath18 can be written as follows @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are complex numbers .    from the relation ( [ a(t)-as - w ] ) one concludes that @xmath139    now let us take into account the relation ( [ eq - for - h ] ) . from this relation and relations ( [ a(t)-as - w ] ) , ( [ da(t)-as - w ] ) it follows that @xmath140 where @xmath141 are complex numbers with negative or positive real and imaginary parts .",
    "this means that in the case of the asymptotic approximation to @xmath18 of the form ( [ a(t)-as - w ] ) the following property holds , @xmath142    it seems to be important that results ( [ h - sim - w ] ) and ( [ lim - h ] ) coincide with the results ( [ h - as ] )  ( [ im - h1-h2-as ] ) obtained for the density @xmath80 given by the formula ( [ omega - bw ] ) .",
    "this means that general conclusion obtained for the other @xmath27 defining unstable states should be similar to those following from ( [ h - as ] )  ( [ im - h1-h2-as ] ) .",
    "long time properties of the survival probability @xmath143 and instantaneous energy @xmath74 are relatively easy to find analytically for times @xmath67 even in the general case as it was shown in previous section and @xcite .",
    "it is much more difficult to analyze these properties analytically in the transition time region where @xmath144 .",
    "it can be done numerically for given models .    the model considered in sec .",
    "2 and defined by the density @xmath80 , ( [ omega - bw ] ) , allows one to find numerically the decay curves and the instantaneous energy @xmath145 as a function of time @xmath1 .",
    "the results presented in this section have been obtained assuming for simplicity that the minimal energy @xmath3 appearing in the formula ( [ omega - bw ] ) is equal to zero , @xmath146 .",
    "so , all numerical calculations were performed for the density @xmath147 given by the following formula @xmath148 for some chosen @xmath149 . performing calculations particular attention",
    "was paid to the form of the probability @xmath143 , i. e. of the decay curve , and of the instantaneous energy @xmath145 for times @xmath1 belonging to the most interesting transition time - region between exponential and nonexponential parts of @xmath143 , where the following relation corresponding with ( [ a - exp = a - non ] ) and ( [ t - as-2 ] ) takes place , @xmath150 where @xmath151 are defined by ( [ a - exp+a - non ] ) .",
    "results are presented graphically below .                  a similar form of a decay curves one meets for a very large class of models defined by energy densities @xmath154 of the following type ( see @xcite ) , @xmath155 where @xmath156",
    ", @xmath157 is a form  factor  it is a smooth function going to zero as @xmath158 and it has no threshold and no pole . the asymptotical large time behavior of @xmath18 is due to the term @xmath159 and the choice of @xmath160 ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "the density @xmath154 defined by the relation ( [ omega - gen ] ) fulfills all physical requirements and it leads to the decay curves having a very similar form at transition times region to the decay curves presented above .",
    "the characteristic feature of all these decay curves is the presence of sharp and frequent oscillations at the transition times region ( see figs ( [ a10 - 1 ] ) , ( [ a10 - 2 ] ) , ( [ a100 - 1 ] ) , ( [ a100 - 2 ] ) , ( [ a100 - 3 ] ) ) .",
    "this means that derivatives of the amplitude @xmath18 may reach extremely large values for some times from the transition time region and the modulus of these derivatives is much larger than the modulus of @xmath18 , which is very small for these times .",
    "this explains why in this time region the real and imaginary parts of @xmath161 , which can be expressed by the relation ( [ h ] ) , ie . by a large derivative of @xmath18 divided by a very small @xmath18 ,",
    "reach values much larger than the energy @xmath47 of the the unstable state measured at times for which the decay curve has the exponential form .",
    "for the model considered we found that , eg . for @xmath152 and @xmath162 the maximal value of the instantaneous energy equals @xmath163 and @xmath74 reaches this value for @xmath164 and then the survival probability @xmath16 is of order @xmath165 .",
    "the question is whether and where this effect can manifest itself .",
    "there are two possibilities to observe the above long time properties of unstable states : the first one is that one should analyze properties of unstable states having not too long values of @xmath43 .",
    "the second one is finding a possibility to observe a suitably large number of events , i.e. unstable particles , created by the same source .",
    "the problem with understanding the properties of broad resonances in the scalar sector ( @xmath4 meson problem @xcite ) discussed in @xcite , where the hypothesis was formulated that this problem could be connected with properties of the decay amplitude in the transition time region , seems to be possible manifestations of this effect and this problem refers to the first possibility mentioned above .",
    "there is the problem with determining the mass of broad resonances .",
    "the measured range of possible mass of @xmath4 meson is very wide , 400  1200 mev .",
    "so one can not exclude the possibility that the masses of some @xmath4 mesons are measured for times of order their lifetime and some of them for times where their instantaneous energy @xmath166 is much larger .",
    "this is exactly the case presented in fig .",
    "( [ h10 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ h100 ] ) . for broad mesons",
    "the ratio @xmath167 is relatively small and thus the time @xmath43 when the above discussed effect occurs appears to be not too long .",
    "astrophysical and cosmological processes in which extremely huge numbers of unstable particles are created seem to be another possibility for the above discussed effect to become manifest . the probability @xmath168 that an unstable particle , say @xmath169 , survives up to time @xmath144 is extremely small .",
    "let @xmath16 be @xmath170 where @xmath171 , then there is a chance to observe some of particles @xmath169 survived at @xmath144 only if there is a source creating these particles in @xmath172 number such that @xmath173 so if a source exists that creates a flux containing @xmath174 unstable particles and @xmath175 then the probability theory states that the number @xmath176 unstable particles @xmath177 has to survive up to time @xmath144 .",
    "sources creating such numbers of unstable particles are known from cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the big bang is the obvious example of such a source .",
    "some other examples include processes taking place in galactic nuclei ( galactic cores ) and inside stars , etc .",
    "so let us assume that we have an astrophysical source creating a sufficiently large number of unstable particles in unit of time and emitting a flux of these particles and that this flux is constant or slowly varying in time .",
    "consider as an example a flux of neutrons . from ( [ t - as-3 ] )",
    "it follows that for the neutron @xmath178 , where @xmath179 [ s ] .",
    "if the energies of these neutrons are of order @xmath180 [ ev ] then during time @xmath181 they can reach a distance @xmath182 [ ly ] , that is the distance of about a half of the milky way radius . now if in a unit ot time a suitably large number of neutrons @xmath183 of the energies mentioned is created by this source then in the distance @xmath184 from the source a number of spherically symmetric space areas ( halos ) surrounding the source , where neutron instantaneous energies @xmath185 are much larger than their rest energy @xmath186 , ( @xmath187 is the neutron rest mass and @xmath188 denotes its velocity ) have to appear ( see fig .",
    "( [ circles - a ] ) ) .",
    "of course this conclusion holds also for other unstable particles @xmath189 produced by this source .",
    "every kind of particles @xmath189 has its own halos located at distances @xmath190 , @xmath191 from the source .",
    "radiuses @xmath190 of these halos are determined by the particles velocities @xmath192 and by times @xmath193 when instantaneous energies @xmath194 have local maxima .",
    "unstable particles @xmath189 forming these halos and having instantaneous energies @xmath195 have to interact gravitationally with objects outside of these halos as particles of masses @xmath196 .",
    "the possible observable effects depend on the astrophysical source of these particles considered .",
    "if the halos are formed by unstable particles emitted as a result of internal star processes then in the case of very young stars cosmic dust and gases should be attracted by these halos as a result of a gravity attraction .",
    "so , the halos should be a places where the dust and gases condensate .",
    "thus in the case of very young stars one may consider the halos as the places where planets are born .",
    "on the other hand in the case of much older stars a presence of halos should manifest itself in tiny changes of velocities and accelerations of object moving in the considered planetary star system relating to those calculated without taking into account of the halos presence .",
    "if the halos are formed by unstable particles emitted by a galaxy core and these particles are such that the ratio @xmath197 is suitably large inside the halos , then rotational velocities of stars rounding the galaxy center outside the halos should differ from those calculated without taking into account the halos . thus the halos may affect the form of rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "( of course , we do do not assume that the sole factor affecting the form of the rotation curves are these halos ) .",
    "another possible effect is that the velocities of particles crossing these galactic halos should slightly vary in time due to gravitational interactions , i. e. they should gain some acceleration .",
    "this should cause charged particles to emit electromagnetic radiation when they cross the halo .",
    "note that the above mentioned effects seems to be possible to examine .",
    "all these effect are the simple consequence of the fact that the instantaneous energy @xmath194 of unstable particles becomes large compared with @xmath198 and for some times even extremely large . on the other hand this property of @xmath194 results from the rigorous analysis of properties of the quantum mechanical survival probability @xmath18 ( see ( [ a(t ) ] ) ) and from the assumption that the energy spectrum is bounded from below .",

    "<S> taking into account results obtained for a model considered , it is hypothesized that this purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for the properties of broad resonances such as @xmath4 meson as well as having astrophysical and cosmological consequences . </S>"
