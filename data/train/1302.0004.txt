    "supersymmetry ( susy ) broken at the tev scale has long been considered the leading candidate for a solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the first two years of lhc data do not contain any hints of the traditional signals of susy  @xcite , pushing the superpartner mass scale to uncomfortably high values in the simplest implementations of the theory , too high to solve the hierarchy problem without introducing other tunings .",
    "the recent discovery  @xcite of the higgs boson at around 126 gev puts additional pressure on minimal susy : it is quite difficult to achieve such a heavy higgs mass within the simplest models without tuning  @xcite .",
    "if low - scale susy is nonetheless realized in nature , it is likely that one or more additional ingredients beyond the minimal version are present .",
    "there are several known ways to avoid the direct superpartner searches , including raising the mass of the first two generation squarks and the gluino  @xcite (  natural susy \" ) , a compressed or stealthy spectrum  @xcite , an r - symmetric theory with dirac gaugino masses  @xcite , and r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the higgs mass can be raised by extending the theory to the nmssm , possibly by making the higgs and the singlet composite  @xcite , or by strengthening the higgs quartic interaction by introducing additional gauge interactions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the scenario where the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) decays promptly via an r - parity violating ( rpv ) vertex , evading the bounds from direct superpartner searches .",
    "we then introduce an nmssm singlet to raise the higgs mass to the required 126 gev value .",
    "it has long been known that rpv  @xcite can significantly change the collider phenomenology of susy models without leading to excessive baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number violation ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is most easily accomplished in models where either b or l is conserved to a very good approximation , since the most stringent constraints on these couplings arise from the nonobservation of proton decay , which generally requires both b and l to be violated .",
    "the remaining couplings are subject to the relatively weaker constraints on processes which only violate b or l individually , and can be large enough to have a substantial impact on collider signatures . a particularly interesting possibility is when the lsp is a third generation ( stop or sbottom ) squark , decaying via the rpv operator @xmath0 as @xmath3 or @xmath4 , which is very difficult to disentangle from the vast amount of qcd background at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "one of the principle objections to rpv models is aesthetic in nature : one needs to introduce a large number of additional small parameters , which , while technically natural , is usually not very appealing .",
    "one possible simplifying assumption is to employ the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite . in mfv models the only sources of flavor violation are the sm yukawa couplings .",
    "if one applies this hypothesis  @xcite to the susy sm one obtains a robust prediction  @xcite for the baryon - number violating rpv couplings : they will be related to the ordinary yukawa couplings .",
    "thus the bnv couplings for third generation quarks will be the largest , while those involving only light generations will be very strongly suppressed .",
    "the resulting simple model evades most direct lhc bounds while preserving naturalness of the higgs mass , whereas the 126 gev higgs mass can be achieved by extending the model to the nmssm",
    ".    however , mfv is only a spurion counting prescription , rather than a full - blown effective theory .",
    "it does not fix the overall coefficients of the rpv terms , and does not even fix the relative coefficients of the baryon number violating ( bnv ) and lepton number violating ( lnv ) operators . moreover , it is not obvious a priori that a complete theory can be formulated that produces mfv susy as its low - energy effective theory and ensures that lnv operators are sufficiently suppressed to avoid proton decay .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a complete model that produces yukawa - suppressed rpv terms in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "since we want to explain the mfv structure of the entire effective lagrangian , we will have to incorporate a full - fledged theory of flavor into the model .",
    "we assume that the flavor hierarchy arises due to ( small ) mixing with heavy vectorlike quarks and leptons . upon integrating out these heavy fields",
    ", we obtain the sm flavor hierarchy as well as the yukawa suppressed rpv terms . to ensure that only the operators compatible with mfv",
    "are generated , we will gauge an su(3 ) subgroup of the su(3)@xmath5 spurious flavor symmetry of the standard model and impose a discrete symmetry to forbid other dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : blocks ] we first review how to obtain flavor hierarchies from mixing with heavy flavors .",
    "we then describe an anomaly - free gauged @xmath1 flavor symmetry which incorporates the heavy flavors , together with the flavor higgs sector needed to spontaneously break this symmetry and introduce the required mass mixings to generate the sm yukawa couplings . in section  [ sec : dangerouslnv ] we analyze all gauge - invariant operators that can lead to excessive baryon and lepton number violation , deriving experimental constraints on their couplings to determine which operators must be forbidden by a discrete symmetry . in section  [ sec : completemodel ] we present an anomaly - free discrete symmetry which forbids all problematic operators and describe the allowed flavor higgs potential , completing the model . in section  [ sec : susybreaking ]",
    "we consider the structure of the induced soft susy breaking terms and comment on the possibility that the third generation of heavy vector - like quarks could be within the range of the lhc .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , presenting the details of our choice of a suitable anomaly - free discrete symmetry in an appendix .",
    "the mfv susy scenario , outlined in  @xcite , is an r - parity violating variant of the mssm , with the superpotential @xmath6 and soft - terms with a minimal flavor - violationg ( mfv ) structure .",
    "the yukawa couplings , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , are holomorphic spurions charged under the @xmath10 flavor symmetry .",
    "unlike ordinary r - parity conserving mfv , mfv susy imposes relations between different _ superpotential _ couplings , and there is no rg mechanism for generating these relations , since the superpotential is not renormalized .",
    "thus , to explain the form of the superpotential beyond the level of a spurion analysis , it is necessary to embed mfv susy within a high - scale model which naturally generates this flavor structure .",
    "another reason that mfv susy requires a uv completion is that , while the superpotential  ( [ eq : mfvsusy ] ) is technically natural , it is not safe from planck - suppressed corrections .",
    "for instance , the operator @xmath11 may be generated by gravitational effects , whereas without an mfv structure this operator leads to rapid proton decay , as we show in section [ subsec : lnvconstraints ] . since",
    "global and/or spurious symmetries are generically broken by gravitational effects , to forbid this kind of operator we will ultimately require some additional gauge symmetry .",
    "one possibility would be to try to promote the entire ( semi - simple ) sm flavor symmetry @xmath12 to a gauge symmetry , with the yukawa couplings arising as vevs of superfields .",
    "however , in this case , the superpotential becomes nonrenormalizable , and in particular , the term @xmath13 requires @xmath14 to get a vev of the same order as the cutoff , due to the @xmath15 top yukawa coupling .",
    "the resulting effective field theory will necessarily have a low cutoff and will need its own uv completion .",
    "this suggests that we must introduce additional massive matter fields , which generate the yukawa couplings upon being integrated out .",
    "if the bnv couplings are generated along with the ordinary yukawa couplings upon integrating out the heavy fields then this explains their related structure .    as an example consider a quark sector consisting of the usual light quarks @xmath16 together with three pairs of vector - like right - handed up and down quarks @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 share the same sm quantum numbers as @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we assume the superpotential @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are flavor - universal parameters while @xmath26 and @xmath27 are in general @xmath28 mass matrices . for @xmath29 , the low - energy effective theory will contain small effective yukawa couplings for the chiral fields _ and _ an effective @xmath0 bnv operator due to the mixing between @xmath21 and @xmath19 and between @xmath22 and @xmath20 . at tree - level",
    ", one can integrate out the heavy fields using the @xmath30 and @xmath31 f - term conditions : @xmath32 leading to the mfv susy superpotential  ( [ eq : mfvsusy ] ) with @xmath33 and the yukawa couplings @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "this expression is readily understood by diagonalizing @xmath36 .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath37 of @xmath36 corresponds to the tangent of the corresponding mixing angle between the sm field @xmath21 or @xmath22 and the vectorlike partner @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 couple directly to the higgs with universal coupling @xmath24 , a small eigenvalue @xmath38 of @xmath36 corresponds to a small yukawa coupling @xmath39 , whereas a large eigenvalue @xmath40 of @xmath36 corresponds to a maximal yukawa coupling @xmath41 , with a smooth transition between the two behaviors around @xmath42 .",
    "we see that hierarchical yukawa couplings can arise if the mass matrices @xmath43 and/or @xmath2 have hierarchical eigenvalues , whereas @xmath44 is order one so long as the flavor universal couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also order one . while other choices are possible , for the remainder of this paper we will assume for simplicity that @xmath27 are flavor - universal parameters , so that all the flavor structure is generated by @xmath26 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the possibility of observable collider signatures , as it allows the vector - like third - generation partners to be relatively light , since the mass matrix for the vector - like generations takes the form : @xmath45^{-1 } \\,,\\ ] ] where the second equality follows in the case that @xmath46 is flavor - universal .",
    "if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 will generate only small yukawa couplings . in order to accommodate the @xmath49 top yukawa coupling , one eigenvalue of @xmath50 , which we denote @xmath51 , should be smaller than @xmath52 . in this case one",
    "integrates out the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the scale @xmath2 , and @xmath55 will remain in the spectrum with a yukawa coupling of order @xmath56 , as discussed above . the mass scales in  ( [ eq : quarkw ] ) implied by the observed yukawa couplings are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : topyukawa ] for the case @xmath57 .",
    "vs. @xmath2 for down - type ( left ) and up - type ( right ) quarks for @xmath58 . when @xmath59 the yukawa coupling will be unsuppressed , while all other yukawas are suppressed by a factor of @xmath60.[fig : topyukawa],width=288 ]    a similar construction for the lepton sector ( with sm fields denoted by @xmath61 ) has several possible variants , yielding somewhat different expressions for the neutrino masses .",
    "one possibility involves a set of three heavy vectorlike rh charged leptons @xmath62 and three rh neutrinos @xmath63 with the superpotential @xmath64 which after integrating out the heavy fields yields just the sm yukawa terms @xmath65 with @xmath9 given by  ( [ eq : effyukawa ] ) .",
    "another possibility is to instead introduce three heavy lepton doublets @xmath66 along with three rh neutrinos @xmath67 and the superpotential @xmath68 which gives rise to the effective superpotential : @xmath69 after integrating out the heavy fields , where now @xmath70    a third possibility , resulting in dirac neutrino masses , is to introduce light rh neutrinos @xmath67 together with vectorlike pairs or rh charged leptons @xmath62 and neutrinos @xmath71 .",
    "we then impose lepton number conservation , or ( more minimally ) a @xmath72 symmetry taking @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting model is closely analogous to the quark sector described above with the @xmath72 symmetry analogous to the @xmath72 center of @xmath76 ( but without an analogue for @xmath77 ) . due to this analogy , we omit further details .",
    "there are two important features of the quark superpotential  ( [ eq : quarkw ] ) which remain to be explained .",
    "firstly , we must explain why the couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 are flavor universal , as this is needed to obtain the mfv susy superpotential after integrating out the heavy fields .",
    "moreover , we must also explain the absence of other flavor universal couplings , such as @xmath0 and @xmath78 , which lead to unsuppressed baryon and/or lepton number violation .",
    "phrased differently , we have both a `` flavor problem '' ( explaining the flavor structure of certain couplings ) and a problem of accidental symmetries ( explaining the absence of certain couplings ) .",
    "these problems are related to but not synonymous with the usual problems of flavor and baryon / lepton number violation in the mssm .    in this subsection ,",
    "we focus on the first of these two problems , returning to the second issue later on .",
    "a crucial observation is that all the marginal couplings are flavor universal .",
    "this suggests the presence of a spontaneously broken flavor symmetry , where the nontrivial flavor structure of the mass terms descends from a marginal coupling to a flavor - higgs superfield .",
    "non - universal contributions to marginal couplings can still descend from non - renormalizable couplings to the flavor - higgs field , but these are suppressed by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the scale of flavor symmetry breaking and @xmath81 is the cutoff of the flavor - symmetric theory .    to avoid dangerous goldstone modes (  familons \" ) from the breaking of the flavor symmetry @xmath82",
    " and also to protect @xmath82 from gravitational effects  we choose to gauge it .",
    "we must therefore cancel the additional gauge anomalies @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "while the former anomaly can be canceled by introducing additional `` exotic '' hypercharged matter , such fields are hard to remove from the low - energy spectrum and also hard to eventually embed into a gut - like theory .",
    "we therefore wish to avoid introducing such exotic matter .",
    "it is surprisingly easy to achieve this if only a diagonal subgroup is gauged .",
    "a further benefit of introducing the minimum amount of additional gauge symmetries is the ability to write down a relatively simple yet suitable rich higgs potential for the flavor sector , as we explore in sections  [ sec : fcnc ] and  [ sec : completemodel ] .",
    "the simplest possibility is to gauge a diagonal @xmath85 for quark flavor and a diagonal @xmath86 for lepton flavor .",
    "once this is achieved , it is easy to take a single diagonal anomaly - free @xmath87 subgroup of the two to further simplify the model .",
    "examining the marginal couplings in  ( [ eq : quarkw ] ) , we conclude that @xmath88 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 transform under a common @xmath85 symmetry in the @xmath89{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}}}$ ] , @xmath90{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}}}$ ] and @xmath90{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}}}$ ] representations , respectively . if we also require the couplings @xmath27 to be flavor universal",
    ", then we conclude that @xmath91 and @xmath92 occupy conjugate representations , whereas @xmath92 and @xmath93 must occupy _ the same _ representation , otherwise @xmath94 would also be flavor universal . applying the same considerations in the lepton sector",
    "leads to the charge table       henceforward we make the simplifying assumption that the flavor higgs sector is completely vector - like , i.e.  that there exist fields @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc .",
    "such that the mass terms @xmath97 can appear in the superpotential .",
    "this implies that the flavor higgs sector makes no net contribution to the anomalies .",
    "discrete gauge symmetries are far less constrained than continuous gauge symmetries , since they lack cubic anomalies  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the only anomalies which must be cancelled for a discrete gauge symmetry are the @xmath98 and @xmath99 anomalies for all non - abelian gauge group factors @xmath82 ( precisely those anomalies which relate to gauge and gravitational instantons . )",
    "the cancelations of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 anomalies impose the constraints @xmath102 assuming that the flavor higgs sector is vector - like , the @xmath103 anomaly together with the previous conditions requires @xmath104 finally , cancellation of the @xmath99 anomaly together with the previous conditions naively requires @xmath105 where we now allow for an arbitrary number @xmath106 of nmssm singlets @xmath107 and ignore any contribution from other hidden sectors of the theory .",
    "such hidden sectors are inevitably present , however , as a truly complete theory will require a susy breaking sector , likely with r - charged gauginos , as well as a supergravity completion with an r - charged gravitino .",
    "thus , while we can solve  ( [ eq : gravanomaly ] ) by setting @xmath108 , the true anomaly constraint will depend on details of the hidden sector , and hence there is no clear constraint on @xmath106",
    ". it should be noted , however , that regardless of these details the true @xmath99 anomaly can usually be cancelled by an appropriate choice of @xmath106 .",
    "the anomaly constraints  ( [ eq : smanomaly ] ) and  ( [ eq : su3fanomaly ] ) have no analogous caveats , and must be satisfied if no additional sm charged or flavored fields are added to the model . a general solution to these constraints",
    "can be parametrized by @xmath109 for phase factors @xmath110 and an integer @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 and @xmath114 as a consequence of canceling the @xmath103 anomaly .",
    "we wish to forbid the problematic cross couplings between the flavor and electroweak higgs sectors  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) , ( [ eq : badew2 ] ) , which can lead to fine tuning of the electroweak scale .",
    "in particular , to forbid @xmath115 for @xmath116 we must require @xmath117 thus @xmath118 , and we require an r - symmetry .",
    "one can check that these conditions imply that the couplings  ( [ eq : badew2 ] ) are also forbidden , as are the remaining cross couplings in  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) involving only @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "suppose that @xmath121 is another flavor higgs singlet in the theory with charge @xmath122 and conjugate field @xmath123 . to forbid the cross couplings  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) between @xmath124 and the electroweak higgs sector ( in particular @xmath125 , ) we must require : @xmath126 there are analogous constraints on the charge @xmath127 of a flavor higgs tensor @xmath128 with conjugate field @xmath129 in order to forbid the cross couplings  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) as well as the @xmath63 tadpole  ( [ eq : badunivl ] ) . using @xmath130 and @xmath131",
    ", we obtain the constraints @xmath132 these constraints limit the allowed charges of the flavor higgs fields and hence the form of the higgs potential .",
    "we impose minimum consistency requirements on the flavor higgs potential : it must contain at least one @xmath133 and at least one @xmath134 operator ( or else the f - term conditions set the fields to zero ) and it must not have any accidental continuous symmetries . given these requirements , we now search for the smallest possible discrete r - symmetry which allows an acceptable higgs potential .    the lowest - order @xmath135 r - symmetries that do not contradict  ( [ eq : discrconstr ] ) are @xmath136 , where @xmath137 . for @xmath138 and @xmath139 one can check that the constraint  ( [ eq : phicons ] ) is so restrictive that @xmath140 necessarily , whereas @xmath141 and @xmath142 are forbidden by  ( [ eq : discrconstr ] ) . for @xmath143 , we can choose either @xmath144 or @xmath145 . in the former instance , we find that @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is a strict subset since the presence of all three variants will generate the @xmath148 tadpole . since @xmath149 , either @xmath150 or @xmath151 , but in either case neither @xmath133 nor @xmath134",
    "is permitted . for @xmath145 , we find @xmath152 , but to avoid all @xmath148 tadpoles as well as @xmath153 cross - couplings , we can have at most one additional variant of @xmath128 beyond @xmath154 , whereas no such pairing allows both @xmath133 and @xmath134 interactions .",
    "the next lowest order possibility is @xmath155 , which we will show to be sufficient .",
    "we choose @xmath156 so that @xmath157 .",
    "the above constraints dictate : @xmath158 however , one can show that to forbid all of the cross couplings  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) and the @xmath148 tadpole we must have @xmath159 , @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "no @xmath133 or @xmath134 interactions are possible in the latter two cases , so we consider the first case .",
    "the possible cubic interactions are : @xmath162 since @xmath163 , all three @xmath128 variants must be present to generate both @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we also have @xmath164 since @xmath165 and @xmath166 these variants are always present , and one can show that the higgs potential has an accidental @xmath167 symmetry unless @xmath168 as well .",
    "the @xmath169 variants are not necessary , but neither are they problematic .",
    "we will assume that they are absent for simplicity .",
    "assuming @xmath170 and @xmath171 , one can show that the flavor higgs potential is free of accidental @xmath172 symmetries , and that all of the cross couplings  ( [ eq : badew1 ] ) and all @xmath148 tadpoles are forbidden , as is @xmath173 .",
    "because we have assumed a @xmath174 discrete symmetry , we must set @xmath175 in  ( [ eq : anomparams ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath176 and so @xmath177 . we must also require @xmath178 .",

    "<S> we present a complete model whose low energy effective theory is the r - parity violating nmssm with a baryon number violating @xmath0 vertex of the mfv susy form , leading to prompt lsp decay and evading the ever stronger lhc bounds on low - scale r - parity conserving supersymmetry . mfv flavor structure is enforced by gauging an @xmath1 flavor symmetry at high energies . after the flavor group is spontaneously broken , mass mixing between the standard model fields and heavy vector - like quarks and leptons induces hierarchical yukawa couplings which depend on the mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> the same mechanism generates the @xmath0 coupling , explaining its shared structure . </S>",
    "<S> a discrete r - symmetry is imposed which forbids all other dangerous lepton and baryon - number violating operators ( including planck - suppressed operators ) and simultaneously solves the @xmath2 problem . </S>",
    "<S> while flavor constraints require the flavor gauge bosons to be outside of the reach of the lhc , the vector - like top partners could lie below 1 tev .    </S>",
