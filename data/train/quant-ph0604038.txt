    "a measurement is by definition an operation that acts on a system and returns some classical information , i.e. a label `` @xmath4 '' identified by an index @xmath5 . this operation typically , but not always , changes the state of the measured system ( _ wave - function collapse _",
    "mechanism ) . when measuring classical objects , the state change is only due to the change in the information we have on the system : the uncertainty in the state is usually reduced .",
    "when measuring quantum objects , the state change can have a dynamical nature that perturbs the system . the rigorous description of these mechanisms results from the kraus decomposition of the measurement apparatus  @xcite , which identifies the completely positive ( cp ) map of its evolution .",
    "when the system is initially in a state @xmath6 , the @xmath5th measurement outcome occurs with a probability @xmath7tr@xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the apparatus povm ( positive operator - valued measure ) , a set of positive operators normalized so that @xmath10 . after the outcome @xmath4",
    "is obtained , the state is changed to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a set of indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the apparatus kraus operators .",
    "the povm in terms of these is given by @xmath15 .",
    "on the basis of the above description of the measurement , we can define the following information and disturbance measures .    _ information : _ the outcome @xmath4 provides the experimenter with some information @xmath2 .",
    "we are , obviously , interested in the case in which @xmath4 provides some information on the measured system , and it is not just independently generated by the apparatus .",
    "thus , a good measure for @xmath2 is the mutual information between the measurement results and some property of the system state .",
    "a significant ( basis - independent ) property is the spectrum of the state @xmath6 , i.e. the probability distribution of its eigenvalues @xmath16 .",
    "of course , the ensemble composed by the eigenvectors of @xmath6 weighted by the corresponding eigenvalues is not the only one that originates from the state @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that it is the one that allows to recover the maximal accessible information ( it saturates the holevo bound )  @xcite .",
    "it is thus the appropriate choice since we ultimately want to bound the information from above .",
    "we then use @xmath17 the mutual information between the label @xmath18 identifying the eigenvalue of @xmath6 and the label @xmath5 identifying the measurement result : @xmath2 is the number of bits that the experimenter gains from the result @xmath4 on which eigenvector of @xmath6 the system was in ( before the measurement ) .",
    "it is maximal when all eigenvalues are equal ( the experimenter has no prior info on the state ) , and it is null when the state is pure ( the experimenter already has total knowledge of the state , and can not gain any more information on it ) . [ note that @xmath6 here refers to the state from the experimenter s point of view : it reflects his prior knowledge of the system state , i.e. that each eigenvector has a prior probability @xmath16 .",
    "the ` true ' state ( i.e. from the point of view of who is preparing the system ) will be in general purer . the knowledge that can be acquired by the experimenter is upper bounded by the difference in entropy between these two representations of the state . ]",
    "if the hilbert space of the system has finite dimension @xmath19 , we can normalize @xmath2 by dividing it with its maximum value @xmath20 , so to have @xmath21 .",
    "_ disturbance : _ a disturbance is an irreversible change in the state of the system , caused by a cp - map evolution ( such as the dynamical disturbance caused by quantum correlations that leak out to the environment and are lost ) .",
    "thus , any quantity @xmath0 that measures disturbance should satisfy the following requirements , inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite :    * @xmath0 should be a function only of the input state @xmath6 and of the apparatus , identified through its kraus operators @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "* @xmath0 should be null if and only if the transformation @xmath22 is invertible on @xmath6   is a purification of @xmath6 , there exists an `` inversion '' cp - map identified by the kraus operators @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , where the identity @xmath26 acts on the purification space . ] . in this case",
    "the state change can be undone , and such transformation is not disturbing the system .",
    "* once the state has been disturbed , it should not be possible to decrease @xmath0 with any successive transformation .",
    "this means that @xmath0 should be monotonically non - decreasing for successive applications of cp - maps  @xcite ( i.e. it should satisfy a sort of pipeline inequality ) .",
    "this requirement captures the notion that a disturbance should be irreversible , and is connected with the concept of `` cleanness ''  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath0 should be continuous : maps and input states which do not differ too much should give similar values of @xmath0 .",
    "the above requirements , which define the disturbance axiomatically , have nothing to do with the information the measurement provides . as such",
    ", there is no obvious _ a priori _ reason why an information  disturbance tradeoff should hold .",
    "definitions of disturbance are customarily based on the fidelity or the bures distance  @xcite between input and output states .",
    "even though valid information  disturbance relations can be found  @xcite , these definitions do not seem to appropriately gauge the disturbance , intended as an irreversible evolution .",
    "in fact , even though a unitary transformation is perfectly reversible , it can rotate a state to an orthogonal configuration , generating the maximum possible fidelity - based disturbance .",
    "these quantities do not satisfy the requirements _ ii ) _ and  _ iii)_. analogous considerations apply also if we use the entanglement fidelity  @xcite in place of the fidelity  , where @xmath27 is the fidelity , @xmath6 and @xmath28 are the input and output states , and the maximization runs over all unitaries @xmath29 .",
    "also this definition is inadequate , since @xmath30 is null if @xmath6 and @xmath28 have the same eigenvalues , which does not necessarily entail that the transformation is invertible , i.e. requirement _ ii ) _ still does not hold . ] .",
    "a definition of disturbance @xmath0 that satisfies all the above requirements can be found by recalling that a cp - map @xmath31 is invertible if and only if  @xcite the map s coherent information @xmath32 is equal to the von neumann entropy @xmath33tr@xmath34 $ ] of the input state @xmath6 .",
    "the coherent information  @xcite is defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a purification of @xmath6 and the map @xmath37 acts with @xmath31 on the system space and with the identity @xmath26 on the purification space .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is non - increasing for application of cp - maps ( data - processing inequality )  @xcite .",
    "namely , for any two maps @xmath31 and @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes composition of maps .",
    "thus , a disturbance measure that satisfies requirements  _ ii)-iii ) _ must be a function @xmath42 of @xmath43 , with @xmath42 non - decreasing and null when its argument is : @xmath44 .",
    "we then define @xmath45 which , in addition to  _",
    "ii)-iii ) _ , also satisfies requirements   _ i ) _ and  _ iv ) _ since it is continuous ( see the appendix ) .",
    "analogously to @xmath2 , also @xmath0 can be normalized in @xmath19-dimensional hilbert spaces by dividing it by @xmath20 , so that @xmath46 .    from the postulates of quantum mechanics",
    "it follows that the system state @xmath6 describes the information the experimenter possesses on the system .",
    "hence , there are two mechanisms that lead to a state change : the system dynamics and the acquisition of new information .",
    "heisenberg , in his uncertainty principle , was considering the former mechanism only . to exemplify the latter ,",
    "suppose i acquire a qubit in an unknown state .",
    "initially , i will assign to it the state @xmath47 , but as soon as the preparer tells me that the qubit was in the state @xmath48 , from my point of view it undergoes a state change ( even though i may have not interacted with it ) described by the map @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "we can call this a `` purely informational '' state change .",
    "since both the dynamical and the informational state changes are described by cp - maps , they both fall in the general framework described above .",
    "[ in this sense it may be interpreted as a generalization of heisenberg s intuition ] . is it possible to weight the contribution of these two mechanisms in each measurement apparatus ? yes : since the set of cp - maps is a convex set , the apparatus cp - map @xmath31 ( identified by the kraus operators @xmath22 ) can always be written as a convex combination of the purely informational map @xmath50 and of a `` dynamical '' map @xmath51 as @xmath52 \\labell{sdas}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kraus operators of the map @xmath50 are @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the ` true ' ( i.e. from the point of view of the preparer ) state @xmath48 : the action of @xmath50 must not change the true state , @xmath56=\\rho_p$ ] .",
    "[ note that in the case of a degenerate state @xmath48 , the map @xmath57 might not be univocally defined ] .",
    "the povm of a purely informational measurement is then @xmath58 ( the projectors on the eigenspaces of @xmath48 ) . in this respect ,",
    "the _ truly quantum _ contribution to the disturbance in a measurement is related to the map @xmath51 : it is present in those measurement apparatuses with @xmath59 .",
    "we now prove the information  disturbance tradeoff @xmath60 any measurement apparatus can be decomposed into a unitary evolution @xmath61 ( the stinespring dilation of the apparatus ) followed by a von neumann projective measurement on a probe p , the so - called _ indirect measurement model _",
    "@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ f : imm ] .",
    "the unitary @xmath61 couples q with the probe p in the apparatus yielding q@xmath62 and p@xmath62",
    ". the joint evolution of probe and system pq in the apparatus can be seen as composed by two complementary quantum channels : a channel q@xmath63p@xmath62 that describes the transfer of information from the system to the state of the probe in p@xmath62 which is then measured yielding the measurement result @xmath4 , and a channel q@xmath63q@xmath62 that evolves the system before the measurement into the system after the measurement conditioned on its result @xmath4 .",

    "( [ ppp2 ] ) , is achieved if and only if the states @xmath91 have support on orthogonal subspaces  @xcite ( which implies that they commute ) .",
    "thus , we have equality @xmath3 if and only if the channel @xmath78 maps different eigenvectors @xmath75 of the initial state @xmath6 into orthogonal subspaces .",
