    "it has long been thought that t hooft s @xmath3 limit @xcite of @xmath4 gauge theory might be usefully described by some sort of string theory .",
    "however , there is an apparently devastating argument , that this `` qcd string '' ( a.k.a . a tower of glueballs ) is _ not _ fundamental string ( of `` string theory '' ) : the graviton appears in the spectrum of the latter , contradicting the well - known folk theorem @xcite forbidding massless spin 2 bound states in a poincar invariant quantum field theory .",
    "a way to evade this argument has been shown by the conjectured equivalence between classical iib superstring theory on an ads@xmath5 background and @xmath6 supersymmetric @xmath7 yang - mills on flat 4 dimensional minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "the point is that in this example the graviton lives in 5 space - time dimensions and the flat space - time global symmetry ( poincar(3,1 ) ) is only a subgroup of poincar(4,1 ) , which is realized locally , not globally .",
    "thus the `` massless '' 5 dimensional graviton is a composite of the quanta of a flat - space quantum field theory in 4 dimensional space - time .",
    "there is no massless spin 2 particle in this 4d quantum field theory and no folk theorems are violated . in the @xmath6 conformally invariant example , the projection of the 5d graviton onto the 4d minkowski boundary of ads@xmath5 is a multi - gluon continuum state .",
    "but if the mechanism can be extended to the non - conformally invariant gauge theory describing the gluon sector of qcd , the graviton 4d remnant would presumably be a massive spin 2 glueball .    to move these statements beyond conjecture ,",
    "one clearly needs to establish the `` dual '' description starting from either of the supposedly equivalent theories .",
    "i think it is clear that the best starting point for such a project is the flat space quantum field theory .",
    "unlike the previous conjectured dualities in string theory , which asserted the equivalence of pairs of poorly defined theories , this duality asserts the equivalence of a poorly defined theory ( string or quantum gravity ) to a perfectly well defined theory ( asymptotically free or conformally invariant quantum gauge theory on flat 4d space - time ) .",
    "indeed , i am inclined to regard this `` duality '' as more analogous to the alternate descriptions of superconductivity given by bcs theory on the one - hand and landau - ginzburg theory on the other .",
    "if this metaphor holds , the flat space quantum field theory should be embraced as the long sought microscopic formulation of string / quantum gravity .",
    "as t hooft showed in his pioneering paper @xcite , the @xmath3 limit of @xmath4 yang - mills theory reduces to a certain sum of planar feynman diagrams .",
    "elegant techniques , involving the explicit elimination of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the matrix field , have been used to obtain this limit in matrix theories of extremely low space - time dimension ( namely d=0,1 ) @xcite , but these methods have failed to deal with theories with space - time dimension @xmath8 . at the moment ,",
    "i see no better approach to the @xmath8 case than setting up a framework to carry out the direct summation of planar graphs . in the mid-1970 s , motivated by the success of light - cone quantization of string theory @xcite , i proposed @xcite that planar diagram sums be carried out by using light - cone parameterization @xmath9 and that a convenient way to digitize the sum was to discretize the momentum conjugate to @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and imaginary light - cone time @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . in those first papers i restricted attention to scalar field theories , but brower , giles , and",
    "i soon made a first attempt to extend the approach to qcd @xcite . in our setup , the strong t hooft coupling limit @xmath15 favors the fishnet @xcite diagrams that lead to a light - cone string interpretation .",
    "of course , by its very nature a strong coupling limit probes the microscopic details of discretization , and can at best show only rough qualitative resemblance to the continuum theory .",
    "even so , there were a number of loose ends and unsatisfactory features of this first discretization of qcd which needed to be addressed .",
    "motivated by the goal of discovering a more definitive string description of large @xmath0 qcd klaus bering , joel rozowsky , and i set out to remedy these shortcomings , and in this talk i would like to tell you about the results of our efforts @xcite . as you will see",
    ", we have obtained a much improved discretization setup , but have just begun to explore its usefulness in capturing a string picture of the sum of planar diagrams .",
    "an evolving string sweeps out a world sheet @xmath16 in space - time .",
    "one can choose the parameters so that @xmath17 , and so that @xmath18 , the density of @xmath1 , is a constant @xmath19",
    ". then evolution in @xmath2 is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for brevity we have called @xmath21 and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "of course @xmath23 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath24 .",
    "a key novelty here is that @xmath25 measures the quantity of string present , and its interpretation as a component of momentum is secondary and derivative . in this way",
    "the string is seen to enjoy a galilei invariant dynamics as it moves only in the @xmath26 dimensional transverse space .    as shown by mandelstam @xcite ,",
    "interactions are easily introduced by using the path history form of quantum mechanics and including histories in which strings break and join .",
    "technically this is accomplished by first obtaining the imaginary time @xmath27 path integral representation of @xmath28 for free string .",
    "the action in this case is just @xmath29.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the action is seen to be an integral over a simply connected rectangular domain for an open free string and a cylinder for a closed string .",
    "a diagram describing an arbitrary number of splits and joins is obtained by allowing some number of cuts , each at constant @xmath22 but of varying length , within the domain . the ends of these cuts mark the splitting or joining points , and @xmath30 is discontinuous across them . calling the generic such domain @xmath31 , the complete amplitude is then given by @xmath32",
    "in order to give a nonperturbative definition of the path integrals appearing in the previous section , roscoe giles and i introduced a lattice version @xcite of the domains @xmath31 .",
    "it was only necessary to discretize @xmath33 and @xmath22 .",
    "so we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 fixed positive integers .",
    "then @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath39 , and the functional integration by ordinary integrals . finally , the action is simply replaced by @xmath40 where @xmath41 labels a link on the lattice .",
    "links between nearest neighbor sites in the @xmath33 direction are all present , but those in the @xmath22 direction are occasionally absent reflecting the possibility of splits and joins .",
    "it is a highly nontrivial fact that this apparently noncovariant setup turns out , after the continuum limit , to be fully compatible with poincar invariance in the critical dimension .",
    "to understand how feynman diagrams look in light - cone parameterization , consider the mixed representation of the scalar field propagator : @xmath42 for simplicity we may establish the convention that each line propagates forward in @xmath2 , and correspondingly @xmath43 .",
    "also we may pass to imaginary time , @xmath44 and then write @xmath45 where the second form is in transverse coordinate representation and @xmath46 is the dimensionality of transverse space .",
    "discretizing @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the coordinate propagator becomes provides a universal ultraviolet cutoff , and every diagram will therefore be finite .",
    "in contrast , the dlcq industry @xcite keeps time continuous , and must regulate ultraviolet divergences in some other fashion . ]",
    "@xmath50 comparing to the previous section , we see that we can crudely think of a planar feynman diagram as a ( coarsely ) discretized world sheet , with a dynamical link dependent string tension @xmath51 .",
    "each link has its own independent @xmath52 which are each summed over all positive integers .",
    "of course only the large fishnet diagrams will bear any actual resemblance to a continuous world sheet !",
    "the sum over all planar diagrams would then define the qcd string dynamics as including an average over all such discretizations ranging from coarse to fine .",
    "also note that a good world sheet path integral should have ( effectively ) only positive weights .",
    "for instance , for @xmath53 theory each vertex contributes a minus sign if @xmath54 .",
    "a good world sheet interpretation requires @xmath55 , the attractive unstable sign .",
    "gauge theories have vertices of both signs , complicating a straightforward world sheet interpretation .    to illustrate the effect of our discretization on a standard diagrammatic calculation , consider the sum of those 2 to 2 scattering diagrams in @xmath53 theory shown in fig .",
    "[ twototwo ] .",
    "we work in the transverse center of mass frame .",
    "assume that the ( discrete ) @xmath56 of the initial ( final ) particles is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "let @xmath59 be the initial energy ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "fix the discrete time of the first vertex at @xmath61 , and sum over all diagrams in which the final particles both propagate to time @xmath62 , multiply by @xmath63 and sum over all @xmath62 from 1 to @xmath64 .",
    "the result for the off - energy shell s - matrix is then @xmath65 compared to standard formal scattering theory , we see that instead of a factor @xmath66 which acts in wavepackets like the standard energy conserving delta function , the use of discrete time has rendered this as @xmath67 .",
    "this replacement is easy to understand because with discrete imaginary time , the amplitudes should be periodic in @xmath68 with period @xmath69 .",
    "it is thus apparent that the scattering amplitude should be identified with the coefficient of this factor . for @xmath55",
    ", the scattering amplitude shows a bound state pole at a real negative value of @xmath68 : @xmath70.\\ ] ] in the continuum limit , @xmath71 , one can make the pole location stay finite by tuning @xmath72 to vanish logarithmically as @xmath73 , showing dimensional transmutation in an asymptotically free theory .",
    "the discretization of qcd initially attempted by brower , giles , and me @xcite , was based on a literal transcription of the feynman rules in light - cone gauge .",
    "the transverse gauge field can be described in the complex basis @xmath74 when it takes on the guise of a complex scalar field , described diagrammatically by attaching an arrow to each line of a feynman diagram .",
    "the primitive quartic vertex conserves arrows , but the cubic vertices can act as sources or sinks of arrows .",
    "the longitudinal gauge field @xmath75 does not propagate and can be integrated out to yield an induced quartic vertex , which depends upon the @xmath1 values of the incoming legs in a singular way : @xmath76 upon discretization , we adopted the drastic prescription of simply dropping the infinite contribution at @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore all tadpole diagrams had to be dropped , because of our insistence that no line propagate 0 time steps .",
    "then the strong coupling limit singled out large planar diagrams involving only the primitive quartic couplings , thus leading to an evaluation similar to the @xmath78 example of the previous section .",
    "unfortunately , these quartic couplings have mixed signs : an attractive interaction between gluons of parallel spin and repulsive between gluons of antiparallel spin .",
    "this ferromagnetic interaction pattern meant that our discretization led to a formal strong coupling limit in which the only long string that could form in the limit would have huge total spin .",
    "the essential problem is that attractive interactions between gluons of opposite spin arise in qcd from gluon exchange @xcite , and the discretization chosen in @xcite prevents anti - ferromagnetic gluon exchange from competing at strong coupling with the ferromagnetic quartic interaction .",
    "this , together with our drastic prescription for all of the @xmath79 ills of light - cone quantization , points to the need for a more refined discretized model to adequately describe the strong coupling behavior of large @xmath0 qcd .",
    "clearly what is needed is a prescription that either enhances strong coupling gluon exchange or suppresses the strong coupling quartic interactions .",
    "we found it most natural to arrange the latter by abolishing all quartic interactions , primitive and induced , and replacing them with the exchange of short lived fictitious particles .",
    "this is shown for the primitive quartic interaction in fig.[4vertexto3vertex ] .",
    "the dashed line is associated with the fictitious two - form propagator @xmath80 where the @xmath81 are tunable parameters which are required to vanish rapidly with @xmath82 , the number of time steps propagated .",
    "we treat the induced quartic interaction in a similar fashion , giving the non - dynamical field @xmath75 a short - time propagator @xmath83 the presence of the tunable parameters @xmath84 and @xmath81 is very welcome , because they can be adjusted to arrange the cancelation of cut - off artifacts that can typically spoil poincar invariance in the continuum limit . as a bonus",
    ", we find that our prescription provides the appealing interpretation of tadpole diagrams indicated in fig .",
    "[ tadpole2 ] .",
    "the first two diagrams cancel exactly ( which is fortunate since they ca nt be drawn in our discrete model ! ) leaving the third diagram which _ can _ be drawn .",
    "our complete set of feynman rules is neatly summarized in fig .",
    "[ newrules ] taken from our paper @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that to avoid clutter we have suppressed the double line notation so these rules are completely sufficient for all graphs of planar or cylindrical topology ( @xmath3 ) . for general diagrams , the double line notation must be restored in order to properly account for the @xmath85 corrections .",
    "an easy way to understand why a set of rules with only cubic vertices is possible , is to apply light - cone gauge to the yang - mills lagrangian in first order form .",
    "the upshot is the lagrangian @xmath86\\nonumber\\\\ & & -ig\\tr{1\\over\\partial_-}{\\hat a}[a_k,\\partial_-a_k ] -ig\\tr\\phi_{kn}[a_k , a_n],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 .",
    "this makes it clear why we called the fictitious scalar represented by the dashed lines a 2-form : it is a ( pseudo ) scalar only in 3 + 1 dimensions .      quite apart from its use as a facilitator for a strong coupling expansion",
    ", our discretization can also serve as a novel way to regulate the diagrams of weak coupling perturbation theory . to illustrate this aspect",
    ", we quote the result for the one loop gluon self - energy , with discretization in place : @xmath88-{(m-1)(11m-1)\\over3 m } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty u^k\\sum_{l=1}^{m-1}{lh_k(l)\\over mk } -\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty f_k{u^k\\over k } \\left(4m[\\psi(m)+\\gamma]-{7(m-1)\\over2}\\right ) \\bigg ] , \\label{pi2new}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 . in order to cancel lattice artifacts in the continuum limit @xmath90 ,",
    "we find the constraints @xmath91 then we obtain @xmath92\\ln{q^2\\over2mt_0}+{4\\over3 } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath93 functions as a uv cut - off . with this understanding",
    "our result for @xmath94 agrees exactly with the known light - cone gauge result @xcite .",
    "notice that the parameters @xmath95 which specify our discretization enter weak coupling physics only through their _ moments _ , for example @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast , the strong coupling limit is sensitive to the values of these parameters at low @xmath62",
    ". thus the two limits give complementary constraints on these parameters .",
    "our main aim in developing this discretization formalism is to establish a framework for handling the sum of all the planar diagrams of @xmath3 gauge theories .",
    "as yet we do nt have any dramatic results to report .",
    "however we have begun studying how the machinery works in simpler situations than full - blown gauge theories . in our paper",
    "@xcite we worked out the sum of the densest ( strong coupling `` fishnet '' ) planar diagrams of @xmath97 scalar field theory .",
    "as expected the result leads to the light - cone quantized bosonic string ( with all of its usual pathologies , including the tachyon ) .",
    "the presence of tachyons is not particularly surprising , since the energy density of the theory is unbounded below .",
    "we have not made analogous progress on the corresponding diagrams of gauge theories .",
    "but we have studied the latter theory in the sectors with @xmath98 .",
    "this is not particularly difficult , since the limitation on @xmath36 reduces the sum of all possible diagrams to a geometric series . nevertheless , it is interesting , for example , that the @xmath98 gluon propagator summed to all orders in perturbation theory displays no additional poles beyond that of the massless gluon itself .",
    "in contrast the @xmath98 propagator for the fictitious 2-form field shows a bound state pole at sufficiently strong coupling @xmath99 .",
    "this indicates that the 2-form field may be particularly important for the understanding of the strong coupling limit .",
    "another relatively simple testing ground for our formalism is quantum field theory in low space - time dimensions , the simplest being the t hooft model ( qcd in one space and one time dimensions ) .",
    "rozowsky and i are just finishing up a study of this model .",
    "since this model is well understood even in the continuum limit , we used it mainly as a test of how our model approaches the continuum theory .",
    "one interesting feature of our simultaneous discretization of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is that one can approach the continuum in different directions .",
    "for example the approach to continuum at fixed @xmath100 is different from the approach studied in conventional dlcq .",
    "the latter keep @xmath2 continuous throughout ( in our language this means taking @xmath73 _ first _ followed by @xmath101 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the same continuum physics emerges in both cases .",
    "i would like to conclude this talk with some remarks on longer term prospects and goals .",
    "our renewed efforts to sum planar graphs have been directly stimulated by the ads / cft duality @xcite proposed in the last couple of years .",
    "this duality in turn was recognized @xcite to be a higher dimensional realization of t hooft s concept of holography @xcite : the vision that a consistent quantum theory of gravity requires our apparently 3 dimensional spatial world to be 2 dimensional .",
    "i have advocated string bits as a way to realize holography in t hooft s original 2 dimensional sense : the two dimensions being the transverse dimensions of light - cone string .",
    "however , the qcd gluons of this talk really live in 3 dimensions in spite of their description on the light - cone : the longitudinal dimension hasnt disappeared .",
    "rather , it has been disguised as a variable newtonian mass .",
    "( in the ads / cft duality this third dimension gets interpreted as a fifth dimension , whence holography is the statement that a 4 + 1 dimensional effective theory arises from a 3 + 1 dimensional quantum field theory . )",
    "the defining character of string bits is that they have a _ fixed _",
    "newtonian mass , in sharp contrast to the gluons we have been describing . to understand 3 + 1 gauge theories as part of a string bit theory , a gluon with @xmath11 must in reality be a composite of @xmath102 string bits : the gluon vertices would then be effective fission / fusion amplitudes as in nuclear physics , rather than fundamental interactions .",
