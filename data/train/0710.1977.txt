    "only those sequential transitions are energetically forbidden  the corresponding rates being exponentially small  that carry the dot out of the ground state @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig : chargingdiagram ] and @xmath150 .",
    "if the rate @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath153 , thus well below the lowest second - order tunneling rate , the relaxation hardly affects @xmath146 and @xmath149 , so that the system behaves as for @xmath171 .",
    "as the rates grow between @xmath153 and @xmath154 they eventually become much larger than every cotunneling rate , while still being smaller than sequential rates of energetically allowed processes .",
    "height and slope of the current step as well as the height of the conductance peak increase in this range to a maximum value at @xmath172 , since the relaxation diminishes @xmath146 in the inelastic part of the core and low bias part of the intermediate region but leaves it almost unaltered in the sequential part of the shell region .",
    "a relaxation with rate @xmath173 is ( roughly ) as fast as or faster than sequential tunneling and while @xmath146 in this parameter range shows no further relaxation dependence in the core , it decreases in the shell region for growing @xmath5 . as a result",
    "the current step and conductance peak decrease as well and vanish before @xmath174 . for rates @xmath175 transport properties",
    "do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "obviously there exists an optimal relaxation rate @xmath176 for which the signatures of cotunneling - mediated sequential transport have maximal height and are considerably more pronounced than for @xmath171 .",
    "also do the positions of the resonance signatures move to higher absolute values of @xmath103 , when @xmath5 is increased between @xmath156 and @xmath13 .",
    "as @xmath176 depends on the ratio @xmath177 , the coupling @xmath43 , and temperature @xmath178 in a complicated way , we can give no simple estimation of its value in terms of the system parameters other than : @xmath179 with @xmath180 for all parameter sets yielding reliable results .",
    "the height of the conductance peaks depends most strongly on @xmath5 throughout the whole range @xmath181 with @xmath182 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diffcondpeaks](b ) ) , while its relative variation for all values of @xmath183 amounts to only a few percent .",
    "therefore , we content ourself with the statement , that @xmath176 corresponds to a rate that is roughly as large as @xmath43 and very much larger than any cotunneling rate . in order to explain these observations , we examine how the tunneling processes that dominate the current in the relevant parts of the cotunneling regime are influenced by the relaxation .    in the inelastic part of the core region the current",
    "is caused solely by elastic and inelastic cotunneling , which also dominates the occupation of the single - particle states .",
    "in particular , inelastic tunneling provides an occupation of the excited state of order 1 that does nt depend on @xmath43 and is reduced by the relaxation , as soon as the magnitude of @xmath5 becomes at least comparable to @xmath184 .",
    "since the @xmath185 are much smaller than the single - particle occupations in the cotunneling regime , the current consists mainly of two contributions associated with cotunneling out of state @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are proportional to @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "hence , the cotunneling based on processes with initial state @xmath15 benefits from a change @xmath188 caused by relaxation , whereas the current with the dot being initially in state @xmath16 is decreased by it .",
    "so in the core region the dependence of the current change @xmath189 on @xmath190 is given by @xmath191 .",
    "the sums on the rhs have the same sign , which is for both contributions specified by the direction of current flow and thus by the sign of @xmath6 . for the inelastic part of the core one can establish the relation @xmath192 by looking at the energy dependence of elastic and inelastic processes . in the core ,",
    "an electron that elastically tunnels through the dot with initial ( and final ) state @xmath193 via virtual intermediate state @xmath25 has to overcome at least the energy difference @xmath194 , which is by @xmath13 smaller for an initially excited dot than for one in the ground state ( s. fig .",
    "[ fig : coretunneling ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the latter is also true for tunneling via virtual state @xmath22 , which can be seen analogously . as a consequence the rate for elastic cotunneling is smaller for @xmath195 than for @xmath196 .    for the inelastic processes",
    "a similar energy argument can be applied .",
    "inelastic tunneling out of the ground into the excited state can not set on before @xmath197 , because the energy @xmath13 , needed for the transition to take place , has to be provided by the reservoirs .",
    "in contrast , inelastic tunneling , causing the opposite transition , is always possible , because in this case the transition energy is provided by the dot .",
    "hence , if @xmath6 and @xmath198 specify a point in the core region , for @xmath196 there are always more electrons available for inelastic processes compared to the case @xmath195 ( s. fig .",
    "[ fig : coretunneling ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this results in a higher rate for inelastic tunneling through a dot in initial state @xmath16 and immediately leads to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : coreratecomparison ] ) . using this equation and the fact that @xmath190 is a positive , monotonic function in @xmath5 , for the core we can derive @xmath199 since in this region",
    "the single - particle occupations are determined mainly by cotunneling , they only depend on the relaxation , if @xmath5 is comparable to the second - order rates . due to the factor @xmath200 on the rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : currentrelaxdepcore ] ) , this dependence also holds for @xmath146 , whose absolute value decreases for @xmath5 growing between @xmath156 and @xmath43 and is constant for slower or faster relaxation , respectively .    in the inelastic part of the shell region",
    "the maximal cotunneling - provided occupation of the excited state is by a factor @xmath43 smaller than in the inelastic core , since it is reduced by sequential transport out of state @xmath16 , as long as @xmath201 .",
    "when the relaxation becomes faster than sequential tunneling , @xmath187 decreases and eventually goes to 0 for @xmath202 .",
    "the difference in size of sequential and cotunneling rates compensates for the reduction of the excited state occupation , so that the total current is higher in the shell compared to the core region .",
    "it consists of contributions associated with sequential tunneling out of states @xmath203 and cotunneling out of the ground state .",
    "when @xmath5 is not much larger than @xmath43 these contributions are all of the same order of magnitude , which is , however , not the case for their response to increasing relaxation . obviously , relaxation rates much higher than @xmath43 completely depopulate the excited state and the current caused by tunneling out of @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "its relative change in magnitude compared to the case of low relaxation is therefore of order 1 . for cotunneling out of state @xmath15 , on the other hand",
    ", the maximum relative change is @xmath204 hence , if the relaxation increases , the gain in the cotunneling current associated with @xmath186 can not compensate for the simultaneous suppression of the sequential current proportional to @xmath187 , which results in a reduced total current . similarly to the discussion of the core , however , it can be argued that in the shell , where the single - particle occupations are mainly determined by sequential processes , the total current can only show a considerable relaxation dependence , if @xmath5 is neither much smaller nor much larger than @xmath43 or , equivalently , than the rates for sequential tunneling . as we stated above , the current dependence on @xmath5 smoothly crosses over between the core- and shell - like behavior in the intermediate region , so that both the current step and the conductance peak grow with @xmath5 between @xmath156 and @xmath205 , while they decrease for @xmath206 and vanish before @xmath155 .",
    "the fact that the current becomes less sensitive to relaxation for higher values of @xmath207 , showing a sharp step - like dependence in the intermediate region , also manifests in the slight shift of the position of the excited state resonances to higher absolute bias values .",
    "in this paper we discussed coulomb - blocked electron transport through a slqd with spin - split level that is coupled to two non - magnetic , metallic leads .",
    "we used the real - time diagrammatic technique to systematically expand occupation probabilities and tunneling current up to the second - order in the strength @xmath43 of the tunnel coupling , thereby including sequential and cotunneling into the transport calculations .",
    "two properties were considered with respect to which the coulomb blockade regime can be subdivided into parts that differ at least in one of them : the kind of tunneling processes contributing to the current ( elastic , inelastic , sequential transport ) and those determining the single - particle occupations ( cotunneling in the core , sequential tunneling in the shell region ) . at or close to the borders between these sub - regimes ,",
    "signatures of the dot s excitation spectrum appear in the current and differential conductance . with the focus on excited state signatures marking the onset of cotunneling - mediated sequential transport",
    ", we studied how the current is influenced by a phenomenologically introduced spin relaxation with rate @xmath5 .",
    "it turned out that for a relaxation rate of about half the tunnel coupling the excited state resonances are maximally pronounced , being considerably larger than without relaxation , while in the limit of infinite @xmath5 the resonances completely vanish .",
    "we explained this behavior by a combination of two effects : ( i ) the current decreases monotonically with growing relaxation rates and ( ii ) the excited state occupation is in the cotunneling - dominated core and in the shell region only affected by a relaxation with rates in the range @xmath208 and @xmath209 with @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "this relaxation dependence of the current may illuminate why the resonance signatures measured in ref .",
    "are relatively sharp compared to the ones that were calculated for @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore it could provide means to directly influence the single - particle occupations in experiments and allows to facilitate measurements of excited state resonances by adjusting either the coupling @xmath43 or the rate @xmath5 .",
