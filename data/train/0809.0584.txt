    "the emerging class of @xmath1-ray binaries has three well - established members , psrb1259@xmath463/ss2883 @xcite ls5039 @xcite and lsi+61303 @xcite , all high - mass x - ray binary systems .-",
    "ray emission from this object is not firmly established  @xcite ] all these objects show variable or periodic tev @xmath1-ray emission with peak fluxes around @xmath5erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ( 110tev ) . as such fluxes are well above the sensitivity achieved by the hess galactic plane survey @xcite , the serendipitous discovery of new @xmath1-ray binaries might be expected in hess observations .",
    "indeed , the tev emission of ls5039 was discovered in this way .",
    "binaries are one of the few classes of sources expected to appear _ point - like _ for tev instruments . of the @xmath040 unidentified tev sources",
    "@xcite , only hessj1745@xmath4290 @xcite ( at the gravitational centre of the galaxy ) and hessj0632 + 057 @xcite are unresolved .",
    "for this reason alone hessj0632 + 057 can be considered as a candidate for a new binary system .",
    "hessj0632 + 057 was discovered in hess observations of the region of apparent interaction between the monoceros loop supernova remnant and the star - forming regions of the rosette nebula .",
    "three possible associations were suggested by the hess collaboration for this object : the unidentified _ rosat _ source 1rxs j063258.3 + 054857 , the unidentified _ egret _ source 3eg0634 + 0521 and the massive star mwc148 ( hd259440 , spectral type b0pe ) . to resolve the question of the association of these three objects , and to probe the greater than 3 kev emission of the x - ray source , an _ xmm - newton _ observation of this region",
    "was conducted in 2007 , the results and implications of which are described below .",
    "x - ray observations toward hessj0632 + 057 were taken on 2007 september 17 with the epic camera of _ xmm - newton _ for 46  ks ( observation id0505200101 ) . the analysis was carried out using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas , version 7.1.0 ) .",
    "the data were cleaned of a strong proton flare toward the end of the observation , resulting in a useful exposure of 26  ks during which all epic instruments were fully operational . the standard _ edetect_chain _",
    "tool was used to identify 31 @xmath85@xmath9 point - like sources in the field of view ( fov)(see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . by far",
    "the brightest source is that found at 6@xmath1032@xmath1159.29@xmath12  @xmath13  0.01@xmath12 , 5@xmath1448@xmath151.5@xmath16  @xmath13  0.1@xmath16 , within the hessj0632 + 057 error box and offset by 0.6@xmath16 from the position of mwc148 @xcite , consistent with the nominal 1@xmath16 rms absolute measurement accuracy of _ xmm - newton_. this object , xmmuj063259.3 + 054801 ( source # 1 ) , exhibits an integrated signal of 2140  @xmath13  50 counts .",
    "the source is unresolved and an upper limit on the intrinsic rms width of 1.0@xmath16 ( at 95% confidence ) has been derived by convolving the simulated point - spread function with an assumed gaussian emission profile .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the spatial relationship of source # 1 to hessj0632 + 057 and 1rxsj063258.3 + 054857 .",
    "energy spectra for source # 1 were extracted from a 25@xmath16 circular region centered on the best - fit position for each of the epic ccd cameras ( mos-1 , mos-2 and pn ) . for background estimation a 50100@xmath16 annulus around the source",
    "was used for the mos cameras and a 75@xmath16 circular region with an offset of 150@xmath16 from the source was used for the pn ( to avoid ccd chip edges ) .",
    "the resulting spectra were simultaneously fitted with an absorbed power - law model , and are shown in figure .",
    "the best - fit model has a photon index @xmath17=1.26@xmath130.04 , a column density @xmath18  =  ( 3.1@xmath130.3)@xmath19  @xmath6 , and 1  kev normalization of ( 5.4@xmath130.4)@xmath2010@xmath21 kev@xmath7 @xmath6 s@xmath7 , with @xmath22@xmath23/dof  =  27.6/27 . whilst a single temperature black body model is strongly excluded ( @xmath22@xmath23/dof  = 225/27 )",
    ", two temperature models provide a good fit with @xmath240.4 kev and @xmath252 kev ( @xmath22@xmath23/dof  = 15.8/25 ) .",
    "the deabsorbed 110  kev flux from the power - law fit is @xmath26 erg@xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "the count rate and hardness ratio ( hr2 ) of 1rxsj063258.3 + 054857 in the 0.42.4 kev _ rosat _ band are consistent ( within large statistical errors ) with the power - law model for source # 1 .",
    "there is , however , an apparently significant excess over the model in the region below @xmath27 kev where _ xmm - newton _ has limited sensitivity . the catalogue position of 1rxsj063258.3 + 054857 lies 57@xmath16 from source # 1 . following @xcite we estimate a combined statistical and systematic error of 41@xmath16 ( 65@xmath16 ) at 90% ( 99% ) confidence .",
    "given the consistency of the flux and spectrum in the region of overlap , the marginal positional agreement , and in the absence of any viable alternative counterpart , we tentatively identify 1rxsj063258.3 + 054857 with xmmuj063259.3 + 054801 .    a search for variability of source # 1 has been conducted , again using all three epic cameras .",
    "figure  [ figlc ] shows combined epic light curves for the signal and background regions described earlier .",
    "we find evidence of variability on a timescale comparable with the observation : a fit to a constant value yields a chance probability of @xmath28 .",
    "the data are consistent with a linear fit which implies a decrease of @xmath29% in flux over the 26  ks observation .",
    "we find no evidence of a change in spectral shape when splitting the data into two 13  ks slices . with @xmath30 fixed to @xmath31  @xmath6",
    "the spectral indices of the first and second segments are @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . with both @xmath30 and the spectral index fixed to the full - dataset values",
    "the best - fit normalization falls from ( 6.1@xmath130.2)@xmath2010@xmath21 kev@xmath7 @xmath6 s@xmath7 to ( 4.6@xmath130.2)@xmath2010@xmath21 kev@xmath7 @xmath6 s@xmath7 in the second slice .",
    "a fundamental question in the interpretation of xmmuj063259.3 + 054801 is the physical process responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "given the existence of tev emission from this region , it seems natural to attribute the power - law x - ray emission as synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "however , spectra resembling that observed for source # 1 ( consistent with two temperature blackbody models with @xmath340.5  kev and @xmath342  kev ) have been observed for isolated magnetic bp stars , such as @xmath9orie , and been attributed to shock heating of magnetically confined winds ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it seems possible that mwc148 is a system of this type , and that the observed x - ray emission is thermal in origin .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the tev @xmath1-ray emission in such a scenario . in the discussions that follow we assume that the observed x - ray emission is nonthermal in origin .",
    "if this is not the case , then the observed flux provides an upper limit on the nonthermal x - ray flux of hessj0632 + 057 .",
    "the probabilities of chance associations of hessj0632 + 057 with mwc148 and 1rxs j063258.3 + 054857 have been estimated as @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite respectively .",
    "the chance coincidence of a massive star with the 1@xmath16 error box of the brightest ( and the hardest spectrum ) source in an _ xmm - newton _ observation is even less probable ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the least secure association is that with 3eg0634 + 0521 , as @xmath010% of all galactic tev sources lie within the 99% confidence contour of a 3eg source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the binary system saxj0635 + 0533 ( composed of a 34  ms period pulsar and a be star ) has been suggested to power most or all of the flux of 3eg0634 + 0521  @xcite .",
    "however , as 3eg0634 + 0521 is flagged as extended and/or confused it seems plausible that hessj0632 + 057 may contribute to this emission .",
    "the relative contributions of these and other sources to 3eg0634 + 0521 should be established by the first months of data from _",
    "glast_. we note that there is no evidence of tev emission from saxj0635 + 0533 @xcite .",
    "if all the apparent associations of hessj0632 + 057 are correct then its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) bears a close resemblance to that of the known tev binaries .",
    "all have hard ( @xmath38 ) x - ray spectra and significantly softer tev spectra .",
    "furthermore , x - ray variability with timescales comparable to those observed here for source # 1 has been observed in lsi+61303 @xcite .",
    "associations with gev @xmath1-ray sources also exist in the cases of ls5039 ( 3egj1824@xmath41514 ) and lsi+61303 ( 3egj0241 + 6103 ) .",
    "these systems are powered by either a relativistic pulsar wind or a wind - accretion powered jet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an assessment of the possible power source of hess0632 + 057 requires an estimate of the distance to the system , using the apparent visual magnitude @xmath39 of mwc148 @xcite , assuming an absolute magnitude @xmath40 , and accounting for reddening assuming an intrinsic @xmath41 of -0.3 , we find a distance of @xmath421.5  kpc , consistent with that of the rosette nebula @xcite .",
    ", is compatible with the best fit @xmath43 for source # 1 , supporting the physical association of the two sources . ] at this distance , the @xmath44 limit on the intrinsic size ( and the similar limit on the projected displacement from mwc148 ) of the x - ray source implies an origin of the emission within @xmath45  cm of the star and hence a radiation density of greater than 10@xmath46  ev  @xmath47 . , where @xmath48 is the variability timescale of @xmath030  ks , leading to @xmath49 cm .",
    "] in the presence of such a strong , high - energy ( @xmath50@xmath03  ev ) photon field , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of @xmath0tev electrons must occur in the deep klein  nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "ic cooling is dominant if @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the suppression factor due to the kn effect .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath53 , and for @xmath54  ev and @xmath55  tev , @xmath56 .",
    "if ic cooling in the kn regime is dominant , then a hard x - ray spectrum and softer tev @xmath1-ray spectrum , as observed in this case , can be expected .",
    "such a scenario has been recently discussed for a pulsar wind nebula in the central parsec of our galaxy  @xcite and for binary systems such as psrb1259@xmath463/ss2883  @xcite .",
    "assuming for the moment a distance of the emission region from the star of a few au , radiation densities of @xmath571 erg  @xmath47 are expected .",
    "the relative flux of x - rays and tev @xmath1-rays then implies @xmath58 mg . for these radiation and magnetic fields 1 tev electrons",
    "produce x - rays of a few kev and @xmath1-rays of almost tev energy ( if the ic scattering proceeds in the deep kn regime ) .",
    "the cooling time ( @xmath59 ) for these electrons is then @xmath020  ks , compatible with the x - ray variability observed for source # 1 .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to synchrotron - dominated cooling , the cooling timescale is almost constant with energy in the region probed by synchrotron x - rays and no spectral variability is expected , again compatible with this observation .",
    "we note that in this scenario correlated x - ray and tev @xmath1-ray variability is expected .    an illustrative one - zone model with these parameters ( @xmath60  mg , @xmath61 erg  @xmath47 ) is shown in figure  [ fig_sed ] .",
    "particles are injected with a spectrum @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 tev , and cool continuously .",
    "the sed reaches an equilibrium state ( as shown ) for timescales @xmath65 ks .",
    "lower values of @xmath66 are difficult to reconcile with the highest - energy x - ray and @xmath1-ray data points .",
    "the effect of changing the minimum energy of injected electrons is shown in figure  [ fig_sed ] .",
    "we note that values as high as 100  gev ( long - dashed curve ) might be expected in the binary pwn scenario : _ glast _ is well suited to probe this region ( see sensitivity curve in figure  [ fig_sed ] ) .",
    "if genuinely associated , the flux level of 3eg0634 + 0521 may represent a higher state of this variable object , or indicate a softer electron spectrum in the gev range .",
    "the power requirements of the observed emission place limitations on the possible energy source in the system .",
    "the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed ] requires a power of @xmath67 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the luminosities in individual wavebands are @xmath68 erg s@xmath7 ( 110 kev ) , @xmath423@xmath69 erg s@xmath7 ( 0.22  gev ) , and @xmath425@xmath70 erg s@xmath7 ( 0.44  tev ) .",
    "these luminosities should be compared to the available kinetic power of the be - star wind ( @xmath71(@xmath67 ) erg s@xmath7 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wind accretion luminosity on to an ( unseen ) compact companion ( @xmath0@xmath72 erg s@xmath7 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spin - down power of an ( unseen ) young pulsar companion ( @xmath73@xmath74 erg s@xmath7 e.g. in psrb1259@xmath463 , * ? ? ?",
    "it seems very likely that the sources identified as hessj0632 + 057 and xmmu j063259.3 + 054801 originate in the same astrophysical object and that this object is associated with the be - star mwc148 . whilst the nature of this object remains uncertain , it is unlikely that an isolated star can provide the necessary power or accelerate particles to the required maximum energy of @xmath751  tev .",
    "mwc148 is , therefore , likely part of a binary system . by analogy with known @xmath1-ray binaries , which exhibit similar x - ray and tev spectra ,",
    "the unseen companion of mwc148 is likely a young pulsar or an accreting black hole or a neutron star driving a jet .",
    "the possible association of this object with 3eg0634 + 0521 will be tested in the near future using _ glast _ , which should achieve a source location accuracy of @xmath42100@xmath16 after 1 year .",
    "the observed emission and variability appear consistent with synchrotron and ic emission from a population of relativistic electrons in a region within a few au of the star",
