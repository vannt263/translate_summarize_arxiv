    "by now , a large collection of experimental data exists from the first relativistic collisions between truly heavy ions  @xcite , using the 11 gev / nucleon gold beams from the brookhaven ags and the 160 gev / nucleon lead beams from the cern sps .",
    "the first relativistic heavy - ion collider rhic at bnl will soon start taking data at @xmath0 @xmath1 gev , and in the next decade , the already approved lhc program at cern will explore relativistic heavy - ion collisions at even higher energies ( @xmath2 tev ) .",
    "the aim of this large scale experimental effort is to investigate the equilibration processes of hadronic matter and to test in this way the hadronic partition function at extreme energy densities and temperatures .",
    "especially , one expects under sufficiently extreme conditions the transition to a new state of hadronic matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in which the physical degrees of freedom of equilibration processes are partonic rather than hadronic  @xcite .",
    "qcd lattice simulations predict this transition to occur at a temperature of approximately 150 mev  @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of a possibly created qgp is , however , difficult , since only very few particle species , mainly leptons , can provide direct information about the initial partonic stage of the collision .",
    "the much more abundant hadrons are substantially affected by secondary interactions and decouple from the collision region only during the final ` freeze - out ' stage .",
    "a successful dynamical model of relativistic heavy - ion collisions should finally explain all these different observables , their dependence on the incident energy , impact parameter , and atomic number of the projectile and target nuclei .    at the present stage ,",
    "theoretical efforts concentrate on discriminating between different models by comparing them with characteristic observables  @xcite .",
    "the observed enhancement of strange hadron and low - mass dilepton yields and the measured @xmath3-suppression provide strong indications that a dense system was created in the collision whose extreme condition has significantly affected particle production mechanisms . furthermore , various observations signal collective ( hydro)dynamical behaviour in the collision region which in turn indicates the importance of equilibration processes for the understanding of the collision dynamics .",
    "especially , the hadronic momentum spectra show signs of both radial and azimuthally directed flow , and two - particle correlations indicate a strong transverse expansion of the source before freeze - out . despite the rich body of these and other observations , it remains however controversial to what extent these data are indicative for the creation of a qgp or can also be explained in purely hadronic scenarios .    to make further progress on this central issue , a more detailed understanding of the space - time geometry and dynamics of the evolving reaction zone",
    "is required .",
    "the systems created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions are mesoscopic and shortlived , and the geometrical and dynamical conditions of the cauldron play an essential role for the particle production processes .",
    "for example , the maximal energy density attained in the collision , the time - dependence of its decrease , and the momenta of the produced particles relative to the collectively expanding hadronic system will affect the observed particle ratios .",
    "two - particle correlations provide the only known way to obtain directly information about the space - time structure of the source from the measured particle momenta .",
    "the size and shape of the reaction zone and the emission duration become thus accessible . in combination with the analysis of single particle spectra and yields",
    ", it is furthermore possible to separate the random and collective contributions to the observed particle momenta .",
    "this permits to also reconstruct the collective dynamical state of the collision at freeze - out .",
    "these new pieces of information give powerful constraints for dynamical model calculations ; they can also be taken as an experimental starting point for a dynamical back extrapolation into the hot and dense initial stages of the collision .",
    "the present work reviews the foundations of hbt interferometry in particle physics and discusses the technical tools for its quantitative application to relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "hbt intensity interferometry was proposed and developed by the radio astronomer robert hanbury brown in the fifties , who was joined by richard twiss for the mathematical analysis of intensity correlations .",
    "their original aim was to bypass the major constraint of michelson amplitude interferometry at that time : in amplitude interferometry , the resolution at a given wavelength is limited by the separation over which amplitudes can be compared .",
    "hanbury brown started from the observation that `` if the radiation received at two places is mutually coherent , then the fluctuation in the intensity of the signals received at those two places is also correlated ''  @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , amplitude interferometry measures the square of the sum of the two amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 falling on two detectors 1 and 2 : @xmath6 the last term , the ` fringe visibility ' @xmath7 , is the part of the signal which is sensitive to the separation between the emission points . averaged over random variations ,",
    "its square is given by the product of the intensities landing on the two detectors  @xcite , @xmath8 the last two terms of this expression vary rapidly and average to zero . according to ( [ 1.2 ] ) , intensity correlations between different detectors contain information about the fringe visibility and hence about the spatial extension of the source . to demonstrate the technique , hanbury brown and twiss measured in 1950 the diameter of the sun , using two radio telescopes operating at 2.4 m wavelength , and determined in 1956 the angular diameters of the radio sources cas a and cyg a. furthermore , they measured in a highly influential experiment intensity correlations between two beams separated from a mercury vapor lamp .",
    "they thus demonstrated  @xcite that photons in an apparently uncorrelated thermal beam tend to be detected in close - by pairs . this photon bunching or hbt - effect ,",
    "first explained theoretically by purcell  @xcite , is one of the key experiments of quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "however , with the advent of modern techniques which allow to compare radio amplitudes of separated radio telescopes , michelson interferometry has again completely replaced intensity interferometry in astronomy .    in particle physics , the hbt - effect was independently discovered by g. goldhaber , s. goldhaber , w.y .",
    "lee and a. pais  @xcite . in 1960 , they studied at the bevatron the angular correlations between identical pions in @xmath9-annihilations .",
    "their observation ( the `` gglp - effect '' ) , an enhancement of pion pairs at small relative momenta , was explained in terms of the finite spatial extension of the decaying @xmath9-system and the finite quantum mechanical localization of the decay pions  @xcite . in the sequel of this work ,",
    "it was gradually realized that the correlations of identical particles emitted by highly excited nuclei are sensitive not only to the geometry of the system , but also to its lifetime  @xcite .",
    "this point has become increasingly more important , and it was supplemented by the later insight that the pair momentum dependence of the correlations measured for relativistic heavy - ion collisions contains information about the collision dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the origins of the wide field of applications to relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be dated back to the works of shuryak  @xcite , cocconi  @xcite , grishin , kopylov and podgoretski@xcite , and to the seminal paper of gyulassy , kauffmann and wilson  @xcite .",
    "important contributions in the eighties include a more detailed analysis of the role of final state interactions  @xcite , the development of a parametrization  @xcite taking into account the longitudinal expansion of the system created in the collision  @xcite and the first implementation of the hbt - effect in prescriptions for event generator studies  @xcite .",
    "also , the effect was seen in and analyzed for high energy collisions ( see the recent review by lrstad  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there is a wealth of experimental data and theoretical work on correlations between protons and heavier fragments ( pp , pd , p@xmath10he ) in lower energy ( @xmath11 gev ) nuclear collisions , which are summarized in the review article of boal , gelbke and jennings  @xcite .    with the advent of relativistic heavy - ion beams at cern and brookhaven , many of these concepts had to be refined and extended to the rapidly expanding particle emitting systems created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the relativistic collision dynamics plays an important role in the derivation of the hbt two - particle correlator and of its modern parametrizations .",
    "it is adequately reflected in recent model discussions of the particle phase - space density from which the two - particle correlator is calculated .",
    "several smaller reviews  @xcite as well as a selected reprint volume  @xcite exist by now .",
    "the present work aims at a unified presentation of the underlying concepts and calculational techniques , and of the phenomenological applications of hbt interferometry to the rapidly expanding sources created in these relativistic heavy - ion collisions . it does not provide a comprehensive review of the experimental data , for which we refer to the overview given in  @xcite",
    "we start by discussing the relation between the single - particle wigner phase - space density @xmath12 of the particle emitting source , the triple - differential one - particle spectrum @xmath13 and the two - particle correlation function @xmath14 for pairs of identical bosons : @xmath15\\ , .",

    "the main aim of particle interferometric methods is to extract as much information as possible about the emission function @xmath12 , which characterizes the particle emitting source created in the heavy - ion collision .",
    "we discuss how the above expressions are modified to include final state interactions and multiparticle symmetrization effects and how they apply to numerical event simulations of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "contact between theory and experiment is made with the help of gaussian parametrizations ( [ 1.5 ] ) of the correlator which we review in chapter  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we discuss the cartesian pratt - bertsch parametrization as well as the yano - koonin - podgoretski  ( ykp ) parametrization where the latter is particularly adapted to the description of systems with strong longitudinal expansion .",
    "we then turn to estimates of the pion phase space density based on such gaussian fits .",
    "our main focus is on the space - time interpretation of the hbt radius parameters @xmath16 which we establish in terms of space - time variances of the wigner phase - space density @xmath12 .",
    "particle emission duration , average particle emission time , transverse and longitudinal extension of the source as well as position - momentum correlations in the source due to dynamical flow patterns are seen to be typical source characteristics to which identical particle correlations are sensitive . while most of our discussion is carried out for central collisions , we also review how this framework can be extended to collisions at finite impact parameter where the hbt radius parameters depend on the azimuthal angle of the emitted particles with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "furthermore , we discuss more advanced techniques which do not rely on a gaussian parametrization of the correlation function but require better statistics of the experimental data .",
    "this concludes our review of existing analysis tools .",
    "chapter  [ sec5 ] is devoted to applications of the presented framework within concrete model studies .",
    "we introduce a simple but flexible class of models for particle emission in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "these are motivated by hydrodynamical and thermodynamical considerations and allow to illustrate the main techniques discussed before .",
    "different analytical and numerical calculation schemes for the hbt radius parameters are contrasted , and we explain which geometrical and dynamical model features are reflected by which observables .",
    "then we discuss how resonance decay contributions to pion spectra modify these calculations , and we compare the results of this model with various other model studies , focussing on the qualitative and quantitative differences .",
    "all these results are finally combined into an analysis strategy for the reconstruction of the particle emitting source from the measured one- and two - particle spectra .",
    "the method is illustrated on pb+pb data taken by the na49 collaboration at the cern sps .",
    "we use natural units @xmath17 . unless explicitly stated otherwise , _",
    "pairs _ or _ sets of n particles _ are meant to be pairs or sets of identical spinless bosons .",
    "in particular , we think of like - sign pions or kaons , the most abundant mesons in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "most of our discussion carries over to fermionic particles by replacing the @xmath18 signs in ( [ 1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.5 ] ) by @xmath19 signs and changing from symmetrized to anti - symmetrized @xmath20-particle states whereever they appear in derivations . in what follows",

    "this arises from the mass - shell constraint ( [ 2.27 ] ) which leads to a mixing of spatial and temporal variances in the observable hbt parameters .",
    "one of the most important questions is therefore which other properties of the expanding system can be exploited to further disentangle spatial and temporal information about the emission function .    for this",
    ", we note that independent of the particular emission function , no direction is distinguished in the transverse plane for @xmath22 .",
    "the _ out_- and _ side_-components of all observables coincide in this kinematical limit . for the space - time variances , this implies @xmath23 as long as the limit @xmath24 of the emission function @xmath12 results in an azimuthally symmetric expression ( an exception is the class of opaque source models discussed in section  [ sec5a2 ] ) , the above relations between the space - time variances at @xmath22 imply that the hbt radius parameters satisfy @xmath25 in phenomenological hbt analyses one very often exploits these relations by distinguishing between an _ implicit _ @xmath26-dependence ( due to the @xmath26-dependence of the space - time variances ) and an _ explicit _ one ( resulting from the mass - shell constraint @xmath27 ) . if the emission function features no position - momentum correlation , then all space - time variances are @xmath26-independent and eqs .",

    "this implies that the explicit @xmath26-dependence dominates if the emission duration is sufficiently large  @xcite or if the position - momentum correlations in the source are sufficiently weak  @xcite , @xmath31 in this case , the difference between these two hbt radius parameters gives direct access to the average emission duration @xmath32 of the source and allows to partially disentangle the spatial and temporal information contained in ( [ 3.10])-([3.15 ] ) .",

    "so far , the ykp - parametrization has not been extended to collisions at finite impact parameter .",

    "these affect the fit parameters for the intercept @xmath140 considerably and can lead to quantitative corrections of ( [ 5.55 ] ) of up to 10 %  @xcite .",

    "this is important since current measurements are consistent with a @xmath35-independent intercept parameter  @xcite .    aside from this ( model - independent ) lifetime effect , which generically increases the effective pion emission region , various model - dependent features can affect the degree to which resonance decay contributions change the shape of the correlator . in the model ( [ 5.1 ] ) for example , the size of the effective emission region in the transverse plane shrinks with increasing transverse flow @xmath241 approximately according to ( [ 5.40 ] ) .",
    "the simplified core - halo model  @xcite neglects the proper resonance decay kinematics and thus does not describe this effect . as a consequence , the direct resonance emission function @xmath395 in ( [ 5.1 ] ) has a smaller effective emission region than that of the thermal pions , due to the larger transverse mass @xmath274 of the parent resonance ( `` transverse flow effect '' ) . for finite transverse flow",

    "the physical origin of the @xmath35-slope of @xmath33 is , however , different in the two situations , and this shows up in the kurtosis of the correlator . without transverse flow , resonance decay contributions increase @xmath33 due to the lifetime effect . for non - zero transverse flow , on the other hand , the @xmath35-slope arises from the @xmath35-dependent shrinking ( [ 5.40 ] ) of the effective transverse emission region which is more prominent for resonances than for thermal pions .",
    "@xmath416 is spatially more extended in the transverse plane than @xmath417 , and thus `` covers '' a substantial part of the exponential tails of @xmath418  @xcite . as a consequence , the total emission function ( [ 5.20 ] ) shows much smaller deviations from a gaussian shape for the scenario with transverse flow and results in a more gaussian correlator .",

    "the key to a geometric and dynamical understanding of the measured two - particle correlations are the model - independent relations between the space - time variances ( gaussian widths ) of the emission function and the hbt radius parameters which are extracted from gaussian fits ( [ 1.5 ] ) to the two - particle correlator .",
    "these were derived in chapter  [ sec3 ] . in general",

    "these homogeneity regions typically decrease in the presence of temperature or flow velocity gradients which lead to characteristic position - momentum correlations in the source .",
    "generically , the homogeneity regions are smaller for pair with larger transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence of the two - particle correlator thus gives access to dynamical characteristics of the collision region .    expressing the hbt radius parameters in terms of space - time variances also shows explicitly how spatial and temporal information about the source is mixed in the measured momentum correlations .",
    "we explained this first for the cartesian parametrization of @xmath14 and its extension to collisions at non - zero impact parameter .",
    "we then introduced the ykp parametrization , an alternative gaussian parametrization of @xmath14 which is particularly well adapted for collision systems with strong longitudinal expansion : ( i ) three of the four ykp fit parameters are invariant under longitudinal lorentz boosts , i.e. their value do not depend on the observer frame .",
    "( ii ) the fourth fit parameter is the yano - koonin velocity which measures the longitudinal velocity of the particle emitting source element .",
    "its rapidity dependence allows to determine the strength of the longitudinal expansion in the collision region .",
    "( iii ) in the particular observer frame in which the yano - koonin velocity vanishes , the ykp radius parameters for a large class of emission functions cleanly separate the longitudinal , transverse and temporal aspects of the source .",
    "this considerably simplifies the space - time interpretation of the gaussian fit parameters considerably .",
    "an important aspect of hbt interferometry is that from a combined analysis of the single - particle spectra and hbt correlation radii an estimate of the average phase - space density of the source at freeze - out can be obtained .",
    "applied to heavy - ion data at the ags and sps , this method provided evidence for a universal freeze - out phase - space density for pions .",
    "its transverse momentum dependence is in rough agreement with expectations based on models assuming thermalization prior to freeze - out .",
    "the connection between hbt radii and space - time variances of the emission function is based on gaussian parametrizations of the source and the measured particle correlations .",
    "deviations of the two - particle correlator from a gaussian shape can contain additional space - time information which is not contained in the hbt radii . in chapter  [ sec4 ] we described refined techniques which give access to such additional information . the imaging method and the method of @xmath118-moments discussed in sections  [ sec4a ] and  [ sec4b ] characterize in different ways the relative source function @xmath161 which is defined as a time averaged distribution of relative distances in the source .",

    "the size and momentum dependence of the different hbt radius parameters and the transverse momentum slopes of the one - particle spectra were shown to depend in general only on one or two of the model parameters of the emission function .",
    "this allows for a simple analysis strategy for the reconstruction of the emission function .",
    "it was illustrated in section  [ sec5d ] in an application to preliminary data from the 158 @xmath1 gev lead beam experiment na49 at the cern sps .",

    "this information about the hadronic emission region provides a starting point for a dynamical back extrapolation into the hot and dense early stage of the collision , and it can be directly compared with the output of numerical event simulations of relativistic heavy - ion collisions . compared to an analysis based on momentum space information only , the additional space - time information obtained from particle interferometry provides severe constraints for our understanding of heavy - ion collision dynamics .",
    "remaining uncertainties in the approach were discussed .",
    "better experimental statistics and further progress in our quantitative understanding of effects which influence the pair momentum dependence of the two - particle correlator are expected to lead in the near future to considerable improvements in the analyzing power of this method .",

    "<S> in this report we give a detailed account on hanbury brown / twiss ( hbt ) particle interferometric methods for relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> these exploit identical two - particle correlations to gain access to the space - time geometry and dynamics of the final freeze - out stage . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the measured correlations in momentum space and the phase - space structure of the particle emitter is established , both with and without final state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> suitable gaussian parametrizations for the two - particle correlation function are derived and the physical interpretation of their parameters is explained . after reviewing various model studies , we show how a combined analysis of single- and two - particle spectra allows to reconstruct the final state of relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
