    "studies of high - redshift galaxies have now advanced well beyond @xmath17 , with the confirmation of a number of such systems using the keck ii 10-m telescope over the past year ( dey et  al .",
    "1998 ; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; weymann et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "a key issue for future studies of distant , early star - forming galaxies is the incidence of bright , high - redshift galaxies in the general field population .",
    "here we report on the discovery of a luminous @xmath0 ly@xmath11-emitting galaxy in the hawaii survey field ssa22 .    as part of our deep imaging searches to systematically identify and study high - redshift galaxies in blank survey fields ( cowie & hu 1998 ; hu et  al .  1998 ) and fields around high - redshift quasars ( hu , mcmahon , & egami 1996 ; hu & mcmahon 1996 ) , we have been conducting deep narrowband imaging on the keck ii 10-m telescope to look for high - redshift ly@xmath11-emitting galaxies .",
    "previous results from the deep lris narrowband surveys at 5390  , or @xmath18 , and 6741  , or @xmath19 , have been reported in cowie & hu ( 1998 ) and hu et  al .",
    "the present object , which we will refer to as ssa22-hcm1 , was discovered during the course of a @xmath20 search using a 105   bandpass narrowband filter centered on 8185  .",
    "the results of this survey will be reported in detail elsewhere ( hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1999 ) .",
    "we have chosen to describe this object separately because of its high luminosity , which places it at the high end of the luminosity function for optically selected galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "if the light is produced by massive star formation with a salpeter mass function , the inferred rate is 40 @xmath16 yr@xmath4 @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "deep multi - color imaging data with lris ( oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on the hawaii survey field ssa22 have been described in cowie & hu ( 1998 ) and hu et  al .",
    "the @xmath23 ly@xmath11 survey of this region was carried out with narrowband exposures in the 8185   filter obtained on ut 21 aug 1998 as a sequence of 9 1200s exposures .",
    "the present work augments the continuum data at the redder wavelengths by doubling the @xmath24-band exposures ( seven 360s exposures taken ut 21 aug 1998 ) , and by obtaining a line - free red continuum through an rg850 filter , hereafter referred to as @xmath7 band , on ut 17 sep 1998 as a dithered sequence of eighteen 330s exposures .",
    "conditions were photometric on these nights , with image fwhm @xmath25 for the @xmath7 band exposures and @xmath26 for the @xmath24 and 8185/105 narrowband exposures .",
    "these data were calibrated with spectrophotometric standards ( feige 110 , feige 15 , and hz4 [ massey et  al .",
    "1988 ; massey & gronwall 1990 ; oke 1990 ; stone 1996 ] ) and landolt standards ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the net exposure times for the combined lris imaging in these bands are summarized in table  [ tbl:1 ] , and multi - color images of ssa22-hcm1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the @xmath7 band is similar to the @xmath27 filter used by the sloan digital sky survey ( frei & gunn 1994 ; fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ; fukugita et  al .",
    "1996 ) and to the gunn @xmath10 ( schneider , gunn , & hoessel 1983 ; fukugita et  al .  1995 ) and gunn @xmath28 ( schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1989 ; fukugita et  al.1995 ) bands used in high-@xmath10 quasar searches .",
    "the combined filter + lris optics + ccd response curve yields an effective wavelength @xmath29   ( 9166   for a flat @xmath30 source ) and fwhm=1430  , with a peak response at 8811  . the net response is less than 1% of this maximum value at 8185  , so the @xmath7 band provides a long - wavelength continuum measurement uncontaminated by emission in the 8185   narrowband filter .",
    "candidate ly@xmath11 emitters were selected for spectroscopic followup from sources in the 5@xmath6 narrowband catalog with observed equivalent widths greater than 80   in the observed frame , which were also undetected in the @xmath31 band down to the @xmath32 limit of 27.5 . for the current work ,",
    "photometric measurements are made over matched @xmath33 diameter apertures , in contrast to the @xmath34 diameter apertures used in earlier work ( cowie & hu 1998 ; hu et  al .",
    "1998 ) , and are corrected to total magnitudes following cowie et  al.(1994 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 error limits given in table  [ tbl:1 ] , and in cowie & hu ( 1998 ) and hu , cowie , & mcmahon ( 1998 ) , are determined from flux measurements in random aperture samples laid down at positions away from identified sources , since in the deep exposures ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) magnitude limits are set by the background faint source population .",
    "these values can be up to @xmath36 mags brighter than limiting magnitudes estimated by background pixel statistics ( e.g. , dey et  al .",
    "1998 ) , depending on color bandpass .",
    "[ tbl:1 ]    spectra of candidates were obtained on lris in multi - slit masks with the 300@xmath37/mm grating on the nights of ut 16 and 18",
    "september 1998 , and with the 400@xmath37/mm and 150@xmath37/mm gratings on the nights of ut 17 september and 22 october 1998 .",
    "infrared images of ssa22-hcm1 at @xmath38 were obtained with nirc on the keck i telescope in 15000 s on ut 4 october 1998 under non - photometric conditions . these were cross - calibrated with @xmath38 images of the ssa22 field of near comparable depth from the hawaii survey program based on imaging with the 1024@xmath39 uh ir camera , quirc , ( hodapp et  al .",
    "1996 ) at the uh 2.2 m telescope and cfht 3.6 m telescope .",
    "however , the @xmath40 detection limits given in table  [ tbl:1 ] are based on the quirc survey data alone .",
    "the ssa22-hcm1 galaxy is characterized by both a strong color break and strong ly@xmath11 emission .",
    "the high contrast of this object in the emission - line bandpass can be seen in the narrowband 8185/105   panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and in the extended appearance of ssa22-hcm1 in this band compared with the red @xmath7 and @xmath24 continuum bandpass images .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) , with at least a factor 4.2 jump based on the @xmath41 color difference .",
    "it is completely absent in the @xmath42- , @xmath31- , and most significantly , @xmath8-band images . for the @xmath8-band non - detection",
    "we use the @xmath43 estimate of 27.1 ( @xmath44 magnitude ) to set the lower limit of @xmath45 and estimate a minimum break strength .",
    "the break may also be seen in the spectral data , and in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we show a composite 10800 s lris spectrum .",
    "the heavy lines show the averaged continuum values for the wavelength regions sampled above and below the strong emission feature , and while there is a significant positive signal above the line the spectrum is consistent with there being zero flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the region of the 8190   emission line in the unsmoothed summed spectrum of all observations made with the @xmath46/mm grating ( 18,000 s ) .",
    "the line is unresolved at an instrumental resolution of 12.4   fwhm , corresponding to a velocity @xmath47 km s@xmath4 , instrument problems prevented acquisition of sufficient higher resolution observations to test for line asymmetry .",
    "examination of the spectral data provides a rough consistency check of the continuum and line properties .",
    "following oke and korycansky ( 1982 ) , we measure the flux deficit parameter @xmath48 using the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath49   for @xmath50 and @xmath51   for the red observed continuum .",
    "these yield @xmath52jy and @xmath53jy , respectively .",
    "this gives a formal ratio @xmath54 , similar to the limit obtained with the @xmath7- and @xmath8-band filters ( @xmath55 ) , and again it is the limits on the non - detection of the galaxy at shorter wavelengths that constrains the lower limit on @xmath56 .",
    "the errors in these faint continuum measurements based on spectroscopy are dominated by nightsky subtraction and systematic errors , and are not gaussian .",
    "the filter photometry provides a more robust and conservative determination of the continuum break .",
    "however , the emission line flux calculated from the spectroscopic data ( @xmath57 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) and the continuum magnitudes ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) agree with the @xmath8 and @xmath7 continuum magnitudes listed in table  [ tbl:1 ] , and are consistent with a flat @xmath30 spectrum plus a break . identifying the line with ly@xmath11 , we find the redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining properties of the line are best determined from the imaging data , and we find from these that it has an observed equivalent width of 175   and a flux of @xmath60 erg cm@xmath39 s@xmath4 .",
    "the object most similar to ssa22-hcm1 among those known in the current literature is the @xmath13 galaxy , hdf 4 - 473.0 ( weymann et  al .",
    "1998 ) , which shows both the strong continuum break between the f606w and f814w ( and infrared f110w and f160w bands at @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , and an emission line of roughly comparable equivalent width and flux , corresponding to ly@xmath11 at @xmath13 .",
    "the ly@xmath11 flux of ssa22-hcm1 is approximately twice as strong , and the continuum above the break a factor of 3 times more luminous than for this @xmath13 galaxy , using the near - ir magnitude of hdf 4 - 473.0 , ab(f110w)=26.64 , to approximate its continuum . in comparison , while the estimated continuum magnitudes above ly@xmath11 for the two spinrad et  al .",
    "galaxies are comparable to that of ssa22-hcm1 ( 24.9 and 25.7 ab mags for 3 - 951.1 and 3 - 951.2 vs.  25.5 , estimated from our @xmath7-band observations ) , neither of these systems shows any emission , while the dey et  al .",
    "object , rd1 , has much higher equivalent width ( 600  ) , and a fainter continuum above ly@xmath11 ( 26.3 ab mags based on the much more uncertain spectroscopic estimates ) .    since resonant scattering enhances the effects of extinction , converting the ly@xmath11 emission into a massive star formation rate entails large uncertainties .",
    "for the present calculation , we assume that extinction may be neglected in computing the required massive star formation rates , which then constitute a minimum estimate .",
    "the maximum values obtainable from ionization by a massive star population lie in the @xmath64   range ( charlot & fall 1993 ; valls - gabaud 1993 ) .",
    "up to roughly half the rest - frame emission may be eaten away by the lyman alpha forest , and applying such a correction factor would give values above 50  , as compared to the weymann et  al .",

    "assuming case b recombination , we have @xmath65ly@xmath11 ) = 8.7@xmath65h@xmath11 ) ( brocklehurst 1971 ) , which using s ( 1983 ) translation of @xmath66 from h@xmath11 luminosity , gives @xmath67ly@xmath11)/@xmath68 ergs s@xmath4 ) @xmath16 yr@xmath4 . for @xmath69",
    "km s@xmath4 and @xmath22 , the observed line flux of @xmath60 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 translates into a star formation rate of 19 @xmath16  yr@xmath4 .",
    "( for @xmath70 , the line luminosity would be a factor of 1.9 times lower ; and for @xmath71 , a factor of 6 times lower than for the present calculation . )",
    "these values , which are uncorrected for dust extinction , are consistent with the maximum values seen in the estimates for the systems up to @xmath72 in the lyman break galaxies studied to @xmath73 , which have rest - frame equivalent widths up to 80   ( steidel et  al .",
    "1999 ) . for @xmath69",
    "km s@xmath4 and @xmath22 , the continuum luminosity at rest - frame 1500  is @xmath74 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xmath4 , and corresponds to a star formation rate ( e.g. , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) of roughly 40 @xmath16  yr@xmath4 , consistent with the lower limit set by the emission line calculation .    because ssa22-hcm1 is so bright in @xmath7 it is of interest to estimate the number of potential high redshift ( @xmath75 ) objects from ( @xmath76 ) color statistics using a @xmath77 sample .",
    "( although this @xmath7 band criterion is not sufficiently deep to include ssa22-hcm1 , the @xmath13 galaxy hdf 4 - 473.0 ( weymann et  al .  1998 ) , or the @xmath78 emission - line object ( @xmath79 ; dey et  al .",
