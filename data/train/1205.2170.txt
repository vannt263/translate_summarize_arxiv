    "the universality of search behaviors is reflected in multitudes of studies in different fields including control systems , distributed computing and biology .",
    "we use tools from distributed computing to study a biologically inspired scenario in which a group of agents , initially located at one central location , cooperatively search for treasures in the plane .",
    "the goal of the search is to locate nearby treasures as fast as possible and at a rate that scales well with the number of participating agents .    a variety of animal species search for food around a central location that serves the search s initial point , final destination or both  @xcite .",
    "this central location could be a food storage area , a nest where offspring are reared or simply a sheltered or familiar environment .",
    "central place foraging holds a strong preference to locating nearby food sources before those that are further away .",
    "possible reasons for that are , for example : ( 1 ) decreasing predation risk  @xcite , ( 2 ) increasing the rate of food collection once a large quantity of food is found  @xcite , ( 3 ) holding a territory without the need to reclaim it  @xcite , and ( 4 ) the ease of navigating back after collecting the food using familiar landmarks  @xcite .    searching in groups",
    "can increase foraging efficiency  @xcite . in some extreme cases , food is so scarce that group searching is believed to be required for survival  @xcite .",
    "proximity of the food source to the central location is again important in this case .",
    "for example , in the case of recruitment , a nearby food source would be beneficial not only to the individual that located the source but also increase the subsequent retrieval rate for many other collaborators  @xcite .",
    "foraging in groups can also facilitate the defense of larger territories  @xcite .",
    "eusocial insects ( e.g. , bees and ants ) engage in highly cooperative foraging , which can be expected as these insects reduce competition between individuals to a minimum and share any food that is found .",
    "social insects often live in a single nest or hive , which naturally makes their foraging patterns central .",
    "little is known about the communication between foragers , but it is believed that in some scenarios communication may become impractical  @xcite .",
    "this holds , for example , if the foragers start the search at different times and remain far apart ( which may be necessary to avoid unnecessary overlaps ) .",
    "hence , the question of how efficient the search can be if the communication is limited , or altogether absent , is of great importance .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically address general questions of collective searches in the particular natural setting described above .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the _ ants nearby treasure search ( ants ) _ problem , in which @xmath0 identical ( probabilistic ) agents , initially placed at some central location , collectively search for a treasure in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "the treasure is placed by an adversary at some target location at distance @xmath1 from the central location , where @xmath1 is unknown to the agents .",
    "the goal of the agents is to find the treasure as fast as possible , where the time complexity is evaluated as a function of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the context of search algorithms , evaluating the time as a function of @xmath1",
    "was first introduced in a classical paper by baeza - yates _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who studied the _ cow - path _ problem ( studied also in @xcite ) .",
    "the ants problem generalizes the cow - path problem , as it considers multiple identical agents instead of a single agent ( a cow in their terminology ) .",
    "indeed , in this distributed setting , we are concerned with the _ speed - up _ measure ( see also ,  @xcite ) , which aims to capture the impact of using @xmath0 searchers in comparison to using a single one . note that the objectives of quickly finding nearby treasures and having significant speed - up may be at conflict .",
    "that is , in order to ensure that nearby treasures are quickly found , a large enough fraction of the search force must be deployed near the central location . in turn , this crowding can potentially lead to overlapping searches that decrease individual efficiency .",
    "it is a rather straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is @xmath2 .",
    "our focus is on the question of how agents can approach this bound if their communication is limited or even completely absent . in particular , as information of the size of the foraging group may not be available to the individual searchers , we concentrate our attention on the question of how important it is for agents to know ( or estimate ) their total number . as we later show , the lack of such knowledge may have a non - negligible impact on the performance .",
    "we introduce and investigate the ants problem , a generalization of the cow - path problem .",
    "first , we show that if the agents have a constant approximation of their total number @xmath0 , then there exists a rather simple search algorithm whose expected running time is @xmath3 , making it @xmath4-competitive .",
    "we then turn our attention to _ uniform _ searching algorithms , in which the agents are not assumed to have any information regarding @xmath0 .",
    "we completely characterize the speed - up penalty that must be paid when using uniform algorithms .",
    "specifically , we show that for a function @xmath5 such that @xmath6 converges , there exists a uniform search algorithm that is @xmath7-competitive . on the other hand",
    ", we show that if @xmath6 diverges , then there is no uniform search algorithm that is @xmath7-competitive . in particular",
    ", this implies that , for every constant @xmath8 , there exists a uniform search algorithm that is @xmath9-competitive , but there is no uniform search algorithm that is @xmath10-competitive .",
    "hence , the penalty for using uniform algorithms is slightly more than logarithmic in the number of agents .",
    "in addition , we give a lower bound for the intermediate setting in which the agents are given some estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "as a special case , this lower bound implies that for any constant @xmath11 , if each agent is given a ( one - sided ) @xmath12-approximation of @xmath0 , then the competitiveness is @xmath13 .",
    "informally , our results imply that the agents can potentially perform well without any knowledge of their total number @xmath0 , however , to further improve they must use non trivial information regarding @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we propose a uniform search algorithm that is concurrently efficient and extremely simple and , as such , it may imply some relevance for actual biological scenarios .",
    "our work falls within the scope of natural algorithms , a recent attempt to investigate biological phenomena from an algorithmic perspective  @xcite .",
    "collective search is a classical problem that has been extensively studied in different fields of science .",
    "group living and food sources that have to be actively sought after make collective foraging a widespread biological phenomenon .",
    "social foraging theory  @xcite makes use of economic and game theory to optimize food exploitation as a function of the group size and the degree of cooperativity between agents in different environmental settings .",
    "social foraging theory has been extensively compared to experimental data ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) but does not typically account for the spatial characteristics of resource abundance .",
    "central place foraging theory  @xcite assumes a situation in which food is collected from a patchy resource and is returned to a particular location , such as a nest .",
    "this theory is used to calculate optimal durations for exploiting food patches at different distances from the central location and has also been tested against experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "collective foraging around a central location is particularly interesting in the case of social insects where large groups forage cooperatively with , practically , no competition between individuals .",
    "harkness and mardouras  @xcite have conducted a joint experimental and modeling research into the collective search behavior of non - communicating desert ants .",
    "modeling the ants trajectories using biased random walks , they reproduce some of the experimental findings and demonstrate significant speed - up with group size",
    ". in bold contrast to these random walks , reynolds  @xcite argues that lvy flights with a power law that approaches unity is the optimal search strategy for cooperative foragers as traveling in straight lines tends to decrease overlaps between searchers .    from an engineering perspective , the distributed cooperation of a team of autonomous agents ( often referred to as robots or uavs : unmanned aerial vehicles ) is a problem that has been extensively studied .",
    "these models extend single agent searches in which an agent with limited sensing abilities attempts to locate one or several mobile or immobile targets  @xcite .",
    "the memory and computational capacities of the agent are typically large and many algorithms rely on the construction of cognitive maps of the search area that includes current estimates that the target resides in each point  @xcite .",
    "the agent then plans an optimal path within this map with the intent , for example , of optimizing the rate of uncertainty decrease  @xcite .",
    "cooperative searches typically include communication between the agents that can be transmitted up to a given distance , or even without any restriction .",
    "models have been suggested where agents can communicate by altering the environment to which other agent then react  @xcite .",
    "cooperation without communication has also been explored to some extent  @xcite but the analysis puts no emphasis on the speed - up of the search process .",
    "in addition , to the best of our knowledge , no works exist in this context that put emphasis on finding nearby targets faster than faraway one .",
    "similar problems studied in this context are pattern formation  @xcite , rendezvous  @xcite , and flocking  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that in all those engineering works , the issue of whether the robots know their total number is typically not addressed , as obtaining such information does not seem to be problematic .",
    "furthermore , in many works , robots are not identical and have unique identities .    in the theory of computer science ,",
    "the exploration of graphs using mobile agents is a central question .",
    "most of the research for graph exploration is concerned with the case of a single deterministic agent exploring a finite graph ( typically , with some restrictions on the resources of the agent and/or on the graph structure ) .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the agent explores strongly connected directed finite graphs , and in  @xcite the agent explores undirected finite graphs .",
    "when it comes to probabilistic searching , the random walk is a natural candidate , as it is extremely simple , uses no memory , and trivially self - stabilizes .",
    "unfortunately , however , the random walk turns out to be inefficient in a two - dimensional infinite grid .",
    "specifically , in this case , the expected hitting time is infinite , even if the treasure is nearby .",
    "evaluating the time to find the treasure as a function of @xmath1 , the initial distance to the treasure , was studied in the context of the cow - path problem .",
    "one of the first papers that studied the cow - path problem is a paper by baeza - yates _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which the competitive ratio for deterministically finding a point on the real line is shown to be nine . considering the two - dimensional case , baeza - yates _ et al .",
    "_ proved that the spiral search algorithm is optimal up to lower order terms .",
    "randomized algorithms for the problem were studied by kao _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , for the infinite star topology .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied an early variant of the cow - path problem on a binary tree .",
    "recently , demaine _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the cow - path problem with a double component price : the first is distance and the second is turn cost .",
    "lpez - ortiz and sweet  @xcite extended the cow - path problem by considering @xmath0 agents .",
    "however , in contrast to the ants problem , the agents they consider are not identical , and the goal is achieved by ( centrally ) designing a different specific path for each of the @xmath0 agents .",
    "in general , the more complex setting of using multiple identical agents has received much less attention .",
    "exploration by deterministic multiple agents was studied in , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "to obtain better results when using several identical deterministic agents , one must assume that the agents are either centrally coordinated or that they have some means of communication ( either explicitly , or implicitly , by being able to detect the presence of nearby agents ) .",
    "when it comes to probabilistic agents , analyzing the speed - up measure for @xmath0-random walkers has recently gained attention . in a series of papers , initiated by alon _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a speed - up of @xmath14 is established for various finite graph families , including , in particular , expanders and random graphs  @xcite .",
    "while some graph families enjoy linear speed - up , for many graph classes , to obtain linear speed - up , @xmath0 has to be quite small .",
    "in particular , this is true for the two - dimensional @xmath15-node grid , where a linear speed up is obtained when @xmath16 . on the other hand , the cover time of @xmath17-dimensional @xmath15-node grid is always @xmath18 , regardless of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , when @xmath0 is polynomial in @xmath15 , the speed up is only logarithmic in  @xmath0 . the situation with infinite grids is even worse .",
    "specifically , though the @xmath0-random walkers would find the treasure with probability one , the expected time to find the treasure becomes infinite .",
    "the question of how important it is for individual processors to know their total number has recently been addressed in the context of locality . generally speaking , it has been observed that for several classical local computation tasks , knowing the number of processors is not essential  @xcite . on the other hand , in the context of local decision , some evidence exist that such knowledge may be crucial for non - deterministic distributed decision  @xcite .",
    "we consider the ants problem , where @xmath0 mobile _ agents _ ( robots ) are searching for a _ treasure _ on the two - dimensional plane .",
    "each agent has a field of view bounded by a small positive constant , hence , for simplicity , we can assume that the agents are actually walking on the integer two - dimensional infinite grid @xmath19 .",
    "all @xmath0 agents starts the search from a central node @xmath20 of @xmath21 , called the _",
    "source_. an adversary locates the treasure at some node @xmath22 of @xmath21 , referred to as the _ target _ node ; the agents have no a priori information about the location of @xmath22 . the goal of the agents it to _ find _ the treasure : this task is accomplished once at least one of the agents visits the node  @xmath22 .    the agents are probabilistic machines that can move on the grid , but can not communicate between themselves .",
    "all @xmath0 agents are identical ( execute the same protocol ) .",
    "an agent can traverse an edge of the grid in both directions .",
    "we do not restrict the internal storage and computational power of agents , nevertheless , we note that all our upper bounds use simple procedures that can be implemented using relatively short memory . for example , with respect to navigation , our constructions only assume the ability to perform four basic procedures , namely : ( 1 ) choose a direction uniformly at random , ( 2 ) walk in a `` straight '' line to a prescribed distance , ( 3 ) perform a _ spiral search _ around a node is a particular deterministic local search algorithm ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that starts at @xmath23 and enables the agent to visit all nodes at distance @xmath24 from @xmath23 by traversing @xmath25 edges , for every integer @xmath25 . for our purposes ,",
    "since we are concerned only with asymptotic results , we can replace this atomic navigation procedure with any procedure that guarantees such a property . for simplicity , in the remainder of the paper , we assume that for every integer @xmath25 , the spiral search of length @xmath25 starting at a node @xmath23 visits all nodes at distance at most @xmath26 from @xmath23 ] , and ( 4 ) return to the source node . on the other hand , for our lower bounds to hold , we do not require any restriction on the navigation capabilities .    regarding the time complexity , we assume that traversing an edge takes one unit of time . furthermore ,",
    "for the ease of presentation , we assume that the agents are synchronous , that is , each edge traversal costs precisely one unit of time ( and all internal computations are performed in zero time ) .",
    "indeed , this assumption can easily be removed if we measure the time according to the slowest edge - traversal .",
    "we also assume that all agents start the search simultaneously at the same time , denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "this assumption can also be easily removed by starting to count the time after the last agent initiates the search .",
    "we measure the cost of an algorithm by its _ expected running time _ , that is , the expected time ( from time @xmath28 ) until at least one of the agents finds the treasure .",
    "we denote the expected running time of algorithm @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath31 between two nodes @xmath32 and @xmath23 of @xmath21 is simply the hop distance between them , i.e. , the number of edges on a shortest path connecting @xmath32 and @xmath23 in @xmath21 .",
    "the distance between a node @xmath32 and the source node @xmath20 is simply written @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath34 . let @xmath1 be the distance between the source node @xmath20 and the target node @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "for a node @xmath32 of @xmath21 and an integer @xmath36 , let @xmath37 be the ball of radius @xmath36 centered at the node @xmath32 , formally , @xmath38 .",

    "an agent can find the treasure in time @xmath42 by performing a spiral search around the source .",
    "when considering @xmath0 agents , it is easy to see whose expected running time is @xmath43",
    ". clearly , @xmath44 , because it takes time @xmath1 to merely reach the treasure .",
    "assume , towards a contradiction , that @xmath45 . in any execution of @xmath29 , by time @xmath46 , the @xmath0 agents can visit a total of at most @xmath47 nodes .",
    "hence , by time @xmath46 , more than half of the nodes in @xmath48 were not visited .",
    "therefore , there must exist a node @xmath49 such that the probability that @xmath32 is visited by time @xmath46 ( by at least one of the agents ) is less than @xmath50 .",
    "if the adversary locates the treasure at @xmath32 , then the expected time to find the treasure is strictly greater than  @xmath43 , which contradicts the assumption . ] that the expected running time is @xmath51 , even if the total number of agents @xmath0 is known to all agents , and even if we relax the model and allow agents to freely communicate between each other .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thm : know - k ] that if @xmath0 is known to agents then there exists a search algorithm whose expected running time is asymptotically optimal , namely , @xmath3 .",

    "hence , @xmath182 , and therefore using the expected running time of the algorithm , it follows that for each node @xmath183 , the expected time until at least one of the @xmath140 agents covers @xmath32 is at most @xmath184    recall that we now consider the case where the algorithm is executed with @xmath140 agents . for every subset @xmath141 of nodes of @xmath21 ,",

    "since this holds for any @xmath58 in @xmath186 , and since the sets @xmath153 are pairwise disjoint , the linearity of expectation implies that the expected number of nodes that a single agent visits by time @xmath46 is @xmath187 . since @xmath188 , this implies that @xmath189 , as desired .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "the algorithms described in the section  [ sec : upper ] are relatively simple but still require the use of non trivial iterations , which may be complex for simple and tiny agents , such as ants .",
    "if we relax the requirement of bounding the expected running time and demand only that the treasure be found with some low constant probability , then it is possible to avoid one of the loops of the algorithms .",
    "however , a sequence of iterations still needs to be performed .    in this section",
    ", we propose an extremely simple algorithm , coined the _ _ harmonic search algorithm__-server problem  see , e.g. ,  @xcite . ] , which does not perform in iterations and",
    "is essentially composed of three components : ( 1 ) choose a random direction and walk in this direction for a distance of @xmath190 , chosen randomly according to a distribution in which the probability of choosing @xmath190 is roughly inverse proportional to @xmath190 , ( 2 ) perform a local search ( e.g. , a spiral search ) for time roughly @xmath191 , and ( 3 ) return to the source .",
    "it turns out that this extremely simple algorithm has a good probability of quickly finding the treasure , if the number of agents is sufficiently large .",
    "more specifically , the algorithm depends on a positive constant parameter @xmath192 that is fixed in advance and governs the performance of the algorithm . for a node @xmath32 ,",
    "let @xmath193 , where @xmath108 is the normalizing factor , defined so that @xmath194 .",
    "( note that @xmath108 depends on @xmath192 . )    using arguments similar to those introduced earlier , e.g. , in the proofs of theorems  [ thm : know - k ] and  [ thm : comp ] , one can prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "for every @xmath11 , there exists a positive real number @xmath196 such that if the number @xmath0 of agents is greater than @xmath197 , then with probability at least @xmath198 , the expected running time of the harmonic algorithm is @xmath199",
    "we first presented an algorithm that assumes that agents have a constant approximation of @xmath0 and runs in optimal expected time , that is , in time @xmath3 .",
    "we then showed that there exists a uniform search algorithm whose competitiveness is slightly more than logarithmic , specifically , @xmath9 , for an arbitrarily small positive constant @xmath123 .",
    "we also presented a relatively efficient uniform algorithm , namely , the harmonic algorithm , that has and extremely simple structure .",
    "our constructions imply that , in the absence of any communication , multiple searchers can still potentially perform rather well . on the other hand ,",
    "our lower bounds imply that to achieve a better running time , the searchers must either communicate or utilize some information regarding @xmath0 . in particular , even providing each agent with a @xmath12-approximation to @xmath0 ( for constant @xmath11 ) does not suffice to bring the competitiveness strictly below @xmath10 .",
    "although the issue of memory is beyond the scope of this paper , our constructions are simple and can be implemented using relatively low memory .",
    "for example , going in a straight line for a distance of @xmath200 can be implemented using @xmath201 memory bits , by employing a randomized counting technique .",
    "in addition , our lower bounds provide evidence that in order to achieve a near - optimal running time , agents must use non - trivial memory size , required merely to store the necessary approximation of @xmath0",
    ". this may be useful to obtain a tradeoff between the running time and the memory size of agents .    from another perspective , it is of course interesting to experimentally verify whether social insects engage in search patterns in the plane which resemble the simple uniform algorithms specified above , and , in particular , the harmonic algorithm .",
    "two natural candidates are desert ants _ cataglyphys _ and honeybees _ apis mellifera_. first , these species seem to face settings that are similar to the one we use .",
    "indeed , they can not rely on communication during the search due to the dispersedness of individuals  @xcite and their inability to leave chemical trails ( this is due to increased pheromone evaporation in the case of the desert ant ) . additionally , the task of finding the treasure is relevant , as food sources in many cases are indeed relatively rare or patchy .",
    "moreover , due to the reasons mentioned in section  [ sec : introduction ] , finding nearby sources of food is of great importance .",
    "second , insects of these species have the behavioral and computational capacity to maintain a compass - directed vector flight  @xcite , measure distance using an internal odometer  @xcite , travel to distances taken from a random power law distribution  @xcite , and engage in spiral or quasi - spiral movement patterns  @xcite .",
    "these are the main ingredients that are needed to perform the algorithms described in this paper .",
    "finally , the search trajectories of desert ants have been shown to include two distinguishable sections : a long straight path in a given direction emanating from the nest and a second more tortuous path within a small confined area  @xcite .",
