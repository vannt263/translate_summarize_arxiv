    "geometrically frustrated magnets with competing exchange interactions often display continuous , symmetry unrelated degeneracy of classical ground states .",
    "such an ` accidental ' degeneracy may be lifted by weak additional interactions .",
    "those are always present in real materials but can significantly vary even between similar compounds . therefore",
    ", a lot of studies on frustrated magnets have been devoted to understanding the universal degeneracy - lifting mechanism produced by thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding concept named `` order by disorder '' was pioneered by villain _",
    "[ ] and shender [ ] and , in a nutshell , relates the ground - state selection to softer excitation spectrum for certain degenerate states .",
    "being investigated for numerous spin models , the order by disorder mechanism finds so far only a few realizations in magnetic materials .",
    "perhaps the clearest examples of the order by disorder selection are provided by the 1/3-magnetization plateau in triangular - lattice antiferromagnets [ ] and by a zero - field noncoplanar spin structure of the @xmath0 pyrochlore antiferromagnet @xmath6 [ , ] .    weak lattice disorder , if present in a magnetic solid , changes locally parameters of the spin hamiltonian and can also affect the ground state selection [ ] . for a few studied models , the structural disorder tends to select classical ground - states in precisely the opposite manner compared to the thermal and quantum effects .",
    "these include an orthogonal magnetic structure for the @xmath7@xmath8 square lattice antiferromagnet [ , ] and a conical state for the heisenberg triangular - lattice antiferromagnet in an external field [ ] . in our previous work ,",
    "such a difference was explained by opposite signs of effective biquadratic interactions generated by two types of the order from disorder : thermal and quantum fluctuations yield a negative biquadratic exchange [ , ] , whereas bond and site disorder produce a positive biquadratic term [ ] .",
    "note , that in a rather different context a positive biquadratic coupling in ferromagnetic multilayers was attributed to interface roughness [ ] .",
    "the known examples bring up a problem of further generalization of the above principle .",
    "specifically , for some highly symmetric frustrated spin models , an effective interaction that is able to lift the classical degeneracy appears only beyond the fourth - order terms in the landau energy functional .",
    "then , a biquadratic coupling of either sign leaves degeneracy intact raising again the question about the outcome of the order from structural disorder selection .    as a matter of fact , such a highly symmetric frustrated spin model is realized in the anisotropic @xmath0 pyrochlore @xmath6 [ ] .",
    "this pyrochlore material orders at @xmath9  k into a noncoplanar @xmath10 antiferromagnetic structure called the @xmath4 state [ , ] . to emphasize its symmetry properties we shall denote this state as @xmath5 in the following . at the mean - field level , there is no energy difference between the @xmath11 state and the coplanar @xmath12 ( @xmath2 ) state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] .",
    "the two states form a basis of the @xmath13 irreducible representation of the tetrahedral point group and can be continuously turned into each other by simultaneous rotation of four sublattices .",
    "such degeneracy persists even with an extra biquadratic exchange , but the harmonic spin - wave calculations indicate that fluctuations choose the noncoplanar @xmath11 state [ ] .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to study the role of structural disorder , in particular , nonmagnetic vacancies , on degeneracy lifting for the @xmath0 pyrochlore antiferromagnet .",

    "structural disorder modifies locally exchange interactions and destroys perfect magnetic frustration at the microscopic level . as a result ,",
    "magnetic moments tilt from the equilibrium bulk structure producing spin textures [ ] and net uncompensated moments [ ] .",
    "the idea of uncompensated moments and related local magnetic fields was also used by henley in his explanation of vacancy - induced degeneracy lifting in the @xmath7@xmath8 square - lattice antiferromagnet [ ] . though simple and quite appealing , this approach can not be applied to a general problem of ` order by structural disorder ' in noncollinear frustrated magnets . indeed , local fields from vacancies on different magnetic sublattices average to zero in a macroscopic sample producing no selection .    building on the previous works [ , ] , we have recently shown that bond and site disorder generate positive biquadratic exchange [ ] .",
    "such an effective interaction is obtained by integrating out static fluctuations in a spin texture and due to its sign favors the _ least _ collinear spin configurations in degenerate frustrated magnets .",

    "another type of randomness in magnetic solids is bond disorder . in pyrochlore materials it may appear as a result of doping on the nonmagnetic @xmath131 sites .",
    "we model this type of disorder by small random variations of @xmath132 and @xmath84 : @xmath133 the fluctuating part @xmath134 is assumed to be uncorrelated between adjacent bonds and relatively small , @xmath135 , such that it does not change the sign of exchange constants .",
    "the subsequent calculation is completely similar to the previous subsection up to a substitution @xmath136 .",
    "the state - dependent energy correction has the form @xmath137    we conclude this section with the remark that a different state selection produced by structural disorder has its origin in the local breakdown of frustration .",
    "indeed , the corresponding energy correction is determined by the linear term @xmath71 , whereas thermal and quantum order from disorder stems from the quadratic part @xmath74 .",
    "technically , the two terms have different combinations of the relative angles as demonstrated by eq .",

    "thermodynamic signatures of the first - order transition appear to be blurred by disorder .",
    "the observed sequence of ordered phases remains stable under variations of @xmath125 and @xmath152 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nimp ] shows dependence on vacancy concentration for @xmath188 .",
    "we include only monte carlo results for the largest clusters with @xmath171 .",
    "the first - order transition temperature progressively grows between @xmath189 for @xmath190% to @xmath191 for @xmath192% .",
    "the order parameter jump is very sharp for the lowest impurity concentration but becomes significantly smeared for @xmath192% .",
    "we attribute this effect to a substantial finite - size scaling at large impurity concentrations .",
    "monte carlo simulations of significantly bigger clusters are required for precise determination of the transition point between the two @xmath13 states for large density of vacancies .",
    "finally , dependence on @xmath152 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ja ] .",
    "as expected , the @xmath3 state is present at low temperatures for all studied values of the anisotropic exchange including @xmath193 , which is very close to the experimental estimate for @xmath6 , see appendix  [ sec : appsgeom ] .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the thermal selection of the @xmath5 state in the vicinity of @xmath182 is also remarkably stable under variations of @xmath110 or @xmath152 .",
    "this can be considered as a consequence of the harris criterion , which asserts irrelevance of quenched disorder for transitions in the 3d @xmath0 universality class .     and different values of @xmath152 .",
    "monte carlo results are for @xmath171 clusters . ]",
    "the monte carlo results of the previous section give a general idea about competition between impurities and thermal fluctuations for the ground - state selection . beyond the classical model ,",
    "similar competition exists also for the structural disorder and quantum effects even at zero temperature .",
    "there must be a critical impurity concentration above which the quantum selection gives way to the spin configurations stabilized by vacancies .",
    "since the energy gain produced by impurity substitution is a purely classical effect , the critical impurity concentration scales with the spin length as @xmath194 .",
    "this raises a legitimate question about observability of the structural order from disorder effect in spin-1/2 frustrated magnets , in particular , in diluted @xmath6 .",
    "even an approximate calculation of @xmath195 is a fairly difficult theoretical problem . in order to treat quantum effects within the framework of the @xmath24 spin - wave expansion , one starts with setting up the holstein - primakoff transformation from spins to bosons in the local frame around a specific magnetic state .",
    "subsequent calculation of the quantum energy correction can be performed directly in the real space without a need to do the fourier transformation [ ] .",
    "then , in full analogy with sec .  [ sec : gsm ] , one can find numerically the harmonic energy correction for an impurity - induced nonuniform spin texture and average that over random impurity configurations .",
    "however , a similar computation for the competing spin configurations selected by quantum fluctuations at @xmath196 immediately fails .",
    "such states cease to be the classical ground states in the presence of impurities and , hence , have ill - defined harmonic excitation spectra .",
    "the quantum order by disorder selection is manifestly nonlinear effect in the presence of structural randomness .    here",
    ", we circumvent the difficulty of treating nonlinear quantum effects for an impurity - induced spin texture in @xmath6 , by assuming that concentration of vacancies is low .",
    "then , the quantum energy correction can be taken as that for the pure @xmath109 pyrochlore antiferromagnet ( [ q - cos6f ] ) , whereas the classical energy gain from impurities is estimated from eq .",
    "( [ cos6f ] ) by restoring the @xmath197 prefactor and substituting @xmath198 .",
    "actually , instead of the harmonic result ( [ q - cos6f ] ) we employ a more accurate expression ( [ appq - cos6f1/2 ] ) with a 40%  reduced amplitude for the sixfold harmonics due to renormalization by interaction effects . in this way",
    "we obtain a reasonably small value of the critical impurity concentration @xmath199 being only weakly dependent on the ratio of @xmath106 . for comparison ,",
    "the magnetization plateau in the heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet remains stable up to @xmath200 for @xmath109 basically meaning that the dilution effects in this case are observable only for large spins @xmath201 [ ] .",
    "undoubtedly , the above estimate is rather crude and there are good chances that the critical impurity concentration for @xmath6 is even smaller than 7% .",
    "the approximation adopted for derivation of ( [ cos6f ] ) treats only tilting of nearest - neighbor spins around a vacancy .",
    "inclusion of full - range spin relaxation in an impurity - induced magnetic texture should further increase the corresponding energy gain and , hence , reduce the critical value of @xmath110 .",
    "thus , we may conclude that quantum effects become subdominant in the anisotropic @xmath0 pyrochlore already for small dilution and there is a good prospective for an experimental observation of the impurity induced @xmath3 state in @xmath6 .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the effect of nonmagnetic dilution and weak bond disorder for the anisotropic @xmath0 pyrochlore antiferromagnet .",
    "the degeneracy lifting produced by the two types of disorder is opposite to the effect of thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "specifically , in the parameter range @xmath202 relevant for @xmath6 , the structural disorder stabilizes at zero temperature the coplanar @xmath3 magnetic structure . at finite temperatures , thermal fluctuations",
    "induce the reentrant first - order transition into the @xmath5 state .",
    "our results further confirm the striking dissimilarity between the order from disorder effects generated by fluctuations , thermal or quantum , and by frozen disorder in the spin hamiltonian parameters . in a broader prospective ,",
    "the different ground - state selection is produced by different coupling to transverse spin fluctuations and , therefore , should persists for various generalizations of the spin hamiltonian including frustrated spin - orbital models [ ] .",
    "finally , let us remark that completely unambiguous identification of the quantum order from disorder effect always meets a problem of distinguishing it from weak extra interactions like , for example , spin - lattice coupling in the case of the magnetization plateaus [ ] . on the other hand , controlled doping of nonmagnetic impurities into a frustrated magnet may provide a clear experimental evidence of the structural order from disorder phenomenon .",
    "we are grateful to r. moessner and m. vojta for fruitful discussions .",
    "in cubic pyrochlore materials , magnetic ions form a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra usually called a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the unit cell contains four magnetic sites . their positions in units of the cubic lattice parameter @xmath203 and",
    "the directions of local @xmath204 axes are given by @xmath205 the primitive lattice vectors are chosen as @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 .",

    "spin operators @xmath210 are taken in the local coordinate frame with @xmath211 and @xmath212 being projections on the local trigonal axis and on the orthogonal @xmath54 plane , respectively .",
    "being independent of the choice of @xmath57 and @xmath213 axes , this form of the hamiltonian is convenient for calculation of classical energies and for monte carlo simulations .    to describe the classical ground states of the @xmath0 pyrochlore antiferromagnet we choose directions of @xmath214 and @xmath215 axes such that they coincide with sublattice direction for the @xmath216 and the @xmath3 state , respectively : @xmath217    the spin hamiltonian used in sec .",

    "this form of the spin hamiltonian was previously employed in a number of works [ , , ] with a minor redefinition of complex factors . instead of using @xmath219 and @xmath220 , we explicitly extract phases , which greatly simplifies our subsequent expressions . for the above choice of axes we have @xmath221",
    "comparing two forms of the spin hamiltonian we obtain the following relation between two sets of exchange parameters : @xmath222    neutron measurements of magnetic excitations in @xmath6 in a high magnetic field [ ] , yield the following estimate for the exchange parameters in @xmath223  mev : @xmath224 applying ( [ jconv ] ) we obtain @xmath225 the above values confirm the planar character of the interaction between er@xmath226 moments as well as a significant anisotropy for the in - plane exchange constants @xmath227 . since transverse exchange constants @xmath228 and @xmath229 are an order of magnitude smaller , the physical properties @xmath6 can be quite accurately captured by the model with just two exchange parameters @xmath230 and @xmath152 or @xmath231 and @xmath84 used in the main text .",
    "here we provide more details on the calculation of the quantum correction ( [ q - cos6f ] ) , which selects between different classical spin configurations .",
    "the basic set up of the perturbation expansion is described in sec .",
    "iii , see eqs .",
    "( [ hkm ] ) and ( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "the ground state @xmath91 of the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath51 coincides with a classical state and corresponds to a fully - saturated state in the local basis : @xmath92 . as a result ,",
    "the perturbation series starts with the second - order correction @xmath232 due to the specific form of the perturbation @xmath233 , the intermediate excited states @xmath95 have only two spin flips on neighboring lattice sites with @xmath234 .",
    "these processes are represented by the following diagram : @xmath235 which describes creation and subsequent annihilation of a pair of spin flips on the same bond @xmath236 .",
    "the energy correction from these processes is @xmath237 absence of @xmath38-dependence in the final expression can be easily understood by noticing that @xmath238 and , consequently , @xmath239 .",
    "however , all lower - order @xmath38-harmonics are prohibited by the @xmath83 symmetry with the proper angular - dependent contribution @xmath240 arising only in the third order of the perturbation expansion .",
    "the third - order energy correction is given by the rayleigh - schrdinger expression ( [ de3 ] ) . in this order",
    ", there are two distinct excitation processes .",
    "the first one considered in the main text is represented by the triangular plaquette diagram @xmath241 the full expression of the corresponding energy correction is given by ( [ q - cos6f1 ] ) and after summation transforms into @xmath242    the scaling @xmath243 indicates that this correction is one of the terms included into the harmonic spin - wave theory .",
    "thus , we may directly compare the analytic expression ( [ appq - cos6f ] ) to the full ground - state energy correction of the harmonic spin - wave theory , which requires numerical integration of magnon energies over the brillouin zone .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : qq ] .",
    "the inset shows @xmath244 for @xmath245 and 0.5 ( data points ) from ref .",
    "and fits to @xmath246 dependence ( full lines ) .",
    "the @xmath245 data exhibit the required sixfold periodicity but noticeably deviate from a simple cosine function . on the other hand , for @xmath247 and larger ,",
    "the spin - wave data are perfectly fitted by eq .",
    "( [ ca ] ) .",
    "values of @xmath248 obtained from the fit are compared to the analytic expression ( [ appq - cos6f ] ) in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qq ] .",
    "the agreement is very good for @xmath249 signaling that accuracy of the analytic result is basically governed by a small ratio @xmath250 we have also compared the constant @xmath251 to @xmath38-independent contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ de2a ] ) and ( [ appq - cos6f ] ) and found agreement within 1525% , which is a reasonable accuracy for just two first terms of the @xmath49 expansion .",
    "( data points ) to @xmath252 angular dependence ( full lines ) .",
    "main panel : comparison of the fitted amplitude @xmath248 of the cosine function ( circles ) to the analytic expression ( solid line ) from the leading term in the harmonic expansion ( [ appq - cos6f ] ) . ]",
    "another third - order contribution is described by the diagram @xmath253 and corresponds to a single - bond process providing correction to ( [ de2a ] ) due to interaction of two spin flips generated by @xmath72 .",
    "its explicit expression is @xmath254 this energy correction also has a @xmath38-dependent part : @xmath255 the coefficient in front of the cosine function is positive providing an opposite tendency compared to @xmath256 .",
    "still , for @xmath257 and @xmath258 the total third - order correction robustly selects the @xmath5 states .",
    "however , for the case @xmath109 relevant to @xmath6 , the two angular - dependent terms cancel each other and one needs to perform a more careful analysis of the real - space perturbation terms .",
    "we present further details on that in the next appendix , though the main conclusion on the state selection by quantum fluctuations remains intact .",
    "in appendix [ appsq ] we have found that the third - order quantum correction @xmath259 resulting from interaction of two spin flips cancels the harmonic spin - wave contribution @xmath256 leaving intact the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath3 states . to treat more carefully interaction effects",
    "we adopt a modified real - space expansion based on a partial rearrangement of perturbation terms in eq .",
    "( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath72 is now included into a new unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath260 in this way the ising part of spin - flip interaction is treated exactly . basically , the new expansion corresponds to resummation of an infinite subset of terms in the original real - space approach used in sec .",
    "iii and appendix  [ appsq ] .",
    "a similar trick was also applied in ref .   for the ising expansion at the fractional magnetization plateaus .",
    "the main difference between the two forms of the real - space expansion is in assignment of excitation energies in ( [ de2 ] ) .",
    "the lowest - energy excitation , a pair of spin - flips on the same bond , costs now @xmath261 .",
    "we rewrite it as @xmath262 with @xmath263 and use @xmath264 as a small parameter .",
    "the second - order energy correction corresponds to single - bond processes and is expressed by @xmath265 keeping only the lowest - order terms up to @xmath266 and dropping all unessential constants we obtain @xmath267 for large @xmath23 this expression matches exactly with the corresponding term in @xmath259 , see ( [ appqcos6f ] ) .    in the third - order , there is only a triangular - plaquette process , which provides the energy shift @xmath268 we calculate it expanding in powers of @xmath264 as @xmath269 the first leading term again matches the angular - dependent part of the previous expression ( [ appq - cos6f ] ) .",
    "comparing now @xmath100 and @xmath270 , we do see cancellation of the leading @xmath264 terms for @xmath109 .",
    "still the coefficient in front of the cosine is negative : @xmath271 thus , for @xmath109 the quantum order by disorder selection acts in the same way as for large spins .",
