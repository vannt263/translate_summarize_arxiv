    "despite the discovery  @xcite of a 126 gev boson by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2012 , the lhc has so far been a disappointment : no new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been seen , and even the new boson appears higgs - like , i.e. as prescribed by sm .",
    "surveying the terrain , there seems one last hope for discovering new physics , namely @xmath0 .",
    "there is some motivation for enhancement , from the well known  @xcite mild ( of order 2@xmath5 ) but lingering tension between direct measurement of cp violation ( cpv ) phase of @xmath6@xmath7 mixing , versus extraction by indirect means .",
    "if an enhanced @xmath0 rate is discovered with 20112012 lhc data , the likely explanation would be a fourth generation of quarks .",
    "this would then cast doubt on the higgs boson interpretation of the 126 gev boson .",
    "the @xmath8 decay has been a highlight pursuit since tevatron times , and only recently surpassed  @xcite in sensitivity by the lhc .",
    "the drive has been the possibly huge enhancement by exotic scalar effects inspired by supersymmetry ( susy ) , but now excluded by the first evidence for sm - like rates by the lhcb experiment  @xcite . in contrast , the search for @xmath0 has not shared the limelight . this is because the sm prediction itself is 30 times lower than @xmath8 . however , the combined lhc bound is now within  @xcite a factor of 8 of the sm prediction , and one may ask whether this mode could be anywhere enhanced up to this order .",
    "as pictorialized by the  straub plot \"  @xcite and discussed recently by stone  @xcite , most models of enhancement for @xmath0 have now been eliminated by the sm - like @xmath8 rate measured by lhcb , with two exceptions .",
    "one is an old , purely left - handed susy model  @xcite .",
    "however , the region allowed by current data is but a corner of the parameter space , hence not plausible .",
    "the other would be  @xcite the 4th generation ( 4 g ) , where @xmath0 and @xmath8 decays are modulated by different cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) products @xmath9 and @xmath10 , allowing @xmath0 to be enhanced up to the current bound , even if @xmath8 is sm - like .",
    "stone has followed conventional wisdom to argue  @xcite that 4 g has been  eliminated by the higgs discovery \" , because it  would cause the higgs production cross - section to be nine times larger  \"  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a comprehensive analysis  @xcite including electroweak and flavor observables plus earlier higgs production data already ruled out 4 g in sm framework .",
    "there are two catches in this pessimism , however .",
    "first of all , it is not yet established that the observed 126 gev object is the higgs boson of sm .",
    "for example , a dilaton might mimic  @xcite the higgs with current data .",
    "second , the higgs boson of sm does not enter into the @xmath0 process ( the same holds for the @xmath7 box diagram and @xmath11 processes we consider ) . to assume indirect arguments in the flavor pursuit",
    "is self - defeating , especially when there is still room for large enhancement ; it actually highlights the potential impact of a discovery .",
    "it was shown  @xcite recently , through an empirical gap equation  @xcite , that dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking ( dewsb ) could occur through strong yukawa coupling of 4 g quarks .",
    "although there is no account for how a dilaton actually emerges , the scale invariance of this gap equation allows for a dilaton to appear .",
    "the dilaton possibility can be checked experimentally through the absence , or suppression , of vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and associated production ( vh ) processes , which requires more data than currently available .",
    "the very large yukawa coupling needed for dewsb is consistent with not finding the 4 g quarks so far , where the current bounds  @xcite are already above the nominal  @xcite unitarity bound ( ub ) .",
    "thus , the numerical study we present below is only meant as an illustration .    in the following ,",
    "we review input parameters and constraints , then present our numerical study .",
    "we indeed find enhancement beyond @xmath12 ( 4 times sm ) is possible  @xcite within the parameter space indicated by the known tension in @xmath13 .",
    "we give an assessment of immediate and longer term prospects .",
    "there is no indication for new physics in @xmath14 transitions at present .",
    "the best probe is @xmath15 measurement pursued by lhcb , where @xmath16 is defined as the cpv phase in the @xmath17 mixing amplitude ( hence @xmath18 ) .",
    "this definition is consistent with @xmath19 used by the b factories .",
    "the 4 g @xmath20 quark could have easily affected many @xmath14 processes  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these , including @xmath21 transition effects , can be tuned away or softened by a small @xmath22 strength , which is demanded by @xmath15 being consistent with sm expectations and is yet to be measured .",
    "as illustrated by the straub plot  @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can vary independently from each other , i.e. through @xmath9 and @xmath10 , subject to constraint from kaon physics ( affected by @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is well known  @xcite , however , that there is some tension between the directly measured value  @xcite of @xmath26 and sm expectation via @xmath27 , where  @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the terms on right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be measured at the tree level .",
    "currently  @xcite , @xmath30 and we take the central values @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "variations in these values are not central to our discussion .    in contrast",
    ", @xmath34 also has some tension in the measured values .",
    "extraction via inclusive or exclusive semileptonic @xmath35 decays yield approximately @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite , respectively , with the average value of @xmath38 ( the inclusive approach has better statistics ) .",
    "we use central values , as our purpose is only for illustration , hence we will treat the average ( which is close to inclusive ) and exclusive cases separately .    although the strength of @xmath39 is not sensitive to @xmath34 ,",
    "the phase is sensitive to its value , @xmath40 which both deviate from eq .",
    "( 1 ) by more than 2@xmath5 ( the inclusive value of 0.81 deviates even more ) .",
    "this deviation offers some motivation for new physics in @xmath3 transitions",
    ". it could easily be due to the 4 g quark @xmath20 , where one simply augments eq .",
    "( 2 ) by @xmath41 and the @xmath42 triangle becomes a quadrangle @xmath43 in our following study , we parameterize  @xcite @xmath44 in our phase convention , @xmath45 is practically real , while @xmath46 is basically the same as in sm .    to study @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the @xmath49@xmath50 plane ,",
    "other constraints should be considered :    * radiative @xmath51 processes ( including @xmath52 ) is ineffective because it is hard to separate from @xmath53 , difficult to study with lhcb , and in any case insensitive to virtual 4 g effects ; * @xmath54 decays , while quite well studied , suffers from hadronic effects ( even @xmath55 suffers from hadronic effects ) , and do not provide good constraints ; * the well measured @xmath56 provides a constraint through uncertainties in @xmath57 ; * only very recently was the electroweak penguin @xmath58 decay measured  @xcite , in contrast to electroweak @xmath14 penguins .",
    "although it may be a little surprising , there are not many observables that provide sound constraints on @xmath59 .",
    "we collect below the relevant formulas for our study .    the @xmath20 effect",
    "to @xmath7 mixing @xmath60 is ( explicit forms can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "besides 4 g parameters , the main uncertainty is in  @xcite @xmath63                for the current bound  @xcite of @xmath64 our purpose is to illustrate whether , and how , it could get enhanced to such values by 4 g effect . here , we use the usual trick @xcite of  normalizing \" the branching ratio , @xmath65 where @xmath66 with @xmath67 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath68 through the ratio of eq .",
    "( 14 ) , one not only eliminates the hadronic parameter @xmath69 , but the @xmath70 factor also cancels in the sm case , and one recovers the sm result of @xmath71 , with little sensitivity to @xmath34 .    the treatment of @xmath58 would be given in the next section .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "1 for @xmath72 gev the 2@xmath5 range in the @xmath49@xmath50 plane , for @xmath47 ( green ) allowed  @xcite by experimental measurement of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath56 ( pink ) allowed by lattice error in eq .  ( 12 ) , and the bound on @xmath73 ( gray exclusion ) according to eq .  ( 13 ) .",
    "we include labeled contours of 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 for @xmath74 .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) are for taking @xmath34 to be the central values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 , respectively , for the mean ( between inclusive and exclusive ) and exclusive values from semileptonic @xmath35 decay studies .",
    "consider fig .",
    "1(a ) , i.e. for @xmath75 , the average between inclusive and exclusive measurements ( the inclusive case is qualitatively similar ) .",
    "the well measured cp phase @xmath47 is sensitive to @xmath20 effects , but free from hadronic uncertainties , hence the narrow ( green ) contour bands .",
    "in contrast , @xmath56 is less sensitive to @xmath50 , and more accommodating because of hadronic uncertainty in @xmath76 .",
    "the broad ( pink ) contour bands show the 1 and 2@xmath5 allowed region by eq .",
    "( 12 ) , and rules out a branch of the @xmath47 contour ( for @xmath50 between @xmath77 to @xmath78 ) , due to coherent enhancement of @xmath56 from @xmath20 effects .",
    "consider now the gray excluded region from the combined lhc bound on @xmath79 , eq .",
    "it is seen that there are two slivers of parameter space , around @xmath80 ( region a ) and @xmath81 ( region b ) , where @xmath82 could be above @xmath83 , or enhanced by 4 times over sm , which are discovery zones for 2011 - 2012 lhc data . near region",
    "b , @xmath82 quickly drops below @xmath83 as @xmath49 becomes weaker than 0.002 . for @xmath84 and @xmath49 varying from 0.0008 to 0.0015 , @xmath82 hovers at ( 12)@xmath2 , while for @xmath85 to 0.0008 and @xmath50 varying from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , @xmath82 hovers at ( 0.52)@xmath2 , i.e. within a factor of two of sm expectations . these regions , combining to a broad crescent shape which we refer to as  region c \" , would likely need much more data to probe .",
    "the lhcb experiment has recently measured  @xcite @xmath88 which is the rarest @xmath35 decay observed to date .",
    "the result is consistent with sm expectations , but interpretation depends on form factor models . to reduce form factor dependence , we take the ratio @xmath89 where both 4 g and sm results are integrated from @xmath90 , which is under better numerical control  @xcite .",
    "since this does not match what lhcb does , we draw contours in fig .  2 ( red - dashed ) , and view @xmath913 as the range beyond which lhcb would have found inconsistency with sm expectations .",
    "thus , we are interpreting lhcb s statement of consistency with sm , allowing for form factor uncertainties .",
    "it is clear that this approach is not as good as the zero crossing point @xmath92 for @xmath93 , but this is the first observation of rare @xmath94 decays , compared to the decade - long exploration of @xmath95 processes . for numerics ,",
    "we combine wilson coefficients at next - to - leading order with leading order decay amplitude based on the qcd factorization approach @xcite . for dealing with new physics , and as we take a ratio , this should suffice for our purpose .    if we now compared fig .",
    "1(a ) with fig .",
    "2(a ) , we see that @xmath56 is more powerful than @xmath96 in excluding the @xmath47-allowed branch near @xmath97 .",
    "this is reasonable , since @xmath58 is only recently observed and prone to hadronic form factor uncertainties , while @xmath56 has been measured since 25 years , with hadronic uncertainty narrowed down to @xmath76 , which itself has been subject to intense lattice studies for years .",
    "it is , however , comforting to see that for region a , @xmath98 is not more than 2 ( except the upper reach near @xmath99 ) , hence should be easy to accommodate by form factors , while for regions b and especially region c , @xmath98 is even less than 2 and closer to 1 .",
    "thus , the newly measured @xmath58 does provide a sanity check .    turning to the case of exclusive @xmath34 value , fig .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) , we find that regions a and b basically switch roles .",
    "this is because for @xmath100 , the expected @xmath47 value in sm falls below that of direct measurement , as seen in comparing eq .  ( 4 ) to eq .",
    "calling it region a@xmath101 , the sliver of region around @xmath102 could enhance @xmath82 more than 4 times above sm , and observable with present lhc data .",
    "region a@xmath101 extends to the broad crescent region c@xmath101 , where even @xmath49 values as lower as 0.0002 could account for the measured @xmath47 , but @xmath82 can be probed only beyond 2015 .",
    "again , @xmath56 excludes the @xmath47-allowed branch around @xmath103 .",
    "region b@xmath101 is now a considerably broader region in parameter space that allows enhancement of @xmath82 above @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for @xmath49 above 0.0023 and @xmath50 above 230@xmath104 , @xmath82 can be greater than @xmath105 , @xmath76 is within 2@xmath5 of eq .",
    "( 12 ) , while @xmath98 is not more than 2 .",
    "we also see that , for region b@xmath101 , @xmath98 provides as good , perhaps better constraint , than @xmath56 , disfavoring the region of @xmath49 greater than 0.0025 around @xmath106 , that seems perfectly allowed by @xmath56 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath4 values .",
    "the 700 gev value used so far is just above current experimental limits  @xcite , and correspond to yukawa coupling strength @xmath107 , or @xmath108 , which is why there is ub violation ( ubv ) .",
    "however , we do not quite know what is the true expansion parameter .",
    "furthermore , even if perturbation breaks down , it does not mean there is no @xmath20 effect .",
    "in fact , perturbation in @xmath59 certainly holds , though the functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 in eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 14 ) gets modified by ubv effects .",
    "the overall form of these equations should not change .",
    "we therefore consider the @xmath111 gev case , i.e. @xmath112 , to illustrate the situation far beyond ubv  @xcite .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite finds dewsb occurs for @xmath113 ( the 4 g doublet is treated as very close to degenerate ) of order @xmath114 , i.e. of order the @xmath115 coupling , implying 4 g quark masses no less than 2 tev !    the plots corresponding to figs .  1 and 2 , but with @xmath111 gev ,",
    "are given in figs .",
    "we generally see reduced @xmath49 values .",
    "region a is now excluded , but regions b , a@xmath101 and b@xmath101 become more robust in @xmath56 , but values for @xmath82 higher than ( 56)@xmath2 are slightly disfavored by @xmath58 . viewed differently , if enhanced @xmath79 is discovered , one may try to scrutinize whether @xmath58 is also somewhat enhanced beyond sm .",
    "regions c and c@xmath101 generally stand well , with at best mildly enhanced @xmath79 .",
    "we started with the question of what could still enhance @xmath79 decay , when everything at the lhc seems consistent with sm .",
    "the answer is that , probably only the 4 g @xmath20 quark could do the job , even if 4 g seems disfavored by the higgs - like nature of the 126 gev boson . admittedly , even if 4 g is the explanation for the @xmath47 tension as seen by the b factories , to have @xmath82 to be within a factor of 2 of the current bound of @xmath116 is only a fraction of the allowed parameter space , hence not particularly likely .",
    "however , only with such enhancement is there any chance for lhc experiments to make the discovery with 2011 - 2012 data , and discovery it indeed will be . if discovered  within 2013  then not only 4 g would get uplifted , some doubt would be cast on the sm higgs nature of the 126 gev boson , while  impostors \" such as dilaton would gain in weight .",
    "we have remarked in the introduction that it would take the establishment of vbf and vh production processes to exclude the dilaton possibility , which can not be achieved with 2011 - 2012 data  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing outcome of discovering @xmath79 decay would be that , all of a sudden , the @xmath42 triangle falls into our lap !",
    "let us illustrate .",
    "since @xmath111 gev cases have smaller @xmath117 values , for reasons of plotting , we take two examples from @xmath72 gev . from region",
    "a of fig .",
    "1(a ) ( average @xmath118 ) , we take @xmath119 . from region",
    "b of fig .",
    "1(b ) ( exclusive @xmath120 ) , we take @xmath121 .    the quadrangle of eq .",
    "( 6 ) is constructed as follows . to simplify discussions ,",
    "we normalize to @xmath122 , which becomes a unit vector pointing left .",
    "then , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , respectively , for the average and inclusive cases , with corresponding @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath127 just connects the tip of @xmath128 with the end of @xmath129 .",
    "the two examples for 700 gev are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdquad ] in the form to compare with the usual sm triangle  @xcite .",
    "these are relatively precise quadrangles , and illustrate how 4 g accounts for a shift in @xmath47 away from sm expectation , where @xmath130 is the angle between the dashed line , @xmath70 and the real axis . since @xmath20 is much heavier than @xmath131 , a smaller @xmath59 could cause the shift .    the sample @xmath42 quadrangles are for largest allowed solutions for @xmath49 , i.e. regions a ( for @xmath132 ) and b@xmath101 ( for @xmath133 ) for @xmath72 gev , and would be the case if @xmath79 is discovered soon .",
    "they are relatively extreme , however , since even for @xmath72 gev , regions c and c@xmath101 can provide solutions for @xmath47 for much smaller @xmath134 values , with possible phase values extending over a large range . for heavier @xmath20 illustrated by 1000 gev , @xmath135 is smaller by half compared to 700 gev case , with region a is eliminated .    the quadrangles of fig .  [",
    "fig : bdquad ] reminds us of the possible  @xcite link to the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) : 4 g greatly enhances cpv from sm , and is seemingly sufficient for bau ( although a first order phase transition remains an issue ) , which boosts the merit of 4 g . it does not depend much on the area of the quadrangle , as the enhancement rests in powers of @xmath4 and @xmath136 .",
    "we note that @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdquad ] , though smaller in strength than @xmath137 and @xmath138 , is not that small compared with @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , we know that @xmath140 can not be more than 0.1  @xcite , especially for our large @xmath4 values . hence , @xmath141 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdquad ] correspond to @xmath142 that is larger than @xmath143 , which does not fit the ckm pattern of trickling off as one goes further off - diagonal .",
    "one could use this to argue that enhanced @xmath79 decay to the level observable with 2011 - 2012 data is not plausible .",
    "however , the issue is best left to experiment .    for @xmath111 gev",
    ", @xmath141 values tend to drop by half , but @xmath142 would still be comparable to @xmath144 . only if one gives up enhancement would the ratio @xmath145 turn  natural \" .",
    "in fact , for the exclusive value case for @xmath146 , @xmath141 ( i.e. @xmath49 ) could be ( 12)@xmath147 and still account for @xmath47  anomaly \" .",
    "such values for @xmath142 would become  natural \" when compared with @xmath144 .",
    "however , even if 4 g gains support by 2015 , this region ( c and c@xmath101 ) would need a very large data set to explore .",
    "we conclude that 2013 remains a pivotal year where one could discover the very rare @xmath79 decay mode at over 4 times sm expectations .",
    "the chance is not large , but not zero either , with partial motivation from the ( mild ) @xmath47 discrepancy .",
    "if discovered with 2011 - 2012 data set , the implications would be quite huge : uplifting the 4th generation ( with prospect of cpv for bau ) , casting some doubt on the sm higgs interpretation of the 126 gev boson , and perhaps the only new physics ( at least in flavor sector ) uncovered at the 7 and 8 tev runs at the lhc .",
    "but it is more likely that the lhc would once again push the limits down towards sm .",
    "if such is the case , the fate of the 4 g would have to be determined elsewhere .",
    "but @xmath79 should certainly be pursued further at the 13 tev run .",
