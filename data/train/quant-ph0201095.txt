    "the ultimate objective of this paper is to create a stepping stone to the development of new quantum algorithms .",
    "the strategy chosen is to begin by focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms ( qhsas ) , i.e. , the class of abelian algorithms of the shor / simon genre .",
    "our strategy is to make this class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible .  by the phrase `` mathematically transparent , ''",
    "we mean to expose , to bring to the surface , and to make explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently and fundamentally a part of such algorithms .",
    "in so doing , we create a class of symbolic abelian qhsas that are analogous to those symbolic algorithms found within such software packages as axiom , cayley , magma , maple , and mathematica .    during this mathematical analysis ,",
    "the differences between the simon and shor quantum algorithms become dramatically apparent .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that these two share a common ancestor , namely , the quantum random group character generator qrand , described herein .  while the simon algorithm is a qhsa on finite abelian groups which produces random characters of the hidden quotient group ,  the shor algorithm is a qhsa on free abelian finite rank groups which produces random characters of a group which `` approximate '' the hidden quotient group .",
    "it is misleading , and a frequent cause of much confusion in the open literature , to call them both essentially the same qhsa .",
    "surprisingly , these two very different algorithms touch an amazing array of different mathematical disciplines , from the obvious to the not - so - obvious , requiring the integration of many diverse fields of mathematics .",
    "shor s quantum factoring algorithm , for example , depends heavily on the interplay of two metrics on the unit circle @xmath10 , namely the arclength metric arc@xmath11 and the chordal metric chord@xmath11 .",
    "this observation greatly simplifies the analysis of the shor factoring algorithm , while at the same time revealing more of the structure concealed within the algorithm .    as a spin - off of this effort",
    ", we create three different generalizations of shor s quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank , found in sections [ vintagesummary ] and [ alternate1 ] .",
    "we refer to these algorithms as wandering ( or vintage @xmath12 ) shor algorithms .",
    "they are essentially qhsas on free abelian finite rank @xmath2 groups @xmath1 which , with each iteration , first select a random cyclic direct summand @xmath3 of the group @xmath1 and then apply one iteration of the standard shor algorithm to produce a random character of the `` approximating '' finite group @xmath13 , called a group probe .",
    "these algorithms find either the order @xmath5 of a maximal cyclic subgroup @xmath6 of the hidden quotient group @xmath7 , or the entire hidden quotient group @xmath7 .",
    "an integral part of these wandering algorithms is the selection of a very special random transversal @xmath8 , which we refer to as a shor transversal .",
    "the algorithmic time complexity of the first of these wandering ( or vintage @xmath12 ) algorithms is found in theorem [ zcomplexity ] of section [ complexitysection ] to be @xmath14 , where @xmath2 denotes the fixed finite rank of the free abelian group @xmath1 .",
    "theorem [ zcomplexity ] is based on the assumptions also found in section [ complexitysection ] .",
    "this asymptotic bound is by no means the tightest possible .    throughout this paper",
    ", it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the class of quantum hidden subgroup algorithms .  for an introductions to this subject",
    ", please refer , for example , to any one of the references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses , in particular , on the abelian hidden subgroup problem ( hsp ) , with eye toward future work by the authors on the non - abelian hsp .",
    "there is a great deal of literature on the abelian hsp , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .  for literature on the non - abelian hidden subgroup problem ,",

    "as an example of what we would like to make mathematically transparent , consider the following instance of peter shor s quantum factoring algorithm .  a great part of this paper is devoted to exposing and bringing to the surface the many concealed mathematical structures that are inherently and fundamentally part of this example .",
    "perhaps you see them ?  perhaps you find them to be self evident ?  if you do , then you need read no more of this paper , although you are most certainly welcome to read on .",
    "if , on the other hand , the following example leaves you with a restless , uneasy feeling of not fully understanding what is really going on ( i.e. , of not fully understanding what concealed mathematical structures are lurking underneath these calculations ) , then you are invited to read the remainder of this paper .",
    "peter shor s quantum factoring algorithm reduces the task of factoring a positive integer @xmath15 to first finding a random integer @xmath16 relatively prime to @xmath15 , and then next to determining the period @xmath5 of the following function @xmath17{ccl}\\mathbb{z } & \\overset{\\varphi}{\\longrightarrow } & \\mathbb{z}\\operatorname{mod}n\\\\ x & \\longmapsto & a^{x}\\operatorname{mod}n\\text { , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes the additive group of integers , and where @xmath18 denotes the integers @xmath19 under multiplication with @xmath20 is found by selecting a random integer , and then applying the euclidean algorithm to determine whether or not it is relatively prime to @xmath15 .",
    "if not , then the @xmath21 is a non - trivial factor of @xmath15 , and there is no need to proceed futher .",
    "however , this possibility is highly unlikely if @xmath15 is large . ] .",
    "since @xmath3 is an infinite group , shor chooses to work instead with the finite additive cyclic group @xmath12 of order @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and with the `` approximating '' map @xmath17{ccll}\\mathbb{z}_{q } & \\overset{\\widetilde{\\varphi}}{\\longrightarrow } & \\mathbb{z}\\operatorname{mod}n & \\\\ x & \\longmapsto & a^{x}\\operatorname{mod}n\\text { , } & 0\\leq x < q \\end{array}\\ ] ]    shor begins by constructing a quantum system with two quantum registers @xmath24 the left intended to hold the arguments @xmath25 of @xmath26 , the right to hold the corresponding values of @xmath26 .",
    "this quantum system has been constructed with a unitary transformation @xmath27 implementing the `` approximating '' map @xmath26 .    as an example , let us use shor s algorithm to factor the enormous  integer @xmath28 , assuming that @xmath29 has been randomly chosen .",
    "thus , @xmath30 .",
    "unknown to peter shor , the period is @xmath31 , and hence , @xmath32",
    ".     shor proceeds by executing the following steps :    * initialize@xmath33 * apply the fourier transform @xmath34 to the left register , where @xmath35 is a primitive @xmath36-th root of unity , to obtain @xmath37 * apply the unitary transformation @xmath38 to obtain @xmath39 * once again apply the fourier transform @xmath40 to the left register to obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 * measure the left register .",
    "then with probability @xmath43 the state will `` collapse '' to @xmath44 with the value measured being the integer @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath48 but the order of @xmath29 modulo @xmath49 is @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath31 is the smallest positive integer such that @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the above expression becomes @xmath51 since the kets @xmath52 are all distinct , we have @xmath53 after a little algebraic manipulation , we finally have the following expression for @xmath47 : @xmath54{cc}\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left (   \\frac{\\pi y}{128}\\right )   + 2\\sin^{2}\\left (   \\frac{\\pi y}{256}\\right )   } { \\left (   131072\\right )   \\sin^{2}\\left (   \\frac{3\\pi y}{256}\\right )   } & \\text{if } y\\neq0\\text { or } 256\\\\ & \\\\ \\frac{10923}{65536 } & \\text{if } y=0\\text { or } 256 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] a plot of @xmath47 is shown in figure 1",

    "*    the peaks in the above plot of @xmath47 occur at the integers @xmath56 the probability that at least one of these six integers will occur is quite high .",
    "it is actually @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the probability distribution has been intentionally engineered to make the probability of these particular integers as high as possible .",
    "and there is a good reason for doing so .",
    "the above six integers are those for which the corresponding rational @xmath58 is `` closest '' to a rational of the form @xmath59 .  by `` closest '' we mean that @xmath60 in particular , @xmath61 are rationals respectively `` closest '' to the rationals @xmath62 so by theorem [ cfconvergent ] of appendix a , the six rational numbers @xmath63 are convergents of the continued fraction expansions of @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "hence , each of the six rationals @xmath63 can be found with the recursion given in appendix a.    but ... , we are not searching for rationals of the form @xmath59 .  instead",
    ", we seek only the denominator @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , the denominator @xmath31 can only be gotten from the continued fraction recursion when the numerator and denominator of @xmath59 are relatively prime .",
    "given that the algorithm has selected one of the random integers @xmath65 , the probability that the corresponding rational @xmath59 has relatively prime numerator and denominator is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the euler totient function .",
    "so the probability of finding @xmath31 is actually not @xmath57 , but is instead @xmath68 .    from peter shor",
    "s perspective , the expression for the probability distribution is not known , since the period @xmath5 is not known .",
    "all that peter sees is a random integer @xmath45 produced by the probability distribution @xmath69 .",
    "however , he does know an approximate lower bound for the probability that the random @xmath45 produced by @xmath70 is a `` closest '' one , namely the approximate lower bound @xmath71 .  also , because @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes euler s constant , he knows that @xmath74 hence , if he repeats the algorithm @xmath75 times , he will obtain one of the desired integers @xmath45 with probability bounded below by approximately @xmath76 .    however , once he has in his possession a candidate @xmath77 for the actual period @xmath31 , the only way he can be sure he has the correct period @xmath5 is to test @xmath77 by computing @xmath78 .",
    "if the result is @xmath79 , he is certain he has found the correct period @xmath5 .",
    "this last part of the computation is done by the repeated squaring algorithm via the expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the radix 2 expansion of @xmath77 . ] .",
