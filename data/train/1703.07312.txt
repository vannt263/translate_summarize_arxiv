    "given a system dynamics , control and/or state constraints , and a database @xmath0 of feasible state - control trajectories @xmath1 from several initial states ( and different initial times ) @xmath2 , the _ inverse optimal control problem _ ( iocp ) consists of computing a lagrangian @xmath3 such that each trajectory of the database @xmath0 is an optimal solution of the ( direct ) optimal control problem ( ocp ) for the cost functional @xmath4 to minimize . even though it is an interesting problem on its own , it is also of primary importance in humanoid robotics where one tries to understand human locomotion .",
    "in fact whether or not human locomotion obeys some optimization principle is an open issue , discussed for instance in several contributions in @xcite .    as most interesting inverse problems , the ( iocp )",
    "is in general an ill - conditioned and ill - posed problem .",
    "for instance , for a source of ill - posedness , consider an ( ocp ) with terminal state constraint @xmath5 and with lagrangian @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath6\\to\\r$ ] be its associated optimal value function and let @xmath7 be a continuously differentiable function such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 . if the couple @xmath10 is an optimal solution of the ( ocp ) then it is also an optimal solution of the ( ocp ) with new lagrangian @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the vector field of the dynamics ) and the optimal value function associated with the new ( ocp ) is @xmath13 .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a discussion . therefore in full generality , recovering a lagrangian that has an intrinsic physical meaning might well be searching for a needle in a haystack .",
    "this is perhaps why previous works have considered the ( iocp ) with restrictive assumptions on the class of lagrangian to recover .",
    "some restrictions are also more technical and motivated by simplifying the search process .    in the recent work @xcite",
    "the authors have proposed to consider the ( iocp ) in relatively general framework . in this framework",
    "@xmath14-optimality certificate _ for the trajectories in the database @xmath0 translates into natural  positivity constraints \" on the unknown optimal value function @xmath15 and lagrangian @xmath3 , in a _ relaxed version _ of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations .",
    "moreover some natural normalizing constraint allows to avoid the source of ill - posedness alluded to above .",
    "then the ( iocp ) is posed as a _ polynomial optimization _ problem and solved via a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations indexed by @xmath16 , where the unknown is a couple @xmath17 of polynomials of potentially large degree @xmath18 ; for more details the reader is referred to @xcite .    in the cost criterion @xmath19",
    ", the regularizing parameter @xmath20 controls the tradeoff between minimizing @xmath14 and minimizing the sparsity - inducing @xmath21-norm @xmath22 of the lagrangian .",
    "( one assumes that a lagrangian @xmath3 with a physical meaning will have a sparse polynomial approximation . ) in some examples treated in @xcite one clearly sees the importance of @xmath23 to recover a sparse meaningful lagrangian ; the larger is @xmath23 the sparser is the lagrangian ( but at the cost of a larger @xmath14 , due to a limited computing capacity ) .      as in @xcite",
    "the approach in this paper is based on the relaxed - hjb framework to state an @xmath14-optimality certificate for the trajectories in the database @xmath0 . indeed as already mentioned in @xcite , hjb - optimality equations",
    "is the  perfect tool \" to certify global optimality of a given trajectory ( bellman optimality principle is sometimes called a _ verification _ theorem ) . on the other hand , instead of searching for @xmath3 as a polynomial of potentially large degree as in @xcite , we now restrict the search of @xmath3 to some _ dictionary _ which is a family of polynomials of low degree ( for instance convex quadratic ) . in this respect",
    "we also follow other previous approaches ( e.g. @xcite ) which impose restrictive assumptions on the lagrangian .",
    "a normalizing condition on @xmath3 avoids some previously mentioned ill - posedness and in principle no regularizing parameter @xmath23 is needed ( that is , one only minimizes @xmath14 which appears in the @xmath14-optimality certificate ) .",
    "finally , and again as in @xcite , the ( iocp ) is solved by a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations .",
    "the quality of the solution improves in the hierarchy but of course at a higher computational cost .    to compare this approach with that of @xcite",
    "we have considered four optimal control problems ( of modest size ) : the lqg , the brockett double integrator , and two minimum - time problems .",
    "in all cases we obtain better results as the lagrangian @xmath3 is recovered exactly at a semidefinite relaxation of relatively low order the hierarchy .",
    "in particular no regularizing parameter @xmath23 is needed . at last but not least",
    ", a by - product of the approach is to also provide a means to detect whether the _ dictionary _ of possible lagrangian is large enough . indeed",
    "if the resulting optimal value @xmath24 remains relatively _ high _ after several semidefinite relaxations , one may probably infer that the dictionary is too small to contain a good lagrangian .    in section",
    "ii we define the ( iocp ) while the relaxed hamilton - jacobi - bellman optimality conditions are presented in section iii ( with some discussion on the ill - posedness of the problem ) .",
