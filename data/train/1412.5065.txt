    "the evaluation of wireless communications systems commonly resorts to the use of simplified channel models , with the purpose of simplifying the analytical formulation of the associated system model . while simplified channel models are more tractable , they can easily lead to inaccurate results and consequent wrong conclusions .",
    "a concrete example is the case of cell - splitting in cellular networks , where the network performance has been assessed using a single slope path loss model . by considering this model",
    ", it has been shown that the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) increases linearly with the base station ( bs ) deployment density , whereas the outage probability is independent of the bs density  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the energy efficiency turns out to be a monotonic increasing function of the cell density @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , when the assumption of single slope path - loss is dropped and different path - loss models are used , those aforementioned properties do no longer hold @xcite .",
    "although the results obtained with single slope path loss can be considered reliable if the bs density is within a limited range of values , the same might not be true if one needs to extend this result to a wider bs density range .",
    "therefore , as the trend of future networks is shifting towards ultra dense base station deployment  @xcite , it becomes important to re - evaluate the performance of these network deployments using more accurate channel models .",
    "a well - known stochastic geometry framework for wireless cellular networks can be found in  @xcite ; by assuming a single slope path loss model , the authors have observed the independence of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) and spectral efficiency ( se ) from the bs deployment density , where the main consequence is the linear dependence of the ase on the deployment density .    in some recent work , the effect of cell densification while assuming different models than single slope has been considered . for instance , in  @xcite it was shown that by using a combined line - of - sight ( los)/non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) path loss model the ase becomes superlinear at low densities and sublinear at high densities .",
    "however that work was based on a simulation study , lacking an analytical framework to back the reached conclusions .    in  @xcite",
    ", the authors have studied the non - linear behaviour of the ase with the deployment density in indoor scenarios , and have included an exponential component in the path loss to account for the wall attenuation . as a result ,",
    "the ase was shown to scale as @xmath0 with the number @xmath1 of cells .    in  @xcite",
    ", the authors extended the stochastic geometry framework proposed in  @xcite to a multi - slope path loss model .",
    "they focused their analysis on a dual - slope propagation model that considers two propagation regimes , namely the near - field and the far - field , with different attenuation exponents .",
    "the proposed model is particularly suitable for millimeter wave communications , but is essentially different from the one proposed by 3gpp  @xcite for the assessment of heterogeneous networks in lower frequency bands ( e.g. , 2 ghz ) .",
    "finally , the effect of nlos propagation on the outage probability has been studied in  @xcite , where the authors propose a function that gives the probability to have los at a given point depending on the distance from the source , on the average size of the buildings , and on the density of the buildings per area .",
    "although it allowed the authors to show the dependence of the outage probability on the density of base stations and of the density of buildings per area , the propagation model proposed in  @xcite lacks a validation based on a measurement campaign with real data .      in this paper , we focus on a dense network of small cells where the signal propagation considers a path loss model with los and nlos components , and we use stochastic geometry tools to evaluate common performance metrics ( such as coverage / outage probability , se and ase ) as a function of the base station deployment density .",
    "specifically , we consider the propagation model provided by 3gpp for heterogeneous networks at 2 ghz , as we believe this is a reliable model for the performance evaluation of small - cells and dense networks . our contribution is threefold : ( i ) we propose a tractable model for the los probability function which well fits the 3gpp model and , at the same time , it enables the study of the performance depending on the los likelihood of the environment ; ( ii ) we derive a stochastic geometry framework that incorporates the proposed los probability function ; finally ( iii ) we study the optimal base station deployment density in terms of the common performance metrics according to the los likelihood or , equivalently , the sparsity of the propagation environment .",
    "in particular , we show that in sparser environments characterized by high probability of los , the optimal base station density in terms of the lowest outage and the highest spectral efficiency is achieved at lower values of base station density and vice - versa .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : systemmodel ] we describe the system model .",
    "we show our formulation for computing the sinr , se and ase in section  [ sect : sinr_se_ase ] . in section  [",
    "sect : results ] we present and discuss the results while the conclusions are drawn in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we consider a network of small - cell base stations deployed according to a homogeneous and isotropic spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) , denoted as @xmath2 , and of intensity @xmath3 .",
    "further , we assume that each base station ( bs ) transmits with the same power @xmath4 , and we focus our analysis on the downlink .",
    "finally , we assume the users to be deployed uniformly over the considered area and that each bs serves at least one user and has full buffer traffic .      in our analysis",
    ", we considered the following path loss model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table a.2.1.1.2 - 3 ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the path - loss exponents for los and nlos propagation , respectively ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the signal attenuations at distance @xmath10 for los and nlos propagation , and @xmath9 can either refer to the signal attenuations at distance @xmath10 m or @xmath10 km ; this depends on the actual values given for the parameters of the channel model .",
    "] respectively ; @xmath11 is the probability of having los as a function of the distance @xmath12 .",
    "we further assume that the propagation is affected by rayleigh fading , which is exponentially distributed @xmath13 .    the incorporation of the nlos component in the path loss model accounts for possible obstructions of the signal due to large scale objects ( e.g. buildings ) , which will result in a higher attenuation of the nlos propagation compared to the los path .      in our study , we refer first to the los probability function proposed by 3gpp  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table a.2.1.1.2 - 3 ) to assess the network performance in scenarios with pico - cells deployment ; this function is the following : @xmath14 unfortunately , this function would not be practical for an analytical formulation .",
    "therefore , we chose to approximate it with a more tractable one , namely , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a parameter that allows   to be tuned to match  , as we will show later on . from a physical stand point",
    ", this parameter @xmath16 can be interpreted as the los likelihood of a given propagation environment as a function of the distance .",
    "consider the following motivating example : this could be associated to the density of large scale obstructing objects in the propagation environment .",
    "the larger @xmath16 is , the sparser the environment will be and consequently the higher the probability to have los at a given distance from the point of interest and vice - versa . in our study , we will make use of this parameter to analyze the effect of different los propagation environments on the network performance .",
    "in this section we propose an analytical model to compute the sinr cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and the ase of a network where the path - loss includes both line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) components .      in order to compute the sinr complementary cdf ( ccdf )",
    ", we extend the analytical framework first proposed in  @xcite to include the los and nlos components . from the slivnyak s theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.10 ) , we consider the  _ typical user _ as the focus of our analysis , which for convenience is assumed to be located at the origin .",
    "the procedure is composed of two steps : ( i ) we compute the sinr ccdf for the typical user conditioned on the distance from the user to the serving base station , denoted as @xmath17 ; ( ii ) using the pdf @xmath18 of the distance from the user to the serving bs , we can average the sinr ccdf over all possible values of distance @xmath17 .",
    "let us denote the sinr by @xmath19 ; formally , the ccdf of @xmath19 is computed as : @xmath20&=\\mathrm{e_{r}}\\big[\\mathrm{p}\\left[\\gamma > y|r\\right]\\big ] \\\\",

    "the methodology to compute each of these elements while modelling the los and nlos path loss components will be exposed next .",
    "the set of the base stations locations originates an sppp , which we denote by @xmath23 . and use @xmath24 and instead of @xmath25 for convenience of notation .",
    "] we recall that the focus of our analysis is the typical user located at the origin . as a result of the propagation model we have adopted in our analysis ( see section  [ subsect : channelmodel ] ) , the user can either be in los or nlos with any base station @xmath25 of @xmath26 .",
    "now , we perform the following mapping : we first define the set of los points , namely @xmath27 , and the set of nlos points , @xmath28 .",
    "then , each point @xmath25 of @xmath26 is mapped into @xmath27 if the base station at location @xmath25 is in los with the user , while it is mapped into @xmath28 if the base station at location @xmath25 is in nlos with the user . since the probability that @xmath25 is in los with the user is @xmath29",
    ", it follows that each point @xmath25 of @xmath26 is mapped with probability @xmath29 into @xmath27 and probability @xmath30 into @xmath28 .",
    "given that this mapping is performed independently for each point in @xmath26 , then from the `` thinning theorem ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.36 ) it follows that the processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are inhomogeneous sppps with density @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "given that we have two inhomogeneous sppp processes , it is not trivial to obtain the distribution of the distance from the user to the serving base station , which will be necessary later on to compute the sinr cdf .",
    "in fact , assuming the user be in los with the serving base station at distance @xmath33 , there might be an interfering bs at distance @xmath34 which is in nlos with the user .",
    "this is possible because the nlos propagation is affected by a higher attenuation than the los propagation .",
    "hence , to make our problem more tractable , we map the set of points of the process @xmath28 , which corresponds to the nlos base stations , into an equivalent los process @xmath35 ; each point @xmath36 located at distance @xmath37 from the user is mapped into a point @xmath38 located at distance @xmath39 from the user , so that the bs located at @xmath38 provides the same signal power to the user with path - loss @xmath40 as if the base station were located at @xmath24 with path - loss @xmath41 .",

    "[ fig : sir_cdfs ] .    .",
    "]    as we can from this plot , the two cdfs well match for different values of bs densities ; this implies that our model is well suited to study the effect of the los / nlos propagation on the performance of dense networks , as it yields results in line with those obtained with the 3gpp model . on the contrary ,",
    "the sir obtained with   as @xmath11 only matches the 3gpp benchmark for high cell densities ; in fact , at high densities the strongest interferers are in los with the user regardless of the shape of the @xmath11 functions we have tested .",
    "using as probability los function would give us accurate results only for a limited range of bss density and , therefore , would not be suitable for the kind of study we carry out in our paper .",
    "to study the performance of the dense networks as a function of the bs density , we evaluated numerically the se ( eq . ) , the ase ( eq . ) and the outage probability ( obtained from eq . ) .",
    "we first present the se results , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_density ] .        from this plot",
    ", we can see that the se curve is not constant but exhibits a peak for a given value of base station density .",
    "this result is in contrast with what we would obtain if we used a single slope propagation model , for which the se has been shown to be constant and thus independent of the base station density  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the reason for observing a non constant behaviour of the se curve as a function of the bs density is the los / nlos propagation .",
    "the peak of the curve is observed for a given value of the bs density which we will refer to as _ optimal bs density for the se _ , denoted by @xmath103 . at the optimal bs density ,",
    "the user is likely to be in los with the serving bs , while it is in nlos with most of the interferers , meaning that the interference power is low . for bs densities lower than @xmath103 ,",
    "the serving bs is likely to be in nlos with the users with a consequent reduction of the received power , of the sinr and therefore of the se . on the contrary , at",
    "bs densities higher than @xmath103 , the interfering bss are likely to be in los with the user , causing an overall interference growth and thus a reduction of the sir and se .",
    "the behaviour of the se curve is also influenced by the los probability as a function of the distance .",
    "in fact , looking at the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_vs_density ] , we notice that the optimal se density depends on the los likelihood parameter l. in sparser propagation environments ( e.g. , @xmath104 m ) the propagation is likely to be of the los kind at longer distances from the user , compared to the case of dense propagation environments ; this means that @xmath103 will be reached at a lower bs density .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the ase curves for different los propagation environments .        unlike the se ,",
    "the ase is an increasing function of the bs density @xmath3 and this is due to the effect of the cell densification , as shown in  .",
    "nonetheless , the se has an impact on the ase , as we can notice from the lower steepness of the ase curve .",
    "in particular , the ase switches from a superlinear gain at low cell densities to a sublinear gain at high cell - densities . to complete the analysis of the performance of cell densification",
    ", we also need to evaluate the outage probability curves , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .        from this plot we can see that , at higher bs densities , the outage starts growing drastically and , depending on the los likelihood",
    ", it can reach 22 - 32% for -10db sir threshold and 50 - 60% for -5db sir threshold .",
    "this is due to the effect of the interfering bss which , at high cell densities , are likely to be in los with the user .",
    "this will be perceived by the user as a strong interference , which causes an sir reduction .",
    "in addition , let us notice that in environments with higher nlos probability , the optimum of the outage curve is achieved at higher bs densities .    in the light of our study , we make the argument that , despite the high gain provided in terms of cell ase , cell densification can severely affect the outage probability and hence the network coverage .",
    "therefore , if ones needs an extremely dense cell deployment to meet some given capacity requirements , networks will require interference handling techniques in order to operate in a satisfactory manner .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a stochastic geometry framework to study the coverage / outage probability , the spectral efficiency ( se ) and the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) of dense small cell networks where the signal path - loss model includes both los and nlos components . through our formulation , we have investigated how the network performance scales with the density of the base station deployment and we studied the effect of the propagation environment in terms of los likelihood on se , ase and outage probability .",
    "finally , we have shown that propagation environments with high nlos probability allow for a denser cell deployment .",
    "overall , in this paper we sought to uncover insights on how dense networks should be deployed while taking into account a model that more accurately describes the signal propagation compared to the more common single slope path - loss , which is the current standard reference model when studying wireless networks .",
