    "it was discovered that when the two orbital planes were significantly misaligned , between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , there was a high - amplitude modulation in the eccentricity of the inner orbit ( in their examples the satellite and the asteroid ) and the mutual inclination .",
    "contrastingly , the outer eccentricity was seen to remain constant .",
    "overall , this is known as a kozai - lidov ( k - l ) cycle or effect .",
    "the k - l effect was later generalised to the case of three bodies of comparable mass @xcite for the application to triple star systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoo_diagram]b ) .",
    "it has subsequently been implicated , for example , in the production of tight stellar binaries ( period @xmath2 d ) . in this scenario the k - l cycle induced on the inner binary leads to close encounters between the two stars , at which point tidal friction dissipates orbital energy and shrinks the inner orbit ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the theory has been extended to eccentric outer orbits , in which case higher - order effects cause the system to be chaotic , possibly inducing flips in the inner orbit orientation .",
    "this has been applied to multi - planet systems ( fig .",

    "[ fig : zoo_diagram]a - c is that the system s orbital angular momentum is largely confined to the outer orbit . the timescale , amplitude and limits of k - l cycles do vary between the different configurations , but for initially circular orbits there is qualitatively not a radical departure from the original work of @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",

    "there are also theoretical arguments for the existence of misaligned circumbinary planets , as a result of planet - planet scattering ( e.g. @xcite in the context of single stars ) , a misaligned disc ( e.g. 99 herculis , @xcite , kh 15d , @xcite ) or an interaction with an outer tertiary star @xcite .    in a circumbinary planetary system",

    "[ fig : zoo_diagram ] and it means that the classic studies of @xcite and @xcite are no - longer entirely applicable .",
