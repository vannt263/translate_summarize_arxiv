    "in fact , the analogue of theorem  [ theo : classif ] without this hypothesis , that is , the classification of topological types of real regular elliptic surfaces with a real section and contained in a given complex deformation family , can be deduced directly from theorem  [ theo : classif ] .",

    "the resulting list is shortened thanks to the following inequalities which arise essentially because the surface is elliptic .",
    "namely the first mod 2 betti number @xmath54 and the number of connected components are bounded by @xmath55    the upper bound on the first betti number is due to a more general result of v.  kharlamov ( see theorem  [ theo : rv ] ) .",

    "a morse simplification for either real elliptic surfaces corresponds then to collapsing one oval of the curve @xmath65 .",

    "one advantage of the construction used in section  [ sec : collapsing ] comes from the obvious observation that a morse simplification may not be obtained a priori in a continuous family of real regular jacobian elliptic surfaces .",
