    "in this talk we would like to give an overview of the experimental and theoretical status of exclusive baryonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the announcement of the first measurement of the decay modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath0 decays by argus @xcite has stimulated extensive theoretical studies during the period of 1988 - 1992 .",
    "however , experimental and theoretical activities towards baryonic @xmath0 decays suddenly faded away after 1992 .",
    "this situation was dramatically changed in the past six years .",
    "interest in this area was revitalized by many new measurements at cleo , belle and babar followed by active theoretical studies .",
    "besides the threshold enhancement effect observed in the differential branching fraction of @xmath8 , belle has also measured the angular distribution of the antiproton in the @xmath9 system and found that the @xmath10 tends to emerge opposite the direction of the photon .",
    "the angular asymmetry is measured by belle to be @xmath11 for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the meson pole diagram is responsible for low - mass enhancement and does not show a preference for the correlation between the baryon pair and the photon .",
    "our prediction @xmath12 ( see table [ tab : radbr ] ) is consistent with experiment ."
