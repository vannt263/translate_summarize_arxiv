    "one of the assumptions underpinning the conventional navier - stokes - fourier set of equations is that of local thermodynamic equilibrium . this assumption allows the representation of thermodynamic variables ( e.g.  temperature , density , pressure ) as locally constant at a given time and position , and the use of equations of state .",
    "the assumption that microscopic relaxation processes are not of concern is , however , inadequate in flows where the microscopic relaxation time is comparable to the characteristic time of evolution of the macroscopic field variables . in the kinetic theory of dilute gases ,",
    "such flows are identified with high knudsen numbers ( conventionally defined as a ratio of the average time between molecule / molecule collisions to a macroscopic characteristic time of the flow , however see @xcite ) .",
    "experimental observations of sound wave propagation at high knudsen number challenge many continuum hydrodynamics and kinetic theory models @xcite ; it is well - known that the navier - stokes - fourier model fails to predict sound wave propagation at high knudsen number .",
    "another problem arises in the so - called `` heat conduction paradox '' , according to which an unphysical infinite speed of thermal wave propagation is predicted by the energy equation closed with fourier s law .",
    "generally , techniques for investigating gas flows in which the navier - stokes - fourier model is inadequate are based on approximate solutions to the boltzmann dilute gas kinetic equation , for which a wide number of mathematical methods are found in the literature @xcite .",
    "regarding the specific problem of predicting sound wave propagation in monatomic gases in the high knudsen number regime , many of these boltzmann based approximations fail , as does navier - stokes - fourier @xcite .",
    "while a few have shown some agreement with experiments @xcite , detailed analysis makes any conclusion far from clear - cut @xcite .",
    "for example , if the experimental set - up is configured to measure propagations of plane harmonic waves @xcite , boltzmann kinetic models predict unconventional pressure fields , even though the phase speeds and damping coefficients do agree with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "recently developed continuum models also show discrepancies in these predictions , particularly in the damping @xcite .",
    "the unphysical predictions of the conventional navier - stokes - fourier model have been investigated in terms of the `` heat conduction paradox '' .",
    "early investigations criticized the expression of fourier s law , suggesting instead that the heat flux expression should be transformed from the parabolic form of the heat conduction equation to a simple hyperbolic equation with a finite speed of propagation . while the original demonstration by cattaneo @xcite has a flaw @xcite , a cattaneo - vermot heat flux has been formalized more elegantly using fading memory theory ( which essentially aims to remove the local equilibrium assumption ) .",
    "variants and generalizations have been proposed , and compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics has been assessed @xcite",
    ". however , these investigations concentrate on modifications to the simple heat conduction equation ; they are not , to our knowledge , developed within the framework of complete fluid dynamic equations and a full dispersion analysis .    in this paper",
    "we investigate hydrodynamic models in which the assumptions limiting the application of the conventional navier - stokes - fourier model are clearly released ; this is therefore outside the framework of pure approximation solutions to the boltzmann kinetic equation . in previous work , we proposed releasing the local equilibrium assumption by including the spatial distributions of molecules within the kinetic description @xcite .",
    "while our description was motivated by an unusual volume diffusion claimed by brenner @xcite , it has been recently pointed out that the original brenner modification does not predict sound wave speeds correctly @xcite .",
    "here we show that our volume - based hydrodynamic model can reproduce the experimental sound wave propagation data from ref .",
    "@xcite with excellent agreement .",
    "moreover , our model offers a more reliable explanation of the experiments , which were designed to range up to the free molecular regime in which there are no collisions between molecules and therefore the definition of sound as a pressure wave becomes problematic .",
    "this paper starts with a summary of our volume model that incorporates effects from microscopic spatial distributions of the gaseous molecules .",
    "subsequently , a linear stability analysis of the model equations is performed , and the predicted dispersion and damping compared with experiments .",
    "the traditional single particle distribution function used in the boltzmann kinetic equation for a monatomic gas attributes no particular importance to the spatial arrangements of molecules .",
    "an average number of molecules is associated with a position @xmath0 and a velocity @xmath1 . in order to account for microscopic spatial fluctuations , due to non - uniformity in molecular spatial configurations ,",
    "we have considered within the set of microscopic variables the microscopic free volume , @xmath2 , around each gaseous molecule .",
    "a single particle distribution function @xmath3 is then defined to describe the probability that a molecule at a given time @xmath4 is located in the vicinity of position @xmath0 , has its velocity in the vicinity of @xmath1 , and has around it a microscopic free space given by the additional variable @xmath2 .    a boltzmann - like kinetic equation for @xmath5",
    "is then derived as @xcite : @xmath6 in which the term on the right - hand - side is the hard sphere molecule collision integral ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to post - collision molecules , @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to pre - collision molecules , @xmath11 is the molecule relative velocity , @xmath12 the collision differential cross section , @xmath13 an element of solid angle . on the left - hand - side appears a new term involving @xmath14 , which arises primarily from the introduction of the new variable @xmath2 into the distribution function . in the derivation of equation ( [ eq.boltzmann.kok ] ) , molecular exchanges of momentum through interactions have been assumed to be independent of their spatial configurations .",
    "three contributions to the time variations of @xmath15 are seen within equation ( [ eq.boltzmann.kok ] ) .",
    "molecular free - stream motions are given by the second term on the left - hand - side .",
    "the third term on the left - hand - side arises from effects of molecular interactions on their spatial distributions . finally , the collision integral is the traditional momentum exchange between molecules that provides changes in molecular velocities .",
    "these latter two terms infer that the real molecular potential interactions are represented in this kinetic model by two separate actions : intermolecular force effects on spatial distributions , and collisional effects on molecular velocities .      as @xmath16",
    "is defined as a probability density function , we have a normalization factor , @xmath17 the mean value , @xmath18 , of a gas property @xmath19 is then defined by , @xmath20 the local average of @xmath2 is therefore the local mean free volume @xmath21 around each gaseous molecule , i.e. @xmath22 from this mean value of the volume around a molecule , we define the mass - density in the vicinity of position @xmath0 through : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the molecular mass .",
    "two mean velocities are defined using two different weighting values : the local mean mass - velocity , @xmath25 , is given through @xmath26 and a local mean volume - velocity , @xmath27 , by using the microscopic free volume as the weighting , @xmath28 the two definitions @xmath29 and @xmath30 coincide if @xmath2 is a constant , i.e. in a homogeneous medium where density is constant throughout .",
    "it can be shown that the difference between these two velocities , @xmath31 , behaves like a mass - density diffusion @xcite .",

    "the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are , respectively , dynamic viscosity , heat conductivity , bulk viscosity , and the mass - density diffusion coefficient .",
    "as the kinetic pressure @xmath44 is defined by the trace of the pressure tensor we also have @xmath50 .",
    "previous volume diffusion hydrodynamic models have been based on separating the mean velocity in the conventional mass conservation equation ( continuity equation ) , from the mean velocity in the navier - stokes momentum equation via newton s viscosity law @xcite .",
    "this has proven controversial @xcite  problems in differentiating the mass - flux from the momentum density , and in conserving angular momentum when the velocity on the left - hand - side of the navier - stokes equation is substituted for , have been raised . in our approach , however , a mass flux is given by @xmath51 from the mass - density equation ( [ densitynewhydro ] ) , and involves the same velocity , @xmath52 , as in newton s viscosity law ( equation [ fluxes - new ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , the velocity on the left - hand - side of the new momentum equation ( [ momentumnewhydro ] ) remains the conventional mass velocity @xmath30 ( following newton s second law ) .",
    "consequently the two flaws mentioned in connection with volume - based hydrodynamics in reference @xcite are not present in our set of equations ( [ massnewhydro])([fluxes - new - end ] ) .",
    "a consequence of our localized microscopic volume description is the appearance of @xmath14 , the time rate of change of microscopic volume .",
    "although this term could be proposed using details of the interactions between particles , here we instead test a phenomenological expansion of @xmath53 as a function of the fluid macroscopic thermodynamic variables .",
    "first we relate variations of the microscopic @xmath2 to variation of its macroscopic average @xmath54 , through a relaxation approximation : @xmath55 the derivative @xmath56 refers to the time rate of change of microscopic properties while @xmath57 refers to the time rate of change of macroscopic properties , with @xmath58 a relaxation time . expanding @xmath59 as a function of thermodynamic variables we have : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the gas expansion and compressibility coefficients given by , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in our description local thermodynamic equilibrium is not required",
    ". relations @xmath41 and @xmath43 define the temperature and pressure ( following their classical definitions in kinetic theory ) , therefore there is a reciprocal relation between temperature and pressure , @xmath67 , by construction without further assumption . if the perfect gas ( equilibrium ) equation of state is enforced , and we confuse @xmath68 with @xmath69 in equation ( [ expres_w ] ) , then the gas expansion and compressibility coefficients in equations ( [ expres - alpha - chi ] ) are the ideal gas coefficients , i.e. @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the second order contributions vanish from equation ( [ expres_w ] ) . but as we are not restricting ourselves to local thermodynamic equilibrium , a departure from these ideal coefficients may be expected .",
    "now we turn to investigate sound dispersion using both the first and the second order approximations to @xmath14 given in equation ( [ expres_w ] ) .",
    "we consider our hydrodynamic model in a one - dimensional flow configuration .",
    "an equilibrium ground state is defined by the flow variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , u@xmath76 , with @xmath77 the specific gas constant .",
    "then a perturbation from this ground state is introduced as follows : @xmath78 where the asterisked variables represent dimensionless quantities .",
    "the perturbation of the volume velocity is specified through the relationship @xmath79 .",
    "linearizing @xmath67 gives @xmath80 .",
    "the dimensionless space and time variables are given by , @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "the dimensionless linearized equations , including the general expression for @xmath14 in equation ( [ expres_w ] ) , can therefore be written :    continuity : :    @xmath83 mass - density : :    @xmath84 momentum : :    @xmath85 energy : :    @xmath86    where the different dimensionless transport coefficients are given through : @xmath87 and @xmath88 note that the dimensionless transport coefficients in equations ( [ transpo - coeff - dimens ] ) follow from the dimensionless form of the hydrodynamic set of equations .",

    "navier - stokes - fourier has only two modes : one mode fits the phase speed and damping measurements at low knudsen number , but has an infinite speed of propagation for high knudsen number .",
    "the second mode shows an infinite inverse phase speed at low knudsen number , and is interpreted as the heat mode @xcite .",
    "+    departures from these predictions are expected for our volume - based hydrodynamic model when @xmath118 .",
    "we find that the model is stable , in the case of a first order approximation to @xmath14 , if @xmath119 and @xmath120 are both simultaneously smaller than one , or @xmath121 and @xmath122 , approximately ; this is illustrated in figure [ stab - navier - corrected ] .",
    "comparison of the dispersion with experiments shows globally the same results as in the navier - stokes - fourier case .",
    "but , as seen in figure [ navier - corrected ] where we have @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the agreement with the low frequency regime is improved , particularly in the damping coefficient . both the phase speed and the damping are adequately predicted up to @xmath126 , whereas the damping was predicted only up to @xmath127 by navier - stokes - fourier alone ( figure [ damp - navier ] ) .",
    "figure [ navier - corrected ] also shows that there are now three modes , two of which display transient diffusion behaviour ( i.e.high damping in low frequency regimes ) .",
    "while one of these should be considered as the heat mode , as previously , the other should be attributed to transient mass - density diffusion , as introduced by our new volume - based description ( in addition to the heat diffusion ) .",
    "this new mode is the most affected by the mass - density diffusivity , i.e. , by @xmath91 .",
    "the high frequency regime is still incorrectly predicted by the sound mode , as in the case of navier - stokes - fourier .",
    "later we will see that the infinite speed of propagation and zero damping in the high frequency regime can all be removed with the inclusion of the new mass - density mode .",
    "+     +      now we set , @xmath128 , that is , @xmath14 is given by an expression with only the second order terms of equation ( [ expres_w ] ) . in this case , we observe that the set of volume - based equations has a wider range of stability , provided @xmath129 approximately ( see figure [ stab - kokou - second ] ) .",
    "figure [ kokou - second ] shows that the phase speed prediction of one of the modes now agrees perfectly with experiment , in both the low and the high frequency regimes .",
    "this mode actually corresponds to the pressure mode , and it merges into the new mass - density mode in the high frequency regime . for comparison , in figure [ comparedother ] this physical mode is plotted with the experimental data and results from two recent continuum models derived as approximation solutions to the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "we observe that our volume model is competitive with the best of these two models .",
    "our new model has the best damping coefficient predictions in the low knudsen number regime , and we note an unphysical negative damping coefficient predicted by the second order model of spiegel and thiffeault @xcite .",
    "+     +     +    in our investigations , our choice of the values of different coefficients in the volume model has been primarily motivated by finding the best agreement with the experimental data",
    ". however , coefficient @xmath91 , set to @xmath130 for figure [ navier - corrected ] , agrees with an interpretation of @xmath91 as a schmidt number with a value of @xmath131 for monatomic hard sphere molecular gases ; a value of @xmath132 has been used for the dispersion analysis in reference @xcite .",
    "while the stability depends on the expression of @xmath14 , our volume - based set of equations seems to remain stable for whatever value the schmidt number is set to , i.e. , whatever the mass - density diffusivity .",
    "the dimensionless expansion and compressibility coefficients we obtained depart from their ( equilibrium state ) ideal gas values of @xmath110 .",
    "these departures from ideality may be attributable to real gas effects now incorporated in our volume - based description .",
    "similar results to those presented in our figures are also obtained with other combinations of the various coefficients .",
    "for example , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 give the same results as in figure [ navier - corrected ] .",
    "this recalls experimental reports that different gases can produce similar results @xcite .",
    "in any case , the various coefficients in our volume model leave room to incorporate the various properties of the gas under investigation .      in figures [ damp - navier ] , [ damp - navier - corrected ] and [ damp - kokou ] , the predicted damping coefficient tends to zero as the knudsen number becomes large .",
    "this is a very common result when using continuum models , as seen on figure [ comparedother ] .",
    "problems have also been pointed out in comparisons with experiments in this regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , researchers have argued on the basis of spectral analysis that continuum models based on a finite set of partial differential equations can not capture this branch of the graph @xcite . in any case , interpreting sound waves in terms of pressure waves and momentum exchanges between ( only ) molecules during collisions should be expected to lead to vanishing damping as intermolecular collisions are no longer the dominant phenomena in the very high knudsen number regime @xcite .",
    "we now consider earlier comments by some investigators @xcite who , analyzing the experimental set - up , suggested that a model to predict this sound dispersion must have a knudsen number expression and a dimensional analysis that reflects the distinction between the molecule / molecule collision - dominated regime and the molecule / surface collision - dominated regime .    in the experimental set - up",
    "the gas was placed between source and receiver then disturbed by a plane harmonic sound wave with a fixed frequency at the source @xcite .",
    "the primary variable parameter in the experiments was the distance between the source and the receiver .",
    "at very low pressures , the molecule / molecule collisions that predominate in a high pressure ( or continuum ) regime , become negligible , and molecular collisions with surfaces dominate . in this situation ,",
    "the microscopic collision length scale becomes the distance traveled by molecules to reach the surfaces  no longer the mean free path that is the length scale in the continuum regime .",
    "accordingly , schotter @xcite , who also reported similar data to greenspan , meyer and sessler , presents a different dimensional analysis , introducing two different microscopic times leading to two different knudsen number expressions .",
    "the first of these corresponds to a pressure - based intermolecular collision time , and is the same definition as in references @xcite .",
    "the second microscopic time is independent of molecule / molecule momentum transfers and instead characterizes the frequency of collisions with the surfaces .",
    "as we show explicitly in the appendix , greenspan s dimensionless quantities in equation ( [ damp - speed - expre ] ) , and the accompanying interpretation of frequency as a ( conventional ) knudsen number , are founded on molecule / molecule collisions and so become inappropriate at high knudsen number where these types of collisions are no longer the principal momentum transfer mechanism ( see also reference @xcite ) . a dimensional analysis using the separation distance between the surfaces leads to a different expression for the dimensional damping coefficient in a low pressure gas , which is also , conversely , invalid for high pressure cases ( i.e.  at low conventional knudsen number ) .",
    "this second expression may also be derived using the following observation .    in section [ sec - linearequation ]",
    "we performed a dimensional analysis , and introduced equation ( [ harmonic - wrong ] ) which assumes the harmonic wave form .",
    "as the set of partial differential equations is linearized and dimensionless , characteristic time and length scales have therefore been introduced before equation ( [ harmonic - wrong ] ) . a better way of expressing the harmonic wave is in a completely dimensionless form , i.e. , @xmath136 , \\label{harmonic - correct}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are , respectively , the dimensionless complex wave frequency and dimensionless wave number .",
    "moreover , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , with @xmath141 and @xmath142 the characteristic time and length previously introduced in equation ( [ micro - timedefo ] ) .",
    "the constant coefficient @xmath143 , from the adiabatic exponent of a monatomic gas , could be simply incorporated in the definition of the reference speed and is not here the main issue . the dimensionless phase speed and dimensionless spatial damping coefficient",

    "\\lambda_h = -   \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}im[k^ * ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we observe that while the dimensionless phase speed remains the same as previously , the dimensionless damping coefficient is different ( see equation [ damp - speed - expre ] ) : it does not contain the frequency",
    ".     described by a second order approximation , and using the definitions in equation ( [ damp - speed - expre - correct ] ) ; @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "note the agreement with one of the modes at high knudsen numbers.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in figure [ paradoxical_damp ] we plot the dimensionless damping coefficient by our new hydrodynamic model , but using the redefined expressions in equation ( [ damp - speed - expre - correct ] ) ( and using same coefficients @xmath91 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 as in figure [ kokou - second ] ) .",
    "it is seen that our model reproduces the high frequency branch , with the correct asymptotic value of the damping .",
    "in addition , this is represented by the new mass - density mode , not the classical pressure mode which instead diverges .",
    "broadly , this curve catches the shape and the shallow maximum around @xmath150 .",
    "the agreement is not so good by @xmath126 , and becomes somewhat inaccurate for low knudsen numbers , as expected .    in summary , expressions ( [ damp - speed - expre ] ) and ( [ damp - speed - expre - correct ] ) are each compatible with different knudsen number regimes and are both required for a proper interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "our volume - based hydrodynamic model has been shown , therefore , to predict both the low and the high frequency branch of the damping coefficient well , while the inverse phase speed is always well - predicted .    in his experiments ,",
    "schotter @xcite reported plane standing waves for all knudsen numbers . because of difficulties surrounding the predictions of the high knudsen number branch , other researchers assumed , however , that a plane wave analysis could not capture this regime @xcite . in our analysis ,",
    "mass - density and pressure fields are plane harmonic and therefore agree also with schotter s experimental observation .",
    "we also confirm the unusual ( i.e.  non - pressure - wave ) characteristics of sound waves in this regime because our good predictions here are provided by our model s mass - density diffusion terms .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ dampingkokouall ] , where the two different modes fitting the experimental damping data in the low and the high frequency regimes are both plotted .",
    "finally , even with the modified definitions of equation ( [ damp - speed - expre - correct ] ) , the navier - stokes - fourier model gives at @xmath151 a value of the damping which is @xmath152 times the experimental value of approximately @xmath153 .",
    "so the conventional model still provides incorrect predictions .",
    "predicting sound wave phase speed and damping is a challenge both for kinetic models derived from the boltzmann dilute gas equation and for continuum fluid hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the few kinetic models @xcite that agree with the experimental data over the entire range of knudsen number suffer three major criticisms .",
    "first , questions often arise about the compatibility of kinetic boundary value problems with experimental measurement @xcite .",
    "second , the kinetic models predict non - standard pressure fields @xcite ; in contrast , experiments have been based on harmonic pressure waves , and indicate a plane standing wave existing in the gas medium at all knudsen numbers during measurement .",
    "third , the different mechanisms of momentum transfer in the high pressure and the low pressure cases are not always compatible with the kinetic model predictions @xcite .",
    "a final issue , often raised with continuum fluid models beyond navier - stokes - fourier , is the appearance of a large number of modes so it is not always easy to identify the mode that should describe the sound wave .",
    "our figures [ kokou - second ] and [ paradoxical_damp ] show that the continuum - based model considered in this paper reproduces the experiments over the range of knudsen number without the difficulties listed above . in these figures",
    "there are only three distinct modes to be associated with pressure , temperature and mass - density in a given regime . in our understanding ,",
    "pressure and mass - density disturbances are distinct plane harmonic waves that dominate in different knudsen number regimes ( see figure [ dampingkokouall ] ) .",
    "the existence of a mass - density wave explains the plane standing wave observed in experiments in the high knudsen number regime ; this mode is non - existent in conventional fluid dynamic equations as there is no explicit mass - density diffusion ( or mass - density wave propagation ) .",
    "the agreement between our theoretical damping results and experiment can be fully explained in terms of two mean - free - paths inherent in the experimental set - up ; one mean free path is founded on the standard kinetic pressure and molecular collisions , and the other founded on the separation distances of the solid surfaces .",
    "the latter also underlines the fundamental basis of our new approach itself : the variation of the surface position is easily associated with variation of the volume between molecules .",
    "our prediction of the high knudsen number regime is possible only if we adopt the second - order expression for @xmath14 given in equation ( [ expres_w ] ) .",
    "this shows that this regime is best described by microscopic structure evolutions , and not macroscopic average thermodynamic property evolutions ; therefore there is no localized thermodynamic equilibrium in this case .",

    "conversely , a fixed value of the dimensionless frequency is a simple scaling factor for the knudsen number .",
    "consequently , and for this particular configuration , one may absorb the factor @xmath169 into @xmath137 and interpret the variation of their product as either knudsen number or dimensionless frequency variations",
    ".    however , this description relies on the definition of the microscopic time @xmath141 as the time between molecule / molecule collisions . if this microscopic time is physically undefined , or becomes large , then equation ( [ app - harmonic4 ] ) and the interpretation that follows it becomes invalid because the product @xmath168 is indeterminate",
    "this is the case when the gas is confined between two surfaces so that collisions between molecules are no longer the most important mechanism of momentum transfer from one surface to the other , and instead the interactions of the molecules directly with the two surfaces ( the source and receiver in the experiments ) is .    in greenspan",
    "s work , which has been followed by several authors , the non - dimensionalisation starts with a reference speed , denoted @xmath170 , which in our notation corresponds to @xmath171 , assuming an approximation of the dispersion at high pressure .",
    "then the intermolecular collision mean time @xmath141 is determined assuming maxwell molecules . the dimensionless sound speed and damping",
    "are given as they appear through equation ( [ app - harmonic4 ] ) while the inverse of the product @xmath168 is referred to as `` reynold s number '' .",
    "in any case , one can see easily from the expression @xmath172 that for all theories predicting a finite value of the damping this dimensionless expression should give zero damping for @xmath99 tending to infinity .",
    "so , the expression , at first glance , is not even a well - indicated form to compare between different theoretical results in this field .",
    "a different analysis is therefore required .",

    "as there are , on average , no intermolecular collisions in that period we expect the wave propagation to become independent of the conventional knudsen number beyond a certain limit .",

    "it is also worth noting that the failure of greenspan s analysis at high frequencies means that a high conventional knudsen number does not necessarily mean a high frequency , and _",
    "vice versa_. in figure [ paradoxical_damp ] , @xmath99 is strictly speaking referring to a separation - distance - based knudsen number , not the real dimensional frequency  as we have shown through equation ( [ app - harmonic12 ] ) .",
    "we have not compared our theoretical results with the more recent experimental data by schotter @xcite .",
    "this is because , while schotter differentiated between two microscopic time scales , he defined the dimensionless parameters as in greenspan s analysis , i.e. , a dimensionless damping coefficient that depends on the frequency over the full regime .",
