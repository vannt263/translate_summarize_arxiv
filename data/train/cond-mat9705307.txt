    "the low temperature behavior of the strongly interacting quantum liquid @xmath0he has been a subject of experimental and theoretical research for decades . in 1908",
    "helium was first liquified by kamerlingh onnes and in 1911 he discovered a sharp maximum in the density at what is now commonly called the @xmath1-point.@xcite after that , a number of macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluid flow , second sound , the fountain effect and quantized vortices were observed .",
    "phenomenological theories were developed and justified from a microscopic point of view.@xcite also , the famous kosterlitz - thouless transition was first observed in thin superfluid helium films.@xcite    in the solid phase of @xmath0he , which is reached only at low temperature and high pressure ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , one also expects to observe macroscopic quantum phenomena because of the large zero point vibration of the atoms about their equilibrium position.@xcite because of this , solid helium has been termed a quantum solid .    in",
    "such a solid , the interstitials and vacancies are effectively delocalized due to their ability to tunnel through the potential barriers . at low temperatures these point defects",
    "then form a weakly interacting bose gas . furthermore",
    ", the large zero point motion results in an unusually rapid exchange rate of nearest neighbour atoms , which may lead to large ring exchanges between the helium atoms.@xcite bose - einsein condensation of the defects or exchange processes of the lattice atoms may then open two routes to a new phase of matter at low temperature in which long - range crystalline and superfluid order coexist .",
    "this is called the supersolid phase .",
    "@xcite    theoretically the existence of such a phase has since long been anticipated.@xcite however , it was only recently claimed to have been observed experimentally that three dimensional solid @xmath0he is a spatially ordered superfluid , or supersolid , at sufficiently low temperatures and densities .",
    "the experiments leading to this claim were performed by lengua and goodkind , who measured the attenuation and velocity of sound in solid @xmath0he for relatively high purities and low atomic densities of the quantum crystal.@xcite the temperature dependence of the attenuation revealed a coupling to thermally activated excitations , consistent with the existence of a propagating mode in the gas of point defects that is expected to be present in a quantum crystal.@xcite furthermore , assuming the speed of sound of the defect mode to depend on the density of defects in the same way as in a dilute bose gas , they found a relation between the temperature dependence of the phase velocity and that of the defect density . to consistently interpret their data they then had to assume a macroscopic population of the zero momentum state of the point defects , i.e. a bose - einstein condensation of the point defects .",
    "thus the phase diagram of @xmath0he in three dimensions would be qualitatively given by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . following a certain trajectory in this phase diagram",
    ", @xmath0he may undergo a transition from the normal phase to the superfluid phase at some temperature @xmath2 and subsequently from the superfluid to the supersolid phase at a temperature @xmath3 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the possibility of superfluid flow in a solid has since long been anticipated theoretically .",
    "andreev and lifschitz were the first to attempt to derive the hydrodynamics of a supersolid by including the effect of bose - einstein condensation of the defects on the hydrodynamics of an ideal crystal.@xcite in addition to this pioneering work , liu has more recently presented a thorough discussion of the andreev and lifschitz hydrodynamics.@xcite    however , it was pointed out by martin _ et.al .",
    "_ that the conventional treatment of the hydrodynamic equations for a classical crystal , which does nt include defects , is neccesarily incomplete since it yields the wrong number of modes.@xcite they identified the missing mode as a mode in the defect density .",
    "this implies that the hydrodynamics of andreev and lifshits is also incomplete , because it does not include the non - condensed defects and as a result does not lead to the required defect mode in the normal state of the crystal .",
    "in addition , martin _ et.al .",
    "_ assume diffusive dynamics for their defect mode .",
    "this seems to be appropriate for a classical but not for a quantum crystal , where the defect mode is expected to be a propagating mode , as is confirmed by the experiments of lengua and goodkind .    recently stoof _ et.al._ , in respons to experiments with submonolayer superfluid helium film,@xcite derived the hydrodynamic equations for an isotropic supersolid in two dimensions which did include propagating behavior of the crucial defect mode.@xcite moreover , the longitudinal part of the solid hydrodynamics derived by these authors turns out to be identical to the system of two coupled wave equations that lengua and goodkind used to accurately model their data",
    ". however , to apply these promising results to the experiments with solid helium , we have to extend them in two ways .",
    "first of all we have to consider a three dimensional system , and second of all we have to take into account the anisotropy of solid @xmath0he , which is a hexogonally closed packed ( hcp ) crystal .",
    "thus we hope to justify from a microscopic point of view the phenomenological equations that succesfully explained the propagation of sound in solid @xmath0he and led to the first claim of a supersolid phase in this system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] the hydrodynamic equations describing a normal solid with point defects will be derived .",
    "this is achieved by deriving an action describing a solid with dislocations , using methods developed by kleinert.@xcite from this action we obtain the interaction between phonons and a point defect , by seeing the point defect as a limiting case of a dislocation . also , a more microscopic point of view is presented and dissipation is included . in sec . [ section3 ]",
    "we then add a superfluid degree of freedom to our hydrodynamic equations in the usual way and in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] we discuss the experiment by lengua and goodkind in the light of our results .",
    "it should be noted that in order to understand this experiment it is not neccessary to include temperature flucuations into our considerations and we will neglect them in the rest of this article .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and outlook in sec .",
    "[ section5 ] .",
    "in this section we derive the hydrodynamics of a solid with point defects .",
    "this will be done by first considering the action describing phonons and their interaction with dislocation loops .",
    "we then obtain the interaction of phonons with vacancies and interstitials by shrinking a dislocation loop to zero radius and using a dipole - like approximation .",
    "next , we add the dynamics of the point defects .",
    "the structure of the resulting theory is much like that of an electron interacting with electro - magnetic fields .",
    "an intuitive microscopic picture of point defects is also presented which leads to an alternative derivation of the action descibing a solid with point defects .",
    "finally , the hydrodynamic equations are derived .",
    "we start with deriving a gauge theory that describes the solid phase at long wavelenghts . to describe point defects we only have to include dislocations into our theory .",
    "therefore we can ignore higher gradient elasticity , which would be needed if we also wanted to describe disclinations .",
    "this section is closely related to previous work done by kleinert @xcite but differs from it in the following aspects .",
    "first , we do not include higher gradient elasticity .",
    "second , we consider the more general case of anisotropic solids and third , we explicitly remove the unphysical gauge degrees of freedom in the resulting theory of ` quantum defect dynamics ' .",
    "the euclidian action for a solid with dislocations of arbitrary crystaline symmetry is given by @xcite    @xmath4 & = &   \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau \\int d{\\bf x } \\left \\ { \\frac{\\rho}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\tau } u_{i } - \\beta_{i})^{2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } ( u_{ij } - \\frac{\\beta_{ij } + \\beta_{ji}}{2 } ) c_{ijkl } ( u_{kl } - \\frac{\\beta_{kl } + \\beta_{lk}}{2 } ) \\right \\ } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the strain tensor , @xmath6 is the elasticity tensor whose structure is determined by the specific symmetry of the crystal under consideration and @xmath7 is the average mass density .",
    "this is the most general quadratic action compatibel with the symmetries of the crystal and the requirement that the hamiltonian of the system transforms under a gallilean transformation @xmath8 as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the total momentum of the crystal and m it s total mass .",
    "the latter determines the form of the kinetic energy .",
    "the dislocations mentioned above are topological defects , which exist because the displacement field is multivalued . in much the same way",
    ", vortices in a superfluid are a consequence of the multivaluedness of the phase field.@xcite the multivaluedness of a displacement field describing a dislocation becomes apparent when writing down what can be seen as the definition of a dislocation , namely    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is a contour enclosing a dislocation line @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the so - called burgers vector measuring the strength of the dislocation .",
    "this equation can be written in a differential form as follows    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is called the dislocation density .",
    "it is analogous to ampre s law @xmath17 and states that the displacement field is non - integrable along the line @xmath13 because here the dislocation gives a delta function contribution . if the line @xmath13 is parametrized by @xmath18 , the delta function along @xmath13 is defined by    @xmath19    if we would use in our calculations these multivalued displacement fields , the action would be given by eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) with @xmath20 .",
    "however , to perform a path integral over the @xmath21 it is much more convenient to use a singlevalued displacement field which takes values on the real axis .",
    "the unphysical singular contributions to the derivatives of a singlevalued displacement field which describes dislocations in a solid are compensated by substracting the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the relation between these quantities and the dislocation line @xmath13 is conveniently visualized by the volterra construction , which we now briefly explain .",
    "given a solid without imperfections , a dislocation can be created by removing from this solid a volume @xmath24 and drawing the boundary of the volume together , thus forming a surface @xmath25 with boundary @xmath13 , and restoring the crystaline symmetry everywhere except at this boundary @xmath13 .    the singlevalued displacement field which describes a dislocation created by this construction is discontinuous across the surface @xmath26 with a jump in the displacement field that is equal to the burgers vector @xmath14 .",
    "this discontinuity gives a delta function contribution to the gradient of the displacement field which is called the plastic distortion and is given by    @xmath27    the integral measure is defined by @xmath28 if the surface @xmath25 is parametrized by @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , if the dislocation line @xmath13 is moving with a speed @xmath30 , the time derivative of the displacement field gives a delta function contribution of @xmath31 .",
    "if we are not on a dislocation line , the physical values of the spatial and time derivatives of the displacement field should be continuous and are therefore given by    @xmath32    the value of these physical quantities equals what one would get by using the multivalued version of the displacement field to calculate the spatial and time derivatives.@xcite we thus see that the action introduced at the beginning of this section is indeed just the classical action for a perfect crystal straightforwardly generalized to include dislocations .",
    "@xcite    to be able to actually calculate the interaction between the phonons and the defects we write the action in a canonical form .",
    "we do this by introducing two new fields by means of a hubbard - stratonovich transformation.@xcite physically these field are the stress tensor @xmath33 and momentum density @xmath34 which are canonical to @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "it amounts to adding to the lagrangian density in eq .",

    "we believe that this is justified by noting that , when counting the number of conserved quantities , we should also include the conservation of defects . hence the continuity equations for @xmath132 and @xmath138 are roughly speaking associated with respectively a conservation law and a broken symmetry . indeed , our equations reproduce the set of coupled wave equations which were used by lengua and goodkind to interpret their data , and lead them to the identification of the observed collective mode as a propagating defect mode .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the hydrodynamic equations of supersolid @xmath0he by allowing both fluctuations in the defects density and lattice vibrations to lead to superfluid motion.@xcite if we include these superfluid degrees of freedom into our hydrodynamic equations in the standard way , we end up with what one might call a four fluid hydrodynamics instead of the usual two fluid hydrodynamics . as a result we end up with two second sound modes instead of one .",
    "we expect on general grounds that including temperature fluctuations leads to one of these modes becoming propagating whereas the other will remain diffusive . given these results it",
    "should then be possible in principle to identify experimentally an additional resonance in the attenuation and velocity of sound due to the coupling of these modes to the phonons . in our opinion",
    "this would be a more convincing experimental proof for the existence of a supersolid phase than the analysis made by lengua and goodkind .",
    "this research was supported by the stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) which is financially supported by the nederlandse organisatie vorr wetenschappelijk onderzoek ( nwo ) .",
