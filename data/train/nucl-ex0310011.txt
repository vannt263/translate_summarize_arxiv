    "of all particles , the @xmath8-meson has received the most attention with regard to medium modifications .",
    "since the @xmath0 carries the quantum numbers of the conserved vector current , its properties are related to chiral symmetry , and can be investigated with a variety of models .",
    "most models predict a reduction of the renormalized vector meson mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "a review of the field , up to 1999 , is given in ref .",
    "one of the first models was `` brown and rho scaling '' @xcite , in which the in - medium @xmath0 mass is rescaled according to the relation @xmath9 this relation is based on chiral symmetry and scale invariance , and predicts that the mass of the @xmath0 should drop by @xmath10 from its free mass value at standard nuclear density .",
    "this is supported by lattice qcd calculations @xcite , which suggest that chiral symmetry will be fully restored at @xmath11 mev and/or @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to mass rescaling , the in - medium shape of the @xmath0 may be changed by resonant interactions .",
    "one well - known model of these interactions is that of rapp , chanfray , and wambach @xcite . here ,",
    "the strong coupling of the @xmath0 with @xmath14 states in the nuclear medium , and @xmath0-baryon scattering , lead to a series of `` rhosobar '' excitations .",
    "this results in an enhancement of the low invariant mass portion of the @xmath0 spectral function .",
    "this model has been applied to the high temperature and high density regime of high energy heavy ion collisions with great success .",
    "this picture has been refined and extended by other groups in recent years , such as the relativistic - model calculation by post , leupold and mosel @xcite .",
    "these and other models will be discussed in more detail later in the paper .    experimental evidence for in - medium @xmath0 mass modification has been widespread , but all interpretations suffer from significant model uncertainties .",
    "for example , cern dilepton production data from s+au and s+w collisions at 200 gev / u yield a significant enhancement at low @xmath15 @xcite , indicative of a density - dependent @xmath0 mass reduction which is consistent with chiral symmetry restoration as well as with @xmath0-medium rescattering .",
    "an iucf @xmath16si@xmath17si polarization transfer experiment found an effective isovector @xmath18 interaction strength consistent with @xmath19 mev / c@xmath1 @xcite , and a kek 12 gev @xmath20 collision experiment yielded @xmath21 spectra which indicate a significant enhancement for cu which is not present for @xmath3c , consistent with @xmath22 mev / c@xmath1 @xmath23 mass shift @xcite , but these both suffer ambiguities in interpretation due to the use of a proton probe .",
    "frascati @xmath24 total photo - absorption cross sections on c , al , cu , sn , pb at 0.5 - 2.6 gev are smaller than expected , indicative of increased shadowing .",
    "these results are best explained in terms of a reduced in - medium mass , @xmath25 mev / c@xmath1 , which increases the coherence length @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "however , due to the inclusive nature of the experiment , this can only be considered an indirect observation of in - medium @xmath0 properties .",
    "finally , the tagx collaboration has investigated the @xmath27 reaction in the sub - threshold region . in this case , diffractive @xmath0 production is suppressed , as the reaction must utilize fermi momentum to produce a @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 s are produced with low boost with respect to the nuclear medium , so that they decay within 1 fm of their production point ( i.e. still within even a small nucleus ) .",
    "these two properties of the sub - threshold region reaction enhance the nuclear - medium effect .",
    "the effects of @xmath28 final state interactions ( fsi ) are minimized by the choice of a small nucleus ( @xmath2he ) .",
    "an energy - dependent mass reduction @xmath29 mev / c@xmath1 was found for @xmath30 mev @xcite , with evidence for even lower @xmath0 mass at lower photon energy @xcite . of these , ref .",
    "@xcite used an analysis technique significantly different than refs .",
    "@xcite , and yielded nearly the same @xmath31 value .",
    "a limitation of these results is the model - dependent separation of the @xmath0 channel from other processes leading to the @xmath14 state .",
    "experimental data which can be interpreted in a less model - dependent fashion are highly desirable , and this is the goal of the study reported here .    a technique which may allow a cleaner separation of the @xmath32 contribution from competing processes has recently been reported by the tagx collaboration @xcite . there , the @xmath0 decay angular distribution is reconstructed for sub - threshold @xmath1h and @xmath3c@xmath33 reaction data , and it is found that when kinematic cuts which enhance the relative population of @xmath32 decay compared to competing processes , such as @xmath34 production , are applied to the data , a strong cos@xmath35 distribution results . the only mechanism compatible with the features of the data is the decay of longitudinally polarized @xmath6 , consistent with a strong helicity - flip mechanism of @xmath0 production .",
    "this result forms the motivation for this work .",
    "such helicity - flip amplitudes are interesting , because they may be related to the @xmath0 production mechanism and so assist in such investigations . here",
    ", the emphasis is placed on the use of the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath6 to isolate its contribution to the @xmath14 data , with the goal being to extract the @xmath6 in - medium line shape and compare it to various phenomenological models .",
    "a preliminary analysis using this technique was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and this work presents our final results and conclusions for @xmath1h , @xmath2he and @xmath3c .",
    "the deuteron comprises an important element in the investigation of medium modifications .",
    "its low fermi momentum and nuclear matter density reduce the probability of medium modifications and/or nucleonic effects .",
    "however , the low binding energy and the better defined final states for monte carlo ( mc ) simulations also make the deuteron an attractive test case for comparisons with data and with the free @xmath0 line shape .",
    "@xmath3c is a `` benchmark '' test of nuclear modifications , because of its combination of nuclear size and density .",
    "unlike the simpler targets , the number of nucleons present in @xmath3c raise potential complications due to fsi , including absorption .",
    "the effects of such fsi will be investigated in detail later in this paper .",
    "@xmath2he may be expected to represent the `` nuclear '' aspects of @xmath3c with the simplicity of @xmath1h , as far as fsi and pion absorption corrections are concerned .",
    "the low relative @xmath0-n and @xmath36he momenta of this experiment largely compensate for the short nuclear radius disadvantage , compared to more massive nuclei , by increasing the probability of @xmath0 decay within the nuclear volume @xcite .",

    "vii compares the helicity angle analysis result to the previous tagx collaboration results . finally , in sec .",
    "viii the discussion and conclusions are presented .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on data taken in three separate running periods @xcite .",
    "together , they comprise data with @xmath1h , @xmath2he and @xmath3c targets .",
    "the @xmath33 experiments were carried out using the tagged photon beam of the 1.3-gev electron synchrotron ( es ) at the institute of nuclear study at tokyo ( ins ) and the tagx magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the photon beam is produced utilizing the 1.3 gev tokyo electron synchrotron with a duty factor of @xmath3710% @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : egam_spec ] displays the tagged photon energy distributions used in this work . as the data for the different targets were obtained at different times , and under slightly different experimental conditions , the shapes of the resulting tagged photon energy spectra are significantly different for the @xmath2he and cd@xmath38 targets .",
    "the @xmath2he target data are from refs . @xcite and @xcite , which used es nominal energies of 800 and 1220 mev , respectively .",
    "the cd@xmath38 target data were taken with three es energies of 1040 , 1180 and 1200 mev , with overlapping tagged photon energy distributions .     tagged photon energy distributions used in this work .",
    "data were divided into three @xmath39 bins of 600 - 800 mev , 800 - 960 mev , and 960 - 1120 mev.,width=321 ]    the data were divided into three tagged photon energy bins of 600 - 800 mev , 800 - 960 mev , and 960 - 1120 mev .",
    "the choice of the limits of these bins was motivated by the photon energy thresholds for @xmath0 production via the quasi - free and non - quasi - free mechanisms in nuclei .",
    "on @xmath40h , the threshold for production of @xmath0 with mass one @xmath41 lower than the nominal 770 mev / c@xmath1 ( i.e. 705 mev / c@xmath1 ) , is 971 mev .",
    "the division between the mid- and high - energy photon bins is placed near here , and so the highest photon energy bin is expected to receive a significant contribution from quasi - free @xmath0 production on all three targets .",
    "on @xmath3c , the corresponding photo - production threshold is 723 mev , while for the @xmath0 centroid it is 797 mev .",
    "this motivates the division between the low- and mid - energy bins to be 800 mev . in this case",
    ", the middle photon energy bin may contain contributions from the low - mass components of the @xmath0 ( more than one @xmath41 below mean ) in a quasi - free production mechanism , as well as nominal @xmath0 production from the nucleus as a whole .",
    "the mid - energy bin also has the best photon luminosity and event statistics for all three nuclear targets .",
    "the lowest photon energy bin is deeply sub - threshold and so will be the most sensitive to low - mass components of the @xmath0 in a nuclear environment",
    ". however , at these low energies the @xmath14 production cross - section is small , and any interpretation of the data will be complicated by significant phase - space restrictions and non-@xmath0 contributions .",
    "the @xmath2he data were obtained with the use of a cryogenic liquid target of 5 cm diameter and 0.0786 @xmath42 density @xcite .",
    "this necessitated an empty - target background subtraction procedure , explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . the @xmath1h and @xmath3c data were obtained together , via the use of a solid deuterated polyethylene and research grade graphite target assembly .",
    "the graphite target ( 0.069 g / cm@xmath1 ) was positioned at the nominal center of the tagx magnetic field , with two deuterated polyethylene targets ( total thickness 0.618 @xmath44 ) flanking it upstream ( -16.8 mm ) and downstream ( + 15.8 mm ) relative to the photon beam .",
    "the @xmath1h data were obtained by subtraction of the graphite target data from the cd@xmath38 target data , via the procedure discussed in section [ sec : subtract ] .",
    "the tagx spectrometer has an acceptance of @xmath45 sr for charged particles .",
    "it consists of a dipole magnet ( @xmath375 kg ) , drift chambers for tracking , and plastic scintillation counters for time - of - flight ( tof ) and trigger information .",
    "[ fig : tagx ] displays the layout of the tagx system for the @xmath1h and @xmath3c measurements .",
    "a brief description of the detectors follows .",
    "an extended description of the tagx spectrometer is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .     top view of the tagx spectrometer elements in place during the @xmath1h and @xmath3c data taking.,width=321 ]    directly surrounding the target is the inner hodoscope ( ih ) , made of two sets of six scintillator counters , one on each side of the beam .",
    "the ih is used in the trigger , as well as in measuring the time of flight ( tof ) of the outgoing particles @xcite .",
    "next are the two straw tube drift chambers ( sdc ) , located on opposite sides of the beam .",
    "their operation greatly improves the vertex resolution capability of the system , which aids in the suppression of experimental background .",
    "the sdc were designed to preserve the tagx @xmath45-sr acceptance prior to its installation , to not impose extensive modifications of the spectrometer , and to not induce significant energy losses to traversing particles by keeping its thickness to minimum .",
    "the sdc is explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    surrounding the sdc are two semi - circular cylindrical drift chambers ( cdc ) , subtending angles from 15@xmath46 to 165@xmath46 on both sides of the beam in the horizontal plane , and @xmath4718.3@xmath46 in the vertical plane .",
    "together with the sdc , they are used to determine the planar momentum and in - plane emission angle of the traversing charged particles , and the vertex position of the trajectory crossings .",
    "the outer hodoscope ( oh ) is a set of 33 scintillator elements placed after the cdc .",
    "each scintillator is oriented vertically , with pmt s attached at top and bottom to determine the track angle relative to the median plane .",
    "the two sets of hodoscopes , ih and oh , measure the tof of the tracked particles .    finally , for the @xmath1h and @xmath3c data taking a pressurized co@xmath38 cerenkov detector was added to further improve the suppression of beam - related electromagnetic ( em ) background .",
    "the gas pressure was slightly higher than atmosphere , resulting in an electron threshold of 17 mev / c .",
    "an aerogel cerenkov counter with @xmath48 was located at backward angle on beam right .",
    "the pion threshold for this detector was 570 mev / c .",
    "because of their proximity to the tagx magnetic field , neither detector was used in the on - line trigger decision .",
    "the remaining components of the tagx spectrometer are four 155  mm  @xmath49  50  mm  @xmath49  5  mm scintillator counters , with a primary function to veto @xmath21 background .",
    "these veto counters are positioned along the oh arms in the median plane , and eliminate charged - particle tracks registering within @xmath50 2.5 mm , mostly affecting forward - focused @xmath21 pairs produced copiously downstream of the target , but having a small effect on @xmath14 events .",
    "as our interest lay with @xmath14 production from the decay of the @xmath0 meson , the experiment trigger was set up to record two - charged particle coincidences on opposite sides of the beam axis .",
    "the reconstruction of the tagx data is briefly reviewed here ; a detailed account is in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the analysis ,",
    "a lab system of co - ordinates was used , in which the @xmath51-axis is taken to be along the direction of the photon beam and the @xmath52-axis is taken along the tagx magnetic field .",
    "the trajectory of a charged particle reconstructed by the sdc+cdc drift chamber system defined the horizontal component of the momentum , @xmath53 , the horizontal tracked trajectory length , @xmath54 , and the tangential direction of the track in the horizontal plane , @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting planar momentum resolution is given by the relation @xmath56 } p_{xy } + 0.12\\times 10^{-3}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the timing difference of the pmt s mounted on both ends of each oh scintillator gave the the @xmath52-component of the hit position , which measured the trajectory length along the @xmath52-axis ( @xmath57 ) , and allowed the magnitude of the momentum in three dimensions to be calculated .",
    "the out - of - plane trajectory length resolution was approximately @xmath58 cm .",
    "the resulting three dimensional momentum resolution is dominated by @xmath59 , above .",
    "the information from each of the two tracks is combined to provide the vertex position of each event in the @xmath60 plane .",

    "events were only kept if a @xmath63 and a @xmath64 were detected on opposite sides of the beam - line , a requirement consistent with the experiment trigger .",
    "because of the larger probability of one or more protons from the @xmath3c target also intercepting the spectrometer , events in which a proton was detected in addition to the left - right - going @xmath14 pair were also accepted for the cd@xmath38 experiment , only .",
    "@xmath66 events meeting this condition comprised 6% of the cd@xmath38 target event sample . `` three track '' events with a @xmath14 pair detected on the same side of the beam - line were excluded from further analysis in all cases .",

    "this necessitated the use of dedicated empty - target cell data acquisition runs , for the purpose of background subtraction .",

    "@xcite .",
    "dedicated empty - target subtraction runs were not necessary for the cd@xmath38 experiment , as no target container was used . in this case , the @xmath60 vertex position provided the means to identify whether the event originated from the graphite target , the deuterated polyethylene target , or elsewhere .",

    "the stt model @xcite predicts distributions narrower than the @xmath3c data for the two lower energy bins and it is the only one of the three phenomenological models that predicts a lower mass value than the data exhibit .",
    "this indicates that a model which incorporates both the nuclear binding effect of stt as well as the spectral function modifications of rcw - plm has the potential to provide the best description of the @xmath3c data .",
    "this very line of argument has already been raised by brown and rho @xcite in the context of recent results from rhic .",
    "the brown - rho scaling of medium - dependent masses @xmath78 is combined with the spectral function modification of rcw in a unified picture . in this case , the @xmath0 mass in the phenomenological lagrangian used by rcw is replaced with what is essentially the brown - rho scaling mass @xmath68 . for the temperatures and densities appropriate to this work , the two mechanisms push the @xmath0-mass in the same direction , and so result in a lower @xmath0 mass than either model alone predict , nearly doubling the density effect @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism for the dramatic helicity flip remains an open issue .",
    "these data do not support either transversely polarized @xmath76 or unpolarized @xmath0 production . either",
    "would have manifested as a @xmath79-like background associated with some strength at the central region of the cos@xmath69 distribution . in ref .",

    "an alternate explanation is that the sub - threshold reaction mechanism may be responsible for the observed helicity flip .",
    "finally , the production mechanism seems to depend on the nucleus in question .",

    "in - medium @xmath0 spectral functions were obtained @xcite for cold nuclear matter at three matter densities , @xmath81 and 1.0 , where @xmath13 indicates the standard nuclear density of 0.155 @xmath82 .",

    "the in - medium @xmath0 propagator for each density is given in matrix form as functions of invariant mass and three momentum @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the momentum of the @xmath0 with respect to the nuclear medium , @xmath85 for each simulated event , the tagged photon energy , @xmath6 mass @xmath73 , and reaction location within the nucleus were randomly chosen and an event generated via the quasi - free mechanism @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the participating struck proton with initial fermi momentum @xmath88 and the remainder of the nucleus is a spectator .",
    "it should not be necessary to consider any other kinematic channel , such as @xmath89 , as these are already taken into account via the in - medium spectral function . to do otherwise would lead to `` double counting '' of resonance effects .",

    "however , several theoretical models have all the right ingredients of @xmath8 medium modifications due to the interactions of pions and resonances with the nucleons and pions in the nucleus and these models do reproduce the vacuum spectral shape correctly .",
    "furthermore , while the average density of the deuteron is low , recent models utilizing modern @xmath18 potentials indicate that the deuteron is primarily a toroidal structure with a nearly hollow core and a maximum density of nearly 2 @xmath13 at @xmath98 fm . here , the @xmath99 and @xmath100-wave deuteron wave - functions from ref .",
    "@xcite using the argonne av18 potential were parameterized and used to calculate the @xmath101 state @xmath102 .",

    "first , it is used to select the appropriate spectral function @xmath103 for the event .",
    "second , the generated event is weighted according to the density at the reaction vertex , so that production at the diffuse edge of the nucleus is less probable than from the denser core , consistent with the requirement of a quasi - free reaction mechanism .    to determine @xmath84",
    ", the produced @xmath0 is lorentz - transformed to the struck proton plus recoil - fragment rest frame , thus specifying the @xmath0 propagator value for the event , @xmath104 .",
    "this value was incorporated into the statistical weight for the simulated event . as the spectral function varies rapidly with @xmath73 but slowly with @xmath105 and @xmath83 , the propagator was interpolated from the closest @xmath73 bin , but no interpolation was performed either over @xmath105 or @xmath83 .",
    "the simulated events were then tracked through the simulated experimental detectors and analyzed in the same manner as the data .",
    "the plm model was implemented in a manner similar to the rcw model . in this case , 15 in - medium propagators were provided @xcite in matrix form for nuclear densities from 0.1 to 1.5 @xmath13 . as with the rcw model , longitudinal , transverse and spin - averaged functions were provided , but only the result using the longitudinal spectral function is shown here . the propagators were provided as a function of @xmath6 energy @xmath106 in the nuclear medium rest frame , as well as @xmath0 invariant mass , @xmath107 and @xmath108 was interpolated from the closest @xmath73 bin , but no interpolation was done over @xmath106 or @xmath105 .",
