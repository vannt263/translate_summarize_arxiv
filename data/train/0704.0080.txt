    "the mass functions of star cluster systems provide an important point of reference for attempts to understand the connection between old globular clusters ( gcs ) and the young massive clusters that form in local starbursts and galaxy mergers . when expressed as the number per unit logarithmic mass , @xmath11 , the gc mass function ( gcmf )",
    "is characterized by a peak , or turnover , at a mass @xmath12@xmath13 that is empirically very similar in most galaxies . by contrast",
    ", the mass functions of young clusters show no such feature but instead rise monotonically towards low masses over the full observed range ( @xmath14 in the best - studied cases ) , in a way that is well described by a power law , @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the same time , for high @xmath17 , old gcmfs",

    "it is therefore natural to ask whether the peaks in gcmfs can be explained by the depletion over many gyr of globulars from initial mass distributions that were similar to those of young clusters below @xmath1 as well as above .",
    "our chief purpose in this paper is to establish and interpret an aspect of the galactic gcmf that appears fundamental but has gone largely unnoticed to date : @xmath11 has a strong and systematic dependence on gc half - mass density , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the cluster half - mass radius ) , in the sense that the turnover mass @xmath1 increases and the width of the distribution decreases with increasing @xmath0 . as observed facts ,",
    "these must be explained by any theory of the gcmf .",
    "we argue here that they are an expected signature of slow dynamical evolution from a mass function that initially increased towards @xmath20 , if the long - term mass loss from surviving gcs has been dominated by stellar escape due to internal , two - body relaxation ( which we refer to from now on as either relaxation - driven evaporation or simply evaporation ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter ) explain in detail why cluster evaporation dominates the long - term evolution of the low - mass shape of observable gcmfs .",
    "briefly , stellar evolution removes ( through supernovae and winds ) the same _ fraction _ of mass from all clusters of a given age , and so can not change the shape of @xmath11 ( unless special initial conditions are invoked ; cf .",
    "meanwhile , for gcs like those that have survived for a hubble time in the milky way , the mass loss from gravitational shocks during disk crossings and bulge passages is generally less than that due to evaporation for @xmath21 (; @xcite ) .    as we discuss further in ",
    "[ sec : results ] below , the evaporation of tidally limited clusters proceeds at a rate , @xmath22 , that is approximately constant in time and primarily determined by cluster density . show that a constant mass - loss rate leads to a power - law scaling @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( corresponding to a flat distribution of clusters per unit _ linear _ mass ) at sufficiently low @xmath25 in the evolved mass function of coeval gcs that began with _ any _ nontrivial initial @xmath26 . to accommodate this",
    "when @xmath26 originally increased towards low masses as a power law , a time - dependent peak must develop in the gcmf at a mass of order @xmath27 ( ) .",
    "but then , since @xmath10 depends fundamentally on cluster density , so too must @xmath1 .",
    "a @xmath28 power - law scaling below the turnover mass has been confirmed directly in the gcmfs of the milky way ( ) and the giant elliptical m87 @xcite , while @xcite show it to be consistent with @xmath11 data for 89 virgo cluster galaxies , and it is apparent in deep observations of some other gcmfs ( e.g. , in the sombrero galaxy , m104 ; @xcite ) . as regards the peak itself , old gcs are observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to have rather similar densities on average  and , therefore , similar typical @xmath10in galaxies with widely different total luminosities and hubble types .",
    "( inasmuch as cluster densities are set by tides , this is probably related to the mild variation of mean _ galaxy _ density with total luminosity ; see , and also @xcite . )",
    "thus , an evaporation - dominated evolutionary origin for a turnover in the gcmf appears to be consistent with the well - known fact that the mass scale @xmath1 generally differs very little among galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this picture is basically correct , it implies that , even though @xmath1 may appear nearly universal when considering the global mass functions of entire gc systems , in fact the gcmfs of subsamples of clusters with similar ages but different densities should have different turnovers . in  [ sec : results ] , we show  working for definiteness and relatively easy observability with the half - mass density , @xmath0that this is the case for globulars in the milky way .",
    "we fit the observed @xmath11 for gcs in bins of different @xmath0 with models assuming that ( 1 ) the initial distribution increased as a @xmath29 power law at low masses and ( 2 ) the mass - loss rates of individual clusters can be estimated from their half - mass densities by the rule @xmath30 . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the validity of this prescription for @xmath10 , which is certainly approximate but captures the main physical dependence of relaxation - driven mass loss . in particular , we show that the alternative mass - loss laws @xmath6 and @xmath7where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean volume and surface densities inside cluster tidal radii  lead to models for the gcmf that are essentially indistinguishable from those based on @xmath30 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath10 required to fit the observed gcmf implies cluster lifetimes that are within a factor of @xmath31 ( perhaps slightly on the low side , if the initial power - law exponent at low masses was @xmath29 ) of typical values in theories and simulations of two - body relaxation in tidally limited gcs .    we also show in  [ sec : results ] that when the observed densities of individual clusters are used in our models to predict gcmfs in different bins of galactocentric radius ( @xmath4 ) , they fit the much weaker variation of @xmath11 and @xmath1 as functions of @xmath4 , which is well - known in the milky way and other large galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , applying our models to the gcs in two bins of central concentration , with only the measured @xmath0 of the clusters in each subsample as input , suffices to account for previously noted differences between the mass functions of low- and high - concentration galactic globulars @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental feature of the gcmf therefore appears to be its dependence on cluster density , which can be understood at least qualitatively ( and even quantitatively , to within a factor of 2 ) in terms of evaporation - dominated cluster disruption .",
    "there is a widespread perception that if the gcmf evolved slowly from a rising power law at low masses , then a weak or null variation of @xmath1 with @xmath4 can be achieved only in gc systems with strongly radially anisotropic velocity distributions , which are not observed ( see especially @xcite ) .",
    "this apparent inconsistency has been cited to bolster some recent attempts to identify a mechanism by which a `` universal '' peak at @xmath32 might have been imprinted on the gcmf at the time of cluster formation , or very shortly afterwards , and little affected by the subsequent destruction of lower - mass gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the real successes of an evaporation - dominated evolutionary scenario for the origin of @xmath1 , as summarized above and added to below , it would be premature to reject the idea in favor of _ requiring _ a near - formation origin , solely on the basis of difficulties with gc kinematics .",
    "( and , in any event , formation - oriented models must now be reconsidered in light of the _ non_-universality of @xmath1 as a function of cluster density . )",
    "we are not concerned in this paper with velocity anisotropy in gc systems , because we only predict an evaporation - evolved @xmath11 as a function of cluster density ( and age ) and take the observed distribution of @xmath0 versus @xmath4 in the milky way as a given , to show consistency with the observed behavior of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "most other models (;",
    "@xcite ; and references therein ) predict dynamically evolved gcmfs directly in terms of @xmath4 , and in doing so are forced also to derive theoretical dependences of cluster density on @xmath4 .",
    "it is only at this stage that gc orbital distributions enter the problem , and then only in conjunction with several other assumptions and simplifications . as we discuss further in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] below , the radially biased gc velocity distributions that appear in such models could well be consequences of one or more of these other assumptions , rather than of the main hypothesis about evaporation - dominated gcmf evolution .",
    "in this section we define and model the dependence of the galactic gcmf on cluster density .",
    "first , we describe the dependence that is expected to arise from evaporation - dominated evolution .",
    "two - body relaxation in a tidally limited gc leads to a roughly steady rate of mass loss , @xmath33 in time .",
    "thus , the total cluster mass decreases approximately linearly , as @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior is exact in some classic models of gc evolution @xcite and is found to be a good approximation in most other calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the result comes from a variety of computational methods ( semi - analytical , fokker - planck , monte carlo , and @xmath35-body simulation ) applied to clusters with different initial conditions ( densities and concentrations ) on different kinds of orbits ( circular and eccentric ; with and without external gravitational shocks ) and with different internal processes and ingredients ( with or without stellar mass spectra , binaries , and central black holes ) . to be sure , deviations from perfect linearity in @xmath36 do occur , but these are generally small  especially away from the endpoints of the evolution , i.e. , for @xmath37and neglecting them to assume an approximately constant @xmath38 is entirely appropriate for our purposes .    when gravitational shocks are subdominant to relaxation - driven evaporation , as they generally appear to be for extant gcs , they work to boost the mass - loss rate @xmath10 slightly without altering the basic linearity of @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite",
    "; see also figure 1 of ) . a time - dependent mass scale @xmath39",
    "is then associated naturally with any system of coeval clusters having a common mass - loss rate : all those with initial @xmath40 are disrupted by time @xmath41 , and replaced with the remnants of objects that began with @xmath42 . as we mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , if the initial gcmf increased towards low masses as a power law , then @xmath43 is closely related to a peak in the evolved distribution , which eventually decreases towards low @xmath44 as @xmath15 with @xmath45 ( ) .    in standard theory ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , section 8.3 ) , the lifetime of a cluster against evaporation is a multiple of its two - body relaxation time , @xmath46 . for a total mass @xmath47 of stars within a radius @xmath48 ,",
    "this scales to first order ( ignoring a weak mass dependence in the coulomb logarithm ) as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . in a concentrated cluster with an internal density gradient ,",
    "@xmath51 of course varies throughout the cluster , and the global relaxation timescale is an average of the local values ( see the early discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "this can still be written as @xmath52 , with @xmath47 the total cluster mass and @xmath53 an appropriate reference density .",
    "we then have for the instantaneous mass - loss rate , @xmath54 .",
    "insofar as this is approximately constant in time , a gcmf evolving from an initial @xmath55 power law at low masses should therefore develop a peak at a mass that depends on cluster density and age through the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "it remains to identify the best measure of @xmath53 in this context .",
    "a standard choice in the literature , and the one that we eventually make to derive our main results in this paper , is the half - mass density @xmath57 .",
    "however , in a steady tidal field , the mean density @xmath8 inside the tidal radius of a cluster is constant by definition , and thus choosing @xmath58 instead is the simplest way to ensure that @xmath59 and @xmath60 in time are mutually consistent .",
    "in fact , @xcite found from direct calculations of the escape rate at each radius within his standard ( lowered maxwellian ) models , that the coefficient in @xmath6 is only a weak function of the internal density structure ( concentration ) of the models , and thus only a weak function of time for a cluster evolving quasistatically through a series of such models .",
    "the rule @xmath6 is routinely used to set the gc mass - loss rates in models for the dynamical evolution of the gcmf , although such studies normally express @xmath10 immediately in terms of orbital pericenters , @xmath61 , most often by assuming @xmath62 as for gcs in galaxies whose total mass distributions follow a singular isothermal sphere ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "this bypasses any explicit examination of the gcmf as a function of cluster density , which is our main goal in this paper .",
    "but it is done in part because tidal radii are the most poorly constrained of all structural parameters for gcs in the milky way ( their theoretical definition is imprecise and their empirical estimation is highly model - dependent and sensitive to low - surface brightness data ) , and they are exceedingly difficult if not impossible to measure in distant galaxies",
    ". we deal with this here by focusing on the gcmf as a function of cluster density @xmath0 inside the less ambiguous , empirically better determined and more robust half - mass radius , asking how simple models with @xmath30 fare against the data .",
    "taking @xmath30 in place of @xmath6 , which we do to construct evaporation - evolved model gcmfs in  [ subsec : models ] , is most appropriate if the ratio @xmath63 is the same for all clusters and constant in time .",
    "this is the case in @xcite s ( @xcite ) model of gc evolution , and in this limit ( adopted by in their models for the galactic gcmf ) our analysis is rigorously justified .",
    "however , real clusters are not homologous ( @xmath63 differs among clusters ) and they do not evolve self - similarly ( @xmath0 may vary in time even if @xmath8 does not ) .",
    "the key assumption in our models is that @xmath10 is approximately independent of time for any gc , which is well - founded in any case . by using current @xmath0 values to estimate @xmath10",
    ", we do _ not _ suppose that the half - mass densities are also constant , but we in effect use a single number for all gcs to represent a range of @xmath64 .",
    "equivalently , we ignore a dependence on cluster concentration in the normalization of @xmath30 . as we discuss",
    "further in  [ sec : discussion ] , it is reasonable to neglect this complication in a first approximation because @xmath64 varies much less among galactic globulars than @xmath8 and @xmath0 do separately .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly by repeating our analysis with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath8 and recover essentially the same results for the gcmf .    in  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we also discuss some recent results , which indicate that the timescale for relaxation - driven evaporation depends on a slightly less - than - linear power of @xmath46 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that this implies that @xmath10 may increase as a modest power of the average _ surface _ density of a cluster as well as ( or , in an important special case , instead of ) the usual volume density .",
    "however , we show in detail that making the appropriate changes throughout the rest of the present section to reflect this possibility does not change any of our conclusions .      figure [ fig : rhoh ] shows the distribution of mass against half - mass density and against galactocentric radius for 146 milky way gcs in the catalogue of @xcite , along with the distribution of @xmath0 versus @xmath4 linking the two mass plots .",
    "the @xcite catalogue actually records the absolute @xmath65 magnitudes of the gcs .",
    "we obtain masses from these by applying the population - synthesis model mass - to - light ratios @xmath66 computed by @xcite for individual clusters based on their metallicities and an assumed age of 13 gyr . however , we first multiplied all of the @xcite @xmath66 values by a factor of 0.8 so as to obtain a median @xmath67 in the end , consistent with direct dynamical estimates ( see @xcite and @xcite ; also @xcite ) .    by assigning mass - to - light ratios to gcs in this way",
    ", we allow for expected differences between clusters with different metallicities . our application of a corrective factor to the population - synthesis values , @xmath68 , is motivated empirically by the fact that their distribution among galactic gcs is strongly peaked around a median @xmath69 , while the observed ( dynamical ) @xmath70 lie in a fairly narrow range around @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the size of this difference is similar to what is found in some numerical simulations of two - body relaxation over a hubble time in clusters with a spectrum of stellar masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in such simulations",
    ", @xmath70 falls below @xmath68 due to the preferential escape of low - mass stars with high individual @xmath72 ( population - synthesis models do not incorporate this or any other stellar - dynamical effect ) .",
    "thus , a median @xmath73 may itself be a signature of cluster evaporation .",
    "we might then also expect that more dynamically evolved clusters  that is , those with shorter relaxation times  could have systematically lower ratios of @xmath74 .",
    "however , this is a relatively small effect , which is not well quantified theoretically and is not clearly evident in real data ( the numbers published by @xcite show no significant correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 for galactic globulars ) .",
    "we therefore proceed , as stated , with a single @xmath76 assumed for all gcs .",
    "@xcite gives the projected half - light radius @xmath77 for 141 of the clusters with a mass estimated in this way , and for these we obtain the three - dimensional half - mass radius from the general rule @xmath78 ( @xcite ) , which assumes no internal mass segregation .",
    "the remaining five objects have mass estimates but no size measurements .",
    "to each of these clusters , we assign an @xmath19 equal to the median value for those of the other 141 gcs having masses within a factor two of the one with unknown @xmath19 . in all cases ,",
    "the half - mass density is @xmath18 .",
    "the leftmost panel in figure [ fig : rhoh ] shows immediately that the cluster mass distribution has a strong dependence on half - mass density : the median @xmath79 increases with @xmath0 while the scatter in @xmath80that is , the width of the gcmf  decreases .",
    "the first of these points is related to the fact that @xmath19 correlates poorly with @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the second point , that the dispersion of @xmath11 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , is behind the finding ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that the gcmf is broader at very large galactocentric radii .",
    "we return to this in  [ subsec : models ] .    a natural concern , when plotting @xmath47 against @xmath0 as we have done here , is that any apparent correlation might only be a trivial reflection of the definition @xmath81 .",
    "this may seem particularly worrisome because , as we just mentioned , it is known that size does not correlate especially well with mass for gcs in the milky way ( or , indeed , in other galaxies ) .",
    "however , the lack of a tight @xmath47@xmath19 correlation does _ not _ imply that all gcs have _ the same _ @xmath19 , even within the unavoidable measurement errors .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter of @xmath82 about its average value is @xmath83 for galactic gcs , and the 68-percentile spread in @xmath82 is slightly greater than 0.5 , or more than a factor of 3 in linear terms ( from the data in @xcite ; see , e.g. , figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "this compares to an rms random measurement error ( from formal , @xmath84 fitting uncertainties ) of @xmath85 , or about 10% relative error ; and an rms systematic measurement error ( i.e. , differences in the @xmath19 inferred from fitting different structural models to a single cluster ) of perhaps @xmath86 ; see @xcite .",
    "most of the scatter in plots of observed half - light radius versus mass is therefore real and contains physical information .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : rhoh ] displays this information in a form that highlights clear , nontrivial overall trends requiring physical explanation .",

    "insofar as the half - mass relaxation time scales as @xmath116 , and to the extent that @xmath117 approximates the average rate of relaxation - driven mass loss , this line is one of equal evaporation time .",
    "that such a locus nicely bounds the lower envelope of the observed cluster distribution is itself a strong hint that relaxation - driven cluster disruption has significantly modified the gcmf at low masses ( recall that @xmath115 defines one side of the gc `` survival triangle '' when the @xmath47@xmath0 plot is recast as @xmath19 versus @xmath47 : @xcite ) .",
    "it is also further evidence that the weak correlation of observed @xmath19 with @xmath47 is due to significant and real differences in cluster radii , since if @xmath19 were intrinsically the same for all gcs , then we would see @xmath118 instead .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : rhoh ] shows the well - known result that the typical gc mass depends weakly if at all on galactocentric radius , at least until large @xmath11940  kpc , where there are too few clusters to discern any trend .",
    "the right - hand panel of the figure shows why this is true even though the gcmf depends significantly on cluster density : although there is a correlation between half - mass density and galactocentric position , the large scatter about it is such that convolving the observed @xmath47 versus @xmath0 with the observed @xmath0 versus @xmath4 results in an almost null dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath4 .",
    "we now divide the gc sample in figure [ fig : rhoh ] roughly into thirds , in two different ways : first on the basis of half - mass density , and second by galactocentric radius .",

    "the curves in the figure trace model gcmfs , which we describe in  [ subsec : models ] . for the moment , it is important to note that the dashed curve is the same in every panel , apart from minor differences in normalization , and is proportional to the gcmf for the whole sample of 146 gcs .",
    "( in the middle - left panel of figure [ fig : gclf ] , which pertains to clusters distributed tightly around the median @xmath0 of the entire gc system , the dashed curve is coincident with the solid curve running through the data . )",
    "the left - hand panels of figure [ fig : gclf ] show directly that the gcmf is peaked for clusters at any density , and that the mass of the peak increases systematically with @xmath0 ( see also the last column of table [ tab : bins ] , but note that the turnover masses there refer to the _ model _ gcmfs that we develop below ) .",
    "the statistical significance of this is very high , and qualitatively it is the behavior expected if @xmath1 owes its existence to cluster disruption at a rate that increases with @xmath0 , as is the case with relaxation - driven evaporation .",
    "the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : gclf ] confirm once again that the gcmf peak mass is a very weak function of galactocentric position .",
    "in fact , the observed distributions in the two @xmath4 bins inside @xmath120  kpc are statistically indistinguishable in their entirety , and the main difference at larger @xmath121  kpc is a slightly higher proportion of low - mass clusters rather than a large change in @xmath1 .",
    "all of this is consistent with the primary dependence of the gcmf being that on @xmath0 , since figure [ fig : rhoh ] shows that the gc density distribution is not sensitive to galactocentric position for @xmath12220  kpc but has a substantial low - density tail at larger radii ( with a broader associated gcmf , as seen in the upper - left panel of figure [ fig : gclf ] ) .",
    "we now assess more quantitatively whether these results are consistent with evaporation - dominated evolution of the gcmf from an initial distribution like that observed for young clusters in the local universe .",

    "we assume that the initial gcmf was independent of cluster density , and that all globulars surviving to the present day have been losing mass for the past hubble time at constant rates .",
    "we use the _ current _ half - mass density of each cluster to _ estimate _",
    "as we discussed earlier , an approximately time - independent @xmath10 is indicated by most calculations of two - body relaxation in tidally limited gcs .",

    "if the gcmf evolved dynamically from initial conditions similar to those we have adopted , then the data and models in the left - hand panels of figure [ fig : gclf ] argue against the notion that external gravitational shocks , rather than internal two - body relaxation , were primarily responsible for shaping the present - day gcmf .",
    "this is because the mass - loss rate caused by shocks alone , @xmath175 , differs significantly from that caused by evaporation alone , @xmath5 .",
    "the direct dependence of @xmath176 on @xmath47 ensures that shocks become progressively less important compared to evaporation as clusters lose mass ( at a given @xmath0 ) , and consequently shocks are not likely to have had much effect on the observed gcmf for @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the inverse dependence of @xmath176 on @xmath0 is contrary to the direct dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath0 shown in figure [ fig : gclf ] .",
    "the different roles played by shocks and evaporation in shaping the observed gcmf are discussed more fully by .",
    "we note here that gravitational shocks may have been important in destroying very massive or very low - density clusters early in the history of our galaxy .",
    "if the current shape of the gcmf is fundamentally the result of long - term cluster disruption according to a mass - loss rule like @xmath30 , then it should be possible to reproduce the distribution as a function of any other cluster attribute by using the observed @xmath0 of individual gcs in equations ( [ eq : compschec ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) to build model @xmath11 for subsamples of the galactic cluster system defined by that attribute  as we did for the @xmath4 binning of  [ subsec : models ] . here",

    "these models peak at @xmath185 for the @xmath177 subsample but at @xmath186 for @xmath178 , entirely as a result of the different @xmath0 involved",
    ". the larger width of @xmath11 and its shallower slope at any @xmath187 for the low - concentration gcs are also clear , in the model curves as well as the data .",
    "it is further evident that there are no low-@xmath3 galactic globulars observed with @xmath188 , above the nominal turnover of the full gcmf ( as @xcite noted ) .",
    "but this is not surprising , given that there are so few low - concentration clusters in total and they are expected to be dominated by low - mass objects because of their generally low densities .",
    "thus , the solid curve in figure [ fig : conc ] predicts perhaps @xmath189 high - mass clusters with @xmath177 , where none is found .",
    "the apparent variation of the milky way gcmf with internal concentration is therefore consistent with the same density - based model for evaporation - dominated dynamical evolution that we compared to @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath4 in  [ subsec : models ] . to show this , we have made use of the densities @xmath0 exactly as observed within the two concentration bins indicated in figure [ fig : conc]just as we also took @xmath0 directly from the data for gcs in different ranges of @xmath4 to construct models for comparison with the observed @xmath11 in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : gclf ]",

    "we obtained the normalization of @xmath30 in  [ subsec : models ] by fitting to observed gcmfs constructed by applying a specific mass - to - light ratio @xmath66 to every cluster , with models assuming a specific form for the initial @xmath26 .",

    "the strongest observational constraints on the normalizations of @xmath43 and @xmath10 come from the low - density clusters .",

    ", a cluster loses 4.5% of its remaining mass every half - mass relaxation time .",
    "the time to complete disruption is therefore @xmath214 . for non - homologous clusters in a steady tidal field ,",
    "@xmath198 is a function of central concentration and can differ from the @xcite value by factors of about two . from one - dimensional fokker - planck calculations",
    ", @xcite find @xmath21540 for @xcite model clusters with @xmath3 values similar to those found in real gcs and with gravitational shocks suppressed ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "thus , even though the evaporation time in equation ( [ eq : tdis ] ) may be slightly shorter than is typically found in theoretical calculations , it is certainly within the range of such calculations .",
    "moreover , the assumptions of a steady tidal field and a single stellar mass in @xcite and @xcite are important",
    ". part of the difference between the typical lifetimes in these particular theoretical treatments and our estimate of @xmath198 from the gcmf is that the former do not include gravitational shocks , which may have accelerated somewhat the evolution of real clusters ( although we stress again that shocks do not appear in general to have dominated the evolution of extant galactic gcs and are not expected to affect the basic time - independence of the net mass - loss rate ; see @xcite , @xcite , , and @xcite ) .",
    "a spectrum of stellar masses in the clusters may also have contributed to an increase in evaporation rate over the single - mass values ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "estimates of evaporation times from other numerical methods and for models of multimass clusters can be rather sensitive to the detailed computational techniques and input assumptions and approximations , and differences at roughly the factor - of - two level in @xmath198 between different analyses are not uncommon ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "thus , although the lifetimes in these studies tend to be broadly comparable to those in @xcite and @xcite , noticeably shorter values do occur in some models .",
    "in any case , we are encouraged by consistency to within factors of two or three between estimates of @xmath191 or @xmath10 by such vastly different methods ",
    "one purely observational , based on the mass functions of cluster systems ; the other purely theoretical , based on idealized models for the evolution of individual clusters  particularly since each method involves several uncertain inputs and parameters .",
    "the dimensionless disruption time in equation ( [ eq : tdis ] ) is independent of any cluster property other than the coulomb logarithm because we have used gc half - mass densities to estimate @xmath216 , while @xmath75 also scales as @xmath217 .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , the fokker - planck calculations of @xcite in particular show that @xmath198 is actually a function of central concentration , @xmath3 , for @xcite model clusters in steady tidal fields .",
    "the constant of proportionality in @xmath30 should therefore also depend on @xmath3 , a detail that we have neglected to this point .",
    "we show now that this has not biased any of our analysis or affected our conclusions .",
    "the dotted curve in figure [ fig : life ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath198 on @xmath3 for single - mass @xcite models , as given by equation ( 30 ) of @xcite .",
    "the solid curve is proportional to @xmath218 , which we have calculated as a function of @xmath3 for these models and multiplied by a constant to compare directly with @xmath198 .",
    "evidently , there is an approximate equality @xmath219 , which holds to within @xmath220 over the range of concentrations shown in figure [ fig : life ] ( note that all but 6 galactic gcs have @xmath221 , corresponding to central potentials @xmath222 ) .",
    "thus , if the evaporation time is written as @xmath223 , then the constant of proportionality in the mass - loss rate @xmath224 should be nearly independent of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , @xcite originally concluded , from quite basic arguments , that the evaporation rate of a cluster with a lowered - maxwellian velocity distribution would take the form @xmath6 with only a weak dependence on @xmath3 . an essentially concentration - independent scaling of @xmath10 with @xmath225 is also found in @xmath35-body simulations of tidally limited , multimass clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) and so is not an artifact of any assumptions specific to the calculations of either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this suggests that it might have been more natural to specify cluster evaporation rates proportional to @xmath225 rather than @xmath156 when developing our gcmf models in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "for any cluster in a steady tidal field , with a constant @xmath8 , such a choice would also have been automatically consistent with an approximately time - independent @xmath10 and the corresponding linear @xmath36 dependence that we have adopted throughout this paper .",
    "as we discussed at the beginning of  [ sec : results ] , our decision to work with @xmath0 rather than @xmath8 was motivated by the fact that the half - mass density is much better defined in principle and more accurately observed in practice .",
    "nevertheless , re - writing @xmath6 as @xmath226 makes it clear that the validity of our models , with a fixed coefficient in @xmath30 , depends on the extent to which variations in @xmath64 can safely be ignored .",
    "figure [ fig : life ] shows that the full range of possible values for @xmath227 in @xcite - model clusters with @xmath228 is only a factor of @xmath229 between minimum and maximum .",
    "therefore , using a single , intermediate value of this density ratio to describe all gcs ( or a single gc evolving in time through a series of quasi - static @xcite models)which we have effectively done by using a gcmf fit to normalize @xmath43 and @xmath10 in equations ( [ eq : delta ] ) and ( [ eq : muev])should never be in error by more than a factor of 2 or so .",
    "this is a relatively small inaccuracy , given that measured gc densities range over four to five orders of magnitude .    to confirm",
    "more directly that our models with @xmath30 are good approximations to gcmf evolution under a mass - loss law @xmath6 , we have repeated the analysis of  [ sec : results ] in full but using the gc tidal densities @xmath8 ( derived from the values of @xmath180 listed by @xcite ) in place of @xmath0 throughout .",
    "all of our main results persist .",
    "for example , the two panels of figure [ fig : rhot ] , which are analogous to the left- and rightmost panels of figure [ fig : rhoh ] above , show that ( 1 ) the gc mass distribution has a clear dependence on @xmath8 , with a lower envelope that is well matched by a line of constant evaporation time , @xmath230 ( the dashed line in the plot ) ; and ( 2 ) although the scatter in the distribution of @xmath8 over galactocentric radius is smaller than the scatter in @xmath0 versus @xmath4 , it is still significant . because the @xmath47@xmath4 distribution can now be viewed as the convolution of the @xmath47@xmath8 distribution with the @xmath8@xmath4 distribution , the scatter in @xmath8 versus @xmath4 is again critical in explaining the weak or null dependence of the gcmf on galactocentric radius .",
    "( the @xmath47@xmath4 distribution is , of course , unchanged from that shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : rhoh ] . )",
    "figure [ fig : rhot_gclf ] shows the milky way gcmf for globulars in three equally populated bins of tidal density ( defined as indicated in the left - hand panels of the plot ) and in the same three bins of galactocentric radius that we used in  [ subsec : models ] above .",
    "our models for these distributions are based as before on equation ( [ eq : compschec ] ) with @xmath29 , but now the total mass lost from any gc is estimated from its tidal density rather than its half - mass density . specifically , we take @xmath231 the numerical coefficient in equation ( [ eq : deltat ] ) is such that it gives a @xmath43 identical to that in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) for a gc with @xmath232 , which is the median value of this density ratio for the 146 gcs in the @xcite catalogue .    as in figure",
    "[ fig : gclf ] , the dashed curve in every panel of figure [ fig : rhot_gclf ] is the same , representing a fit to the average @xmath11 of the entire galactic gc system .",
    "thus , it is immediately clear that the peak mass of the gcmf increases significantly and systematically with increasing @xmath8 , just as it does with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "meanwhile , the solid curves are subsample - specific model gcmfs , obtained by using the observed tidal density of each cluster in any @xmath8 or @xmath4 bin to specify individual @xmath43 values via equation ( [ eq : deltat ] ) for each of the evolved @xcite functions in the summation of equation ( [ eq : compschec ] ) .",
    "as expected , there is no appreciable difference , in terms of the fits to any of the observed gcmfs , between these models based on evaporation rates @xmath6 and our original models with @xmath30 .",
    "another potential concern comes from recent arguments ( see especially @xcite ) that the total evaporation time of a tidally limited cluster is not simply a multiple of an internal two - body relaxation time , @xmath233 , but depends on both @xmath46 and the crossing time @xmath234 through the combination @xmath235 , with @xmath236 .",
    "the mass - loss rate @xmath237 then scales as @xmath238 , which for @xmath239 differs from the rates @xmath30 and @xmath6 that we have so far adopted . however , our gcmf models are still meaningful , because postulating @xmath235 implies a dependence of @xmath10 on a measure of cluster density that is , once again ,",
    "well _ approximated _ by @xmath156 for galactic gcs . before showing this , we briefly discuss the reasons and the evidence for a possible dependence of @xmath191 on both @xmath46 and @xmath240 .",
    "if stars are assumed to escape a cluster as soon as they have attained energies above some critical value as a result of two - body relaxation , then @xmath241 is expected ( and confirmed by @xmath35-body simulations ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , more complicated behavior may arise when escape not only depends on stars satisfying such an energy criterion , but also requires them to cross a spatial boundary . then , although the stars are still scattered to near- and above - escape energies on the timescale @xmath46 , they require some additional time to actually leave the cluster . this escape timescale is related fundamentally to @xmath240 ( but also depends on details of the stellar orbits , the external tidal field , and the shape of the zero - energy surface ) .",
    "the longer this extra time , the higher is the probability that further encounters with bound cluster stars may scatter any potential escapers back down to sub - escape energies .",
    "the net result is a slow - down ( `` retardation '' ) of the overall evaporation rate @xcite and a lengthening of the cluster lifetime @xmath191 , by a factor that can be expected to increase with the ratio @xmath242 .",
    "if this factor scales as @xmath243 for some @xmath244 , then @xmath245 .    while such a retardation of evaporation can be expected to occur at some level in all clusters , there are physical subtleties in the effect that are probably not captured adequately by a simple re - parametrization of lifetimes as @xmath235 .",
    "in particular , it is unlikely that this expression can hold for clusters of all masses with a single value of @xmath244 .",
    "since @xmath246 , very massive clusters have @xmath247 , and stars scattered to greater than escape energies by relaxation cross the tidal boundary effectively instantaneously  implying that the standard @xmath241 , or @xmath248 , applies in the high - mass limit . indeed ,",
    "if this were not the case , and a fixed @xmath244 held for all @xmath47 , then an unphysical @xmath249 would obtain at high enough masses ; see @xcite for further discussion .",
    "unfortunately , `` very massive '' is not well quantified in this context , and it is not yet clear if a single value of @xmath250 is accurate for the entire gc mass regime .",
    "so far , it has been checked directly only for initial cluster masses below the current peak of the gcmf .",
    "it is also worth noting that the analysis and simulations aimed at this problem to date have dealt with clusters on circular or moderately eccentric orbits in galactic potentials that are static and spherical .",
    "this means that any tidal perturbations felt by stars within the clusters are relatively weak and/or slow compared to their own orbital periods , leading to nearly adiabatic or at least non - impulsive responses . in more realistic situations , the galactic potential would be time - dependent and non - spherical and there might be additional tidal perturbations , including disk and bulge shocks .",
    "these perturbations could in some cases _ accelerate _ the escape of weakly bound stars from the clusters and thus counteract the retardation effect to some degree .",
    "further study is therefore needed to determine the regime of validity of the formula @xmath235 and its possible modification outside this regime .",
    "in the meantime , @xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter ) have fitted this formula to the lifetimes of a suite of @xmath35-body clusters with initial masses @xmath251 and several different initial concentrations and orbital eccentricities .",
    "at first write @xmath191 in terms of the relaxation and crossing times of clusters at their half - mass radii , so that @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 ( see their equation [ 5 ] ) . however , they immediately take a factor of @xmath255 out from the normalization of this scaling  in effect to obtain @xmath256 with a different constant of proportionality  and then use a simple definition of the tidal radius ( their equation [ 1 ] , @xmath257 , which is appropriate for a circular orbit of radius @xmath61 in a logarithmic potential with circular speed @xmath258 ; see @xcite ) to obtain the total lifetime of a cluster as a function of its initial mass , perigalactic distance , and @xmath258 ( their equation [ 7 ] ) . a single exponent @xmath259 and a single normalization in this function then suffice to predict to within 10% the lifetimes of the simulated clusters , regardless of their initial concentrations . by implication , if @xmath46 and @xmath240 were fixed at @xmath19 rather than @xmath180 , then @xmath191 _ would _ have an additional concentration dependence , related to the ratio @xmath255very similar to what we discussed in ",
    "[ subsubsec : rhvrt ] for the case @xmath260 .",
    "we now re - examine the milky way gcmf in terms of this prescription for retarded evaporation ( bearing in mind the caveats mentioned above ) . to avoid any explicit dependences on concentration",
    ", we also focus on the tidal radius and write @xmath256 for general @xmath261 ; but we do not substitute a potential- and orbit - specific formula for @xmath180 in terms of @xmath61 and galactic properties such as @xmath258 . instead , to keep the emphasis entirely on cluster densities , we re - write the scaling of the lifetime in terms of the mean _ surface _ density inside the tidal radius , @xmath262 , and the corresponding volume density @xmath263 .",
    "this leads to @xmath264 , which then implies @xmath265 clearly , the standard @xmath6 , which we have already discussed , is recovered for @xmath260 ; while for @xmath266 , we have the equally straightforward @xmath7 .",
    "find that , even with the retarded evaporation implied by @xmath259 , the masses of their simulated clusters still decrease approximately linearly with time after stellar - evolution effects ( which are only important for the first few @xmath267  yr ) are separated out ; see especially their figure 6 , equation ( 12 ) , and related discussion .",
    "thus , if the gcmf initially rose towards low masses and has been eroded by slow , relaxation - driven cluster destruction , then in this modified description of evaporation we might expect the current mass function to depend fundamentally on @xmath9 rather than @xmath0 or @xmath8 . but because @xmath36 still decreases nearly linearly with @xmath41 , only now with @xmath7 for each cluster , the shape of the evolved gcmf and its dependence on @xmath9 should resemble our earlier results for @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "we have confirmed this expectation by repeating all of our analyses in  [ sec : results ] again , now using @xmath268 to estimate cluster mass - loss rates .",
    "as before , we calculate @xmath9 from the data in the @xcite catalogue , although we caution once more that the tidal radii , and thus the derived @xmath9 , are more uncertain than @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : sigt ] , which should be compared to figures [ fig : rhoh ] and [ fig : rhot ] above , shows that the average galactic gc mass increases systematically with @xmath9 ; that the lower envelope of the @xmath47@xmath9 distribution is described well by @xmath269 ( the dashed line in the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : sigt ] ) , which is a locus of constant lifetime against evaporation for @xmath7 ; and that the scatter in the distribution of cluster @xmath9 versus galactocentric radius ( right - hand panel of the figure ) is substantial , as required to account for the almost non - existent correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath4 .",
    "the left - hand side of figure [ fig : sigt_gclf ] shows the mass functions of globulars in three bins of @xmath9 , as defined in each panel .",
    "the right - hand side of the figure shows @xmath11 in the same three intervals of @xmath4 as in figures [ fig : gclf ] and [ fig : rhot_gclf ] above . as in those earlier plots ,",
    "the dashed curve in all panels of figure [ fig : sigt_gclf ] is a model gcmf with the same parameters in every case , representing the mass function of the entire galactic gc system . once again , compared to the average @xmath1 , the observed turnover mass is significantly lower for clusters in the lowest @xmath9 bin and higher for clusters in the highest @xmath9 bin , while the width of @xmath11 decreases noticeably as @xmath9 increases .",
    "the solid curves in figure [ fig : sigt_gclf ] are again different in every panel .",
    "they are the sums of evaporation - evolved @xcite functions as in equation ( [ eq : compschec ] ) , with the usual @xmath29 assumed but with total mass losses estimated individually for each gc in any @xmath9 or @xmath4 bin according to @xmath270 rather than @xmath171 or @xmath271 . however , it turns out not to be necessary to change the _ normalization _ of @xmath171 in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) to achieve good fits to the observed gcmf as a function of either @xmath9 or @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in figure [ fig : sigt_gclf ] we have simply used @xmath272    the fits of these models , based on @xmath273 with @xmath274 , are indistinguishable from the fits of our original models based on the standard @xmath241 , i.e. , @xmath260 .",
    "( we have confirmed that adopting individual @xmath43 given by equation [ [ eq : deltasig ] ] also reproduces the gcmfs of low - and high - concentration gcs in figure [ fig : conc ] as well as before . )",
    "it was somewhat unexpected that equation ( [ eq : deltasig ] ) and equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) should have the same numerical coefficient , but we note that this follows empirically from the fact that the measured @xmath0 and @xmath9 of galactic gcs are consistent with the simple near - equality , @xmath275 in the mean .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : rhoh_sig ] , which also shows that there is significant scatter about the relation .",
    "however , this scatter does not correlate with cluster mass or galactocentric radius . from a pragmatic point of view , therefore , @xmath156 and @xmath276 are near enough to interchangeable for our purposes , and there is no practical difference between gcmf models based on one or the other measure of gc density .",
    "one further check on this is to verify that the mass - loss rate associated with equation ( [ eq : deltasig ] ) is roughly in keeping with that implied by the @xmath35-body simulations pointing to @xmath277 in the first place .",
    "thus , we compare the rate @xmath278 to a formula implicit in . starting with their equation ( 7 ) for the lifetime",

    "] this is appropriate for clusters that just fill their roche lobes at perigalacticon , which is where @xmath287 is specified .",
    "the factor of 0.7 in the first equality accounts for mass loss due to stellar evolution in the simulations , which , as they discuss , can be treated as having occurred almost immediately and in full at the beginning of a cluster s life .",
    "our gcmf - based @xmath10 is a factor of @xmath288 faster than the @xmath35-body value for clusters on circular orbits ( with @xmath289 and in steady tidal fields ) in the simulations ; and our @xmath10 is still within a factor of about three of the @xmath35-body rate for clusters on eccentric orbits with @xmath290 in ( @xmath2910.6 is typical for tracers with an isotropic velocity distribution in a logarithmic potential ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is very similar to the comparison of lifetimes in  [ subsec : lifetime ] for our original models based on @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , our new estimate of @xmath10 and that in are still subject to their own , separate uncertainties and reflect different idealizations and assumptions . for example , our rate still depends on the exact power - law exponent @xmath137 at low masses in the initial gcmf , as discussed after equation ( [ eq : tdis_scale ] ) ; while the rate from still neglects gravitational shocks from disk crossings and passages by a discrete galactic bulge , and may additionally be biased low for @xmath292 if @xmath293 at such masses . all of this  not to mention again the large uncertainties and possible systematics in the estimates of tidal radii needed to calculate @xmath9makes the near agreement between equations ( [ eq : muevsig ] ) and ( [ eq : muev_bm03 ] ) more striking than any apparent discrepancy .    in summary , although the relation @xmath294 in time is rigorously correct only in rather specific circumstances , our gcmf models based on it in  [ sec : results ] are good proxies , in all respects , for models based on other plausible characterizations of relaxation - driven cluster mass loss .",
    "this result will likely be important for future studies of the mass functions of extragalactic cluster systems , where it may well be necessary to adopt procedures based on @xmath0 rather than @xmath8 or @xmath9 because of the difficulty or impossibility of estimating tidal radii .      in this paper",
    "we have directly modeled @xmath11 as a function only of gc density and age , and used the observed @xmath0 ( or @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ) of clusters in relatively narrow ranges of galactocentric position to show that such models are consistent with the current near - constancy of the gcmf as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "most other models in the literature for evaporation - dominated gcmf evolution , in either the milky way or other galaxies , instead predict the distribution explicitly as a function of @xmath4 at any time .",
    "they therefore need , in effect , to derive theoretical density ",
    "position relations for clusters in galaxies alongside their main gcmf calculations .",
    "this usually begins with the adoption of analytical potentials to describe the parent galaxies of gcs .",
    "taking these to be spherical and static for a hubble time allows the use of standard tidal - limitation formulae to write gc densities ab initio in terms of the ( fixed ) pericenters @xmath61 of unique orbits in the adopted potentials .",
    "cluster relaxation times and mass - loss rates @xmath10 then follow as functions of @xmath61 as well .",
    "finally , specific initial mass , space , and velocity ( or orbital eccentricity ) distributions are chosen for entire gc systems , so that at all later times it is known what the dynamically evolved @xmath11 is for globulars with any single @xmath61 ; how many clusters with a given @xmath61 survive ; and what the distributions of @xmath61 and all dependent cluster properties are at any instantaneous position @xmath4 .    in this approach ,",
    "if the gcmf began with a power - law rise towards low masses and its current peak is due entirely to cluster disruption , then a dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath61 is expected in general , because the densities of tidally limited gcs decrease with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "thus , models along these lines that assume the orbit distribution of a gc system to be the same at all radii in a galaxy ( i.e. , that the time average of the ratio @xmath295 is independent of position ) have typically had difficulty in accounting for the observed weak or non - correlation between @xmath1 and present @xmath4 in large galaxies .",
    "this is particularly a problem if it is assumed that the initial gcmf was a pure power law , with the same index at arbitrarily high masses as low ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is potentially less of a concern if @xmath11 started as a @xcite function with an exponential cut - off at masses @xmath296 , as we have assumed , since then the existence of a strict upper bound @xmath297 (  [ subsec : models ] ) means that the dependence of an evaporation - evolved @xmath1 on @xmath61 and @xmath4 must saturate for small enough galactocentric radii ( high enough gc densities ) .",
    "even so , the `` scale - free '' models of , in which @xmath148 and all gcs in a milky way - like galaxy potential have the same time - averaged @xmath295 , still predict a gradient in @xmath1 versus @xmath4 that is stronger than observed .    showed that , if they left all of their other assumptions unchanged , then a dependence of gcmf peak mass on @xmath4 could be effectively erased by an appropriately varying radial velocity anisotropy in the initial gc system .",
    "thus , in their `` eddington '' models the eccentricity of a typical cluster orbit increases with galactocentric distance ( the time average of @xmath295 increases with radius ) , such that globulars spread over a larger range of current @xmath4 can have more similar @xmath61 and associated @xmath1 .",
    "however , the initial velocity - anisotropy gradient required to fit the milky way gcmf data specifically is only marginally consistent with the observed kinematics of the gc system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , @xcite constructed broadly similar models for the gcmf of the virgo elliptical m87 and concluded that there , too , a variable radial velocity anisotropy is required to match the observed @xmath1 versus @xmath4 ; but the model anisotropy profile in this case is clearly inconsistent with the true velocity distribution of the gc system , which is observed to be isotropic out to large @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these results certainly suggest that some element is lacking in @xmath4-oriented gcmf models developed as outlined above .",
    "but they do not mean that the fault lies with the main hypothesis , that the difference between the mass functions of young clusters and old gcs is due to the effects of slow , relaxation - driven disruption in the latter case .",
    "any conclusions about velocity anisotropy depend on the totality of steps taken to connect the densities and positions of clusters ; and it is possible that reasonable changes to one or more of these ancillary assumptions could make the models compatible with the observed kinematics of gcs in both the milky way and m87 , without abandoning a basic physical picture of evaporation - dominated gcmf evolution that is otherwise quite successful .",
    "one issue is that previous models have always specified evaporation rates a priori as functions of cluster density ( or orbital pericenter ) , usually normalizing @xmath10 so that @xmath29840 as in standard treatments of two - body relaxation .",
    "however , following our discussion in  [ subsec : lifetime ] and  [ subsec : approx ] , it would seem worthwhile to investigate these models with @xmath10 increased at fixed @xmath0 or @xmath61 to allow @xmath299 ( if @xmath131 for the low - mass power - law part of the initial gcmf ) .    and",
    "@xcite both consider velocity distributions parametrized by a galactocentric anisotropy radius , @xmath300 , inside of which a cluster system is essentially isotropic and beyond which it is increasingly dominated by radial orbits . in these terms , the difficulty with the published models is that , to reproduce the observed insensitivity of @xmath1 to @xmath4 given standard normalizations of @xmath10 , they require values of @xmath300 that are smaller than allowed by observations ( especially for m87 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath300 to more realistic values while keeping the normalization of @xmath10 fixed leads to a stronger gradient in @xmath1 : the orbits of gcs at small @xmath301 remain closely isotropic and the typical @xmath61 and @xmath1 are essentially unchanged , while at large galactocentric distances the cluster orbits are on average less radial than before , with larger @xmath61 , lower densities , and lower evolved @xmath1 for a given @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is illustrated , for example , in figure 9 of .",
    "however , it can be compensated at least in part by increasing @xmath10 by a common factor for all gcs , with the new , larger @xmath300 fixed , _ if the initial mass function is assumed to have been a @xcite function rather than a pure power law extending to arbitrarily high masses_. a faster evaporation rate will then lead to a ( roughly ) proportionate increase in the evolved gcmf peak mass for gcs with relatively low densities , i.e. , those at large @xmath4 and @xmath61 ; but the increase in @xmath1 will be _ smaller _ , and eventually even negligible , for higher - density clusters at progressively smaller @xmath4again because @xmath1 grows less than linearly with @xmath30 when there is an upper limit @xmath302 due to an exponential cut - off in the initial @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the qualitative effect of increasing the normalization of @xmath10 in models with radially varying gc velocity anisotropy is to weaken the amount of radial - orbit bias required to fit an observed @xmath1 versus @xmath4 .",
    "another point , emphasized by , has to do with the standard starting assumption that gcs orbit in galaxies that are perfectly static and spherical . in reality , galaxies grow hierarchically . in this case , even if the values of @xmath10 are not changed , much of the burden for the weakening or erasing of any initial gradients in @xmath1 versus @xmath4 may be transferred from velocity anisotropy to the time - dependent evolution of the galaxies themselves .",
    "violent relaxation , major mergers , and smaller accretion events all work to move clusters between different parts of galaxies and between different progenitors , scrambling and combining any number of pericenter  density@xmath1 relations .",
    "any position dependences in the gc @xmath0 distribution and in @xmath1 itself for the final galaxy are therefore bound to be weaker , more scattered , and more difficult to relate accurately to a cluster velocity distribution than in the case of a monolithic , non - evolving potential . allowing for a non - spherical galaxy potential would have qualitatively the same effect , because in this case every cluster explores a range of pericenters and different maximum tidal fields on each of its orbits .",
    "in this situation , it may be important to ask how evaporation rates can still be approximately constant in time  so that cluster masses still decrease approximately linearly with @xmath41 as our models assume  if the tidal field around any given gc changes significantly over time .",
    "thus , consider first a system of gcs in a single , static galaxy potential .",
    "the mass - evolution curve for each cluster is approximately a straight line , @xmath34 , with @xmath10 depending on some measure of internal density , which may be @xmath156 , @xmath225 , or @xmath276 .",
    "the average mass - evolution curve for the entire system of clusters is also approximately linear , @xmath303 .",
    "if now a merger or other event rearranges the clusters in the galaxy , then after the event the mass - loss rates of some clusters will be higher than before and the rates of other clusters will be lower than before",
    ". however , if the mean density of the galaxy as a whole is roughly the same after the event as before , then so too will be the average of the gc densities , because of tidal limitation .",
    "the average @xmath304 ( say ) will differ even less between the pre- and post - merger systems .",
    "thus , although using instantaneous densities to estimate the past @xmath10 of individual clusters may err on the high side for some clusters and on the low side for others , these errors will average away to a small or even zero net bias",
    ". the approximation @xmath305  in time in our gcmf models will then still be valid in the mean , and the average @xmath306 dependence of sufficiently large numbers of clusters will remain roughly linear .",
    "this type of scenario might be expected to pertain at least to galaxies that evolve on the fundamental plane , since this entails a connection between the total ( baryonic plus dark ) masses and circular speeds of galaxies , of the form @xmath307 or @xmath308 . by the virial theorem ,",
    "the average densities scale as @xmath309 , and thus @xmath310 or @xmath311 .",
    "insofar as @xmath312 for the gcs , the system - wide average @xmath304 should therefore not change drastically even after a major merger between two fundamental - plane galaxies ; at most , the ratio of final to initial @xmath313 will be roughly of order the @xmath314 power of the ratio of final to initial @xmath315 . note that this line of reasoning is closely related to that applied by to explain the small observed galaxy - to - galaxy differences in the average turnover masses of entire gc systems ( although non - zero differences do exist , and can be accomodated in these sorts of arguments ; see @xcite ) .",
    "a full exploration of questions such as these , about the wide range of ingredients in current gc - plus - galaxy models , will most likely require large @xmath35-body simulations set in a realistic , cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "until these can be carried out , it is our view that the kinematics of globular cluster systems can not be used as decisive side constraints on theories for the gcmf .",
    "we have shown that the mass function @xmath11 of globular clusters in the milky way depends significantly on cluster half - mass density , @xmath0 , with the peak or turnover mass @xmath1 increasing and the width of the distribution decreasing as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this behavior is expected if the gcmf initially rose towards masses below the present turnover scale  as the mass functions of young cluster systems like that in the antennae galaxies do  and has evolved to its current shape via the slow depletion of low - mass clusters over gyr timescales , primarily through relaxation - driven evaporation .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 _ increases _ with cluster density favors evaporation over external gravitational shocks as the primary mechanism of low - mass cluster disruption , since the mass - loss rates associated with shocks depend inversely on cluster density and directly on cluster mass .",
    "our results therefore add to previous arguments supporting an interpretation of the gcmf in terms of evaporation - dominated evolution , based on the fact that @xmath11 scales as @xmath316 with @xmath28 in the low - mass limit @xcite .",
    "the observed gcmf as a function of @xmath0 is fitted well by simple models in which the initial distribution was a @xcite function , @xmath317 with @xmath29 and @xmath148 assumed , and in which clusters have been losing mass for a hubble time at roughly steady rates that can be estimated from their current half - mass densities as @xmath30 .",
    "we have shown that , although this prescription is approximate , it captures the main physical dependence of relaxation - driven evaporation .",
    "in particular , it leads to model gcmfs that are entirely consistent with those resulting from alternative characterizations of evaporation rates in terms of cluster tidal densities @xmath8 or mean surface densities @xmath9 (  [ subsec : approx ] ) .",
    "the normalization of @xmath10 at a given @xmath0 ( or @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ) required to fit the gcmf implies total cluster lifetimes that are within range of the lifetimes typically obtained in theoretical studies of two - body relaxation , although our values may be slightly shorter than the theoretical ones if the low - mass , power - law part of the initial cluster mass function was as steep as we have assumed .",
    "taking clusters in various bins of central concentration @xmath3 and galactocentric radius @xmath4 and using their ( individual ) observed densities as direct input to our models yields dynamically evolved gcmfs as functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 that agree well with all data .",
    "this again indicates that the most fundamental physical dependence in the gcmf is that on cluster density .",
    "moreover , our models for @xmath11 versus @xmath4 obtained in this way are consistent in particular with the well - known insensitivity of the gcmf peak mass to galactocentric position .",
    "this is seen to follow from a significant variation of @xmath1 with @xmath0 ( or @xmath8 , or @xmath9)due in our analysis to evaporation - dominated cluster disruption  combined with substantial scatter in the gc densities at any galactocentric position .",
    "we have not invoked an anisotropic gc velocity distribution to explain the observed weak variation of @xmath1 with @xmath4 ; indeed , we have made no predictions or assumptions whatsoever about velocity anisotropy .",
    "we have emphasized that , when velocity anisotropy enters other long - term dynamical - evolution models for the gcmf , it is only in conjunction with several additional , interrelated assumptions made as part of larger efforts to derive theoretical density@xmath4 relations for gcs  which we have not attempted to do here .",
    "the apparent need in some current models for a strong bias towards high - eccentricity cluster orbits to explain the near - constancy of @xmath1 versus @xmath4 might well be avoided by changing one or more ancillary assumptions in the models , without having to discard the underlying idea that the peak and low - mass shape of the gcmf are the result of relaxation - driven cluster disruption .",
    "it clearly will be of interest to test and refine the main ideas in this paper through modeling of the gcmfs in other galaxies .",
    "for the time being at least , doing so will require the estimation of approximate mass - loss rates using cluster half - mass densities rather than tidal quantities , simply because gc half - light radii can be measured accurately in many systems beyond the local group , whereas tidal radii are much more model - dependent and difficult to observe .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that the peak mass of the gcmf in the sombrero galaxy ( m104 ) increases with @xmath0 in a way that is reasonably well described by sums of evolved @xcite functions as in the models presented in this paper .",
