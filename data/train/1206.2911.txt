    "the movement of bacteria , cells or other microorganisms under the effect of a chemical stimulus , represented by a chemoattractant , has been widely studied in mathematics in the last two decades , see @xcite , and numerous models involving partial differential equations have been proposed .",
    "the basic unknowns in these chemotactic models are the density of individuals and the concentrations of some chemical attractants .",
    "one of the most considered models is the patlak - keller - segel system @xcite , where the evolution of the density of cells is described by a parabolic equation , and the concentration of a chemoattractant is generally given by a parabolic or elliptic equation , depending on the different regimes to be described and on authors choices .",
    "the behavior of this system is quite well known now : in the one - dimensional case , the solution is always global in time , while in two and more dimensions the solutions exist globally in time or blow up according to the size of the initial data .",
    "however , a drawback of this model is that the diffusion leads to a fast dissipation or an explosive behavior , and prevents us to observe intermediate organized structures , like aggregation patterns .",
    "by contrast , models based on hyperbolic / kinetic equations for the evolution of the density of individuals , are characterized by a finite speed of propagation and have registered a growing consideration in the last few years @xcite . in such models , the population is divided in compartments depending on the velocity of propagation of individuals , giving raise to kinetic type equations , either with continuous or discrete velocities .",
    "here we consider an hyperbolic - parabolic system which arises as a simple model for chemotaxis : @xmath0 such kind of models were originally considered in @xcite , and later reconsidered in @xcite .",
    "they are based on an adaptation to the chemotactic case of the so - called hyperbolic heat or cattaneo or telegraph equation , adding a source term accounting for the chemotactic motion in the equation for the flux .",
    "the function @xmath1 is the density of cells in the considered medium , @xmath2 is their averaged flux and @xmath3 denotes the density of chemoattractant .",
    "the individuals move at a constant speed @xmath4 , changing their direction along the axis during the time .",
    "the positive constant @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient of the chemoattractant ; the positive coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are respectively its production and degradation rates .",
    "these equations are expected to behave asymptotically as the corresponding parabolic equations , but displaying a different and richer transitory regime , and this is what is known to happen at least without the chemotactic term .",
    "analytically , these models have been studied in @xcite and more recently in @xcite , where the analytical features were almost completely worked out , at least around constant equilibrium states , where it is proved that , at least for the cauchy problem , the solutions of the hyperbolic and parabolic models are close for large times .    the novelty of this paper is to consider this one dimensional model on a network .",
    "more precisely , we consider system in the form on each arc of the network , and so we have to consider one set of solutions @xmath8 for each arc",
    ". functions on different arcs are coupled using suitable transmission conditions on each node of the network .",
    "conservation laws or wave equations on networks have already been studied , for example in @xcite for traffic flows or in @xcite for flexible strings distributed along a planar graph . however ,",
    "here we consider different types of transmission conditions , which impose the continuity of the fluxes rather than the continuity of the densities .",
    "therefore , in this article , a particular care will be given to the proper setting and the numerical approximation of the transmission conditions at nodes , both for the hyperbolic and the parabolic parts of .",
    "in particular , some conditions have to be imposed on the approximation of the boundary conditions , in order to ensure the conservation of the total mass of the system .",
    "let us also mention that a first analytical study of system on a network , coupled through transmission conditions of this type , is carried out in @xcite .",
    "the study of this system is motivated by the tissue - engineering research concerning the movement of fibroblasts on artificial scaffolds @xcite , during the process of dermal wound healing .",
    "the natural process of healing of a damaged tissue occurs through a first phase in which fibroblasts , the stem cells to be in charge of to the reparation of dermal tissue , create a new extracellular matrix , essentially made by collagen , and , driven by chemotaxis , migrate to fill the wound . in recent years",
    ", tissue - engineering research has developed some new techniques , which aim at accelerating the wound healing . actually , cellular migration on an injured body zone is stimulated and improved by using artificial scaffolds constituted by a network of crossed polymeric threads inserted within the wound , which mimic the extracellular matrix .",
    "the fibroblasts s reparation action is accelerated , since they already have a support and also they are constrained to move along the network , with less degrees of freedom , and it is believed that this approach could be effective in minimizing scarring @xcite . therefore ,",
    "our simple model of chemotaxis on a network , which can be obtained by reducing the kinetic model of cell movement on a 3d extracellular matrix proposed in @xcite to the case of a network , see @xcite , is a good candidate for reproducing this configuration : the arcs of the network stand for the fibers of the scaffold and the transport equations give the evolution of the density of fibroblasts on each fiber .",
    "however , in this paper , we only address the numerical aspects of this problem .",
    "more direct applications of this framework to the real biomedical problem will be explored in future research . as reported in @xcite ,",
    "the present understanding of the critical biochemical and biophysical parameters that affect cell motility in three - dimensional environments is quite limited .",
    "nevertheless , it has been observed that junction interactions affect local directional persistence as well as cell speed at and away from the junctions , so providing a new mechanism to control cell motility by using the extracellular microstructure .",
    "therefore , mathematical modeling and simulations could play a crucial role in providing a better understanding of these phenomena , and an optimization tool for designing improved scaffolds .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on the construction of an effective numerical scheme for computing the solutions to this problem , which is not an easy task , even for the case of a single arc . in that case ,",
    "non constant highly concentrated stationary solutions are expected and schemes which are able to capture these large gradients in an accurate way are needed .",
    "the main problem is to balance correctly the source term with the differential part , in order to avoid an incorrect approximation of the density flux at equilibrium , as first observed in @xcite . _",
    "asymptotic high order schemes _ ( aho ) were introduced in @xcite , inspired by @xcite , to deal with this kind of inaccuracies .",
    "these schemes are based on standard finite differences methods , modified by a suitable treatment of the source terms , and they take into account for the behavior of the solutions near non constant stationary states . an alternative approach , inspired by the well - balanced methods , has been proposed in @xcite , with similar results .",
    "however the methods in @xcite seem easier to be generalized to the present framework .",
    "regarding the problem considered in this paper , the main difficulty is in the discretization of the transmission conditions at node , also enforcing global mass conservation at the discrete level .",
    "therefore , in section [ sec2 ] we explain some analytical properties of problem , with a particular emphasis on boundary and transmission conditions .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the numerical approximation of the problem based on a aho scheme with a suitable discretization of the transmission and boundary conditions ensuring the mass conservation . in the present paper , we have chosen to consider only the second order version of the scheme , which is enough for our purposes , but it is easy to adapt also the third order schemes proposed in @xcite .",
    "remark that here , unlike the single interval case , we are forced , for any given time step , to fix the space step on each arc using relation introduced in section 3 , to obtain consistency on the boundary .",
    "numerical tests ( not shown ) confirm the necessity of this supplementary constraint .",
    "finally , in section [ sec4 ] , we report some numerical experiments , to show the behavior and the stability of our scheme . a special attention is given to the stability of the scheme near nodes and the correct behavior of the approximation for large times and near asymptotic states .",
    "it has to be mentioned that during this research we observed , in contrast with what happens for the diffusive models , the appearance of blow - up phenomena even for data of relative moderated size . even if , up to now , there are no rigorous results , which can help to decide if these singular events are really occurring , or they are just a numerical artifact , our close investigation in subsection 4.3 gives a strong indication towards the first alternative",
    "let us define a network or a connected graph @xmath9 , as composed of two finite sets , a set of @xmath10 nodes ( or vertices ) @xmath11 and a set of @xmath12 arcs ( or edges ) @xmath13 , such that an arc connects a pair of nodes .",
    "since arcs are bidirectional the graph is non - oriented , but we need to fix an artificial orientation in order to fix a sign to the velocities .",
    "the network is therefore composed of `` oriented '' arcs and there are two different types of intervals at a node @xmath14 : incoming ones  the set of these intervals is denoted by @xmath15  and outgoing ones  whose set is denoted by @xmath16 . for example , on the network depicted in figure [ fig:4a1n ] , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we will also denote in the following by @xmath19 and @xmath20 the set of the arcs incoming or outgoing from the outer boundaries .",
    "the @xmath12 arcs of the network are parametrized as intervals @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 , and for an incoming arc , @xmath23 is the abscissa of the node , whereas it is @xmath24 for an outgoing arc .",
    "we consider system ( [ hyper - gen ] ) on each arc and rewrite it in diagonal variables for its hyperbolic part by setting @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the riemann invariants of the system and @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath27 ) denotes the density of cells following the orientation of the arc ( resp . the density of cells going in the opposite direction ) .",
    "this transformation is inverted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and yields : @xmath30 we can also denote by @xmath31 the turning rates ( namely the probabilities of cells to change direction ) and @xmath32 represents the production and degradation of the chemoattractant .",
    "we assume that all the cells are moving along an arc with the same velocity @xmath4 ( in modulus ) , which may depend however on the characteristics of the arc . for the moment",
    ", we omitted the indexes related to the arc number since no confusion was possible . from now on , however , we need to distinguish the quantities on different arcs and we denote by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 the values of the corresponding variables on the @xmath37-th arc . on the outer boundaries , we could consider general boundary conditions:@xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we just recover the standard no - flux boundary condition @xmath41    on the outer boundaries , we also consider no - flux ( neumann ) boundary conditions for @xmath3 , which read @xmath42    the no - flux boundary conditions mean that , on the boundary , the fluxes of cells and chemoattractants are null .",
    "this condition could be generalized , for example in the case when we assume that there is a production of fibroblasts on the boundary .",
    "now , let us describe how to define the conditions at a node ; this is an important point , since the behavior of the solution will be very different according to the conditions we choose .",
    "moreover , let us recall that the coupling between the densities on the arcs are obtained through these conditions . at node @xmath14 , we have to give values to the components such that the corresponding characteristics are going out of the node .",
    "therefore , we consider the following transmission conditions at node : @xmath43 where the constant @xmath44 $ ] are the transmission coefficients : they represent the probability that a cell at a node decides to move from the @xmath45th to the @xmath46th arc of the network , also including the turnabout on the same arc .",
    "let us notice that the condition differs when the arc is an incoming or an outgoing arc .",
    "indeed , for an incoming ( resp .",
    "outgoing ) arc , the value of the function @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) at the node is obtained through the system and we need only to define @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 ) at the boundary .    these transmission conditions do not guarantee the continuity of the densities at node ; however , we are interested in having the continuity of the fluxes at the node , meaning that we can not loose nor gain any cells during the passage through a node .",
    "this is obtained using a condition mixing the transmission coefficients @xmath49 and the velocities of the arcs connected at node @xmath50 . fixing a node and denoting the velocities of the arcs by @xmath51 , in order to have the flux conservation at node @xmath50 , which is given by : @xmath52 it is enough to impose the following conditions : @xmath53    notice that , condition , can be rewritten in the @xmath54 variables as @xmath55 this condition ensures that the global mass @xmath56 of the system is conserved along the time , namely : @xmath57      it is sometimes useful to restrict our attention to the case of positive transmission coefficients of dissipative type , in the sense that they ensure energy decay of the solutions to the linear version of system ( [ hyper - gen ] ) , namely : @xmath58 on a general network , with no - flux conditions on the external nodes , and transmission conditions at the internal nodes , always assuming the flux conservation condition at nodes .    to obtain the decay in time of the energy , which is defined by @xmath59 it is sufficient to impose some equalities on the coefficients , as proved in @xcite .",
    "[ prop - dissip ] the energy associated with the solutions to system , with no - flux conditions on the external nodes , and transmission conditions at the internal nodes , assuming condition , is decreasing if the transmission coefficients @xmath49 belong to @xmath60 $ ] , and at every node @xmath14 , we have : @xmath61    actually , in @xcite , it is proved that under the assumptions of proposition [ prop - dissip ] , it is possible to define a monotone generator of semigroup , and then a contraction semigroup , in the sobolev space @xmath62 , for the linear transmission problem on a network .",
    "let us remark also that in the simplest case of a network composed by two arcs ( one incoming and one outgoing , see next figure [ fig : rete ] ) , these conditions are also necessary in order to have the dissipation property .",
    "in such a case we have that dissipativity is given iff : @xmath63 using the previous relations and conditions on the coefficients @xmath49 given by , we obtain the values for the two missing coefficients : @xmath64 so , we have only one degree of freedom .",
    "now let us consider the transmission conditions for @xmath3 in system .",
    "we complement conditions , , and with a transmission condition for @xmath3 . as previously",
    ", we do not impose the continuity of the density of chemoattractant @xmath3 , but only the continuity of the flux at node @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we use the kedem - katchalsky permeability condition @xcite , which has been first proposed in the case of flux through a membrane . for some positive coefficients",
    "@xmath65 , we impose at node @xmath66 the condition @xmath67 yields the conservation of the fluxes at node @xmath50 , that is to say @xmath68 let us also notice that we can assume that @xmath69 , which does not change condition .",
    "finally , notice that the positivity of the transmission coefficients @xmath65 , guarantees the energy dissipation for the equation for @xmath3 in , when the term in @xmath1 is absent .",
    "first we consider stationary solutions , which are known to drive the asymptotic behavior of the system .",
    "let us consider the case of stationary solutions of system , complemented with boundary conditions , , , and . in the general case",
    ", we find on each arc the following solution  : @xmath70 which leads to solve , on each arc , the scalar non - local equation : @xmath71 which has to be coupled at each node by the boundary conditions , , , and .",
    "we can prove easily that in the case of dissipative coefficients @xmath49 satisfying , and the condition @xmath72 , if all the fluxes @xmath35 are null , then the density @xmath1 is continuous at a node , namely at a node @xmath50 , the functions @xmath73 have all the same values",
    ". however , this is not the general case .        for the simplest network composed of one incoming @xmath74 and one outgoing @xmath75 arc , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rete ] , we find on each interval that @xmath76 from condition , and so we obtain the following local system for @xmath77 and @xmath78  : @xmath79 with boundary conditions and for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which reads @xmath80 and @xmath81 we have also to take into account the following condition given by transmission condition  : @xmath82    solving the corresponding system for @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a difficult task , even numerically , since an infinite number of solutions exist both for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as in the case of a single interval @xcite , and it should be necessary to make them verify the above conditions at node . in order to simplify our study , we limit ourselves to state a result in the case of constant ( in space ) stationary solutions to system .",
    "let us consider a general network @xmath9 and system set on each arc of the network , complemented with boundary and transmission conditions , , , and .",
    "\\(i ) for general values of transmission coefficients @xmath49 satisfying , there is no non trivial constant stationary solution .",
    "\\(ii ) for the special case of transmission coefficients @xmath49 satisfying the dissipation relations and and of the ratios @xmath83 being equal to the same constant on each arc , there exists a one - parameter stationary solution , which is constant by arc .",
    "take a constant ( in space ) stationary solution to system .",
    "this means that on each arc of the network , we have three constant values @xmath84 , which satisfy @xmath85 , since @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and boundary conditions , , which become in that case @xmath88 and @xmath89 we remark that conditions and are automatically satisfied .",
    "\\(i ) denoting by @xmath12 the number of arcs of the network , we have to fix therefore @xmath12 unknowns to determine the stationary solution . conditions  impose 4 equations by arc , unless the arc is connected to an outer node .",
    "in that case , there are only 2 conditions .",
    "to sum up , if we denote by @xmath90 the number of outer nodes , we need to satisfy @xmath91 conditions .",
    "taking into account relations , we obtain that equations are linked and the system can be reduced to a system of @xmath92 conditions , where @xmath93 is the number of inner nodes , which is , generally speaking , greater than the number of unknowns . therefore , unless some particular sets of coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath49 , the only solution for previous system is the null one on each arc .",
    "\\(ii ) now , let us consider transmission coefficients @xmath49 satisfying relations and .",

    ", we can find a stationary solution defined on each arc by @xmath97 .",
    "such kind of solution satisfies clearly the transmission condition , but satisfies also condition with relations .    in the case ( i ) of the previous proposition , since the total initial mass is strictly positive and is preserved in time , we can not expect the system to converge asymptotically to a stationary state which is constant on each arc and so non - constant asymptotic solutions are expected . in the case ( ii ) , the constant state can be reached , and @xmath98 is determined by the total mass of the initial data .",
    "here we introduce our numerical schemes .",
    "we first give some details about schemes for system on a single interval and the discretization of boundary conditions presented in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our main goal will be to generalize these schemes to the case of a network .",
    "in the two first subsections , we will concentrate on the discretization of the hyperbolic part , whereas the discretization of the parabolic part will be treated in subsection [ parabolic ] .",
    "let us consider a fixed single interval @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "we define a numerical grid using the following notations : @xmath100 is the space grid size , @xmath101 is the time grid size and @xmath102 for @xmath103 are the grid points . in this subsection , we denote by @xmath104 the discretization of function @xmath105 on the grid at time @xmath106 and at point @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath110 for @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is an explicitly known function depending on @xmath113 . here",
    "we describe the discretization of system with no  flux boundary conditions @xmath114 , denoting by @xmath115 and omitting the parabolic equation for @xmath3 .",
    "since we also work with neumann boundary conditions for the @xmath3 function , the function @xmath112 will satisfy the following conditions on the boundary  : @xmath116 .",
    "we therefore consider the following system @xmath117 and rewrite it in a diagonal form , using the usual change of variables , @xmath118 set @xmath119 , so that we can rewrite the system in vector form @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , to have a reliable scheme , with a correct resolution of fluxes at equilibrium , we have to deal with asymptotically high order schemes in the following form  : @xmath123 with the following choice of the matrices @xmath124 we have a second  order aho scheme on every stationary solutions , which is enough to balance the flux of the system at equilibrium .",
    "this means that the scheme is second order when evaluated on stationary solutions .",
    "monotonicity conditions are satisfied if @xmath125 and @xmath126 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "let us mention that it should be easy to consider third  order aho schemes , but for simplicity ( these schemes require a fourth  order aho scheme for the parabolic equation with a five - points discretization for @xmath127 ) , we prefer to limit our presentation to the second  order case .",
    "boundary conditions for scheme have to be treated carefully , to enforce mass - conservation . in @xcite ,",
    "the following boundary conditions were used  : @xmath128 these boundary conditions have been obtained by calculating the difference of the discrete mass at two successive computational times and defining @xmath129 and @xmath130 as a function of the discrete quantities computed at time @xmath106 in order to cancel exactly this difference .",
    "consequently , the discrete mass will be preserved in time as the continuous mass @xmath131 is conserved for system with boundary conditions @xmath114 , at the continuous level .",
    "this technique will be generalized in this paper to the case of a network .",
    "let us consider a network as previously defined in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "each arc @xmath132 , is parametrized as an interval @xmath133 $ ] and is discretized with a space step @xmath134 and discretization points @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "we still denote by @xmath101 the time step , which is the same for all the arcs of the network . in this subsection , we denote by @xmath137 the discretization on the grid at time @xmath106 and at point @xmath135 of a function @xmath138 on the @xmath37-th arc for @xmath136 and @xmath109 .",
    "now , we consider the aho scheme on each interval , and we rewrite it in the @xmath54 variables thanks to the change of variables , in order to define the discrete boundary and transmission conditions . we keep the possibility to use different aho schemes on different intervals and therefore the coefficients of the scheme will be indexed by the number of the arc .",
    "let @xmath139 be the matrix associated to the change of variables , namely such that @xmath140 .",
    "we rewrite in the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 as  : @xmath141 with coefficients @xmath142 and @xmath143 defined by @xmath144    now , we define the numerical boundary conditions associated to this scheme . as before for equation , we need four boundary or transmission conditions to implement this scheme on each interval .",
    "considering an arc and its initial and end nodes , there are two possibilities : either they are external nodes , namely nodes from the outer boundaries linked to only one arc , or they are internal nodes connecting several arcs together .",
    "the boundary and transmission conditions will therefore depend on this feature .",
    "below , we will impose two boundary conditions  at outer nodes , and two transmission conditions  at inner nodes .",
    "the first type of boundary conditions will come from condition at outer nodes  : @xmath145 where @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) means that the arc is incoming from ( resp .",
    "outgoing to ) the outer boundary .",
    "the second one will come from a discretization of the transmission condition at node @xmath50 , that is to say @xmath146 however , these relations link all the unknowns together and they can not be used alone . an effective way to compute all these quantities will be presented after equation below .",
    "we still have two missing conditions per arc , which can be recovered by imposing the exact mass conservation between two successive computational steps .",
    "the discrete total mass is given by @xmath147 , where the mass corresponding to the arc @xmath37 is defined as : @xmath148 computing @xmath149 , we find : @xmath150 we are going to impose boundary conditions such that the right - hand side in the previous difference is exactly canceled .",
    "on the outer boundaries we obtain the following type of boundary conditions , following equation  : @xmath151 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the same meaning as previously .",
    "these expressions correspond to boundary conditions in the case of a more general aho scheme @xcite .",
    "then , using the conditions ( [ bound3 ] ) to simplify the computation of @xmath149 and summing with respect to the nodes instead of the arcs , we can rewrite the remaining difference of mass in @xmath152 variables as : @xmath153 therefore , using the transmission conditions for @xmath154 if @xmath155 and for @xmath156 if @xmath157 , we can split the equation interval by interval and obtain the following numerical boundary conditions : @xmath158 @xmath159 once these quantities are computed , we can use equations at time @xmath160 , to obtain @xmath161 if @xmath162 and @xmath163 if @xmath164 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have imposed four boundary conditions , , , and on each interval .",
    "conditions and deal with the outer boundary and are written in the @xmath54 variables , whereas conditions and deal with the node and are written in the @xmath165 variables . under these conditions ,",
    "the total numerical mass is conserved at each step .",
    "now , we have to discuss the consistency of all these conditions .",
    "first , conditions , are imposed exactly . besides , it has been proved in @xcite that conditions , set on the outer boundary , are generally of order one and of order two on stationary solutions . finally , we need to consider the consistency of the conditions at node .",
    "we present here only the case @xmath164 . expanding in taylor series up to order one ,",
    "we get : @xmath166 now , to have consistency , namely to cancel the last two terms on the r.h.s .",
    ", we need to impose the following condition linking the space and the time step on each arc : @xmath167 which implies , thanks to : @xmath168 under this condition and using equations , expanding in taylor series up to order three we find : @xmath169 thanks to this development we can state our general result of consistency .",
    "[ consistency ] given a general scheme in the form , the conditions at node are consistent only if on each arc the condition is verified . to have the second order accuracy at node the following conditions on the coefficients of the scheme have to be verified : @xmath170 moreover , to have a third order accuracy for stationary solutions , we need  : @xmath171    notice that , all these conditions are satisfied for the roe scheme defined by .",
    "now , let us explain how to compute the approximations @xmath172 of the function @xmath112 on the arc @xmath37 at discretization point @xmath135 and time @xmath160 needed for computing , , and . referring to system , we have @xmath173 , where @xmath3 satisfies the parabolic equation @xmath174 on each arc .",
    "boundary conditions for @xmath3 are given by equations on the outer boundary and at a node .",
    "we solve the parabolic equation , using a finite differences scheme in space and a crank - nicolson method in time , namely an explicit - implicit method in time .",
    "therefore , we will have the following equation for @xmath175 , @xmath176 now , let us find the two boundary conditions needed on each interval . as in subsection [ ahonetwork ] , the boundary conditions will be given in the case of an outer node and in the case of an inner node .",
    "on the outer boundary , condition for @xmath3 is discretized using a second order approximation , which is @xmath177 let us now describe our numerical approximation for the transmission condition which , as the transmission condition for the hyperbolic part , couples the @xmath3 functions of arcs having a node in common .",
    "condition is discretized using the same second - order discretization formula as before , namely we have at node @xmath50 , @xmath178 these relations can be rewritten as  : @xmath179 let us remark that the previous discretizations are compatible with relations considering that for outer boundaries the coefficients @xmath65 are null .",
    "therefore , in this case , the value of @xmath180 is just equal to @xmath181 .",
    "since equations are coupling the unknowns of all arcs altogether , we have to solve a large system which contains all the equations of type and also the discretizations of transmission conditions .",
    "once the values of @xmath182 are known , we can compute a second - order discretization of the derivatives of @xmath3 which gives the values of the @xmath112 function , namely : @xmath183 the discretization of @xmath112 needed at equations , , and is therefore given by @xmath184 .",
    "here we present some numerical experiments for system ( [ hyper - gen ] ) on networks , with the use of the methods introduced in section [ sec3 ] , namely the second  order aho scheme for the hyperbolic part , complemented with the crank - nicolson scheme for the parabolic part .",
