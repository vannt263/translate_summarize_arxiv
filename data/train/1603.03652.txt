    "@xcite investigated the frequency response of plate structures in contact with a fluid under an internal harmonic force .",
    "@xcite calculated the resonant frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a rectangular plate lying at the bottom of a container filled with inviscid compressible fluid .",

    "this system is designed to re - distribute vibrations within a fluid - solid system in a predefined finite frequency range .",
    "the high - contrast multi - scale resonators can be tuned to serve the required frequency interval by varying the masses or the connecting beams .",
    "the proposed design is different from the conventional tuned mass dampers , which are effective only around the eigenfrequency of the damper .",
    "the possibility to reduce the vibrations in a finite frequency interval is crucial when the spectrum of the system depends on a random parameter , such as the level of fluid inside the container .",
    "we also point out that the masses of the resonators can be much smaller than the mass of the fluid - filled container .",

    "tanks in an industrial plant , used to store flammable gases or liquids , are generally designed as steel cylinders with small thickness .",

    "the fluid , which is assumed to have a height @xmath7 in the computations , is characterised by a bulk modulus @xmath8 , a density @xmath9 and a dynamic viscosity @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 is very large and @xmath12 is very small , the fluid can be considered as incompressible and inviscid .",

    ", while in the second formulation we approximate the fluid as an acoustic medium . in section  [ springmassapproximation ] we will discuss an alternative method , in which the fluid is modelled by spring - mass oscillators , and we will show that this method , that is widely used in the literature , can lead to an imprecise evaluation of the eigenfrequencies of the fluid - solid system .      in order to perform an eigenfrequency analysis , we need to remove the non - linear and viscous terms from the navier - stokes equations  .",

    "the first antisymmetric eigenmode is shown in fig .  [ 3dtank]b , and it corresponds to an eigenfrequency @xmath48 .",
    "we focus the attention on the antisymmetric modes of the system , since they are the only modes excited by a horizontal acceleration of the ground ( @xcite ) , as in the presence of an earthquake .",

    "the present approach represents an approximation of the method described in section  [ eigenfrequency3d-1 ] , since the velocity is not a variable of the problem so that the fluid flow is neglected .",
    "only pressure waves propagate in the fluid , as the latter is assumed to be inviscid .",
    "the first eigenfrequency associated with an antisymmetric mode , shown in fig .  [ 3dtank]c , is found to be @xmath51 , which is very close to the value determined with the linear water wave theory .",
    "the reason is that the frequencies of sloshing waves are considerably smaller than   ( see [ sloshingwavesfrequencies ] ) , therefore the contribution of the fluid velocity can be ignored . on the other hand , at low frequencies the model based on the linearised navier - stokes equations",
    "should be employed , since in this case the velocity of sloshing waves is significant .      in order to reduce the vibrations of the tank induced by earthquakes , we propose to insert a passive system of high - contrast multi - scale resonators . when the fluid - solid system is subjected to a dynamic base excitation characterised by a fourier spectrum having a peak around a frequency close to one of the eigenfrequencies of the resonators ,",
    "the latter start to vibrate , while the oscillations of the main structure are reduced . in this way ,",
    "waves are diverted away from the tank , which undergoes smaller deformations and is subjected to lower stresses and displacements .",
    "we observe that the lower modes of the resonators are more efficient , as they require more energy to vibrate .",

    "the chains are pinned at the bottom to the concrete foundation and at the top to a truss made of bars with high rigidity , which is connected to the tank .",
    "if the number of masses is large enough , each chain of resonators can be studied analytically as a periodic structure made of point masses connected by non - inertial beams .",
    "this periodic structure is characterised by a single dispersion curve , which has the following expression ( @xcite ) : @xmath57}{m d^3 \\left [ 2+\\cos{(k d ) } \\right ] } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the wavenumber .",
    "the upper limit of this dispersion curve is @xmath59 .",

    ".   allows to determine precisely the frequency interval where the resonators are effective .",
    "the upper limit @xmath60 of this frequency interval can be easily modified by changing the masses or the properties of the beams .",
    "the capability of the resonators to work in a large frequency range is very important when the natural frequencies of the system can vary during its service life , as in the present case due to the variation of the fluid level inside the tank : this is the main advantage of the proposed design .",
    "we also point out that the number of the eigenfrequencies of the resonators , around which the resonators are more efficient , can be increased by adding more masses .    for the tank examined in this section ,",

    "the elastic modulus , poisson s ratio and density of steel used for the resonators are equal to  , and  , respectively .",
    "we note that the mass of each beam is much smaller than the mass of each sphere .",
    "moreover , the total mass of the four chains of resonators is less than  4% of the total mass of the tank completely filled with petrol . the dispersion curve obtained from eq .",

    "in an industrial facility some areas are usually covered by sets of fuel storage tanks , connected to each other by the piping system or through the soil . in regions of high seismicity , it is essential to study how these sets of tanks behave when they are subjected to an earthquake and how their vibrations can be reduced in order to avoid serious accidents due to structural failure .    for simplicity",
