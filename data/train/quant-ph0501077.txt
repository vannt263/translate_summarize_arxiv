    "for more than twenty years , physicists and engineers have investigated quantum - mechanical phenomena as mechanisms to satisfy certain cryptographic objectives .",
    "such objectives include user authentication , bit commitment , key generation , and recently , data encryption .",
    "to date , the cryptographic objective most considered in the literature has been key generation . in key generation ,",
    "two users , who initially share a small amount of secret information , remotely agree on a sequence of bits that is both larger than their original shared information and is known only to them .",
    "the newly generated bits ( keys ) are then used to publicly communicate secret messages over classical channels by driving data encrypters like the information - theoretically perfect one - time pad  @xcite or more efficient ( but less secure ) encrypters , such as the advanced encryption standard , where security is described in terms of complexity assumptions  @xcite .",
    "several approaches to key generation using quantum effects have been proposed and demonstrated .",
    "the most famous of these protocols , the bb84 protocol  @xcite and the ekert protocol  @xcite have enjoyed considerable theoretical consideration as well as experimental implementation  @xcite .",
    "a major technical limitation of the bb84 ( ekert ) protocol is that the achievable key - generation rate ( more importantly , the rate - distance product ) is relatively low due to the protocol s requirement for single - photon ( entangled - photon ) quantum states .",
    "this requirement is a burden not only in the generation of such states , but also in that such states are acutely susceptible to loss , are not optically amplifiable ( in general ) , and are difficult to detect at high rates . furthermore , because the received light must be detected at the single - photon level , integration of the protocol implementations into today s wavelength - division - multiplexed ( wdm ) fiber - optic infrastructure is problematic because cross - channel isolation is typically no better than 30db .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated a new quantum cryptographic scheme , based on yuen s kcq approach  @xcite , in which the inherent quantum noise of coherent states of light is used to perform the cryptographic service of data encryption  @xcite . unlike single - photon states , coherent states ( of moderate average - energy level )",
    "are easily generated , easily detected , and are optically amplifiable , networkable , and loss tolerant .",
    "note that key generation and data encryption are two _ different _ cryptographic objectives with _ different _ sets of criteria by which to judge performance ",
    "a direct comparison between the two is not appropriate .    in our scheme ,",
    "legitimate users extend a short , shared secret - key by using a publicity known deterministic function .",
    "the transmitter uses the extended key to select a signal set for each transmitted bit such that the legitimate receiver , using the same extended key , is able to execute a simple binary - decision measurement on each bit .",
    "an eavesdropper , on the other hand , who does not possess the secret key , is subject to an irreducible quantum uncertainty in each measurement , even with the use of ideal detectors .",
    "this uncertainty results in randomization of the eavesdropper s observations , thereby realizing a true randomized cipher @xcite which effectively limits the eavesdropper s ability to decipher the transmitted message .",
    "this randomization is  free \" in that it does not require any additional action on the part of the transmitter in contrast to other randomized ciphers @xcite , where active randomization of the signal - set is required by the transmitter .",
    "our scheme , running at data - encryption rates up to 650mbps , uses off - the - shelf components and is compatible with today s optical telecommunications infrastructure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ protocol ] we outline our quantum - noise protected data - encryption protocol ( call the @xmath1 protocol ) , in section  [ sec ] we address issues of security and performance , and in section  [ exp ] we summarize our experimental results .",
    "we have implemented two versions of our quantum - noise protected data - encryption protocol using different signal sets  one using polarization states  @xcite ( polarization - mode scheme ) and the other using phase states  @xcite ( time - mode scheme ) . in both implementations ,",
    "the fundamental and irreducible measurement uncertainty of coherent states is the key element giving security . in the polarization - mode scheme , the two - mode coherent states employed are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a coherent state , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 is odd , and the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate the two orthogonal polarization mode - functions .",
    "viewed on the poincar sphere , these @xmath8 polarization states form @xmath0 bases that uniformly span a great circle as shown in fig .  [",
    "circles](top ) . in the time - mode scheme ,",
    "the single - mode coherent states employed are latexmath:[\\ ] ] the conditional probability distribution @xmath52 is completely and uniquely specified by the probability distribution of the secret key @xmath53 , the probability distribution of the plaintext message @xmath54 , and the encryption function that takes @xmath42 to @xmath55 . while @xmath56 is usually assumed known to the attacker via the _ kerckhoff assumption _ , it is important to emphasize that the calculation of @xmath57 also depends on the probability distributions @xmath53 and @xmath54 according to eve .",
    "this means that eve s conditional entropy @xmath57 may change if eve s probability distribution @xmath54 changes due to the acquisition of some side - information ( such as the language of the plaintext message ) .    for the cryptographic objective of data encryption , be it classical or quantum - noise  protected , some relevant information - theoretic quantities are : @xmath58 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43-bit transmitted message ( plaintext ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are bob s and eve s @xmath43-bit observations of the encrypted plaintext ( ciphertext ) , and @xmath18 is the @xmath10-bit secret key shared by the legitimate users . in words",
    ", these quantities describe i ) the error rate for the legitimate users , ii ) the secrecy of the data bits when under attack , and iii ) the secrecy of the secret key when under attack .    when launched on either the data bits or the secret key , cryptographic attacks are normally divided into two categories , known - plaintext ( kpt ) attacks and ciphertext - only ( cto ) attacks .",
    "cto attacks correspond to situations where @xmath54 is uniform , according to the attacker .",
    "in other words , all @xmath61 possible messages are transmitted with equal probability .",
    "a kpt attack corresponds to all situations where @xmath54 is nonuniform including the totally degenerate deterministic case of chosen - plaintext .",
    "some example kpt attacks include knowledge of the native language of the message or perhaps some statistical knowledge of the message content . while there are clearly varying degrees of kpt attacks , a cto attack refers to the specific case of uniform @xmath54 .    according to information theory  @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ quant2 ] ) and ( [ quant3 ] ) satisfy the following inequalities : @xmath62 where eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) is known as the shannon limit  @xcite which is valid when @xmath63 ( our data - encryption protocol operates in a regime where @xmath64 . in the regime in which @xmath1 operates ,",

    "note that in @xmath1 , contrary to the case for key generation [ cf.eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) ] , the condition @xmath66 need _ not _ be satisfied .",
    "in fact the opposite is normally true where an attacker ( given the secret key after measurement ) has a lower bit - error rate than the legitimate receiver .",
    "this is the case when a significant amount of loss and/or additive noise exists between the two users where it is assumed that the attacker , performing an adequate quantum measurement , is located near the transmitter .",
    "the one - time pad encrypter achieves what shannon called  perfect security \" which corresponds to @xmath67 in the inequality of eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) when @xmath68 .",
    "the practical problem with the one - time pad is that every data bit to be encrypted requires one bit of key .",

    "( [ pd1 ] ) and ( [ pd2 ] ) can be rigorously proven , for nontrivial @xmath78 , when under a kpt attack ; no significant complexity - based security has been proven either .",
    "note that the appropriate information - theoretic criteria by which to quantify the security of a data encrypter may be different for different sociological situations .",
    "for example , satisfying the criteria given in eqs .",
    "( [ pd1 ] ) and ( [ pd2 ] ) ( @xmath79 ) may yield security in some situations , but not in others .",
    "a different set of operationally - meaningful criteria for the cryptographic objective of data encryption , which does not rely on shannon entropy , has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    towards the goal of satisfying the cryptographic objective of data encryption , according to any reasonable information - theory  based criteria ,",
    "we offer a new approach to data - encryption wherein the irreducible uncertainty inherent in the quantum measurement of coherent states of light is used to perform high - speed randomized encryption that does not sacrifice the data rate . in our protocol ( section  [ protocol ] ) , the logical mappings of the symbols are interleaved ( fig .  [ circles ] ) .",
    "while the users ( who share a short secret - key ) are able to make simple binary decisions on the @xmath0-ry signal set , an attacker ( who does not share the secret key ) is left with an irreducible uncertainty in her measurements due to the quantum fluctuations inherent to coherent states of light .",
    "specifically , with @xmath0 and @xmath80 in a particular regime , measurements of neighboring states , on either the poincar sphere or the phase circle , overlap and obscure one another .",
    "to an attacker , this overlap is equivalent to alice broadcasting digital representations of the @xmath0-ry signal that are then actively randomized over the signal s closest neighbors in the signal constellation . by using coherent states with a relatively weak amplitude",
    ", a similar randomization is achieved through quantum - measurement noise which requires no active effort on the part of the transmitter , but still obscures the true identity of the state called for by the protocol .",
    "such randomization is realized through _ any _ quantum measurement including direct detection , balanced homodyne / heterodyne detection , and optimal quantum - phase detection .",
    "given some restrictive assumptions , one can even describe the performance of a quantum - mechanically optimal attack  the best attack allowed by quantum mechanics . while the physical structure of such an optimal attack may be unknown , quantum mechanics can establish bounds on the maximum information rate of an attacker . for individual attacks on the message where classical correlations are ignored , the quantum - mechanically optimal attack  known as the optimal positive operator - valued measure  corresponds to optimally distinguishing all of the states mapped to logical one from those mapped to logical zero .",
    "figure  [ povm_fig ] plots the information rate of the optimal positive operator - valued measure as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath0 for the time- and polarization - mode implementations where information  @xcite is defined as @xmath81 for a bit - error rate @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ povm_fig ] also plots the information rate of the described attack when performing an ideal heterodyne measurement .",
    "the performance of this measurement is included because it represents the  highest performing \" receiver structure that an attacker could practically implement using today s technology .",
    "the difference between the information rates of the time- and polarization - mode implementations , for both the optimal positive operator - valued measure and ideal heterodyne attacks , is due to the fact that logical bits are defined differentially across two modes in the time - mode scheme ",
    "a bit is correctly determined if and only if two consecutive state measurements are both correct or both incorrect .",
    "it is important to remember that both the optimal positive operator - valued measure and ideal heterodyne analyses are for a very limited attack where eve does not use her information on the correlations between the running - keys to determine the plaintext or secret key ",
    "a real attacker would presumably use all information at her disposal .    while the inability to distinguish neighboring states plays a role in protecting the secret key against attacks ,",
    "additional mechanisms are required to improve the secrecy of the secret key . by introducing deliberate state - randomization at the transmitter , perfect security against cto attacks on the secret key [ @xmath83 , uniform @xmath54 ]",
    "can be assured as well as strongly - ideal security against cto attacks on the message [ @xmath85 , uniform @xmath54 ] .",
    "more information on deliberate state - randomization is available in ref .",
    "note that the mapper and deliberate state - randomization have not yet been implemented in our published experimental realizations .",
    "physical  trojan horse \" attacks can also be launched on the message and the secret key by attempting to _ probe _",
    "alice s transmitter settings . in such an attack",
    ", an eavesdropper would send strong light into alice s transmitter and measure the state of her reflected light .",
    "attacks of this type can be passively thwarted by using an optical isolator at the output of alice s transmitter .",
    "confusion over the cryptographic service that our protocol ( @xmath1 ) offers as well as how quantum noise is exploited in our scheme prompted a criticism  @xcite to ref .",
    "@xcite and some of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have replied  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that the @xmath1 data - encryption protocol , operating in a regime where @xmath86 , already permits key generation .",

    "the following two subsections summarize the physical setups as well as the experimental results for both implementations .",

    "figure  [ eyes_time ] shows the eye patterns for encrypted 650mbps @xmath109-bit - prbs and 1mb - bitmap - file transmissions ( insets ) as measured by bob ( top ) and eve ( bottom ) . in these experiments ,",
    "bob is located at the end of the 200km - long line and eve is located at the transmitter ( alice ) .",
    "eve s actions are physically simulated by using bob s hardware , but starting with an incorrect secret - key . while fig .",
    "[ eyes_time](bottom ) does not explicitly demonstrate eve s inability to distinguish neighboring coherent states on the phase circle , it does , however , show that a simple bit decision is impossible .",
    "the q - factor for bob s eye pattern , as measured on the csa , was 12.3 .        in all of the time - mode implementation experiments ,",
    "the coherent states are transmitted using non - return - to - zero ( nrz ) format .",
    "the return - to - zero - like appearance of bob s eye pattern is due to non - zero rise time of the optical phase modulation .",
    "this phenomena is also observed in traditional nrz - dpsk systems .",
    "the apparent banding of eve s measurements at the top and bottom of the eye pattern is due to the sinusoidal transfer function of the temporally asymmetric interferometer used for demodulation . despite this apparent banding",

    "if an eavesdropper were to , say , perform optical heterodyne detection , a uniform distribution of phases would be observed .    in the current setup ,",

    "although we simulate an eavesdropper by placing bob s equipment at the transmitter , a real eavesdropper would aim to make the best measurements allowed by quantum mechanics ( just as in the polarization - mode implementation ) . the numerical calculation used to plot fig .",
    "[ povm_fig](left ) shows that for @xmath97dbm signal power at 650mbps ( @xmath110 photons / bit ) with @xmath99 , eve s maximum obtainable information in an individual attack on the message would be less than @xmath111 bits / bit .",
    "in summary , we have developed schemes towards the cryptographic objective of practical data encryption by using the fundamental and irreducible quantum - measurement uncertainty of coherent states . unlike currently deployed deterministic encrypters whose security relies solely on unproven computational complexity , we offer a new quantum - mechanical vehicle to quantifiable information - theoretic security through high - speed randomized encryption .",
    "furthermore , we have clearly specified a set of security criteria for the cryptographic service of data encryption ( which are different from those for key generation ) and considered some optimal quantum attacks on our scheme . while we have yet to explicitly determine the level of information - theoretic security provided by our scheme under a general attack ( which may correspond to finding @xmath112 ) , our scheme does provide a physical layer of quantum - noise randomization that can only enhance the security of a message already encrypted with a traditional deterministic cipher .",
    "experimentally , we have implemented and demonstrated two high - speed versions of the @xmath1 data - encryption protocol using both polarization and time modes , and evaluated the schemes performances through active wdm lines . whereas the polarization - mode experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of the data - encryption protocol , the polarization independent time - mode experiments have demonstrated a technology that is  drop - in \" compatible with the existing optical telecommunications infrastructure .",
