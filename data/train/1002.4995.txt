    "in this paper we proceed with the study of the random interlacements introduced by a.s .",
    "sznitman in @xcite .",
    "this model is for instance related to the trace left by a random walk on the discrete torus @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and on the discrete cylinder @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) when the walk runs for times of order @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "intuitively , random interlacements describe the microscopic ` texture in the bulk ' left by the random walk in these contexts , see @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this model is the main ingredient to improve the upper bound on the disconnection time of a large discrete cylinder , and in @xcite they are used to extend the the lower bound obtained in @xcite to the case @xmath5 .    loosely speaking ,",
    "the interlacement at level @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath8 ) is given by the trace left by a poisson cloud of doubly infinite random walk trajectories in @xmath9 , where @xmath1 controls the density of the cloud .",
    "the so - called vacant set at level @xmath1 ( denoted with @xmath10 ) is the complement of the interlacement , or in other words , the set of sites in @xmath9 which are not visited by any trajectory in this cloud .",
    "the random sets @xmath8 are constructed simultaneously for all values of @xmath1 on the same probability space @xmath11 .",
    "although we postpone the precise description of the process to section  [ sec : review ] , we state here a characterization of the law @xmath12 of the indicator function of @xmath10 , regarded as a random element of @xmath13 .",
    "namely , @xmath12 is the only probability measure on @xmath13 such that @xmath14 = \\exp \\{-u \\ , \\text{cap}(k)\\ } , \\text { for all finite sets } k \\subset \\mathbb{z}^d,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the capacity of @xmath16 ( see ( [ eq : cap ] ) ) and @xmath17 stand for the canonical coordinates on @xmath13 , see remark 2.2 2 ) of @xcite .",
    "percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements presents a phase transition in the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , it is known that there is a @xmath18 , such that when @xmath19 , @xmath10 contains @xmath20-a.s .",
    "an infinite connected component , see @xcite theorem  3.4 , and when @xmath21 , @xmath10 almost surely consists of finite clusters , see @xcite theorem  3.5 .",
    "moreover it is known that if an infinite connected component of the vacant set exists , it is almost surely unique , see @xcite theorem  1.1 .    in this article",
    "we further investigate this model in the regime of small intensity @xmath1 , and give a partial answer to the question posed in @xcite , remark 3.5 2 ) . denoting by @xmath22 the closed ball with respect to the @xmath23 norm on @xmath9 with radius @xmath24 and centered at the origin , our main theorem  [ th : main ] states that @xmath25 \\geqslant 1- c_1 e^{-c_2 n^\\alpha } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] when @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are positive constants solely depending on @xmath30 and @xmath31 , see theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "we will now underline the importance of this main result by stating some of its consequences , see also section  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "as a first application of ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) , one can show the ubiquity of @xmath32 , the unique infinite component in @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath27 , with the same notation as in ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) , we show in theorem  [ th : cinftydense ] that @xmath35 \\geqslant 1 - c_3 \\exp(-c_4 n^\\alpha ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are positive constants solely depending on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath38 stands for the connected component of @xmath10 containing the origin , with ( [ eq : statecinftydense ] ) , we are able to control the diameter and the volume of @xmath38 , when this cluster is finite .",
    "this answers in part a question of @xcite , remark 4.4 3 ) . indeed in theorems",

    "the estimate ( [ eq : volestimate ] ) has the flavor of the open problem posed in @xcite , remark  4.7  1 ) .    as another application of ( [ eq : maintheorem ] )",
    "we prove in theorem  [ th : logcomp ] that for @xmath0 , @xmath27 and any @xmath42 and integer @xmath43 , @xmath44 = 0 . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    let us mention that in the case of bernoulli independent site percolation , similar results are already known to hold under weaker hypotheses .",
    "however , the techniques used in the bernoulli context are not directly applicable to random interlacements , see remark  [ rem : bernoulli ] 1 ) and 2 ) .",
    "some difficulties we mention here are the high dependence featured by the measure @xmath12 , see @xcite ( 1.68 ) , and the fact that for every @xmath45 the interlacement at level @xmath1 is almost surely an infinite connected subset of @xmath9 , see corollary  2.3 of @xcite .",
    "this property motivates the precise formulation of ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) .",
    "as we further explain in remark  [ rem : bernoulli ] 3 ) , one can hope to find a vacant path joining the boundary of two large connected sets in @xmath46 , but not necessarily a vacant path joining the sets themselves .",
    "we now describe the strategy adopted to prove ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) .",
    "in essence , the proof is based on the following two basic ingredients :    * if the interlacement separates two macroscopic components of a box , then in many sub - boxes it also separates some macroscopic components . in other words , the property of separating macroscopic components ` cascades to finer scales ' , * a fixed number of random walk paths can hardly separate macroscopic components in a large box .",
    "these claims are made precise and proved in sections  [ sec : coarse ] and [ sec : local ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : proof ] we prove ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) using these results .",
    "consider the following sequence of scales @xmath47 where @xmath48 are integers .",
    "we now provide a short overview of the proof of and give an idea of the role plaid by the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to bound the probability of the so - called separation event ( in essence the complement of the event appearing in ) . in the above mentioned ingredient @xmath51 of the proof ,",
    "we show that separation ` cascades down to finer scales ' .",
    "this allows us to bound the probability of the separation event in a box at scale @xmath52 ( having diameter @xmath53 ) by the probability that such separation occurs simultaneously in @xmath54 well - spaced boxes at the bottom scale ( each with diameter @xmath50 ) .",
    "the bound on the latter probability has to be good enough to offset the number of possible choices for the boxes at the bottom scale .",
    "the combinatorial complexity of this choice roughly amounts to choosing a binary sub - tree of depth @xmath55 in a rooted tree having @xmath56 descendants at each generation .",
    "we thus need to control the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of separation events in each of the @xmath54 boxes at the bottom scale @xmath50 . for any such",
    "given collection of boxes , we first bound the mutual dependence of the separation events in each of them .",
    "for this purpose , we keep track of the number of excursions that the random walk trajectories ( composing the random interlacements ) perform between these boxes .",
    "we now choose a large enough @xmath49 , consequently increasing the mutual distance between the boxes in this collection .",
    "in this fashion we are able to make the large deviation cost of observing too many excursions offset the combinatorial complexity of the choices of the @xmath54 boxes .",
    "this step is delicate because increasing @xmath49 also increases this combinatorial complexity . for this competition to work in our favor , we need to impose the boxes at the bottom scale to receive an average number of excursions ( say @xmath57 ) such that @xmath58 .",
    "we take @xmath59 since this will do the job , see also remark  [ rem : g100 ] 1 ) .",
    "the dependence control described in this paragraph works for every @xmath50 , once @xmath1 is chosen small enough depending on @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the previous step enables us to treat the separation event in the @xmath54 boxes as roughly independent .",
    "we thus choose @xmath50 large enough so that the probability of these essentially independent @xmath54 separation events in boxes at scale @xmath50 also offsets the combinatorial choice of the boxes . now the above ingredient @xmath60 of the proof comes into play .",
    "when @xmath50 is chosen large enough ( depending on @xmath49 ) , a fixed number ( as we said , @xmath61 will do the job ) of independent random walk excursions can hardly separate components in a given box of size @xmath50 .",
    "now that @xmath50 is fixed , we can choose @xmath62 small to make sure that observing an average of @xmath61 random walks per box in the collection above is indeed a large deviation as we described .",
    "we now give a more precise description of the proof .",
    "for each depth @xmath52 , we partition @xmath9 into boxes of diameter @xmath53 and label the boxes in this partition with a set of indices @xmath63 . for a given box ( say indexed by @xmath64 ) , we consider the random variable @xmath65 , which loosely speaking indicates the separation of two macroscopic connected sets of this box by @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to ( [ eq : chi ] ) for the precise definition .    as a reduction step",
    ", we prove that it is enough to establish ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) in the case where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is taken along the sequence @xmath53 , @xmath68 .",
    "in other words , according to proposition  [ prop : reduct ] , in order to prove ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) we only need to obtain a bound ( decaying exponentially in @xmath54 ) on the probability that @xmath69 when @xmath64 .",
    "we also rely on the concept of a skeleton , which captures the possible ways in which the separation event can propagate to finer scales . roughly speaking",
    "a skeleton is a set @xmath70 of indices in the finest scale ( @xmath71 ) satisfying some conditions on the distance between the boxes indexed by @xmath70 , see definition  [ def : skeleton ] .",
    "the notion of skeleton resembles the wiener criterion , see for instance @xcite , theorem  2.2.5 p.55 .",
    "the main purpose of this definition appears in ( [ eq : boundexcursion ] ) , where we derive a bound on the probability that a random walk , starting in one of the boxes of a skeleton , hits another box of the skeleton before escaping to infinity .",
    "the ingredient @xmath51 of the proof , which we call ` coarse graining ' argument , is the content of theorem  [ th : coarse2 ] , section  [ sec : coarse ] . loosely speaking ,",
    "this theorem states that @xmath72 hence , the problem is reduced to estimating the probability that the ` separation event ' ( @xmath73 ) occurs simultaneously for the @xmath54 indices @xmath74 in a given skeleton @xmath70 as above .",
    "this bound has to be able to offset the combinatorial complexity factor @xmath75 .",
    "let us now indicate how the above bound is related to the second ingredient , which we call ` local estimates ' .",
    "for this , fix a skeleton @xmath71 and a collection of @xmath54 boxes associated to indices @xmath76 in @xmath70 .",
    "loosely speaking , we use a large deviation estimate to bound the total number of excursions performed between different boxes of this collection by all the interlacement trajectories , see ( [ eq : boundfirst ] )",
    ". then we condition each of these excursions on their return and departure points from different neighborhoods of each box .",
    "this procedure will reduce our problem to the analysis of what happens in the surroundings of one fixed box of diameter @xmath50 .",
    "the ingredient @xmath60 of the proof is obtained in section  [ sec : local ] .",
    "it can be summarized as follows : @xmath77 moreover , this estimate is uniform on the points in which we condition these random walks to enter and exit a large neighborhood of the box .",
    "this is the content of theorem  [ th : local ] , section  [ sec : local ] and is the last piece to establish ( [ eq : maintheorem ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ th : local ] is the only part of the proof of our main result in which we need the hypothesis @xmath0 .    finally , let us outline of the proof of ( [ eq : statelocal ] ) .",
    "first we introduce the definition of a cut - point for a double infinite trajectory , see ( [ eq : cuttime ] ) . loosely speaking ,",
    "we regard each random walk excursion as a finite set of ` sausages ' connected by cut - points . given two connected subsets @xmath78 and @xmath79 of a box , we show that : @xmath80 see corollary  [ lem : chifillx ] . roughly speaking , we construct this path by `` traveling along the boundaries of the sausages '' .",
    "finally we show that with high probability ( as @xmath50 grows ) the diameters of the ` sausages ' are small when compared with @xmath50 and the excursions performed in the box @xmath81 are mutually far apart , so that they can be treated separately , see lemma  [ lem : farapart ] .",
    "this article is organized as follows .    in section  [ sec : review ] we give a precise description of the random interlacements and state some results which are used throughout the article .    in section  [ sec : applications ] , our main theorem  [ th : main ] is stated .",
    "in addition , we derive several applications of theorem",

    "we prove the main theorem  [ th : main ] assuming theorems  [ th : coarse2 ] and [ th : local ] and lemma  [ lem : indicespath ] , which are proved in the subsequent sections .",
    "the main result of section  [ sec : coarse ] is theorem  [ th : coarse2 ] , which implements the ` coarse graining ' argument ( [ eq : coarse ] ) used to reduce the problem to a microscopic scale .    in section  [ sec : local ] we describe the local picture of the process ( see ( [ eq : statelocal ] ) ) .",
