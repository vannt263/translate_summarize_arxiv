    "superdiffusive processes are ubiquitous in many natural systems , ranging from physical to biological and man - made ones .",
    "they refer to those anomalous diffusive processes where the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the diffusive particle scales nonlinearly with time .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for the background and applications of anomalous diffusion .",
    "the superdiffusive processes have been modelled in many different ways ( see @xcite for a review and analysis ) .",
    "the most used models , however , are based on random walks with lvy flights ( rwlf ) @xcite and on the use of the fractional diffusion equation ( fde ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  11 ) .",
    "there are different types of definitions of fractional derivative , such as the caputo fractional operator and the riemann  liouville fractional operator @xcite , which then have different interpretations and adapt differently to the different physical phenomena studied with them ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , anomalous diffusion of ultracold atoms has been observed in a discrete one - dimensional system @xcite . the model considered in that work for explaining",
    "the superdiffusive process is a simple diffusion model in which the particles are located in real space , each having a velocity which fluctuates in time due to interaction with a bath .",
    "then , after some time the particles position is distributed in a non - gaussian way and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) scales as a power - law of the time with a signature characteristic of superdiffusion . the mathematical framework used to describe this anomalous diffusion",
    "was based on the fde . however , an alternative view of this process is possible .",
    "first , we can consider that the diffusive particle is diffusing in a one - dimensional discrete space .",
    "then , we can consider that the diffusive particle is not only hopping to its nearest neighbours in the 1d lattice , but to any other point of it with a probability that scales with the distance between the two places .",
    "in the current work we prove analytically that such kind of processes can give rise to superdiffusion under certain conditions .",
    "we should remark that existence of such long - range hops in diffusive process has been well documented since the 1990s on experimental basis of different nature .",
    "first , the group of g.  ehrlich @xcite observed experimentally significant contributions to the thermodynamical properties of the self - diffusion of weakly bounded pd atoms from jumps spanning second and third nearest - neighbours in the metallic surface .",
    "since then , the role of long jumps in adatom and admolecules diffusing on metallic surfaces has been confirmed in many different systems @xcite .",
    "the study of diffusion on graphs is a well - established physico - mathematical theory based on the graph - theoretic version of the diffusion equation @xcite @xmath4    u(0 ) & = u_{0},\\label{eq : diff_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5  the discrete laplacian  is defined via the adjacency matrix @xmath6 of the graph and the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees @xmath7 as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the laplacian matrix has been extended to infinite , connected and locally finite graphs and studied as an operator in the hilbert space @xmath9 over the vertices @xcite .",
    "although rwlf and the fde have been applied to study diffusion on graphs ( see for instance @xcite ) , the question that arises here is whether is it possible to design a simple graph - theoretic , physically sound and mathematically elegant method based on a generalization of the laplacian operator in to account for the superdiffusive process observed in physical phenomena .",
    "an appropriate scenario for this generalization is to consider that the diffusive particle can hop not only to its nearest neighbours  as controlled by @xmath5 in  but to any other node of the graph , with a probability that decays with the increase of the shortest path distance separating the node in which the particle is currently located to the one to which it will hop .",
    "a generalization of the laplacian matrix  known as the @xmath0-path laplacian  that takes into account such long - range hops of the diffusive particle has been recently considered for finite undirected graphs @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we extend the @xmath0-path laplacians @xmath1 @xcite to consider connected and locally finite infinite graphs . we prove here that these operators are self - adjoint .",
    "we also study the transformed @xmath0-path laplacian operators using laplace , factorial and mellin transforms .",
    "we then study an infinite linear chain and obtain analytical expressions for the transformed @xmath0-path laplacians operators as well as for the exponential operators of both , the @xmath0-path laplacians and their transformations .",
    "second , we plug this generalized laplacian operators into the graph - theoretic diffusion equation ( [ eq : diff_1][eq : diff_2 ] ) to obtain a generalized diffusion equation for graphs .",
    "we prove that when the laplace- and factorial - transformed operators are used in the generalized diffusion equation , the diffusive processes observed are always normal independently of the parameters of the transforms .",
    "for the mellin - transformed @xmath0-path laplacians @xmath2 we find that the diffusion is normal only when @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath3 , however , the time evolution is superdiffusive with the superdiffusive exponent being @xmath11 , which leads to arbitrary values for @xmath12 in @xmath13 .",
    "we remind that in general we can find that @xmath14 , where the diffusion is _ normal _ when @xmath15 , while it is a superdiffusive process when @xmath16 .",
    "the particular case when @xmath17 is known as _ ballistic _ diffusion , which is characterized by the fact that at small times the particles are not hindered yet by collisions and diffuse very fast . in a follow - up paper ( part ii ) we shall study the two - dimensional situation .",
    "in this work we always consider @xmath18 to be an undirected finite or infinite graph with vertices @xmath19 and edges @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is connected and locally finite ( i.e.  each vertex has only finitely many edges emanating from it ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be the distance metric on @xmath21 , i.e.  @xmath23 is the length of the shortest path from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 be the @xmath0-path degree of the vertex @xmath24 , i.e.@xmath27 since @xmath21 is locally finite , @xmath26 is finite for every @xmath28 .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the set of all complex - valued functions on @xmath19 and by @xmath30 the set of complex - valued functions on @xmath19 with finite support .",
    "moreover , let @xmath31 be the hilbert space of square - summable functions on @xmath19 with inner product @xmath32 in @xmath31 there is a standard orthonormal basis consisting of the vectors @xmath33 , @xmath28 , where @xmath34      0 & \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    let @xmath35 be the following mapping from @xmath29 into itself : @xmath36 this means that by replacing @xmath5 in by @xmath37 in we obtain a diffusive process in which the diffusive particle hops to nodes which are separated by @xmath0 edges from its current location .",
    "this represents a natural extension of the idea of diffusion on graphs where the particle can only hops to nearest neighbours from its current position .",
    "as it has been analysed in @xcite , the so - called @xmath0-path laplacian naturally extends the concept of graph connectivity , i.e.  whether a graph is connected or not , to the @xmath0-connectivity , which indicates whether every node in the graph can be reached by a particle which is @xmath0-hopping from node to node in the graph .    on the vectors",

    "<S> this generalized diffusion equation gives rise to both normal and superdiffusive processes on infinite one - dimensional graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization is based on the @xmath0-path laplacian operators @xmath1 , which account for the hop of a diffusive particle to non - nearest neighbours in a graph . </S>",
    "<S> we first prove that the @xmath0-path laplacian operators are self - adjoint . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study the transformed @xmath0-path laplacian operators using laplace , factorial and mellin transforms . we prove that the generalized diffusion equation using the laplace- and factorial - transformed operators always produce normal diffusive processes independently of the parameters of the transforms . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the generalized diffusion equation using the mellin - transformed @xmath0-path laplacians @xmath2 produces superdiffusive processes when @xmath3 . </S>",
