    "the discipline of uncertainty quantification ( uq ) seeks to develop and apply rigorous methodologies to determine uncertainties associated the modeling and simulation of physical processes .",
    "the goal is to estimate the probabilistic variations and associated confidence intervals in the quantity of interest resulting from all relevant sources of uncertainty ( uncertainty analysis ) and to rank the contribution of individual sources of uncertainties ( sensitivity analysis ) .",
    "advances in mathematical / statistical techniques and the availability of high performance computers in recent years have provided an unprecedented opportunity to undertake the computationally intensive task of `` model predictions with confidence '' in complex multi - physics applications .",
    "broadly speaking , uq approaches can be categorized as either non - intrusive or intrusive .",
    "non - intrusive methods such as monte - carlo ( mc ) generate a statistical description of the model output by first drawing random samples from a given probability distribution , running deterministic simulations with those samples , and finally computing the output statistics and/or sensitivities .",
    "the main advantages of these methods is the simplicity of implementation using deterministic simulation codes and the embarrassingly parallel computing possibilities .",
    "however , these methods suffer from slow convergence rate .",
    "many alternative random sampling designs such as quasi - monte carlo [ ] , latin hypercube [ ] and importance sampling [ ] have been proposed .",
    "intrusive methods , on the other hand , generally require a re - formulation of deterministic models .",
    "a popular class of intrusive methods is the stochastic galerkin method based on generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) expansion [ , , ] .",
    "gpc has been used successfully in many applications such as solid mechanics [ ] , transport in heterogeneous media [ ] , fluid mechanics [ , ] , combustion [ ] , etc .",
    "the advantage of intrusive gpc - based methods is that they may have excellent convergence properties when compared to mc - based methods [ , ] .",
    "however , the rapidly increasing complexity and fidelity of multi - physics models have limited the popularity of intrusive methods .",
    "a major reason is that implementation of such methods requires extensive modifications to existing deterministic codes , a task that may be too cumbersome and time - consuming , especially for complex and nonlinearly coupled multi - physics models .",
    "the size of the coupled system arising from spatio - temporal discretizations may become so large that the implementation of any further stochastic projection schemes , such as galerkin ( sgs ) , become computationally intractable . moreover , additional challenges in implementing intrusive methods yet remain unresolved for complex unsteady applications , such as turbulent flow and highly nonlinear transient problems . for a detailed review of intrusive gpc - based uncertainty propagation for cfd applications , we refer to [ , ] .    to overcome some of these limitations , non - intrusive gpc methods have been proposed as viable alternatives ( c.f .",
    "these methods use either regression or quadrature techniques to estimate the coefficients of the gpc expansions and can typically exhibit improved convergence behavior [ ] over mc - based methods . in regression - based techniques ,",
    "oversampling is often required to compute accurate solutions , while in quadrature - based gpc methods , mc - based random sampling is replaced with evaluations corresponding to numerical integration rules ( often with very strict constraints ) .",
    "these limitations can render these methods unattractive in practice .",
    "moreover , both intrusive and non - intrusive gpc methods suffer from the so - called curse - of - dimensionality , where the computational effort required grows exponentially with the number of independent sources of uncertainty .",
    "recent developments ( stochastic collocation [ , ] , low - rank approximations [ ] , radial basis functions [ ] , pade - legendre approaches [ ] , and response surface reconstruction [ ] ) have demonstrated how the mathematical structure of a model and the regularity of the solutions can be exploited to achieve superlinear convergence [ ] .",
    "various `` hybrid '' approaches that combine intrusive and non - intrusive methods have also been recently proposed .",
    "examples include the multi - state procedure [ ] , the mixed aleatory / epistemic representation approach [ ] and the domain hybridization method [ ] , the development of which was driven by the need to couple two different descriptions of turbulent flows .    in this article , we propose an alternative hybrid ( or partially intrusive ) framework for uncertainty propagation in modular multi - physics simulations .",
    "such a framework was initially proposed for linear multi - physics problems in a previous article [ ] , and we aim to tackle general nonlinear applications in this work . as motivated in [ ] , the proposed hybrid framework can blend uq methods , intrusive or non - intrusive that are best suited or available for each individual solver module , and seamlessly `` glue '' them together to facilitate global uncertainty / sensitivity propagation . to formalize the notion of a modular solution framework , we consider an algebraic system of equations that represents an @xmath0component multi - physics system as follows .",
    "@xmath1 where , @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to the solution field and input parameters in the @xmath4-th component respectively .",
    "a differential system of equations can be reduced to the algebraic form in eq . by appropriate discretization schemes in space and time . by implementing an iterative ( staggered ) solution approach [ ] , existing ( legacy ) solvers for each module",
    "@xmath4 can be leveraged as independent computational kernels to solve eq . .",
    "at iteration @xmath5 and module @xmath6 , we have @xmath7    the iterations shown in eq .",
    "are performed until each the norm of each solution update @xmath8 falls below a prescribed tolerance .",
    "the solution from the previous iteration step @xmath9 may enter into the @xmath4-th module as an initial guess and therefore , has been included as an argument in the module operator @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , compared to a monolithic approach ( fully - coupled solvers ) solving eq .",
    ", the partitioned solution approach only requires the construction of an additional iteration controller which allows individual single - physics modules to be updated and replaced independently . from practical considerations , this approach enables an attractive `` plug - and - play '' framework for developing multi - physics simulation software . due to modeling and measurement errors , exact values of the input parameters in eq .",
    "are usually not precisely known and therefore , we model these quantities as random variables ( with a prescribed statistical description ) . the goal is to compute uncertainties in the quantities of interest in the form of probability distributions , statistics , and sensitivity information .",
    "all these tasks can be efficiently achieved within the proposed hybrid framework using gpc methods .",
    "the remainder of this article is devoted to the description of the proposed module - based hybrid uq framework . in @xmath11 ,",
    "we provide a brief overview of gpc based intrusive methods , non - intrusive methods , and semi - intrusive methods that exploit additional derivative information . in @xmath11",
    ", we detail the module - based hybrid computational framework associated with modular gpc representations . in @xmath11",
    ", we demonstrate an implementation our proposed framework thermally driven cavity flows as the numerical multi - physics example .",
    "propagating uncertainty and sensitivity information using gpc is a popular choice in cases where the solution is expected to behave regularly in the input stochastic space .",
    "we begin this review section by introducing some definitions that will be used throughout the article .",
    "let random inputs @xmath12 belong to a complete probability space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the sample space ( set of outcomes ) , @xmath15 denotes the borel measure and @xmath16 $ ] is a probability measure .",
    "we assume that the constituent random scalar components @xmath17 are independent and belong to a probability space @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath21 denote the dimension of @xmath14 .",
    "if all the moments of @xmath22 are finite , then a corresponding set of orthonormal polynomials [ ] can be defined as follows .",

    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 with @xmath26 . the chebyshev algorithm [ ]",
    "can be used to obtain the coefficients of the recurrence relation ( 4 ) from the raw moments of @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath22 is a well known probability measure , the coefficients can be analytically obtained from the weiner - askey tables [ ] .",
    "once the univariate polynomials are constructed , their multivariate extensions can be naturally constructed by tensorization .",
    "we define the component basis polynomials as follows .",
    "@xmath27    using the component basis polynomials , we define the global basis polynomials as follows .",
    "@xmath28    assuming that the solution fields in eq .",
    "are second order random variables , we can define them in terms of an infinite series of the respective orthonormal polynomials as follows .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30    defining a total order @xmath31 , we can truncate the infinite series in eq . as follows .",
    "@xmath32    as stated by the cameron - martin theorem [ ] , if the solution fields are sufficiently regular functions of the random variables , then the truncated approximation @xmath33 converges exponentially to @xmath34 , in the @xmath35sense , as @xmath36 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion in equation ( 6 ) are known as the global gpc coefficients .",
    "the gpc approximations can also be defined using a single - index and matrix - vector product form as follows .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] denotes the gpc - based coefficient matrix , @xmath39^\\mathbf{t}$ ] denotes the basis vector and @xmath40 is the cardinality of the basis .",
    "the gpc coefficients have a simple relationship to the first two moments of the solutions , which can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath41    moreover , since polynomials are orders of magnitude cheaper to compute in comparison to solving the multi - physics system in eq . , higher order statistics of the solution fields can be subsequently estimated with exhaustive mc sampling .",
    "similarly , probability distributions of related quantities of interest can be accurately estimated using the kernel density ( kde ) method [ ] .",
    "furthermore , global sensitivity indices using the anova [ ] method can also be directly obtained from the gpc coefficients .",
    "we will now describe how to propagate the gpc coefficients using non - intrusive , semi - intrusive methods and intrusive gpc - based methods . for notational simplicity",

    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "if the level of the quadrature rule is @xmath60 , the pseudospectral approximation in eq . is equivalent to a weighted regression method using the sample matrix @xmath61 .",
    "lemma in appendix proves this equivalence .",
    "semi - intrusive gpc methods are based on extracting additional stochastic information from the model with minimal modifications to the deterministic solver .",
    "a popular choice is to extract the first derivatives ( gradients ) of the solution with respect to the input parameters .",

    "as in case 1 , @xmath221 and @xmath118 were varied for a comparison of performance . the average mean - square error ( computed using @xmath222 samples ) and the wall - times observed in both implementations are listed in table . in comparison to case 1",
    ", we observe a slight reduction of costs in both implementations and slight increase in the approximation errors .",
    "moreover , since module 1 dominates the computational costs , the gains observed in the module - based hybrid implementation were only slightly lower than the gains observed in case 1 .",
    "once , again , for each instance of @xmath223 , @xmath224 , we observed the highest computational gain at @xmath217 , with higher gains expected as @xmath118 is further increased . for @xmath225",
    ", we observed a speedup factor of @xmath226 , while for @xmath227 , we observed a speedup factor of @xmath228 .",
    "we presented an extension of the module - based hybrid uq framework introduced in our previous work [ 1 ] to general nonlinear multi - physics systems .",
    "we described the basic components of the framework , namely the restriction and prolongation maps , which facilitates uncertainty propagation to be abstracted down to the module level , and a seamless blending of disparate stochastic modules for efficient global uncertainty propagation .",
    "therefore , our proposed framework reduces the developmental costs and overheads associated with stochastic multi - physics modeling and simulation , when compared to a fully - coupled monolithic framework .    besides achieving this motivating goal",
    ", we observed a speedup factor between @xmath229 and @xmath230 in numerical experiments , where high order gpc - based propagation methods developed in our proposed framework were compared against their respective monolithic implementations . due to the nonlinear structure of the model in the numerical example ,",
    "the gains observed were mainly limited to intrusive modules , where the size of the associated sgs systems were much smaller in the module - based implementation , when compared to the monolithic implementation , for the same global stochastic dimension and gpc order .",
    "although global multi - variate polynomials were chosen for uncertainty representation in this work , our proposed methodology can also be demonstrated with multiresolution uncertainty propagation schemes which employ either haar wavelets [ ] to overcome the loss of accuracy in models exhibiting discontinuities , or multi - element gpc [ ] to overcome the loss of accuracy with long - time integration in unsteady models .",
    "our experience with this framework has increased our confidence in its viability and superior scalability of modularization over monolithic implementation for uncertainty propagation in complex multi - physics systems .",
    "the framework is therefore , a suitable candidate for codesign in the next generation ( exascale ) of high performance computers .",
    "efficient strategies for parallelization in the domain of inter - module communication / data transfer , memory manipulation are currently being investigated . moreover , exploring the interplay between uncertainties and numerical errors at the modular level is also being actively investigated [ ] .",
