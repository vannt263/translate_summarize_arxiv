    "most of the fascinating aspects and applications of quantum theory ( qt ) come from the fact that quantum probabilities can not be explained by classical probability theory @xcite .",
    "this impossibility is made evident by the violation of bell @xcite and noncontextuality ( nc ) @xcite inequalities and is fundamental for the advantages of quantum computation @xcite and quantum secure communication @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a recent result @xcite reveals the basic components of genuinely quantum probabilities .    before presenting this result",
    "we need to recall some concepts .",
    "an event is a transformation produced by a measurement that changes the quantum state assigned to the system prior to the measurement into a new one .",
    "for example , consider a bell inequality experiment on pairs of particles initially prepared in a certain quantum state .",
    "two observers , alice and bob , perform independent measurements on their respective particles . in this scenario , an event can be characterized as follows : `` given the initial quantum state @xmath0 , alice measures observable @xmath1 and obtains outcome @xmath2 and bob measures @xmath3 and obtains outcome @xmath2 . '' we may denote this event by @xmath4 .",
    "two events are exclusive when they can not happen simultaneously . for example , the events @xmath4 and @xmath5 are exclusive because @xmath6 and @xmath7 can not happen simultaneously .",
    "the exclusivity graph of a set of events is the graph in which events are represented by vertices and exclusive events by connecting edges .",
    "for example , the exclusivity graph of the events @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a pentagon .",
    "an induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with any edges whose endpoints are both in this subset .",
    "the complement of a graph @xmath11 is the graph with the same vertex set as @xmath11 and such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in @xmath11 .    a result in refs .",
    "@xcite establishes that the only experiments that can not be described by classical probability theory are those whose exclusivity graphs have , as induced subgraphs , odd cycles @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ( i.e. , pentagons , heptagons , nonagons , etc . ) , or their complements @xmath14 . in light of this result , it is important to investigate , both theoretically and experimentally , the sets of quantum probabilities represented by odd cycles and their complements . key questions within this research program are the following : ( i ) what are the maximum values allowed by qt for the sum of the probabilities of events whose exclusivity graphs are odd cycles or their complements ?",
    "( ii ) in what experiments do these maxima occur ?",

    "in addition , it has been proven recently that none of the quantum maxima for odd cycles or their complements can be achieved in bell inequality scenarios @xcite .",
    "this result , also reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , underlines the importance to experimentally test the quantum predictions for the scenarios in which these maxima are achieved .",

    "the aim of this paper is to present the results of four experiments : two of them independently test the maximum quantum value for @xmath15 using two different photonic degrees of freedom and the other two independently test the maximum quantum value for @xmath16 .",

    "[ sec2 ] and the experimental results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . using two different degrees of freedom allows us to check the validity of the quantum predictions independently of the system .",

    "[ sec4 ] we present a summary .",

    "the quantum maximum for @xmath17 occurs in the klyachko - can - biniciolu - shumovsky ( kcbs ) scenario @xcite , which has been tested in several experiments @xcite . for odd cycles on seven or more vertices , the quantum maxima can be realized in the violation of nc inequalities extending the kcbs inequality . the inequality for @xmath15 [ see fig .",

    "@xcite .",
    "interestingly , this maximum can not be achieved neither with quantum systems of smaller dimension @xcite nor within bell inequality scenarios @xcite .",
    "the precise value of the quantum maximum of @xmath37 in bell inequality scenarios is not yet known .",
    "no physical principle has yet been able to explain the quantum maxima for @xmath25 and @xmath37 . however , the exclusivity principle @xcite singles out the quantum maxima of the following nc inequality : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the or graph product .",
    "the reason for the name @xmath45 is that its exclusivity graph is @xmath46 .",

    "interestingly , the quantum maximum for @xmath45 can be achieved by combining in a single experiment one test targeting the quantum maximum for @xmath25 on one physical system and another test targeting the quantum maxima for @xmath37 on an independent system .",

    ", compatibility is enforced by performing each measurement on a spatially separated system , as in bell inequality experiments . however , as pointed out in the introduction , @xmath59 and @xmath60 can not be observed in type  1 experiments . in type  2 experiments , sharp measurements are performed sequentially on the same system @xcite . type  2 is the best option when type  1 is impossible . as shown below ,",
    "targeting @xmath60 would require sequences of three sharp measurements on , at least , a five dimensional quantum system .",
    "unfortunately , no existing experimental platform is yet mature enough for such an experiment .",
    "this is the reason why we adopted the type  3 approach as in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in type  3 experiments",
    ", measurements are not sequentially performed , but each context ( i.e. , set of compatible measurements ) is implemented at once by means of a @xmath61-outcome measurement .",
    "the assumption is that each rank - one measurement corresponds to one outcome of the @xmath61-outcome measurement .",
    "however , this implies that each context requires a different @xmath61-outcome measurement , thus each rank - one measurement is implemented differently depending on the context .",
    "this is acceptable under the assumption that all implementations represent the same rank-1 measurement at the level of hidden variables .      for testing both @xmath62 and @xmath37",
    "we employ two different setups .",
    "the first setup exploits the linear transverse momentum ( ltm ) of single photons .",
    "a @xmath61-dimensional quantum state is created by defining @xmath61 path alternatives for the photon transmission through a diffractive aperture @xcite . here",
    "@xmath63 for @xmath62 and @xmath64 for @xmath37 .",
    "to prepare state @xmath65 we use a set of @xmath61 parallel slits dynamically generated using a sequence of spatial light modulators ( slms ) .",
    "if the transverse coherence length of the beam is larger than the distance separating the slits , then the state of the transmitted photon is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 represents the state of the photon transmitted by the _ _ l__th slit @xcite . here",
    "@xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) is the transmissivity ( phase ) defined for each slit and @xmath71 the normalization constant .",
    "the slits are @xmath72",
    "@xmath73 m wide and have a separation between them of @xmath74  @xmath73 m .",
    "the advantage of using slms to define slits is that they allow us to control @xmath69 and @xmath70 independently and dynamically for each slit .",
    "the ltm experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "it has two stages : preparation and measurement .",
    "the preparation stage consists of an attenuated single - photon source ( sps ) and of two slms used to encode @xmath61-dimensional quantum states .",
    "slm  1 controls the real part of the coefficients of the prepared states , while slm  2 controls their phases @xcite .",
    "the measurement stage uses the same technique and employs two other slms ( slm  3 and slm  4 ) to randomly project state @xmath65 onto one of states @xmath75 .",
    "a field - programmable gate array electronics unit controls the entire experimental setup . for example , the probability @xmath76 is obtained as the ratio between the photon counts when state @xmath77 is projected over state @xmath78 and the total number of counts when state @xmath77 is projected over the three - dimensional basis containing @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the second setup exploits the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of single photons .",
    "this degree of freedom , related to the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field , provides a wide alphabet for qudits @xcite .",
    "orbital angular momentum eigenstates are indeed spatial modes with azimuthal phase factor @xmath80 , exhibiting a helical wavefront with @xmath81 intertwined helices of handedness given by the sign of @xmath81",
    ". such a degree of freedom can provide qudits of arbitrary dimension encoded in single - photon states and has been so far exploited in several fields ranging from quantum information @xcite to microscopy @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , metrology @xcite , and optical tweezing @xcite .",
    "the oam experimental setup for testing @xmath25 and @xmath37 using oam states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "the logical basis is chosen as @xmath82 for @xmath62 and @xmath83 for @xmath37 , where @xmath68 identifies the state of a photon with oam @xmath84 .",
    "photonic oam states are manipulated with slms by means of holograms generated by computers that allow us to introduce an arbitrary phase retardation pattern in the beam .",
    "the preparation and measurement of arbitrary superposition oam states requires us to tailor both phase and amplitude profiles of the beam .",
    "this double manipulation can also be achieved by acting only on the phase of the beam by inducing selective losses @xcite . here",
    "we exploit a recently developed holographic method specifically optimized to obtain high state fidelities @xcite .",
    "measurements are chosen so as to maximize the number of oam eigenstates in the set in order to increase the overall diffraction efficiency of the holograms .",
    "the setup in fig .  [ fig1](d ) has two stages . in the preparation stage , an sps generates heralded single photons by spontaneous parametric down conversion in a beta - barium - borate crystal .",
    "single photons are then projected on the fundamental tem@xmath85 mode by means of a single mode fiber ( smf ) . a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs )",
    "selects the horizontally polarized photons , which are then prepared in the state @xmath77 by using an slm ( slm  1 ) . in the measurement stage ,",
    "projective measurements are performed by means of a second slm ( slm  2 ) , whose hologram is chosen in order to convert state @xmath86 into tem@xmath85 , which is the only one that can be coupled to an smf . as a result , the combination of slm  2 , an smf , and a single - photon detector , an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , allows us to perform the desired projection .",
    "for example , @xmath87 is obtained as the ratio between the photon counts when state @xmath65 is projected over state @xmath75 and the total number of counts when state @xmath65 is projected over a five - dimensional basis containing @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "an imaging system , not shown in fig .  [ fig1](d ) , was implemented between the screens of the two slms in order to avoid the gouy phase - shift effect .",

    "therefore , a more detailed analysis of the experimental results is needed before reaching any conclusion .",

    "all results are in good agreement with the maxima for @xmath25 , @xmath37 , and @xmath45 predicted by qt and , therefore , with the maximum for @xmath45 allowed by the exclusivity principle .",
    "we have tested the maximum quantum values of two types of quantum correlations that have been identified as basic components of the quantum correlations that can not be explained classically .",

    "our results have also confirmed that this value is experimentally reachable .",
