    "in conclusion , we have conducted a detailed study on the growth , electronic and magnetic properties of the @xmath0-fe@xmath1n atomic layers on cu(001 ) .",
    "the ordered trilayer film of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n can be prepared by the fe deposition under n@xmath2 atmosphere onto the existing monolayer surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the repetition of the growth cycles including the high - energy n@xmath3 ion implantation resulted in the imperfect bilayer @xmath0-fe@xmath1n .",
    "the stm and sts observations revealed the change in the surface topography and electronic structures with increasing the sample thickness .",
    "the xas and xmcd measurements also showed the thickness dependence of the spectra , and the corresponding evolution of the @xmath51 values .",
    "all the thickness dependence of the electronic and magnetic properties is well explained by the layer - resolved dos calculated using the first principles .",
    "structural perfection of the system makes it possible to fully comprehend the layer - by - layer electronic / magnetic states of the @xmath0-fe@xmath1n atomic layers .",

    "the escape probability of electrons from inside a sample to a vacuum depends on the depth at which the electrons are excited . for a numerical interpretation of the xas edge jump ,",
    "the following factors should be mainly considered in principle : the penetration length of an incident x - ray ( @xmath70 ) and electron escape depth ( @xmath71 ) , both energy - dependent . in the case of a few atomic layers of 3@xmath5 transition metals ,",
    "the attenuation of the incident x - ray intensity is almost negligible because @xmath70 is orders of magnitude longer than the sample thickness @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present case , only the electron escape probability at the depth @xmath72 from the surface , namely , a factor of @xmath73 is taken into account . as for the @xmath71 value of fe , 17   was tentatively assumed in our analysis , which is experimentally determined for fe thin films @xcite .",
    "then , based on the experimental fe ( n ) edge jump values of 0.12 ( 0.015 ) , those for the full - coverage dot - like bilayer , trilayer , and quadlayer @xmath0-fe@xmath1n on cu(001 ) are calculated as summarized in table [ tablejump ] .",
