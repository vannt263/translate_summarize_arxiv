    "the expression @xmath92 for the off - diagonal element of the evolution matrix applies in the limit of weak rotation , @xmath93 . the spread in the local values of @xmath28 originates from the randomness of @xmath94 as well as from the randomness of the waiting times , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the calculation of the distribution function of @xmath28 involves averaging over three random variables @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the poisson distribution . introducing dimensionless variables , @xmath97 and integrating over @xmath98 with the help of the @xmath79-function yields @xmath99 for @xmath100",

    "the result , eq .",
    "( [ k2-result ] ) , can be established from the simple reasoning : the product @xmath127 contains the terms of the type @xmath128 and the terms @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",

    "we can now restate the above observation as follows : @xmath126 weakly depends on @xmath131 for @xmath159 , and decays exponentially with @xmath131 for @xmath160 .",
    "since the transport of electron between the electrodes takes the time @xmath161 , we conclude that the realization of the hyperfine field does not change during this time interval .",
    "finally , to estimate the magnitude of @xmath126 for @xmath162 , we calculate the quantity @xmath163 and average it over hyperfine fields .",
    "this averaging can be performed analytically .",

    "this conclusion however implies that the magnitudes of @xmath28 are the same on each site . in reality the magnitudes of @xmath28 are distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ steepest ] ) .",

    "we begin with the recurrence relation for @xmath170 @xmath171 the explicit form of @xmath172 can be found exactly for arbitrary distribution @xmath173 . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a new variable @xmath174 and rewrite eq .",

    "this readily yields @xmath177^n.\\ ] ] for large @xmath38 the form of @xmath178 and , correspondingly , the form of the distribution @xmath179 approaches to the gaussian .",
    "thus the distribution @xmath180 is essentially log - normal @xmath181,\\ ] ] where @xmath182 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ tilde ] ) that the center of the distribution , @xmath183 , moves linearly with @xmath38 , which is the same as the average of the quantum distribution , while the width slowly grows with @xmath38 as @xmath184 .",
    "strong local _",
    "quantum _ fluctuations of tmr persist up to @xmath185 .",
    "for such @xmath38 the width of the classical distribution remains smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "note also , that probabilistic treatment of the spin rotation encoded in eq .",
    "( [ recurrence - classical ] ) forbids the negative tmr , i.e. restricts the domain of @xmath183 to negative @xmath8 .",
    "if we , however , proceed from the classical limit of eq .",
    "( [ f - recursion ] ) to the fokker - planck equation , then the classical limit of the fokker - planck equation would correspond to neglecting @xmath186 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ f - p ] ) . note that by doing so , we also remove the restriction that @xmath8 is negative .",
    "the fokker - planck equation in this limit reduces to a heat equation , and , similarly to the quantum result , yields a flat distribution at large @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to `` temperature equilibration '' at long times .",
    "even though the classical and quantum fokker - plank results share limiting behavior and have the same average at all times , their shapes are visibly distinct .    in this subsection",
    "we have demonstrated that there are two different classical limits of the quantum spin evolution .",
