    "the magnification bias of number counts of background galaxies is used to determine cluster mass distribution ( broadhurst et al . , 1995 ; taylor et al . ,",
    "1998 ) , the redshift distribution of sources and to bring constraints on cosmological parameters ( fort et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "all these methods show that it is important to study the width and the shape of the depletion area .",
    "+ we have simulated the depletion effect with four different lens models : the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , the isothermal sphere with a core ( sic ) , the power - law profile ( plp ) and an elliptical potential ( ep ) introduced by schneider et al .",
    "we also use two analytical redshift distributions for background objects .",
    "the first one contains two identical populations located at @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the second one is the one used by taylor et al .",
    "we adopt @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "1 shows the results .",
    "the increase of the velocity dispersion @xmath6 leads to an increase of the minimum position of the curve ( increase of the einstein radius ) and of the half width at half minimum of the depletion area which can be explained by the sensitivity of the depletion to the mass in the outer parts of the cluster which is bigger when @xmath6 increases .",
    "the intensity of the depletion is not affected by @xmath6 .",
    "+ the introduction of a core radius @xmath7 in the model leads to the appearance of a hole near the cluster s center followed by a bump which decreases as @xmath7 increases .",
    "+ the increase of the slope @xmath8 of the mass profile does not affect the minimum position of the depletion area but leads to an increase of the minimum value and a decrease of the half width at half minimum of the curve ( same reason as for the sis : when @xmath8 increases , the mass is concentrated in the inner part of the cluster and the depletion effect is less extended to the outer regions ) .",
    "+ the variation of the ellipticity @xmath9 of the potential gives rise to a stretching with regard to the minimum position and the minimum value of the curve .",
    "we have simulated the various influences of model parameters on the typical features of the depletion curves .",
    "as these ones are poorly known , their influence on the depletion area must be explored in more details before application to real data .",
    "the effects of the filters , redshift distribution of the background sources and color selection on the depletion area have also been studied and an application of these results to hst data is in progress ( mayen c. & soucail g. , in preparation ) .",
