    "in a finite volume , this statement is strictly true only if free boundary conditions are taken .",
    "if one considers periodic boundary conditions , one must also specify the value of @xmath30 along two non - trivial lattice paths that wind around the lattice ( they are sometimes called polyakov loops ) . for instance , one must also fix @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some fixed value of @xmath33 . if we require the absence of magnetic circulation along these non - trivial paths , we must have @xmath34 for any @xmath33 . on a finite lattice of size @xmath24",
    ", this condition can be satisfied only if @xmath35 is an integer , a condition that will be always satisfied in the numerical simulations that we shall present .",
    "the critical behaviour of uniformly frustrated @xmath0 models changes dramatically with @xmath22 . for @xmath36",

    "it shows a kosterlitz - thouless transition at @xmath2 [ on a square lattice  @xcite @xmath37 , where the correlation length @xmath38 diverges as @xmath39 for @xmath40 ; the low - temperature phase , @xmath41 , is characterized by quasi long - range order  correlation functions decay algebraically  associated with a line of fixed points . in the case of maximal frustration ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath42 , the system undergoes two very close continuous transitions ( their critical temperature is @xmath43 on the square lattice ) , respectively in the ising and kosterlitz - thouless universality classes , see , e.g. , hpv-05,korshunov-06 and references therein .",
    "the critical behaviour for other values of @xmath22 is even more complex , see , e.g. , cd-85,kvb-95,ft-95,hw-95,ll-95,smk-97,cs-85,pckjc-00 , and ling - etal-96 for experiments .",
    "there may be several transitions , whose nature is not clear in most of the cases .",
    "even the structure of the ground state is only partially understood @xcite . for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an integer number ,",
    "if @xmath46 is the critical temperature where the paramagnetic phase ends , @xmath46 decreases with increasing @xmath45 ; for example , @xcite @xmath47 for @xmath48 and  @xcite @xmath49 for @xmath50 and 56 , respectively .",
    "these studies suggest that @xmath46 vanishes  @xcite as @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "the critical behaviour for irrational values of @xmath22 is even less clear , see , e.g. , cs-85,pckjc-00 . in this case",
    ", there are some indications that the system is paramagnetic for any @xmath53 and that a glassy transition occurs at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned works studied the critical behaviour as a function of the temperature @xmath53 , while keeping the uniform frustration @xmath22 fixed . in this paper",
    "we investigate a different critical limit , i.e. we consider the limit @xmath54 at fixed @xmath53 in the region @xmath55 . in other words ,",
    "we investigate the effect of a small uniform frustration on the low - temperature @xmath0 critical behaviour .",
    "we show that a uniform frustration is a relevant perturbation at the fixed points that occur in the @xmath0 model for @xmath56 .",
    "as soon as @xmath22 is non - vanishing , the correlation length becomes finite and the system is paramagnetic .    the critical behaviour for small values of @xmath22 can be understood within the coulomb - gas picture @xcite .",
    "if one considers the villain hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ xymodb ] ) , one can write the partition function as @xmath57 where @xcite @xmath58 is the spin - wave contribution and @xmath59 is the coulomb - gas hamiltonian : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an integer ( vorticity ) defined at the site @xmath62 of the dual lattice and @xmath63 is the lattice coulomb potential . in ( [ villain ] )",
    "the sum over @xmath64 is restricted to configurations satisfying the neutrality condition  @xcite @xmath65 . for @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath67 this representation allows one to show that correlations functions decay algebraically .",
    "the two - point correlation function is the product of a spin - wave contribution , which decays algebraically , and of a vortex contribution . for @xmath67",
    "charged vortices are strictly bound to form dipoles and",
    "the corresponding correlation function also decays algebraically @xcite .",
    "for @xmath68 the picture changes . for small @xmath22 , in the temperature interval @xmath69 , there are unbounded particles with @xmath70 and charge @xmath71 , which screen the coulomb interaction among the vortices of charge @xmath72 , @xmath73",
    ". the debye screening length can be easily computed .",
    "consider a vortex of charge 1 , surrounded by particles of charge @xmath71 . since there is one charge @xmath71 for each lattice site",
    ", complete screening is achieved when these charges occupy a circle of area @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the screening length @xmath38 should be proportional to @xmath76 . in this picture , for @xmath54 , the system is equivalent to a dilute gas ( the density is proportional to @xmath77 ) of neutral particles interacting by means of a screened coulomb potential @xmath78 .",
    "we can thus perform a standard virial expansion to predict that the vortex - vortex correlation function is proportional to @xmath78 , hence decays exponentially with a rate controlled by the debye screening length .",
    "this argument indicates that , for sufficiently small @xmath22 and any @xmath41 , the system is paramagnetic with a correlation length that scales as @xmath79 for @xmath54 .",
    "equation ( [ xif ] ) can also be predicted by simple dimensional arguments . for a given value of @xmath22 and @xmath53 ,",
    "consider a real - space renormalisation - group ( rg ) transformation .",
    "eliminate lattice sites obtaining a lattice with a link length that is twice that of the original lattice . in lattice units we have @xmath80 , where we use a prime for quantities that refer to the decimated lattice .",
    "analogously , we obtain @xmath81 for the frustration parameter .",
    "it follows @xmath82 .",
    "this quantity is therefore constant under rg transformations , i.e. @xmath83 . under the rg transformation , the hamiltonian parameters also change .",
    "in particular , the transformation induces a temperature change @xmath84 .",
    "however , for small @xmath22 , one is close to the @xmath0 line of fixed points and thus we expect @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath86 holds at ( approximately ) fixed temperature and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , it implies ( [ xif ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we wish to verify numerically ( [ xif ] ) and study the critical behaviour of gauge - invariant susceptibilities ( they will be defined in the next section ) .",
    "note that , in a sense , at fixed @xmath55 , the magnetic flux @xmath22 plays the role of the reduced temperature , with an associated correlation - length exponent @xmath87 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we define gauge - invariant correlation functions , the associated susceptibilities and correlation lengths , and discuss the expected critical behaviour . in sec .  [ sec3 ] we present some monte carlo ( mc ) results that fully confirm the theoretical predictions .",

    "we assume this family to be translationally invariant : the path @xmath105 is obtained by rigidly translating the path @xmath106 that connects the origin to @xmath107 . in this case",
    ", the correlation function @xmath103 is uniquely defined by specifying the paths from the origin to any point @xmath108 .    because of the presence of the gauge field , the hamiltonian is not translationally invariant , nor is it symmetric under the symmetry transformations of the lattice .",
    "nonetheless , there are generalized symmetries of the hamiltonian that also involve gauge transformations .",
    "for instance , if @xmath109 is an integer , the hamiltonian is invariant under the generalized translations @xmath110 gauge - invariant correlation functions are invariant under these transformations .",
    "this implies that they do not depend on @xmath108 and @xmath111 separately , but only on the difference @xmath112 .",
    "this invariance can be understood intuitively if one notes that gauge - invariant quantities should only depend on the value of the flux through a plaquette , i.e. , @xmath16 , and of the polyakov correlations @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in our model",
    "@xmath16 is independent of @xmath20 and , if @xmath109 is an integer , @xmath113 and @xmath114 do not depend on @xmath33 : hence , translation invariance holds .",

    "we wish now to obtain a similar result for the susceptibilities . in order to predict their scaling behaviour ,",
    "let us note that , for @xmath66 and @xmath55 , @xmath131 decays algebraically , i.e. , @xmath132 .",

    ".    the check of the previous prediction for @xmath121 does not present conceptual difficulties . instead",
    ", when considering @xmath122 , one shoud keep in mind that this quantity depends on a path family .",

    "of course , on the lattice it is impossible to ensure ( [ scal - rel - gamma ] ) exactly .",
    "however , note that the relevant scale is fixed by the correlation length and thus , violations at the level of the lattice spacing are irrelevant in the critical limit .    in the following",
    "we shall consider the path families @xmath166 , which are specified by a non - negative integer @xmath45 .",

    "these families of paths behave simply under the transformation ( [ scal - rel - gamma ] ) . if we consider the path @xmath167 for @xmath173 , the mapping ( [ scal - rel - gamma ] ) implies that , for @xmath174 , one should consider the path @xmath175 between the origin and the point @xmath176 .",
