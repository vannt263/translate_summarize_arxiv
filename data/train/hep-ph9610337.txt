    "will be observable in the @xmath5 production mode .",
    "however , we do find that the parameter regions for which higgs boson observability is not possible at lep2 or the lhc represent a small percentage of the total possible parameter space .",
    "many detection modes are involved in establishing the lhc no - lose theorem for the mssm .",

    "thus , to be conservative , we excluded from our considerations any choice of nmssm parameters for which the modes a)-d ) might be relevant . even over this restricted region of parameter space , we shall demonstrate that nmssm parameter choices can be found such that there are no observable higgs signatures at either lep2 or the lhc .",
    "in order to specify a point in nmssm parameter space , we have adopted the following procedure .    *",

    ", we could scan @xmath59 .",
    "however , we impose three additional restrictions on @xmath60 as follows . in order to avoid the presence of the model - dependent",
    ", possibly dominant @xmath61 decays , we restrict the scan to @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , this implies that no @xmath60 scan is possible if @xmath63 .",
    "we also impose the restrictions : @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 decays are forbidden ; and @xmath66 , which implies that the model - dependent decays @xmath67 are absent .",
    "we emphasize that there may be parameter choices , for which no higgs bosons of the nmssm are observable , that lie outside the restricted portion of parameter space that we search .",
    "our goal here is not to fully delineate all problematical parameter choices , but rather to demonstrate the existence of parameters for which it is guaranteed that no nmssm higgs boson can be found without increased lep2 energy and/or luminosity , or increased lhc luminosity or lhc detector improvements .",

    "we note that when @xmath79 is kinematically allowed , the @xmath80 decays are forbidden for the @xmath81 values we consider here .",
    "thus , the @xmath82 decays are exactly as in the mssm and the mssm results can be employed ` as is ' when the @xmath70 contour is specified as a function of @xmath83 and @xmath25 .",

    "statistical significances in the nmssm model are obtained for the @xmath91 and @xmath4 by multiplying these standard statistical significances by the appropriate @xmath92 enhancement factor or by @xmath93 and by the computed @xmath94 branching ratio of the higgs boson in question .",
    "recall that we do not search parameter regions for which the @xmath94 branching ratios would be uncertain due to higgs pair decay channels being kinematically allowed .",
    "* finally , we assume that mode 7 ) is only relevant for the @xmath4 ( as in the mssm ) .",

    "thus , we use an optimistic limit for this mode s @xmath2 region of viability ; @xmath98 is assumed to be achieved in this mode for @xmath99 if @xmath100 .",

    "the lhc @xmath73 and @xmath74 modes allow detection if lep2 does not . for high @xmath104",
    ", the parameter regions where points of unobservability are found are also of very limited extent , disappearing as the @xmath105 and/or @xmath85 lhc modes allow detection where lep2 does not .",
    "however , significant portions of searched parameter space contain points of unobservability for moderate @xmath25 values . that such @xmath25 values should be the most ` dangerous ' can be anticipated from the mssm results .",
    "it is well - known ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that there is a wedge of mssm parameter space at moderate @xmath25 and with @xmath106 and @xmath107 masses above about @xmath108 for which the only observable mssm higgs boson is the light sm - like @xmath109 , and that it can only be seen in the @xmath73 mode at the lhc ( @xmath110 at lep2 ) . by choosing @xmath81 and @xmath60 in the nmssm so that @xmath111 and @xmath112 are close to or above the @xmath113 of lep2 , then , by analogy , at moderate @xmath25 we would need to rely on the @xmath114 modes",
    ". however , in the nmssm , parameter choices are possible for which all the @xmath115 couplings are reduced relative to sm strength .",
    "this reduction will suppress the @xmath73 couplings coming from the @xmath116-boson loop .",

    "the regions of unobservability comprise only a very small portion of those found for @xmath119 .",
    "this reduction is due to the increased @xmath117 couplings of the @xmath91 and @xmath4 , which imply increased @xmath125 production cross sections .",

    "the moderate @xmath187 value makes it possible to have the required @xmath185 coupling enhancement without it being so large as to make the @xmath188 mode observable in @xmath185 production .",

    "the manner in which this point escapes discovery is now apparent .",
    "first , the minimum values required for the @xmath92 values for @xmath91 observability in the @xmath94 mode are : 53 ( @xmath204 ) ; 32 ( @xmath205 ) ; 35 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "the actual values all lie below those required .",

    "regarding the other discovery modes , @xmath163 and @xmath145 are both in the mass range for which the @xmath73 mode is potentially viable and the @xmath139 is potentially detectable in the @xmath140 channel .",
    "however , the suppressed @xmath208 couplings imply smallish @xmath209 production rates for @xmath68 .",
    "relative to a sm higgs of the same mass we have : @xmath210 ( note that these strengths are not simply the @xmath211 magnitudes due to enhanced @xmath212-quark loop contributions which interfere with the @xmath213-quark loop contributions at amplitude level . )",
    "further , the enhanced higgs decay rate to @xmath214 and the reduced @xmath116-loop contributions to the @xmath73 coupling suppress the @xmath73 branching ratios of @xmath163 and @xmath145 relative to sm expectations .",
    "we find : @xmath215  suppression sufficient to make @xmath163 and @xmath145 invisible in the @xmath73 mode . the suppressed @xmath137 coupling and the enhanced @xmath216 decays are sufficient to suppress @xmath217 much below sm expectations : @xmath218  such that the @xmath74 signal has a significance of only @xmath219 , even though a sm higgs of this mass would yield a @xmath220 signal . in short ,",
    "there is enough flexibility due to the addition of the singlet higgs field ( which has no couplings to sm fermions and vector bosons ! ) for _ all _ the higgs bosons to escape detection for certain choices of model parameters , provided @xmath25 is moderate in size .",
    "moderate @xmath25 implies that @xmath186 decays for light higgs are suppressed , while at the same time @xmath84 production is not adequately enhanced for detection of the @xmath221 mode .",
    "the regions of nmssm parameter space where no higgs boson can be detected will expand if full @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) luminosity is not available at the lhc ( lep2 ) or efficiencies are smaller than anticipated .",
    "conversely , these `` regions of unobservability '' could decrease substantially ( perhaps disappear ) with improved efficiency (  due to the expanded calorimeter option discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the @xmath222 final state or higher luminosity . these issues will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "we have explicitly neglected supersymmetric ( susy ) decay modes of the higgs bosons in our treatment . if these decays are important , the regions of unobservability found without using the susy final states will increase in size .",
    "however , higgs masses in the regions of unobservability are typically modest in size ( @xmath223 ) , and as susy mass limits increase with lep2 running this additional concern will become less relevant . of course , if susy decays are significant , detection of the higgs bosons in the susy modes might be possible , in which case the regions of unobservability might decrease in size .",
    "assessment of this issue is dependent upon a specific model for soft susy breaking and will not be pursued here .    finally ,",
    "although we can not establish a no - lose theorem for the nmssm higgs bosons at lep2 and the lhc ( in contrast to the no - lose theorems applicable to the nlc higgs search with @xmath224 ) , the regions of complete higgs boson unobservability appear to constitute a small fraction of the total model parameter space .",
