    "have been extensively studied in the research community over the past few decades .",
    "the analysis of clouds and their features is important for a wide variety of applications .",
    "for example , it has been used for nowcasting to deliver accurate weather forecasts @xcite , rainfall and satellite precipitation estimates  @xcite , in the study of contrails  @xcite , and various other day - to - day meteorological applications  @xcite .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "have been investigating the clouds vertical structure @xcite and cloud attenuation for optimizing satellite links @xcite .",
    "sky / cloud imaging can be performed in different ways .",
    "satellite imagery @xcite and aerial photographs  @xcite are popular in particular for large - scale surveys ; airborne light detection and ranging ( lidar ) data are extensively used for aerial surveys  @xcite . however",
    ", these techniques rarely provide sufficient temporal and/or spatial resolution for localized and short - term cloud analysis over a particular area .",
    "this is where ground - based whole sky imagers ( wsis ) offer a compelling alternative  @xcite .",
    "the images obtained from these devices provide high - resolution data about local cloud formation , movement , and other atmospheric phenomena .",
    "segmentation is one of the first steps in sky / cloud image analysis .",
    "it remains a challenging task because of the non - rigid , feature - less , and poorly - defined structure of clouds , whose shape also changes continuously over time .",
    "thus , classical image segmentation approaches based on shape priors @xcite are not suitable .",
    "furthermore , the wide range of lighting conditions ( direct sunlight to completely covered skies ) adds to the difficulty .      as color is the most discriminating feature in sky",
    "/ cloud images , most works in the literature use color for cloud segmentation .",
    "long et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ratio of red and blue channels from rgb color space is a good candidate for segmentation and tuned corresponding thresholds to create binary masks .",
    "heinle et al .",
    "@xcite exploited the difference of red and blue channels for successful detection and subsequent labeling of pixels .",
    "liu et al .",
    "@xcite also used the difference of red and blue channels in their superpixel - based cloud segmentation framework .",
    "souza et al .",
    "@xcite used the saturation ( s ) channel for calculating cloud coverage .",
    "mantelli - neto et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the locus of cloud pixels in the rgb color model .",
    "li et al .",
    "@xcite proposed cloud detection using an adaptive threshold technique in the normalized blue / red channel .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a cloud detection framework using superpixel classification of image features .    in these existing methods in the literature for cloud segmentation ,",
    "the selection of color models and channels has not been studied systematically .",
    "many existing approaches @xcite use combinations of red and blue channels , which is a sensible choice , because the sky is predominantly blue due to the rayleigh scattering of light at shorter wavelengths .",
    "however , we are not aware of any experimental analysis presented regarding the efficacy of these color channels in sky / cloud image segmentation .",
    "furthermore , all of the above methods rely on manually - defined parameters and case - based decisions for segmentation .",
    "these make the methods somewhat ad - hoc and prone to errors .",
    "finally , most of them assign binary labels by design , which further reduces their flexibility and robustness .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to propose a robust framework for color - based cloud segmentation under any illumination conditions , including a systematic analysis of color channels .",
    "the framework is based on partial least squares ( pls ) regression and provides a straightforward , parameter - free supervised segmentation method .",
    "we show that our approach is robust and offers a superior performance across two different databases as compared to current state - of - the - art algorithms .",
    "furthermore , it allows annotating each pixel with a degree of _ belongingness _ to the sky or cloud category , instead of the usual binary labeling .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we presented an analysis of color channels for sky / cloud images captured by whole - sky cameras , which is an important pre - requisite for better segmentation .",
    "the fuzzy c - means clustering method we used in that work however suffers from similar shortcomings as other existing cloud segmentation methods .",
    "the main novel contributions of the present manuscript compared to our earlier work include :    * introduction of a large public sky / cloud image database with segmentation masks ; * extensive evaluation of color components and selection of appropriate color channels on two different sky / cloud image databases ; * robust learning - based framework for sky / cloud segmentation that outperforms existing methods .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : color - spaces ] introduces the color spaces under consideration and describes the statistical tools used for subsequent evaluation .",
    "section [ sec : prob - segment ] discusses the supervised probabilistic segmentation framework .",
    "the sky / cloud databases used for evaluation , including our new swimseg database , are presented in section [ sec : database ] .",
    "an exhaustive analysis of color channels is performed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : result - segment ] presents the experimental evaluation of the segmentation framework , followed by a discussion of the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we describe the color models and channels we consider in this paper and present the statistical tools for evaluating their usefulness in sky / cloud image analysis .",
    "specifically , we use principal component analysis ( pca ) to check the degree of correlation between the color channels and to identify those that capture the most variance .",
    "loading factors from the primary principal component as well as the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve for a simple thresholding applied directly to the color values of a given channel serve as indicators of a channel s suitability for cloud classification .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 color channels and components @xmath1 ( see table [ ps ] ) .",
    "they comprise color spaces rgb , hsv , yiq , @xmath2 , different red - blue combinations ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , and chroma @xmath6 .",
    ".color spaces and components used for analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "there are three primary advantages of our proposed approach compared to other cloud detection algorithms .",
    "first , our cloud segmentation framework is not based on any pre - defined assumptions about color spaces and does not place any restrictions on the type of input images .",
    "we systematically compare different color channels and identify the most suitable ones .",
    "we also explain the reason for their better performance based on rigorous statistical evaluations in two datasets .",
    "second , many existing cloud segmentation algorithms rely on a set of thresholds , conditions , and/or parameters that are manually defined for a particular sky / cloud image database .",
    "our proposed cloud segmentation approach is entirely learning - based and thus provides a systematic solution to training for a given database .",
    "third , conventional algorithms provide a binary output image from the input sky / cloud image .",
    "although these binary images are informative in most cases , they lack flexibility and robustness .",
    "we have no indication of the effectiveness of the thresholding of the input image . in reality , because of the nature of clouds and cloud images , it is undoubtedly better to employ a _",
    "soft _ thresholding approach .",
    "our proposed approach achieves a probabilistic classification of cloud pixels .",
    "this is very informative as it provides a general sense of _ belongingness _ of pixels to the cloud class .",
    "however , as only binary ground - truth images are available , we convert these probability maps into binary images for performing a quantitative evaluation of our algorithm . in our future work",
    ", we plan to extend this analysis by creating _",
    "probabilistic ground truth _ images , where the ground truth of the input images is generated by aggregating annotations from multiple experts .    finally , from the extensive experiments on the two datasets ( cf .",
    "table  [ scoretable ] ) , we observe that the performance with images from the swimseg database is generally better than for hyta , even though the behavior of color channels is similar in both ( i.e.  the same color channels do well for both swimseg and hyta ) .",
    "we believe this is because the images in swimseg were captured with a camera that has been calibrated for color , illumination , and geometry  @xcite .",
    "naturally , many challenges remain , for example : how do different weather conditions affect the classification performance ?",
    "the weather in singapore is relatively constant in terms of temperature and humidity , with little variation throughout the year .",
    "usually it is either partly cloudy , or rainy ( in which case the sky will be completely overcast , making segmentation unnecessary ) . as a result , our database is not suitable for investigating this question .",
    "completely overcast conditions can be dealt with by simple pre - processing of the image before segmentation , e.g.  by calculating the number of clusters , as we have done in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of color spaces and components , and proposed a probabilistic approach using pls - based regression for the segmentation of ground - based sky / cloud images .",
    "our approach is entirely learning - based and does not require any manually - defined thresholds , conditions , or parameters at any stage of the algorithm .",
    "we also release an extensive sky / cloud image database captured with a calibrated ground - based camera that has been annotated with ground - truth segmentation masks .",
    "our future work will include the annotation of a database with probabilistic ground - truth segmentation maps as well as the extension of this method to high - dynamic - range ( hdr ) images .",
    "going beyond segmentation , it is also important to classify clouds into different types @xcite or estimate cloud altitude and movement @xcite , which are both part of our current research .",
