    "it is worthwhile to note that replacing the s@xmath93 terminal with a n metal reservoir would completely hinder the extraction of a finite spin - polarized current for @xmath69 .",
    "this stems from the insensitivity of the tunneling current in a nin junction to the n region temperature .",

    "we shall further comment the impact of relaxation in this setup as compared to that of fig . 1 by inspecting fig . 14(c ) and figs .",
    "11(b - d ) .",
    "in particular they show that while electron - electron interaction is crucial in suppressing @xmath133 in the former case , it is much less important in the setup of fig .",
    "the reason stems from the fact that while in the present case the electric current is spin - dependent only thanks to presence of spin - dependent distribution functions in the n region ( as expressed by eq .",
    "24 ) , in the setup of fig .",
    "1 the spin selectivity originates from both the distribution functions @xmath78 and the spin - dependent superconducting dos ( see eqs . 10 and 11 ) . from this follows that , in the first setup , current polarization will completely vanish at quasiequilibrium ( where the quasiparticle distribution functions result to be identical and spin - independent ) , while in the second system spin polarization will persists also for identical thermal distribution functions owing to the additional spin selectivity provided by spin - split dos in the superconductors .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the nonequilibrium spin - dependent transport properties in superconductor - normal metal tunnel nanostructures , where the superconductors present a proximity - induced _ effective _ exchange field ( equivalent to that of a superconductor in a magnetic field ) .",
    "the latter is due to the proximity of a ferromagnetic thin layer which exerts , under appropriate conditions , a nonlocal influence .",
    "we have computed the quasiparticle distributions of a normal metal layer tunnel coupled to two superconductors with non - collinear exchange fields . in the full nonequilibrium limit ,",
    "i.e. , in the absence of any inelastic relaxation mechanisms , the distribution functions depend on spin and display unusual features , such as population inversion and double - step shape , depending on the bias voltage applied to the superconductors .",
    "spin - dependence persists also in the presence of inelastic coulomb interaction , which produces a smoothing of the sharp features and tends to drive electrons into the quasiequilibrium regime , where the energy relaxation is strong enough to allow electrons to thermalize . this interesting behavior is reflected in the current - voltage characteristic , which shows a strong dependence on the relative orientation of the exchange fields existing in the superconductors .",
    "notably , even in the quasiequilibrium regime , a huge tunnel magnetoresistance ratio and a complete current spin - polarization were found over a wide range of bias voltages and for realistic parameters .",
    "the impact of the exchange field as well as of the presence of subgap states in the dos of the superconductors have been addressed .",
    "we have characterized the out - of - equilibrium distribution functions through an `` effective temperature '' and an `` effective chemical potential '' , defined in an operative sense .",
    "we have found that such effective temperatures are strongly spin - dependent for anti - parallel exchange fields , the relative temperature difference being as high as @xmath182 .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the possibility of producing spin - polarized currents by coupling the n region to an additional superconducting lead , finding that @xmath135 spin - polarization is realistically achievable .",
    "this effect is fairly robust against the occurrence of inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "we shall finally comment on some possible applications of the structures here presented .",
    "an immediate first application of this system is the implementation of storage cell elements , thanks to the very large tmr values [ see fig .  [ tf](a ) ] .",
    "magnetic - field - controlled current switches can be envisioned as well [ see fig .  [ ts](a ) ] .",
    "importantly , power dissipation is intrinsically limited owing to the small currents driven through nis junctions .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath183 and aluminum ( al ) electrodes at @xmath184 k , a dissipated power in the range of @xmath185 w can be achieved for @xmath186 .",
    "this makes this setup attractive for low - dissipation cryogenic applications . in light of a realistic implementation , ferromagnetic alloys such as cu@xmath187ni@xmath188 @xcite or pd@xmath187ni@xmath188 @xcite ( which allow fine tuning of @xmath189 through a proper choice of @xmath190 ) are promising candidates .",

    "it turns out that @xmath24 in the range @xmath196 can be achieved . in such nanostructures",
    "the bias voltage con be fed through outer normal metal electrodes , tunnel coupled to the ferromagnetic layers in order to prevent depolarization of the f electrodes .",
    "this would result in adding in series extra resistances which could be easily engineered in order to minimize the induced correction to both tunnel magnetoresistance and operating voltage .",

    "<S> the impact of inelastic collisions on their properties is addressed . as a result , the electric current flowing through the system is found to be strongly dependent on the relative angle between exchange fields , giving rise to a huge value of magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the current presents a complete spin - polarization in a wide range of bias voltages , even in the quasiequilibrium case . in the nonequilibrium limit </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the distributions with an  effective  temperature , which turns out to be strongly spin - dependent , though quite sensitive to inelastic collisions . by tunnel coupling the normal region to an additional superconducting electrode </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to implement a spin - polarized current source of both spin species , depending on the bias voltages applied . </S>"
