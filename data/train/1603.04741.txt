    "quantum effects from closed ( or periodic ) classical orbits in a microscopic system have been explored in many different branches of physics@xcite .",
    "one of the most typical processes in atomic and molecular physics is the photoionization of neutral atoms or the photodetachment of negative ions in external fields@xcite .",
    "its studies often promise an intuitive picture of the embedded dynamics , which not only reveals an interesting correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics , but also allows a better control and manipulation on a microscopic scale .",
    "the general physical picture and formalism are known as closed - orbit theory@xcite which has been applied or extended in different situations .",
    "however , almost all the systems investigated before are time independent and therefore energy conserving@xcite .",
    "time - dependent systems have been rarely studied , the one exception being the photoionization of neutral atoms in a static electric field plus a weak oscillating field@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate an application of closed - orbit theory for the photodetachment of negative ions in a time - dependent electric field .",
    "many kinds of specific field profiles , like a microwave field or a low - frequency laser pulse , could be applied to study the time - dependent effect of an external field on the photodetachment rate of negative ions .",
    "recently , a strong single - cycle terahertz ( thz ) pulse has been available in a table - top experiment . as a result of its simplicity and other peculiarities ,",
    "the single - cycle thz pulse has been applied in exploring the ionization dynamics of rydberg atoms@xcite , as well as controlling the alignment and orientation of polar molecules@xcite .",
    "inspired in part by these results , we consider the possibility of using a single - cycle thz field to manipulate the photodetachment dynamics of negative ions .",
    "temporal interferences in the time - dependent electron flux ( or the angle - resolved energy spectrum ) at large distances were investigated in a previous paper@xcite , by extending the original idea for traditional photodetachment microscopy in a static electric field@xcite .",
    "the classical trajectory of the photoelectron was tracked from the negative - ion center to a large distance .",
    "we found that some trajectories could return to the source region when the single - cycle pulse is strong enough .",
    "this observation of closed classical orbits constitutes the main motivation of this work .    following the general picture depicted by closed - orbit theory@xcite",
    ", an external field can modulate the photon absorption rate in the photoionization and photodetachment processes by driving back an outgoing electron wave to the source region where the initial bound state is localized .",
    "the returning electron wave interferes with the outgoing wave near the source center .",
    "each closed classical orbit corresponds to one sinusoidal term in the total modulation function .",
    "therefore , an oscillatory photodetachment rate should be expected if the applied single - cycle thz pulse is strong enough that the electron can be driven back to the source region .",
    "this is indeed observed in our quantum simulations for a strong thz pulse . in fig .",
    "1 , a representative case is shown for the negative hydrogen ion ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "it can be observed that the photodetachment rate is quite stable in a weak thz pulse with the maximum field strength @xmath1 , but oscillates in a complex way when a stronger thz pulse is used such as @xmath2 . by examining the classical trajectories ,",
    "no closed orbit is found for @xmath1 while , three different types of closed orbits are found when @xmath2 .",
    "these observations are qualitatively consistent with the general predictions of closed - orbit theory . to quantitatively understand the oscillatory behavior as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we have to generalize the existing formulas to include time - dependent field effects .",
    "it turns out that the generalized formulas agree very well with exact quantum simulations .    .",
    "the thz pulse strengths @xmath3 are given in the legend for different lines , respectively .",
    "all the curves are normalized using the value of the photodetachment rate at @xmath4 without the single - cycle pulse applied ( @xmath5 ) . ]    comparing with the well - established closed - orbit theory for the photodetachment dynamics in a static electric field@xcite , the generalized formulas mainly have two differences as follows .",
    "( a ) a static electric field can always guarantee one and only one closed orbit , and the oscillation phases are opposite between the photodetachment rates from an @xmath6-wave source like negative fluorine ion ( f@xmath0 ) and a @xmath7-wave source like h@xmath0 . while , in a time - dependent electric field , no closed orbit exists if the maximum momentum transfer is not large enough , but more than one closed orbit may be found if the field is strong .",
    "determined by a simple property of each closed orbit , both the in - phase and antiphase oscillations can be observed by comparing the time - dependent photodetachment rates of h@xmath0 and f@xmath0 .",
    "( b ) an electron s kinetic energy is conserved if it was driven back to the ion by a static field .",
    "in contrast , when the electron is driven back by a time - dependent electric field , its kinetic energy is usually different from its initial value .",
    "consequently , each sinusoidal term in the total modulation function is multiplied by an additional coefficient related to both the electron s outgoing and returning momenta along the corresponding closed classical orbit .",
    "although the single - cycle thz pulses are specifically studied , the presented theory is quite general .",
    "the related formulas can be used directly for the photodetachment of negative ions in any other forms of the time - dependent electric field , as long as the whole photodetachment process can be divided approximately into two steps : one - photon absorption from a weak laser field followed by the photoelectron motion in the applied external field .",
    "the only additional work needed for a specific system is to identify all the possible closed classical orbits .",
    "we note that an experiment has been done for the photodetachment of negative chlorine ions in a microwave field@xcite , and several theoretical studies have also been reported@xcite .",
    "however , all of the previous time - dependent treatments assumed the applied field varied slowly enough that the electron was driven by a constant electric field during each detachment event , which approximately corresponds to the situation in the reported experiment@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our current work provides further insight into the general cases of a time - dependent electric field .    in the following section , the theoretical model with a specific single - cycle thz pulse",
    "is briefly summarized , as well as the numerical method we used for quantum simulations .",
    "the three types of closed classical orbits are identified in sec . , and their corresponding returning waves are specified in sec . .",
    "the general formulas for the time - dependent photodetachment rate are presented in sec . by extending the standard closed - orbit theory for the photodetachment of negative ions in a static electric field . some calculations and discussions",
    "are presented in sec . , followed by a brief conclusion in sec . .",
    "atomic units are used throughout this work unless specified otherwise .",
    "we choose to study the photodetachment of negative ions ( h@xmath0 and f@xmath0 ) in a single - cycle thz pulse as a specific system , based on several simple reasons as introduced above .",
    "most importantly , this system has almost all the essential elements expected for the other general cases , which can be seen clearly in the following sections . in addition , a numerical solution of schrdinger s equation is also possible as long as the single - cycle pulse strength is not extremely large as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , which allows us to examine the accuracy of closed - orbit theory .",
    "the details of the theoretical model has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we give a brief summary and present the necessary equations related to our present work . we assume the weak laser field and the applied single - cycle thz pulse are both linearly polarized along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the influence of the thz pulse is negligible on the initial ground state of the negative ion .",
    "the much higher frequency of the laser field relative to the thz pulse allows the whole photodetachment process to be approximated as two successive steps : the weakly - bound electron in a short - range potential well is first released by absorbing one photon from the weak laser field , and then the photoelectron motion after escaping from the atom center is mainly guided by the single - cycle thz pulse .    as in our previous paper@xcite , we restrict the weak laser field within a finite width as in fig .",

    "consequently , their contributions in eq . ( [ modulation_sum ] ) are negligible compared with those contributed by the closed orbits starting much later , as a result of their associated much weaker amplitudes @xmath88 according to eq .",

    "3(c ) is mainly caused by the different @xmath29 values associated with the wave source property , while , the almost equal oscillation amplitudes observed in both figs .",

    "this explains the small discrepancy between the modified results and the correct calculations in fig .",
    "besides the overall agreement , an obvious discrepancy can be found near @xmath161 in fig .",
    "this is because the electron experiences a soft return as in fig .",
    "2(c ) where the returning momentum is zero . accordingly , as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) , the oscillation amplitude from correct calculations appears smaller than that given by the modified results without the term @xmath148 included in eq .",
    "( [ modulation_nu ] ) .",
    "there are mainly three differences between the cases in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) and that in fig .",
    "first , all the closed orbits almost contribute equally to the oscillation amplitudes in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) as a result of their similar durations .",
    "second , compared with those parameters in fig .",
    "6(a ) , the field strength is weaker in fig .",
    "6(b ) and the photon energy is higher in fig .",
    "if we make a corresponding change in fig . 2 after fig .",
    "4(a ) or fig .",
    "5(a ) , the obtained returning momenta are almost always smaller than the initial values .",
    "this is the main reason why the modified results give a larger amplitude than the correct calculations in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) .",
    "the third important difference is that the time range for the first- and second - type closed orbits in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 5(a ) is much more localized near the time instant of a soft return than that in fig .",
    "this is another origin for the large discrepancy observed near @xmath162 in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) .",
    "an additional interesting effect related to the soft return is the discontinuity of the modified results as in fig .",
    "6 , which is caused by the sign change of @xmath151 on the two sides of the softly - returning time .",
    "another interesting aspect related to our present work is about the static - field approximation in a long wave - length limit of the applied oscillating field .",
    "as introduced in sec . , it has been found that the static - field approximation for each photodetachment event works very well for an experiment in a strong microwave field@xcite .",
    "our current theory has already allowed us to examine this simple quasi - static picture from a time - dependent viewpoint . for this purpose , we take h@xmath0 for instance , and compare the time - dependent photodetachment rate given by eq .",
    "( [ modulation_sum ] ) with the quasi - static result obtained from@xcite @xmath163~,\\ ] ] where @xmath164 denoting the classical action of an electron returned back to the source region along the unique closed orbit in a static electric field .",
    "some specific calculations are shown in figs .",
    "7 and 8 by varying the single - cycle pulse duration and strength , respectively .",
    "it can be found that the time - dependent calculations indeed approximate the quasi - static results gradually when the field oscillation period gets longer or the field strength becomes larger .",
    "the agreement observed in figs .",
    "7 and 8 is best near the field peak position and worst near the zero - field locations .",
    "however , the contribution in the time - averaged observations mainly comes from the oscillations near the field peak position because both the oscillation amplitude and period near the zero - field locations are too small to give a finite averaged signal , which confirms the validity of the static field approximation used before . in fig .",
    "7(d ) , the returning - time plot is given for the relevant closed orbits in fig .",
    "7(c ) , which illustrates the physics behind the agreement observed in figs . 7 and 8 . although the three types of closed orbits as in fig .",
    "2 are all being there , only those closed orbits located near the line @xmath165 in fig .",
    "7(d ) have an observable effect in the oscillation amplitude of the photodetachment rate , because their durations @xmath166 are much shorter than the others , and the associated returning - wave amplitudes @xmath88 in eqs .",
    "( [ amplitude01 ] ) and ( [ amplitude02 ] ) are large enough .",
    "motivated by our recent studies on the temporal interferences in the photodetachment of negative ions driven by a single - cycle thz pulse@xcite , we examined the possible influences of a single - cycle thz pulse on the time - dependent photodetachment rate .",
    "we found that a weak thz pulse can not change the total photodetachment rate .",
    "however , if the applied thz pulse gets strong enough , the photodetachment rate oscillates complicatedly . on the other hand",
    ", we noticed that some classical trajectories of the photoelectron can be driven back to the source region by a strong single - cycle thz pulse .",
    "these observations remind us of a general picture already recognized in the standard closed - orbit theory@xcite , which addresses the correspondence between the oscillatory photoionization ( or photodetachemnt ) rate and the possible closed classical orbits embedded in the system .    to quantitatively understand the complex structures observed in the time - dependent photodetachment rate , the standard closed - orbit theory for the photodetachment in a static electric field has been generalized to a time - dependent form which agrees well with exact quantum simulations .",
    "the established formulas reveal a simple dependence of the photodetachment - rate oscillations on the properties of both the wave source and the closed classical orbits existing in the system . depending on the relative direction of the returning orbit with respect to its initially - outgoing direction , the photodetachment rates for",
    "different negative ions such as h@xmath0 and f@xmath0 might oscillate in phase or out of phase .",
    "in contrast to the case of a static electric field@xcite , the oscillation amplitude of the photodetachment rate contributed by each closed orbit has an additional term determined by the electron returning momentum which is usually different from the initially - outgoing momentum .",
    "as the applied electric field gets stronger or its oscillation period becomes longer , the oscillatory behavior of the photodetachment rate is more and more like that obtained from the static - field approximation as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the presented theory provides a clear and intuitive picture for the photodetachment dynamics driven by a general time - dependent electric field . benefiting from the correlation between the electron launch time and its later - returning time , a similar pump - probe technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite may be a possible candidate in future experiments for exploring the quantum effect of closed classical orbits from a time - dependent viewpoint .",
