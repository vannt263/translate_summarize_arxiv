    "the relation between resonances and deep inelastic structure functions has been the subject of considerable interest recently .",
    "this has been partly prompted by recent high precision data from jefferson lab @xcite on the unpolarized @xmath2 structure function of the proton in the resonance region , which showed a striking similarity , when averaged over resonances , to the structure function measured at much higher energies in the deep inelastic region .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed some time ago by bloom and gilman @xcite , who found that when integrated over the mass of the inclusive hadronic final state , @xmath3 , the scaling structure function at high @xmath1 , @xmath4 , smoothly averages that measured in the region dominated by low - lying resonances , @xmath5 , @xmath6 the integrand on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ bgdual ] ) represents the structure function in the resonance region at low @xmath1 , while that on the right - hand - side corresponds to the scaling function , measured in the deep inelastic region at high @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is described by leading twist , perturbative qcd , as an incoherent sum over quark flavors , @xmath7 ; the former involves coherent excitation of resonances .",
    "global duality is said to hold after integration over all @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ bgdual ] ) .",
    "this equality can be related to the suppression of higher twist contributions to moments of the structure function @xcite , in which the total moment becomes dominated by the leading twist ( @xmath8 independent ) component at some lower value of @xmath1 .",
    "information on all coherent interaction dynamics is subsequently lost . a more local form of duality is also observed @xcite , in which the equality in eq .",
    "( [ bgdual ] ) holds for restricted regions of @xmath3 integration  specifically , for the three prominent resonance regions at @xmath9  gev .",
    "the duality between the resonance and scaling structure functions is also being investigated in other structure functions , such as the longitudinal structure function @xcite , and spin dependent structure functions of the proton and neutron @xcite . for spin - dependent structure functions , in particular , the workings of duality are more intricate , as the difference of cross sections no longer needs to be positive .",
    "an example is the contribution of the @xmath10 resonance to the @xmath11 structure function of the proton , which is large and negative at low @xmath1 , but may become positive at higher @xmath1 .",
    "early work within the su(6 ) symmetric quark model @xcite showed how the ratios of various deep inelastic structure functions at @xmath12 , both spin dependent and independent , could be dual to a sum over @xmath13 resonances in the su(6)@xmath14=*56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 representations . with the emergence of precision data , showing detailed and interesting @xmath0 dependence as @xmath17 , various questions arise :    * how do changes in ratios as @xmath17 relate to the pattern of @xmath13 resonances identified in the quark model @xcite ?",
    "* are certain families ( spin - flavor correlations ) of resonances required to die out at large @xmath1 in order to maintain duality ?",
    "if so , can electroproduction of specific examples of such resonances test this ?",
    "* can such a program reveal the flavor - spin dependence of short distance forces in the qcd bound state ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to make a first orientation towards answering such questions .",
    "quark models based on su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry provide benchmark descriptions of baryon spectra , as well as transitions to excited @xmath13 states . to allow the origins of duality to remain manifest throughout our discussion",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the framework of the quark model , but consider the effects of su(6 ) breaking explicitly .",
    "such models serve as convenient laboratories for examining the generality of the quark - hadron duality phenomenon in more realistic scenarios than in earlier discussions .",
    "the duality between the simplest su(6 ) quark parton model results @xcite for ratios of structure functions with sums over the * 56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 coherent @xmath13 excitations was described in refs .",
    "an essential feature of those analyses was that su(6 ) was exact and that exotics in the @xmath18-channel were suppressed . in a global sense",
    "such results are self - consistent : the absence of @xmath18-channel exotics equates with an absence of @xmath19 couplings , and hence , in effect , to the presence only of incoherent diagrams where the photons couple to the same quark , @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) .",
    "although the @xmath21-channel sum was shown to be dual for ratios of incoherent quantities @xcite , this alone did not explain why ( or if ) any individual sum over states scaled .",
    "recently , the transition from resonances to scaling has been explored in microscopic models at the quark level .",
    "the phenomenological quark model duality of refs .",
    "@xcite was recently shown @xcite to arise in a simple model of spinless constituents . a model in which the hadron consisted of a point - like scalar `` quark '' bound to an infinitely massive core by a harmonic oscillator potential",
    "was used @xcite to explicitly demonstrate how a sum over infinitely narrow resonances can lead to a structure function which scales in the @xmath22 limit .",
    "these ideas have been further developed @xcite to give an increasingly solid model underpinning of this phenomenological duality .    since the original quark model predictions were made in the 1970 s , the quantity and quality of structure function data",
    "have improved dramatically .",
    "we now know , for instance , that in some regions of @xmath0 su(6 ) symmetry is badly broken , with the strongest deviations from the naive su(6 ) expectations being prevalent at large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the new data will set challenges for theories of quark - hadron duality .",
    "there are critical questions which now need to be addressed , such as :    * can duality survive locally in @xmath0 , and what do the observed variations in @xmath0 require of @xmath13 excitations if duality is to survive ? *",
    "what families ( spin flavor correlations , or su(6 ) multiplets ) are suppressed as @xmath17 , or equivalently @xmath22 , for duality to hold ?",
    "* does the excitation of low lying prominent @xmath13 resonances , belonging to such families , exhibit such behavior ?",
    "if the @xmath17 systematics for @xmath13 families are not matched by specific @xmath23 transition form factors as a function of @xmath1 , then duality fails .",
    "if , however , they do match , then this can expose the patterns in the flavor - spin dependence of inter - quark forces .    in this paper",
    "we explore the question of whether quark - hadron duality exists in structure functions for the more realistic scenario in which su(6 ) is explicitly broken .",
    "we focus on both electromagnetic and neutrino scattering .",
    "while most of the phenomenological information comes from electron scattering , neutrino - induced reactions provide an important consistency check on the derived duality relations , and predictions for neutrino structure function ratios can be tested once high - intensity neutrino beams become available @xcite . after reviewing the symmetric su(6 ) quark model results for structure functions in section  ii",
    ", we identify in section  iii the necessary patterns of @xmath23 suppression in order to obtain structure functions which are compatible with data and expectations from hard scattering at large @xmath0 and higher @xmath1 . in the process",
    "we derive duality relations for various structure function ratios , in which the breaking of su(6 ) symmetry is parameterized in terms of @xmath0-dependent mixing angles . fixing the mixing angles by the unpolarized neutron to proton structure function ratio data then allows us to make explicit predictions for the @xmath0-dependence of polarization asymmetries for the proton and neutron , under various symmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "experimental signatures for the corresponding @xmath23 suppressions are discussed in section  iv , and conclusions and ideas for future developments summarized in section  v.",
    "the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetric quark model serves as a useful basis in which one may visualize both the principles underpinning the phenomenon of quark - hadron duality and at the same time provide a reasonably close contact with phenomenology . following earlier work in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown by close & isgur @xcite that the structure function ratios of the symmetric quark model can be obtained by summing over appropriate sets of baryon resonances .",
    "higher twist effects , which give rise to violations of duality through non - diagonal quark transitions , such as in the `` cat s ears '' diagram in fig .",
    "1(b ) , can be shown to cancel in a small energy range appropriate for summing over neighboring odd and even parity states . in the su(6 ) quark model this corresponds to summing over states in the * 56*@xmath15 ( @xmath24 ) and * 70*@xmath16 ( @xmath25 ) multiplets , with each representation weighted equally .",
    "the spin - averaged transverse @xmath26 structure function , for instance , in this framework is given by the sum of squares of form factors , @xmath27 , describing the transitions from the nucleon to excited states @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energies of the ground state and excited state , respectively . in terms of photoabsorption cross sections ( or @xmath3 boson absorption cross sections for neutrino scattering ) , the @xmath26 structure function is proportional to the sum @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the cross section for total boson ",
    "nucleon helicity 1/2 ( 3/2 ) .",
    "the spin - dependent @xmath11 structure function , on the other hand , corresponds to the difference @xmath34 .",
    "resonance excitation and deep inelastic scattering in general involve both electric and magnetic multipoles .",
    "excitation in a given partial wave at @xmath35 involves a complicated mix of these .",
    "however , as @xmath1 grows one expects the magnetic multipole to dominate over the electric , even by @xmath36  gev@xmath37 in specific models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent phenomenological analyses of electromagnetic excitations of negative parity resonances suggests that for the prominent @xmath38 resonance the ratio of helicity-1/2 to helicity-3/2 amplitudes is consistent with zero beyond @xmath39  gev@xmath37 @xcite , which corresponds to magnetic dominance .",
    "this dominance of magnetic , or spin flip , interactions at large @xmath1 for @xmath13 excitation matches the dominance of such spin flip in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "for instance , the polarization asymmetry @xmath40 is positive at large @xmath1 , whereas @xmath41 if electric interactions were prominent @xcite .",
    "thus in the present analysis we assume that the interaction with the quark is dominated by the magnetic coupling . in this approximation the @xmath26 and @xmath2 structure functions",
    "are simply related by the callan - gross relation , @xmath42 , independent of the specific models we use for the structure functions themselves .",
    "the relative photoproduction strengths of the transitions from the ground state to the * 56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 are summarized in table  i for the @xmath26 and @xmath11 structure functions of the proton and neutron . for generality , we separate the contributions from the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the ground state nucleon wave function , with strengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the su(6 ) limit corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficients in table  i assume equal weights for the * 56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 multiplets @xcite .",
    "similarly , neutrino - induced transitions to excited states can be evaluated @xcite , and the relative strengths are displayed in table  ii for the proton and neutron .",
    "because of charge conservation , only transitions to decuplet ( isospin-@xmath46 ) states from the proton are allowed .",
    "( note that the overall normalizations of the electromagnetic and neutrino matrix elements in tables  i and ii are arbitrary . )    summing over the full set of states in the * 56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 multiplets leads to definite predictions for neutron and proton structure function ratios , @xmath47 and polarization asymmetries , @xmath48 for @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath51 one finds the classic su(6 ) quark - parton model results @xcite : @xmath52}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for electromagnetic scattering , and @xmath53}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for neutrino scattering , which correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the quark level results are easily deduced by considering the wave function of a proton in the su(6 ) limit , polarized in the @xmath56 direction @xcite : @xmath57 where the subscript 0 or 1 denotes the total spin of the two - quark component .",
    "the neutron wave function is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ pwfn ] ) by interchanging @xmath58 . in this limit ,",
    "apart from charge and flavor quantum numbers , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks in the proton are identical , and , in particular , have the same @xmath0 distributions .",
    "the relations between the structure functions and leading order parton distributions are given in the appendix .",
    "the various structure function ratios in the su(6 ) quark model are listed in the first column of table  iii .",
    "one should point out that these results arise in an ideal world of su(6 ) symmetry where the members of a * 56*@xmath15 or * 70*@xmath16 are each degenerate , with common @xmath1 dependent form factors .",
    "reality is not like that . in the quark model",
    "the usual assignments of the excited states have the nucleon and @xmath61 @xmath10 isobar belonging to the quark spin-@xmath62 @xmath37 * 8 * and quark spin-@xmath46 @xmath63 * 10 * representations of * 56*@xmath15 , respectively , while for the odd parity states the @xmath37 * 8 * representation contains the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the @xmath63 * 8 * contains the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while the isospin-@xmath46 states @xmath69 and @xmath70 belong to the @xmath37 * 10 * representation .",
    "one purpose of this paper will be to investigate the systematics of such su(6 ) breaking which split energy levels , give different @xmath1 dependence to form factors , distort the @xmath59 and @xmath60 flavors and spin distributions , and affect the @xmath17 behaviors via duality .",
    "while the su(6 ) predictions for the structure functions hold approximately at @xmath71 , significant deviations are observed at larger @xmath0 .",
    "empirically , the @xmath60 quark distribution is observed to be much softer than the @xmath59 for @xmath72 @xcite , leading to @xmath73 at large @xmath0 .",
    "also , on the basis of helicity conservation @xcite , one expects that the proton and neutron polarization asymmetries , for both electromagnetic and neutrino scattering , @xmath74 as @xmath17 , in dramatic contrast to the su(6 ) expectations , especially for the neutron , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    in this section",
    "we examine the conditions under which combinations of resonances can reproduce , via quark - hadron duality , the behavior of structure functions in the large-@xmath0 region where su(6 ) breaking effects are most prominent . at the quark level , explicit su(6 )",
    "breaking mechanisms produce different weightings of components of the initial state wave function , eq .",
    "( [ pwfn ] ) , which in turn induces different @xmath0 dependences for the spin and flavor distributions . on the other hand , at the hadronic level su(6 )",
    "breaking in the @xmath23 matrix elements leads to suppression of transitions to specific resonances in the final state , while starting from a symmetric su(6 ) initial state wave function . thus if we admit breaking of the su(6 ) symmetry , then for duality to be manifest the pattern of symmetry breaking in the initial state has to match that in the final state .",
    "note that for a fixed @xmath77 of a given resonance @xmath28 , the resonance peak moves to larger @xmath0 with increasing @xmath1 , since at the resonance peak one has @xmath78 . at low @xmath1 ,",
    "the prominent resonances are spread out in @xmath0 and a necessary condition for duality involves integrating over a range of @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath79  gev . at large @xmath1 for fixed @xmath0 one has large @xmath3 and hence a dense population of overlapping coherent resonance states . in such a circumstance duality",
    "can become locally satisfied . in turn",
    "this kinematics means that if a given resonance at @xmath71 appears at relatively low @xmath1 , the @xmath80 behavior of the resonance contribution to the structure function will be determined by the @xmath81 transition form factor at large @xmath1 .",
    "we shall look therefore for different @xmath1 dependences in the transition form factors to different spin - flavor multiplets , and study their implications for @xmath17 in the sum .",
    "then we shall look at specific examples of resonances having these particular correlations and identify experimental tests of the hypothesis .",
    "the most immediate breaking of the su(6 ) duality could be achieved by varying the overall strengths of the coefficients for the * 56*@xmath15 and * 70*@xmath16 multiplets as a whole . however , since the cancellations of the @xmath23 transitions for the case of @xmath82 occur within each multiplet , a non - zero value of @xmath83 can only be achieved if su(6 ) is broken _ within _ each multiplet rather than _ between _ the multiplets .",
    "some intuition is needed therefore on sensible breaking patterns within the supermultiplets .    turning first to the * 56*@xmath15",
    ", empirical evidence suggests that at high @xmath1 the @xmath84 transition form factor is anomalously suppressed relative to the elastic nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been attributed to spin - dependent forces between quarks , such as from single gluon exchange @xcite , which split the nucleon and @xmath10 masses and necessarily break su(6 ) .",
    "removing the @xmath63 * 10*[*56*@xmath15 ] from the @xmath21-channel sum causes @xmath86 to fall ( to @xmath87 ) , as required phenomenologically , and both @xmath88 and @xmath83 to increase ( to 1 and 2/5 , respectively ) compared with the su(6 ) values ( see column 2 of table  iii .",
    "investigation of the coefficients in tables  i and ii , however , shows that a suppression of the @xmath10 alone is not consistent with quark - hadron duality .",
    "in particular , it gives rise to a @xmath89 ratio , extracted from the electromagnetic structure functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ du_u ] ) in the appendix ) , which is greater than unity , thereby violating a partonic interpretation of the structure functions .",
    "similarly , suppression of all decuplet contributions , namely the @xmath63 * 10 * in the * 56*@xmath15 and @xmath37 * 10 * in the * 70*@xmath16 ( column 3 of table  iii ) , still gives a value for the extracted @xmath89 which exceeds unity .",
    "the reason for the failure of duality here is that eliminating @xmath10 states in the @xmath21-channel sum spoils the cancellation of exotic exchanges in the @xmath18-channel , @xmath90 .",
    "non - exotic * 1 * and * 35 * su(6 ) representations correspond to @xmath91 , thus in the @xmath18-channel these appear as @xmath92 ; when such a diagram is viewed in the @xmath21-channel one sees that in effect it can map onto handbag or leading twist topologies , enabling a partonic interpretation , as shown in fig .",
    "exotic exchanges , such as * 405 * , require @xmath93 in the @xmath18-channel , and map onto higher twist contributions , such as in fig .",
    "these are incompatible with single parton probability interpretations in principle , with the specific @xmath94 result illustrating this .",
    "moreover , the results for the @xmath89 and @xmath95 ratios extracted from the electromagnetic observables , namely @xmath96 and @xmath97 , do not agree with those obtained from the neutrino polarization asymmetries @xmath98 ( column 3 of table  iii .",
    "in addition , for both of these scenarios the ratio @xmath99 extracted from @xmath86 does not match that obtained from @xmath100 .",
    "these are all consequences of the presence of @xmath18-channel exotics in such scenarios , and further underscore the inconsistency of duality with suppression of @xmath10 states alone .",
    "if the characteristic @xmath1 dependence for @xmath10 excitation is indeed due to spin dependence , then it may be that this is a phenomenon realized by all @xmath101 quark couplings , namely @xmath63 * 10*[*56*@xmath15 ] and @xmath63 * 8*[*70*@xmath16 ] .",
    "an immediate observation in this scenario from tables  i and ii is that each of the contributions corresponding to ( the surviving ) quark spin @xmath103 configurations has equal strength for @xmath11 and @xmath26 , which automatically gives unity for the polarization asymmetries @xmath104 .",
    "this simply follows from the ( high @xmath1 ) approximation that only magnetic couplings to quarks contribute , so that only @xmath101 configurations allow non - zero @xmath105 cross sections ( we shall return to this later ) .",
    "more generally , one can observe that duality is satisfied by summing over the individual @xmath103 and @xmath101 contributions separately , @xmath106 @xmath37 * 8*[*56*@xmath15 ] + @xmath37 * 8*[*70*@xmath16 ] + @xmath37 * 8*[*70*@xmath16 ] , and @xmath107 @xmath63 * 10*[*56*@xmath15 ] + @xmath63 * 8*[*70*@xmath16 ] . if the relative contributions of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 channels are weighted by @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , then the ratio of unpolarized neutron to proton structure functions can be written as : @xmath112 and the polarization asymmetries become : @xmath113 the dependence on the mixing angle @xmath114 of these ratios is illustrated in fig .  2 ( dashed curves ) .",

    "a parallel avenue towards determining the spin - flavor asymmetries such as @xmath89 and @xmath95 , which is particularly sensitive to different su(6 ) breaking assumptions , could be provided through a program of semi - inclusive scattering tagging fast pions in the current fragmentation region .",
    "a quantitative description of transition form factors in the quark model at moderate @xmath1 must involve both longitudinal and transverse response , electric and magnetic couplings , as well as hyperfine interactions which explicitly break su(6 ) symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", most of these complications do not affect the main elements of duality , and can obfuscate the basic principles which drive the quark - hadron transition . for reasons of clarity , in the present analysis",
    "we have considered only magnetic transitions , which are expected to dominate at high @xmath1 .",
