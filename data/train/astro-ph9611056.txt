    "coalescing neutron stars are interesting and powerful sources of gravitational waves . these mergers",
    " together with black holes , rapidly rotating neutron stars , and supernovae  are among the most promising candidates ( thorne 1992 ) to be detected with the large gravitational wave experiments that will soon be operational or are currently planned , ligo ( abramovici et al .  1992 ) , virgo ( bradaschia et al .",
    "1991 ) , geo600 ( danzmann et al .  1995a ) , and the space - based lisa ( danzmann et al .",
    "the detectability does not only depend on the strength of the emission , but also on the frequency of the gravitational waves relative to the resonance frequencies of the detectors ( finn & chernoff 1993 ; finn 1994 ) .",
    "only an a priori knowledge of the structure of typical gravitational wave signals allows the extraction of faint signals from a very noisy background .",
    "theoretically predicted wave templates have to be produced by numerical simulations .",
    "additionally to being sources for gravitational waves , coalescing neutron stars ( and its relative , the merger of a neutron star with a black hole ) remain the favorite cosmological model for gamma - ray bursters ( dermer & weiler 1995 ) because the sources are known to exist , the right amount of energy is involved , and the expected merger rates are in agreement with the required gamma - ray burst rates .",
    "the search for gravitational waves thus calls for models of coalescing neutron stars that are numerically highly resolved and as realistic as possible .",
    "several groups have attempted such investigations and have published results . in a series of papers starting with oohara & nakamura ( 1989 )",
    "a japanese group used variations of a grid - based code to find the gravitational wave luminosity for different conditions , e.g.  different masses , initial separation or spins of the neutron stars ( shibata et al .",
    "1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) concentrated on the energy spectrum that gives the energy emitted in gravitational waves at different frequencies .",
    "they discussed the information about the dynamics of the coalescence that may be extracted from a measured spectrum .",
    "focussing on dynamics and stability , rasio & shapiro ( 1994 ) found that _ triaxial _ configurations are formed by the merging of neutron stars with a sufficiently stiff polytropic equation of state .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures occur for adiabatic exponents of 3 or higher ( polytropic index 0.5 or below ) . in this case",
    "the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave emission is substantially larger and the emission proceeds for a longer time after the coalescence .",
    "our treatment of the gravitational wave backreaction is identical to what has been used by shibata et al .",
    "we consider this procedure to be more accurate than the point - mass quadrupole approximation used by davies et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and zhuge et al .",
    "their approximation was used when the neutron stars were still separated and subsequently switched off when the merging took place .",
    "although rasio & shapiro  ( 1994 ) investigated the stability of the neutron star binary orbit in detail , they did not take into account the gravitational radiation reaction at all .",
    "the three investigations done by davies et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and rasio & shapiro ( 1994 ) all used sph codes , whereas our simulations , as well as the ones by shibata et al .  (",
    "1992 ) , were performed with explicit , eulerian , finite - difference grid - based schemes .",
    "the algorithm we use is based on the ppm - scheme of colella & woodward  ( 1984 ) which is a higher - order godunov - type method in that it locally solves riemann problems .",
    "it is thus superior to a particle - based method like sph in the handling of shocks and also has a rather small numerical viscosity compared to other eulerian algorithms and sph .",
    "we chose to compare our numerical scheme with the following three calculations .",
    "( 1 ) `` run  2 '' of zhuge et al .  (",
    "1994 ) was chosen since in this model the neutron stars have masses and radii similar to those in ruffert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( although the equations of state were different ) .",
    "additionally , the published detailed spectral analysis of the gravitational wave emission is well suited for comparisons .",
    "`` model  iii '' of shibata et al .",
    "( 1992 ) was selected , because their numerical scheme is grid - based and the algorithm to treat the gravitational wave backreaction is similar to ours",
    ". therefore differences of the results are associated with differing hydrodynamical integrators and numerical resolution . in both cases  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) ,",
    "polytopic equations of state were used which we also applied in our comparative calculations .",
    "( 3 ) `` model  a64 '' of ruffert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) served for comparison in order to investigate the differences caused by the use of a polytropic equation of state instead of the more realistic equation of state of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ) which allowed ruffert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also to include the effects due to neutrino emission .",
    "we did not select a model computed by davies et al .",
    "( 1994 ) because although their computations were done with a polytropic equation of state , they did not give information about the gravitational wave emission , since their formula was too crude .",
    "rasio & shapiro  ( 1994 ) , on the other hand , were very careful in constructing equilibrium models and in investigating the stability of these models as well as the gravitational wave forms and luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , we preferred for our present investigations a comparison with a run of zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , because ( a ) rasio & shapiro  ( 1994 ) did not include any backreaction of the gravitational waves , and ( b ) the spectra presented by zhuge et al .",

    "we shall specify only the differences of the treatment of the presented polytropic models compared to what has been described in ruffert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the neutron stars are evolved hydrodynamically via the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) developed by colella and woodward ( 1984 ) .",
    "the code is basically newtonian , but contains the terms necessary to describe gravitational waves and their backreaction on the hydrodynamical flow ( blanchet , damour & schfer 1990 ) via energy and angular momentum loss .",
    "the volume integral over the local emission and backreaction terms yields the total gravitational wave luminosity .",
    "all spatial derivatives necessary to compute the gravitational wave terms are implemented as standard centered differences on the grid .",
    "the poisson equations in integral form , necessary for the calculation of the gravitational potential as well as for the wave backreaction , are interpreted as convolution and calculated by fast fourier transform routines : non - periodic grid boundaries are enforced by zero - padding ( e.g.  press et al .",
    "1992 ; eastwood & brownrigg 1979 ) .",
    "the accelerations that follow from the potential are added as source terms into the ppm algorithm . for models",
    "zcm and rjs the number of cubic grid zones in the orbital plane is 64  by  64 , while perpendicular to the orbital plane 16  zones were used with the same zone size in all three dimensions .",
    "we use double the amount of zones ( 128 ) in every spatial direction for model  sno in order to have a similar number of zones ( 121 ) as shibata et al .",
    "we take advantage of the symmetry about the orbital plane to actually calculate only one side of the plane .",
    "a polytropic equation of state , @xmath20 is used which relates the density @xmath21 to the pressure @xmath22 via two parameters , the polytropic constant @xmath5 and the adiabatic exponent @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the polytropic index .",
    "this equation with @xmath5 and @xmath6 chosen to be the same in the whole star was employed to construct the initial model of the neutron star . since",
    "the ppm code is written in conservative form ( not taking into account source terms like gravity ) , the primary variables are the density , the momentum , and the total energy .",
    "one therefore has the choice of using either eq .",
    "[ eq : peos ] to calculate the pressure from the density or the relation @xmath25 to deduce the pressure from the internal energy density @xmath26 .",
    "analytically these formulations are equivalent , but numerical errors may destroy this equivalence . when shocks or viscous shear dissipation occurs in the hydrodynamic calculations , the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : eeos ] is preferable because due to the dissipative processes the parameter @xmath5 of eq .",
    "[ eq : peos ] is not a strict constant in space and time during the simulations .",
    "if one postulates analytical equivalence of the pressure in eq .",
    "[ eq : eeos ] with the polytropic equation of state , eq .",
    "[ eq : peos ] , the generation of thermal energy in shocks manifests itself in a variation of @xmath5 .",
    "[ eq : peos ] was used to construct the initial model and eq .",
    "[ eq : eeos ] to compute the hydrodynamic evolution . due to these simple equations of state , effects of neutrino emission , absorption or annihilation",
    "were not included in the present simulations .",
    "our initial setup involves placing two identical spherical neutron stars at some distance from each other and giving them an initial velocity .",
    "we prescribe the initial orbital velocities of the coalescing neutron stars according to the motions of point masses , as computed from the quadrupole formula .",
    "the tangential components of the velocities of the neutron star centers correspond to kepler velocities on circular orbits , while the radial velocity components reflect the emission of gravitational waves leading to the inspiral of the orbiting bodies ( for details , see ruffert et al .  1996 ) .",
    "a spin of the neutron stars around their respective centers is _ not _ added .",
    "thus the initial state of the neutron star binary is defined by the following parameters : ( a ) center - to - center distance between the neutron stars and ( b ) three out of the following five quantities : mass , radius , and central density of the neutron star , and polytropic constant @xmath5 , and adiabatic exponent @xmath6 of the equation of state .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations presented in this work follow the dynamical evolution and the gravitational wave emission of two merging neutron stars modeled as polytropes .",
    "we compared our results with three models published earlier and tried to obtain information about uncertainties and differences caused by the numerical scheme employed for integrating the hydrodynamic equations , by the numerical resolution and setup of the initial model , and by the use of a polytropic equation of state instead of the physical equation of state of lattimer & swesty  ( 1991 ) .",
    "we chose the following three models for comparison : ( a ) `` run  2 '' of zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , ( b ) `` model  iii '' of shibata et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and ( c ) `` model  a64 '' of ruffert et al .",
    "we attempted to construct the initial configurations as similar to these models as possible and also used polytropic equations of state which were the same or which guaranteed to reproduce the properties ( mass , central density , radius ) of the neutron stars .",
    "run  2 of zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is different from our model  zcm in ( a ) one numerical aspect : zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) used an sph algorithm while we employed the grid - based ppm scheme and ( b ) two physical aspects : ( i ) the gravitational wave backreaction is prescribed in an _ ad hoc _ way by zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , because it is included in the computation when the neutron stars are still separate but switched off during the merging process ; ( ii ) both computations start with different initial separations and tidal deformations .",
    "our model  zcm seems to retain a `` double core '' structure and thus a large quadrupolar deformation during the merging for a longer time than run  2 .",
    "this has two consequences : on the one hand , the secondary and tertiary maxima of the gravitational wave luminosity are significantly higher in our calculation , and on the other hand , the peak in the gravitational wave spectrum at a frequency of @xmath0  khz is more prominent , too ( a first maximum is present at about 1.3  khz ) .",
    "both effects are caused by a more extended post - coalescence period in model  zcm where the merger performs `` ringing '' and `` wobbling '' motions and emits more power in gravitational waves at frequencies around @xmath0  khz .",
    "we find a local minimum of the gravitational wave spectrum at a frequency of about @xmath27  khz in good agreement with run  2 of zhuge et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although this minimum is not quite as deep in our calculation .",
    "the integrated gravitational wave energy in both models is also nearly the same , implying that the stronger emission of our model  zcm at high frequencies is accompanied by a deficit at lower frequencies , which we indeed find in the band @xmath281.1  khz .",
    "we suppose that these differences are mainly caused by the larger numerical viscosity of the sph  code and the comparatively poor resolution with only @xmath29  particles in the computation of zhuge et al .",
    "although the two main physical differences ( initial tidal deformations , backreaction implementation ) could in principle be also partly responsible for the wobbling , we assume their effect to be small : ( i ) the initial disequilibrium due to tidal deformations has been shown ( ruffert et al .",
    "1996 ) to be damped out within a time shorter than the ringing , and ( ii ) the gravitational backreaction has a damping effect in the longer - term merging process .",
    "shibata et al .  (",
    "1992 ) performed their calculations with a finite difference grid - based explicit eulerian code just as we do , albeit with a different hydrodynamical integrator , a second order advection using a method proposed by leblanc ( see appendix  a of oohara & nakamura  1989 ) , which does not make use of a riemann solver .",
    "they incorporated the gravitational wave backreaction in a way conceptually equivalent to our treatment .",
    "their grid had @xmath30  zones . to solve the poisson equation ,",
    "the incomplete cholesky decomposition and conjugate gradient ( iccg ) method by meijerink & van der vorst ( 1977 ) was used .",
    "contrary to this we implemented a fast fourier method and our grids had a size of 128@xmath31128 ( and 32 zones vertical to the orbital plane ) .",
    "however , long before any hydrodynamical interaction between the neutron stars occur , at @xmath32  ms when the neutron stars just barely touch each other , the maximum density on the grid showed an extreme value in the calculations of shibata et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which we were unable to reproduce in our model  sno .",
    "this difference is difficult to explain and we can only speculate that it might be associated with the choice of shibata et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to use configurations in rotational equilibrium for the two neutron stars which were given spins in the frame that corotates with their orbital revolution . because these spins of the stars were absent for an observer in an inertial frame and because shibata et al .",
    "( 1992 ) did not construct equilibrium configurations in the common gravitational field of the two stars ( which would make more sense ) , we did not follow their choice but started our simulations as usual with spherical neutron star models .",
    "this obvious discrepancy causes an initial delay of the merging by @xmath33  ms in our model  sno compared to model  iii of shibata et al .",
    "nevertheless , the gravitational wave luminosity amplitude of their model and of our simulation coincide surprisingly well to within 10% .      in a third comparative study we performed a simulation , model  rjs , with initial conditions ( neutron star masses , radii , central densities , initial separation , and velocities ) like those used in model  a64 of ruffert et al .",
    "the only major difference was that instead of the physcial equation of state of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 )  which also allowed us to include neutrino physics in the computation  we used a polytropic equation of state in model  rjs with the initial value of the parameter @xmath5 and the constant adiabatic index @xmath6 adjusted such that the initial neutron star properties are reproduced .",
    "we found the overall dynamical evolution during the coalescence , e.g.  timescale of merging , formation of spiral - arm - like structures of matter spun off the neutron star surfaces by tidal and centrifugal forces , post - merging oscillations and pulsations , to be very similar in both models .",
    "this is particularly clearly seen in the behaviour of the neutron star separation and of the maximum density on the grid as functions of time . correspondingly , the gravitational wave luminosity , gravitational wave form , and gravitational wave spectrum share the main structural features .",
    "the peak gravitational wave luminosity and the total energy emitted in gravitational waves are only about 20% smaller in the polytropic model .",
    "the gravitational wave forms are very similar but have the tendency to develop a slight phase shift after the two neutron stars have merged into one object .",
    "these minor differences reflect the fact that the properties of the lattimer & swesty  ( 1991 ) equation of state in the nuclear and supranuclear regimes  which are most important for the neutron star structure as well as for the gravitational wave signature during the merger  are sufficiently well reproduced .",
    "this is ensured by our determination of the equation of state parameters  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 by prescribing the same mass , central density and radii of the neutron star models constructed with the polytropic equation of state and with the lattimer & swesty  ( 1991 ) equation of state .",
    "the minor differences of both calculations , the roughly 20% smaller peak emission of gravitational waves in the polytropic case and the small phase shift of the gravitational wave forms , are mainly caused by differences of the equations of state in the subnuclear regime ( @xmath34  g/@xmath35 ) . in this regime in particular ,",
    "the description of the properties of neutron star matter with an equation of state with a uniformly chosen adiabatic exponent  @xmath6 is inadequate . with the employed value of @xmath36 the equation of state at subnuclear densities is by far too stiff . as a result ,",
    "the neutron star surface layers in model  rjs were more extended and the density decline less sharp compared to model  a64 in ruffert et al .",
    "morerover , during merging the neutron star surfaces came into contact earlier in model  rjs which moderated the dynamical interaction of the stars and reduced the luminosity outburst of gravitational waves during this phase . after merging , the overestimated stiffness of the equation of state led to a slightly less compact central body of the merger in model  rjs and to a significantly more extended disk structure surrounding the central , massive body than in model  a64 .",
    "in particular , the properties of this disk , its mass , radial extent , and rotational state , therefore require the use of a proper physical equation of state during the simulations of neutron star merging .",
    "we acknowledge the indication of the possible relevance of the presented comparison by an anonymous referee of the paper of ruffert et al .",
