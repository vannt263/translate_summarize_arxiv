    "cooperative effects occur when the behavior of a many body system is determined by their collective interactions with each other and thus manifest themselves in a large variety of physical systems . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the specific case of a collection of atoms illuminated by a laser .",
    "in this situation , the electro - magnetic field mediates resonant dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms , leading to a cooperative response of the system , which quantitatively differs from the single atom response .",
    "such effects are imprinted on physical observables that can be experimentally measured such as e.g. the emission diagram or the radiation pressure force acting on the cloud .    when a single atom is illuminated by a laser , the scattering process results in a force proportional to the number of scattered photons . indeed , as an atom absorbs a photon from the laser of wave vector @xmath0 , it acquires a momentum @xmath1 , but the average momentum change during the emission process is zero .    for a collection of atoms ,",
    "the picture changes drastically as it was first noticed in a pioneering work by dicke  @xcite where he showed enhanced spontaneous emission decay rates in small and large samples due to constructive interferences of collective emission .",
    "in the situation of an incident laser scattering on a cloud of atoms , the atoms cooperate to scatter the light leading to a directional emission .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the synchronization of the atomic dipoles with the laser .",
    "the collective effects becomes even stronger as the atomic medium becomes optically dense and the radiation of the atoms starts to alter significantly the wave propagation . among the other collective effects that arise",
    ", one can mention the collective lamb shift  @xcite , mie resonances  @xcite , subradiance  @xcite , the refractive index of a dilute bose gas @xcite as well as a reduction of the radiation pressure force  @xcite .",
    "since the radiated light results from the interference of the waves emitted by each dipole , the simple relation between emitted photon and atomic recoil is lost .",
    "for example , a striking feature of cooperativity is the modification of the atomic recoil due to the presence of the neighboring atoms  @xcite , an effect that can not be deduced from single - atom physics .",
    "we here discuss the particular relation between the directional superradiant emission , and the reduction of the radiation pressure force .",
    "the atomic cloud is described as a microscopic ensemble of coupled atomic dipoles , and both the radiated field and the force are expressed as a function of these dipoles .",
    "the optical theorem is derived in this framework , and is shown to lead to a direct relation between intensity scattered and radiation pressure force for the cloud center - of - mass .",
    "the atomic cloud is described as a system of two - level ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) atoms , with resonant frequency @xmath4 and position @xmath5 , that are driven by an uniform laser beam with electric field amplitude @xmath6 , frequency @xmath7 and wave vector @xmath8 .",

    "the third term corresponds to the atoms that returned to the ground state having emitted a photon in the mode @xmath18 , whereas the last one corresponds to the presence of two excited atoms and one virtual photon with ` negative ' energy .",

    ", the average force along the @xmath54-axis reads : @xmath84.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe from eq . that the average radiation pressure force is not merely proportional to the excitation probability , i.e. @xmath85 , but it is the result of an interference between the different atomic dipoles @xmath86 .",
    "for this reason a measurement of the force captures the coherence properties of the scattering process as well as the detection of the light intensity . to make this point more explicit , using eq .",
    ", it is possible to write the force as @xmath87 where the scattered far - field intensity is @xmath88 .",
    "this highlights the fact that the radiation pressure force , that pushes the atoms along the direction of the incident beam , is proportional to the net radiation flux of the scattered intensity .    in the case of an isotropic emission ( e.g. , single - atom case , or cloud much smaller than the wavelength ) , the scattered intensity @xmath89 is independent on the angle and we get @xmath90 : the direct proportionality between scattered power and radiation pressure force is recovered .",
    "the cooperative effect of light scattering in such small samples is then encoded in the total scattered intensity @xmath89 . in the case of superradiant scattering for larger samples , a pronounced emission into the forward direction decreases the radiation force , as observed for example in ref .",
    "in this section we are interested in understanding how the scattering cross section scales with the parameters of the system .",
    "we consider the case of a slab with uniform density distribution .",
    "the slab contains @xmath51 atoms and its size along the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath54 axes is denoted by @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in figure [ cross_section_scaling ] show how the scattering cross section depends on the optical thickness of the cloud @xmath96 .",
    "for dilute clouds of atoms we find :    @xmath97.\\label{fit}\\ ] ]    when the slab is optically thick , i.e. @xmath98 , we observe that the cross section appears to approach @xmath99 .",
    "this factor of two corresponds to the well - known  extinction paradox \" @xcite for which the extinction cross section is twice as large as the one predicted by geometrical optics due to the diffraction contribution .",
    "the residual deviations from the factor of 2 between the scattering and geometrical cross sections might be associated to a still moderate size of our sample @xcite , or to dipole blockade effects  @xcite . for",
    "spherical dielectric spheres , @xmath70 shows an oscillatory behavior around @xmath100 ( @xmath101 for our square geometry ) , which is damped for increasing sizes of the sphere @xcite . when @xmath102 the scattering cross section can be written as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the resonant scattering cross section for a single atom in the scalar wave description ( it differs from the well know cross section for vectorial light @xmath105 ) . in this limit , the interpretation is clear : at low optical thickness the cooperative effects are negligible and the scattering of light is given by the response of @xmath51 independent atoms .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a study of the areal scaling of the light scattering by varying the size of a dense , cold atomic cloud .    before concluding , we would like to underline the importance of the role of diffraction . since we are using a microscopic description of the system , diffraction effects for the scattered field",
    "are already included in our model .",
    "however , free propagation of the incident field needs to be added for a fully consistent description . in this respect ,",
    "the incident plane wave considered so far in the paper is a peculiar case .",
    "we will focus on these aspects in forthcoming studies to precisely understand the role of diffraction .",
    "this will naturally lead us to compare our coherent microscopic model of coupled dipoles to stochastic incoherent models commonly used to describe photon propagation in random media .",
    "understanding coherent light propagation in disordered resonant scatterers is of prime importance for both the atomic physics and the waves in complex media communities .",
    "we here discussed the superradiant emission of a cloud of cold atoms , when the interference of the waves radiated by the atomic dipoles builds up a coherent emission . despite the fact that the simple relation between absorbed photons and radiation pressure force existing in the single - atom case was lost , the optical theorem allowed to recover a simple relation between the total scattered intensity and the displacement of the cloud center - of - mass .",
    "the measure of the force of the center of mass of the atomic cloud contains ( partial ) information on the scattered intensity , even for large values of optical thickness of the cloud . we have computed the total scattering cross section which approaches a value close to twice the geometrical cross section of the sample , in line with the well - know extinction paradox .",
    "finally , understanding the role of diffraction paves the way for further studies to compare our coherent microscopic model to well established stochastic incoherent models describing photon propagation in random media .",
