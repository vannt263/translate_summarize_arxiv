    "exact axial symmetric solutions of einstein field equations are a good starting point for modeling astrophysical applications in general relativity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric . in the last decades",
    ", several exact solutions were studied as possible galactic models .",
    "static thin disk solutions were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite and morgan and morgan @xcite , where they considered disks without radial pressure .",
    "disks with radial pressure and with radial tension have been considered by morgan and morgan @xcite and gonzlez and letelier @xcite , respectively .",
    "self - similar static disks were studied by lynden - bell and pineault @xcite , and lemos @xcite .",
    "moreover , solutions that involve superpositions of black holes with static disks were analyzed by lemos and letelier @xcite and klein @xcite .",
    "also , relativistic counter - rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr type metrics were found by bik and ledvinka @xcite .",
    "counter - rotating models with radial pressure and dust disks without radial pressure were studied by gonzlez and espitia @xcite , and garca and gonzlez @xcite , respectively ; while rotating disks with heat flow were studied by gonzlez and letelier @xcite .",
    "furthermore , static thin disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric @xcite and zipoy - voorhees @xcite metric were obtained by bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite .",
    "also , bik , lynden - bell and pichon @xcite found an infinite number of new static solutions .",
    "stationary disk models including electric fields @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and both electric and magnetic fields @xcite have been studied . in the last years , exact solutions for thin disks made with single and composite halos of matter @xcite , charged dust @xcite and charged perfect fluid @xcite were obtained . for a survey on relativistic gravitating disks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "most of the models constructed above were found using the metric to calculate its energy momentum - tensor , i.e. a inverse problem .",
    "several exact disk solutions were found using the direct method that consists in computing the metric for a given energy momentum tensor representing the disk @xcite . in a first approximation , the galaxies can be thought to be thin , this usually simplifies the analysis and provides very useful information .",
    "but , in order to model real physical galaxies the thickness of the disks must be considered .",
    "exact axially symmetric relativistic thick disks in different coordinate systems were studied by gonzlez and letelier @xcite .",
    "also , different thick disks were obtained from the schwarzschild metric in different coordinates systems with the ",
    "displace , cut , fill , and reflect \" method @xcite .",
    "recently , a relativistic generalization of the miyamoto - nagai potential was obtained @xcite .    the applicability of these disks models to any structure found in nature lays in its stability .",
    "the study of the stability , analytically or numerically , is vital to the acceptance of the particular model . also , the study of different types of perturbations , when applied to these models , might give an insight on the formation of bars , rings or different stellar patterns . furthermore , a perturbation can cause the collapse of a stable object with the posterior appearance of a different kind of structure .",
    "an analytical treatment of the stability of disks in newtonian theory can be found in @xcite and references therein . in general , the stability of disks in general relativity is done in two ways .",
    "one way is to study the stability of the particle orbits along geodesics .",
    "this kind of studied was made by letelier @xcite transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability @xcite into a general relativistic formulation . using this criterion ,",
    "the stability of orbits around black holes surrounded by disks , rings and multipolar fields were analyzed @xcite .",
    "also , this criterion was employed in @xcite to study the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , and thin disks of single and composite halos .",
    "the stability of circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes are studied in @xcite . moreover , the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier solution @xcite for the superposition of a black hole and a flat ring are considered in @xcite .",
    "also , bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite analyzed the stability of several thin disks without radial pressure or tension studying their velocity curves and specific angular momentum .",
    "the other way to study the stability of disks is to perturb its energy momentum tensor .",
    "this way is more complete than the analysis of particle motions along geodesics because we are taking into account the collective behavior of the particles .",
    "however , there are few studies in the literature performing this kind of perturbation .",
    "a general stability study of a relativistic fluid , with both bulk and dynamical viscosity , was done by seguin @xcite .",
    "he considered the coefficients of the perturbed variables as constants , i.e. local perturbations .",
    "usually , this condition is too restrictive .",
    "stability analysis of thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric perturbing their energy momentum tensor with a general first order perturbation were made by ujevic and letelier @xcite , finding that the thin disks without radial pressure are not stable @xcite .    in order to have a general relativistic physical model for galaxies , we must considered , first of all , the thickness of the disk and its stability under perturbations of the fluid quantities . the purpose of this work is to study numerically the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk under a general first order perturbation .",
    "the perturbation is done in the temporal , radial , axial and azimuthal components of the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor of the fluid . in the general thick disk case ,",
    "the perturbed conservation equations are not self - consistent because the number of unknowns is larger than the number of equations . in order to make the system of equation self - consistent",
    "we must chose a combination of the perturbed quantities .",
    "this opens the possibility to perform several types of perturbed quantities combinations that provide a self - consistent set of equations . in this manuscript , we study the physical accepted perturbations . we mean by a physical perturbation the fact that a perturbation in a given direction of the pressure must create a perturbation in the same direction of the four velocity . the energy momentum perturbation considered in this manuscript",
    "is treated as  test matter \" , so it does not modified the background metric obtained from the solution of einstein equations .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the general perturbed conservation equations for the thick disk case .",
    "the energy momentum tensor is considered diagonal with its elements different from zero .",
    "also , the energy momentum perturbation is considered as  test matter \" . in this section",
    "we classified the possible perturbed quantities combinations that leads to a self - consistent set of the perturbed conservation equations of motion . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the thick disk considered for the analysis , i.e. the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk .",
    "the form of its energy density and pressures , as well as , the restrictions that the thermodynamic quantities must obey to satisfy the strong , weak and dominant energy conditions are shown .",
    "later , in sec .",
    "iv , we perform all the physical accepted perturbations to the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk to study its stability . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we summarized our results .",
    "the thick disk considered is a particular case of the general static , axially symmetric metric    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of the variables ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "( our conventions are : @xmath5 .",
    "metric signature + 2 . partial and covariant derivatives with respect to the coordinate @xmath6 denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . )    in its rest frame , the energy momentum tensor of the fluid @xmath9 is diagonal with components ( -@xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is the energy density and ( @xmath12 ) are the radial , azimuthal and axial pressures or tensions , respectively .",
    "so , in this frame of reference , the energy momentum tensor can be written as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the four vectors of the orthonormal tetrad    @xmath18    which satisfy the orthonormal relations .",
    "note that with the above definitions , the timelike four velocity of the fluid is @xmath14 and the quantities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the spacelike principal directions of the fluid .",
    "furthermore , the energy momentum tensor satisfies einstein field equations , @xmath19 .    due to the form of our axially symmetric",
    "metric , the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are functions of the coordinates ( @xmath4 ) only .",
    "let us consider a general perturbation @xmath20 of a quantity @xmath21 in the form    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the unperturbed quantity and @xmath24 is the perturbation . replacing ( [ perturb ] ) for each quantity in the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) and reordering terms",
    ", we obtain that    @xmath25    hereafter , we assume that the perturbed energy momentum tensor does not modify the background metric found by solving the einstein field equation @xmath26 . in other words , the perturbation @xmath27 is treated as a test fluid .",
    "not considering the fluid as a test fluid is a second degree of approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered . with the perturbed energy momentum tensor @xmath28 and einstein field equations",
    ", we obtain that the perturbed energy momentum equations for the problem must obey    @xmath29    these four equations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite from eq .",
    "( 8ii ) to eq .",
    "hereafter , the equations from ref .",
    "@xcite will be denoted by ii . in this manuscript",
    "we are interested in linear perturbations of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "so , in writing the explicit form of the four equations ( [ tmunuperturb ] ) we discard terms of order greater or equal to ( @xmath30 ) . it is explained in @xcite , that if we want a consistent perturbation model the tetrad must be perturbed .",
    "moreover , demanding the orthonormal condition for the perturbed tetrad we find several relations between their components ( 14ii ) .",
    "because of the form of the perturbed energy momentum equation for the axially symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) , the connection coefficients are only functions of the coordinates ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , all the coefficients on the perturbed conservation equations depend only on ( @xmath4 ) and we can construct a general perturbation of the form    @xmath31    hereafter @xmath32 . in this article , we are interested in perturbations of the four velocity @xmath14 and the thermodynamics variables ( @xmath10 ) . for that reason , we see in ( 14ii ) that the @xmath33 components of the tetrad @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 must be perturbed .",
    "moreover , the tetrad perturbations @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not related whatsoever to the four - velocity or the thermodynamic variables perturbations and we can set them equal to zero . with these assumptions , the perturbation ( [ delta ] ) and conditions ( 14ii ) , the general perturbed energy momentum equations ( 8ii)-(13ii ) can be cast into the particular form    @xmath40 @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta u^\\theta [ i k_\\theta ( \\rho u^t + \\xi_2 p_\\theta   y^\\theta ) ] + \\delta u^z [ { \\rm f}(t , z,\\rho u^t ) + \\xi_{3,z } p_z z^z +   \\xi_3 { \\rm f}(t , z , p_z",

    ", there is another important conservation equation , the equation of continuity ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the proper number density of particles .",
    "the proper number density of particles @xmath52 , and the total energy density @xmath11 are related through the relation ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the constant mean baryon mass and @xmath55 the internal energy density .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ varepsilon ] ) by @xmath14 , performing the covariant derivative ( @xmath8 ) and using eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) , we obtain that    @xmath56    now , from the relation @xmath57 and the energy momentum tensor ( [ tmunu ] ) , we obtain and expression for @xmath58 . substituting this last expression into eq .",
    "( [ rhovar ] ) we finally arrive at    @xmath59    which is a first order differential equation for @xmath55 . therefore , with @xmath55 given by ( [ pdevar ] ) the equation of continuity ( [ continuity ] ) is satisfied .",
    "for this reason , the continuity equation can be omitted for our stability analysis because , in principle , we can always find a solution for @xmath55 .",
    "hereafter , the contribution of @xmath60 and @xmath55 to the total energy density are consider in @xmath11 . in the case",
    "when the internal energy density of the fluid is given , the equation of continuity must be considered . in other words ,",
    "the knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of the disk is important for actual applications .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system can be obtained from observations or theoretically from the fokker - planck equation , where we obtain the particle distribution function of the disk .",
    "solving the fokker - planck equation is not an easy task , but some progress in newtonian gravity have been done @xcite .",
    "the four equations ( [ t]-[z ] ) contain seven independent unknowns , say @xmath61 .",
    "so , at this point , the number of unknowns are greater than the number of equations and the system is not self - consistent .",
    "this opens the possibility to perform different kind of perturbations to make the system self - consistent . in table",
    "[ options ] we present the classification for all the possible perturbations that lead to a self - consistent system of equations .",
    "we divided the table in three sections that depend on the number of perturbed quantities , i.e. two , three and four quantities perturbations .",
    "equation ( [ theta ] ) is important for this classification because it only involve the two unknowns ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "therefore , if one of them is , by construction , equal to zero then the other unknown is also zero .",
    "there is a possibility to avoid the other unknown to be equal zero , i.e. if the unknown coefficient is equal zero .",
    "this situation can occur in particular space - time points .",
    "we do not consider these cases .",
    "the system of equations for the different combinations of the perturbed quantities reduce to various differential equations , the form of the particular differential equation is written in the column differential equation .",
    "we denote by ode # and pde # an ordinary different equation of order # and a partial differential equation of order # , respectively . the differential equation marked with a question mark ( ? ) means that other four perturbations , that do not include the @xmath63 and @xmath64 perturbations , are not self - consistent , but they might be if we assume other imposed conditions for the involve quantities , as for example @xmath65 . moreover , if we assume other imposed conditions for the different types of perturbation shown in table [ options ] , the differential equation classification may change .",
    "we are interested in consistent physical perturbations .",
    "for that reason we search for perturbations in which the velocity perturbation in a certain direction leads to a pressure perturbation in the same direction .",

    "note that the starting point of the sudden variation of the axial velocity perturbation coincides with the radius in which the axial pressure perturbation exceeds the 10% value profile of @xmath130 . also , in fig .",
    "[ figsib ] , we see that the azimuthal pressure perturbations and the azimuthal velocity perturbations for different modes are stable . in the case of the azimuthal pressure , we have not included the 10% profile because is three order of magnitude higher than the perturbation value .",

    "we see that when we increase the value of the parameter @xmath145 , the velocity perturbations are more stable ( if we neglect the region near the edge of the disk at @xmath140 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the frequency @xmath107 only enters the equation for @xmath67 like a scale factor .",
    "we have performed the same above analysis for different values of the parameter @xmath100 , and we found that the qualitative behavior is the same . with these results",
    "we can say , if we neglect the region near the edge of the disk at @xmath140 , that the isotropic thick disk is always stable for higher values of the parameter @xmath107 and has some stable modes for lower values of @xmath107 .",

    "@xmath107 the modes are stable . even for the most stable mode",
    "there is a abruptly increase in the amplitude profile at the edge of the disk .",
    "this change in the behavior occurs very near @xmath140 and can not be seen in the axial velocity perturbation graph . in this case",
    "we can say that the mode with @xmath145 is not stable . if we compare the axial velocity perturbation graph of fig .",

    "we performed the above analysis for different values of the parameter @xmath100 and we found that the quantities involve have the same qualitative behavior .",
    "similar to sec .",
    "iv - b , some modes corresponding to lower values of the frequency @xmath107 are not stable . as we note in fig .",

    "more complex structures may be form , but in order to study them , we need a higher order perturbation formalism .",
    "in this subsection we perturb the radial component of the four velocity , the axial component of the four velocity , the radial pressure and the axial pressure .",
    "this kind of perturbation belongs to the ones marked with a question mark in table [ options ] . as we said in sec .",
    "ii , we need an extra condition to make the set of equations self - consistent . in this case",
    ", we set @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the set of equations ( [ t])-([z ] ) reduce to a second order partial differential equation for the pressure perturbation @xmath148 , say    @xmath149    where ( @xmath150 ) are functions of ( @xmath151 ) , see appendix [ fsie ] . the partial differential equation ( [ pde2sie ] )",
    "is solved numerically with four boundary conditions , at @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath108 and @xmath154 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath66 can not be set at 1 because some quantities diverge . as we said in sec .",
    "iv - b , this is due to the geometrical restrictions that has the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk .",
    "they are different ways in which we can set the boundary conditions in order to simulate various kinds of pressure perturbations . here",
    ", we treat only the case when we have a pressure perturbation at @xmath108 and along the @xmath66 axis , i.e. some kind of a rod perturbation .",
    "we set the value of the rod pressure perturbation to be 10% of the axial pressure . for the rest of the boundary conditions we set the values equal to zero because we want the perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk .",
    "we chose the 10% of the value of the axial pressure instead of the radial pressure because it has the lowest value near @xmath108 . in that way , the perturbation values are also below the 10% values of the radial pressure and the general linear perturbation is valid .    in fig .",
    "[ figsie ] , we present the perturbation amplitude for the pressure , the physical radial velocity and the physical axial velocity for @xmath145 .",
    "we see in the pressure perturbation graph that the perturbation rapidly decays to values near zero when we move out from the center of the disk . in the velocity perturbations profiles we can see an interesting phenomenon .",
    "note that in the lower domain of the disk [ -1,0 ) the axial velocity perturbation is positive and in the upper domain ( 0,1 ] the axial velocity perturbation is negative .",
    "this means that due to the linear perturbation the disk tries to collapse to the plane @xmath113 .",
    "now , if we look to the radial velocity perturbation graph , we note that the upper and lower parts depart from the center of the disk due to the positive radial perturbation .",
    "the center of the disk tries to condensate .",
    "so , with these considerations , we may say that the disk tends to form some kind of a ring around the center of the disk .",
    "this phenomenon appears near the center of the disk in a few units of @xmath100 .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 enters only like a scale factor in the differential equations quantities studied .",
    "in this manuscript we obtain the basic perturbation equations for studying the stability of thick disks .",
    "these equations were obtained when we applied a general first order perturbation to the conservation equations of motion .",
    "the great number of unknowns make the set of equations not self - consistent . in order to make the system of equations self - consistent",
    "we must chose a combination of the perturbed quantities .",
    "this opens the possibility for various types of combinations . in this manuscript we made a classification of these possibilities and studied the physical accepted perturbations .",
    "we can say , that the stability analysis we performed is more complete than the stability analysis of particle motion along geodesics because we take into account the collective behavior of the particles .",
    "however , this analysis can be said to be incomplete because the energy momentum perturbation tensor of the fluid is treated as a test fluid and does not alter the background metric .",
    "this is a second degree of approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered .",
    "the stability analyses made to the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk , show that this disk is stable when we applied radial and azimuthal perturbations . in the case of axial perturbations ,",
    "the nodes are not stable near the edge of the disk .",
    "the lack of stability is due to the form of the geometric thick disk considered @xcite , i.e. it is only valid in a fixed axial interval @xmath155 , where @xmath88 is a constant ( in our case @xmath88=1 ) .",
    "if we discard the region near the axial edge we can say , in general , that for higher values of the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath114 the axial modes are also stable . for lower values of @xmath107 ,",
    "some axial perturbations are not stable .",
    "this is related to the fact that our first order perturbation is not valid in some regions of the considered quantities . in these cases ,",
