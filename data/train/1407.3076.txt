    "in ultracold fermi gases , we can systematically study various many - body phenomena@xcite .",
    "for example , a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance enables us to examine superfluid properties from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit@xcite .",
    "another example is that , using an optical lattice , we can tune the dimensionality of the system@xcite . using the former advantage ,",
    "the bcs - bec crossover has been realized in @xmath2k@xcite and @xmath3li@xcite fermi gases .",
    "using the latter , a two - dimensional fermi gas has recently been realized@xcite .",
    "in contrast to a three - dimensional fermi gas , the bcs - type superfluid phase transition is prohibited by strong pairing fluctuations in the two - dimensional case@xcite .",
    "however , berezinskii@xcite , kosterlitz and thouless ( bkt)@xcite clarified that a two - dimensional system may have a quasi - long - range order , exhibiting superfluidity . in cold atom physics , the bkt transition has recently been realized in a @xmath4rb bose gas , loaded on a two - dimensional optical lattice@xcite .",
    "the bkt transition in a fermi gas is a crucial next challenge .",
    "since the bkt transition occurs under the situation that the bcs long - range - order is completely suppressed by strong two - dimensional pairing fluctuations , physical properties near the bkt instability would be also affected by these fluctuations .",
    "in addition , in the three - dimensional bcs state , the superfluid order parameter @xmath5 is directly related to the single - particle excitation gap .",
    "since the pair formation also occurs in the fermionic bkt state , it is an interesting problem how the energy gap in the bkt phase is described without the gap parameter @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the single - particle density of states @xmath0 in a two - dimensional fermi gas . within a gaussian fluctuation theory@xcite",
    ", we examine how pairing fluctuations affect this quantity . in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "they are known to cause the pseudogap phenomenon@xcite , which is characterized by a dip structure in @xmath0 around @xmath6 .",
    "we show that this many - body phenomenon also occurs in the two - dimensional case , where the pseudogapped density of states near @xmath1 is very similar to the bcs superfluid density of states .",

    "we recall that , although we have introduced the saddle point solution @xmath57 in calculating @xmath1 , this mean - field order parameter is _ not _ used in @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "thus , the gap - like structure in fig . [ fig2](a ) is the pseudogap associated with pairing fluctuations . since the low - dimensionality enhances pairing fluctuations , the pseudogap in the present case is more remarkable than the three - dimensional case@xcite .    when @xmath75 , the pseudogap structure at @xmath1 is very similar to the bcs superfluid density of states with sharp coherence peaks at the gap edges ( see the right inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",

    "( [ eq14c ] ) , which describes fluctuations in the cooper channel , would be large when @xmath77 near @xmath1 . using this , when we approximate eq .",
    "( [ eq14c ] ) to @xmath78 , the green s function @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is found to have the same form as the ordinary particle component of the bcs green s function as , @xmath80 this means that the so - called pseudogap parameter @xmath81@xcite plays similar roles to the bcs superfluid order parameter @xmath57 , leading to the pseudogap with sharp ` coherence ' peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "thus , when one measures @xmath0 near @xmath1 , the system would look like the mean - field bcs state , although the superfluid order parameter @xmath5 is actually absent and strong pairing fluctuations only exist .",
    "while the pseudogap structure is similar to the bcs density of states at @xmath1 , their temperature dependence is very different from each other . in the bcs state ,",
    "when the temperature increases , the gap width gradually becomes small , keeping the sharp coherence peaks at the gap edges , in contrast , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows that the pseudogap structure , as well as the sharp peaks , gradually become obscure with increasing the temperature .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed strong - coupling properties of a two - dimensional ultracold fermi gas . including pairing fluctuations within the framework of a gaussian fluctuation theory , we calculated the single - particle density of states @xmath0 near the bkt phase transition . at @xmath1 , pairing fluctuations induce a pseudogap in @xmath0 , the structure of which is very similar to the bcs superfluid density of states with a finite excitation gap , as well as sharp coherence peaks at the gap edges .",
    "that is , the bcs - like energy gap is expected to be observed even in a two - dimensional fermi gas near @xmath1 , although the superfluid order parameter is absent and the system is dominated by low - dimensional pairing fluctuations . since the achievement of the bkt phase transition is an exciting challenge in cold fermi gas physics , our results would be useful for the study of this superfluid state on the view point of single - particle excitations .",
