    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) have long been considered to be inert stellar systems , essentially devoid of gas and dust . however , this view has radically changed since a number of imaging and spectroscopy studies from both the ground and space have revealed the presence of a multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) : a hot ( @xmath3 k ) , x - ray emitting halo @xcite ; a warm ( @xmath4 k ) component ( often referred to as `` ionized gas '' ) @xcite ; and even cooler components detected in the mir @xcite and in hi and co @xcite .",
    "ionized gas is detected in 40 - 80 % of early - type galaxies via its optical emission lines @xcite .    despite the number of studies ,",
    "several issues remain still open .",
    "the first question is the origin of the ism in etgs .",
    "evidence for external acquisition comes from narrow - band imaging studies , often showing gas / star misalignment @xcite , and from kinematical studies , often showing gas / star angular momentum decoupling @xcite .",
    "the second still open issue concerns the ionizing source of the warm gas .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies show that etgs are typically classified as low - ionization emission - line regions ( liners ) according to their emission line ratios @xcite . however , there is still strong debate about the ionization mechanism in liners .",
    "actually , the most viable excitation mechanisms are : low accretion - rate agn @xcite , photoionization by old post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars @xcite , fast shocks @xcite .",
    "with the aim of understanding the nature of ionized gas in etgs , we acquired intermediate - resolution ( fwhm @xmath57.6    at 5550   ) optical spectra ( 3700 - 7250  ) for a sample of 65 nearby e / s0 galaxies . for a detailed description of the sample",
    "we refer to @xcite ( paper  i ) and @xcite ( paper  ii ) . for the derivation of ages , metallicities , and [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios",
    ", we refer to @xcite ( paper  iii ) . here",
    "we recall that the sample was selected from a compilation of galaxies showing ism traces in at least one of the following bands : iras 100 @xmath6 m , x - ray , radio , hi and co @xcite . because of the selection criteria , the sample is biased toward the presence of emission lines .",
    "the galaxies are mainly located in low density environments . in the present study",
    ", we will use the spectra extracted in 4 annuli of increasing galacto - centric distance ( 0 @xmath7 r @xmath7r@xmath8/16 , r@xmath9/16 @xmath7 r @xmath7r@xmath8/8 , r@xmath9/8 @xmath7 r @xmath7r@xmath8/4 , and r@xmath9/4 @xmath7 r @xmath7r@xmath8/2 ) .",
    "the emission line fluxes were measured on residual spectra obtained by subtracting the stellar population contribution to the observed galaxy spectra . to this purpose , we used new ssps ( bressan , unpublished ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ssps were computed from the isochrones of @xcite , with the revision of @xcite including a new agb mass - loss treatment . in the optical domain ,",
    "the ssps are based on the miles spectral library @xcite .",
    "the galaxy continua were fitted with the new ssps , smoothed to match the instrumental resolution and the galaxy velocity dispersion , through a @xmath10 criterion . in the fit , we considered selected spectral regions chosen to include both features particularly sensitive to age ( the relative strength of the ca ii h + k lines , the 4000   break , the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 lines ) , and features more sensitive to metallicity ( the fe lines at @xmath1 4383 , 4531 , 5270 , 5335 , and the mg absorption features around @xmath1 5175 ) .",
    "the residual spectrum around each line was derived by normalizing the ssp in two continuum bands adjacent to the line of interest .",
    "the line fluxes were determined by fitting the residual spectrum with gaussian curves of variable width and intensity . as an example , we show the stellar continuum subtraction and the line fit for ic  1459 in fig .",
    "the emission lines were corrected for extinction through the observed @xmath13 flux ratio , assuming an intrinsic value of @xmath5 3.1 valid for agn - like objects ( osterbrock 1989 ) . some galaxies in the sample present very large reddening , up to @xmath14 or even more . since the observed continuum is incompatible with such large values , the dust must be patchy .",
    "emission lines are detected in 58 out of 65 galaxies ( @xmath0 89 % of the sample ) .",
    "the incidence of emission appears independent from the e and s0 morphological classes .",
    "the nebular emission is stronger in the galaxy center , and decreases moving toward the more external annuli .",
    "galaxies were classified through the standard [ oiii]@xmath15007/ h@xmath15 versus [ nii]@xmath16583/ h@xmath2 diagnostic diagram , first proposed by @xcite ( hereafter bpt ) . the bpt diagram for our galaxy sample , in the 4 annuli ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the majority of galaxies are classified as liners . only ic  5063 is classified as a _ bona fide _ seyfert galaxy .",
    "a few galaxies , namely ngc  3489 , ngc  3818 , ngc  3136 , ngc  6776 , ngc  7007 , ngc  777 , and ngc  6958 , fall in the seyfert region , but are consistent with a liner classification within the errors . some galaxies ( ngc  3258 , ngc  4552 , ngc  5193 , ngc  5328 , ngc  6721 , ngc  6876 , ic  2006 ) fall in the `` composites '' region ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and possibly contain a combined contribution from both star formation and agn .",
    "we notice that , from the center outwards , the bulk of the galaxies move left - down in the bpt diagram .",
    "an increasing number of galaxies pass from liners to `` composite '' objects as the emission lines are measured at larger galacto - centric distances .",
    "this suggests that different ionization mechanisms may be at work in liners ."
