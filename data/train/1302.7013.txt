    "alzheimer s disease ( ad ) is acknowledged as one of the most widespread diseases of age - related dementia with @xmath1 35.6 million people infected worldwide ( world alzheimer report 2010 @xcite ) . by the 2050 s ,",
    "this same report has predicted three or four times more people living with ad .",
    "ad affects memory , cognizance , behavior , and eventually leads to death .",
    "apart from the social dysfunction of patients , another notable societal consequence of ad is its economic cost ( @xmath1 $ 422 billion in 2009 @xcite ) .",
    "the human and social impact of ad has driven extensive research to understand its causes and to develop effective therapies . among recent findings are the results that imply cellular prion protein ( ) is connected to memory impairment @xcite .",
    "this connection is the focus of our modeling here , which we hope will contribute to understanding the relation of ad to prions .",
    "the pathogenesis of ad is related to a gradual build - up of ( ) plaques in the brain @xcite .",
    "plaques are formed from the  peptides obtained from the amyloid protein precursor ( app ) protein cleaved at a displaced position .",
    "there exist different forms of , from soluble monomers to insoluble fibrillar aggregates @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed that the toxicity depends on the size of these structures and recent evidence suggest that oligomers ( small aggregates ) play a key role in memory impairment rather than  plaques ( larger aggregates ) formed in the brain @xcite .",
    "more specifically ,  oligomers cause memory impairment _ via _ synaptic toxicity onto neurons .",
    "this phenomenon seems to be induced by a membrane receptor , and there is evidence that this rogue agent is the protein @xcite we note that this protein , when misfolded in a pathological form called , is responsible for creutzfeldt - jacob disease .",
    "indeed , it is believed that there is a high affinity between and  oligomers , at least theoretically @xcite .",
    "moreover , the prion protein has also been identified as an app regulator , which confirms that both are highly related @xcite .",
    "this discovery offers a new therapeutic target to recover memory in ad patients , or at least slow memory depletion @xcite .",
    "our objective here is to introduce and study a new _ in vivo _ model of ad evolution mediated by proteins . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no model such as the one proposed here , has yet been advanced . there",
    "exist a variety of models specifically designed for alzheimer s disease and their treatment , such as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the prion protein has never been taken into account in the way we formulate here , and our model could helpful in designing new experiments and treatments ..    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the model in section [ sec : themodel ] , and provide a well - posedness result in the particular case that are formed at a constant rate . in section [ power ]",
    "we provide a theoretical study of our model in a more general context with a power law rate of polymerization , _",
    "i.e. _ the polymerization or build - up rate depends on  plaque size .",
    "the model deals with four different species .",
    "first , the concentration of  oligomers consisting of aggregates of a few  peptides ; second , the concentration of the  protein ; third , the concentration of the complex formed from one  oligomer binding onto one  protein .",
    "these quantities are soluble and their concentration will be described in terms of ordinary differential equations .",
    "fourth , we have the insoluble  plaques described by a density according to their size @xmath2 .",
    "this approach is standard in modeling prion proliferation phenomena ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "note that the size @xmath2 is an abstract variable that could be the volume of the aggregate . here , however , we view aggregates as fibrils that lengthen in one dimension .",
    "the size variable @xmath2 thus belongs to the interval @xmath3 , where @xmath4 stands for a critical size below which the plaques can not form . to summarize we denote , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,    * @xmath7 : the density of  plaques of size @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , * @xmath10 : the concentration of soluble  oligomers ( unbounded oligomers ) at time @xmath11 , * @xmath12 : the concentration of soluble cellular prion proteins  at time @xmath9 , * @xmath13 : the concentration of -@xmath0-complex ( bounded oligomers ) at time @xmath9 .",
    "note that  plaques are formed from the clustering of  oligomers .",
    "the rate of agglomeration depends on the concentration of soluble oligomers and the structure of the amyloid which is linked to its size .",
    "it occurs in a mass action between plaques and oligomers at a nonnegative rate given by @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is the size of the plaque .",
    "this is the reason why the intentionally misused word `` size '' considered here ( and described above ) accounts for the mass of  oligomers that form the polymer .",
    "we assume indeed , that the mass of one oligomer is given by a `` sufficiently small '' parameter @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the number of oligomers in a plaque of mass @xmath16 is @xmath17 which justifies our assumption that the size of plaques is a continuum .",
    "moreover , amyloids have a critical size @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of oligomers in the critical plaque size .",
    "the amyloids are prone to be damaged at a nonnegative rate @xmath20 , possibly dependent on the size @xmath2 of the plaques .",
    "all the parameters for  oligomers , , and  plaques , such as production , binding and degradation rates , are nonnegative and described in table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "then , writing evolution equations for these four quantities , we obtain @xmath21 = -\\mu(x)f(x , t ) \\quad \\text{on }   ( x_0,+\\infty)\\times(0,+\\infty ) , \\label{eq : seq1 } \\vphantom{\\int_{x_0}^{+\\infty}}\\\\ & \\dot{u } = \\lambda_u - \\gamma_u u -\\tau u p + \\sigma b - n n(u ) - \\frac 1 \\varepsilon u \\int_{x_0}^{+\\infty } \\rho(x ) f(x , t ) d x \\quad \\text{on }   ( 0,+\\infty ) , \\label{eq : seq2 } \\vphantom{\\int_{x_0}^{+\\infty } }   \\\\ & \\dot{p } = \\lambda_p - \\gamma_p p -\\tau u p + \\sigma b \\quad \\text{on }   ( 0,+\\infty ) , \\label{eq : seq3 } \\vphantom{\\int_{x_0}^{+\\infty}}\\\\ & \\dot{b } = \\tau u p - ( \\sigma + \\delta ) b \\quad \\text{on }   ( 0,+\\infty ) .",
    "\\label{eq : seq4 } \\vphantom{\\int_{x_0}^{+\\infty}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath22 accounts for the formation rate of a new plaque with size @xmath23 from the  oligomers .",
    "in order to balance this term , we add the boundary condition @xmath24 the integral in the right - hand side of equation is the total polymerization with parameters@xmath25 , since @xmath26 counts the number of oligomers into a unit of length @xmath27 . finally , the problem is completed with nonnegative initial data , a function @xmath28 and @xmath29 , such that at time @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32    the above system ( [ eq : seq1]-[eq : boundary ] ) involves two formal balance laws : the first one for prion proteins @xmath33 and the second for  oligomers @xmath34 the total concentrations of both evolve in time according to the production and degradation rates . in figure [ figure1 ]",
    "we give a schematic representation of these processes .",
    ".parameter description of the model .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : parameter ]      in this section we investigate constant polymerization and degradation rates , _",
    "i.e _ , rates independent of the size of the plaque involved in the process .",
    "this first approach is biologically less realistic , but technically more tractable , yet still quite challenging for an analytical study of the problem . in section [ power ] , the polymerization rate @xmath36 will be taken more realistically as a power of @xmath2 . here",
    "we assume that @xmath37 are positive constants .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality , we let @xmath38 , which only requires a rescaling of the units in the equations .",
    "then , we assume a pre - equilibrium hypothesis for the formation of plaques , as formulated in @xcite for filaments , by setting @xmath39 .",
    "the formation rate is given by @xmath40 and the number of oligomers necessary to form a new plaque is an integer , @xmath41 . with these assumptions we are able to close the system ( [ eq : seq1]-[eq : seq4 ] ) with respect to into a system of four differential equations . indeed , integrating over @xmath42 we get formally an equation over the quantity of amyloids at time @xmath43 @xmath44 this method has already been used on the prion model in @xcite .",
    "now the problem reads , for @xmath43 , @xmath45 the mass of plaques is given by @xmath46 which satisfies an equation ( formal integration of ) that can be solved independently , since @xmath47 notice that initial conditions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while the initial conditions for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are unchanged .",
    "the next subsection is devoted to the analysis of the system ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) .",
    "we prove in the following proposition the positivity , existence , and uniqueness of a global solution to the system ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) with classical techniques from the theory of ordinary differential equations(@xcite ) .",

    "for any @xmath63 there exists a unique nonnegative bounded solution @xmath64 to the system ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) defined for all time @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e _ , the solution @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 belong to @xmath66 and remains in the stable subset @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . furthermore , let @xmath70 , and then there exist a unique nonnegative solution @xmath49 to , defined for all time @xmath65 .",

    "thus , the system is quasi - positive and the solution remains in @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we remark that @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and gronwall s lemma ensures that @xmath89 this proves the global existence of a unique nonnegative bounded solution @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "the claim for the mass @xmath49 is straightforward .",
    "we next consider the existence of a steady state @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the asymptotic behavior of solutions to ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to compute the steady state by solving the problem @xmath96 from the structure of the second equation , we can not give an explicit formula for this problem . to obtain @xmath93 we have to solve an algebraic equation , which involves a polynomial of degree @xmath97 .",
    "however , we can prove that the solution exists , and then @xmath93 is given implicitly .",

    "moreover it satisfies @xmath110 then , according to the routh - hurwitz criterion ( see @xcite*th .",
    "4.4 , page 150 ) , all the roots of the characterisic polynomial @xmath111 are negative or have negative real part , thus the equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable .    to go further , we give a conditional global stability result when no nucleation is considered , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath112 .",

    "under the condition @xmath114 the unique equilibrium is given by @xmath115 where @xmath93 is the unique positive root of @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .",
    "further , this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable in the stable subset @xmath118 defined in .    the proof is given by a lyapunov function @xmath119 stated in the appendix . it is positive when the condition above is fulfilled and its derivative along the solution to the system ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) is negative definite .",
    "thus , from the lasalle s invariance principle , we get that under these hypotheses the equilibrium of ( [ eq : edo1]-[eq : edo4 ] ) is globally asymptotically stable .",

    "we will see that we are able to obtain a result of existence and uniqueness of solutions for this more general case .",
