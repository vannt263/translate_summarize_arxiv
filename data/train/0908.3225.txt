    "as nuclei start to  feel \" each other at a high density reaching up to @xmath22 , the stiffness of nuclear matter adjusts the polytropic index @xmath20 to @xmath23 .",

    "one important difference between gw and yahil ( 1983 ) is that solutions of the former have outer boundaries with zero mass density there while those of the latter extend to infinity ( lou & cao 2008 ) .    with a similarity transformation ( fatuzzo et al . 2004 ) , lou & cao ( 2008 ) extended homologous core collapse to general polytropic cases",

    "no significant core instabilities were reported for the core - collapse phase .",
    "linear stability analyses were performed by gw , lai ( 2000 ) and lai & goldreich ( 2000 ) for certain dynamic flows .",

    "lai & goldreich ( 2000 ) studied the stability of collapsing core and claimed that the core remains stable in subsonic regions while the envelope becomes unstable in supersonic regions .",
    "all these stable core statements relies on the assumption of a conventional polytropic eos .",
    "conventional polytropic gas flows and perturbations correspond to a constant specific entropy and make g@xmath1modes just neutral convective modes .",
    "our main theme is to examine stability properties of a stellar core collapse with a variable specific entropy distribution in a homologously collapsing model ( lou & cao 2008 ) . by numerical explorations ,",

    "the most interesting result is that some stable g@xmath1modes in the static case become unstable in the dynamically collapsing stage . in particular",
    ", the stability of each mode now becomes sensitive to the self - similar evolution of specific entropy .",
    "this instability occurs during the core - collapse phase , neither before the core collapse nor after the core bounce .",

    "this mode is closely related to the so - called lamb waves ( lamb 1932 ; lou 1990 , 1991 ) which propagate in the horizontal direction and vanish in the vertical direction .",
    "these f@xmath1modes may also be regarded as the lowest - order p@xmath1modes    more specifically , g@xmath1modes can be further divided into two kinds , namely g@xmath2modes and g@xmath3modes ( reading g@xmath1plus modes and g@xmath1minus modes , respectively ) , according to whether the eigenvalue @xmath116 is less or greater than zero . for global 3d perturbations in static stars , the former class of modes is stable while the latter class is unstable ; the stability property of these modes ( especially the g@xmath2modes ) is modified in background dynamic collapses as discussed presently .",
    "the existence of such two classes of g@xmath1modes depend on the square of the so - called brunt - v@xmath5is@xmath5l@xmath5 buoyancy frequency @xmath141 , defined explicitly by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration and @xmath20 is the polytropic index of perturbations .",
    "if @xmath6 is positive everywhere , eigenvalues of @xmath116 are always negative and only g@xmath2modes occur .",
    "if @xmath6 is negative everywhere , eigenvalues of @xmath116 are always positive and only unstable g@xmath3modes occur .",
    "if @xmath6 is positive in a certain part of the system and negative in another part , both types of g@xmath1modes may occur ( e.g. lebovitz 1965a , b , 1966 and cox 1976 for stability properties of oscillations in static stars ) .",
    "note that the gravitational acceleration always points towards the centre of the gas sphere ( i.e. @xmath144 by our notation ) .",
    "therefore , the sign of @xmath6 is determined by the expression in the parenthesis of definition ( [ bvfreq ] ) . in fact",
    ", if the sign of the expression in the parenthesis is negative , this region satisfies the schwarzschild criterion for convective instability ( e.g. lebovitz 1965a ) .",
    "hence , the g@xmath3modes represent convectively unstable modes . in the simplest interpretation",
    ", @xmath141 is the buoyancy frequency associated with a perturbed parcel of fluid in a convectively stable medium .",
    "moreover , scuflaire ( 1974 ) concluded for oscillations in static stars that eigenfunctions of g@xmath3modes can be oscillatory only in convectively unstable region ( i.e. @xmath145 ) . on the other hand , eigenfunctions of g@xmath2modes",
    "can be oscillatory only in radiative region ( i.e. @xmath146 ) .",
    "we found similar features for perturbations in a homologously collapsing stellar core by our extensive numerical explorations .    cowling ( 1941 ) showed and we readily confirm by definition ( [ bvfreq ] ) that for a conventional polytropic eos @xmath147 with @xmath26 being constant for both dynamic core collapse and perturbations , the g@xmath1modes are simply neutrally stable convective modes with @xmath148 as noted by gw .",
    "for this reason , gw investigated stability properties of acoustic p@xmath1modes and suppressed vorticity perturbations in their model analysis by introducing a stream function for velocity perturbation .",
    "we note in passing that the situation with two different polytropic indices for core collapse and perturbations deserves a further investigation .",
    "in contrast , our general polytropic eos allows fairly free options of specific entropy evolution along streamlines so that different @xmath66 gives different profiles of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , g@xmath1modes can occur in a homologously collapsing stellar core and can modify the convective instability criterion of such a dynamic core collapse in a non - trivial manner .",

    "this verification confirms the validity of our numerical method . for double check ,",
    "the runge - kutta shooting method is also applied ( i.e. starting numerical integrations near both ends towards the centre ) to verify the eigenvalues and eigensolutions for perturbations .",
    "more specifically , this perturbation problem involves undesirable diverging solutions towards both ends .",
    "we use the numerical results obtained from the matrix inverse iteration method at two respective points sufficiently close both ends and integrate towards each other to meet at a mid - point .",
    "this avoids the numerical difficulty of diverging solutions towards both ends at @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "given a specified profile of @xmath66 for the specific entropy distribution with @xmath152 at @xmath150 and a perturbation degree @xmath139 value , numerical computations for 3d general polytropic perturbations lead to families of eigenvalue @xmath153 curves .",
    "one important feature for these curves as revealed by our numerical explorations is that none of these families of eigenvalue curves intersects with the @xmath154 line , i.e. each eigenvalue branch @xmath153 remains either above or below @xmath154 line .",

    "1995 , 1996 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) might suggest that specific entropy increases with increasing radius , as grossly described by an increasing type of @xmath66 .",
    "bruenn ( 1985 ) displayed an increasing distribution of entropy versus the enclosed mass .",
    "as the enclosed mass always increases with radius , the specific entropy then ascends with increasing radius .",
    "more evidence comes from simulations for the evolution after the core bounce .",
    "several models illustrate the increasing trend of specific entropy distribution with radius just after the core bounce ( e.g. janka et al . 1995 , 1996 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) .",
    "if the entropy distribution varies not very much through the core bounce , then the specific entropy distribution might also be an increasing function in the core collapse stage , corresponding to an increasing trend of @xmath66 versus @xmath70 .    in short , the analysis of bethe et al .",
    "( 1979 ) indicates that entropy can vary in the core collapse phase while other numerical simulations ( e.g. bruenn 1985 , 1989a , b ; janka & m@xmath205ller 1995 , 1996 ; burrows et al .",
    "2006 , 2007b ) suggested an increasing distribution of entropy during the phase of rebound shock .",
    "therefore , the overall distribution of entropy might be assumed to increase with radius .",
    "having said this , the possibility can not be ruled out that in parts of regions the entropy may decrease with radius locally .",
    "bruenn ( 1985 ) pointed out that entropy decreases with density for mass density @xmath206 .",
    "a turning point @xmath207 appears here , above which the entropy increases with density .",
    "the reason is that at a certain nuclear density , the energy level of @xmath208 neutron shell in the nuclei becomes filled and the electron capture by nuclei is no longer allowed ( e.g. fuller et al .",

    "it should be emphasized that numerical simulations so far have not shown drastic growths of unstable convective modes found here .",

    "neutronization and electron capture , fluctuations in the specific entropy during the core - collapse phase is inevitable ; in particular , such unstable g@xmath1modes , i.e. convective instabilities destroy the spherical symmetry of a collapsing core before the emergence of a rebound shock .",

    "( ii ) such instabilities are expected to distort the shape of a rebound shock front .",
    "compared with current numerical simulations , in which a rebound shock front is initially spherical , then becomes non - spherical and bends towards a particular direction where gas is driven out , our proposed non - spherical shock front at the beginning might give rise to considerable differences for these numerical simulations .",
    "there are several conjectures if our proposed instabilities play a major role in sn explosions .",
    "the @xmath7 g@xmath1mode instability may give rise to kicks of proto - neutron stars . the @xmath8 instability may split the central massive core apart and implies a possible formation of binary pulsars ; by adjusting the parameters in our model , we can have low - order @xmath8 g@xmath1mode instability in a central core whose enclosed mass is @xmath250 .",
    "high - order and high - degree g@xmath1mode instabilities always have a tendency to tear a central core into pieces . as a consequence ,",
    "even though core collapse occurs during which neutronization is triggered and energetic neutrinos burst out , the outgoing rebound shock may leave behind a collection of broken clumps .",
    "we suggest this possibility because in observations no central compact object is found in some sn remnants , including sn1987a ( chevalier 1992 ; manchester 2007 ; mccray 2009 private communications ) . one important prediction of our proposed unstable g@xmath1mode convective instabilities before and during the rebound shock emergence is the resulting turbulent mixing of heavier elements in the inner layers of the core for sne .",
    "according to the evolution theory of massive stars ( e.g. nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) , different heavy elements ( e.g. fe , si , o , c etc . ) lie in ordered core layers from inside out . without convective instabilities occurring before the emergence of a rebound shock , these elemental layers should be more or less kept during a sn explosion .",

    "( 2006 , 2007a , b ) may have well originated from our @xmath7 g@xmath2 and g@xmath3modes during the stellar core collapse phase before the core bounce .",
    "nonlinear evolution of diverse initial fluctuations in various stellar core collapse conditions is expected to give rise to a diversity of possible outcomes for remnant cores of sne .",
    "we have systematically investigated physical properties of 3d perturbations in a hydrodynamic background of self - similar core collapse with a general polytropic eos for a relativistically hot gas of @xmath0 , as studied in lou & cao ( 2008 ) . for both background and perturbations , the two values of @xmath20",
    "are taken to be the same ; the case of two different values of @xmath20 will be explored separately .",
    "analogous to the mode classification of stellar oscillations in a non - rotating static star ( e.g. cowling 1941 ) , our 3d general polytropic perturbations are divided into four distinct classes of modes , viz .",
    "p@xmath1modes , f@xmath1modes , g@xmath2modes ( i.e. with @xmath174 ) and g@xmath3modes ( i.e. with @xmath270 ) , according to their eigenvalue regimes of parameter @xmath116 in equation ( [ pf1 ] ) .",
    "stability properties of these different perturbation modes are analyzed .",
    "similar to stellar oscillations , acoustic p@xmath1modes and f@xmath1modes remain stable for 3d general polytropic perturbations in homologous stellar core collapse .",
    "this more general conclusion also confirms the acoustic p@xmath1mode stabilities claimed by gw although their p@xmath1mode eigenvalues appear in systematic errors .",
    "the temporal amplification factor @xmath239 in the perturbation magnitude is associated with the background gas compression during a homologous inner core collapse .",
    "in contrast , g@xmath3modes and sufficiently high - order g@xmath2modes are both convectively unstable modes because the onset criterion of convective instabilities is now shifted from @xmath270 for a static general polytropic sphere to @xmath240 for a collapsing general polytropic core where @xmath78 characterizes the hydrodynamic background of a homologously collapsing stellar core .",
    "the existence of both types of g@xmath1modes depends on @xmath6 , the square of the brunt@xmath1v@xmath5is@xmath5l@xmath4 buoyancy frequency ( see definition [ bvfreq ] ) which is determined by the evolution of the specific entropy distribution @xmath66 .",
    "meanwhile , above what value of perturbation degree @xmath139 the g@xmath1modes are unstable also depends on the specific form of @xmath66 . as an example , the lowest - order @xmath7 unstable g@xmath2mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the peak amplitudes of g@xmath3modes lie in regions of @xmath145 , which is analogous to those in stellar oscillations .",
    "these unstable g@xmath1modes lead to growths of convective motions in a self - similar collapsing stellar core .",
    "their divergent growths scale as power laws in time @xmath63 ( with @xmath271 ) while stable perturbation modes oscillate in the manner of @xmath237 .    in analyzing this perturbation problem",
    ", we also realize that the global energy criterion of chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) is not sufficient to ensure the stability of general polytropic equilibria in view of the possible occurrence of convective instabilities for variable entropy distributions ( appendix c ) .",
    "compared to possible sources of perturbations proposed in earlier models , including the so - called  @xmath272mechanism \" before the onset of inner core collapse and sasi after the core bounce , our g@xmath1mode convective instabilities occur during the dynamic core collapse .",
    "contrary to earlier theoretical notions , the pre - sn stellar core collapse phase is most likely convectively unstable due to both types of g@xmath1mode instabilities .",
    "this is because an exactly constant specific entropy everywhere in a stellar core should be extremely rare in any realistic progenitor star ( e.g. bruenn 1985 ) .",
    "therefore , the spherical symmetry of a self - similar collapsing stellar core should be actually broken up earlier than presumed by most previous models of sne .    in our scenario , oscillations of the progenitor star",
    "serve as the most natural source for 3d perturbations .",
    "for some regions of @xmath179 leading to @xmath145 locally , the unstable g@xmath3modes , of which low - degree modes may have sufficiently fast growth rates , will soon dominate and destroy the spherical symmetry .",
    "if @xmath182 everywhere , high - order unstable g@xmath2modes will grow in a self - similar collapsing core and evolve nonlinearly .    in the presence of inevitable core g@xmath1mode convective instabilities , several possible consequences may follow .",
    "most prominently , the early break - up of spherical symmetry may lead to energy concentration in particular directions and there is thus no need for a rebound shock to push against the entire outer envelope .",
    "the low - order unstable @xmath7 g@xmath1modes may give rise to the initial kick of a remnant central compact object .",
    "meanwhile unstable g@xmath1modes correspond to the growth of convective motions which may stir up heavier elements fe , si , o and c in different inner layers of the collapsing core inside a massive progenitor via convective turbulence so that a mixed distribution of these elements to various extents in sn remnants is expected .",
    "this prediction of our model can be tested by nuclear abundance observations in sne .",
    "we further suspect that the nonlinear evolution of low - order unstable @xmath8 g@xmath1mode instabilities might disintegrate the central proto - neutron star core into two blobs to form binary pulsar systems under favorable conditions .",
    "other high - order high - degree unstable g@xmath1modes might even prevent the formation of a coherent central compact object by breaking the core into multiple pieces .",
    "it is speculated that this might happen to supernova sn1987a without signals from a central remnant compact object .",
    "high - degree and high - order g@xmath1mode instabilities may lead to smaller blobs of low masses which might eventually form planets around a neutron star after a sn explosion .",

    "evidently , this does not guarantee the linear stability of such a equilibrium configuration .",
    "the simple total energy criterion is not enough to judge the stability of the equilibrium configuration .",
    "the statement of chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) is only valid because the assumption of a conventional polytropic gas excludes g@xmath1modes , leaving them as convectively neutral .",
