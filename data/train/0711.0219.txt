    "the exponent @xmath24 is best possible even for the subclass of functions that are bounded and univalent in @xmath1 .",
    "theorem a is due to keogh @xcite ( who attributes it to j.e .",
    "littlewood ) and also to rosenblatt ( see @xcite ) .",
    "both keogh and rosenblatt state the result for bounded univalent functions but , as remarked by jenkins @xcite , their proof is valid without change for functions in @xmath7 .",
    "theorem a has been extended in @xcite where the following two local versions are proved ( see @xcite , pp.492 - 493 and theorem 1 ) .",
    "[ b ] suppose that @xmath0 is analytic in @xmath1 , and that for some stolz region @xmath25 at @xmath18 , @xmath26 has finite area .",

    "theorem b appears to be stronger than theorem a , and its proof in @xcite is substantially harder than a proof of theorem a. we shall show that theorems a and b are equivalent up to a very simple argument in hyperbolic geometry ( which involves no function theory at all ) .",
    "indeed , our first objective is to understand theorems a , b and c from a geometric point of view , and we shall show that all three results are more transparent when placed in the context of the hyperbolic geometry of a plane domain .",
    "the class of universal covering maps includes the class of univalent maps , and we know of no bounds in the literature on @xmath32 for universal covering maps .",

    "it follows that the euclidean length of @xmath38)$ ] is the same as its hyperbolic length ; thus @xmath44 as @xmath21 .",
    "the striking feature of this example is that we have ` lost ' the exponent @xmath24 from the estimate in ( 1.2 ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath24 in theorem a is best possible , and the work in this paper was partly motivated by the desire to understand why this exponent appears in the estimates for functions in the dirichlet class but not for universal covering maps .",
    "the explanation of this will be given in terms of hyperbolic geometry in section 9 .",
    "we shall also discuss why , for geometric reasons , other exponents arise in other circumstances .",
    "we regard this as the most interesting part of the paper , and our geometric treatment of theorems a , b and c should be regarded as preparation for this work .",
    "we come now to the idea that underpins most of the work in this paper . as the hyperbolic metric ( and not the euclidean metric )",
    "is the natural metric on @xmath1 , when we consider an analytic map @xmath8 we should primarily be concerned with _ the change of scale from the hyperbolic metric to the euclidean metric _ , and not with the euclidean change of scale @xmath45 .",
    "now the hyperbolic metric @xmath46 on @xmath1 is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "it follows , then , that _ the primary role in this discussion should be given to the function _",
    "@xmath49 and that we should consider @xmath22 to be the integral of this function with respect to the hyperbolic length on @xmath50 ; that is , @xmath51 further , as the geodesic segment @xmath5 $ ] has hyperbolic length @xmath52 , where @xmath53 it seems clear that ( 1.2 ) should be written as @xmath54 the use of the apparently simpler term @xmath55 in ( 1.2 ) only serves to conceal the geometry behind these estimates .",
    "of even greater importance is the fact that the hyperbolic metric is conformally invariant whereas the logarithmic term in ( 1.2 ) is not . to summarize these ideas , our view is that @xmath56    to develop this idea further , the class @xmath7 should now be considered to be the class of analytic maps @xmath8 for which the basic scaling function @xmath57 is square - integrable over the hyperbolic plane . of course",
    ", one can also consider the other @xmath58-spaces of functions @xmath0 for which @xmath59 these spaces occur in the theory of automorphic functions ( they are the @xmath60 spaces , with @xmath61 , introduced by bers ) , and we shall consider them briefly in this context in section 5 . to illustrate these ideas , we pause to show that _ if @xmath62 is square - integrable over the hyperbolic plane ( that is , if @xmath12 ) , then @xmath8 is a lipschitz map with respect to the natural metrics on @xmath1 and @xmath2_. this is our next result , and we give the best lipschitz constant .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 . then , for any @xmath63 in @xmath1 , @xmath64 further , for each @xmath63 , equality occurs when @xmath65 .",
    "this theorem shows that @xmath66 , so @xmath0 is in the bloch class .",
    "the proof , together with much more information about the bloch class , is given by anderson , clunie and pommerenke in @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality gives @xmath69 since @xmath70 and @xmath71 this proves ( 1.6 ) .",
    "the statement about equality is easily verified ( note that for these functions , @xmath72 ) .    this simple application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality underlies all of the results in this paper .",
    "the argument used in the proof above can be strengthened slightly to show that @xmath73 this will be clear from the proof of theorem a in section 3 ( and it shows that any @xmath0 in @xmath7 is in the little bloch class ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline the main ideas concerning the hyperbolic metric of a simple connected domain .",
    "section 3 contains our discussion of theorem a. this contains two examples to show that the exponent @xmath24 in theorem a is best possible , and both are based on hyperbolic geometry .",
    "although one involves a technical geometric estimate ( which is of value in its own right ) , these examples are completely transparent .",
    "we also give a geometric proof of a result which includes theorem a for univalent functions as a special case . in section 4",
    "we show how theorem b follows from theorem a in an elementary way using only hyperbolic geometry .",
    "this proof is considerably shorter than the published proof of theorem b ; it is based on a conformally invariant form of theorem a , and it applies without change to many other subdomains of @xmath1 .",
    "section 5 is concerned with theorem c and it contains a geometric proof of this and some results about @xmath58-spaces .",
    "the proof of theorem c in @xcite depends on an integral inequality due to marcinkiewicz and zygmund , and in section 6 we show that the published proof of this inequality is a euclidean version of a standard argument in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we have already noted that the exponent @xmath24 in theorem a is best possible , but kennedy and twomey @xcite have shown how we can obtain more detailed information on the rate of growth of @xmath22 .",
    "see also balogh and bonk @xcite .",
    "we complete our discussion of the known results in sections 7 and 8 where we discuss their result , a generalization of it to @xmath58-spaces , and some known estimates on the basic scaling function @xmath74 . in the remaining sections of the paper we raise and discuss the analogous issues for universal cover maps instead of functions in the dirichlet class . finally ,",
    "in the appendix , we give the proofs of some of the geometric results that we have used in the earlier sections .",
    "the authors are grateful for helpful comments by t. carroll and j.b .",
    "twomey on an earlier draft of this paper .",
    "each simply connected proper subdomain @xmath75 of @xmath2 supports a hyperbolic metric @xmath76 with density @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and where @xmath79 is any conformal map of @xmath1 onto @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath77 and @xmath76 are independent of the choice of @xmath79 , and that @xmath79 is an isometry from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",

    "next , @xmath77 is continuous and positive on @xmath75 . if @xmath75 is bounded , then @xmath86 as @xmath63 approaches @xmath85 , and so @xmath77 has a positive lower bound , say @xmath87 , on @xmath75 .",
    "thus if @xmath0 is bounded and univalent in @xmath1 , and @xmath88 , then @xmath89 and @xmath90 these conclusions explain some of the earlier results in geometric terms ( albeit in the simpler case of bounded univalent maps ) .",
    "they show , for example , that if @xmath0 is bounded and univalent on @xmath1 then the map @xmath8 is lipschitz with respect to the natural metrics on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "theorem 1.2 gives a stronger result than this ; however , this argument goes beyond theorem 1.2 .",
    "a domain @xmath75 is a _ bloch domain _",
    "if @xmath75 does not contains arbitrary large euclidean discs , and it is clear from ( 2.2 ) that a simply connected domain @xmath75 is a bloch domain if and only if @xmath77 has a positive lower bound on @xmath75 . thus _",
    "if @xmath91 is a univalent map of @xmath1 onto a bloch domain @xmath75 , then @xmath8 is lipschitz with respect to the natural metrics on @xmath1 and @xmath2_. of course , in this case @xmath0 need not be in @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we note that ( 2.4 ) goes some way to explaining why @xmath92 may tend to zero as @xmath21 . as @xmath22 is the integral of @xmath57 over a hyperbolic segment of length @xmath52",
    ", we certainly see that if ( 2.4 ) holds , then @xmath93 .",
    "more generally , if the convergence in ( 2.4 ) is sufficiently rapid , we might expect to get some result of the form @xmath94 as @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath95 may tend to @xmath96 as @xmath21 , it is perhaps harder to see why the estimates of @xmath22 might hold if we take the euclidean point of view and integrate @xmath97 with respect to euclidean length on @xmath31 .",
    "keogh s proof of theorem a in @xcite is short and elementary , and for completeness we include it here .",
    "after this we give two examples to show that the exponent @xmath24 is best possible , and we end with a geometric proof of a similar result .",
    "it suffices to prove the result for @xmath98 , and we write @xmath99 .",
    "then , for each positive integer @xmath100 , @xmath101 as @xmath102 converges , ( 1.2 ) follows from this .",
    "we continue our discussion of theorem a by providing the following conformally invariant version of it .",
    "it is essential that we use the conformally invariant hyperbolic length here rather than the classical bound @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that @xmath103 is a domain that is conformally equivalent to @xmath1 , and that @xmath0 is analytic in @xmath103 with @xmath104 of finite area @xmath10 .",
    "then , for any hyperbolic geodesic segment @xmath105 in @xmath103 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the euclidean length of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the hyperbolic length of @xmath105 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath103 has finite area @xmath27 , then @xmath110 .",
    "this is easy .",
    "we can find a conformal map @xmath79 of @xmath103 onto @xmath1 in such a way that @xmath79 maps @xmath105 onto some real segment @xmath111 $ ] of @xmath1 , and then apply keogh s result to @xmath112 defined by @xmath113 .",
    "if we take @xmath114 ( and @xmath115 ) in the proof given above , we obtain @xmath116 and this gives the stated inequality because @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119    the estimate @xmath120 is universally valid over all geodesic segments @xmath105 .",
    "however , if we take @xmath105 to be the initial segment of any geodesic ray starting from a fixed point of @xmath103 then , exactly as in keogh s result , we can show that @xmath121 .",
    "this will be considered further in section 4 .",
    "theorem a applies to all functions in the dirichlet space @xmath7 .",
    "however in @xcite , keogh showed that the exponent @xmath24 in theorem a is best possible when the result is restricted to the smaller class of functions that are bounded and univalent in @xmath1 .",
    "further examples were given by jenkins @xcite , kennedy @xcite , and carroll and twomey @xcite , to show that not only is the exponent @xmath24 in theorem a best possible , but so is the function on the right hand side of ( 1.2 ) , and we shall look at these results in section 7 .",
    "keogh s example in @xcite is based on the function @xmath122 , where @xmath79 is a conformal map of @xmath1 onto a half - infinite strip , and @xmath123 is a suitable constant , and his argument is technical , and not self - contained . in our examples ( examples 3.2 and 3.3 ) we study the analytic properties of a univalent map @xmath124 indirectly through the hyperbolic geometry of @xmath125 .",

    "it seems likely that , given any @xmath123 in @xmath138 , one could construct a multiply connected domain with finite area in which @xmath518 for a suitable geodesic .",

    "we emphasize that the problem of estimating @xmath226 in terms of @xmath224 is more difficult than the original problem of obtaining an estimate in terms of @xmath492 because the schwarz - pick lemma shows that for any analytic hyperbolic @xmath0 we have @xmath541 .",

    "this completes the proof of theorem 10.1 .    finally , we observe that the proof of theorem 10.1 also provides a proof of the following result .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is analytic and hyperbolic in @xmath1 , and that the function @xmath77 is bounded below on the ray @xmath31 .",

    "we complete this paper by giving the proofs of theorem 3.4 , and of lemmas 6.1 and 6.2 .",
    "we begin with a proof of theorem 3.4 , this will follow from a result showing how hyperbolic geodesics move when we expand a domain and we will use the observation that a geodesic is the level set for harmonic measure . let @xmath123 be a closed arc of the unit circle and @xmath127 the complementary arc . then the harmonic measure for @xmath123 in @xmath554",
