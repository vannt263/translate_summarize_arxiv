    "the mixed - conducting nonstoichiometric silver and copper chalcogenides ag@xmath0x and cu@xmath0x ( x = s , se , te ) are well known for their unusual transport properties .",
    "thus , a number of phases exhibit both a high electronic and a high ionic conductivity , leading to extremely high chemical diffusion coefficients in those phases which also possess a high thermodynamic factor @xcite . in addition , silver selenide and silver telluride are currently studied as interesting high temperature mr ( magneto resistance ) materials @xcite .",
    "the preparation of well defined bulk material ag@xmath0x and cu@xmath0x is mostly based on the co - melting of metal and chalcogen or on reactive growth from the elements @xcite .",
    "unfortunately both systems undergo phase transformations , and it is a difficult task to grow untwinned single crystals of the room temperature phases . in the present case of ag@xmath0se a phase transformation from the low temperature @xmath1-phase to",
    "the high temperature @xmath2-phase occurs at @xmath3 .",
    "thus , ag@xmath0se being prepared by co - melting is always polycrystalline .",
    "an additional problem is caused by the nonstoichiometry @xmath4 . despite being small",
    ", it controls the defect concentrations , and thus , may have a significant influence on the transport properties @xcite . obviously , the magnitude of this direct influence depends on the intrinsic defect concentrations .",
    "the low and high temperature phases are characterized by maximum deviations from stoichiometry @xmath4 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "as the band gap of ag@xmath0se is very small ( @xmath7 ) , such small metal excess creates only small changes of the electronic conductivity , however , the concentration of ionic defects increases considerably .",
    "this may change the electronic conductivity indirectly , by increasing the concentration of scattering centers .",
    "@xmath4 can only be fixed to a desired value by equilibration of a ag@xmath0se sample with a silver or selenium reservoir with known activity or by coulometric titration .",
    "studies of the mr effect of @xmath1-ag@xmath0se ( low - temperature phase ) with such well controlled @xmath4 have only been reported by @xcite , and show that the size of the mr effect indeed depends strongly on  @xmath4 .    mostly driven by the diverse and attractive mr properties of ag@xmath0se ,",
    "the need for reproducible thin film preparation arises .",
    "but to the best of our knowledge there is yet no method available to grow ag@xmath0se films of high quality , i.e. with well defined morphology , composition and thickness . to explore the best method for the deposition of ag@xmath0se",
    ", we therefore investigated different methods for the preparation of thin films of silver and copper chalcogenides , focusing to silver selenide as the most prominent magnetoresistive material within the group of materials . as the chemical properties of silver and copper chalcogenides are quite close , the general results are probably valid for all of them .",
    "basically we compared three different approaches : ( a ) reactive growth of thin films starting from thin films of metal and elemental chalcogen , ( b ) thermal evaporation of the compounds , ( c ) pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) of the compounds .",
    "results from the first two methods are already described in the literature @xcite @xcite , and our findings are close to those . so the major purpose of this paper is to present the results of the pld and to discuss its advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : firstly , we briefly describe the preparation of thin ag@xmath0se films by pulsed laser deposition in argon as background gas . secondly , we summarize the structural , microstructural and morphological properties of the thin films , as the microstructure , morphology and the metal to chalcogen ratio ( and its gradient across a film ) are the key factors for the quality of a film .",
    "thirdly , we report on mr effect measurements of the films prepared by pld .",
    "finally , we compare our findings with previous reports on the mr effect in bulk and thin film material and show that pld provides thin films with better quality than those grown by pvd ( physical vapor deposition ) , sputtering or reactive growth .",
    "_ pld _ : for the deposition process of ag@xmath0se we used a vacuum chamber ( minimum pressure @xmath8 pa ) equipped with a turbomolecular pump and a cold trap ( liquid nitrogen ) to avoid a selenium contamination of the pumping system .",
    "a krf - excimer laser ( @xmath9 248 nm , compex 201 , lambda - physik , gttingen , germany ) was used for the ablation process . in order to optimize the film quality with respect to homogeneity and density we varied the pulse energy @xmath10 between 200 and 250 mj ( approximately ( 6  -  8)  @xmath11 ) , the repetition rate @xmath12 between 5 and 10 hz , the pressure of the background gas between 1 and 10 pa and the substrate temperature between 308 and 473 k. argon was used as the background gas .",
    "the distance between the target and the substrate can be varied between 40 and 100  mm , but in all experiments shown here the distance was adjusted to 45  mm .",
    "films with a thickness between 4  nm and 3  m were prepared .",
    "_ characterisation _ : the morphology of all films was routinely characterised by hrsem ( high resolution scanning electron microscopy , leo gemini 982 ) and the composition was determined with edx ( energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy , oxford inca ) .",
    "selected samples were investigated by xrd ( x - ray diffractometry ) and in situ xrd ( 2@xmath13 geometry ) .",
    "sufficiently thin films were placed on alumina grids which were fixed in a side - entry , double - tilt holder .",
    "high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) and selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) were performed in a philips cm30st ( 300  kv , lab@xmath14 cathode , cs = 1.15  mm ) .",
    "edx was performed in the scanning- and nanoprobe mode of cm30st with a si / li - edx detector ( noran , vantage system ) .",
    "_ targets : _ bulk silver selenide as target material for the laser ablation was prepared by co - melting of the elements in sealed silica ampoules at 1200 k ( for 24 h , left to cool in air ) in the appropriate ratio . during the ablation",
    "the target rotated continuously , and the point of incidence of the laser was shifted in order to obtain a laterally more homogeneous ablation .",
    "targets with different composition were used to prepare films with well known silver / selenium ratio .    _ substrates : _ we used freshly cleaved mgo single crystal pieces ( 10x10 mm@xmath15 , 1 mm thickness ) with well reproducible adhesive properties .",
    "freshly cleaved single crystalline nacl was used for the preparation of tem samples . in this case",
    "we deposited thin films with a thickness of only 20 to 30  nm . these silver selenide films were easily separated from the nacl substrate in water ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and then transfered to tem aluminium grids .",
    "copper grids which are more common in tem could not be used , as they undergo a displacement reaction with silver selenide even at room temperature . for some of the xrd measurements",
    "we also used fused ( x - ray amorphous ) silica as substrate , being cleaned with hot chromic / sulfuric acid before the deposition .",
    "_ temperature : _ the substrate temperature during the deposition was measured in the substrate holder ( steel ) at the back of the the target with a ni / crni - thermocouple .",
    "an additional thermocouple fixed on the surface of the substrate was used to check the temperature during the deposition .",
    "the temperature difference between substrate surface and the back of the substrate never exceeded 4 to 5  k.    _ magnetoresistance-(mr)-effect : _ the mr effect of all films were measured by a standard four - probe dc method .",
    "the magnetic field was applied by a 17  t superconducting magnet system ( oxford ) with the temperature control ranging from 2 to 300  k.    _ film thickness : _ after the mr measurements the substrate / film samples were cleaved to allow a precise thickness measurement by hrsem . for film thicknesses below 25",
    "nm the resolution of the hrsem was not sufficient , and we calculated the thickness from the deposition time ( extrapolated with the almost linear relation between film thickness and deposition time ) .",

    "[ fig : v1303b ] and [ fig : v1803b ] show typical surface areas of films which have been deposited with a different repetition rate .",
    "both higher argon background pressures and smaller repetition rate led to a poor film quality with many large droplets and crystallites on top of the surface .",
    "+ the background pressure influences also the selenium concentration in the film . with increased pressure and therefore higher flow rate of the background gas we found a decrease of the selenium concentration from ( 30.1@xmath160.3 ) atom-% to ( 28.8@xmath160.4 ) atom-% by edx . regions or areas with an increased silver concentration could not be detected , i.e. the films are homogeneous with respect to the chemical composition .",

    "after the heating / cooling cycle the reflections of the low temperature phase ( tt1 ) appear more pronounced , i.e. the microstructure of the film has changed during the cycle .",

    "the films prepared by pld show a high quality regarding their density , their compositional homogeneity and their morphology . a high background pressure reduces the free mean path of ions , atoms and small molecular clusters during pld and increases the deposition rate of larger clusters and droplets . in the present case an argon pressure of 2  pa with a small flow rate led to the best results",
    ". a higher repetition rate of the laser pulses reduces the time for the ripening of surface defects , whereas a small repetition rate reduces the growth rate of the film . with a repetition rate of 10",
    "hz we obtained the best results , i.e. we obtained dense films with high lateral uniformity and a small concentration of droplets .    as we found by hrtem",
    "the silver selenide films prepared by pld have a specific and unusual microstructure , characterised by the appearance of a second phase of ag@xmath0se ( tt2 ) in coexistence with the well known naumannite phase ( tt1 ) .",
    "this microstructure is best described as a nano - parquet with relatively thick lamellae of the naumannite phase and relatively thin lamellae of the tt2 phase .",
    "thus , pld films of silver selenide are always nanostructured and contain a high concentration of twin boundaries .",
    "the phase diagram of the ag - se system contains only tt1 as the thermodynamically stable low temperature phase .",
    "thus , we assume that tt2 is a metastable phase being a result of the pld process . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the tt2 phase has not been observed before in films being prepared by sputtering or pvd .",
    "with respect to a large and linear mr effect , the silver excess plays a decisive role . a clear and unequivocal explanation of the mr properties of silver - rich silver selenide in terms of a specific micro- and defect structure is still missing , but we found that the presence of very small silver precipitates is a necessary prerequisite for a linear mr effect .",
    "in this respect , pld is unique as it offers the possibility to deposit films under non - equilibrium conditions with a virtually homogeneous chemical composition .",
    "the results of the in situ xrd indicate that as deposited films contain excess silver in the form of very small precipitates with mean diameters below 10  nm . upon heating from room temperature to higher temperatures the size of the silver precipitates increases . along with the increase of the particle size the mr effect decreases , as to be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : v0512-mr ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that a large linear mr effect relies on the presence of silver precipitates with a very small size . in a previous work we found that a silver dispersion on the atomic scale does not maximize the mr effect , rather it leads to a negative mr effect @xcite .",
    "thus , we suggest that there exists an optimal microstructure of the silver / silver selenide dispersion with silver being dispersed in the form of nanosized clusters or nuclei . however , these rather small particles have a strong tendency to ripen , and we have to assume that ripening does even occur at room temperature , due to the large chemical diffusion coefficient of silver in the silver selenide matrix at room temperature or above",
    ". this degradation will become slower at larger sizes of the ag - clusters , but it will not stop , inevitably resulting in a reduction of the mr - effect .",
    "therefore the silver / silver selenide nanodispersion will be a suitable sensor material with only when it comes to low temperature applications .",
    "the problem of sufficient long term stabilities needs to be addressed especially when using very small silver precipitates with sizes of a few nm , which are far from equilibrium condition . with these findings",
    "the way to systematic studies of the correlation between microstructure , chemical composition and mr effect in silver selenide is open , and further measurements are underway .",
    "pld offers an excellent route for the preparation of very thin ( about 10 nm ) and relatively thick ( m range ) and dense silver selenide films with different composition .",
    "the films are homogeneous with respect to the silver / selenium ratio , i.e. the fast ablation of target material by the excimer laser minimize the preferential vaporisation of selenium .",
    "the deposition in a wide range of temperatures allows to prepare films with different microstructures .",
    "the possibility of the deposition of meta stable films at lower temperature with respect of the mr - effect seems especially promising .",
    "+ the deposition parameters background pressure , substrate temperature , laser power and repetition rate can be controlled such that either almost stoichiometric or silver - rich films are deposited .",
    "droplet formation can not be suppressed completely , but appears not to be a problem for the reproducibility of the mr effect .",
    "the main advantage of the pld in comparison to other methods is the possibility to produce homogeneous films in a broad range of thicknesses .",
    "we can avoid lateral or transversal silver concentration gradients as seen in films prepared by pvd methods .",
    "the mr effect is well reproducible for the same film , but scatters for different films with the same thickness , which is due to variations of the precipitate size and their spatial distribution . due to the continuous process it is also possible to study the film during the growth or the cooling down in situ by various methods ( for example conductivity measurement ) .",
