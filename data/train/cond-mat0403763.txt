    "rare earth compounds attract considerable experimental and theoretical attention due to the intricate electronic properties relating to the highly correlated @xmath4-electrons . in the atomic state",
    "most rare earth elements are divalent , but in the solid state the majority form trivalent ions .",
    "the elemental rare earths all become trivalent with the exception of eu and yb which are divalent .",
    "europium compounds can occur in divalent and trivalent configurations .",
    "europium chalcogenides and most of the pnictides crystallise in the simple nacl crystal structure and so form a series that can be studied within first principles theory relatively easily . recently",
    "the chalcogenides have attracted a lot of attention due to their potential applications in spintronic and spin filtering devices .    in a recent paper steeneken _",
    "et al._@xcite have presented evidence that euo is a ferromagnetic semiconductor where the charge carriers exhibit almost 100% spin - polarisation . in this paper",
    "we perform self - consistent electronic structure calculations to investigate , and gain more insight into , this claim .",
    "the eus system has recently been used as a spin filter in a hybrid gd / eus / al device which showed a large magnetoresistance.@xcite unfortunately the low t@xmath5 of 16.8 k in eus makes it unsuitable for commercial applications , but nonetheless this does make it worthwhile to study , in a systematic manner , the electronic and magnetic properties of the remaining eu chalcogenides .",
    "traditional calculations of the electronic structure of rare earth materials treat the @xmath6 and @xmath3 electrons as itinerant , while the @xmath4 electrons are treated as atomic - like .",
    "however , treating electrons within the same material using two different theories is less than satisfactory .",
    "recently self - interaction corrections ( sic)@xcite to the local spin density ( lsd ) approximation to density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have provided us with a successful method of treating all the electrons in rare earth materials on an equal footing .",
    "the self - interaction correction represents an @xmath4-electron localization energy , and the question of which @xmath7 configuration of the rare earth ion will be the most stable is a competition between this localization energy and the energy which an electron may gain by hybridizing into the conduction band states .",
    "this energy balance is a very delicate quantity and may be changed easily by altering external parameters .    in this paper",
    "we briefly describe the sic - lsd formalism in section ii and go on to discuss our calculation of the electronic structure of the eu chalcogenides and pnictides in both the divalent and trivalent states in section iii .",
    "we conclude the paper in section iv .",
    "the standard method for making _ ab - initio _ calculations of the properties of materials is density functional theory with a local approximation for the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "a drawback of this approach is that it introduces a spurious self - interaction for each electron . while these are usually negligible they become important when localisation phenomena are under investigation@xcite .",
    "the sic - lsd scheme is a method of improving the lsd approach by subtracting the spurious interaction of each occupied electron with itself from the usual lsd approximation to the total energy .",
    "this yields a much - improved description of static coulomb correlation effects over the conventional lsd approximation .",
    "examples of the benefits of this approach have been demonstrated in many applications including studies of the hubbard model,@xcite the 3d monoxides,@xcite la@xmath8cuo@xmath9 , @xcite @xmath4-electron systems,@xcite solid hydrogen,@xcite orbital ordering,@xcite and metal - insulator transitions@xcite    in the sic - lsd method the total energy is minimised with respect to both the electron density and the number of electrons from which the self - interaction has been subtracted .",
    "this leads to a determination of the nominal valence in solids defined as the integer number of electrons available to form energy bands @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of atomic core electrons , @xmath12 is the atomic number and @xmath13 is the number of states for which the self - interaction correction has been removed .",
    "this definition means that @xmath14 is 2 for systems normally thought of as divalent and 3 for systems that are trivalent , as one might expect .",
    "most of the rare earth chalcogenides and pnictides crystallise in the common rocksalt structure .",
    "we have performed sic - lsd calculations for eu chalcogenides and pnictides using an lmto method for the band structure.@xcite calculations of the electronic structure have been performed in the ferromagnetic state for all the materials in both the divalent and trivalent state .",
    "whichever of these we find with the lower total energy should be the stable valence .",
    "it is well - known that the lsd approximation to density functional theory does not predict band gaps correctly .",
    "the sic - lsd approach has been shown to improve the calculation of band gaps@xcite , and we would expect that this method could reproduce trends in band gaps fairly reliably .      in figure 1 we show the calculated and experimental lattice constants for all the chalcogenides .",
    "we also show the energy differences between the two valence states .",
    "it is clear that all the europium chalcogenides are divalent .",
    "this is as we would expect on simple shell - filling grounds .",
    "we can also see from this figure that the calculated lattice constants are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the energy difference between the two valence states is fairly independent of chalcogenide for s , se and te and we observe that there is a clear correlation between the lattice constant and the difference in energy between the divalent and trivalent states .    ) .",
    "also shown is the calculated energy difference between the divalent and trivalent form ( squares ) .",
    "a positive value means divalency while a negative value indicates trivalency . for consistency with previous results",
    "the energies here include the 43mry calibration determined for the elemental rare earths and their sulphides by strange _ et .",
    "al._@xcite ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     the density of states again yields very interesting behaviour for these materials when we decompose it by spin . for eun we note from figure 5 that the minority spin density of states is zero at the fermi energy",
    ". the pnictide @xmath2-band density of states falls to zero just below the fermi energy .",
    "the empty @xmath4-state close to the fermi energy is a pure majority spin state .",
    "it hybridises with majority spin @xmath2-states and draws some pnictide majority spin @xmath2-character above the fermi energy .",
    "there is no minority spin character at the fermi energy at all .",
    "so the calculation predicts that eun is a half metallic ferromagnet with a minority spin band gap of @xmath15  ev and a z - component of spin - magnetic moment of @xmath16 .",
    "if we include the expected orbital moment according to hund s rules this would give a total moment of @xmath17 .",
    "as we proceed down the pnictide column of the periodic table there is a transfer of around 1.4 electrons from the pnictide @xmath2-states to the eu @xmath18 bands and the @xmath4-state which sits close to the fermi energy .",
    "the bulk of this transfer occurs between eun and eup , although it continues as we go down the periodic table , and it results in the other europium pnictides being normal metals . to understand the transition from half - metallic to full metallic behaviour we need to make a detailed study of the density of states .",
    "as we go from eun to eup , the lattice constant increases , the minority spin bands move slightly up in energy . the minority spin pnictide @xmath2-states then become less filled and the majority spin eu @xmath4-band at the fermi energy and some of the @xmath18 states have a higher occupancy . during this transition",
    "the minority spin @xmath2-bands actually rise above the fermi energy and the gap is destroyed in this spin channel .",
    "thus , eun is a half - metallic metal , while eup and the other europium pnictides are normal metals .",
    "this extreme sensitivity of the bands to changes in the lattice constant also accounts for the strong dependence of the energy difference between the two valence states on the pnictide atom .    in figure 6",
    "we show the density of states for eusb in the divalent state .",
    "this is the calculated ground state .",
    "we note that the occupied @xmath4-states have risen considerably from their energy in the trivalent state .",
    "the results appear similar to those for the europium chalcogenides ( although there is one fewer electron in the antimonide than in the telluride ) . in the divalent state eusb",
    "is clearly a normal metal . about 0.1 rydbergs above e@xmath19",
    ", eusb just fails to open up a gap which would correspond to the energy gaps in the chalcogenides .",
    "in this paper we have reported a series of electronic structure calculations for the europium chalcogenides and pnictides .",
    "these calculations tell us several things that are interesting from both a fundamental and applied point of view .",
    "firstly we have shown that the eu chalcogenides in their ferromagnetic state are semiconductors and the band gaps for the different spin channels are very different .",
    "therefore we have materials whose carriers will be more or less 100% spin - polarised in the ambient temperature range .",
    "we suggest that , by alloying , it should be possible to create materials with a range of differential band gaps for the different spins . secondly , we have shown that eun is a half - metallic system with a substantial moment in its ferromagnetic state while the other europium pnictides are normal metals .",
    "again we might suggest that alloying of the ferromagnetic pnictides would allow us to have a half metallic system with a range of possible energy gaps in the minority spin channel .",
    "thirdly our calculations strongly suggest that the position of the occupied @xmath4-levels in europium materials is dependent on the valence , but not on the chemical environment , of the europium ion .",
    "finally we predict a valence transition in the europium pnictides as we proceed down the pnictide column of the periodic table which may account for the observed deviation from the common rocksalt crystal structure expected for euas and eusb .",
    "it seems that the europium chalcogenides and pnictides are possible candidates for spintronic and spin filtering applications .",
