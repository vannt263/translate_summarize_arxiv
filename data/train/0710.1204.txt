    "the processing of information based on the laws of quantum physics @xcite has become a very active field of research during the last decade . for the experimental demonstration of fundamental key results of quantum information theory ,",
    "ion - trap based systems have played a major role .",
    "the success of ion trap experiments can be attributed to the fact that encoding quantum information in either hyperfine ground or meta - stable excited atomic states provides well - defined quantum bits ( qubits ) with long coherence times .",
    "the use of lasers for manipulating the qubit state allows for precisely switchable interactions with low decoherence rates .",
    "the fundamental operations of qubit initialization , arbitrary single qubit manipulation and quantum state - detection have already been used in atomic clocks with single ions for many years .",
    "contrary to other realizations @xcite of quantum information processing , the most demanding operation in ion traps consists in the realization of an entangling gate operation . because of the repulsive coulomb force , the inter - ion distance is orders of magnitude bigger than the characteristic length scale of any state - dependent interaction between ions in ground or low - lying excited states . in all current experiments creating entangled ions @xcite ,",
    "gate operations rely on interactions that are mediated by the vibrational degrees of freedom of the ion string .",
    "these gate operations fall into two categories :    1 .",
    "quantum gates induced by a laser beam that interacts with a single ion at a time as originally proposed in the seminal paper by i. cirac and p. zoller @xcite and later realized by the innsbruck ion trapping group @xcite . in these gates , a single ion is entangled with a vibrational mode @xcite of the ion string and the entanglement is subsequently transferred from the vibrational mode to the internal state of a second ion .",
    "2 .   quantum gates induced by a bichromatic laser that collectively interacts with two or more ions . here , a vibrational mode becomes transiently entangled with the qubits before getting disentangled at the end of the gate operation , resulting in an effective interactions between the qubits capable of entangling them .",
    "gates of this type were first proposed by g.  milburn @xcite , a.  srensen , k.  mlmer @xcite and e.  solano @xcite , and subsequently realized by ion trapping groups in boulder , ann arbor and oxford @xcite .",
    "even though both classes of gates are applicable to hyperfine qubits as well as optical qubits ( i.e. qubits encoded in hyperfine states or in states linked by a dipole - forbidden transition with an optical wavelength ) , current experiments with optical qubits have relied on the former and experiments with hyperfine qubits on the latter type of interaction . in any case , the main goal consists in demonstrating fast operations creating entanglement with high fidelity .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss bichromatic gate operations with a focus on implementations using an optical transition .",
    "it turns out that for optical transitions , gate operations are achievable by illuminating the ions with an amplitude - modulated laser beam that is resonant with the qubit transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : bichromaticgates ] reviews different methods of realizing bichromatic quantum gates and discusses properties that are specific to their application to optical qubits . in section [ sec : effectivehamiltonian ] , an effective hamiltonian for the laser - ion interaction will be derived by going into a reference frame rotating at non - uniform speed in order to eliminate non - resonant excitations of the qubit transition that do not couple to the vibrational mode . in this way",
    ", it will be shown that for a single ion qubit the interaction is well described by a hamiltonian @xmath2 where the coupling strength @xmath3 is proportional to the laser intensity in the limit of low intensities but starts to saturate at higher intensities and where @xmath4 is a component of the pauli spin operator @xmath5 coupling to a vibrational mode of the ion described by creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that @xmath8 depends not only on the particular type of gate operation but also on the laser intensity and the relative phase between the two frequencies of the bichromatic field",
    ". equations ( [ heffzz ] ) , ( [ heffms ] ) , ( [ mspropagator2 ] ) describing the action of the gates based on @xmath0 and on @xmath1 ( mlmer - srensen ) interactions are the key results of the paper . for the mlmer - srensen gate , the result will be compared to the analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the performance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gates will be compared .",
    "section [ sec : shapedpulses ] shows how to use pulse - shaping of the laser intensity as well as spin echo techniques to make the gates more robust against fluctuations of the control parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 describes a harmonic oscillator oscillating at frequency  @xmath10 and driven by a force with frequency  @xmath11 and coupling strength  @xmath12 . going into an interaction picture defined by @xmath13 yields the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 . under the action of the driving force ,",
    "an oscillator that is initially in a coherent state remains in a coherent state . for a force that is slightly detuned from resonance , the coherent state maps out a circle in phase space and returns to the initial state after a period @xmath16",
    "this operation multiplies the oscillator state by a phase factor whose magnitude is given by the ratio of the strength of the force and the detuning as shown in @xcite .    in order to allow for variations of the driving field s strength",
    ", we generalize the hamiltonian to @xmath17 and calculate its propagator @xmath18 by using the baker - campbell - hausdorff relation @xmath19 for the displacement operator @xmath20 . for the propagator , we find @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in case of a driving force with constant amplitude , @xmath25 , one obtains @xmath26 and @xmath27 . after a time @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,",
    "the coherent state returns to its initial state in phase space with its phase changed by an amount @xmath30 . by making this phase change depend on the internal states of a pair of ions , an entangling gate operation can be achieved . for @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an operator acting on the qubit states , the propagator ( [ propagatordrivenosc ] ) is replaced by @xmath33 choosing the interaction time @xmath34 such that @xmath35 thus realizes a propagator that depends nonlinearly on @xmath32 and does not alter the vibrational state .",
    "the interaction of a single ion qubit resonantly excited by a monochromatic laser field with frequency @xmath36 is usually described by performing a rotating - wave approximation with respect to the optical frequency to obtain the hamiltonian @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the detuning from the qubit transition frequency @xmath39 , @xmath10 is the frequency of the ion s vibrational mode of interest , and @xmath40 with the pauli matrices @xmath41 . the strength of the laser - ion coupling is characterized by the rabi frequency @xmath12 , and the strength of processes involving changes in the vibrational state is determined by the value of the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ laserionhamiltonian ] ) represents a hamiltonian in an interaction picture that is defined with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath43 describing the ion qubit in the absence of any laser - ion interactions . if @xmath44 , the lamb - dicke approximation @xmath45 is used to simplify ( [ laserionhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the resulting three terms describe excitations on the carrier , the lower and the upper motional sideband , respectively .",
    "the generalization of the hamiltonian to the case of two and more ions is straightforward . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", calculations in section [ sec : effectivehamiltonian ] will be limited to the case of the laser coupling to the centre - of - mass mode along the axis of the ion string where all ions experience the same coupling strength .",
    "a detailed account of laser - ion interactions is given in @xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian as described by ( [ drivenoscillator ] ) was employed for the first time in an experiment @xcite creating a schrdinger cat state with a single ion using @xmath46 , i.e. a coupling to the motional mode that depended on the internal energy eigenstate of the ion .",
    "later , it was realized that the same type of coupling could be used to entangle a pair of ions by performing a conditional phase gate @xcite . in the experimental realizations",
    "@xcite , spin - dependent forces acting on a pair of hyperfine or zeeman ground states have been realized by near resonant driving of raman transitions between vibrational states ( see figure  [ fig1:motionalcoupling_hyperfine ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , two non - copropagating laser beams with frequencies @xmath47 form a moving standing wave with difference frequency @xmath48 close to the frequency @xmath10 of a vibrational mode .",
    "the ac - stark shift of the qubit states @xmath49,@xmath50 results from a non - resonant coupling to another atomic state @xmath51 that is made qubit state - dependent by properly chosen polarizations .",
    "since the laser field exhibits a strong spatiotemporal modulation , the resulting potential gradients induce a force acting on the qubits that is state - dependent and that couples to the vibrational mode by displacing the qubit along a circle in phase space .",
    "when the ions couple to the centre - of - mass mode ( stretch mode ) , the coupling to the mode can be made to disappear when both qubits are in the same quantum state by choosing an ion spacing that is an odd ( even ) integer multiple of half the wavelength of the moving standing wave . disregarding unimportant global and single qubit phases ,",
    "this coupling is then described by an operator @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a collective spin component of the qubits .",

    "the laser detunings @xmath54 from the mediating states are large compared with trap frequency @xmath10 and the qubit level spacing @xmath39 to avoid spontaneous emission from state @xmath51 .",
    "constructive interference of paths 1 and 2 is achieved for counter - propagating laser beams .",

    "similarly , a coupling between the states @xmath58 is mediated by the state @xmath49 . to achieve a strong coupling , a detuning @xmath59 from the intermediate states",
    "can be chosen that is smaller than the transition frequency between vibrational states provided that the decay rate of the metastable state is small compared to @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath60 , the two interfering paths shown in figure  [ fig1:motionalcoupling_optical]a connecting levels @xmath57 have equal strength . since the detunings from the mediating states now have opposite signs , destructive interference is achieved for counter - propagating beams whereas the coupling is maximized for co - propagating beams . in the limit of small excitation ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath62 on the raman transition between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 are coupled with equal strength but opposite sign . for stronger excitation ,",
    "the carrier transition is non - resonantly excited which leads to a saturation of @xmath62 .",
    "as long as the intensities of the bichromatic beams are equal , there is no overall ac - stark shift due to excitation of the carrier transition and the first motional sidebands because ac - stark shifts caused by the two laser fields exactly cancel each other .    in the case of two ions excited on the centre - of - mass mode",
    ", a driven quantum mechanical oscillator is realized with collective atomic oscillator @xmath52 .",
    "in addition to the coupling of vibrational states , there is another small mlmer - srensen coupling @xcite that does not exist for the case of hyperfine or zeeman qubits : collective spin flips between the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 occur by processes involving a blue and a red photon that are mediated by the states @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see figure  [ fig : msgate_scheme ] ) . a similar process involving either two blue or two red photons couples the states @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ".     is mediated by the states @xmath74 and vice versa on the narrow qubit transition .",
    "since spontaneous scattering from the mediating state is small , the detuning can be made small compared to the trap frequency . for @xmath75 , the coupling is maximized by choosing a copropagating beam geometry .",
    "( b ) optimum coupling is achieved for co - propagating laser beams with frequencies @xmath55 , @xmath56 propagating along the axis of vibration of the motional mode of interest . as the bichromatic laser field",
    "could also be described by a monochromatic laser field that is amplitude - modulated with a frequency @xmath48 close to the vibrational frequency , no spatially varying ac - stark shifts are involved in the coupling . , width=453 ]      in contrast to @xmath0 gates that do not change the internal states of the ions , the @xmath1 gate operations first investigated by a.  srensen , k.  mlmer @xcite and others @xcite relies on collective spin flips @xmath76 , @xmath77 by processes coupling to the lower and upper motional sidebands as illustrated in figure  [ fig : msgate_scheme ] .",

    ", it is again possible to choose a pair of co - propagating beams for performing the gate operation .",
    "the only difference to the @xmath0 gate consists in the choice of laser frequencies @xmath83 required for achieving a resonant coupling .",
    "formally , the gate operation is equivalent to a @xmath0 interaction in a rotated basis . to stress this analogy ,",
    "the mlmer - srensen gate operation is often also called a @xmath1 gate .",
    "the possibility of choosing co - propagating laser beams for performing either @xmath0 or @xmath1 gates is attractive from an experimental point of view .",
    "the light field could be generated by passing a laser beam through an acousto - optical modulator driven by two radio - frequency fields and subsequently coupling the first - order diffracted beams into a single - mode optical fibre , thus realizing a simple and stable setup .",
    "gate operations could also be achieved by phase - modulating a laser with a modulation frequency close to @xmath10 by choosing a modulation index where the carrier strength vanishes . however , this approach has the strong disadvantage that even small changes of the modulation index from the desired value give rise to light resonant with the transition which is having desastrous effects on the gate performance .",
    "similarly , modulating at frequency close to @xmath84 and using the carrier and one of the first sidebands is problematic because of light shifts induced by the other sidebands . ]",
    "if the rabi frequencies @xmath85 ,  @xmath86 of the blue and the red detuned laser beam are equal , light shifts due to the non - resonant excitation of the carrier transition and the first - order sidebands are exactly cancelled .",
    "light shifts arising from coupling to other zeeman transitions or far - detuned dipole transitions could be cancelled by suitably balancing the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "we are interested in deriving an effective hamiltonian that accurately describes the dynamics on a pair of optical qubits induced by a co - propagating bichromatic laser field with frequencies @xmath88 , where the detuning is either close to half the vibrational frequency or close to the vibrational frequency , i.  e. @xmath89 or @xmath90 with @xmath91 . as optical qubits interacting with lasers typically have smaller lamb - dicke parameters than hyperfine qubits coupled by raman transitions , transient non - resonant excitation of the carrier transition is expected to play an important role for @xmath92 . whereas usually non - resonant interactions are taken into account only qualitatively after having derived an effective hamiltonian , in the following calculation they will be eliminated right at the beginning by going into a reference frame rotating at non - uniform speed .",
    "the hamiltonian for the bichromatic laser field we are interested in , is given by @xmath93 the laser is assumed to interact collectively with @xmath94 ions on the axial centre - of - mass mode .",
    "here , @xmath95 , and @xmath7 ,  @xmath6 denote operators annihilating and creating phonons .",
    "it is also possible to interpret this interaction as being due to a single resonant laser beam that is amplitude - modulated with modulation frequency @xmath96 .",
    "the optical phase of the laser field is denoted @xmath97 , and the phase @xmath98 accounts for a time difference between the start of the gate operation and the maximum of the amplitude modulation on the laser beam . using the picture of an amplitude - modulated resonant beam ,",
    "it is obvious that there are fast dynamical processes on the carrier transition with a periodicity given by @xmath16 that excite the ions to the other state in the first half of the period and transfer it back to the original state in the second half .",
    "we are not really interested in exactly calculating the dynamical evolution of the quantum state on this fast time scale .",
    "rather , we would like to know the time evolution at the instances @xmath99 .",

    "in contrast to the case of shaped pulses without spin - echo , there is no need for changing the phase @xmath98 of the second pulse or the sign of the coupling strength @xmath12 .",
    "the spin echo procedure is advantageous for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the gate becomes more robust against unequal light intensities on the ions .",
    "single qubit phases arising from light shifts are transformed into an unimportant global phase . in the context of this gate , light shifts",
    "will mainly be due to an imbalance in the power of the blue and the red - detuned laser beams and also due to very off - resonant excitation of dipole transitions .",
    "in addition , a light shift @xmath335 occurs if the average frequency @xmath36 of the bichromatic light field does not exactly coincide with the atomic transition frequency @xmath39 .",
    "however , this light shift will be fairly small as @xmath336 .",
    "collective spin flips arising from the term @xmath337 in ( [ heffzz ] ) can be cancelled to first order by choosing rotation axes for the @xmath313-pulses on ion 1 and ion 2 that differ by @xmath338 ( x - rotation on ion 1 and y - rotation on ion 2 ) .",
    "this effectively changes the sign of the rotation angle @xmath339 occurring in ( [ approxpropagatorzz ] ) for the second pulse and eliminates the spin flip contribution of the interaction . to perform different @xmath313-pulses on both ions requires , however , either a different trap frequency that changes the distance between the ions by @xmath340 or an additional laser beam .    in the limit of short gate operations , spin echos",
    "become somewhat less efficient in cancelling perturbations described by @xmath152 interactions as the gate interaction @xmath341 no longer commutes with @xmath152 for @xmath342 .    for the mlmer - srensen gate operation , where @xmath343 $ ] is not a small quantity , spin echos seem to be of limited use .",
    "if , however , the gate interaction is sandwiched between a pair of collective @xmath301 pulses to turn it into a @xmath0 interaction , spin echos are helpful for cancelling perturbations occurring between consecutive gates . also , it should be noted that a spin - echo like technique was already proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to cope with number - state dependent ac - stark shifts that arise if the gate is implemented by illuminating ion 1 with a red - detuned laser beam and ion 2 with a blue - detuned laser beam instead of using a bichromatic light field for both ions .",
    "collective laser - ion interactions with bichromatic laser beams are capable of performing both @xmath0 gates as well as mlmer - srensen gate operations .",
    "the analysis shows that it is important to include non - resonant excitation of the carrier transition for the precise calculation of the gate operation .",
    "while the paper was focused on the case of qubit states linked by a weak optical transition , the discussion of the mlmer - srensen gate interaction applies also to hyperfine qubits where non - resonant carrier excitation also occurs in the limit of fast gate operations . for optical qubits",
    ", the required laser beams can chosen to be co - propagating which allows for a robust and experimentally easily realizable setup where an acousto - optical modulator is used in single - pass configuration to create the bichromatic light field .",
    "in a direct comparison of the gates , the mlmer - srensen interaction seems to be advantageous in terms of required laser power and gate accuracy while the @xmath0 interaction has the advantage of being robust even against certain path length fluctuations occuring during the gate operation in the limit of weak driving where @xmath344 . for gate durations coming close to @xmath345 , control of the phase @xmath98 between the red- and the blue - detuned laser beams",
    "is of vital importance unless the gate is performed using amplitude - shaped laser pulses . in this case , the requirements are strongly relaxed and the gates appear to be very promising for experimental realization .",
    "the possibility of using a single laser beam for global single qubit and entangling operations opens also interesting perspectives for creating multi - particle entangled states with more than two ions .",
