    "adsorption of helium on a graphite substrate is still the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies ; although this subject is almost four decades old , it has lately been enjoying a resurgence of interest in connection with the study of a possible supersolid phase of matter .    due to the strong attraction to graphite , helium forms up to seven distinct layers above the substrate,@xcite each layer being a realization of a quasi - two dimensional system .",
    "several types of phases result from the interplay between the interaction among helium atoms , and their interaction with the substrate , including fluid , commensurate and incommensurate solid phases .",
    "crowell and reppy raised the possibility of a supersolid phase in the second layer , from the anomalous behavior of the period shift in torsional oscillator experiments.@xcite supersolids exhibit simultaneously crystalline order and frictionless flow in a single homogeneous phase , and have attracted increasing interest since the observation of nonclassical moment of inertia in solid @xmath0he by kim and chan.@xcite it has been proposed , based on a number of fundamental arguments , that a commensurate perfect single crystal of @xmath0he ought not be supersolid , @xcite a prediction supported by a number of computer simulations.@xcite however , a supersolid phase exists for bosonic models on a triangular lattice @xcite and one may thus speculate about the possibility of supersolids on substrates.@xcite    for the first adsorbed helium layer , there exist preferred adsorption sites , located above the centers of the hexagons formed by the carbon atoms on the graphite surface . a commensurate phase at filling @xmath1 , as well as an incommensurate solid phase are clearly observed in neutron diffraction experiments,@xcite heat capacity measurements , @xcite and in numerical simulations.@xcite the identification of the phases occurring between the two solids is still uncertain.@xcite several types of domain - wall phases have been predicted,@xcite but none unambiguously observed .",
    "the second layer is known to exhibit a gas , a superfluid and an incommensurate solid phase , as shown by heat capacity measurements @xcite and neutron diffraction experiments.@xcite at intermediate density between these two phases , greywall and busch conjectured a commensurate solid with a @xmath2 partial registry with respect to the first layer , based on their heat capacity measurements.@xcite at the same filling , a commensurate solid phase was observed in path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations;@xcite in that study , however , for computational convenience first layer particles were treated as classical , i.e. , held fixed in space at their @xmath3=0 equilibrium position . because of the relative weakness of the adsorption potential experienced by second layer atoms , it is plausible that the explicit inclusion of zero - point motion of first layer particles , possibly leading to a further weakening of the attraction , may qualitatively alter the picture",
    "moreover , no prediction has yet been made theoretically regarding the existence of a possible supersolid phase in the second layer .    in this paper , we study the low temperature phase diagram of the first and second layers of @xmath0he on graphite , by means of state - of - the - art computer simulations in which quantum zero - point motion of helium atoms in both the first and second layers is fully included .        our computed phase diagram is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : firstlayer ] . in the first layer",
    "we find a striped phase , a hexagonal domain - wall phase , and a hexagonal commensurate structure ( at filling 7/16 ) between the two crystals . in the second layer , we do not observe a commensurate solid phase,@xcite in contrast to the predictions by greywall and busch.@xcite rather , as coverage is increased the system goes through coexistence of liquid and gas phases , a ( superfluid ) liquid and an incommensurate crystal .",
    "we show that the commensurate phase observed in ref .",
    "is merely a consequence of a the neglect of zero - point motion of first layer @xmath0he  atoms , and that such a phase disappears if this approximation is removed , i.e. , if zero - point motion of first layer particles is included in the simulation . in _ no _ case is a supersolid phase of @xmath0he  observed , i.e. , including when a commensurate second layer solid phase is  artificially \" stabilized by holding first layer atoms at fixed positions , as done in ref . .",
    "not surprisingly , no supersolid phase occurs in _ incommensurate _ solid films , in analogy with what observed in three dimensions .    in the next section",
    "we briefly illustrate our model and computational methodology ; we then describe our results in detail , for the first and second layer .",
    "our computer simulations are based on the continuous - space worm algorithm.@xcite this methodology has proven remarkably effective in large - scale simulations of bose systems , owing to its efficiency in sampling multi - particle exchanges , which underlie phenomena such as bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity .",
    "the microscopic model utilized here is standard .",
    "specifically , we use the helium aziz interatomic potential,@xcite as well as the anisotropic 6 - 12 graphite - helium potential of carlos and cole,@xcite used in essentially all previous simulation work.@xcite such a potential accounts for the corrugation of the graphite substrate , a crucial ingredient to describe the variety of registered phases in the first layer .",
    "effects of the corrugation of the graphite substrate become negligible for successive adlayers ; for simulations of the second layer we have therefore utilized the laterally averaged version of the carlos - cole potential ( see also ref . ) .",
    "our model is fully three - dimensional , we use standard periodic boundary conditions , and simulate systems comprising up to 600 particles , at temperatures as low as 0.2 k , which is low enough to yield essentially ground state estimates .",
    "in the first layer we confirm the existence of a commensurate @xmath4 solid at coverage @xmath5 ( fig . [",

    "the film enters a domain - wall phase ( dw ) , with stripes of the @xmath4 solid separated by ( superheavy ) domain walls.@xcite    at even higher coverage , we observe a change from striped to hexagonal network of ( heavy ) domain walls .",
    "the possibility of a transition between these two domain - wall types was already raised by greywall.@xcite this network becomes denser with increasing coverage , ending with a commensurate solid ( @xmath6 ) for @xmath7 , where 7/16 of the adsorption sites are occupied .",

    "it need be stressed , however , that there is no significant _ numerical _ disagreement between our results and those of ref . .",
    "our different conclusion directly stems from the fact that , unlike pierce and manousakis , we did _ not _ keep first layer particles fixed , but rather simulated their zero - point motion explicitly .",
    "this fact alone accounts for ( most of ) the difference between the physical outcomes of the two studies .",
    "it is worth noting that the possible importance of the role of quantum fluctuations of inner layer particles had already been suggested by other authors.@xcite    the absence of a commensurate phase suggests that either the experimental data have to be reinterpreted , or the microscopic model adopted so far , chiefly the helium - graphite potential , might have to undergo significant revisions .",
    "we have studied this scenario to same length , in this work , notably by rendering the attractive well of the potential deeper . if the attraction is increased by some 10% ( while fully retaining in the simulation the zero - point motion of first layer @xmath0he  atoms ) a commensurate crystalline phase",
    "is observed _ only _ if a density of 0.127 @xmath9 is assumed for the first layer , i.e. , the value proposed by greywall and busch .",
    "this value is consistent with the first layer promotion density computed in this work with such a revised potential ( i.e. , 10% more attractive ) , _ only _ on assuming a compression of the inner adlayer of some 9% upon adsorption of successive layers .",
    "this degree of compression is substantially above that estimated by most experimental studies .    in any case , a revision of such a quantitative degree of the helium - graphite potential proposed by carlos and cole seems doubtful , in view of the good agreement with experimental data presented in ref . .",
    "finally , no finite superfluid signal is seen in any of the crystalline phases observed , either the incommensurate or the commensurate ( the latter , as explained above , merely occurs as the result of treating inner layer particles as fixed in the simulation ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that this system is no realistic candidate for the observation of a supersolid phase .",
