    "modeling emission from an optically - thin collisionally - ionized hot plasma has been an on - going problem in astrophysics ( cox & tucker 1969 ; cox & daltabuit 1971 ; mewe 1972 ; landini & monsignori fossi 1972 ; raymond & smith 1977 ; brickhouse , raymond & smith 1995 ) . over time , the codes used in these papers have been updated or completely rewritten ; current versions are the spexcode ( kaastra , mewe & nieuwenhuijzen 1996 ) and the chianti  code ( dere et al.1997 ; landi et al.1999 ) . the frequently used mekal  ( mewe - kaastra - liedahl ) code ( kaastra 1992 , liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein 1995 ) embedded in xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) uses data that are now in the spexcode ; its results are similar to spex .",
    "we describe here a new plasma emission code apec(atomic plasma emission code ) along with the atomic plasma emission database ( aped ) .",
    "our primary goal is to create plasma emission models that can be used to analyze data from the high resolution x - ray spectrometers on the _ chandra_and _ xmm - newton_telescopes . due to limitations on computer speed , memory size , and",
    "the available atomic data , early plasma codes included only the strongest emission lines from each ion , and `` bundled '' nearby lines , reporting only their summed emission at a single wavelength . in addition , the data were stored in the code itself , and could not be easily separated and studied .",
    "in contrast , we have strictly separated the atomic data from the code , storing the atomic data in fits format files , which collectively form aped .",
    "we have endeavored to maintain the data in apedas close as possible to the original form , for simplicity and ease in error checking .",
    "in addition , apedcontains error estimates for many wavelengths ; errors on other values in the database are in progress .",
    "currently , apedcontains data for well over a million lines , although many of these are too weak to be observed individually .",
    "an apeccalculation done at low electron density ( 1 @xmath2 ) , with cosmic abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) contains over 32,000 unique lines whose peak emissivities at temperatures between @xmath3k exceed @xmath4photons @xmath5s@xmath6 . although the literature of theoretical calculations for observable atomic transitions is far from complete , multiple calculations for some important rates do exist .",
    "apedcontains all the different datasets we have collected ( _ e.g. _  the entire chianti  v2.0 database ( landi et al.1999 ) , as well as the data referred to in this paper ) to allow easy comparison of different rates , and of the effect of different assumptions on the emissivities of selected lines . in a subsequent paper , we plan to present a complete overview of the data in apedand the emissivity tables over the x - ray range . here",
    "we discuss what effect changing the underlying atomic data has on hydrogen - like ( h - like ) and helium - like ( he - like ) oxygen ions .",
    "apeccalculates both line and continuum emissivities for a hot , optically - thin plasma which is in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "although apeccan calculate the ionization balance directly ( and thus handle non - equilibrium conditions ) , apeddoes not yet contain all the necessary ionization / recombination rates , so we use tabulated values for the ionization balance in thermal collisional equilibrium .",
    "we primarily use the ionization balance calculated by mazzotta et al.(1998 ; hereafter mm98 ) because it is a recent compilation that self - consistently treats all the astrophysically relevant ions .",
    "apeditself contains recombination ( radiative and dielectronic ) rate coefficients for oxygen .",
    "we combined these with the ionization rates from mm98 ) to create our own self - consistent ionization balance for these ions and found some small differences ( @xmath7% ; see figure  [ fig : lineratio](b ) ) .",
    "we do plan to include in apec / apeda self - consistent calculation of the ionization balance and level population in the future .",
    "since the term `` emissivity '' has a number of definitions , we give our definition explicitly .",
    "similar to the terminology of raymond & smith ( 1977 ) ( but in photon instead of energy units ) , the emissivity of a spectral line is the total number of radiative transitions per unit volume , divided by the product of the electron density @xmath8  and the hydrogen ( neutrals and protons ) density @xmath9 in the astrophysical plasma .",
    "the line emissivity therefore has units of photons @xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "since the number of photons emitted is actually proportional to the density of the ions involved , this definition implicitly requires an elemental abundance and ionization balance for the relevant ion to be specified .    for a given electron temperature @xmath10  and electron density @xmath8 ,",
    "the level populations for each ion are calculated from the collisional ( de-)excitation rate coefficients , the radiative transition rates , and the radiative and dielectronic recombination rate coefficients .",
    "excitation - autoionization processes have not yet been included in aped , but these are not significant for the h- and he - like ions in the equilibrium plasmas discussed here . for the h- and he - like isosequences , we have data for all singly - excited levels up to principal quantum number @xmath11  with the exception of , where we have data up to @xmath12 .    for the he - like ion ,",
    "the collisional excitation rate coefficients are from sampson , goett & clark ( 1983 ) , kato & nakazaki ( 1989 ) , and zhang & sampson ( 1987 ) for the levels up to @xmath11 , and from hullac ( bar - shalom , klapisch , & oreg 1988 ; klapisch et al.1977 ) calculations for @xmath0 .",
    "the radiative transition rates for @xmath13  are from topbase ( fernley , taylor & seaton 1987 ) , derevianko & johnson ( 1997 ) , lin , johnson , & dalgarno ( 1977 ) , and from the nist database ; for @xmath14 , the rates are again from hullac .",
    "the wavelengths are taken from drake ( 1988 ) .",
    "for the h - like ion , we use the collisional rate coefficients from sampson , goett & clark ( 1983 ) .",
    "we have also compared with scaled values from kisielius , berrington & norrington ( 1996 ) , but find few significant differences in the low - temperature region where the data overlap .",
    "the radiative transition rates are again from topbase and shapiro & breit ( 1959 ) for the two - photon ( @xmath15s@xmath16s@xmath17 ) rate .",
    "the wavelengths are from ericsson ( 1977 ) . for both ions",
    ", we use the dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficients and satellite line wavelengths from vainstein & safronova ( 1978 , 1980 ) for @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "we used data from safronova , vasilyev & smith ( 2001 ) .",
    "dielectronic recombination of into levels @xmath0of are from safronova ( 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "radiative recombination is calculated using the milne relation and the photoionization cross - sections of verner & yakovlev ( 1995 ) for the ground states and clark , cowan , & bobrowicz ( 1986 ) for the recombination to excited states .",
    "we choose these oxygen ions for our comparisons since they are relatively simple and have strong emission lines in many astrophysical plasmas .",
    "we will concentrate on two line ratios : for h - like ions , ly@xmath20(16.020)/ly@xmath21(18.987 ) , and for he - like ions , the frequently used @xmath22  ratio , where @xmath23  ( 22.098 ) is the forbidden transition @xmath24 , @xmath25  ( 21.804 , 21.801 ) is the sum of the two intercombination transitions @xmath26 , and @xmath27  ( 21.602 ) is the resonance transition @xmath28 . figure  [ fig : lineratio](a ) shows the h - like ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21line ratio from apec(with the mm98 ionization balance ) , spex1.1 , and raymond - smith . the mekal  results track those of spex1.1 , and so are not independently considered .",
    "we also did a `` pure - apec '' calculation where the ionization balance was found using recombination rate coefficients taken from aped",
    ". however , this did not affect the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio and so it is not shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineratio](b ) shows the he - like g ratio from the same calculations plus those of bautista & kallman ( 2000 ) and the pure - apeccalculation .",
    "the difference between the apec+mm98 and the pure - apeccalculation for , and the lack of a change in , can be understood in terms of the excitation mechanisms for the lines , as will be discussed below .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineratio ]  demonstrates two important points .",
    "first , near the peak emissivity of the emission lines , the code predictions agree to within 25% .",
    "second , substantial disagreements ( exceeding 50% ) exist even for these simple ions when they are not near peak emissivity .",
    "of course , comparing three theoretical models against each other does not provide an accurate estimate of the model error . for one limiting case",
    ", we can compare with analytic results . in figure",
    "[ fig : lineratio](a ) , the bethe limit of 0.14 [ photon units ] ( burgess & tully 1978 ) is also plotted ; this is the ratio of the electron collisional excitation rates in the high temperature limit , taking into account the branching ratio of ly@xmath20  from the @xmath29level . in the h - like case",
    ", this limit should be a good estimate of the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio since collisional excitation is the dominant method of populating excited levels .",
    "we calculate that cascades from collisional excitation to higher levels as well as radiative recombination contribute only @xmath30% of the direct rate to each line , somewhat more for ly@xmath20  than ly@xmath21 .",
    "since dielectronic recombination can not occur onto bare ions , it is not an issue .",
    "the agreement between the apecresult and the bethe limit is thus reassuring ; as expected , apecis slightly larger due to cascades and radiative recombination .",
    "this also explains why changing the ionization balance ( the pure - apeccase in figure  [ fig : lineratio](a ) ) does not affect the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio .",
    "both lines are primarily populated by direct collisions of electrons with , so small changes in the abundance cancel .",
    "some _ chandra_and _ xmm - newton_measurements of the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio from astrophysical plasmas already exist .",
    "the _ chandra_hetg observation of the rs cvn star ii  peg obtained a value of @xmath31  for this ratio ( huenemoerder 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "in addition , both _ chandra_hetg and _ xmm - newton_rgs observations of the oxygen - rich snr e0102 have been made , and although the extended nature of the source makes the analysis more difficult , the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio is measurable .",
    "chandra_hetg obtained @xmath32 ( davis et al.2001 ) , while the _ xmm - newton_rgs1 and rgs2 instruments obtained @xmath33  ( rasmussen et al.2001 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between these results is not yet understood .",
    "in addition , some laboratory measurements with the llnl ebit of oxygen ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  have been made .",
    "they find a range of values from 0.16 to 0.24 for electron energies above 1 kev ( gendreau 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "although the bethe limit of 0.14 for the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio is a good estimate if collisional excitation dominates the excitation , other effects could change the observed value .",
    "line blending , especially of  and  lines with o ly@xmath20 , can increase the apparent ly@xmath20  emission .",
    "pure radiative recombination also leads to a larger value of ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21 in h - like ions , similarly to the well - known effects on line ratios for he - like ions in photoionized plasmas ( porquet & dubau 2000 ; bautista & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "however , tests with apecshow that a plasma has to be nearly pure o@xmath34  for this to occur in a hot ( @xmath35k ) plasma .",
    "charge exchange into excited levels has been suggested by rasmussen et al.(2001 ) as a possible way of increasing the ratio in e0102 , but this requires mixing of neutral material directly into highly ionized regions ; furthermore , it is difficult to imagine how this could be occurring in ii  peg . finally , resonance scattering could also cause a change in the observed ratio , with the size and direction of the effect dependent on the spatial configuration of the plasma ( e.g. wood & raymond 2000 ) .    of course",
    ", the bethe limit is only applicable if the upper levels of both emission lines are populated by direct excitation from the ground state , and depopulated by radiative transitions . in the he - like  system ,",
    "other processes are more important than direct excitation at high temperatures for populating the @xmath36  level ( see figure  [ fig : excrate](b ) ) .",
    "the differences in the  g ratio among the codes at high temperature appear to be largely due to differences in the dielectronic recombination rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : excrate ] shows the level population mechanisms for the @xmath37  level ( which forms the resonance line ) and the  @xmath36  level ( which decays to the ground state as the forbidden line ) .",
    "the total excitation rates for these levels are equivalent to the line emissivities , since radiative decay to the ground state is the primary de - excitation process at low electron density for both levels . in figure",
    "[ fig : excrate](a ) , we see that direct excitation dominates all other mechanisms for populating the @xmath37  level .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : excrate](b ) shows that for the @xmath38  level , direct excitation is important only at low temperatures . at the peak emissivity ,",
    "the main excitation mechanism is cascades from higher levels .",
    "these higher levels are primarily populated by dielectronic recombination , which we have checked by comparing the computed rates for all the processes . as a result , the bethe limit can not be used as a check on the high - temperature limits of this he - like line ratio .",
    "this can also explain the difference between the apec+mm98 and pure - apeccalculations shown in figure  [ fig : lineratio](b ) . as a result of the different recombination rates ( @xmath39% variation ) , at temperatures above @xmath40k ,",
    "the pure - apeccode has a slightly larger population and slightly smaller population .",
    "thus the resonance line r emissivity ( which is proportional to the abundance ) is increased , while the f+i emission , due largely to dielectronic recombination from , is reduced .",
    "this leads overall to a small decrease in the g ratio .",
    "for the h- and he - like isosequences of ions with significant cosmic abundances ( c , n , o , ne , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni ) apedincludes atomic calculations for principal quantum numbers @xmath41 .",
    "we have tested the adequacy of this model by running apecrepeatedly using only the @xmath42 , @xmath18 , and the @xmath43  levels of , and find that , above the temperature of peak emissivity , our results are not convergent .",
    "we therefore obtained data for @xmath44 for ; the collisional excitation rate coefficients and radiative rates are from hullac and the dr satellite line data are from safronova ( 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "the g ratio for each model , with @xmath45  and 10 is shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] . clearly , the convergence including all @xmath46  is inadequate . by including all levels up to @xmath12  we converge to within the 10%-20% accuracy of the underlying atomic data . in the case of the @xmath47  ratio , which is sensitive to the electron density for @xmath48@xmath2 , fewer levels are required to reach convergence at @xmath49k , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ratio](b ) . at higher temperatures , such as @xmath50k ,",
    "the spread among models is slightly larger , but including only levels with @xmath41  is still adequate .",
    "this is the first in a sequence of papers on the new collection of atomic data apedand collisional plasma code apec . by separating the code and data",
    "we can more easily test the convergence of our models and compare atomic data from different sources .",
    "we have shown that , for , using newer atomic data leads to substantially different results in the high - temperature limit for the ly@xmath20/ly@xmath21  ratio , which agrees with some recent ebit measurements .",
    "in addition , for he - like ions , high-@xmath51  dielectronic recombination from the h - like ion can significantly affect the low-@xmath51  line ratio g. careful treatment of recombination to individual levels and cascades is necessary for other diagnostic line ratios ; _",
    "e.g. _ neon - like  ( liedahl 2000 ) .",
    "the methods described in this paper can be used to test the importance of such detailed treatment .",
    "furthermore , in cases where recombination and cascades contribute significantly to the level population , the accuracy of the ionization balance , not explicitly considered in this paper , will contribute to the total uncertainty in the model line ratio .",
