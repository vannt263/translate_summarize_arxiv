    "recently , there has been an upsurge of research interests in radio frequency ( rf ) energy harvesting / scavenging technique ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , or rf harvesting in short , which is the capability of converting the received rf signals into electricity .",
    "this technique becomes a promising solution to power energy - constrained wireless networks .",
    "conventionally , the energy - constrained wireless networks , such as wireless sensor networks , have a limited lifetime which largely confines the network performance . in contrast",
    ", an rf energy harvesting network ( rf - ehn ) has a sustainable power supply from a radio environment .",
    "therefore , the rf energy harvesting capability allows the wireless devices to harvest energy from rf signals for their information processing and transmission .",
    "consequently , rf - ehns have found their applications quickly in various forms , such as wireless sensor networks  @xcite , wireless body networks  @xcite , and wireless charging systems . with the increasingly emerging applications of rf energy harvesting / charging",
    ", the wireless power consortium is also making the efforts of establishing an international standard for the rf energy harvesting technique .    in rf energy harvesting ,",
    "radio signals with frequency range from 300ghz to as low as 3khz are used as a medium to carry energy in a form of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "rf energy transfer and harvesting is one of the wireless energy transfer techniques .",
    "the other techniques are inductive coupling and magnetic resonance coupling .",
    "inductive coupling  @xcite is based on magnetic coupling that delivers electrical energy between two coils tuned to resonate at the same frequency .",
    "the electric power is carried through the magnetic field between two coils .",
    "magnetic resonance coupling  @xcite utilizes evanescent - wave coupling to generate and transfer electrical energy between two resonators .",
    "the resonator is formed by adding a capacitance on an induction coil . both of the above two techniques are near - field wireless transmission featured with high power density and conversion efficiency .",
    "the power transmission efficiency depends on the coupling coefficient , which depends on the distance between two coils / resonators .",
    "the power strength is attenuated according to the cube of the reciprocal of the distance @xcite , specifically , 60 db per decade of the distance , which results in limited power transfer distance .",
    "besides , both inductive coupling and resonance coupling require calibration and alignment of coils / resonators at transmitters and receivers . therefore , they are not suitable for mobile and remote replenishment / charging .",
    "in contrast , rf energy transfer has no such limitation .",
    "as the radiative electromagnetic wave can not retroact upon the antenna that generated it ( by capacitive or inductive coupling ) at a distance of above @xmath0 @xcite , rf energy transfer can be regarded as a far - field energy transfer technique .",
    "thus , rf energy transfer is suitable for powering a larger number of devices distributed in a wide area .",
    "the signal strength of far - field rf transmission is attenuated according to the reciprocal of the distance between transmitter and receiver , specifically , 20 db per decade of the distance .",
    "table  [ wet ] shows the comparison between the three major wireless energy transfer techniques .",
    "we can see that rf energy transfer technique has clear advantages in effective energy transfer distance . however , it has low rf - to - dc energy conversion efficiency especially when the harvested rf power is small",
    ". the readers can refer to @xcite for more detailed introduction of wireless energy transfer techniques . in this article ,",
    "we focus on wireless networks with the rf energy harvesting technique .",
    "wireless power transfer has caught research attention since long ago , as a separate problem with wireless information transmission .",
    "traditionally , free - space beaming and antennas with large apertures were used to overcome propagation loss for large power transfer .",
    "for example , in 1960 s , the authors in @xcite demonstrate a small helicopter hovering at an height of 50-feet , powered by an rf source with a dc power supply of 270w operating on 2.45ghz on the ground . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors demonstrate a space - to - earth power transfer system using gigantic transmit antenna arrays at a satellite and receive antenna arrays at a ground station . for transmit power of 2.7gw",
    ", the power transfer efficiency is estimated to be @xmath1 over a transfer distance of @xmath2 . during the past decade , with the development in rf energy harvesting circuit , low power transfer for powering mobile terminals in wireless communication systems began to attract increasing attention @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite propose a network architecture for rf charging stations , overlaying with an uplink cellular network . in @xcite ,",
    "a harvest - then - transmit protocol is introduced for power transfer in wireless broadcast system . moreover ,",
    "various modern beamforming techniques are employed to improve power transfer efficiency @xcite for mobile applications .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "table  [ routing ] shows the comparison of the existing routing protocols for rf - ehns .",
    "it can be observed that all the protocols work in the systems with a dedicated rf charger , because of which the majority of them consider out - of - band charging to avoid interference .",
    "though in @xcite , the authors perform an experiment of the system where a sensor node and rf charger work on the same frequency , no interference management scheme is taken into account .",
    "therefore , this is a room for the investigation of routing protocols in the system adopting swipt .    furthermore , given the routing metric , information exchange among the network devices through broadcasting",
    "is required during route selection . due to hardware limitation as aforementioned",
    ", network devices can not harvest rf energy from the same carrier for information decoding . as a result",
    ", the network devices working in rf harvesting mode may miss the broadcast information .",
    "thus , an efficient message broadcasting mechanism for the time - switching based receiver architecture is also required for routing protocols .",
    "besides , an rf - ehn operates on ism band ( e.g. , wifi , zigbee and bluetooth ) may overlap with the frequency band for wireless charging ( e.g. , the system in @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "an rf charger , if not well controlled , can cause severe interference to the network communication , as its power is usually much higher than that of network devices .",
    "thus , there is a need for efficient spectrum allocation mechanisms to coordinate communication and charging .",
    "in this section , we discuss about open research issues .",
    "distributed energy beamforming enables a cluster of distributed energy sources to cooperatively emulate an antenna array by transmitting rf energy simultaneously in the same direction to an intended energy harvester for better diversity gains .",
    "the potential energy gains at the receiver from distributed energy beamforming are expected to be the same as that from the well - known information beamforming .",
    "however , challenges arise in the implementation , e.g. , time synchronization among energy sources and coordination of distributed carriers in phase and frequency so that rf signals can be combined constructively at the receiver .      existing interference management techniques , e.g. , interference alignment and interference cancellation , attempt to avoid or mitigate interference through spectrum scheduling .",
    "however , with rf energy harvesting , harmful interference can be turned into useful energy through a scheduling policy . in this context , how to mitigate interference as well as facilitate energy transfer , which may be conflicting , is the problem to be addressed .",
    "furthermore , the scheduling policy can be combined with power management schemes for further improvement in energy efficiency .      in rf - ehns ,",
    "rf energy becomes a valuable resource .",
    "the rf energy market can be established to economically manage this energy resource jointly with radio resource .",
    "for example , wireless charging service providers may act as rf energy suppliers to meet the energy demand from network nodes .",
    "the wireless energy service providers can decide on pricing and guarantee the quality of charging service .",
    "one of the efficient approaches in this dynamic market is to develop demand side management , which allows the service providers and network nodes to interact like in smart grid , to guarantee energy - efficiency and reliability .",
    "however , the issues related to the amount of rf energy and price at which they are willing to trade while optimizing the tradeoff between the revenue and cost must be investigated .      network nodes , rf sources , and information gateway can be mobile . therefore , mobility becomes an important factor for rf energy harvesting and information transmission .",
    "the major issue is due to the fact that the energy harvesting and information transmission performances become time - varying , and resource allocation has to be dynamic and adaptive .    a recent work @xcite investigates the impact of mobile rf source under two different mobility models , namely _ center - to - center mobility ( cm ) model _ and _ around edges moving ( em ) model _ with the focus on the energy gain at receivers .",
    "the tradeoff between transmit power and distance is explored , taking the energy loss during movement into account .",
    "it is found that cm yields better network performance in small networks with high node density .",
    "by contrast , em yields better performance in large networks with low node density .",
    "network coding @xcite is well - known to be energy efficient in information transmission . with network coding , senders",
    "are allowed to transmit information simultaneously .",
    "this property , especially in large - scale network , increases the amount of rf energy that can be harvested . during the time slots when relays or senders are not transmitting",
    ", they can harvest ambient rf signals .",
    "a pioneer study in @xcite analyzes the network lifetime gain for a two - way relay network with network coding .",
    "it is found that the lifetime of the network can be increased up to @xmath3 by enabling rf energy harvesting . from the perspective of network lifetime ,",
    "more diverse network models and network coding schemes , such as physical - layer network coding and analogy network coding , are worth to be explored .",
    "additionally , the energy gain of network coding has been proved to be upper bounded by @xmath4 in the literature .",
    "intuitively , taking advantage of the broadcast nature of rf signals to reuse some of the dissipated energy can lead to energy saving .",
    "however , theoretically , whether rf energy harvesting will increase the upper bound of energy gain or not and how much exactly the bound will increase still require further investigation .",
    "it has long been recognized that intense rf exposure can cause heating of materials with finite conductivity , including biological tissues @xcite .",
    "the studies in @xcite focus on the effects of electromagnetic waves particularly from mobile phones and cellular networks . most of the measurements conclude that rf exposure from radio communication is safe .",
    "however , investigations in @xcite and @xcite show that some effects to genes are noticed when the rf power reaches the upper bound of international security levels .",
    "although there are many existing studies on the health risks of mobile phones , little effort has been made for investigation on health effect caused by a dedicated rf charger , which can release much higher power .",
    "thus , there is a need to address the safety concerns on deploying rf chargers .      *",
    "due to the inverse - square law that the power density of rf waves decreases proportionally to the inverse of the square of the propagation distance , practical rf energy transfer and harvesting that complies to fcc regulations is limited to a local area .",
    "for example , the fcc allows operation up to 4w equivalent isotropically radiated power .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , to realize 5.5@xmath5w energy transfer rate with a 4w power source , only the distance of 15 meters is possible . *",
    "other than transfer distance , rf energy harvesting rate is also largely affected by the direction and gain of the receive antenna(s ) .",
    "therefore , to improve the energy harvesting efficiency , devising a high gain antenna ( e.g. , based on materials and geometry ) for a wide range of frequency is an important research issue .",
    "* impedance mismatching occurs when the input resistance and reactance of the rectifier do not equal to that of the antenna . in this context",
    ", the antenna is not able to deliver all the harvested power to the rectifier .",
    "thus , impedance variations ( e.g. , introduced by on - body antennas ) can severely degrade the energy conversion efficiency .",
    "there is a need to develop circuit design techniques that automatically tune the parameters to minimize impedance mismatch .",
    "* the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency depends on the density of harvested rf power .",
    "improving the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency at low harvested power input is important . moreover , realizing a high - efficient low - power dc - to - dc converter , which converts a source of dc from a voltage level to another , would be another effort to achieve highly efficient rf energy harvesting . *",
    "rf energy harvesting components need to be small enough to be embedded in low - power devices . for example , the size of an rf - powered sensor should be smaller than or comparable to that of a battery - power sensor .",
    "as introduced above , an rf energy harvesting component may require an independent antenna , matching network and rectifier .",
    "the antenna size has a crucial impact on an energy harvesting rate .",
    "additionally , high voltage at the output of a rectifier requires very high impedance loads ( e.g. , 5m@xmath6 ) , which is a function of the length of the impedance .",
    "thus , it is challenging to reduce the size of embedded devices while maintaining high energy harvesting efficiency . * without line - of - sight for rf waves from an rf source to an energy harvester , the considerable energy transfer loss is expected .",
    "therefore , the rf energy source must be optimally placed to support multiple receivers to be charged . moreover , in a mobile environment , the mobility of receivers and energy sources can affect the rf energy transfer significantly . *",
    "the sensitivity of an information receiver is typically much higher than that of an rf energy harvester .",
    "consequently , a receiver located at a distance away from an rf transmitter may be able only to decode information and fail to extract energy from the rf signals . in this case",
    ", any swipt scheme can not be used efficiently .",
    "therefore , improving the sensitivity of rf energy harvesting circuit is crucial . * for rf - powered devices ,",
    "as the transmit power is typical low , multiple antennas can be adopted to improve the transmission efficiency .",
    "however , larger power consumption comes along when the number of antennas increases .",
    "thus , there exists a tradeoff between the transmission efficiency and power consumption .",
    "the scheme to optimize this tradeoff needs to be developed .",
    "this issue becomes more complicated in a dynamic environment , e.g. , with varying energy harvesting rate .",
    "* as rf - powered devices typically have a strict operation power constraint , it is not practical to support high computation algorithms .",
    "any schemes , such as modulation and coding , receiver operation policy and routing protocol , to be adopted need to be energy - efficient and low - power .",
    "hence , power consumption is always a serious concern in rf - powered devices , which may require the re - design of existing schemes and algorithms for conventional networks .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive survey on rf energy harvesting networks ( rf - ehns ) .",
    "firstly , we have provided an overview of rf - ehns with the focus on architecture , enabling techniques and existing applications .",
    "then , we have reviewed the background in circuit design and state - of - the - art circuitry implementations .",
    "afterwards , we have surveyed various design issues related to resource allocation in rf - ehns , and the up - to - date solutions . finally , we have discussed on the future directions and practical challenges in rf energy harvesting techniques .",
