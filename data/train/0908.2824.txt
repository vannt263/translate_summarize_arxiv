    "a trapped ion system is expected to be a promising candidate for developing quantum computers @xcite .",
    "recently , the experimental development of trapped ions has undergone a significant technical advancement @xcite .",
    "in addition , this technology has been applied to quantum teleportation @xcite  and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the successful application of trapped ion systems to the abovementioned tasks proves that these systems have a great potential for use in other fascinating quantum tasks , which have not yet been experimentally executed . in this study , we analyse quantum energy teleportation with cold ions in a linear trap , that is , a linear ion crystal .",
    "recently , quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) has been proposed @xcite-@xcite ; this protocol is able to transport energy simply by local operations and classical communication .",
    "energy can be effectively teleported without breaking any physical laws including causality and local energy conservation by measuring zero - point oscillation at one site in the entangled ground state of a many - body quantum system and providing the measurement result to distant sites .",
    "the key point is that there exists quantum correlation between local fluctuations of different sites in the ground state .",
    "therefore , the measurement result of local fluctuation in some site includes information about fluctuation in other sites . by selecting and performing a suitable local operation based on the transferred information ,",
    "the zero - point oscillation of a site away from the measurement site can be more suppressed than that of the ground state , yielding negative energy density . here",
    ", the origin of energy density is fixed such that the expectation value vanishes for the ground state .",
    "it is well known that such regions with negative energy density are created by superposing energy eigenstates quantum mechanically . even if a system comprises a region with negative energy density ,",
    "other regions with positive energy density still exist , and therefore , the total energy of the system remains non - negative .",
    "discussions on negative energy density of non - relativistic systems are given in @xcite and those for negative energy density of relativistic systems are given in @xcite . while performing the above local operation to create negative energy density in the system , the surplus energy is transferred from quantum fluctuations to external systems and can be harnessed .",
    "though the protocols of energy teleportation can be implemented for other systems such as quantum fields @xcite and spin chains @xcite , linear ion crystals can be effectively used for qet . due to the coulomb interaction and the harmonic potential for linear trapping , the ions interact with each other so strongly that entanglement for energy teleportation is easily generated in the phonon ground state .",
    "it is also possible to povm measure the local fluctuation of phonons in the linear ion crystal by coupling the phonon modes with the internal energy levels of each ion via a laser field @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we use the linear trap models that are extensively analysed by james @xcite and consider a protocol of qet . in",
    "what follows , @xmath0 cold ions , which are strongly bound in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions but weakly bound in a harmonic potential in the @xmath3 direction , form a linear ion crystal called the qet channel .",
    "the first ion that stays at the left edge of the crystal is the gateway of the qet channel where energy is input .",
    "the @xmath0-th ion that stays at the right edge of the crystal is the exit of the qet channel where the teleported energy is output .",
    "we select two suitable internal energy levels of the gateway ion and regard them as the energy levels of a probe qubit in order to measure the local phonon fluctuation .",
    "the probe qubit is strongly coupled with the phonon fluctuation in the ground state for a short period of time via a laser field , and it is projectively measured in order to obtain 1-bit information about phonon fluctuation . during the measurement process at the gateway , phonons are excited in the system by the time - dependent measurement interaction , and hence , the energy of the excited phonons must be infused from outside the system . in the measurement models used in this study , the kinetic energy of the gateway ion increases after the measurement ; however , the kinetic energy of other ions and the potential energy of all the ions remain unchanged . this infusion of energy is regarded as energy input at the gateway of the qet channel .",
    "the obtained information is transferred through a classical channel from the gateway point to the exit point . in principle , the speed at which this information is transferred is equal to the speed of light , which is considerably greater than that of phonon propagation  in the ion crystal . it is emphasized that even when the phonons excited at the qet gateway do not arrive at the exit point , the information still arrives at the exit point . because the measurement process at the gateway is local , the state of the exit ion before the phonons arrive is locally the same as the ground state .",
    "surprisingly , however , we are able to soon extract energy from the exit ion by using the transferred information .",
    "performing a local operation that depends on the measurement result suppresses the zero - point oscillation of the phonon fluctuation at the exit ion , yielding negative energy density around the exit .",
    "the surplus energy of the fluctuation is transferred from the phonon system to the external systems including the device , in order to perform this operation . here , it should also be emphasized that without the measurement result , we can not extract energy from the exit ion in the local ground state by performing an arbitrary local quantum operation on the ion . because the intermediate ions of the crystal are not excited during the protocol execution , this qet ensures energy transportation in the channel without the generation of heat .",
    "the non - negativity of the total hamiltonian of phonons ensures that the amount of the teleported energy is less than the amount of the input energy .",
    "the amount of energy required for transferring the information is negligibly small in principle as compared to the amount of the teleported energy , because the information can be simply transported by low - energy physical carriers such as electromagnetic waves with long wavelengths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , the linear ion crystal model developed by james",
    "@xcite is reviewed . in section 3 ,",

    "<S> we analyse a protocol of quantum energy teleportation that transports energy from the left edge of a linear ion crystal to the right edge by local operations and classical communication at a speed considerably greater than the speed of a phonon in the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> a probe qubit is strongly coupled with phonon fluctuation in the ground state for a short time , and it is projectively measured in order to obtain information about this phonon fluctuation . during the measurement process , phonons are excited by the time - dependent measurement interaction , and the energy of the excited phonons must be infused from outside the system . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained information is transferred to the right edge of the crystal through a classical channel . </S>",
    "<S> even though the phonons excited at the left edge do not arrive at the right edge at the same time as when the information arrives at the right edge , we are able to soon extract energy from the ions at the right edge by using the transferred information . </S>",
    "<S> because the intermediate ions of the crystal are not excited during the execution of the protocol , energy is transmitted in the energy transfer channel without heat generation .     </S>",
