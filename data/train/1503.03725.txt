    "the external potential is taken to be a harmonic oscillator , @xmath159 . finally , @xmath160 is the 3d dirac delta - function .",
    "this hamiltonian describes a weakly - interacting system meaning that the @xmath161-wave scattering length is much smaller than the average distance between atoms . to obtain the gpe we assume that the total wave - function @xmath162 of the system of @xmath10 bosons is a product of single - particle functions @xmath163 , @xmath164 which minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian . to satisfy this requirement the single - particle wave - function @xmath165 ,",
    "should solve the gpe , @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the chemical potential .",
    "the chemical potential appears in the equation as a lagrange multiplier from the normalization condition for the wave function , i.e. @xmath168 . to simulate one - dimensional geometry",
    "experimentally one confines a system by a potential with two frequencies that are much larger than the third . at very low temperature",
    "this means that any two atoms outside of the interaction range move effectively in 1d . having this in mind we scale the gpe using the units given by the frequency of weak confinement : @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath171 , such that @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",

    "this means that the time evolution does not cause excitations along the @xmath17- and @xmath176-axis , since these require much more energy than the excitations along the @xmath18-axis , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "<S> the coupling terms in this system correspond to the transition of a majority particle from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . for bosons , this is a coherent process which contributes significantly if the impurity is placed in a region with high density of majority particles . </S>",
    "<S> physical intuition , however , tells us that in the ground and low - lying excited states the impurity is pushed to the edge of the trap if @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the impurity would deplete the majority particles notably from the ground state of the one - body harmonic oscillator which is very expensive energywise for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for large @xmath10 we neglect the coupling terms between different @xmath48 , which rigorously gives us an upper bound for the exact energy of the ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect this approximation to be very accurate also for low - lying excited states . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our model yields results that are slightly above the numerically exact values with a maximum deviation of a few percent . </S>",

    "<S> this derivative for fixed @xmath7 determines the probability for a given boson to be close to the impurity @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however now we allow weak interaction between the bosons as well as different mass ( or frequency ) ratios . for large interactions this setup is already beyond current numerical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we stress once again that in our method the numerical complexity does not increase with @xmath10 , and @xmath62 is chosen as a particular example .    </S>",
    "<S> first we fix @xmath66 and change the intra - species interaction strength , @xmath8 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*c ) * and * d ) * we show the density for the impurity and majority atoms in the ground state . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the energy is minimized if the impurity is pushed towards the middle of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> this is readily understood for the case @xmath67 where the impurity particle should have the same density distribution due to the boson - impurity exchange symmetry of the hamiltonian . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the densities of majority and impurity for @xmath68 is due to the different treatments of these components . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that we expect the gpe and our approach to yield only qualitative results for such a large boson - boson interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noticing that if both interactions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are very large one can approach the problem directly using the bose - fermi mapping @xcite , where one also expects enhancement of the impurity density in the middle of the trap compared to the @xmath31 case . </S>",

    "<S> this quantity is related to the orthogonality catastrophe @xcite and has generated recent interest as a probe of many - body physics with cold atoms @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we see a power - law behavior , but more interestingly , the exponent changes with both @xmath8 and mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the overlaps remain finite for finite system sizes and only goes to zero for @xmath73 @xcite . the original work of anderson @xcite uses a potential to model the impurity which corresponds to the limit @xmath72 . consistent with anderson </S>",

    "<S> [ fig5 ] . on the contrary , in the opposite limit of equal masses we see much longer tails . </S>",
