    "solid molecular hydrogen has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical study over the years",
    ". however , the properties of bulk isotopic equivalents ( like hd or d@xmath0 ) were not investigated in comparable detail .",
    "it is a common practice to describe molecules of para - hydrogen and isotopic equivalents as point particles interacting via a model potential which in some case includes terms which effectively account for three  body interactions , which are expected to be not negligible in these systems .",
    "the popular silvera  goldman ( sg)@xcite potential , which includes a @xmath1 term which mimicks a triple  dipole interaction , and the buck@xcite potential , which is instead a pure two  body interaction , have been employed indifferently in theoretical works about p - h@xmath0 , while in the case of o - d@xmath0  only the first one has been commonly used .",
    "however , in the case of p - h@xmath0 , we recently discovered by means of accurate quantum monte carlo simulations that an explicit three - body term is necessary in order to correctly reproduce experimental data on pressure@xcite , .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate if the different mass plays a role in determining the necessity of including an explicit three - body force in the description of o - d@xmath0 . as already mentioned , both the buck and the sg interactions are isotropic and therefore either completely neglect , or treat in an effective way the possible three body interactions acting among the molecules .",
    "this commonly used approximation is in principle justified by the fact that at t=0k the molecules of hydrogen and deuterium are considered to be in their rotational ground - state ( j=0 ) and therefore the average interaction must have spherical symmetry .",
    "three body interactions should therefore be a second order effect .    in this work we present the results of a systematic study of the equation of state of solid o - d@xmath0  for pressures ranging from 0 ( and slightly below ) up",
    "to 350mpa performed by means of the diffusion monte carlo algorithm , which gives for many bosons the exact eigenvalue of the system , depending only on the chosen hamiltonian .",
    "we compared the results of our simulations with the experimental measurements of the pressure .",
    "only the sg potential is found to be capable to give a satisfactory description of the pressure  volume curve in the studied range of density .",
    "we can safely attribute this result to the presence in the potential of the repulsive extra - term which treats in an effective way the possible three body interactions acting among the molecules .",
    "the next section of the paper will describe the methods used in our analysis .",
    "section iii will present the results on energies , pressures and and other ground state properties in o - d@xmath0 .",

    "we model a system of solid o - d@xmath0  as a set of @xmath2  point particles described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4  stands for the @xmath5  coordinates of the molecules and @xmath6  is the intermolecular potential .",

    "the computed estimate is exact at order @xmath27 and the results are are largely independent of the choice of the trial wave function .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath28 has be variationally optimized , in order to reduce the variance on the estimate of the eigenvalue in the dmc calculation .",

    "the possibility of neglecting the symmetrization under exchange of molecules in the trial wavefunction has been already discussed in the case of solid p - h@xmath0@xcite , justifing this ansatz also for solid o - d@xmath0  which is expected to be even more localized than and p - h@xmath0 .",

    "for each density studied , dmc calculations have been performed projecting from the optimized trial function @xmath28 using different imaginary time - steps and populations of walkers , in order to check that the bias due to the use of a finite time - step and a limited number of walkers were both negligible compared to statistical errors affecting the results of the simulations . as well as the ground state energy ,",
