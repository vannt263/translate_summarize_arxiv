    "in the present paper , we initiate the study of intertwining operators among twisted modules associated to not - necessarily - commutative automorphisms of a vertex operator algebra . here by twisted modules we mean ( generalized or logarithmic ) twisted modules introduced in @xcite . for simplicity and to avoid confusion , when twisted modules are not mentioned , we shall call such intertwining operators `` twisted intertwining operators , '' although these intertwining operators are not twisted directly , but are twisted instead in a suitable sense through twisted modules .    intertwining operators among ( untwisted ) modules for a vertex operator algebra were first introduced mathematically by frenkel , lepowsky and the author in @xcite and correspond to chiral vertex operators in physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they have been studied systematically in the papers @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite .",
    "intertwining operators give chiral three - point correlation functions in two - dimensional conformal field theories and are the building blocks of multi - point correlation functions on riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus .",
    "they are the main objects of interest in the representation theory of vertex operator algebras and two - dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "almost all important results in these theories are in fact properties of intertwining operators .    intertwining operators among twisted modules associated to commutative automorphisms of finite orders appeared implicitly in the work @xcite of feingold , frenkel and ries and were introduced explicitly by xu in @xcite in terms of a generalization of the jacobi identity for twisted modules . however , there is still no definition of intertwining operators among twisted modules associated to noncommutative automorphisms in the literature . to construct orbifold conformal field theories",
    "associated to a noncommutative group of automorphisms of a vertex operator algebra , it is necessary to study these intertwining operators .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author formulated the following conjecture :    [ twisted - int - op ] assume that @xmath0 is a simple vertex operator algebra satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 for @xmath11 and the contragredient @xmath12 , as a @xmath0-module , is equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "every grading - restricted generalized @xmath0-module is completely reducible 3 .",
    "@xmath0 is @xmath13-cofinite , that is , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the subspace of @xmath0 spanned by the elements of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] is the vertex operator map for @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a finite group of automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "then the twisted intertwining operators among the @xmath20-twisted @xmath0-modules for all @xmath21 satisfy the associativity , commutativity and modular invariance properties .",
    "if this conjecture is proved , then we obtain the genus - zero and genus - one parts of the chiral orbifold conformal field theory associated with the vertex operator algebra @xmath0 and the group @xmath19 of automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "one consequence of conjecture [ twisted - int - op ] is that the category of @xmath20-twisted modules for all all @xmath21 has a natural structure of @xmath19-crossed braided tensor category satisfying additional properties .    to even formulate this conjecture precisely , we have to first introduce twisted intertwining operators or intertwining operators among twisted modules associated to general automorphisms and study their basic properties . in this paper",
    ", we give a definition of such twisted intertwining operators .",
    "let @xmath0 be a vertex operator algebra and let @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 be automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "we prove that for @xmath1- , @xmath2- and @xmath3-twisted @xmath0-modules @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , such that the vertex operator map for @xmath6 is injective , if there exists a twisted intertwining operator of type @xmath7 such that the images of its component operators span @xmath6 , then @xmath8 .",
    "we also construct what we call the skew - symmetry and contragredient isomorphisms between spaces of twisted intertwining operators among twisted modules of suitable types .",
    "the proofs of these results are much more subtle and delicate than those for the corresponding results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite because they involve careful analysis of the analytic extensions corresponding to the actions of the not - necessarily - commutative automorphisms of the vertex operator algebra .",
    "the motivation for the study of twisted intertwining operators does not just come from orbifold conformal field theories and their potential applications in geometry and physics .",
    "it in fact also comes intrinsically from the study of the uniqueness conjecture of the moonshine module vertex operator algebra proposed by frenkel , lepowsky and meurman @xcite .",
    "this conjecture was obtained by using the analogy among the golay code , the leech lattice and the moonshine module vertex operator algebra . in conway s proof of the uniqueness of the leech lattice",
    "@xcite , the @xmath22-dimensional vector space @xmath23 plays a fundamental role . for the uniqueness conjecture for the moonshine module vertex operator algebra ,",
    "the first difficulty is that there is no analogue of @xmath23 .",
    "but we still need a structure large enough such that all the works can be done in this structure .    if the vertex operator subalgebra fixed by the automorphism group of a vertex operator algebra satisfy suitable conditions ( for example , the three conditions in conjecture [ twisted - int - op ] ) , then one possible choice of such a structure large enough for our purpose is the intertwining operator algebra formed by the modules and intertwining operators for the fixed - point vertex operator subalgebra .",
    "however , the assumption that these suitable conditions hold is in fact a main difficult conjecture that we have to prove first . because of this , instead of assuming these conditions , we have to develop a theory that will lead us to a proof of these conditions and a construction of the intertwining operator algebra .",
    "since in this area , conjectures are sometimes claimed to have been proved in some books , papers , preprints or unpublished manuscripts without the evidence that the proofs indeed exist , the author would like to comment that the mathematics for obtaining conjectures and the mathematics for finding proofs are often very different . to obtain conjectures",
    ", one can assume what one believes to be true and derive the consequences .",
    "but to prove conjectures , the assumptions used to derive the conjectures are often themselves the most difficult parts of the conjectures .",
    "thus one might need different mathematical approaches and theories to prove these assumptions first .",
    "the theory of twisted intertwining operators initiated in this paper is what the author believes to be needed in the proofs of the conjectures mentioned above , including conjecture [ twisted - int - op ] and the conjecture that suitable conditions hold for the fixed - point vertex operator subalgebra .",
    "we expect that this theory will play an important role in the study of orbifold conformal field theory and , in particular , in the study of the uniqueness conjecture of the moonshine module vertex operator algebra .    in this paper",
    ", we use the approach based on multivalued analytic functions with preferred branches developed and used in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite .",
    "intertwining operators among ( untwisted ) modules can be defined using either such multivalued analytic functions or formal variables . but to study products and iterates of intertwining operators , it is necessary to use the approach based on such multivalued analytic functions . for twisted intertwining operators introduced and studied in this paper , even for the definition and the properties involving only one twisted intertwining operator , we need the approach based on such multivalued analytic functions , because the vertex operators for twisted modules contain nonintegral powers and logarithm of the variable and , more importantly , because the automorphisms associated to different twisted modules are not necessarily commutative .    in section 2 , we discuss the notations and conventions used in this paper , especially those involving multivalued analytic functions with preferred branches . in section 3 ,",
    "we recall the notion of twisted module introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss in this section the functors associated to automorphisms of the vertex operator algebra and the contragredient functor on the category of twisted modules .",
    "twisted intertwining operators are introduced in section 4 . in the same section",

    "the skew - symmetry isomorphisms and contragredient isomorphisms are constructed in section 5 and section 6 , respectively .",
    "to study intertwining operators , we have to work with multivalued analytic functions with preferred branches .",

    "note that the left - hand side of ( [ a-11 ] ) is a series in ( complex ) powers of @xmath483 and @xmath306 and in nonnegative integral powers of @xmath453 and @xmath308 with finitely many negative powers in @xmath483 and finitely many positive powers of @xmath306 . since @xmath481 can be expanded uniquely as such a series in the region @xmath161 , the left - hand side of ( [ a-11 ] ) must be absolutely convergent when @xmath161 and if in addition , @xmath480 , its sum is equal to @xmath481 .",
