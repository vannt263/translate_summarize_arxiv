    "the absorption spectrum of a weak probe , interacting with a pumped nearly - degenerate two - level transition , can exhibit either a sharp subnatural dip or peak at line center @xcite , depending on the degeneracy of the levels , the polarizations of the fields , and the absence or presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "the phenomenon is termed electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite when there is a dip in the probe spectrum and electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) @xcite when there is a peak .    in the case of orthogonal polarizations of the pump and probe ,",
    "both eit and eia are related to the ground - level zeeman coherence , which is induced by the simultaneous action of both fields .",
    "the simplest model system that exhibits eit is the three - level @xmath1 system , where the two lower states @xmath2 are zeeman sublevels of the ground hyperfine level @xmath3 . in a @xmath1 system",
    ", quantum coherence can lead to the destructive interference between the two possible paths of excitation . as a result , if the pump field is tuned to resonance , the narrow dip in the probe absorption spectrum at the two - photon resonance can be interpreted as eit caused by a coherent population trapping @xcite in the lower levels .",

    "the @xmath0 system gives similar results to those obtained for a closed alkali - metal @xmath9 transition interacting with a @xmath10 polarized pump , and a weak @xmath11 polarized probe @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that the eia peak is due to transfer of coherence ( toc ) from the excited state to the ground state , via spontaneous emission .",
    "the excited - state coherence only exists in systems where the coherent population trapping is incomplete so that there is some population in the excited state @xcite .",
    "the transfer of this coherence to the ground state leads to a peak in the contribution of the ground - state two - photon coherence to the probe absorption at line center , instead of the dip that occurs in its absence ( for example , in a @xmath1 system or a non - degenerate @xmath0 system ) @xcite .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    in this paper , we investigate the effect of the thermal motion of the alkali - metal gas on the eia spectrum , in the presence of a buffer gas . in a previous paper @xcite , we discussed the effect of phase - changing collisions ( pcc ) with the buffer gas on an @xmath0 system and showed that they lead to considerable narrowing of the eia peak in both the presence and absence of doppler broadening .",
    "these collisions increase the transverse decay rate of the optical transitions , resulting in the so - called pressure broadening of the optical spectral line , and are thus easily incorporated in the bloch equations .",
    "however , in order to describe the overall effect of buffer - gas collisions , it is necessary to include both velocity - changing collisions ( vcc ) as well as pcc @xcite , which is a much greater challenge . due to the complexity of the problem , we limit our discussion to a four - level @xmath0 system , and to buffer - gas pressures that are sufficiently low so that collisional decoherence of the excited state @xcite can be neglected .",
    "the doppler effect occurs in the limit of _ ballistic _ atomic motion , when the mean free - path between vcc is much larger than the radiation wavelength . due to their narrow spectral response ,",
    "raman processes such as eit and eia are much more sensitive to the  residual \" doppler effect , arising when there is a difference between the wavevectors of the raman fields . in many cases",
    "however , the raman wavelength can become much larger than the typical free - path between collisions .",
    "for example , an angular deviation of a milliradian between the two optical beams yields a superposition pattern with a wavelength in the order of a millimeter . in this limit",
    ", the atoms effectively perform a _ diffusion _ motion through the spatial oscillations of the superposition field , leading to the dicke narrowing of the residual doppler width . while the residual doppler broadening is linearly proportional to the raman wavevector , dicke narrowing shows a quadratic dependence .",
