    "the spectacular hickson compact group 31 ( hickson 1982 ) shows a wide range of indicators of galaxy interaction and merging : tidal tails , irregular morphology , complex kinematics , vigourous star bursting ( e.g. rubin et al . 1990 ) and possible formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( e.g. hunberger et al .",
    "all the objects belonging to the group are embedded in a common large hi envelope ( williams et al .",
    "the group is formed by members a+c , b , e , f , g , q ( rubin et al . 1990 ) .",
    "two scenarios have been put forward to explain the nature of the central system a+c : it is either two systems that are about to merge ( e.g. rubin et al . 1990 ) or a single interacting galaxy ( richer et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this letter",
    "we use our new fabry - perot maps and deep imaging from gemini - n to revisit the important problem of the merger nature of the central object of the group , a+c , and , in addition , we investigate the internal kinematics of the tidal dwarf galaxies , in an attempt to identify if they are self gravitating objects or not . we adopt a distance of 54.8 mpc , from the redshift z=0.0137 ( hickson et al . 1992 ) and using h@xmath3=75 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , hence 1 \" @xmath5 0.27 kpc .",
    "observations were carried out with the fabry - perot instrument cigale ( gach et al .",
    "2002 ) attached to the eso 3.6 m telescope in august 2000 .",
    "interferograms were obtained with a high order ( p=1938 ) fabry - perot scanning interferometer , giving a free spectral range of @xmath6 with a _ finesse = 24 _ leading to a spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the pixel size is 0.405 arcsec ; the total exposure time was 72 min ( 6 cycles of 12 min each , 48 scanning steps per cycle ) and the fwhm of the interference filter centered around 6651 @xmath8 was 20 @xmath8 .",
    "the velocity sampling was 3 @xmath9 @xmath10 and the relative velocity accuracy is @xmath11 over the whole field where the s / n is greater than 3 .",
    "reduction of the data cubes were performed using the cigale / adhocw software ( boulesteix , 2002 ) .",
    "the data reduction procedure has been described e.g. in blais - ouellette et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and garrido et al .",
    "for the adopted distance of the group , one pixel corresponds to @xmath5 0.11 kpc .    in august 2003 , we obtained two images with gmos at gemini - n in g and r with exposure times of 1200 and 900 seconds respectively .",
    "these images have a pixel size of 0.14 `` and typical seeing of 0.75 '' .",
    "a color map of the group is presented in fig .",
    "1a . it shows a wealth of star forming regions and the large extent of the optical diffuse light which envelopes the group .",
    "for the first time , regions @xmath2 and @xmath0 , to the east of complex a+c , are seen in great detail and depth .",
    "d show the h@xmath12 monochromatic map of the group , the velocity map and several zoom panels showing the typical velocity profiles in selected regions of the group .",
    "the velocity field was corrected from free spectral range ambiguity using previous kinematic observations . at a first look",
    ", galaxies a and c appear to be a single kinematic entity , as their velocity fields show no discontinuity . under this assumption",
    ", we can infer a rough mass for the a+c complex , within a radius of @xmath5 18 arcsec ( @xmath5 4.9 kpc ) of @xmath13 .",
    "the following parameters and assumptions were used for this mass determination : a maximum rotational velocity of 70@xmath14 ( only from the nw side of the system given that the se side is too disturbed ) , a kinematic inclination and position angle of 51@xmath15 and 130@xmath16 degrees respectively and the assumption that the measured motions are due to disk rotation . nevertheless , multiple profiles ( see fig .",
    "1d ) , evident almost everywhere in the main body of a+c , strongly suggests that a+c is not a single entity and therefore this rough determination provides only an order of magnitude for the mass .",
    "2 shows the velocity gradients of the objects @xmath2 , @xmath0 , e and f , situated around the pair a+c ( see fig 1a ) and which have been thought to be candidate tidal dwarf galaxies ( hunsberger et al . 1996 , iglesias - pramo & vlchez 2001 and richer et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the curves are not corrected for inclination and the central position and velocity were chosen such that the curves were as symmetric as possible , with both sides matching , when possible .",
    "the object with the highest velocity gradient is e , with ordered velocities which range from 3950 @xmath17@xmath4 to 4000 @xmath17@xmath4 .",
    "object @xmath0 also shows ordered motion , with velocities going from 4125 to 4175 @xmath17@xmath4 .",
    "surprisingly , object f , thought to be the best tidal dwarf galaxy candidate in the group , shows a completely flat rotation curve , as does also the smaller object to the northeast of a+c , fragment @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , @xmath2 and f have low gaseous velocity dispersions .",
    "these results will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we obtained the map of the gaseous velocity dispersion at each pixel of the image ( amram et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) assuming the profiles are well represented by a single gaussian .",
    "the value for the velocity dispersion ranges from 10 to 30 @xmath17@xmath4 throughout the group . in particular , objects @xmath2 , @xmath0 , e and f show typical velocity dispersions of 15 @xmath17@xmath4 , which in some isolated regions can reach up to 25 @xmath17@xmath4 .",
    "the highest values for the velocity dispersion lie in the overlapping region between a and c , mainly due to double components .",
    "it is noticeable that these highest values do not match the most intense star forming regions everywhere in the galaxies but particularly where disk a and c overlap , implying that the line broadening and the multiple components are not directly linked to star formation triggered by interaction with another galaxy but specifically by the merging of a+c .",
    "hickson & menon ( 1985 ) reached a similar conclusion , analyzing a radio continuum map of the group .",
    "they found that the 20 cm peak of emission comes from the overlapping regions of a and c , indicating additional evidence of recent excessive starburst activity in this region .",
    "richer et al . ( 2003 ) also presented fabry - perot velocity maps of hcg 31 .",
    "there is fairly good general agreement between their velocity field and ours .",
    "the spectral resolution of our maps is nevertheless six times higher ( 7900 vs 45900 ) and the detection limit several magnitudes fainter .",
    "several authors supported that a and c are separate entities in an ongoing merging phase ( e.g. vorontsov - velyaminov and arhipova , 1963 ; rubin et al . ,",
    "1990 ) while richer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) supported the scenario that a+c is a single interacting spiral galaxy .",
    "the new piece of evidence in support of the merging scenario reported in this paper is the presence of double velocity components throughout the system a+c .",
    "in fact , our higher resolution velocity field shows kinematic structures which are not naturally explained by a single disk but by the merging of two disks .",
    "although sc galaxies are , in general , transparent objects ( bosma 1995 ) , moderate amounts of molecular gas ( as traced by the co ) and cold dust may make some regions opaque . the co emission is weak in hcg 31 but the brightest co peak occurs in the overlapping region between galaxies a and c ( yun et al . 1997 ) where the broader h@xmath12 profiles are observed .",
    "if the co belongs to the foreground galaxy , multiple components are observed in regions optically thick and then could not be observed if disk a and c are two separate galaxies seen in projection , i.e. chance alignment .",
    "multiple gaseous components are observed in the same disk plane when they are not in equilibrium ( e.g. stlin et al .",
    "this occurs when two different entities merge , or when the feedback gas due to star formation interacts with the ism .",
    "we observe in hcg 31 the signature of both mechanisms , the second one being probably a consequence of the first one .",
    "the general pattern of the velocity field of hcg31 a+c is somewhat similar to that of ngc 4038/9 ( the antennae , amram et al . , 1992 )",
    "in which a continuity in the isovelocities between both galaxies is also observed in the overlapping region .",
    "the merging stage of the antennae is slightly less advanced than that for a+c . in the antennae , the two galaxies are clearly separate entities and their bodies , which are not yet overlapping , each display an increasing velocity gradient , which is roughly parallel and run from the ne to the sw ( amram et al .",
    "it is likely that when the disks of ngc 4038 and of ngc 4039 overlap , the velocity field will also present total continuity , as observed in a+c .",
    "galaxy c ( mrk 1089 ) has been classified as a double nucleus markarian galaxy , the two nuclei being separated by 3.4 arcsec ( mazzarella & boroson , 1993 ) and it is difficult to explain the existence of the two nuclei without invoking a merging scenario , as shown by numerical simulations ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) . to reproduce the double line profile in ngc 4848 , vollmer et al ( 2001 )",
    "have used numerical simulations .",
    "they interpret them as the consequence of infalling gas which collides with the ism within the galaxy .",
    "this gives rise to an enhanced star formation observed in the h@xmath12 and in the 20 cm continuum map .",
    "hcg 31 is most probably a group in an early phase of merger , growing through slow and continuous acquisition of galaxies from the associated environment .",
    "moreover , several evidences for interaction with the other galaxy components of the group , namely b , q and g ( e.g. the group is completely embedded in a large hi envelope showing a local maximum on g to the sw and another one around q to the ne ) indicate that the complex a+c is most probably accreting the surrounding galaxies .      several papers in the past ( hunsberger et al .",
    "1996 , johnson and conti 2000 , richer et al .",
    "2003 and iglesias - pramo & vlchez 2001 ) have mentionned the possibility that tidal dwarf galaxies in hcg 31 were formed .",
    "the best candidates are objects e and f , for which metallicities were measured and they were determined to be similar to that of the complex a+c , suggesting a tidal origin for these objects ( richer et al . , 2003 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , we detect ordered motions only for objects @xmath0 and e and not for @xmath2 and f. it might be suspected that the internal velocity motions measured in @xmath0 and e could be due to streaming motions in incipient tidal tails in formation ( see fig .",
    "this is , however , not the case because these objects are counterrotating with respect to the main body of a+c .",
    "the discontinuity of the isovelocities can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "1c : the velocities go from high ( northeast ) to low ( southwest ) in a+c , towards object e. then , along the body of e they go in the opposite sense .",
    "similarly , for object @xmath0 , it presents counterrotation with respect to its immediate neighbor to the west : galaxy a. these objects may fall back onto their progenitor . in fact , from their velocity differences with respect to the a+c complex ( + 115 @xmath17@xmath4 and -60 @xmath17@xmath4 respectively ) and from their relative projected distances ( 6.7 kpc and 5.4 kpc respectively ) and assuming a total mass for the a+c complex of @xmath13 , we could determine that these two objects will indeed , most probably , fall back onto a+c .",
    "the same is true for object f , which although more distant from a+c , has a very small radial velocity difference of @xmath5 60 @xmath17@xmath4 .",
    "we note , however , that given the fact that we measure radial velocities ( and not the velocity component in the plane of the sky ) , the observed internal velocities of the tidal fragments are lower limits .",
    "region f , which was previously thought to be the best example of a tidal dwarf galaxy in hcg 31 , is indeed part of the main merger , following the same kinematic pattern of the parent galaxy and presenting no rotation nor significant internal velocity dispersion .",
    "region f was found to have low or inexistent old stellar population by johnson and conti ( 2000 ) . if there is no old stellar population the velocity dispersion of the gas is mainly indicating the dynamics of the cloud .",
    "the range of values derived for the internal velocity dispersion of f , 15 - 25 @xmath17@xmath4 , is too close to the natural turbulence of the gas and/or the expanding velocity due to starburst winds .",
    "the lack of rotation and the continuity of the kinematics between the main body of the merger and object f suggest it is simply a tidal debris , although , considering its projected distance from a+c ( 16 kpc ) and the large amount of fuel available in the whole area of the merger ( 2.1 @xmath18 of hi gas ) , it could perhaps develop into a tidal dwarf galaxy in the future , by accretion of infalling material .",
    "there is also the possibility that regions @xmath2 and f present no velocity gradient due to their rotation pattern be along the line of sight .",
    "although this could be a possibility for the smaller and rounder region @xmath2 , it is less likely the case for region f , given its elongated morphology .",
    "our two main results are :    \\1 ) we measure multiple kinematic components throughout the body of a+c which we interpret as a strong indication that this complex is an ongoing merger . the double photometric nucleus has been identified in several previous images of hcg 31 including the spectacular hst image published by johnson and conti ( 2000 ) and in fig .",
    "the double kinematic component is shown here for the first time in fig .",
    "\\2 ) f and @xmath2 present flat rotation velocity profiles and insignificant velocity dispersions . in contrast ,",
    "@xmath0 and e are structures counterrotating with respect to the parent a+c complex .",
    "we conclude that hcg 31 is a merging group which is probably going to soon end up as a field elliptical galaxy",
    ". it would be very valuable to compare our new , high spectral resolution maps to simulations of groups to investigate which interaction and merger parameters fit these data .",
