    "galactic rings are a peculiar phenomenon among galaxies .",
    "a prototype ring galaxy is the famous cartwheel galaxy , with a spectacular ring luminous in the infrared ( ir ) , optical , uv , and x - ray bands .",
    "the formation of ring - like structures in galaxies is not fully understood .",
    "the two most common theories are the collisional origin and the resonance origin .",
    "a collisional ring could be created by a head - on collision between a compact companion galaxy and a larger disk system ; a collisional ring galaxy usually contains an off - centered nucleus and an asymmetric ring structure , and there is a significant chance of finding a companion galaxy close to the ring galaxy ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a resonance ring could be produced by the outer lindblad resonance of spiral bars ; such a system is preferentially observed in barred galaxies , and the resulting ring is generally symmetric ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are a few systems that are difficult to explain with these two theories , such as the hoag s object @xcite , for which alternative formation scenarios have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "galactic rings are expected to exhibit significant star formation compared to their progenitor galaxies mainly due to the enhanced gas densities in the rings , regardless of the formation mechanism .",
    "surveys of ring galaxies in optical , h@xmath8 , ir , and radio have revealed that the rings are generally rich in hi gas and hii regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . with _ chandra _ s subarcsecond angular resolution",
    ", it is now possible to study in detail the x - ray binary ( xrb ) populations in nearby galaxies , e.g. , low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that are associated with old stellar populations and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) that are associated with young stellar populations ( see e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "therefore , x - ray observations have become an independent approach for constraining the nature of the underlying stellar populations by means of x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) and x - ray colors of the xrbs .",
    "however , little is known regarding the x - ray properties of galactic rings , except for the cartwheel galaxy , which has an exceptionally large number of young ( @xmath9  yr ) ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; @xmath10  erg  s@xmath7 ; e.g. , @xcite ) in the star - forming ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 1291 is a remarkable ring galaxy , first noted by @xcite .",
    "it was classified as ( r)sb(s)0/a ( rc3 ; @xcite ) , and is virtually face - on @xcite .",
    "the images of ngc 1291 in the uv , optical , and near - ir ( nir ) are shown in figure [ img ] .",
    "the galaxy includes a fainter outer ring and a prominent bulge , which was considered as a prototypical pseudobulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at a distance of 8.9 mpc , ngc 1291 has @xmath11=@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the d@xmath13 ellipse of ngc 1291 has a size of @xmath14 @xcite , and the nuclear position of the galaxy is @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the galactic column density along the line of sight to ngc 1291 is @xcite .",

    "intense star formation still appears present in the ring of ngc 1291 , which is obvious from the uv image ( figure [ img ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the bulge is much redder than the ring , and dominates in the nir image ( figure [ img ] ) . mapped the hi distribution in ngc 1291 , and revealed that hi gas is concentrated in the ring region .",
    "the ring also contains discrete hii regions , while the bulge has filaments of ionized gas @xcite .",
    "given the uv / optical / radio data , the ring appears to host a younger stellar population than the bulge .",
    "@xcite studied the star - formation history of many galaxies including ngc 1291 , using spectral energy distribution fitting techniques .",
    "the best - fit model for ngc 1291 ( noll , private communication ) includes two exponential starburst events : one happened 10  gyr ago with an e - folding timescale of 0.25  gyr and the other happened 200  myr ago with an e - folding timescale of 50  myr .",
    "the stellar mass of the old population is @xmath18 times higher than that of the younger one .",
    "although the fitting results were derived for the entire galaxy and may have large uncertainties , they are consistent with the uv / optical / radio data if the ring hosts the younger stellar population .",

    "chandra _",
    "twice in june and november 2000 , with a total exposure of @xmath19  ks .",
    "a first study by @xcite was limited to the bulge region .",
    "@xcite presented a point - source catalog based on these observations , and found that the xlf and x - ray colors suggest old xrb populations in the galaxy .",
    "this study however , did not discriminate between bulge and ring xrbs .",
    "we obtained two additional _ chandra _  observations of ngc 1291 in may 2010 , with a total exposure of @xmath20  ks .",
    "the new observations cover the majority of the ring region , allowing us to investigate the xrb populations in the bulge and ring respectively .",
    "ngc 1291 is much closer than the cartwheel galaxy ( @xmath21  mpc compared to @xmath22  mpc ) , and thus we are able to probe the ring xrb population down to an unprecedented luminosity limit ( @xmath23  erg  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "we compare the ring xrb population to the bulge population and test whether the galactic ring hosts a younger stellar population from an x - ray point of view .",
    "the deep observations on the bulge also allow us to compare its lmxb population to those of the recently acquired deep exposures of elliptical galaxies , and establish if all lmxb populations are indeed compatible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the nuclear source and ulx candidates are also discussed . in section 5 ,",
    "we calculate and parameterize the xlfs for the bulge and ring regions , respectively , taking into account the detection incompleteness and background agn contamination .",
    "we model the observed xlf using population synthesis ( ps ) models in section 6 . in section 7 , we discuss implications of the x - ray properties and we argue that the ring hosts a younger stellar population than the bulge .",
    "we summarize our results in section 8 .",
    "ngc 1291 has been observed with the s3 chip of _ chandra _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) at four epochs .",
    "the four observations are listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] along with their exposure times , ranging from 37  ks to 70  ks .",
    "the focal - plane temperature was @xmath24c for all the observations .",
    "we reduced and analyzed the observational data using mainly the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) tools .",
    "we used the chandra_repro script to reprocess the data with the latest calibration .",
    "the background light curve of each observation was then inspected and background flares were removed using the deflare ciao script .",
    "the flare - cleaned exposure times are also listed in table  [ tbl - obs ] ; there was a significant flare in observation 2059 that reduces its usable exposure by @xmath0 .",
    "the total usable exposure for ngc  1291 is 178.6 ks .",
    "we registered the astrometry of the observations using the ciao tool reproject_aspect .",
    "we created a 0.38.0 kev image for each observation and searched for sources using wavdetect @xcite at a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath25 .",
    "these source lists were used to register the observations to the astrometric frame of observation 11272 with the ciao script reproject_aspect , adopting a 3@xmath26 matching radius and a residual rejection limit of 0.6@xmath26 .",
    "we reprojected the registered event lists to observation 11272 using reproject_events , and then merged all the observations to create a master event file using dmmerge .",
    "the acis - s3 chip has different pointings for the four observations , and the average aim point ( weighted by exposure time ) is @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we constructed images from the merged event file using the standard  grade set (  grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) for six bands : ( full band ) , ( soft band ) , ( conventional soft band ) , ( hard band ) , ( soft band 1 ) , and ( soft band 2 ) . for each observation , we created exposure maps in these bands following the basic procedure outlined in section 3.2 of @xcite , which takes into account the effects of vignetting , gaps between the ccds , bad - column filtering , bad - pixel filtering , and the spatially dependent degradation in quantum efficiency due to contamination on the acis optical - blocking filters .",
    "a photon index of @xmath29 was assumed in creating the exposure map , which is a typical value for photon indices of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "merged exposure maps were then created from the exposure maps of the individual observations .",
    "we created adaptively smoothed images from the raw images using the ciao tool csmooth .",
    "exposure - corrected smoothed images were then constructed following section 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ clrimg ] a color composite of the exposure - corrected smoothed images in the 0.31.0 , 1.02.0 , and 2.08.0 kev bands .",
    "we ran wavdetect on the full - band image to search for x - ray point sources , with a `` @xmath30  sequence '' of wavelet scales ( i.e. ,  1 , @xmath30 , 2 , @xmath31 , 4 , @xmath32 , 8 , @xmath33 , and 16 pixels ) and a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath25 . at this threshold , we expect approximately two false detections given the size of the image ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are 169 x - ray sources detected in the full band .",
    "we utilized the acis extract ( ae ; @xcite ) program to derive the source photometry .",
    "the main advantage of ae compared to a simple circular - aperture extraction approach is that ae uses a polygonal extraction region to represent the point spread function ( psf ) for each observation of each source individually , which is more suitable for multiple observations with different aim points and roll angles .",
    "briefly , ae constructs source extraction regions that approximate @xmath34 encircled - energy fraction ( eef ) contours of the psfs at 1.50 kev for each exposure .",
    "smaller extraction regions ( as low as @xmath35 ) were used for sources in crowded regions .",
    "background counts were extracted in an annular region around each source excluding any pixels that belong to detected sources ; the number of extracted background counts was required to be at least 100 to reduce the uncertainty from the background estimation .",
    "encircled - energy fractions at several energies ( ranging from 0.28 to 8.60 kev ) were provided by ae , and thus we derived aperture corrections for all the six x - ray bands listed in section [ datared ] via interpolation .",
    "aperture - corrected net ( background - subtracted ) source counts and the corresponding 1@xmath36 errors @xcite for these bands were then computed ; the errors were propagated through the errors of the extracted sources and background counts following the numerical method described in  1.7.3 of @xcite . as the source detection",
    "was performed only in the full band , we consider a source as undetected in a given band ( other than the full band ) if it is less significant than 3@xmath36 , when calculated using the net counts and 1@xmath36 error in that band . an upper limit on the source counts was derived for an undetected source , using the bayesian approach of @xcite for the 99% confidence level if the extracted number of counts is less than 10 in the given band ; otherwise , we calculated a 3@xmath36 upper limit following the poisson statistic @xcite .",
    "an x - ray spectrum for each source was extracted by ae along with the spectrum of its local background .",
    "we performed spectral fitting of each source using xspec ( version 12.6.0 ; @xcite ) with the cash fitting statistic ( cstat ; @xcite ) .",
    "an absorbed power - law model ( tbabs*pow ) was employed for sources with more than 30 full - band counts ; for the other sources , the spectra were modeled with a simple power law with the photon index fixed at @xmath29 .",
    "the observed full - band fluxes were derived from the best - fit spectra , which were then converted to full - band luminosities .",
    "we applied a smaller correction factor ( 1.05 ) to the observed full - band luminosities to account for the galactic absorption .    of the 169 point sources , 75 are in the bulge region and 71 in the ring area .",
    "we defined the bulge and ring regions based on the uv and nir images shown in figure 1 .",
    "we examined the surface brightness contours of the @xmath37-band image and selected a contour that encloses @xmath38 of the light within the d@xmath13 ellipse .",
    "this contour can be well approximated by an @xmath39 ellipse centered on the galactic nucleus , which was used to defined the bulge boundary .",
    "the ring region is defined by two ellipses centered on the galactic nucleus .",
    "we fixed the position angle ( 70 ) and axis ratio ( 1.15 ) of the ellipses according to the morphology information given in @xcite and only allowed the sizes of the ellipses to vary so that the ring region includes the majority of the prominent uv ring features .",
    "we note that @xmath40 of ring region is covered by the _ chandra _  exposure ( see figure  [ clrimg ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the x - ray sources is displayed in figure  [ posplot]a , and their luminosity distribution is show in figure  [ posplot]b .",
    "the full - band luminosities range from @xmath41 to @xmath42  erg  s@xmath7 .",

    "1 .   column  1 : the source number , listed in order of increasing right ascension .",
    "2 .   columns  2 and 3 : the right ascension and declination of the source , respectively .",

    "this is the distance between the source position given in columns  2 and 3 and the average aim point ( see section  [ datared ] ) .",
    "4 .   column  5 : the radial distance of the source to the nucleus of the galaxy in arcminutes .",

    "it is set to `` @xmath44 '' if the flux variability is not available .",
    "column  34 : region flag for the source .",
    "the flag is `` bulge '' if the source is located in the bulge , `` ring '' if the source is in the ring , or `` other '' if the source is neither in the bulge nor in the ring .",
    "we constructed a radial profile of the x - ray source surface density .",
    "given the non - circular shapes of the ring and bulge , we calculated x - ray source densities in four elliptical annular regions in the bulge , four elliptical annular regions in the ring , and one region in between the bulge and the ring .",
    "the elliptical annular regions in the ring / bulge have the same position angle and axis ratio as the ring / bulge and are evenly spaced in their distances to the galactic nucleus .",
    "we corrected the number of x - ray sources in each region for the detection incompleteness and background agn contamination ( see section [ completeness ] below ; the incompleteness correction was derived in the corresponding region ) .",
    "for this purpose , we only included sources that are outside the central 10-radius region and have full - band luminosity @xmath45  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "the corrected number of sources was then divided by the region area to obtain the surface density .",
    "the x - ray source radial profile is presented in figure  [ radprofile ] .",
    "there appears to be an overdensity of x - ray sources in the ring of the galaxy compared to the region in between the bulge and the ring .",
    "we also included in this plot surface brightness radial profiles for the _ galex _ nuv and 2mass @xmath37-band data , calculated in the same regions as above .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are arbitrarily normalized so that the highest brightness has the same value as the highest source density .",
    "the nuv surface brightness is expected to trace the young stellar populations , while the @xmath37-band emission is sensitive to the old stellar populations . in the ring region ,",
    "the nuv and @xmath37-band surface brightness profiles differ significantly .",
    "the x - ray source radial profile in the ring does not continue with the trend shown in the bulge and the region in between , and it mainly follows the nuv surface brightness distribution , suggesting that the x - ray sources in the bulge and ring regions are associated with different stellar populations and the ring stellar population is likely younger .",
    "the nuclear point source ( xid 84 ) of ngc 1291 has a position of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and an observed full - band luminosity of @xmath42  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "it has been classified as a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xcite suggested that it is an obscured low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) based on the x - ray spectral analysis of the first two _ chandra _  observations .",
    "we show the x - ray spectra of the source for the four individual observations in figure  [ lda ] , which were extracted by ae with polygonal regions that approximate the @xmath48 eef psfs in the 0.38.0 kev band .",
    "local background spectra were also extracted by ae in the same annular regions as those used in the photometry extraction .",
    "there are clearly strong soft x - ray excesses in the spectra of all the observations , which are typical among low - luminosity agns and are considered to originate from hot gas in the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we thus fit the spectra using xspec with an absorbed power - law ( agn ) plus thermal plasma ( hot gas ) model ( wabs1*apec+wabs2*pow ) .",
    "note that there could be multiple temperatures present in the gas , however , the limited signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the data can not place strong constraints on a multi - temperature plasma .",
    "the spectral slope and column density for the power - law component were free to vary during the fitting .",
    "for the thermal component , we set the abundance to be solar , and then we determined its temperature ( @xmath49  kev ) and absorption column density ( @xmath50  @xmath51 ) by fitting the stacked spectrum of the four observations . in the spectral fitting of the individual observations , the temperature and column density parameters were fixed , and only the normalization was allowed to vary .",

    "it has been noted that long - term variability in luminosity and spectral parameters is common among obscured agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "hence , a bh - xrb population consistent with observations could either result from a steeper imf ( slope of -2.7 ) and ce prescription where we allow for all possible outcomes , even with a hertzsprung gap donor , or it could result from a flatter imf ( slope of -2.35 ) and a ce model where a ce event with a hertzsprung gap donor would always lead to a merger .",

    "furthermore , we strictly limit the accretion rate to the eddington limit . these limiting mass - transfer rates in our modeling are responsible for the apparent jumps in the synthetic xlf . however , in nature there is no sharp transition between thermally stable and unstable disks , nor a precise limit in the highest accretion rate possible .",
    "accretion onto a compact object is a non - linear and much more complex process , which in reality can results in a smoother luminosity distribution with no sharp transitions . finally , by assuming a solar metallicity for the stellar population of ngc 1291 in order to be consistent with @xcite and in the absence of any stellar metallicity measurements , we impose in practice a maximum bh mass of @xmath128 .",
    "if instead part of the stellar population had a lower metallicity ( e.g. 30% solar ) then the maximum bh mass would increase to @xmath129 or more @xcite , which could smooth out the jump at the very luminous end of the xlf .",
    "we found that the bh - xrbs that populate the high - end of the xlf ( above @xmath130  erg  s@xmath7 , eddington limit for a hydrogen accreting neutron star ) are transient systems with evolved companion stars , while at lower luminosities the xrb population consists of a mixture of transient and persistent xrbs with a neutron star accretor and a giant or a main sequence ( ms ) donor star . these findings and the general shape of the synthetic xlf",

    "<S> we present _ chandra _  studies of the x - ray binary ( xrb ) populations in the bulge and ring regions of the ring galaxy ngc 1291 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 169 x - ray point sources in the galaxy , 75 in the bulge and 71 in the ring , utilizing the four available _ chandra _  observations totaling an effective exposure of 179 ks . </S>",
    "<S> we report photometric properties of these sources in a point - source catalog . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath0 of the bulge sources and @xmath1 of the ring sources showing @xmath2 long - term variability in their x - ray count rate . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray colors suggest that a significant fraction of the bulge ( @xmath3 ) and ring ( @xmath4 ) sources are likely low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the nuclear source indicate that it is a low - luminosity agn with moderate obscuration ; spectral variability is observed between individual observations . </S>",
    "<S> we construct 0.38.0 kev x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) for the bulge and ring xrb populations , taking into account the detection incompleteness and background agn contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we reach 90% completeness limits of @xmath5 and @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7  for the bulge and ring populations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both xlfs can be fit with a broken power - law model , and the shapes are consistent with those expected for populations dominated by lmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> we perform detailed population synthesis modeling of the xrb populations in ngc 1291 , which suggests that the observed combined xlf is dominated by an old lmxb population . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the bulge and ring xrb populations , and argue that the ring xrbs are associated with a younger stellar population than the bulge sources , based on the relative overdensity of x - ray sources in the ring , the generally harder x - ray color of the ring sources , the overabundance of luminous sources in the combined xlf , and the flatter shape of the ring xlf . </S>"
