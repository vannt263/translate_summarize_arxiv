    "generation of spin currents is of essential importance in spintronics . so far ,",
    "several methods have been known to generate spin currents , namely , spin injection from ferromagnetic metals , the spin hall effect@xcite , the spin pumping effect @xcite , and the spin injection by the spin accumulation ( spin chemical potential ) @xcite . it was recently demonstrated that thermal generation of spin currents is also possible ( the spin seebeck effect ) @xcite .    in solids , the spin density ( @xmath0 ) and spin current ( @xmath1 ) satisfy the continuity equation with a source or sink term , @xmath2 ; @xmath3 the right - hand side is the spin relaxation torque . in metals , it arises mainly from the spin - orbit interaction . in the case of uniform and dynamic magnetization",
    ", the relaxation torque reduces to the gilbert damping torque @xcite . in the context of the spin - transfer torque in inhomogeneous spin structures",
    ", the spin relaxation torque leads to a non - adiabatic torque ( @xmath4 term ) @xcite . in the case of electric spin injection from ferromagnetic metal to non - magnetic metal ,",
    "the spin relaxation torque was shown to be proportional to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the applied electric field ) and the spin injection effect is explained based on the behavior of spin relaxation torque at the interface @xcite .",
    "the spin relaxation torque thus plays an essential role in spin current generation and dissipation .    to detect the spin current electrically , the inverse spin hall effect is widely used by attaching metals with strong spin - orbit interaction , such as pt @xcite . in the non - local spin",
    "injection experiment , kimura _ et al . _ discussed on a phenomenological ground that the spin current in cu is absorbed by pt due to the strong spin relaxation in pt ( spin sink effect ) , and that the absorbed spin current is converted into electric voltage by the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "what is essential in the spin sink effect is a spatial inhomogeneity of the spin - orbit interaction , namely , the gradient of the spin - orbit interaction of the spin relaxation torque . in this paper , we investigate this possibility by microscopic calculation .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian with rashba spin - orbit interaction coupled with an electromagnetic field .",
    "rsof exists when the inversion symmetry is broken at the interface or surface @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath7 is composed of non - perturbative part @xmath8 and perturbative part @xmath9 .",
    "each term is @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the annihilation operator of a conduction electron , @xmath12 represents pauli matrices , @xmath13 is the magnetization , @xmath14 is rsof and @xmath15 is a vector potential for the electromagnetic field .",
    "@xmath16 is the random impurity potential and averaging over the impurity position is carried out as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the strength of the impurity and the impurity concentration respectively .",
    "the rsof is assumed to arise from the gradient of a scalar potential and thus to satisfy @xmath20 . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the spin torque in both systems , that is , non - magnets and ferromagnets , where we adapt @xmath21 for non - magnets and @xmath22 for ferromagnets .",
    "the spin density in the continuity equation is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath4 and @xmath24 represent the spin indices , and a spin current polarized in the @xmath25 direction flowing in the @xmath26 direction is defined by @xmath27 the spin relaxation torque is derived by taking quantum and statistical averages of the heisenberg s equation of motion for the spin operator @xcite .",
    "its @xmath25 component reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the levi - civita symbol .      by calculating the spin relaxation torque perturbatively within the keldysh green s function formulation ,",
    "we access the issue of spin source and sink .",
    "the contribution of spin relaxation torque which is i - th order in the rsof and j - th order in the vector potential is denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "first , we deal with the case without the vector potential , i.e. , @xmath31 . the first order contribution with respect to the rsof , @xmath32 , vanishes .",

    "we first consider non - magnets , where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the identity matrix of spin space ) . by using the rotational symmetry ,",
    "the angular average of the wave vectors is calculated as @xmath39 .",
    "we see that the leading contribution contains the second order derivative of the rsof .",
    "the torque is calculated as @xmath40 \\left ( \\bm{e}_{\\mathrm{so}}\\times \\bm{p}_1 ^ 2\\bm{e}_{\\mathrm{so}}(\\bm{p}_1 ) \\right)^\\alpha,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 represents the advanced green s function and @xmath42 is the retarded one .",

    "in the case of spin - polarized conduction electrons , i.e. , in ferromagnets , the spin relaxation torque is affected by spin polarization . nevertheless , the contributions of the zeroth and first order derivative of the rsof vanish in the same way as in unpolarized case , resulting in @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the density of states for spin - split bands and @xmath49 . under equilibrium condition , whether the spin of conduction electrons is polarized or not is not so important for the qualitative behavior of the spin relaxation torque .",

    "we note that contributions containing derivatives such as in eq .",
    "( 12 ) arise also in ferromagnets as so small corrections to @xmath58 .",

    "( [ lo ] ) for a junction of two nonmagnetic metals shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) , the rsof at the interface needs to form a vector chirality ( @xmath68 ) to induce finite spin relaxation torque .",
    "such configuration is expected to arise generally when the junction is of finite area .",
    "since the rashba effect is due to the structure - inversion - symmetry breaking of a quantum well and the rsof arises from the gradient of a scalar potential , the rsof will behave near the edges as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) . let us consider a square junction area in the @xmath69 plane with an applied electric field ( or current ) along the @xmath70 direction . then both the first and the second terms of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) have only the component with @xmath71 .",
    "the sign of the relaxation torque is negative along the @xmath72 direction and positive along @xmath70 direction , resulting in the torque density distribution of figs .",
    "3 ( e ) and 3 ( f ) with the spin sink along the @xmath72 axis and spin source along the @xmath70 axis . in the static case ,",
    "the spin current generated by the present torque density is polarized in the @xmath72 direction and satisfies @xmath73 . in the analogy with the gauss s law of the classical electromagnetism ,",
    "the generated - spin - current distribution is as depicted in figs .",
    "3 ( c ) , 3 ( d ) and 3 ( g ) . since the induced torque comes from the vector chirality of the rsof , the spin - current distribution generated by the spin relaxation torque is the same for the opposite sides of the system , which is different from that induced by the spin hall effect .",
    "experimental observation of the local spin current would be interesting .",
    "as we have discussed , the spin continuity equation is useful to understand the spin current generation and absorption based on the spin relaxation torque distribution .",
    "one should note , however , that the result of the spin current determined this way has an ambiguity given by a rotation of some vector , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is any vector field ) .",
    "it would be important to investigate other equations for the spin current defining its rotation .",

    "in summary , we presented a microscopic theory of spin relaxation torque in nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic metals with nonuniform spin - orbit coupling within the keldysh green s function formalism .",
    "we found that the spin relaxation torque depends quantitatively on whether an external electric field is applied or not and on the spin polarization of the carrier . in the case of non - magnets , there exist equilibrium spin currents induced by vector chirality of rsof in the absence of an external field . in the presence of an external field ,",
    "on the other hand , spin relaxation torque arises from the coupling of the electric field and vector chirality of rsof . in ferromagnets , in contrast , uniform rsof results in the spin relaxation torque .",
