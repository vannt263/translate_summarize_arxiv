    "for the same reason a weaker version of lemma [ comprcap ] is stated in @xcite .    at this point one should observe that the essence of the capacity method introduced in @xcite does not allow to produce the required @xmath39-estimate in the case of a big and non nef class .",

    "this blow - up phenomenon has been one of the motivations of our work , which has led us to the proof of tian s conjecture @xcite .",
    "moreover fixed point methods do not produce a priori the @xmath39-estimate needed to construct singular khler - einstein metrics and to investigate their regularity .",
    "we wish to point out that in a quite recent preprint @xcite the authors claim ( in theorem 1.1 ) boundedness and continuity of the solutions of some particular type of degenerate complex monge - ampre equations .",
    "no proof of this claim seems to be provided .",
    "the authors also claim a stability result which is not sufficient to imply the continuity of solutions in the degenerate case .",
    "in fact a sequence of discontinuous functions converging in @xmath39-norm does not have necessarily a continuous limit@xmath594 ! moreover the same claim ( theorem 1.1 ) has been stated in @xcite , @xcite , but again no proof of continuity seems to be given ( see page 12 in @xcite and page 146 in @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments for the boundedness of the solutions in @xcite , @xcite are quite informal in the degenerate case and seem impossible to follow .",
    "concerning the stability of the solutions , the continuity assumption is quite natural and often available in the applications .",
    "in fact in the applications one works with smooth solutions provided by the aubin - yau solution of the calabi conjecture with respect to variable khler forms of type @xmath889 , as in the proof of theorem [ hgregma ] .",
    "this perturbation process is one of the reasons of trouble for the continuity of the solutions . moreover",
    "the stability with respect to the data @xmath406 considered in @xcite is not essential in this context since one has @xmath25-compactness of quasi - plurisubharmonic functions normalized by the supremum condition .",
    "in fact a particular case of the stability result , namely theorem [ kolo ] b , implies the continuity of the solution of the complex monge - ampre equation @xmath1163 , whenever @xmath143 is a khler metric and @xmath1164 .",
    "this fact has been observed also in @xcite .",
