    "<S> business - cycle phenomenon has long been regarded as an empirical curiosity in macroeconomics . regarding its causes </S>",
    "<S> , recent evidence suggests that economic oscillations are engendered by fluctuations in the level of entrepreneurial activity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> opportunities promoting such activity are known to be embedded in social network structures@xcite . however , predominant understanding of the dynamics of economic oscillations originates from stylised pendulum models on aggregate macroeconomic variables@xcite , which overlook the role of social networks to economic activity  echoing the so - called _ aggregation problem _ of reconciling macroeconomics with microeconomics@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate how oscillations can arise in a networked economy epitomised by an industry known as multi - level marketing or mlm@xcite , the lifeblood of which is the profit - driven interactions among entrepreneurs . quarterly data ( over a decade ) which i gathered from public mlms reveal oscillatory time - series of entrepreneurial activity that display nontrivial scaling and _ _ persistence__@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i found through a stochastic population - dynamic model , which agrees with the notion of profit maximisation as the organising principle of capitalist enterprise , that oscillations exhibiting those characteristics arise at the brink of a critical balance between entrepreneurial activation and inactivation brought about by a homophily - driven _ </S>",
    "<S> network effect_. oscillations develop because of stochastic tunnelling permitted through the destabilisation by noise of an evolutionarily stable state . </S>",
    "<S> the results fit altogether as evidence to the burns - mitchell conjecture that economic oscillations must be induced by the workings of an underlying  network of free enterprises searching for profit\"@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i anticipate that the findings , interpreted under a mesoeconomic framework@xcite , could open a viable window for scrutinising the nature of business oscillations through the lens of the emerging field of network science . </S>",
    "<S> enquiry along these lines could shed further light into the network origins of the business - cycle phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> known widely in literature as _ network marketing _ , mlm executes through embedded social networks its essential business functions such as goods distribution , consumption , marketing , and direct selling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that makes mlm a stark microcosm of a networked economy . </S>",
    "<S> one salient yet so far overlooked feature of mlm dynamics is the aperiodic oscillations in firm size @xmath0 , quantified by the number of participating entrepreneurs ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> empirical quarterly firm - size data have been collected from four public mlms ( supplementary data ; supplementary methods , s1 ) : nuskin enterprises ( nus ) , nature sunshine ( natr ) , usana health sciences ( usna ) , and mannatech inc . </S>",
    "<S> ( mtex ) . </S>",
    "<S> publicly - listed firms are chosen because they are required to disclose accurate business data on a regular basis . </S>",
    "<S> the average revenue ( i.e. , total revenue divided by @xmath1 for any given quarter ) does not proportionately rise with @xmath1 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , d ) , implying that firm - size expansion does not inevitably translate into revenue growth . </S>",
    "<S> firm size is thus a more reliable quantifier for entrepreneurial activity than is total revenue .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling property of the @xmath0 time - series is examined via hurst analysis@xcite ( methods ; supplementary methods , s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hurst exponents , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , quantify the scaling of the absolute increments and of the power spectrum , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> overall , these features of the time - series suggest that mlm firm dynamics is a non - wiener unifractal process@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> generally , @xmath10 within standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation values are determined from a pre - testing procedure ( supplementary methods , s1 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : hursts ]    [ fig : empirical ]    an mlm firm is considered as a population of profit - seeking entrepreneurs </S>",
    "<S> . this population exhibits disorder through the presence of two entrepreneur types distinguished by socio - economic status ( ses ) . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote these types , wherein @xmath11 has higher ses than @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote their subpopulation size , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the total population at any given time @xmath15 is thus @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> three major processes run the population dynamics : entrepreneurial activation by recruitment ; competitive inactivation ; and catalytic inactivation due to a network effect . </S>",
    "<S> recruitment is expressed in the following reaction equations : @xmath17 wherein @xmath18 and @xmath19 are per - capita rates of recruitment of types @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath20 because @xmath11 s higher ses implies a faster rate of entrepreneurial activation through the support of bigger capital and vaster social resources . </S>",
    "<S> competitive inactivation occurs due to market overlap , or _ </S>",
    "<S> _ niche overlap__@xcite , as participants can go head - to - head over the same clientele or market . </S>",
    "<S> an encounter rate @xmath21 , which can be related to the density of the embedding social network , quantifies the probability of market overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> thus , competitive inactivation is : @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> lastly , catalytic inactivation , which denotes the _ network effect _ ( methods ) , is expressed as : @xmath23 the network structure of the mlm catalyses inactivation of existing participants at the rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a measure of the probability that two members drawn randomly from the mlm belong to the same type . </S>",
    "<S> it has been widely used in literature as a diversity index@xcite . due to interconnectedness and homophily@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the inactivation of one could ( like a contagion ) infect another to follow suit .    </S>",
    "<S> combining equations  ( [ eq : recruitment]  [ eq : catalytic ] ) results to a master equation ( supplementary equation 1 ) for the state probability density . </S>",
    "<S> perturbation analysis accounts for the fluctuations arising from demographic stochasticity@xcite . in terms of the system size @xmath26 ( roughly the size of that part of the overall population considered _ fit _ for entrepreneurial activities ) the following ansatz </S>",
    "<S> is made : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the average concentrations , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the magnitude of the fluctuations of the stochastic variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ( supplementary methods , s2 ) . the highest order in the expansion expresses the macroscopic rate equations for @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath33 meanwhile , the next highest order term gives the fokker - planck equation , or fpe ( supplementary equation 2 ) , governing the dynamics of the probability density for the magnitude of the fluctuations . from the fpe , the expectation values of the stationary fluctuations are @xmath34 , which supports the interpretation that the deterministic solutions to  ( [ eq : macroscopic ] ) are the correct average values .    </S>",
    "<S> the model is nondimensionalised by setting the characteristic timescale at @xmath35  days ( methods ) . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , the rates can be squarely related to empirical data by rescaling to appropriate units . </S>",
    "<S> dimensionless rates take on simplified yet meaningful values : @xmath36 ; @xmath37 ; and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> bifurcation analysis ( supplementary methods , s4 ) of the nondimensionalised equation  ( [ eq : macroscopic ] ) unveils a bifurcation manifold @xmath39 , where @xmath40 equation  ( [ eq : bifurcation ] ) coincides with an evolutionarily stable state ( ess ) of a population game between the types ( supplementary methods , s3  s4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of @xmath11  entrepreneurs is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the fluctuation component . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the second moments from the fpe shows that the variance diverges as @xmath44 as @xmath45 ( supplementary methods , s5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is a signature of criticality through which the ess , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is ( quite counterintuitively ) destabilised as the bifurcation manifold is approached . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is hereby referred as _ </S>",
    "<S> stochastic tunnelling _ wherein noise enables the state trajectory to cross a phase barrier that could not have been otherwise traversed without actively tuning the bifurcation parameter ( supplementary methods , s4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> stochastic tunnelling drives the business oscillations ( fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> time series is generated by solving the model using a numerical technique , known as gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm@xcite , which directly integrates the master equation ( supplementary methods , s6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> diverging variance indeed allows the solution to wander far enough from the ess and closer to an unstable point ( uep ) which pushes that solution toward the boundary state , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> that noise also enables the solution to sling back to the ess consequently forming loops in the phase portrait , hence , oscillations in the time series ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the time series consist of upswings associated with increasing diversity and downswings with decreasing diversity , i.e. , @xmath50 as @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable observation is that recovery from low points of the series coincide with periods when @xmath11 is dominant  a case of the fitter entrepreneurs surviving through  recessions\"@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> profit maximisation is an axiom of capitalist enterprise@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mlm may enhance profitability by maximising the proportion of @xmath11    entrepreneurs ( supplementary methods , s7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the time - average value @xmath52 is examined for various pairs of @xmath18 and @xmath53 which consequently depicts the phase diagram of the model ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> business oscillations come about as a result of stochastic tunnelling through the critical boundary @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> phase ii , where @xmath11 stably dominates ( supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2b ) , can be considered pareto - optimal as the mlm maximises profitability as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> but high levels of targeted recruitment , i.e. , @xmath55 , are required . </S>",
    "<S> entrepreneurial activation , however , might in reality be less discriminatory and thus @xmath56 , which denotes higher entropy ( supplementary discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the critical boundary delineates , for any magnitude @xmath53 of the network effect , the minimum @xmath18 that promotes long - run dominance of @xmath11    entrepreneurs . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a stronger network effect tends to frustrate that dominance as catalytic inactivation increasingly outpaces activation , leading to degradation of entrepreneurial activity ( supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ess at the iii - iv boundary ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) is therefore pareto - dominated  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hurst maps ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , c ) locate where the real mlms are on the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the hurst exponents are determined from the same exact method . </S>",
    "<S> clusters appear in the vicinity of the iii - iv boundary . on these clusters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are approximately between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , about the same range of values found in real mlms ( see table  1 ) . a correlative plot ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d ) between @xmath2 and @xmath3 further confirms not only agreement between model and empirical data , but also their unifractality . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these findings suggest that real - world mlms are pareto - dominated economic systems@xcite , which are operating in an environment characterised by high entropy , i.e. , @xmath56 , and by a strong network effect ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the study paints an illuminating insight about the nature of mlm operations . </S>",
    "<S> mlms have been accused in several instances by discontent participants for ethical violations concerning its business practices@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model justifies such disgruntlement for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , that profit is closely associated with recruitment implies less selective entrepreneurial activation . </S>",
    "<S> second , that recruitment proceeds through embedded networks connotes strong network effects . </S>",
    "<S> less - fit entrepreneurs can join the market in droves but are weeded out too soon@xcite because of the pareto - dominated nature of the venture . </S>",
    "<S> the feeling of being victimised is thus not at all surprising .    </S>",
