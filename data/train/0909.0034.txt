    "electromagnetic duality in yang - mills - higgs theories was proposed in the work of goddard , nuyts , and olive ( gno ) @xcite . in this work",
    "they consider a theory with gauge group @xmath7 and a scalar field @xmath8 in an arbitrary representation which spontaneously breaks @xmath7 to @xmath9 in such a way that @xmath10 is nontrivial , which is the necessary condition for the existence of topological monopoles .",
    "since then , the monopole s solutions@xcite and the electromagnetic duality conjecture@xcite were studied intensely in the particular case where the scalar field was in the adjoint representation . in this case",
    ", the unbroken gauge group @xmath9 necessarily has a @xmath11 factor which is generated by the scalar field vacuum solution .",
    "this @xmath11 factor guarantees that @xmath12 , in which case the theory can have monopole solutions which are a generalization of t hooft - polyakov solution",
    ". we shall call them @xmath13 monopoles . the bogomolnyi - prasad_sommerfield ( bps )",
    "@xmath13 monopoles are conjectured to be dual to particles in the adjoint representation in the dual theory for suitable supersymmetric theories@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "much less is known in the cases where @xmath8 is not in the adjoint representation and @xmath9 is semisimple . in these cases , since @xmath10 is a cyclic group @xmath0 or a product of cyclic groups , the monopoles are called @xmath0 monopoles . some general properties of these @xmath0 monopoles were analyzed in @xcite , and in @xcite it was proposed that the @xmath1 monopole in @xmath14 @xmath2 super yang - mills should satisfy a duality transformation which is alternative to the gno conjecture .",
    "one of the main motivations for the study of monopoles and electromagnetic dualities is their possible application to the problem of confinement in qcd .",
    "following the ideas of t hooft and mandelstam , the confinement of particles in qcd must be a phenomenon dual to confinement of monopoles in a superconductor . in this model",
    ", the formation of chromoelectric flux tubes in qcd must be due to a monopole condensate .",
    "however , it is not clear yet if this condensate is made of @xmath13 monopoles , @xmath0 monopoles , or dirac monopoles .",
    "there are some lattice results which indicate that confinement could be related to @xmath0 monopoles condensates@xcite .",
    "another more recent application of gno duality is in the geometric langlands program @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", the ideas of t hooft and mandelstam were applied to supersymmetric non - abelian theories which satisfy electromagnetic duality with @xmath13 monopoles . in particular in @xcite the confinement of @xmath13 monopoles by the formation of magnetic flux tubes or @xmath0 strings in soft broken @xmath15 super yang - mills theories with an arbitrary simple gauge group was analyzed .",
    "it was shown that the tensions of these @xmath0 strings satisfy the casimir scaling law in the bps limit , which is believed to be the behavior that the chromoelectric flux tubes in qcd must satisfy .",
    "this result indicates that these @xmath0 strings can be dual to qcd chomoelectric strings .    in order to understand better the properties of the @xmath0 monopoles , in the present work we obtain explicitly the asymptotic form of the @xmath1 monopoles in @xmath2 yang - mills - higgs theories with the gauge group broken to @xmath3 by a scalar in the @xmath4 representation of @xmath2 or its symmetric part . in this case",
    ", one could in principle embed the theory in a ( deformed ) @xmath16 @xmath2 super yang - mills with a hypermultiplet in the @xmath4 representation which has vanishing @xmath17 function , similarly to @xmath15 super yang - mills theory .    in the work of gno",
    ", they obtained that the possible magnetic weights of the @xmath0 monopoles must belong to the weight lattice @xmath18 of the dual unbroken gauge group @xmath19 , where @xmath20 means the covering group of @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic weights satisfy a further constraint to belong to particular cosets in @xmath18 . in order to obtain that constraint we used the fact that for a theory with an unbroken gauge group @xmath21 , the @xmath0 monopole s topological charge sectors are associated to the elements of the group @xmath22 which is a subgroup of @xmath23 , the center of the group @xmath20 .",
    "then , we used the result that the elements of @xmath23 are associated to cosets which are related to nodes of the extended dynkin diagram of @xmath19 related to the node @xmath24 by a symmetry transformation . therefore , the @xmath0 monopoles must be associated to weights of a subset of these cosets .",
    "this form of writing elements of the center of a group was also used to obtain @xmath0 strings solutions@xcite .",
    "then , using the elegant general construction of weinberg et al.@xcite for the monopoles in theories where the gauge group @xmath2 is broken to @xmath3 , we associated to each weight of the defining representation of the dual algebra @xmath5 a @xmath25 subalgebra and constructed explicitly a @xmath1 monopole asymptotic solution which we called fundamental , generalizing the @xmath1 monopole solution for the @xmath26 gauge group @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the result in @xcite where the authors concluded that the @xmath1 monopoles in these theories should be associated to weights in the coset with the highest weight of the defining representation of @xmath5 . from these fundamental @xmath1 monopoles we constructed other @xmath1 monopole asymptotic solutions . differently from weinberg s general construction where the @xmath0 monopole s topological charge sectors were associated to integers modulo @xmath27 , in our construction they are associated to cosets in the weight lattice @xmath18 , which gives in principle a larger number of possible monopoles .",
    "we construct the monopole solutions considering two symmetry breakings of @xmath28 to @xmath29 : one in which @xmath29 is invariant under outer automorphism and another in which it is invariant under cartan automorphism . in the first case ,",
    "the monopole s magnetic flux is in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath28 but @xmath27 must be odd , and in the second case the magnetic flux is not in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath28 .",
    "this general procedure can be generalized to other gauge groups .",
    "we expect that this explicit construction of the @xmath1 monopole asymptotic solutions can be useful in order to understand better the electromagnetic duality in the theories where the scalar field is not in the adjoint representation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we start in sec .",
    "2 giving some mathematical conventions .",
    "then , we give a brief review of the results of gno in sec .",
    "3 and explain in sec . 4 how the topological charge sectors of the @xmath0 monopoles are associated to particular cosets in the weight lattice @xmath18 . in sec . 5 ,",
    "we obtain two scalar field configurations which break @xmath28 to @xmath29 where for the first configuration @xmath29 is invariant under cartan automorphism and for the second configuration it is invariant under outer automorphism . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we construct the fundamental @xmath1 monopoles for both symmetry breaks .",
    "we also include an appendix where we analyze the center elements of @xmath30 .",
    "let us start by giving some conventions which will be used later on .",
    "let @xmath31 be the lie algebra of rank @xmath32 associated to the group @xmath7 .",
    "let us adopt the cartan - weyl basis .",
    "in this basis , the commutation relations read @xmath33 & = & \\left(\\alpha\\right)^{i}e_{\\alpha},\\label{3.1}\\\\ \\left[e_{\\alpha},e_{-\\alpha}\\right ] & = & \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\alpha^{2}}\\cdot h,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where generators @xmath34 , form a basis for the cartan subalgebra ( csa ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 are roots and the upper index in @xmath37 means the component @xmath38 of @xmath36 .    given a representation of @xmath31 , we can take a basis \\{@xmath39 } in which the elements of the csa , @xmath34 , are diagonal,@xmath40 the vector @xmath41 with the @xmath32 eigenvalues @xmath42 as components is called weight and @xmath39 is called weight state .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath43 , the simple roots of @xmath31 which is a basis of the root space and by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , the fundamental weights of @xmath31 .",
    "moreover we shall call @xmath46 the simple coroots and fundamental coweights respectively .",
    "they satisfy the relations@xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively simple roots and fundamental weights of the dual algebra @xmath50 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath51 the covering group of @xmath7 .",
    "then , the fundamental weights form a basis for the weight lattice of @xmath51,@xmath52 this lattice includes as a subset , the root lattice of @xmath7 , @xmath53 which has the simple roots @xmath54 as the basis . similarly , the fundamental coweights @xmath49 are the basis of the weight lattice of the dual group @xmath55@xmath56 which is also called the coweight lattice of @xmath51 and which has the root lattice of the dual group @xmath57(or coroot lattice of @xmath7)@xmath58 as a subset .",
    "in a theory with gauge group @xmath7 spontaneously broken to @xmath9 , the monopole s solutions are associated to elements of the second homotopy group@xmath59 this result implies that monopoles are associated with nontrivial elements of @xmath60 which correspond to trivial elements of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the relation ( [ 3.01 ] ) is equivalent to @xcite@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the unbroken subgroup of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore for simplicity , without loss of generality , we shall consider that @xmath7 is simply connected .",
    "let us therefore consider a yang - mills - higgs theory with gauge group @xmath7 which we shall consider to be simple and simply connected .",
    "let us also consider that in the theory there is a scalar @xmath8 in a representation @xmath64 of @xmath7 and @xmath65 is a vacuum configuration which spontaneously breaks @xmath7 to a subgroup @xmath9 , in such a way that @xmath10 is nontrivial , which allows the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "the generators of @xmath9 are those which annihilate @xmath65 , that is,@xmath66 we shall denote by @xmath67 the algebra formed by these generators .",
    "let us briefly review some general properties of these monopoles which will also be useful to fix our notation .",

    "then , using ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) , ( [ 5.0.2 ] ) , and ( [ eq:3.1d ] ) results that @xmath78 and therefore , @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , one can write @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the elements of the cartan subalgebra ( csa ) of @xmath67 and @xmath83 is a constant vector . note that in general , the elements of the csa of @xmath67 do not necessarily belong to the csa of @xmath31 , the lie algebra of @xmath7 . therefore , we shall denote by @xmath84 the generators of @xmath67 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 the generators of @xmath31 .",

    "they conjectured that the monopoles should be dual to particles in a theory with unbroken gauge group @xmath19 .",
    "let us now analyze how the different values of @xmath99 are associated to the different elements of @xmath100 or topological charge sectors ( [ 3.31 ] ) of the theory .",

    "such a way of writing the center elements is also quite useful to analyze the @xmath107 string solutions which appear when the gauge group @xmath7 is broken to its center group @xmath108@xcite@xcite@xcite . in @xcite the center group of some groups is analyzed in some more detail .",

    "moreover , @xmath0 monopoles will be in the same topological sector if their associated magnetic weights are in the same coset .",
    "in the next sections we will analyze the values the magnetic weights can take when the gauge group @xmath2 is broken to @xmath109",
    "let us now consider a yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath2 and with a scalar field @xmath8 in the representation which is the direct product @xmath4 of @xmath2 . in this case the theory can in principle",
