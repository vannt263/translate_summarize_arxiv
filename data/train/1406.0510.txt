    "furthermore , the majority of targets with colors discrepant from the visible rgbs are also classified as non - members based on their radial velocity . another source of bias may be due to comparing different stellar populations , e.g. rgbs vs main sequence stars .",
    "most chemical abundance studies of dwarf galaxies are based on the rgb population , and it is to these populations that we compare our sample throughout . in our analysis , we take into account our limited sampling of these galaxies , but caution the reader that minority populations in chemical abundance space may remain undetected .",
    "we observed two new deimos masks for and  v and one for and  x during an observing run on september 14 - 16 , 2012 , supplementing the previous deimos observations of both galaxies by @xcite .",

    "recently , @xcite found a hint of such a short sfh in their analysis of hst / wfpc2 data , but their and  vii photometry was too shallow .",
    "deeper photometry should place interesting constraints on its sfh .    in spite of and  vii s overall chemical abundance trend ,",
    "a few low alpha abundance outliers are present at low metallicities .",
    "the occurrence of these low @xmath0 $ ] stars could be the explained if and  vii s abundance pattern is the sum of more than one stellar population each with different star formation characteristics .",
    "the low alpha , low @xmath81 $ ] stars could then be explained as coming from the secondary stellar population , e.g. from satellite - satellite accretion , or from a dissolved star cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if so , the secondary system would have to be a smaller population in order not to dominate the overall @xmath98}}-{\\ensuremath{[\\rm{fe / h}]}}$ ] abundance pattern .",
    "example of anomalous abundance patterns are also found in other environments , such as the milky way halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are interpreted similarly but in the context of halo formation .",
    "an alternate explanation is that star formation was dominated by bursts , leading to repeated enhancement in alpha from type  ii sne @xcite .",
    "the presence of these low alpha stars would then be consistent with stars formed in the time between bursts , when type  ia sne acted to decrease @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed satellites , and  ii and the brighter systems ( ngc  185 , ngc  147 , and m32 ) built their stellar populations more gradually , and reached @xmath271% of their total mass by @xmath272 gyr ago in the case of and  ii @xcite and 2 - 4 gyr ago for the others @xcite .",

    "ngc  147 , while having a high average alpha abundance for , may reach low alpha abundances for its highest metallicity stars . this pattern may imply that an abundance `` knee '' in ngc  147 , indicative of the onset of type  ia enrichment appears at a very high metallicity , suggesting a very efficient initial chemical enrichment .",
    "however , the alpha abundances for are uncertain due to the lack of a calibrator sample for our @xmath0 $ ] correction term (   [ ssec_analysis ] ) .",
    "the presence of many stars with low alpha abundances in and  ii , ngc  185 , and ngc  147 is consistent with a long lasting star formation process . in addition , and  ii and ngc  185 show large scatter in their @xmath0$]-@xmath81 $ ] plane at fixed @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "this may simply reflect some level of inhomogeneous chemical enrichment , such that not all ism regions are polluted with the same amounts of type  ii and type  ia products . an alternate way to explain this scatter may be to postulate the presence of more than one track in @xmath0$]-@xmath81 $ ] space , thus boosting the scatter at fixed metallicity .",
    "if so , these populations should be mixed radially , in order to be consistent with the lack of radial alpha abundance gradients discussed in   [ ssec_radial ] .",
    "one way to probe this is by checking whether there are age differences between the high and low alpha abundance stars at a fixed metallicity .      in @xmath82cdm ,",

    "we thus combine our dwarf galaxy samples into a single @xmath0$]-@xmath81 $ ] distribution . however , simply looking at the raw distributions of stars in our sample is incorrect .",
    "this is because the variable crowding of stars and limited size of our slitmasks prevents a uniform sampling of the m31 satellites .",
    "hence , we weight each star to take into account the the stellar mass of each galaxy ( @xmath275 ) , and the luminosity function of m31 galaxies .",
    "we assign a weight to each star in our sample for galaxy _ j _ , using equation  [ eqn : weights ] , where the index @xmath276 represents the sample s galaxies ordered by luminosity .",

    "j_. for the m31 dwarf satellite luminosity function , we assume a simple functional form with two broken linear slopes , which roughly approximates the trend presented in the left panel of figure  1 by @xcite .",
    "we then use the weights _ w _ to create _ w _ samples of each star , each with the same @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath0 $ ] values as the original stars .",
    "this corrects for our non - uniform sampling of each dwarf galaxy s stars , as well as the fact that we have a larger fraction of the bright m31 satellites in our sample , but only a few of the faint ones .",
    "we have excluded m32 from all following comparisons because we lack a representative sample ( only five stars ) , and because it is a very unusual object @xcite , so that its contribution to a stellar halo may not be important in most cases .",
    "we compare the distribution of alpha abundances between the combined m31 satellite sample and the present day mw halo as a function of metallicity .",
    "we choose the same metallicity bins as in figure  [ fig : alphafe_luminosity ] .",
    "for the mw halo comparison sample , we use the very high - resolution data by @xcite , who subdivide their population into inner and outer halo populations based on stellar kinematics .",
    "we only use stars in that sample for which all of [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ /fe ] are measured .",
    "we define @xmath0 $ ] for the mw sample as the unweighted mean of all four abundance ratios , consistent with the definition for our sample ( see   [ ssec_analysis ] ) . the typical uncertainty in @xmath0 $ ] for the halo stars , @xmath279 dex , is smaller than for our m31 measurements . for a more appropriate m31-mw comparison ,",
    "we add gaussian noise to each individual mw halo @xmath0 $ ] value , such that their typical @xmath0 $ ] uncertainty is then comparable to that of m31 satellite stars .",
    "we create @xmath280 realizations of each mw halo @xmath0 $ ] measurement using different random seeds .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo_afe ] shows histograms of the distribution in @xmath0 $ ] for the three metallicity bins that encompass most of our data and that of the mw stars ( the same bins as in figure  [ fig : alphafe_luminosity ] ) .",
    "all histograms have been normalized to their peak value . for all three bins ,",
    "both the mw inner and outer halo and m31 satellite samples are alpha - enhanced .",
    "the peak of the m31 samples are higher than the mw halo samples by @xmath281 dex , with the difference being largest in the lowest metallicity bin .",
    "differences in @xmath0 $ ] between the inner / outer mw halo have been reported by @xcite and @xcite , but as seen from the plot , are too small to be measurable when convolving the mw data with our typical data uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the inner and outer mw halo samples separately .",
    "we formally compare the @xmath0 $ ] distributions by performing k - s tests between ( a ) the m31 satellite sample from old satellites only , ( b ) all satellites including those with intermediate age satellites ) , against the mw halo samples , ( 1 ) inner halo , and ( 2 ) outer halo .",
    "we perform this comparison at each metallicity bin , resulting in twelve comparison pairs .",
    "we use the associated p@xmath263 values to assess whether the samples are inconsistent with being drawn from the same distribution . for each comparison , we recalculate p@xmath263 by randomly sampling 400 subpopulations each with the same number of stars as the raw data samples ( table  [ table : abundances ] ) .",
    "this results in 400 estimates of p@xmath263 for each comparison . in every comparison of mw halo versus",
    "all ( i.e. , old plus intermediate age ) m31 satellites , the p@xmath263 values are less than @xmath282 . for the comparisons with old - only m31 satellites , the majority of realizations of p@xmath263 peak at @xmath283 , in all but two of the comparisons .",
    "we conclude that the data is inconsistent with the mw halo and m31 dwarf satellite samples being drawn from the same parent distribution with more than 90% confidence , except for small regions in @xmath98}}-{\\ensuremath{[\\rm{fe / h}]}}\\,$ ] space .",
    "the overall difference in @xmath0 $ ] suggests that a halo made up of destroyed m31 dwarf satellites ( or satellites sharing their chemical evolution properties ) could not have been the primary contributor to a mw - like halo .",
    "we next compare the metallicity distribution from m31 satellites to that of the mw halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo_feh ] plots the metallicity distributions .",
    "the red histogram plots the subsample of dwarf galaxies thought to be mainly old ( and  i , and  iii , and  v , and  vii ) .",
    "the blue histogram also incorporates and  ii , ngc  185 and ngc  147 , which have moderate to strong evidence for significant intermediate age populations ( see brief age discussion in   [ ssec_disc_evolution ] ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows from the different histogram peaks that a halo made up of old m31 satellites would be more metal - poor than one which includes the dwarf galaxies with intermediate age populations . this is a reflection of the metallicity - luminosity relation @xcite , since the satellites in our sample with intermediate populations also tend to be the most luminous .",
    "we compare the peaks of our histograms to the peak metallicities of the mw inner and outer halo from @xcite as vertical lines at @xmath97}}= -1.6 $ ] and @xmath97}}= -2.2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy of peak iron abundances strongly implies that a halo made up of satellites like those of m31 would result in a halo population too metal - rich in comparison to the mw halo , regardless of the exclusion of satellites with intermediate age populations .",
    "the comparison of alpha abundances and metallicity distributions shows that a mw halo could not be formed from a population of present - day m31 satellites , even if we only consider those satellites with predominately old stellar populations .",
    "thus , the old population dwarf galaxies that formed the mw halo were different from both the present - day `` old '' mw dwarf galaxies and `` old '' m31 satellites , as has also been suggested in simulations by @xcite in the context of the mw halo formation .",
    "we have measured alpha abundance ratios and stellar metallicities for 226 individual rgb stars in nine dwarf galaxies of m31 .",
    "we first summarize the results internal to our sample :    1 .",
    "the stellar populations of the m31 dwarf galaxies show a variety of `` internal '' @xmath0$]-@xmath81 $ ] abundance patterns , including flat trends of @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath81 $ ] ( e.g. , and  vii ) , and decreasing @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath81 $ ] ( e.g. , and  v ) .",
    "the average alpha abundances ratios vary between galaxies from solar , to alpha - enhanced , indicating a range in star formation timescales .",
    "the average alpha abundance ratios are not significantly correlated with galaxy luminosity , distance from m31 ( i.e. , environment ) , stellar kinematics , or surface brightness .",
    "4 .   the variation in alpha abundances between m31 dwarf galaxies with m@xmath241 is larger at higher metallicities , @xmath81$]@xmath284 .",
    "we confirm significant radial iron abundance gradients in two galaxies out of the five with sufficient data ( ngc  185 and and  ii ) .",
    "there is only tentative evidence for an alpha abundance radial gradient in ngc  185 .",
    "we have homogeneously compared our sample to a sample of milky way dwarf galaxy satellites , as well as to a literature sample of milky way inner and outer halo populations .",
    "we summarize the conclusions from these comparisons below :    1 .   for",

    ", we compare the population of m31 satellites to the milky way stellar halo . a stellar halo made from disrupted m31 dwarf satellites",
    "would be more iron - rich _ and _ have a different alpha abundance distribution than the milky way halo .",
    "this holds both for old m31 satellites and those with younger stellar populations .",
    "therefore , the milky way stellar halo could not be formed from a population of dwarf galaxies with chemical properties like the present - day m31 satellites .",
    "the measurements of alpha abundances for m31 satellites constitute an important contribution to our growing understanding of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the combination of accurate age distributions and chemical information ( e.g. , @xmath0$]@xmath83@xmath81 $ ] distributions , metallicity distribution functions , radial abundance gradients ) will help in understanding the detailed evolution in these systems , thus expanding galactic archaeology beyond the milky way .",
    "studies of m31 galaxies are also complemented by those of nearby field dwarf galaxies at comparable distances .    with the study of the m31 dwarf galaxies ( and systems at similar distances ) , we approach the limit of capabilities for medium@xmath83resolution spectroscopy of individual rgb stars with 8 - 10 meter class telescopes . within the current telescope constraints , chemical abundance measurements of more distant stellar populations",
