    "in this paper we take some first steps towards a classification of ( self - similar ) directed graph ifss defined on the unit interval . directed graph ifss , also known as graph directed ifss , are one of the largest classes of deterministic ifss .",
    "probabilistic ifss are often constructed by introducing random elements into the machinery of deterministic ifss , see for example @xcite , so our results should be of interest across the whole range of ifs theory .",
    "the cantor set , the sierpinsky triangle and the menger sponge are well known examples of fractal sets and each of them can be defined as the attractor of a ( self - similar ) @xmath3-vertex directed graph ifs , where the defining contractions are contracting similarities . for this reason it is convenient to use _ standard ifs _ to mean a ( self - similar ) @xmath3-vertex directed graph ifs .",
    "also we will often write _ @xmath1-vertex ifs _ as a shortening of ( self - similar ) @xmath1-vertex directed graph ifs .",
    "any @xmath1-vertex ifs determines a unique ( @xmath1-component ) attractor under the terms of the contraction mapping theorem so it is natural to try and classify them by distinguishing between the components of their attractors .",
    "this we do in theorems [ p2 m ] and [ p2q ] where we identify many new families of @xmath1-vertex ( @xmath2 , cssc ) ifss , defined on the unit interval , whose attractors have components that are not standard ifs attractors , where the standard ifs may be with or without separation conditions , overlapping or otherwise .",
    "these results considerably extend those of @xcite where it was established that standard ifss are in fact a proper subclass of directed graph ifss .",
    "overall the work of this paper means that we can expect most @xmath1-vertex ( @xmath2 , cssc ) ifss to have attractors with components that are not standard ifs attractors .",
    "in particular the categorical nature of theorem [ p2 m ] suggests that a precise classification is a real possibility .",
    "we discuss ways in which further progress may be made in section [ six ] .",
    "these results are also of interest because they provide information about properties that standard overlapping ifs attractors do nt have .",
    "this is useful because apart from results about their hausdorff dimension , see for example @xcite , little is known about the structure of the attractors of overlapping ifss in general .",
    "theorem [ p2 m ] applies to one of the simplest types of @xmath0-vertex ifss that can be defined on the unit interval as illustrated in figure [ p22vertexunitinterval ] .",
    "the attractor of these systems consists of two non - empty compact sets , one at each vertex , which we write as @xmath4 .",
    "two of the results we proved in @xcite about these @xmath0-vertex ifs attractors are as follows , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "then @xmath11 is not the attractor of any standard ifs , defined on @xmath12 , with or without separation conditions .",
    "we note that the standard ifss in the statement of theorem [ 2gthmu ] may have defining similarities which reflect .",
    "whilst it should be clear from their proofs , we point out here that all the ifss referred to in the statements of theorems [ p2 m ] , [ p2q ] and [ p2 t ] that follow , are assumed to have defining similarities that do not reflect and this is also the case for all the similarities depicted in diagrams in this paper .",
    "in fact it is not difficult to adjust theorems [ p2q ] and [ p2 t ] so that they apply if reflecting similarities are allowed and we describe how this may be done in the comment after theorem [ p2 t ] below .",
