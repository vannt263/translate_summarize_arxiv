    "the exchange coupling between ferromagnetic metal sandwiches across non - magnetic and antiferromagnetic spacers is a known interesting phenomenon , which is understood by various theories using e.g.  the different reflection and interference properties of electronic waves of different spin polarization in the systems considered , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that the above - mentioned coupling depends in an oscillatory way not only on the thickness of the spacer , but also on the thicknesses of the magnetic layers of the system , @xcite , which offers additional possibilities to tune the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "finally , all these properties are interesting with respect to possible applications , e.g.  by using such systems as magneto - resistive reading - heads in magnetic storage devices , since e.g.  the resistance strongly depends on the mutual orientation of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layers , which is known as gmr - effect , see e.g.  @xcite .    to cope with the rapidly extending experimental possibilities to study ternary and even more complex systems by using e.g.  double - wedge techniques,@xcite , we have extended our _ ab - initio _ calculations to complex binary and ternary systems with up to 20 non - equivalent layers .",
    "such _ ab - initio _ calculations have already been used successfully by various groups , e.g.  @xcite , and although they typically overestimate the amplitude of the thickness oscillations of the exchange interaction by one order of magnitude compared to experiments , the wavelengths and phases are reliably calculated , as shown e.g.  by a comparison , performed in @xcite , of results from @xcite with results obtained by the present method .",
    "as in @xcite , we use the first - principles lmto package of anderson and jepsen , @xcite , in its non - relativistic version and in the atomic - sphere approximation , but with all important corrections , by which : @xmath0 the accuracy of the k - space integrals is enhanced and @xmath1 the overlapping and empty parts of the elementary wigner - seitz - cell and  at the same time  higher angular momenta are taken into account . in the simplest case ,",
    "the systems considered are of the kind ( n@xmath2m@xmath2/n@xmath3m@xmath3)@xmath4 , where m@xmath2 and m@xmath3 are the magnetic or spacer metals , respectively , while the n@xmath5 denote the numbers of respective layers , and ( ... ) @xmath4 reminds to the periodic continuation of the antiferromagnetic unit cell , which comprises 2(n@xmath2+n@xmath3 ) atoms , in all three directions .",
    "the interface orientations considered are ( 0,0,1 ) and ( 0,1,1 ) , but below we only present results for the ( 0,0,1 ) case .",
    "the exchange interaction @xmath6 is obtained from the energy difference @xmath7 for the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic orientation of this unit cell by the equation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the area of the unit cell .",
    "thus @xmath10 means ferromagnetic coupling .    in @xcite",
    "we have already studied the influence of ni replacing co at the interfaces of a ( co@xmath11/cu@xmath12)@xmath4 multilayers and found a _ weakening _ of the interaction by almost a factor @xmath13 0.25 , and a _ phase shift _ of the @xmath14-vs.-@xmath15 oscillations by almost one monolayer to the right for the corresponding ( ni - co@xmath3ni / cu@xmath12 ) systems . here",
    "we find that also the magnetization of the ni layers is _ drastically influenced _ by its position with respect to the interface .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "1a : there the ni moment is strongly reduced at the interface , i.e.  from the bulk value 0.6 to @xmath16 , whereas in the central position of a ni@xmath17 sandwich one obtains a 10 % enhancement , and for the ni@xmath18 sandwiches even an oscillatory behaviour , with enhanced values at layers 3 and 5 , but a reduction almost to the bulk value at the central layer 4 .",
    "another interesting observation is a significant _ induced polarization _ , @xmath19 , of the cu layers at the interface .",
    "interestingly , this cu polarization is _ antiparallel _ to that of ni , whereas it would be _ parallel _ to co at the corresponding co / cu interface , as we have found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find for a ternary system ( nico@xmath12nicu@xmath3)@xmath4 in fig .",
    "1b that the induced cu moments mainly see the neighbouring ni layer ond not the co layers beyond .",
    "finally we found from systems with @xmath20 cu layers that the induced cu polarization is typically reduced by a factor of @xmath21 at the 2nd cu layer near the interface , with respect to that of the 1st layer , i.e.  there is again a significant polarization , and no change of sign , in layer 2 .",
    "this should be contrasted to the situation with a co / cu interface , where  as already mentioned  the 1st cu layer at the interface is polarized antiparallel to co ( @xmath22 ) , whereas the 2nd layer must be polarized parallel to co ( @xmath23 ) , see @xcite . in any case",
    "it should be noted that : @xmath0 such small induced cu moments of the order of 0.01 @xmath24 can be measured by x - ray circular dichroism , @xcite , and @xmath1 that , according to our results , cu layers , which are _ more _ than two monolayers away from the interface , are practically unpolarized .",
    "fig.2 shows that the _ exchange _ interaction between the magnetic slabs in ternary multilayers of co , ni and cu changes drastically with the details of the compositioni and the position of the various layers . e.g.  for the co - based multilayers of the lower curve in fig .  2 , ( ni - co@xmath11-ni / cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( co - ni - co@xmath3-ni - co / cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( co@xmath3-ni@xmath3-co@xmath3/cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( co@xmath25/cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , the exchange between the magnetic slabs is _ antiferromagnetic _ , i.e. @xmath26 : for the first system , with one ni layer at the interface , it is rather weak , but it becomes very strong when the ni layer moves into the interior of the co sandwich , i.e. for the 2nd and 3rd point of the lower curve . in contrast , for the ni - based multilayers of the upper curves , the exchange _ alternates _ from antiferromagnetic ( @xmath27 ) to ferromagnetic sign ( @xmath28 ) and _ vice versa _ in the sequence ( co - ni@xmath11-co / cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( ni - co - ni@xmath3-ci - ni / cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( ni@xmath3-co@xmath3-ni@xmath3/cu@xmath3)@xmath4 , ( ni@xmath25/cu@xmath3)@xmath4 . generally speaking ,",
    "the magnitude of the exchange is stronger when co , and not ni , is at the interface .",
    "finally we have studied ( fe@xmath12/v@xmath29)@xmath4-multilayers . this system is interesting on the following reason : v would be nonmagnetic as a bulk metal .",
    "however , in the above - mentioned multilayers we have found that the first v layer at the ( 001)-interface is strongly polarized , @xmath30 , antiparallel to fe .",
    "but in contrast to cr , all other v layers are non - polarized .",
    "also the exchange interaction @xmath6 of such systems shows strong oscillations as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath31 , see fig .",
