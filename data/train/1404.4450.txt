    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have been used with great success as standardizable candles , allowing for the measurement of cosmological parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "sne ia are also of great importance for galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely accepted that they are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "the compact , degenerate structure of the exploding stars in  was recently confirmed by early - time multiwavelength observations of sn2011fe @xcite . however , the nature of  progenitors is still unclear ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the models for the progenitors of sn  ia fall into two categories : the single degenerate ( sd ) model @xcite and the double degenerate ( dd ) model @xcite . in the standard sd - model a wd accretes matter from a non - degenerate companion , which may be a main - sequence , subgiant , or red giant star . in order to grow ,",
    "a wd must accumulate mass via nuclear - burning of hydrogen into helium , and helium into carbon and oxygen .",
    "when the wd mass reaches @xmath1 , the wd explodes as an sn  ia .",
    "however , theoretical and observational challenges persist for both scenarios .",
    "the fundamental difficulty for the sd - model is the narrow range of accretion rates ( @xmath2few@xmath3 ) for which steady nuclear - burning and efficient accumulation of mass by the wd is possible @xcite .",
    "this requires specific combinations of donor and accretor masses , restricting the typical delay time between formation of a binary and a  by @xmath21 gyr , and similarly the peak production of  in this channel within a similar delay time .",
    "another problem is the treatment of the excess matter which can not be processed through steady nuclear - burning .",
    "this is typically _ assumed _ either to form an extended envelope around the wd , leading to the formation of a common envelope , or to be lost from the system in the form of an optically thick wind .",
    "therefore , the viability of the sd - scenario depends critically on the treatment of mass transfer and resulting accretion rate , which defines whether the wd may , presumably grow in mass .",
    "white dwarfs with different accretion rates are associated with different sources and phenomena , e.g. supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) and novae . comparing observations with the number of ssss and the nova rate predicted by population synthesis models",
    "can be used to verify calculations , and also to constrain the sd - channel .",
    "because of the relatively high mass transfer rates needed to sustain steady nuclear burning , these sources are almost always associated with mass transfer on the donor s thermal timescale ( thermal timescale mass transfer , ttmt ) . in binary population synthesis codes",
    ", ttmt is typically accounted for using a simple analytic treatment .",
    "however , such analysis typically assumes implicitly that the donor star remains in _ thermal equilibrium _",
    ", with the entire star ( or at least its entire envelope ) responding at once , despite mass transfer being driven by the _ thermal disequilibrium _ of the donor ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly important in treating mass loss from red giants  detailed calculations reveal that the rapid expansion of the donor envelope in response to mass transfer , expected in the simplified treatment of adiabatic models @xcite , does not necessarily occur @xcite .",
    "this is critical in determining the circumstances under which a binary will undergo a common envelope ( ce ) phase . in those cases where the binary will undergo a ce regardless , it is also possible that some mass may be accreted prior to this phase , and any accreting wd may appear briefly as an sss .",
    "this is unaccounted for in the traditional treatment of mass transfer in population synthesis .    in this paper ( paper i )",
    ", we investigate in detail mass transfer in the semidetached systems with nuclear - burning wd ( nbwd ) accretors and main - sequence , hertzsprung gap and red - giant donors .",
    "we pay special attention to the systems in which wds burn hydrogen steadily ( snbwds ) and to the systems with accretion rates exceeding the upper limit for steady burning , but too low for the formation of a common envelope , (  rapidly accreting white dwarfs ",
    "( rawds ) , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hydrogen - helium envelope atop a hot ( @xmath4 ) carbon - oxygen wd transforms it into a red giant ( @xmath5 ) ; this may be avoided , if excess of the matter is removed by postulated optically - thick stellar wind @xcite . ] for this , we produce a grid of @xmath6 evolutionary sequences of close binary models with different initial combinations of wd accretors and nondegenerate donors , and with differing orbital periods at the onset of roche lobe overflow , calculated by the detailed stellar evolutionary code @xcite .",
    "our models are compared with the ones obtained using analytic descriptions of mass - transfer . in order to relate our work to observations",
    ", we compare the predicted evolution of the numbers of snbwd , rawd , and the rates of  given two star formation histories : an instantaneous burst of star formation , and a constant star formation rate for 10gyr , approximating early and late type galaxies respectively . in a subsequent paper ( hereafter paper ii )",
    ", we will incorporate spectral models for nuclear - burning white dwarfs .",
    "this will allow us to more meaningfully test the predictions of our model .",
    "we describe the method of calculations in  [ sec : method ] , highlight the effect of varying treatments of ttmt in @xmath7[ttmt ] , follow with a discussion of how some observables vary with changing mt treatment in  [ sec : res ] , in particular the predicted populations of rawds , snbwds , and .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the method applied to study different populations of binary stars and the products of their evolution is binary population synthesis ( bps ) . in population synthesis ,",
    "one convolves the statistical data on initial parameters and birthrates of binaries with scenarios for their evolution .",
    "this allows one to study birthrates and numbers of binaries of different classes and their distributions over observable parameters .",
    "there are two basic algorithms applied to study semidetached stages of evolution in bps codes .",
    "the `` rapid '' one employs analytic formulae , approximating each evolutionary phase using simple fits from detailed calculations .",
    "mass transfer is accounted for by calculating the radial response of the donor star and its roche radius .",
    "alternatively , one may employ a `` hybrid '' approach which entails two steps .",
    "relevant to our present study , first we obtain the population of wd binaries with nondegenerate donors at the onset of mass transfer by means of a bps code . here",
    "we use the publicly available code @xcite , which we have modified slightly ( see below ) . in the second step , in order to obtain an accurate description of post - rlof mass - loss rates , we compute the mass transfer rate and response of the donors in this population by drawing from a grid of @xmath8 evolutionary sequences of models for wds with ms , hg or fgb companions computed by @xcite , in practice , using about @xmath24000 such tracks . the advantage of this approach is the possibility to describe  accounting for the response of the donor .",
    "this also allows one to avoid the exclusion of any short evolutionary stages .",
    "it is known from the earliest studies of close interacting binaries ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that , depending on the evolutionary status of the roche - lobe - overflowing star ( the donor ) and the mass ratio of the components , the donor may lose mass on a timescale defined by the dynamical , thermal , or nuclear evolution of the donor , or the loss of angular momentum . in practice , this means that the mass - loss rate depends on relations between the response of the roche lobe radius to mass loss @xmath9 , the adiabatic hydrostatic response of the stellar radius @xmath10 , the thermal - equilibrium response of the same @xmath11 , the nuclear evolution of the radius , and finally the angular momentum loss timescale . if @xmath12 , the star remains in hydrostatic equilibrium , but does not remain in thermal equilibrium ; in this case mass loss occurs on the thermal timescale of the star .",
    "if @xmath13 , the star can not remain in hydrostatic equilibrium , and mass loss proceeds on the dynamical timescale . if @xmath14 , mass loss occurs due to the expansion of the star during its evolution on the nuclear timescale , or due to the shrinkage of the roche lobe owed to angular momentum losses .",
    "dynamical or thermal timescale mass loss is common for initial stages of mass exchange . in `` rapid '' bps",
    "codes it is assumed that , if rlof leads to dynamical mass loss ( according to some assumed criteria ) , then the formation of a common envelope is unavoidable . in this case , no further computations of the mass transfer rate or the response of the donor star are carried out . mass loss is assumed to occur on the thermal timescale if , after removal of an infinitesimally small amount of mass , the radius of the star in thermal equilibrium is predicted to be larger than the ( volume - averaged ) roche lobe radius . in the simplest formulation , the mass loss rate is approximated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the roche -lobe filling star and @xmath17 is an estimate of the thermal timescale . in general , the definition of @xmath18 is not unique and differs between codes because of our present lack of understanding of what fraction of the star is involved in mass exchange ( i.e. to what depth to we evaluate @xmath19 ? ) .",
    "then , typically , one writes @xmath20 , where , in the simplest cases , @xmath211 , @xmath22 is the instantaneous total mass of the star or the mass of the stellar envelope . in slightly more sophisticated cases , @xmath23 may be a function of the mass - radius response functions of the donor and its roche radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , for @xmath24  and @xmath25 the values corresponding to stars in * thermal equilibrium * are usually taken , despite mass transfer being driven by the * thermal disequilibrium * of the donor star . as a result , just after rlof @xmath26 is constant or slowly declining as @xmath27 falls ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] below ) .",
    "however , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) clearly showed that equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdot_th ] ) provide only the order of magnitude of the mass transfer rate .",
    "although detailed calculations accounting for the response of the donor are preferable , the use of the `` hybrid '' technique has so far been limited by the available computing power . if too crude a grid of evolutionary models is used , it may result in spurious effects . only recently , with the advent of the rapid and robust stellar evolutionary code , has it become possible to increase the number of sufficiently detailed tracks by an order of magnitude , to several 10,000 , which can be used to adequately describe the evolution of a parental population of @xmath28 systems .",
    "earlier , grids of detailed evolutionary tracks leading to the systems or events of desired type were combined with detailed bps codes , e.g. , by @xcite for low and intermediate mass x - ray binaries , @xcite for sne ia in semidetached systems , @xcite for ultraluminous x - ray sources . advantages of this method were recently discussed by @xcite . in this paper , we present the first attempt to use grids of tracks computed by to investigate accreting wds .      in this paper",
    ", we employ both the `` hybrid '' approach and the `` rapid '' approach described above . in either case , each evolutionary track for every binary must be scaled by a relative `` weight '' which accounts for the total number of binaries the track represents . to evaluate the relative `` weight '' of a binary , we take the imf of primaries from @xcite with lower and upper mass cutoffs @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we adopt a flat mass ratio distribution @xcite .",
    "binary separations in the range between @xmath31  and @xmath32 are drawn from a flat distribution in logarithmic space @xcite .",

    "this is not difficult to understand , since most white dwarf binaries in the post - ce white dwarf binary population have relatively small - mass wds @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lower mass wds can accrete more mass in binaries with the same donor mass and orbital periods @xcite .",
    "note that contribution of systems with red giant donors is insignificant in our calculation .",
    "note , in our calculations , we do not consider possible atmospheric mass loss @xcite or enhancement of stellar winds of rg close to rolf @xcite , which may delay embedding of the potentially unstable system into common envelope at the instant of rlof ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is widely understood that the outcome of ce evolution suffers from many uncertainties , such as the available sources of energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "given the uncertainty of ce evolution , we performed a set of calculations of the model b1 increasing @xmath85 to 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_sss_sne_diff_alpha ] , we compare the evolution of snbwds and sne ia rate in the starburst case for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we found that there is no dramatic difference between @xmath111 and @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath110 , snbwd , as well as sn  ia events appear slightly later than for @xmath109 , since after the first common envelope episode systems are wider .",

    "[ fig : lumdiffdonor ] ,  [ fig : nsssdiffdonor ] and  [ fig : snburst ] , one may note that the curves are noisy .",
    "this problem is commonly seen in population synthesis studies .",
    "there are several reasons for that , both in our -only calculation as well as in our + calculation , the primary causes being :    * in our -only calculation , one cause for the noise is that we have adopted several different ce criteria for different binaries .",
    "this is especially important for those binaries that begin mass transfer on the hg , which evolve to the rg phase prior to the end of the mass transfer phase .",
    "typically , our hg - donor tracks end abruptly when they violate the stability condition of @xcite .",
    "however , just prior to this , many tracks `` dip back '' into the stable burning regime . whether this occurs or not does not depend smoothly on the time of onset of mass transfer , therefore introducing small variations in the numbers and luminosity of snbwds predicted in our calculations . *",
    "in addition to this , the limited number of tracks in the calculation will also contribute to the noise .",
    "in particular , in our + calculations , we perform a mapping from a set of @xmath2 100,000 tracks produced by , to one of @xmath2 30,000 tracks produced by mesa .",
    "the discontinuous transition from our grid to a much coarse grid of tracks introduces unphysical variability in our output . * finally , the noise in the fig .",
    "[ fig : snburst ] is primarily due to the small number of binary tracks which explode as sne ia .",
    "in this work , we combined the population synthesis code with the detailed stellar evolutionary code for the first time , in order to study the population of accreting wds .",
    "we also compared the output from this with the results obtained applying a `` rapid '' algorithm , using alone . with these two bps algorithms , we investigated the evolution of the number of rapidly accreting white dwarfs , stable nuclear burning white dwarfs and the sne ia rate in elliptical and spiral - like galaxies .",
    "in addition to confirming that the sd channel is subdominant in producing the overall sn ia rate , we also evaluated the effect of implementing differing treatments of mass transfer for the results of bps calculations .    comparing the two versions of our binary population synthesis calculations",
    ", we found that the mass transfer prescription in bps is especially important for calculating the number and total luminosity of nuclear - burning white dwarfs in elliptical galaxies at early and late epochs ( from initial starburst ) .",
    "we argue that this also partially explains the differences in sne  ia rates and dtd obtained by different binary population synthesis groups .",
    "we found that rawds appear earlier in our model compared with -only , due to the accreting wds with massive donors found in the former .",
    "we find that there is a factor of @xmath105 3 difference between the results of our calculations using a fitting formula for the binding parameter @xmath47 @xcite and a constant @xmath112 , and our calculations using a constant @xmath113 .    in our model",
    ", we found that the number of rawds at 10 gyr is @xmath114 for an elliptical galaxy of @xmath115  and @xmath116 for a spiral - like galaxy of the same mass .",
    "this result is in stark contrast with zero rawds predicted in our calculation for a model elliptical galaxy using alone .",
    "we find that the number of snbwd is @xmath117 in our model elliptical - like galaxy and @xmath118 in our model spiral - like galaxy ( both with @xmath119at 10 gyr ) .",

    "our dtd for the sd - model is inconsistent with the observed dtd @xmath121 .",
    "if we assume that rawds do not exist , but rather that a common envelope is formed if the accretion rate onto a wd is larger that the upper limit for stable hydrogen burning , then the rate of  produced by the sd - channel becomes negligible .    to conclude our discussion of the significance of the sd - channel for the production of",
    ", we note the following .",
    "since wds in the steady burning phase can effectively accumulate mass , it is widely suggested that ssss be identified with the progenitors of sne ia and , therefore , observations of ssss may be useful for constraining the sd model .",
    "@xcite estimated the expected x - ray flux from the progenitors of sne ia in the sd - scenario for elliptical galaxies based on the observed supernova rate .",
    "they found that the observed x - ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies is @xmath122 times smaller than the predicted value , and constrain the contribution of the sd - channel to @xmath101 . in a similar way",
    ", @xcite found that there are too few ssss to account for the sne ia rate . even if accreting wds radiate at significantly lower temperatures ( t@xmath123 ) , due to the inflation of their photospheres ,",
    "the sd channel may still be limited to providing @xmath124 of the  rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite considered the possibility that some ssss may reside in wind - accreting systems which later produce double - degenerate systems ( symbiotic stars ) , and estimated their number in the galaxy as @xmath125 , while the estimate by @xcite is even lower : @xmath126 .",
    "though several @xmath127  snbwds in the model is apparently a large number , it is still about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that necessary to be consistent with the observationally inferred galactic  rate . @xcite and @xcite estimated that in wind - fed systems wd typically accrete no more than @xmath1050.1 .",
