    "in this paper we study a version of the dynamical systems method ( dsm ) ( see @xcite ) for solving the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonlinear , twice frchet differentiable , monotone operator in a real hilbert space @xmath2 , and equation is assumed solvable , possibly nonuniquely .",
    "monotonicity means that @xmath3 equations with monotone operators are important in many applications and were studied extensively , see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "one encounters many technical and physical problems with such operators in the cases where dissipation of energy occurs .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , chapter 3 , pp.156 - 189 , a wide class of nonlinear dissipative systems is studied , and the basic equations of such systems can be reduced to equation with monotone operators .",
    "numerous examples of equations with monotone operators can be found in @xcite and references mentioned above . in @xcite and @xcite it",
    "is proved that any solvable linear operator equation with a closed , densely defined operator in a hilbert space @xmath2 can be reduced to an equation with a monotone operator and solved by a convergent iterative process .    in this paper , apparently for the first time",
    ", the convergence of the dynamical systems gradient method is proved under natural assumptions and convergence of a corresponding iterative method is established .",
    "no special assumptions of smallness of the nonlinearity or other special properties of the nonlinearity are imposed .",
    "no source - type assumptions are used .",
    "consequently , our result is quite general and widely applicable .",
    "it is well known , that without extra assumptions , usually , source - type assumption about the right - hand side , or some assumption concerning the smoothness of the solution , one can not get a specific rate of convergence even for linear ill - posed equations ( see , for example , @xcite , where one can find a proof of this statement ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such assumptions are often difficult to verify and often they do not hold . by this reason we do not make such assumptions .",
    "the result of this paper is useful both because of its many possible applications and because of its general nature .",
    "our novel technique consists of an application of some new inequalities .",
    "our main results are formulated in theorems [ mainthm ] and [ mainthm2 ] , and also in several lemmas , for example , in lemmas [ lemma3 ] , [ lemma4 ] , [ lemma8 ] , [ lemma9 ] , [ lemma11 ] , [ lemma12 ] .",
    "lemmas [ lemma3 ] , [ lemma4 ] , [ lemma11 ] , [ lemma12 ] may be useful in many other problems .    in @xcite a stationary equation @xmath4 with a nonlinear monotone operator @xmath1 was studied .",
    "the assumptions a1-a3 on p.197 in @xcite are more restrictive than ours , and the rule r2 on p.199 , formula ( 4.1 ) in @xcite for the choice of the regularization parameter is quite different from our rule and is more difficult to use it computationally : one has to solve a nonlinear equation ( equation ( 4.1 ) in @xcite ) in order to find the regularization parameter . to use this equation",
    "one has to invert an ill - conditioned linear operator @xmath5 for small values of @xmath6 .",
    "assumption a1 in @xcite is not verifiable practically , because the solution @xmath7 is not known .",
    "assumption a3 in @xcite requires @xmath1 to be constant in a ball @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "our method does not require these assumptions , and , in contrast to equation ( 4.1 ) in @xcite , it does not require inversion of ill - conditioned linear operators and solving nonlinear equations for finding the regularization parameter . the stopping time is chosen numerically in our method without extra computational effort by a discrepancy - type principle formulated and justified in theorem [ mainthm ] , in section [ mainsec ] .",
    "we give a convergent iterative process for stable solution of equation ( 1.1 ) and a stopping rule for this process .    in @xcite",
    "the `` source - type assumption '' is made , that is , it is assumed that the right - hand side of the equation @xmath4 belongs to the range of a suitable operator .",
    "this usually allows one to get some convergence rate . in our paper ,",
    "as was already mentioned above , such an assumption is not used because , on the one hand , numerically it is difficult to verify such an assumption , and , on the other hand , such an assumption may be not satisfied in many cases , even in linear ill - posed problems , for example , in the case when the solution does not have extra smoothness .",
    "we assume the nonlinearity to be twice locally frchet differentiable .",
    "this assumption , as we mention below , does not restrict the global growth of the nonlinearity . in many practical and theoretical problems",
    "the nonlinearities are smooth and given analytically .",
    "in these cases one can calculate @xmath10 analytically .",
    "this is the case in the example , considered in section [ numsec ] .",
    "this example is a simple model problem for non - linear wiener - type filtering ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if one drops the nonlinear cubic term in the equation @xmath11 of this example , then the resulting equation @xmath12 does not have integrable solutions , in general , even for very smooth @xmath13 , for example , for @xmath14)$ ] , as shown in @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of special interest to solve this equation numerically .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that the set @xmath15 is closed and convex if @xmath1 is monotone and continuous . a closed and convex set in a hilbert space",
    "has a unique minimal - norm element .",
    "this element in @xmath16 we denote by @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an element of @xmath2 , @xmath21 is arbitrary , and @xmath22 is not known but @xmath23 , the noisy data , are known , and @xmath24 .",
    "assumption simplifies our arguments and does not restrict the global growth of the nonlinearity . in @xcite",
    "this assumption is weakened to hemicontinuity in the problems related to the existence of the global solutions of the equations , generated by the dsm . in many applications",
    "the nonlinearity @xmath1 is given analytically , and then one can calculate @xmath25 analytically .    if @xmath25 is not boundedly invertible then solving equation for @xmath26 given noisy data @xmath23 is often ( but not always ) an ill - posed problem . when @xmath1 is a linear bounded operator many methods for stable solving of were proposed ( see @xcite , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is nonlinear then the theory is less complete .",
    "dsm consists of finding a nonlinear map @xmath27 such that the cauchy problem @xmath28 has a unique solution for all @xmath29 , there exists @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 various choices of @xmath33 were proposed in @xcite for to hold .",
    "each such choice yields a version of the dsm .",
    "the dsm for solving equation was extensively studied in @xcite@xcite . in @xcite , the following version of the dsm",
    "was investigated for monotone operators @xmath1 : @xmath34 here @xmath35 denotes the identity operator in @xmath2 .",
    "the convergence of this method was justified with some _ a priori _ choice of stopping rule .    in @xcite a continuous gradient method for solving equation",
    "was studied .",
    "a stopping rule of discrepancy type was introduced and justified under the assumption that @xmath1 satisfies the following condition : @xmath36 for all @xmath37 in some ball @xmath38 .",
    "this very restrictive assumption is not satisfied even for monotone operators . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 for some @xmath40 then implies @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , provided that @xmath43 contains a solution of . in this paper",
    "we consider a gradient - type version of the dsm for solving equation : @xmath44 where @xmath1 is a monotone operator and @xmath45 denotes the adjoint to a linear operator @xmath46 . if @xmath1 is monotone then @xmath47 . if a bounded linear operator @xmath46 is defined on all of the complex hilbert space @xmath2 and @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , then @xmath50 , so @xmath46 is selfadjoint . in a real hilbert space @xmath2 a bounded linear operator defined on all of @xmath2 and",

    "the convergence of the method for any initial value @xmath55 is proved for a stopping rule based on a discrepancy principle .",
    "this _ a posteriori _ choice of stopping time @xmath56 is justified provided that @xmath57 is suitably chosen .",
    "the advantage of method , a modified version of the gradient method , over the gauss - newton method and the version of the dsm is the following : no inversion of matrices is needed in .",
    "although the convergence rate of the dsm maybe slower than that of the dsm , the dsm might be faster than the dsm for large - scale systems due to its lower computation cost at each iteration .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a stopping rule based on a discrepancy principle ( dp ) for the dsm .",
    "the main results of this paper are theorem  [ mainthm ] and theorem  [ mainthm2 ] in which a dp is formulated , the existence of a stopping time @xmath56 is proved , and the convergence of the dsm with the proposed dp is justified under some natural assumptions .",
