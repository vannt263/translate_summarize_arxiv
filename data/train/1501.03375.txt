    "in 1984 , shuichi nos@xmath0 constructed a system called nos@xmath0 equations to model the interaction of a particle with a heat - bath [ 1,2 ] . in 1986 ,",
    "posch , hoover and vesely simplified the nos@xmath0 equations by omitting an inessential variable and replaced the residual `` momentum '' by a `` friction coefficient '' and then got the following nos@xmath0-hoover equations [ 3 ] : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a positive real parameter .",
    "system ( 1 ) does not possess any fixed points and yet some interesting dynamics behaviors have been shown in [ 3 ] .",
    "for example , for some large value of parameter @xmath2 , the system exhibits both tori and chaotic trajectories , depending on initial conditions .",
    "+ recently , sprott et al . considered generalized nos@xmath0-hoover oscillators ( the corresponding harmonic equations are @xmath3 ) [ 4 ] .",
    "they showed many interesting and surprising dynamic behaviors as follows .",
    "for some values of @xmath4 , they got that the conservative regions can coexist with dissipative regions in phase space by constructing appropriate cross - section .",
    "especially , they showed that the systems owns interlinked invariant tori ( see fig 2 in [ 4 ] ) .",
    "also , sprott have found an other system without equilibrium that has a strange attractor and invariant tori [ 5 ] .",
    "however , it seems that the system studied in [ 5 ] does not possesses interlinked invariant tori .",
    "+ in this paper , we revisit the original nos@xmath0-hoover system ( 1 ) with parameter @xmath5 . by using proper cross - section ,",
    "we show more types of invariant tori than those shown in [ 3 ] , such as the invariant tori of trefoil knot type , the invariant tori with different types of symmetry , etc .",
    "moreover , we show that the original system ( 1 ) possesses more complicated interlinked invariant tori than the generalized nos@xmath0-hoover oscillators shown in [ 4 ] in terms of interlinking numbers ( see the following section 3 for definition ) .",
    "throughout the rest of this paper , we fix @xmath5 .",
    "when taking some initial conditions , the corresponding regular trajectories can trace out invariant tori in phase space .",
    "for example , for this initial condition @xmath6 , an invariant torus is produced and its lyapunov exponents are ( 0,0,0)(see figure 1(a ) and figure 2 ) .",
    "in addition , chaotic trajectories can be found for some other initial conditions .",
    "for example , when taking the initial condition @xmath7 , a chaotic trajectory with the lyapunov exponents ( 0.0403 -0.0009 -0.0395 ) is produced ( see figure 1(b ) and figure 2 ) .",
    "numerical calculation shows that the chaotic trajectory is a so - called attractor .",
    "since the system ( 1 ) has no equilibrium points , the attractor is `` hidden '' in the sense of leonov and kuznetsov [ 6 - 8 ] , meaning that its basin does not intersect with small neighborhoods of any equilibrium , and it is can not be found by standard computational methods .",
    "+ from figure 1(c ) and figure 2 , it can be seen that the invariant torus and the chaotic attractor are coexisting in phase space , which indicates the complexity of invariant sets of system ( 1 ) .        in order to demonstrate more clearly the complicated global structure of invariant sets of the system , we construct a cross - section @xmath8 as shown in figure 2 and study the poincar@xmath0 map @xmath9 defined in the plane .",
    "figure 2 shows that the six disjoint subsets @xmath10 contained in @xmath11 are filled with an infinite sequence of nested loops , where @xmath12 is the union of two yellow regions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the union of two violet regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    ", each loop is traced out by regular solution with different initial conditions .",
    "moreover , we find that , for every initial condition in @xmath18 , the corresponding trajectory can generate a unique loop in @xmath19 under the iterated poincar@xmath0 map .",
    "this seems to imply that those tori corresponding to the loops from @xmath18 are of trivial knot type .",
    "the torus shown in figure 1(a ) above is just an example of trivial knot type and its initial condition is in @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , for each initial condition in @xmath19 @xmath21 , the corresponding trajectory can generate two disjoint loops , one of which is in @xmath22 and the other is in @xmath23 .",
    "this should indicate that the tori corresponding to the loops from @xmath12 and @xmath15 are of unusual knot type .",
    "for example , the following figure 3 shows two invariant tori of trefoil knot type and their initial conditions are in @xmath12 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we note that not all regular trajectories can fill full of the surface of a torus .",
    "this is due to a well known result in theory of dynamical systems [ 9 ] , i.e. , for the orientation - preserving rotating map of circle , if the rotation number is rational , each orbit is periodic and can not fill full of the circle ; otherwise , each orbit can almost fill full of the circle if the rotation number is irrational .",
    "thus , for the system ( 1 ) , considering the poincar@xmath0 map @xmath9 restricted to one of the loops in @xmath11 , if the rotation number of this map is a rational number , one regular trajectory produces a finite string dots in the loop , which implies that we must choose several appropriate initial conditions to produce the closed loop in the cross - section .",
    "in contrast , one regular trajectory produces a dense set of dots in the loop if the rotation number is irrational .",
    "+     + as we all know , a fixed point of poincar@xmath0 map corresponds to a periodic orbit of system ( 1 ) .",
    "since the first return poincar@xmath0 map @xmath9 is a continuous mapping from @xmath19 to @xmath19(@xmath24 ) , there exists at least a fixed point in @xmath19 ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath9 by brouwer fixed point theorem . nevertheless , for @xmath25 , @xmath9 maps @xmath22 to @xmath23 and @xmath23 to @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the second return poincar@xmath0 map @xmath26 map @xmath22 to @xmath22(@xmath25 ) , which shows that there exists at least a fixed point in @xmath22(@xmath25 ) for @xmath26 by brouwer fixed point theorem . from the discussing above ,",
    "we conclude that the system ( 1 ) has at least six periodic orbits . in figure 2 ,",
    "the six small red dots in regions @xmath27 and @xmath16 indicate six different periodic orbits of system ( 1 ) respectively and two of them are shown in figure 4 above as examples .",
    "+ numerical calculation shows that , if randomly taking @xmath28 , we obtain all @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath31 for @xmath30 ( @xmath25)(see appendix for the matlab code ) .",
    "this certifies that , for any @xmath32 , the phase space domain @xmath33 which is filled with an infinite sequence of nested tori should obey time - averaged version of the liouville s theorem [ 4 ] .",
    "here , @xmath34 is a flow generated by system ( 1 ) .",
    "thus we treat @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) as averagely conservative regions .",
    "+ obviously , system ( 1 ) is invariant under the transformation of coordinates @xmath37 , which indicates that , for any invariant torus of system ( 1 ) , the torus generated by a 180@xmath38 rotation of this invariant tori about @xmath39-axis is still an invariant torus of the system .",
    "numerical simulation shows that , for system ( 1 ) , there exists two types of symmetry of tori about @xmath39-axis .",
    "the first type is these tori contained in @xmath35@xmath40 , any of which itself is symmetrical about @xmath39-axis , such as the torus shown in figure 5(a ) above .",
    "the second type is these tori contained in @xmath41 , any of which will be transformed into another invariant torus contained in @xmath42 under the symmetry transformation about @xmath39-axis and vice versa , such as the two tori shown in figure 5(b ) .",
    "+ in addition , since @xmath43 , all of the tori in @xmath35 must go though plane \\{@xmath44 } ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "as shown in subsection 2.1 , for any @xmath45 , the tori which stem from @xmath19 form an infinite nested sequence .",
    "however , the interrelated locations of tori derived from different averagely conservative regions are still not clear so far .",
    "now , by computer simulation , we show the interesting and magnificent interlocked phase - space structures in figure 6 . here , the six tori shown in figure 6 are produced by utilizing the six initial conditions ( -2.48,0,0 ) , ( -1.97,0,0 ) , ( -1.40,0,0 ) , ( -0.72,0,0 ) , ( -1.61,0,0 ) and ( -1,0,-6 ) which belong to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath20 , @xmath48 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 respectively , and all their lyapunov exponents are ( 0,0,0 ) .    from figure 6",
    ", it can be seen that the interlinks of tori exhibit many different types . following [ 10 ]",
    ", we can define _ interlinking number _ to measure the complexity for a interlink of two tori @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath51 .",
    "it can be defined in various ways [ 11,12 ] , all of which turn out to be equivalent . here",
    ", we adopt the easy way used in [ 10,13 ] to clarify the idea which is to count up as follows the crossings of @xmath49 and @xmath50 in a regular projection of the link ( a drawing of it such that no more than two lines cross at any points ) .",
    "assign orientations and then put an arrow to the two projections of the two tori .",
    "define a number @xmath52 for right or left-handed crossing @xmath53 ( see figure 7(a)).then define the interlinking number as    @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 .",
    "figure7(b)[10 ] shows two examples for the definition of interlinking number .     of the interlinks shown in figure 6 @xmath56.,height=113 ]",
    "now , we calculate all the interlinking numbers of the interlinks of tori shown in figure 6 .",
    "we first stress an obvious fact , namely , for any torus @xmath57 from @xmath19 and any torus @xmath58 from @xmath59@xmath60 , @xmath61 is equivalent . for simplicity , we denote all the same values @xmath61 by @xmath62 . according to the above definition of interlinking number , we obtain all thirty values of @xmath63 shown in the following table 9 by choosing applicable projection plane for every different interlinks .",
    "two examples are shown in figure 8(a ) and ( b ) above for the illustrations of the calculations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 and both of their projection planes are @xmath66-plane .",
    "this article has investigated the nos@xmath0-hoover system and reveals that the co - existence of infinite nested tori , a variety of interlinked invariant tori and a chaotic attractor .",
    "furthermore , we have provided a mathematical quantitative description for different interlinks of tori from six different averagely conservative regions by introducing the concept of interlinking number .",
    "it is surprising that the quadratic system which seems so simple possesses so abundantly complicated dynamic properties .",
    "+ it is worth noting that the system ( 1 ) , the generalized nos@xmath0-hoover oscillators studied in [ 4 ] and the unusual system studied in [ 5 ] are all three - dimensional quadratic systems and have no equilibrium points .",
    "meanwhile , all of them possess invariant tori and chaotic attractors .",
    "a natural research topic is when the general quadratic systems without equilibrium points possess the co - existence of invariant tori and chaotic behavior , and moreover possess the interlinked invariant tori .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that the interlinking numbers shown in table 8 will be persisted under small perturbation of parameter @xmath2 provided that there are no bifurcations involvement .",
    "the bifurcation of invariant tori should be another topic to study .",
