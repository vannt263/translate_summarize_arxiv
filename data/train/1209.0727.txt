    "this presentation is based on the paper [ ] .",
    "our goal is to use the saturation / color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism ( see [ ] for reviews ) to calculate the single transverse spin asymmetry ( stsa ) in polarized proton  proton and polarized proton  nucleus collisions . the observable is defined by @xmath4 where the arrow indicates spin - up and spin - down outgoing hadron with the spin direction taken here to be along the @xmath5-axis ( with @xmath6 the collision axis ) .    for simplicity we will consider scattering of a transversely polarized quark on an unpolarized proton or nuclear target @xmath7 .",
    "the realistic case of the incoming transversely polarized proton can be recovered if one convolutes the cross section we obtain with the polarized proton wave function squared , or , perhaps equivalently , with the proton transversity distribution .",
    "figure  [ recoil ] demonstrates that to capture the spin - dependent effects , such as the stsa , one has to go beyond the eikonal accuracy in the calculation .",
    "recoilless eikonal scattering , as shown in the left panel of , is spin - independent and can not generate the asymmetry .",
    "naive inclusion of sub - eikonal corrections is possible by introducing recoil in the scattering , as shown in the right panel of : such diagrams are suppressed by a power of the center of mass energy squared @xmath8 of the collision and are usually discarded in the saturation / cgc formalism since they are very small .",
    "a much larger contribution to stsa may arise from the non - eikonal splitting of the projectile quark into a quark and a gluon , @xmath9 , which is suppressed only by a power of the strong coupling @xmath10 . in the lcpt language",
    "the @xmath1 splitting may take place either long before or long after the interaction with the target , as shown in below .",
    "( splitting during the interaction with the target is suppressed by powers of energy [ ] . )",
    "both such contributions would be included in the light - cone wave function squared of the projectile ( quark ) .",
    "the spin - dependence by itself is insufficient to generate the stsa : one also needs a relative phase between the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude contributing to the stsa - generating part of the process [ ] . in the standard interpretation of the sivers effect [ ] both the spin - dependence and the relative phase originate in the wave function squared ( though , often - times , the actual diagrammatic representation of the effect requires a final - state interaction with the polarized projectile [ ] , which , in the cgc rapidity - ordered language , can still be incorporated as a final - state light - cone wave function [ ] ) .",
    "the lowest - order @xmath9 splitting from is too basic to generate the phase . in the collins mechanism",
    "the phase is generated in the fragmentation function [ ] : this can certainly take place in the saturation / cgc framework as well , but is not the main aim of this investigation .",
    "below we show that it is also possible to generate the relative phase in the integration with the unpolarized target .",
    "we thus obtain a new mechanism for generating stsa , where the spin dependence comes from the polarized projectile wave function , while the phase arises in the interaction with the target .",
    "the diagrams for the scattering process of a transversely polarized quark on a proton or nuclear target are shown in .",
    "squaring the sum of these diagrams gives us the graphs shown in which contribute to the inclusive quark production cross section .",
    "the calculation proceeds along the standard steps employing the light - cone perturbation theory ( lcpt ) ( see [ ] for a review ) : the @xmath1 splitting contributes to the light - cone wave function , which factorizes from the interaction with the target .",
    "the general result for the quark production in the @xmath11 scattering given by diagrams in reads @xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the light - cone wave function squared and @xmath14 representing the interaction with the target with all the coordinate labels shown explicitly in . here",
    "[ eq - kinematic constraints ] @xmath15    are the transverse coordinates of the incoming quark in the amplitude and in the complex conjugate amplitude , while @xmath16 is the fraction of the incoming quark s plus momentum component @xmath17 carried by the produced quark with the plus momentum component @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 .",
    "the light - cone wave function squared @xmath13 can be decomposed into a polarization - independent term and another term which is proportional to the quark transverse polarization eigenvalue @xmath20 , @xmath21 where a straightforward calculation yields [ ] @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the unpolarized component and @xmath23 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the polarization - dependent part . here @xmath24 with @xmath25 the quark mass .    to describe the interaction with the target in we use the wilson line formalism in the @xmath26 light cone gauge of the projectile ( see [ ] for a detailed description of the formalism ) .",
    "( our light cone 4-vector components are defined by @xmath27 . ) defining the fundamental representation wilson line @xmath28\\ ] ] we can write the @xmath29-matrix operator for a fundamental - representation color dipole scattering on the target proton or nucleus by @xmath30.\\ ] ] using this object we can write the interaction with the target @xmath14 as @xmath31 where the first two terms are given by the graphs in the first line of .    our goal is to find whether the quark production cross section contributes to the stsa defined in .",
    "clearly stsa should be given by the part of the cross section odd under the @xmath32 interchange .",
    "stsa is usually thought of as arising from the @xmath33 term in the cross section , where @xmath34 is the spin of the incoming projectile and @xmath35 is its momentum : such term is @xmath0-odd .",
    "analyzing we see that the @xmath32 transformation can be thought of as the @xmath36 coordinate interchange .",
    "the @xmath0-odd stsa - generating part results from the part of the integrand in which is odd under the @xmath37 interchange : since the integrand is a product of @xmath13 and @xmath14 the @xmath0-odd contribution may arise in either of these terms . because our lowest - order @xmath13 is symmetric under @xmath36 , at this level of approximation",
    "the stsa can only arise in the interaction with the target @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we need to decompose into the @xmath36 symmetric and anti - symmetric parts , with the latter one giving rise to stsa when used in .    before we proceed to anti - symmetrize @xmath14 ,",
    "let us pause and point out that the decomposition into the light cone wave function squared and the interaction with the target is quite general and is valid up to corrections suppressed by powers of energy , which are usually neglected in the high energy qcd framework . the conclusion that the @xmath0-odd stsa - generating term may arise either in the wave function squared or in the interaction with the target is also quite general .",
    "an example of the wave function squared giving the stsa - generating contribution is the initial - state sivers effect [ ] , though , as was illustrated in [ ] , and as is also seen in , the wave function squared also includes final state splittings and interactions . below we will construct the first ever example of the @xmath0-odd stsa - generating term generated in the interaction with the target .    to anti - symmetrize @xmath14 under the @xmath38 interchange we first need to decompose each dipole @xmath29-matrix into the even and odd pieces under the exchange of its transverse coordinates , which corresponds to the @xmath39-parity operation exchanging the quark and the anti - quark [ ] :    [ eq - pomeron and odderon ] @xmath40    the @xmath39- and @xmath0-even part @xmath41 is the `` standard '' dipole amplitude giving the total unpolarized dis cross section in dis .",
    "its expression in terms of wilson lines allows to include glauber - mueller multiple rescatterings [ ] along with the nonlinear small-@xmath42 bk / jimwlk evolution in the leading-@xmath43 approximation .",
    "the @xmath39- and @xmath0-odd _ odderon _ amplitude @xmath44 [ ] starts out with the triple gluon exchange at the lowest order [ ] , but then can also be enhanced by the multiple rescatterings and small-@xmath42 evolution [ ] .    using the decomposition we can split @xmath14 into the @xmath0- and @xmath39-even @xmath37 symmetric part and the @xmath0- and @xmath39-odd @xmath37 anti - symmetric part :    [ eq - symmetrized interaction ] @xmath45    the spin - dependent and spin - averaged cross sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 for quark production from read    [ eq - observables ] @xmath48    where the wave functions squared are given by eqs . , , and the interactions are given by eqs .  .",
    "are the main results of this work : when substituted into they give the single - transverse spin asymmetry @xmath49 generated in quark production by the @xmath39- and @xmath0-odd interactions with the target .",
    "the expressions in eqs .",
    "are hard to evaluate in general .",
    "to understand the main properties of the stsa contribution resulting from our mechanism , we used the amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 evaluated in the glauber - mueller [ ] multiple - rescattering approximation and determined the corresponding stsa in the large-@xmath52 limit after making several crude approximations described in [ ] .",
    "the results are summarized below .",
    "first of all , in the large-@xmath3 limit the stsa due to our mechanism is ( assuming that the unpolarized cross section @xmath47 is dominated by gluon production ) @xmath53 which is a steeply - falling function of @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that in the standard factorization framework our stsa generating mechanism originates in some higher - twist operator .     +    the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath49 is illustrated over a broader momentum range in .",
    "note that the asymmetry is a non - monotonic function of @xmath3 which even changes sign ( it has zeros / nodes ) .",
    "this seems to be in qualitative agreement with some of the experimental data on stsa .",
    "the maximum of @xmath49 in the saturation framework is correlated with the saturation scale .",
    "another important feature is that the asymmetry in increases with the increasing momentum fraction @xmath16 ( an analogue of the feynman-@xmath42 variable ) for most values of @xmath16 : this is also in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "an important feature of our stsa is that it is proportional to @xmath54 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath55 the nuclear profile function .",
    "since the variation of @xmath55 is largest in the peripheral collisions , our stsa seems to be dominated by large impact parameter scattering and is sensitive to the edges of the target .",
    "this explains the difference between the two panels in , which are different in the infrared cutoff used to limit the large-@xmath56 integration . a full analysis of the obtained formula without crude approximations made in [ ]",
    "should determine whether the saturation scale is large enough in the peripheral collisions dominating stsa for the perturbative approach to be valid .",
    "the dependence of our stsa on the size of the target for @xmath57 is @xmath58 if @xmath59 .",
    "this is a very steep falloff of stsa with the atomic number of the nuclear target , which is also illustrated in , where @xmath49 is plotted for several target radii .",
    "we thus predict that , in our formalism , stsa should be much smaller in the polarized proton ",
    "nucleus collisions than in the polarized proton  proton collisions .",
    "the mechanism we employed allows one to calculate the stsa of prompt photons as well .",
    "the calculation yields [ ] @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is given by with the @xmath62 replacement .",
    "this expression is zero since @xmath63 due to the fact that the odderon amplitude is an anti - symmetric function of its transverse coordinate arguments , @xmath64    we thus have an exact result that in our mechanism the photon stsa is zero , @xmath65 at least in the order of approximation considered here .",
    "in the future it will be important to explore other ways of generating stsa in the saturation / cgc formalism .",
    "above we studied stsa originating in the interaction with the unpolarized target .",
    "however , as we mentioned , it may also originate in the wave function squared .",
    "this would be the sivers mechanism as studied in [ ] .",
    "the analogue of this effect is illustrated in , where the stsa should be obtained by the interference between the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ sivers ] and [ qtoqgampl ] .",
    "the relative phase would arise due to the extra rescattering with the polarized projectile , and is depicted by the cut giving the imaginary part .",
    "( indeed shows only one of the relevant diagrams . )",
