    "in wollack et al . ( 1993 ) , we reported on a measurement of the anisotropy in the cmb made from saskatoon , sk ( sk93 ) .",
    "the results were most parsimoniously described as a detection of cmb anisotropy .",
    "however , an anisotropy in galactic free - free emission could have produced similar data with @xmath5% probability .",
    "we have since returned to saskatoon and observed the same fields with an an extended frequency baseline that now spans 26 to 46 ghz .",
    "the new data , sk94 , confirm the 1993 results and strongly constrain the spectral index of the fluctuations . reviews of the state of cmb anisotropy measurements are given in bond ( 1994 ) , readhead & lawrence ( 1992 ) , and white et al .",
    "observations were made with two independent radiometers , one in @xmath6 band and one in @xmath7 band , that sequentially shared the same telescope .",
    "the details of the instrument may be found in wollack ( 1994a , 1994b ) , wollack et al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter w1 ) and page et al .",
    "each radiometer detects the total power in three frequency bands and two polarizations radiometer ; it is not used . ] .",
    "the radiation is amplified by hemts ( pospieszalski et al .",
    "1988 ; pospieszalski 1992 ) cooled to 15k .",
    "the passbands for @xmath6 band are 26 - 29 , 29 - 32 , 32 - 36 ghz , and for @xmath7 band are 36 - 39.5 , 39.5 - 43 , 43 - 46 ghz .",
    "the six channels in each radiometer view the sky in a single approximately frequency - independent beam formed by a cold corrugated horn feeding an ambient temperature off - axis parabola .",
    "the fwhm beam in @xmath6 band is @xmath8 and in @xmath7 band is @xmath9 .",
    "after the parabola , the beam reflects off of a 90 @xmath10 150 cm chopping flat that scans the beam back and forth about a vertical axis , following an approximately triangular waveform at 3.90625 hz .",
    "a large stationary ground screen shields the radiometer from terrestrial and solar emission .",
    "other than the new radiometer and the modulation scheme described below , the principle improvements to the instrument described in w1 are 1 ) an enlarged ground screen ; in our data , contaminating signals from the ground and sun are less than @xmath11k .",
    "2 ) thermal stabilization of all radiometer components to better than 0.1 k ; and 3 ) increased vibrational isolation of the radiometers .",
    "the chopping flat sweeps the beam in azimuth while the radiometer channels are synchronously sampled at 250 hz .",
    "the the angle between the sweep endpoints subtends @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the @xmath6 and @xmath14 systems respectively ; thus , the @xmath15db antenna beam contours of the two systems match at the extrema of their sweeps .",
    "the center of the sweep pattern is wobbled every 20 seconds from @xmath16 west of the north celestial pole to @xmath16 east .",
    "the effective beam pattern is synthesized in software by appropriately weighting each sample during a chopper sweep .",
    "this allows us to probe multiple angular scales , optimize the spatial frequency coverage to mitigate atmospheric contamination , examine the quadrature demodulation , and match the @xmath6 and @xmath14 synthesized profiles even though the fwhms are different . the full analysis based on this scheme",
    "will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ; here , we use the method to synthesize the sk93 pattern .",
    "the beam pattern for one chopper sweep is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data are normalized so that a @xmath11k temperature change in the positive lobe of a beam averaged over @xmath17 in right ascension ( 1 bin ) gives a signal of @xmath11k . a good approximation to the window function",
    "is @xmath18)+.5p_l(cos[2\\theta_t])]e^{l(l+1)\\sigma^2}$ ] where @xmath19 are the legendre polynomials , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the instrument is calibrated using cassiopeia - a . from a fit of the 8 - 250 ghz data in baars ( 1979 ) and metzger ( 1986 ) , we find @xmath22 jy , ( @xmath23 in ghz , epoch 1994 ) corresponding to a @xmath24mk signal with a @xmath25 beam at 38.3 ghz .",
    "the laboratory calibrations agree with this to within 20% . because cas - a is observed in the same thermal and radiometric environment in which the cmb is observed , we consider it the definitive calibration .",
    "cas - a is also used to map the beam ; the values are within @xmath26 of those found with a microwave source .",
    "the absolute pointing error , as determined from cas - a , is @xmath27 .",
    "in essence , the data reduction consists of editing as described below , binning the results on the sky , and subtracting the mean of the binned data .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "although the constant part of the demodulated signal , or offset , depends on the east / west position and on the frequency and polarization , it is relatively independent of time .",
    "a typical drift is @xmath28k / day in both radiometers .",
    "variations in the chopping flat temperature will effect the offset because of the dependence of the emissivity on the incident angle .",
    "the offset is fitted to the temperature of the chopper and a correlation is found ; however , removing the small variation has a negligible effect on the final data set .",
    "there are three components to the data editing procedure .",
    "1 ) the data from the single - difference demodulation , which is sensitive to horizontal spatial gradients in the sky , are used to monitor the atmosphere .",
    "if the mean deviation of 8s averages of data is greater than some value , @xmath29 , then the 15 minute section containing those data is cut . in table 1 , we have converted @xmath29 into the standard deviation of the variation in the horizontal thermal gradient of the atmosphere , @xmath30 .",
    "this value is relatively independent of the observing strategy .",
    "in addition , for a 15 minute section to be included , both abutting 15 minute sections must also be good .",
    "2 ) next , the standard deviation of the 64 datum from each chopper cycle is computed .",
    "if one or more points deviates by 3.5@xmath31 , then the entire chopper cycle is deleted .",
    "this cuts an additional 2.6% of the good data .",
    "3 ) finally , we require that no 20s average of data in a right - ascension bin deviate by more than @xmath32 of all the data in the bin .",
    "this cut rejects @xmath33% of the data that passed the atmosphere cut and the final results are robust to variations in this cut level .",
    "the data quality is monitored with a quadrature demodulation ( data taken during the clockwise chopper scan minus data taken during the counterclockwise scan ) .",
    "this signal is consistent with zero .    to quantify the anisotropy signal",
    ", we use the bayesian method described in w1 to find the root - mean - squared amplitude , @xmath34 and index , @xmath35 , of the fluctuations . in the full implementation",
    ", the new data are analyzed along with the sk93 data using a @xmath36 correlation matrix .",
    "a maximum of the likelihood , @xmath37 , is found when @xmath34 and @xmath35 scale the fixed spatial correlations inherent in the observing pattern so that they best describe the patterns in the measured data .",
    "the data taken in the east and west are treated independently and the atmosphere and hemt induced correlations are accounted for ( dodelson & kosowsky 1994a ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath34 depends on the observing strategy .",
    "we convert it into an estimate of square root of the angular power spectrum in a band of multipoles between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) following bond ( 1994 ) and peebles ( 1994 ) .",
    "the results are given in table 1 .",
    "table 1 shows that there is a strong detection of anisotropy with @xmath41 , independent of atmosphere cut and data sub - set .",
    "if the @xmath42 data are subtracted from the @xmath43 data , the result is consistent with zero , as expected if both see the same signal .",
    "in other words , the @xmath44 results confirm the @xmath42 results .",
    "there are two dominant sources of systematic error in this measurement ; inaccuracy in our knowledge of the flux from cas - a ( 13% ) and an inaccuracy in our measurement of cas - a ( q :  6% , ka :  3% ) .",
    "small errors are introduced by inaccuracies in the beam fwhm ( 2% ) , in the measurements of the passbands ( @xmath45 ) , and in the phases of the recorded signals with respect to the optical axis ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the combination of all these errors leads to a @xmath47 uncertainty in our temperature scale . for the best estimate of celestial fluctuations we give the result with the most statistical weight ( @xmath48k ) with the @xmath47 added in quadrature , @xmath49k . converting to a band - power . ]",
    ", we find @xmath50k at @xmath40 .    in table 1 , one notes that the addition of new data did not improve the statistical error bar by the square root of the observing time . in part , this is because the error on @xmath34 contains the sample variance , which is a function of the area of the sky observed .",
    "the statistical error bar for the @xmath42 data is @xmath51k ( the expectation value , opposed to the maximum of the likelihood , is roughly half way between the 16% and 84% integrals ) .",
    "if the sample variance , which is computed to be @xmath52k , is subtracted from this in quadrature then one finds an `` intrinsic '' error of @xmath53k .",
    "the full data set should have an intrinsic error of @xmath54k which is close to the computed value of @xmath55k .",
    "in addition , by inspection of figure 2 and table 1 , one sees that the data from the three radiometers may differ by more than one would expect from random noise alone , possibly due to the atmosphere .",
    "this would tend broaden @xmath37 .",
    "there are two sources of a systematic error on @xmath35 , uncertainty in the relative calibration between channels and the uncertainty in the fit to the cas - a calibration data .",
    "these combine to produce an error of @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , we can not be certain that atmospheric fluctuations are not biasing our answer . while the bottom two entries in table 1 agree statistically , one might worry that low cut levels result in more negative indices . to ensure that the quoted value for @xmath35 represents one s confidence , we quote the average value of @xmath35 with an error bar that nearly encompasses the errors from both entries . including the systematic uncertainty , @xmath57 .    to investigate the possibility that @xmath34 is due to a galactic foreground , we examine @xmath37 bearing in mind that there might be an atmospheric bias .",
    "@xmath37 is normalized to 1 at its maximum . for free - free emission , @xmath58= 2\\times10^{-6}$ ] and",
    "@xmath59 for the bottom two entries in table 1 respectively . for interstellar dust emission , @xmath60 = 4\\times10^{-3}$ ] and @xmath61 for the same two entries .",
    "clearly these possibilities are strongly ruled out , in the worst case at @xmath3 ( @xmath62 for a normal distribution ) . in w1 , @xmath34 from extra - galactic sources",
    "is expected to be @xmath63k .",
    "a conservative index for these sources is @xmath64 ; thus , this explanation too is disfavored .",
    "an anisotropy in the cmb , @xmath65 , is the most compelling interpretation of the data .    in the analysis , we assume that only one celestial component produces the anisotropy .",
    "dodelson & kosowsky ( 1994b ) have performed a more general analysis on the sk93 data that allows two fluctuating components , cmb and free - free .",
    "the result was a decrease in the significance of the detection of cmb . with this new limit on @xmath35 , @xmath34 of uncorrelated free - free emission@xmath66 .",
    "then , @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68k and @xmath69 , @xmath70k , and @xmath71k , near the bottom of our confidence range .",
    "] is less than @xmath72k , an additional constraint on two component models . using these data alone",
    ", we can not rule out a model which assumes co - located interstellar dust and free - free emission , but , based on firs ( ganga 1994 ) we expect dust to contribute less than @xmath11k , again , added in quadrature .",
    "gaussian correlation functions are often used to compare measurements .",
    "we find @xmath73 for a correlation angle @xmath74 . alternatively",
    ", the result may be interpreted in the context of the ` standard ' cdm model ( steinhardt 1993 ; bond et al .",
    "1994 ) , ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , no reionization ) , for which we find that the root - mean - squared quadrupole has a value @xmath78k .",
