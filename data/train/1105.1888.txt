    "many inequalities involving such functions can be derived ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant application of this approach concerns the localization of ordered sequences of real numbers as they occur in the problem of finding estimates of eigenvalues of a matrix ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
