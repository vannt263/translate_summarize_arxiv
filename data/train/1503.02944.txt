    "neutron - deficient isotopes in the lead region are nowadays well established examples of the shape coexistence phenomenon in nuclei @xcite .",
    "they have been subject of much experimental and theoretical interest in the last years .",
    "the first direct evidence of the shape coexistence in the region @xmath2 was obtained in neutron - deficient hg isotopes from isotope shift measurements @xcite .",
    "those measurements showed a sharp transition in the nuclear size between the ground states of @xmath3hg and @xmath4hg that was interpreted @xcite as a change from a weak oblate shape in the heavier isotopes to a more deformed prolate shape in the lighter ones from calculations based on strutinsky s shell correction method .",
    "later , new isotope shift measurements @xcite revealed a weakly oblate deformed character of the ground states of the even - mass hg isotopes down to @xmath5 , with an odd - even staggering persisting down to @xmath6hg .",
    "the radius of the oblate isomeric state in @xmath4hg follows the trend of the even - even ground - state radii .",
    "shape evolution and shape coexistence in the region of @xmath0-unstable nuclei with @xmath2 were subsequently studied experimentally by @xmath7-ray spectroscopy in the @xmath8-decay of the products created in fusion - evaporation reactions ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "maybe , the most singular case corresponds to @xmath9pb , where two excited @xmath10 states below 700 kev @xcite have been found .",
    "furthermore , low - lying excited @xmath10 states have been experimentally observed at excitation energies below 1 mev @xcite in all even pb isotopes between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 excited states below 1 mev have been found in neutron - deficient hg isotopes from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of the hg isotopes @xcite shows a nearly constant behavior of the energy of the yrast states in the range @xmath16 , which are interpreted as members of a rotational band on top of a weakly deformed oblate ground state . for lighter isotopes ,",
    "@xmath13 excited states appear at low energies , decreasing in excitation energy up to @xmath5 .",
    "they are interpreted as the band - heads of prolate configurations .",
    "their excited states become yrast above @xmath17 for @xmath18 , whereas the @xmath19 levels become close enough in energy to the weakly deformed states , opening the possibility of mixing strongly with them . nevertheless , to determine the magnitude and type of deformation of the bands and their mixing , spectroscopy studies are not enough and the electromagnetic properties ( e2 transition strengths ) of the low - lying states have to be determined . lifetime measurements in neutron - deficient hg isotopes",
    "have been performed in the last years @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite , coulomb - excitation experiments have been performed to study the electromagnetic properties of light hg isotopes @xmath20hg . in these experiments ,",
    "the deformation of the ground state and low - lying excited states were deduced , confirming the presence of two different coexisting structures in the light even - even hg isotopes that are pure at higher spin values and mix at low excitation energy .",
    "the ground states of hg isotopes in the mass range @xmath21 are found to be weakly deformed and of predominantly oblate nature , while the excited @xmath13 states in @xmath22hg exhibit a larger deformation .",
    "similarly , low - lying states in light pt isotopes have been studied experimentally with @xmath7-ray spectroscopy @xcite , showing that shape coexistence of states with different deformation is still present in neutron - deficient pt isotopes with @xmath23 .",
    "moderate odd - even staggering was also found in very light pt isotopes from laser spectroscopy @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "different types of models have been used to explain the coexistence of several @xmath10 states at low energies @xcite . in a shell model picture ,",
    "the excited @xmath10 states are interpreted as multi particle - hole excitations . protons and neutrons outside the inert core interact through pairing and quadrupole interactions to generate deformed structures . within a mean - field description of the nuclear structure ,",
    "the presence of several minima at low energies in the energy surface , corresponding to different @xmath10 states , is understood as due to the coexistence of various collective nuclear shapes . in the mean - field approach",
    ", the energy of the different shape configurations can be evaluated with constrained calculations , minimizing the hartree - fock energy under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "the resulting total energy plots versus deformation are called in what follows deformation - energy curves ( dec ) .",
    "these calculations have become more and more refined with time , resulting in accurate descriptions of the nuclear shapes and the configurations involved .",
    "calculations based on phenomenological mean fields and strutinsky method @xcite , are already able to predict the existence of several competing minima in the deformation - energy surface of neutron - deficient pt , hg , and pb isotopes .",
    "self - consistent mean - field calculations with non - relativistic skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite , as well as relativistic @xcite energy density functionals have been carried out .",
    "inclusion of correlations beyond mean field @xcite are needed to obtain a detailed description of the spectroscopy .",
    "they involve symmetry restoration by means of angular momentum and particle number projection and configuration mixing within a generator coordinate method .",
    "it is shown that the underlying mean field picture of coexisting shapes is in general supported , except in those cases where the deformed mean - field structures appear at close energies . in this case",
    "mixing can be important , affecting b(e2 ) strengths and their corresponding @xmath0 deformation parameters .",
    "the basic picture is also confirmed from recent calculations within the interacting boson model with configuration mixing carried out for hg @xcite and pt @xcite isotopes .",
    "triaxiality in this mass region has also been explored systematically @xcite , showing that although the axial deformations seem to be the basic ingredients , triaxiality may play a role in some cases .",
    "a systematic survey of energy surfaces in the @xmath24 plane with the gogny d1s interaction can be found in the bruyres - le - chtel database @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the decay properties of @xmath0-unstable nuclei may depend on the nuclear shape of the decaying nucleus .",
    "in particular , the gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions corresponding to @xmath25/ec - decay of proton - rich nuclei in the mass region @xmath26 have been studied systematically @xcite as a function of the deformation , using a deformed quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) approach built on a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field with skyrme forces and pairing correlations .",
    "the study has also been extended to stable @xmath27-shell nuclei @xcite and to neutron - rich nuclei in the mass region @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to deformation has been exploited to determine the nuclear shape in neutron - deficient kr and sr isotopes by comparing theoretical results with @xmath0-decay measurements using the total absorption spectroscopy technique ( tas ) @xcite .",
    "similar studies for the decay properties of even - even neutron - deficient pb , po , and hg isotopes were initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite to predict the extent to which gt strength distributions may be used as fingerprints of the nuclear shapes in this mass region .",
    "in those works , it was shown that the existence of shape isomers , as well as the location of their equilibrium deformations , are rather stable and independent on the skyrme and pairing forces .",
    "it was also found that the gt strength distributions calculated at the various equilibrium deformations exhibit specific features that can be used as signatures of the shape isomers and , what is important , these features remain basically unaltered against changes in the skyrme and pairing forces .    in this paper",
    "we extend those calculations by studying the decs and the gt strength distributions of neutron - deficient @xmath29hg and @xmath30pt isotopes , focusing on their dependence on deformation .",
    "in addition , we also include as a novelty the decay properties of the odd-@xmath1 isotopes and discuss the sensitivity of the decay patterns to the spin - parity of the decaying nucleus .",
    "the aim here is to identify possible signatures of the shape of the nucleus in the decay patterns .",
    "this study is timely because the possibility to carry out these measurements in odd-@xmath1 nuclei is being considered at present at isolde / cern @xcite .",
    "a program aiming to measure the gamow - teller strength distributions in neutron - deficient isotopes in the lead region with tas techniques started with @xmath31pb isotopes .",
    "these data have been already analyzed and submitted for publication @xcite .",
    "similar measurements have been carried out in @xmath32hg and are being presently analyzed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the main features of our theoretical framework .",
    "section iii contains our results for the energy deformation curves and gt strength distributions in the neutron - deficient hg and pt isotopes relevant for @xmath25/ec - decay .",
    "we also compare the experimental half - lives with our results and discuss the gt strength distributions and their sums in various ranges of excitation energies .",
    "section iv contains the main conclusions .",
    "in this section we present a summary of the theoretical formalism used in this paper to describe the @xmath0-decay properties in hg and pt neutron - deficient isotopes . more details of the microscopic calculations can be found in refs .",
    "the method starts with a self - consistent calculation based on a deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with effective two - body density - dependent skyrme interactions including pairing correlations in bcs approximation . from these calculations we obtain energies , occupation probabilities and wave functions of the single - particle states .",
    "most of the calculations in this work have been performed with the interaction sly4 @xcite , being among the most successful and extensively studied skyrme force in the last years @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparison with other widely used skyrme forces like the simpler sk3 @xcite and sgii @xcite that has been shown to provide good spin - isospin properties , will be shown in some instances .",
    "the solution of the hf equation is found by using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences through a symmetric five - term formula involving the experimental binding energies @xcite . in those cases where experimental information for masses is still not available , same pairing gaps as the closer isotope",
    "measured are used .",
    "the decs are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath0 from constrained hf calculations .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently at the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions ( in general deformed ) for which minima are obtained in the energy curves .",
    "it is worth mentioning some existing works in this mass region based on mean - field approaches other than the present skyrme hf+bcs calculations . in particular ,",
    "mean - field studies of structural changes with the gogny interaction can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for hg isotopes and in refs .",
    "@xcite for pt isotopes .",
    "the clear advantage of the finite - range gogny force over the contact skyrme force is that pairing correlations can be treated self - consistently using the same interaction through a hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation .",
    "triaxial landscapes were studied in those references , showing that the ( axial ) prolate and oblate minima , which are well separated by high - energy barriers in the @xmath0 degree of freedom , are in many cases softly linked along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "indeed , some axial minima become saddle points when the @xmath7 degree of freedom is included in the analysis .",
    "the differences found with the present hf+bcs approach for the axial equilibrium values are not significant , but the topology of the surfaces are somewhat different .",
    "similarities and differences of the various topologies are discussed in the next section .    in the case of odd-@xmath1 nuclei ,",
    "the ground state is expressed as a one - quasiparticle ( 1qp ) state , which is determined by finding the blocked state that minimizes the total energy . in the present study we use the equal filling approximation ( efa ) , a prescription widely used in mean - field calculations to treat the dynamics of odd nuclei preserving time - reversal invariance @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the unpaired nucleon is treated on equal footing with its time - reversed state by putting half a nucleon in a given orbital and the other half in the time - reversed partner .",
    "this approximation has been found to be equivalent to the exact blocking when the time - odd fields of the energy density functional are neglected and then , it is sufficiently precise for most practical applications @xcite .",
    "effects of time - odd terms in hfb calculations have also been studied in ref .",
    "an extension of beyond - mean - field calculations , where the generator coordinate method is built from self - consistently blocked 1qp hfb states for odd - mass nuclei has recently been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the deformation in the decaying nuclei in both even - even and odd-@xmath1 cases , is self - consistently determined . in the odd-@xmath1 case , the core polarization induced by the odd particle",
    "is then taken into account .",
    "the effect found is however very small and we get very similar axial deformations in the even - even and neighbor odd - a nuclei",
    ". the small effect can be also observed in the gogny database @xcite , comparing the decs of the even - even and nearest odd-@xmath1 isotopes .",
    "since the gt operator of the allowed transitions is a pure spin - isospin operator without any radial dependence , one expects the spatial functions of the parent and daughter wave functions to be as close as possible in order to overlap maximally .",
    "then , transitions connecting different radial structures in the parent and daughter nuclei will be suppressed .",
    "thus , we assume similar shapes for the decaying parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus , neglecting core polarization effects in the daughter nuclei .",
    "this is a common assumption to deformed qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "that core polarization effects are small in both odd - odd case in relation to even - even parent and odd - even ( even - odd ) case in relation to the even - odd ( odd - even ) parent can be seen in the gogny database @xcite , where potential energy surfaces obtained from gogny hfb calculations are shown all along the nuclear chart . by comparing the surfaces of parent ( hg , pt ) and daughter ( au , ir ) isotopes considered in this work",
    ", one realizes that the profiles are very similar with practically no effect from core polarization due to the odd particles .",
    "the reduction in the transitions connecting different shapes have been quantified in the case of double @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the overlaps between the wave functions in the intermediate nucleus reached from different shapes of the parent and daughter nuclei are dramatically reduced when the deformations differ from each other . only with similar deformations",
    "the overlap is significant .",
    "consequently , given the small polarization effects and the suppression of the overlaps with different deformations , we consider in this work only gt transitions between parent and daughter partners with like deformations .",
    "to describe gt transitions , a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa @xcite .",
    "this interaction contains two parts , particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) .",
    "the interaction in the ph channel is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities .",
    "the ph residual interaction is finally expressed in a separable form by averaging the landau - migdal resulting force over the nuclear volume , as explained in ref .",
    "the pp component is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath33 coupling channel , which is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "its strength is usually fitted to reproduce globally the experimental half - lives .",
    "various attempts have been made in the past to fix this strength @xcite , arriving to expressions that depend on the model used to describe the mean field , nilsson model in the above reference . in previous works we studied the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to the various ingredients contributing to the deformed qrpa calculations , namely to the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction , to pairing correlations , and to residual interactions .",
    "we found different sensitivities to them . in this work ,",
    "all of these ingredients have been fixed to the most reasonable choices found previously @xcite .",
    "in particular we use the coupling strengths @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev for the ph and pp channels , respectively .",
    "the technical details to solve the qrpa equations have been described in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only mention that , because of the use of separable residual forces , the solutions of the qrpa equations are found by solving first a dispersion relation , which is an algebraic equation of fourth order in the excitation energy @xmath36 .",
    "then , for each value of the energy , the gt transition amplitudes in the intrinsic frame connecting the ground state @xmath37 of an even - even nucleus to one phonon states in the daughter nucleus @xmath38 are found to be    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 in terms of the occupation amplitudes for neutrons and protons @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the matrix elements of the spin operator , @xmath45 , connecting proton and neutron single - particle states , as they come out from the hf+bcs calculation . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the forward and backward amplitudes of the qrpa phonon operator , respectively .    once the intrinsic amplitudes in eq .",

    "the initial and final states in the laboratory frame have been expressed in terms of the intrinsic states using the bohr - mottelson factorization @xcite .",
    "when the parent nucleus has an odd nucleon , the ground state can be expressed as a one - quasiparticle ( 1qp ) state in which the odd nucleon occupies the single - particle orbit of lowest energy .",
    "then two types of transitions are possible .",
    "one type is due to phonon excitations in which the odd nucleon acts only as a spectator .",
    "these are three - quasiparticle ( 3qp ) states and the gt transition amplitudes in the intrinsic frame are basically the same as in the even - even case in eq .",
    "( [ intrinsic ] ) , but with the blocked spectator excluded from the calculation .",
    "the other type of transitions are those involving the odd nucleon state ( 1qp ) , which are treated by taking into account phonon correlations in the quasiparticle transitions in first - order perturbation .",
    "the transition amplitudes for the correlated states can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we refer the gt strength distributions to the excitation energy in the daughter nucleus . in the case of even - even decaying nuclei ,",

    "we get similar qualitative results with the three skyrme forces considered . more specifically",
    ", we obtain the same patterns of shape coexistence with minima located at practically the same deformations although the relative energies may change from one force to another .",
    "thus , we focus the discussion on the sly4 interaction .    in the case of hg isotopes ( fig . [ fig_e_beta_hg ] ) we get prolate and oblate minima in all the isotopes from @xmath89 up to @xmath90 .",
    "we can see that the ground state is predicted to be prolate for @xmath91hg and oblate for @xmath92hg isotopes .",
    "the transition occurs smoothly around @xmath93hg for sly4 , where we obtain two coexisting shapes at the same energy and it takes place around @xmath9hg ( @xmath94hg ) with sgii ( sk3 ) .",
    "similarly , in the case of pt isotopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_e_beta_pt ] ) we get prolate and oblate minima in all the isotopes from @xmath95 up to @xmath96 , but in this case the ground state is always prolate except in the heavier isotopes , @xmath97pt , where the oblate shape becomes ground state with the three forces .",
    "the transition is very smooth and the two shapes are practically degenerate between @xmath93pt and @xmath98pt for sly4 .",
    "except for the very light isotopes , we observe in both isotopic chains the existence of rather sharp oblate and prolate energy minima , close in energy and separated by very high energy barriers , giving raise to shape coexistence .",
    "these findings are in qualitative agreement with recent calculations @xcite . looking in more detail the results from different calculations , one observes differences and similarities within the various approaches",
    ". there are robust features common to all calculations , such as the existence of oblate and prolate minima located at similar deformations and separated by spherical barriers , or the isotopic evolution from oblate shapes in the heavier isotopes to prolate shapes in the lighter ones .",
    "but there are also particular features that change according to the different calculations , such as the height of the barriers or the relative energies between the minima that finally determines the exact isotope where the shape transition takes place .",
    "obviously , the exact location of the shape transition is very sensitive to small details of the calculation because the shape transition occurs precisely around the region where the energies of the competing shapes are practically degenerate .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the shape transition in pt isotopes predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite within a beyond mean field approach with the skyrme sly6 occurs at @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 in our calculation . in the same line",
    "triaxial d1m - gogny calculations predict a smooth shape transition at @xmath101 @xcite    similarly , the shape transition in pt isotopes in our calculations takes place at @xmath102 .",
    "this agrees with triaxial calculations with the gogny force that exhibit a smooth transition at @xmath103 , passing through a soft triaxial solution @xcite , as well as with the calculations in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the decs in pt isotopes were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , comparing the effects of different interactions ( sly4 , sly6 , gogny ) and pairing treatments ( constant strength , constant pairing gaps , density - dependent zero - range forces ) .",
    "little changes in the energy profiles were found within those treatments , but still enough to change the absolute minimum from one deformation to another in the transitional region around @xmath94pt , where the energies are practically degenerate . nevertheless , for the purpose of this work , the exact location at which the shape transitions occur is not of relevance .",
    "the important aspect in this work is that a shape competition is taken place and whether the sensitivity of the b(gt ) profiles to deformation can be used as a fingerprint of the nuclear shape .",
    "then , we choose in this work a reasonable mean - field based on the skyrme sly4 with constant pairing gaps . to be used as a starting point for a qrpa calculation of the decay properties .    to illustrate better the role of deformation in the isotopic evolution , we show in fig",

    "similarly , the @xmath57 values are displaced in an equivalent amount since the mass differences involved in the @xmath57 definitions are sensitive to the pairing energy in a similar way .    to show further the sensitivity of gt strength distributions to the spin and parity of the odd - a parent nucleus",

    "these are nuclei that are currently being considered as candidates to measure their gt strength distributions at isolde / cern , using the tas technique @xcite , and will complement the measurements already taken in pb and hg isotopes @xcite .",
    "obviously , the decay patterns should be affected by the spin and parity of the odd nucleon because they determine to a large extent the allowed spin and parities that can be reached in the daughter nucleus .",
    "this is especially true in the case of 1qp transitions where the odd nucleon involved determines the low - lying spectrum .",
