    "bi - stability is common in living systems .",
    "max delbrck was the first to associate different stable stationary states with different phenotypes , or epigenetic differences , in clonal populations such as those arising in the process of cell differentiation @xcite .",
    "starting from early experimental work of novick and wiener on _ lac - operon _ in _",
    "e.  coli _ , it has been believed that bi - stability can help organisms gain fitness in varying environmental conditions if the organism can switch phenotype following the environmental change .",
    "_ lac - operon _ is a collection of genes associated with transport and metabolism of lactose in the bacterium .",
    "expression of these genes can be turned on by molecules that have been called inducers .",
    "novick and weiner @xcite as well as cohn and horibata @xcite , relying on prior work of others @xcite , demonstrated that two phenotypes each associated with `` on '' and `` off '' state of _ lac - operon _ expression can be obtained from the same culture of genetically identical bacteria .",
    "the fraction of each corresponding sub - population depended on the history of exposure to the inducer . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hyst ] ,       the _ lac - operon _ state was induced ( switched on ) when the extracellular inducer concentration ( input ) exceeded an upper threshold .",
    "the operon was switched off when the inducer concentration fell below the lower threshold .",
    "both phenotypes remain stable through multiple generations of the bacterial culture after the extracellular concentration of the inducer is reduced to lower levels . novick and weiner did not use the term `` bi - stable switch '' ( non - ideal relay @xcite ) to describe their observations , but effectively that is what it was .",
    "difference in the reproductive rates of different phenotypes in different environments was also noted in their work suggesting association of phenotype bi - stability and switching with strategies for increasing population growth in varying environments .",
    "these early findings on the bi - stability of the _ lac - operon _ were consistent with earlier findings on stability of enzymes in yeast @xcite .",
    "recent experiments using molecular biology methods ( such as those incorporating green fluorescent protein expression under the _ lac - operon _ promoter ) permitted to confirm and further study the region of bi - stability of the _ lac - operon _ even when multiple input variables ( tmg that acts as the inducer and glucose , for example ) were used @xcite .",
    "furthermore , multi - stable gene expression and phenotype switching in varying environmental conditions have been well documented in many natural and artificially constructed biological systems @xcite .",
    "these experiments were complemented by a substantial body of theoretical work that demonstrated that organisms can gain fitness by adjusting the rate of switching between phenotypes , or switching thresholds , to the law of environmental variations .",
    "a typical setting for the analytical work has been an optimization problem where fitness ( measured , for example , by the average growth rate of the population ) is the utility function , each phenotype is optimal for a certain state of environment , and there is a cost associated with changing phenotype .",
    "this setting has been applied to models based on differential equations of population growth , switching systems and game theory @xcite .",
    "one well documented experimental fact , which can translate into the cost of phenotype switching , is the so - called lag phase that delays reproduction in an organism undergoing a switch .",
    "for example , in a simple ( stochastic ) differential equation model incorporating the lag phase , which was proposed in @xcite , the growth rate is maximized by a bi - stability range of a certain size that depends on the parameters of the environmental input .",
    "another related idea that has been explored in a similar modeling context is bet - hedging , that is a strategy promoting diversification whereby co - existence of several phenotypes , including those less fit to the current environmental conditions , can favor growth in varying environments @xcite .",
    "the bi - stable switch ( also known as the non - ideal relay ) is the simplest model of a bi - stable system . in particular",
    ", the differential model of phenotype switching proposed in @xcite reduces to the non - ideal relay in the limit of fast switching . in the present work , we are interested in the evolutionary process in a colony of two - phenotype bacteria where the competition for a resource ( nutrients in this case ) acts as a selection pressure",
    ". motivated by the fact that different bi - stability ranges are optimal ( ensure the fastest growth rate ) for different laws of variation of nutrients concentration , we model bacteria by non - ideal relays , which have all possible bi - stability ranges from a certain interval .",
    "moreover , we allow a diffusion process over the interval of admissible bi - stability ranges .",
    "we assume that each bacterium can sporadically change its switching threshold in response to noise in the environment or some internal processes ; also , a bacterium produces offsprings with different thresholds .",
    "further , these random changes of the threshold are assumed to occur according to the gaussian distribution .",
    "hence , diffusion imitates random variations of the bi - stability range that diversify switching thresholds in bacteria . in sum",
    ", the evolution is defined by two factors : competition and diffusive ( random ) changes of the bi - stability range .",
    "the resulting model describes dynamics of populations by a reaction - diffusion system with non - ideal relays continuously distributed over an interval of bi - stability ranges ; the system also includes integral terms in the equations for nutrients , describing the influence of bacteria on the environment .",
    "the well - posedness of this model was proved in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that each solution converges to a steady state distribution ( due to the diffusion , the concentration of bacteria distributes uniformly over all the interval of admissible bi - stability ranges ) .",
    "the model naturally admits a continual set of steady state solutions as there is a continuum of bi - stable elements .",
    "moreover , a numerical evidence was given that in case of slow diffusion solutions converge to steady states that can be naturally interpreted as patterns in the phenotype space .",
    "differential equations with non - ideal relays have been previously used to model reaction and diffusion processes in spatially distributed colonies of bacteria @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our setting , all relays in these models have been assumed identical ( that is , having the same bi - stability range ) , while spatial patterns appeared , in particular , due to the spatial diffusion of environmental substances .",
    "the mechanism of pattern formation in the phenotype space discussed in the present paper is different .",
    "the objective of this work is to rigorously prove that , in our setting , the patterns are created by the combined action of the slow diffusion and the switching process .",
    "furthermore , the proof allows us to determine the time scale of pattern formation and some of the pattern parameters .",
    "our results show that there is no single winner in the evolutionary game of the two competing phenotypes , but rather both phenotypes are present in the limit distribution of bacteria over the interval of available threshold values .",
    "this supports the idea that the bet - hedging strategy can be optimal for increasing fitness .",
    "it is shown that the complexity of the pattern in the limit distribution increases with decreasing diffusion rate in agreement with the numerical results presented in @xcite .",
    "further , we show that a steady state solution achieved in the long time limit depends on the initial state .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as a manifestation of the long term memory on the level of populations and agrees with earlier findings suggesting that memory in the switching strategy of individual bacteria can grant fitness in varying environments @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the attractor of the system is a connected continual set of stationary patterns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmodeldescription ]",
    ", we introduce the model : a system of reaction - diffusion equations with spatially distributed relays , and recall the well - posedness property from  @xcite . in section  [ secmainresults ] , we formulate our main results : pattern formation on two different time scales , depending on the initial data . in section  [ secfundamsol ] , we establish some properties of solutions of the heat equation with initial data close to the delta function .",
    "these properties play an essential role in sections  [ proof ] and  [ proof2 ] , where we prove the two main results about pattern formation .",
    "in this paper , we consider a class of models , which attempt to account for a number of phenomena listed above , namely ( a ) switching of bacteria between two phenotypes ( states ) in response to variations of environmental conditions ; ( b ) hysteretic switching strategy ( switching rules ) associated with bi - stability of phenotype states ; ( c ) heterogeneity of the population in the form of a distribution of switching thresholds ; ( d ) bet - hedging in the form of diffusion between subpopulations characterized by different bi - stability ranges ; and , ( e ) competition for nutrients .",
    "the resulting model is a reaction - diffusion system including , as reaction terms , discontinuous hysteresis relay operators and the integral of those .",
    "this integral can be interpreted as the preisach operator @xcite with a time dependent density ( the density is a component of the solution describing the varying distribution of bacteria ) .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to prove that fitness , competition and diffusion can act together to select a nontrivial distribution of phenotypes ( states ) over the population of thresholds .",
    "we assume that each of the two phenotypes , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , consumes a different type of nutrient ( for example , one consumes lactose and the other glucose ) . the amount of nutrient available for phenotype @xmath2 at the moment @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the model is based on the following assumptions ( see  @xcite for further discussion ) .    1 .",
    "each bacterium changes phenotype in response to the variations of the variable @xmath6 , which measures the deviation of the relative concentration of the first nutrient from the value 1/2 in the mixture of the two nutrients . 2 .   the input @xmath7 is mapped to the ( binary ) phenotype ( state ) of a bacterium @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the non - ideal relay operator with symmetric switching thresholds @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12",

    "we will denote by @xmath15 the density of the biomass of bacteria with given switching thresholds @xmath16 at a moment @xmath3 .",

    "5 .   at any particular time moment @xmath3 , for any given @xmath10 ,",
    "all the bacteria with the switching threshold values @xmath16 are in the same state ( phenotype ) .",
    "that is , @xmath15 is the total density of bacteria with the threshold @xmath10 at the moment @xmath3 and they are all in the same state .",
    "this means that when a bacterium with a threshold @xmath18 sporadically changes its threshold to a different value @xmath10 , it simultaneously copies the state from other bacteria which have the threshold  @xmath10 . in particular",
    ", this may require a bacterium to change the state when its threshold changes .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain the following model of the evolution of bacteria and nutrients , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the derivatives of the population density @xmath17 ;  @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient ; dot denotes the derivative with respect to time ; and all the non - ideal relays @xmath9 , @xmath23 $ ] , have the same input @xmath6 .",
    "we additionally assume the growth rate @xmath24 based on the mass action law for bacteria in the phenotype @xmath5 .",
    "the rate of the consumption of nutrient in the equation for @xmath25 is proportional to the total biomass of bacteria in the phenotype @xmath2 , hence the integral ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the lower and upper bounds on available threshold values , respectively .",
