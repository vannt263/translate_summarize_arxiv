    "the formation of relativistic jets is one of the fundamental issues in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) physics .",
    "the question how the jets form is relevant to supermassive black hole ( bh ) cases as well as x - ray binaries ( xrbs ; see reviews by fender 2003 ) .",
    "thanks to their short dynamical timescale , xrbs in various states have been observed in detail , and it is found that individual sources occupy particular accretion state with various x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , fender et al .",
    "2004 ; remilland & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "these observations suggested that at the low luminosity ( i.e. , the low mass accretion rate ) the jet power is a monotonic function of the accretion luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet power may change abruptly by a large factor , following transitions between the soft state ( a spectra characterized by the black body components ) and hard state ( a spectra characterized by the power - law components ) at the high luminosity ( i.e. , the high mass accretion rate ) . by analogy",
    "to xrbs , it is expected that the power of agn jets also depends on the mass accretion rates in a similar way .",
    "for example , rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) found that for the extended radio galaxies whose projected linear size ( @xmath2 ) is larger than @xmath3 kpc the jet power is proportional to the optical narrow line luminosity of nlrs which are photoionized by the nuclear continuum radiation ( see also willott et al .",
    "ghisellini & celotti ( 2001 ) claimed that the less powerful radio galaxies such as fanaroff - riley type i radio galaxies ( fr is ) exhibit the low accretion rate , while the powerful radio galaxies such as fanaroff - riley type ii radio galaxies ( fr iis ) show the high accretion rate .",
    "this work is consistent with a scenario ( e.g. , marchesini , celotti , & ferrarese 2004 ; wold et al .",
    "2007 ; hardcastle et al . 2007 ) that fr is have a radiatively inefficient accretion disk ( riaf ) ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ) , while fr iis have a standard accretion disk ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .    in investigating the disk - jet connection in agns ,",
    "however , we should keep in mind the relatively longer life time of the extended radio sources , i.e. , fr is and fr iis .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "the time - scale of the transition to the different physical states of the accretion disk is @xmath4 @xmath5 ( a few days @xmath6 a few weeks change ) for xrbs ( e.g. , fender et al .",
    "2004 ) . assuming @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the transition time - scale for agns is @xmath9 because of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the physical states of the accretion disk may change in less than the typical age of extended radio galaxies , i.e. , @xmath11 yr ( e.g. , parma et al .",
    "1999 ; bird , martini , & kaiser 2008 ) .",
    "in other words , the observed relation between the jet power and the accretion power for the extended radio galaxies may not be proving the direct disk - jet connection in agns .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the disk - jet connection in agns more directly , it is essential to examine the physical states of the accretion disk in younger radio galaxies .",
    "the young and compact radio galaxies such as compact symmetric objects ( csos ; @xmath12 1kpc ) and medium - size symmetric objects ( msos ; @xmath13 kpc ) have been discovered by several authors ( e.g. , wikinson et al . 1994 ; fanti et al .",
    "1995 ; readhead et al .",
    "1996 ) . among these compact radio sources ,",
    "the bright objects show the fr ii - like morphology along with hot spots ( reverse shocks ) , which are considered to be a signature of supersonic expansions ( owsianik , conway & polatidis 1998 ; taylor et al .",
    "2000 ; tschager et al .",
    "2000 ; giroletti et al . 2003 ; polatidis & conway 2003 ; gugliucci et al . 2005 ; nagai et al . 2006 ; gugliucci et al .",
    "2007 ; luo et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in contrast , the faint compact radio sources do not show hot spots ( e.g. , kunert - bajraszewska et al . 2005 ; giroletti 2007 ) and some of them show the fr i - like morphology ( giroletti 2007 ) .",
    "since the age of csos and msos is less than @xmath14 , they are recognized as newly born young agn jets ( e.g. , fanti et al .",
    "1995 ; readhead et al .",
    "1996 , odea & baum 1997 ; stanghellini et al . 1998",
    "; snellen et al . 2000",
    "; dallacasa et al .",
    "2000 ; orienti et al .",
    "thus , csos and msos are adequate targets to examine the disk - jet connection in agns since the time lag between the optical and radio activity is relatively small ( @xmath15 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will use bright csos and msos ( hereafter powerful young radio - loud [ yrl ] agns ) to investigate the disk - jet connection in agns .    in order to probe whether the formation of agn jets requires any specific accretion conditions",
    ", it is essential to determine the physical states of the accretion disk of powerful yrl agns . to this end",
    ", it can be useful to examine a systematic difference in the seds produced by accretion disks of powerful yrl agns and radio - quiet ( rq ) agns .",
    "however , it is challenging to derive the intrinsic seds of powerful yrl agns from the hard x - ray observations , because of the contamination of agn jets and the obscuration of the accretion disk by the dusty torus .",
    "alternatively , the optical emission - line diagnostics of narrow - line region ( nlr ) can be used to distinguish the physical states of the accretion disk , since the nlr is thought to be photoionized by the nuclear radiation for rq seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , yee 1980 ; shuder & osterbrock 1981 ; evans et al . 1999 ) and even for extended radio galaxies ( e.g. , villar - martin et al .",
    "1997 ; nagao et al .",
    "however , very little is currently known about the optical emission - line properties of powerful yrl agns . by examining the difference of optical line ratios between powerful yrl agns and the extended radio galaxies , morganti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that powerful yrl agns show the characteristics very similar to that of extended radio galaxies .",
    "however , it is not clear how the physical state of accretion disks ( especially seds of accretion disks ) is different between the powerful yrl agns and the rq agns .",
    "answering this question will provide crucial information on the disk - jet connection in agns .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate whether there is the difference in seds between the powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies ( i.e. , rq agns ) , by utilizing the optical emission - line diagnostics of nlrs .",
    "we collected samples of powerful yrl agns and rq agns (  2 ) , and generated various photoionization models with different input seds (  3 ) . in  4 , we compared the observational data with models .",
    "on the basis of our findings , discussion on accretion conditions for the formation of powerful agn jets is presented in  5 , and conclusions follow in  6 .",
    "we focus on the properties of ionized gas in nlrs for powerful yrl agns to investigate the disk - jet connection . to reduce possible inclination effects ,",
    "it is important to compare agns with the same optical type , since the optical narrow emission line ratios are often affected by the geometrical effects ( e.g. , murayama & taniguchi 1998 ; schmitt 1998 ; nagao , murayama , & taniguchi 2000 ; nagao , murayama , & taniguchi 2001a ) . out of 219 radio galaxies available in the literature , we compiled 32 yrl agns ( 20 narrow - line agns and 12 broad - line agns ) with the optical spectra , from which the stellar continuum is subtracted , and high radio luminosity , @xmath16 , using papers by pearson & readhead ( 1988 ) , tadhunter et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and odea ( 1998 ) . since only few broad - line yrl agns have the detected emission lines ( e.g. , [ oi]@xmath06300 line , [ oii]@xmath03727 and [ oii]@xmath05007 ) which are essential for our study , we finally selected 20 _ narrow - line _ yrl agns with these lines . in other words ,",
    "the yrl agn sample consists only of radio galaxies .",
    "the properties of powerful yrl agns are presented in table 1 .",
    "the mean projected linear size of selected radio sources is @xmath17 , which is small enough to discuss the disk - jets connection in agns ( see @xmath18 ) . the average radio power at 5 ghz",
    ", @xmath19 is @xmath20 , comparable to powerful extended radio galaxies ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) .",
    "note that the radio power of the faint yrl agns , excluded from our sample , is @xmath21 ( e.g. , giroletti 2007 ) .",
    "we use only the forbidden lines to avoid the difficulty of separating the broad component and the narrow component of the recombination lines ( e.g. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 lines ) .",
    "then , we compiled the flux ratios of forbidden emission - lines from the literature ( table 2 ) . the typical errors of each line are @xmath24 .    to compare with narrow - line yrl agns , we selected a sample of rq seyfert 2 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) archive , using the emission - line flux catalog made by the mpa / jhu group ( kauffmann et al .",
    "we selected 624 rq seyferts , of which first images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ) flux is lower than 1 mjy and optical emission - line fluxes are well - measured from high s / n ( @xmath25 ) sdss spectra .    in this paper , we do not evaluate the amount of extinction of host galaxies based on the balmer decrement method ( e.g. , osterbrock 1989 ) , since for only few sources in the powerful yrl agn sample detected were both the narrow h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 lines .",
    "the data presented in table 2 are not corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the effect of dust extinction on our results will be discussed in  4.1 .",
    "to characterize seds produced by the accretion disk in powerful yrl agns , we will compare emission line properties with photoionization models .",
    "we will examine whether there is a systematic difference in seds from accretion disks between the powerful yrl agns and the rq agns .",
    "the continuum radiation from the accretion disk photoionizes the nlr , hence , the difference in the sed can be related to the difference in the physical states of the nlr .",
    "then , we compare the observed flux ratios with photoionization model calculations , using the publicly available code cloudy , version 06.02c ( ferland 1998 ) .    the method of our calculations is based on solving the equations of statistical equilibrium , the ionization and thermal equilibrium through gas clouds as a function of depth .",
    "then , we obtain the ionization structure of gas in nlrs and the volume emissivity of the forbidden emission lines ( i.e. , [ oi]@xmath06300 , [ oii]@xmath03727 , [ sii]@xmath06717 + 6731 , [ oiii]@xmath0 5007 and [ neiii]@xmath03869 ) . here",
    "we briefly describe the adopted parameterizations .",
    "we assume uniform density gas clouds with a plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the parameters for the calculations are ( i ) the hydrogen density ( @xmath28 ) ; ( ii ) the ionization parameter ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of the ionizing photons emitted by agns per second ) , which is defined as the ratio of the ionizing density to the hydrogen density ; ( iii ) the chemical composition of the gas ; ( iv ) the shape of seds of the input continuum radiation .",
    "while the gas metallicity is assumed to be solar ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ; holweger 2001 ) , we carry out a series of model runs covering various density and ionization parameters : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    for the input continuum",
    "radiation , we consider two types of seds .",
    "one is a typical sed produced by a standard accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , which is characterized by a strong big blue bump ( bbb ) in the wavelength range of uv to soft x - ray . as a template of this type of sed ( hereafter , sed with bbb ) , we adopt the empirical expression using the following function ( see ferland 1997 ; nagao et al .",
    "2001b ) : @xmath33 where the infrared cutoff of the bbb component , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , the characteristic temperature of the bbb , @xmath36 , the slope of the low - energy side of the bbb , @xmath37 , the uv to x - ray spectral index , @xmath38 and the slope of the x - ray power - law continuum , @xmath39 which are typical values of seyfert galaxies ( see nagao et al .",
    "2001b for more details ) .",
    "since the characteristic temperature of the bbb in some extreme agns , e.g. , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , can reach at @xmath40 , we will discuss the effects of changing @xmath41 on the line flux ratios . note that the parameter @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is determined from the adopted value of @xmath43 . the last term in equation ( 1 )",
    "is set to zero below 1.36 ev , and the continuum is assumed to fall off as @xmath44 above 100 kev .",
    "the other kind of sed is a typical sed produced by a riaf , which is expected to show a power - law with no strong bbb as shown by various works ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995 ; chen , abramowicz , & lasota 1997 ; narayan , kato , & honma 1997 ; manmoto , mineshige & kusunose 1997 ; kurpiewski & jaroszynski 1999 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ; manmoto 2000 ; kino , kaburaki , & yamazaki 2000 ; ohsuga , kato & mineshige 2005 ; yuan , ma & narayan 2008 ) .",
    "we adopt here the sed model presented by kurpiewski & jaroszynski ( 1999 ) as the template for seds of riaf ( hereafter sed without bbb ) .",
    "this sed can be expressed by a single power - law continuum in the range of @xmath45 hz to @xmath46 hz , with the exponential cutoffs at @xmath47 ryd and @xmath48 ryd .",
    "we choose the photon index of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , as predicted for the case of a non - rotating black hole .",
    "since there are various shapes of the calculated sed for a riaf ( i.e. , various @xmath51 ) , we will check the effect of altering @xmath51 in the wide range of @xmath52 .    using these two sed templates for a standard disk and riaf , respectively ( see figure 3 in nagao et al .",
    "2002 ) , we calculate emission line flux ratios using cloudy . these simple sed templates can be used to elucidate the effect of the presence or absence of the bbb component , which is the main difference in the sed between a standard disk and riaf .",
    "note that these template might be too simple to generate accurate narrow - emission line fluxes in agns .",
    "the calculations are stopped when the temperature falls below 3000 k , where the gas does not contribute significantly to the observed optical emission line spectra .",
    "in this section , we compare the photoionization model calculations with observed emission line properties of powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies .      the emission line ratio , [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 , of the nlr can be used to characterize the sed of accretion disk since the line ratio depends on the shape of sed of the photoionizing source .",
    "the harder spectra ( without bbb ) of optically thin disks create larger ratios [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 due to the following reasons .",
    "the mean free path of ionizing photons at higher energies becomes longer , since the cross section for ionization of hydrogen ( @xmath53(h ) ) is given by @xmath54 for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the frequency of the lyman limit . with a flat power - law spectrum ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "a relatively large number of photons are available at higher energies even after the photons near the lyman limit are all absorbed around the ionization front .",
    "then , the higher energy photons can reach at larger radii from the ionization source , hence , the extended partially ionized region can be formed .",
    "furthermore , the low - ionization emission arises in the extended partially ionized region rather than the fully ionized region where the abundance of neutral oxygen is negligible .",
    "therefore , the volume emissivity of low - ionization emission lines ( i.e. , [ oi]@xmath58 ) can be higher at larger radii from the ionization sources , compared to that of high - ionization emission lines ( i.e. , [ oiii]@xmath59 ) ( see figure 5 of nagao et al .",
    "note that the ionization potential of neutral oxygen is nearly identical to that of hydrogen .",
    "figure 1 represents emission line ratios ( [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath605007 versus [ oii]@xmath03727/[oiii]@xmath05007 ) from our model calculations and observations . the horizontal axis ( [ oii]@xmath03727/[oiii]@xmath05007 ) indicates the difference of @xmath28 because the critical density of [ oii]@xmath03727 ( @xmath61 ) is far smaller than that of [ oiii]@xmath05007 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this set is free from the chemical abundance effect .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , powerful yrl agns have relatively higher [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 than seyfert 2 galaxies , implying that there is a difference in the shape of ionizing continuum .",
    "the observed line ratios were not corrected for both the galactic extinction or internal extinction of host galaxies .",
    "instead , we indicate by the arrow ( upper left in figure 1 ) the effect of dust extinction when the dust - extinction correction of @xmath63 mag is applied , assuming a standard galactic reddening law ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) . for type 1 agns ,",
    "the dust reddening of nlr emission is small ( @xmath64 mag ; e.g. , rodriguez - ardila et al .",
    "the dust - extinction of nlrs for type 2 agns is approximately 1.0 mag larger than that for type 1 agns ( e.g. , de zotti & gaskell 1985 ; dahari & de robertis 1988 ) .",
    "the models using sed without bbb predict higher [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 ratio than the models using sed with bbb .",
    "the trend of the model prediction coincides with the observations .",
    "the line ratios of seyfert 2 galaxies are consistent with models adopting the sed with bbb in the range of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , while the line ratios of powerful yrl agns can be explained by the model adopting the sed without bbb .",
    "note that the derived @xmath28 may not reflect the actual number density of narrow - line clouds because of the dust extinction effects .",
    "however , the direction of extinction correction is perpendicular to the direction of the difference between powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies , indicating that the observed difference is not due to the difference in the degree of the dust extinction between powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies .    in figure 2",
    ", we present the frequency distributions of @xmath67[oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 ) for the powerful yrl agns ( blue ) and seyfert 2 galaxies ( red ) .",

    "similar to the trend in figure 1 , powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies are well separated in these diagnostic diagrams , suggesting that the different line ratios of powerful yrl agns can be explained by models with the photoionizing sed without bbb . however , one may doubt that the difference of sed is not a unique solution to explain the observed differences .",
    "thus , we discuss the other possibilities for high [ oi ] @xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 ratios in @xmath71 .      here , we examine the dependence of emission line ratios on the model input parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath51 .",

    "the strong low - ionization emission lines such [ oi]@xmath58 causes by the shock - heated gas ( e.g. , mouri , kawara , & taniguchi 2000 and references therein ) because shocks generate a large partially ionized region in the gas . to investigate whether or not the shock heating by agn jets is responsible for the difference in the narrow emission - line ratio between powerful yrl agns and rq agns , we compare the observed line ratios with shock models in figure 7 .",
    "the adopted shock models with / without considering the effect of precursor are presented by dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) .",

    "to explain all observations ( figure 1 and figure 3 ) by shock models , a fine - tunning of model parameters should be required .",
    "thus , these results suggest that the difference in the narrow - line flux ratios of powerful yrl agns are not mainly caused by the shock - heated gas in nlrs . however",

    "2000 ; odea et al .",
    "2002 ; holt et al .",
    "2008 ; labiano et al .",
    "ii ) gas density .",
    "the systematic difference in the gas density in nlr may cause the different line ratios , because the critical density of [ oi]@xmath06300 transition ( @xmath78 ) is larger than that of [ oiii]@xmath05007 transition ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this possibility can be easily rejected as shown in figure 1 and figure 3 . at given ionization parameter @xmath74 , the ratio of [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 does not depend on the gas density , if we employ only the models with seds with bbb .",

    "we consider the difference in the ionization parameter @xmath74 between powerful yrl agns and rq agns .",
    "since the effect of the sed difference and changing the ionization parameter ( i.e. , the ratio of the ionizing photon density to the hydrogen density ) are often degenerated ( see nagao et al .",
    "2002 ) , a systematic difference in the ionization parameter of gas in nlrs between powerful yrl agns and rq agns can explain the difference in the emission line ratios [ oi]@xmath58/[oiii]@xmath05007 when we fix @xmath28 . as shown in figure 1 and figure 3 ( bottom ) , we find that only different @xmath74 can not explain the difference of line ratios between powerful yrl agns and rq agns",

    "thus , it can be better constrained whether the seds of yrl agns are different from those of seyfert 2 galaxies .",

    "2006).}})= 1.5\\pm 0.5 $ ] and @xmath96 then , the average bolometric luminosity of yrl agns , @xmath97 , is required to produce the observed [ oiii ] line luminosity .",
    "this suggests that @xmath98 is @xmath99 for the massive bhs ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "hence , it seems difficult to explain the bolometric luminosity of powerful yrl agns with the riaf model , because of @xmath101 .",
    "the combination of emission line ratios and the bolometric luminosity estimates implies that the physical nature of the accretion disk of yrl agns can not be explained by either the classical steady disk , i.e. , a standard disk or a riaf .",
    "it might imply that the relativistic jet occur in a non steady accretion disk .",
    "interestingly , the physical states of accretion disks in some xrbs ( e.g. , gx 339@xmath64 ) associated with relativistic jets are similar to those of yrl agns ( homan et al . 2005 ; remillard 2005 ) , suggesting the similarity of disk - jet connection in xrbs and agns",
    ". this similarity may indicate that the formation of relativistic jets requires luminous accretion disk with harder ionizing sed .",
    "however , we note that the bolometric luminosity estimated from [ oiii ] luminosity is highly uncertain for both luminous agns and llagns without bbb .",
    "thus , it is crucial to reduce the uncertainty of bolometric luminosity by evaluating the bolometric correction using a large sample of broad - line yrl agns , which are left in our future works .",
    "we discuss here why the line ratios , @xmath67[oiii]@xmath05007/[oiii]@xmath1024363 ) , of powerful yrl agns is smaller than that of seyfert 2 galaxies . as we investigated in  4 , several optical narrow line emission ratios ( [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 , [ oii]@xmath03727/[oiii]@xmath05007 , [ sii]@xmath06717 + 6731/[oiii]@xmath05007 and [ neiii]@xmath03869/[oii]@xmath03727 ) can be well explained by single - zone photoionization models .",
    "however , it has been well - known that any one - zone models overpredicts the flux ratio of [ oiii ] @xmath05007/[oiii]@xmath04363 ( e.g. , koski & osterbrock 1976 ; heckman 1980 ; ferland & netzer 1983 ; rose & cecil 1983 ; keel & miller 1983 ; rose & tripicco 1984 ) .    by taking high - density gas clouds into account in nlrs , nagao et al .",
    "( 2001c ) reported that photoionization models can explain low emission - line flux ratios of [ oiii]@xmath05007/[oiii]@xmath694363 @xmath103 , without including shock effects .",
    "this idea is attributed to the fact that the critical density of [ oiii]@xmath04363 ( @xmath104 ) is higher than that of [ oiii]@xmath05007 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in addition , they suggested that the [ oiii]@xmath04363 originates in the dense gas clouds which are located at the inner regions compared with [ oiii]@xmath05007 , hence , a large fraction of gas clouds emitting [ oiii]@xmath04363 line are obscured in type 2 agns .",
    "this idea is supported by the observations that the line ratios of [ oiii]@xmath05007/[oiii]@xmath04363 of seyfert 2 galaxies are larger than those of seyfert 1 galaxies ( nagao et al .",
    "if this is the case , the difference in [ oiii]@xmath59/[oiii]@xmath04363 may reflect the difference in the structure of duty torus , i.e. , the difference of the geometrical thickness .",
    "we should emphasize that the difference in figure 5 ( also figure 6 ) is not related to the inclination effect , because we compare the same optical types of agns , i.e. , powerful narrow - line yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "since the ratio [ oiii]@xmath59/[oiii]@xmath04363 of powerful yrl agns is lower than that of seyfert 2 galaxies , the obscuring torus of powerful yrl agns may be thinner than that of seyfert 2 galaxies ( see figure 8) . according to a recent coevolution model of the bh growth and the circumnuclear disk ( kawakatu & wada 2008",
    "; see also wada & norman 2002 ) , the mass accretion rate onto a central bh driven by the turbulent viscosity is higher as the scale height of circumnuclear disk increases .",
    "this is because the angular momentum transfer due to the turbulence is proportional to the the scale height . to test our scenario ,",
    "it is crucial to examine the difference in the structure of obscuring torus , using atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .    in summary ,",
    "our findings indicate that the powerful yrl agns favor the accretion disk without bbb , surrounded by the geometrically thin obscuring torus , while seyfert 2 galaxies prefer the accretion disk with bbb , surrounded by the geometrically thick torus ( see figure 8) .",
    "these results suggest that the formation of the powerful agn jet is related to the physical states of accretion disks and structure of obscuring materials around the accretion disk .",
    "we examine the optical narrow emission - line flux ratios of nlrs , in order to determine whether the formation of powerful agn jets requires specific accretion conditions . a sample of powerful yrl agns , which are at the early stage of the jet activity , and radio - quiet seyfert 2 galaxies are selected .",
    "we summarize our main results .",
    "1 .   powerful yrl agns exhibit larger flux ratios of [ oi]@xmath06300/[oiii]@xmath05007 than rq seyfert 2 galaxies . by comparing the observed line ratios with the photoionization model calculations , we find that the difference between powerful yrl agns and seyfert 2 galaxies can be well understood by the difference in seds of ionizing radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "the powerful yrl agns favor sed without a strong bbb such as the adaf , while the line ratios of seyfert 2 galaxies are consistent with the models adopting sed with a strong bbb ( a geometrically thin , optically thick disk ) .",
    "in contrast , the observed difference in the line ratios is difficult to explain by the difference in the contribution of shocks caused by the agn jets .",
    "the line ratio [ oiii]@xmath59/[oiii]@xmath694363 of powerful yrl agns is systematically smaller than that of rq agns . if we adopt a scenario that [ oiii]@xmath04363 originates in the dense gas clouds , which are located at the inner regions compared with [ oiii]@xmath05007 , it is inferred that the obscuring torus around powerful yrl agns would be thinner than that around seyfert galaxies .",
