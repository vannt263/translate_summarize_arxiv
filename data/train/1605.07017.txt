    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : susceptibilityvectors ] the brillouin zone is shifted by a vector @xmath127 , because the relevant vectors @xmath53 connect pieces of the fermi surface across the boundaries of the brillouin zone used in fig .",
    "[ fig : susceptibilitycomparison ] .",
    "now we come back to the discussion of the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : susceptibilitycomparison ] . at @xmath141 peaks appear at @xmath142 and @xmath143 , the dominant contribution to the spin susceptibility being the peak at @xmath131 .",

    "even the case @xmath138 does not reproduce the dimer model spin susceptibility exactly .",
    "the similarities are however apparent .",
    "these peak shifts in the spin susceptibility are reflected in the pairing symmetry : the gap maxima of different sign in the @xmath2-symmetry are separated by a wave - vector @xmath130 , while @xmath131 is responsible for the sign change between the upper and lower half of the elliptic fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , @xmath131 enforces an enlarged nodal region close to @xmath145 , since it would otherwise connect parts of the fermi surface with the same sign of the gap . in the intermediate region of @xmath134",
    ", @xmath131 connects the 1d parts of the fermi surface , where it induces an additional set of nodes .",
    "the large gap on the elliptic part of the fermi surface is connected to the 1d sheets by @xmath130 .",
    "the shift of the vertical lines in the susceptibility , which widen towards @xmath146 , merely reflect the changing shape of the fermi surface . for @xmath140 the additional set of nodes on the 1d sheets vanishes , because they are no longer connected by @xmath131 , which now instead points from 1d sheet to the elliptic parts just like @xmath147 .",
    "this consideration shows that the pairing - symmetry transition in the molecule model is driven by a peculiar competition between @xmath130 and @xmath131 nesting vectors .",
    "now we connect the structure of the susceptibility and the superconducting pairing to the underlying lattice model .",
    "the feature at @xmath130 is obviously connected to the @xmath14 hopping parameter , since it is the only hopping exclusively in @xmath33-direction ( compare fig .",

    "all other @xmath16-parameters can only be responsible for a four - peak structure , as they occur pointing along both diagonals of the physical unit cell .",

    "we also take into account the associated extended @xmath5-wave function , because we expect that a significant extended @xmath5-wave component could mix with the @xmath6-wave states to accomodate the orthorhombicity of the model :    @xmath149    [ eq : symmfunctions ]    rotated into the brillouin zone of @xmath0-type materials , gap functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 are to be expected from antiferromagnetic exchange along square - like bonds ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) , while @xmath152 and @xmath153 correspond to exchange paths along diagonal bonds ( @xmath14 ) , see fig .",

    "our findings provide a clear picture of the pairing competition in the molecule model : in the realistic region of parameters , where the dimerization measured by @xmath133 and the anisotropy of @xmath13 and @xmath15 are finite , the competition of square - like ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) and diagonal ( @xmath14 ) hopping realizes a unique linear combination of functions @xmath153 and @xmath151 as the leading pairing symmetry .",
    "we refer to this linear combination as @xmath159 , or extended @xmath20 .",

    "when the lattice becomes more square - like @xmath161 , i.e. the molecule model approaches the dimer limit , the @xmath2-symmetry known from the dimer model takes over . in other words , in the context of realistic modelling of @xmath0-type materials , the @xmath2 symmetry found in the dimer model ( @xmath8 in the unfolded one - band model ) is mostly an artifact of the underlying approximation to the real lattice structure ( eq .  [ eq : geometricformulas ] ) .",
    "finally , we checked our results obtained with the four parameter molecule model against the original hopping structure obtained from projective wannier functions , which includes longer range processes .",
    "as expected , the differences induced by the distance cutoff and parameter averaging are negligible .",
    "to complete our study of the pairing symmetry competition , we investigated the leading pairing symmetry of the molecule model as a function of @xmath162 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the range of parameters realized in actual superconducting @xmath0-type materials .    in fig .",

    "the size of the @xmath2-symmetric region is obviously determined by the value of @xmath120 as explained in the previous section .    in the numerical calculations we observed that the leading two pairing symmetries are almost degenerate in a broad parameter region .",
    "this is to be expected , because the @xmath159 state emerges precisely as a compromise between two different nesting vectors , of which one rather fits to a pure @xmath2-symmetry . to clarify this degeneracy , we calculated the eigenvalues of the leading and sub - leading solutions of the gap equation at fixed @xmath162 and @xmath119 and varied @xmath134 in the range [ 0,1 ] .",

    "<S> the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in quasi - two - dimensional bedt - ttf organic superconductors is a subject of ongoing debate . </S>",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of the superconducting pairing symmetry within this model and point out a phase - transition between extended @xmath1 and @xmath2 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the origin of the mixed order parameter and the relation between the realistic molecule description and the widely used dimer approximation . based on our _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations we position the investigated materials in the obtained molecule model phase diagram and simulate scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments for selected cases . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that many @xmath0-type materials lie close to the phase transition line between the two pairing symmetry types found in our calculation , possibly explaining the multitude of contradictory experiments in this field . </S>"
