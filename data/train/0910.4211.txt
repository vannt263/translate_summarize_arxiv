    "the correct sign of @xmath7 is established thanks to the matter effects in solar neutrino oscillation .",
    "the neutrino oscillation results require that neutrinos have masses and there are at least three distinct masses .",
    "however , the neutrino oscillation between the first and the third generation has not been found . currently there is a limit on the mixing angle @xmath2 from the chooz reactor experiment@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see if this mixing angle is nonzero .",
    "t2k is a second generation long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment to measure oscillation parameters , especially the mixing angle @xmath2 through @xmath3 appearance from a @xmath8 beam .",
    "the t2k @xmath8 beam is generated using the high intensity 50 gev proton synchrotron at j - parc in tokai , japan and the far detector is super - kamiokande which is located 295 km from the accelerator . the near detector is being built and installed 280 m from the target .",
    "we will briefly review the theory of neutrino oscillations in the next section and describe various components of the experiment in the following sections .",
    "neutrino mixing is a direct consequence of neutrino masses . in this case",
    "the weak eigenstates @xmath9 , i.e. , states that are produced from weak decays , are not the same as the mass eigenstates @xmath10 , but instead are linear combination of the mass eigenstates , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mixing matrix .",
    "the mixing matrix is usually parameterized using three mixing angles @xmath13 and one cp violation phase @xmath14@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the full oscillation probability is complicated , but when neglecting the cp violation terms and matter effects , the oscillation probability becomes@xcite @xmath22 it is noticed that the amplitude of the oscillation is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the measurement of this oscillation channel will give a direct measurement of the mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "the t2k experiment aims to measure the mixing angle @xmath2 through @xmath3 appearance .",
    "it is noted that the appearance probability ( [ appearance ] ) also depends on the atmospheric oscillation parameters ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "for this reason , the t2k experiment will measure both these oscillation parameters and the mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "* @xmath8 disappearance * the oscillation parameters ( @xmath24 ) will be determined from the survival probability of @xmath8 after traveling 295 km .",
    "this probability can be measured by comparing the neutrino spectra at the near and far site .",
    "the neutrino spectrum at the near site is measured by the near detector system .",
    "the neutrino flux is also measured at the near site and extrapolated to the far site to obtain the correct rate normalization . at the far site ,",

    "electrons from @xmath3 quasi - elastic charged - current interactions are detected by the presence of a electron - like ring .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath8 interactions are further reduced by requiring that there is no decay electron .",
    "after this , there are two main backgrounds to the @xmath3 search at super - kamiokande : the background from single @xmath25 from neutral current interactions and @xmath3 intrinsic to the beam .",
    "these backgrounds are measured by the near detector system before oscillation and extrapolated to super - kamiokande . the estimated @xmath25 and intrinsic @xmath3 backgrounds are subtracted from the selected @xmath3 events .",

    "the neutrino beam is produced by smashing protons from the j - parc proton synchrotron on a target .",
    "the main synchrotron is designed to accelerate protons up to 50 gev , however , the initial proton energy is limited to 30 gev .",
    "the proton beam is extracted by the neutrino primary beamline .",
    "the neutrino beamline consists of 28 combined function superconducting magnets which produce both dipole and quadrapole fields and normal magnets near the final focusing sections .",
    "the design intensity of the proton beam is @xmath34 at the rate of about @xmath35 hz .",

    "three electromagnetic horns are used to focus ( and select the right charge sign ) charged pions generated in the target to the forward direction .",
    "the target is installed inside the inner conductor of the first horn to collect and focus the pions as much as possible .",
    "these horns are driven by a pulsed current of 320 ka synchronized with the beam . the focused pions decay into @xmath8 and muons in a 110 m decay tunnel which follows the horns .",
    "there is a small fraction of @xmath3 ( about .5% at peak energy ) produced by decaying muons and kaons .",

    "it exploits the kinematics of pion decay that the neutrino energy is not strongly dependent on the pion energy at a fixed decay angle in the lab frame to produce a narrow - band beam ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the narrow - band beam is desired to maximize the neutrino flux at energies near the first oscillation maximum .",
    "the off - axis angle can be changed from 2.0 to 3.0 degrees .",
    "this corresponds to the mean neutrino energies from 0.5 to 0.9 gev .",
    "the nominal off - axis angle is 2.5 degrees , corresponding to the peak beam energy of about 0.7 gev .",
    "the schematic of the t2k neutrino beam is shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .        because of the off - axis beam configuration , the neutrino spectrum at super - kamiokande is sensitive to the neutrino beam direction . for this reason",
    "there are two detector systems designed specifically for online neutrino beam monitoring : one is a muon monitor and the other is an on - axis neutrino detector .",

    "the on - axis neutrino detector monitors the neutrino beam directly using neutrino interactions .",
    "the muon monitor and the on - axis neutrino detector are described below .",
    "the muon monitor is placed downstream of the beam dump and monitors the direction , profile , time structure , and intensity of the beam by detecting high energy muons which are produced together with the neutrinos . thanks to the high muon flux , the mumon is sensitive to the proton hit position on the target and the status of the target and horns .",
    "therefore , it is also used as a proton beam monitor , a target monitor , and a horn monitor .",
    "the measurements of mumon can monitor the quality of the neutrino beam on a spill - by - spill basis . finally , the mumon helps aim the neutrino beam at super - kamiokande during the beginning of the experiment .",

    "the other dominant background to the @xmath3 appearance search is the @xmath3 beam contamination which is about 0.5% of the @xmath8 flux at peak energy .",
    "this background is resulted from kaon and muon decays , it can not be removed from the @xmath8 beam and must be measured by the near detector .",
    "one of the purpose of the tracker is to measure this background .",
    "the tracker also measures @xmath8 flux and spectrum before oscillation for @xmath8 disapperance study .",
