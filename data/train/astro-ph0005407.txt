    "the crab nebula represents the class of pleronic supernova remnants ; it contains a pulsar as a central energy source and a well  organised magnetic field indicated by strong linear polarization at radio wavelengths and relatively flat radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "a number of detected snrs have radio characteristics similar to the , yet the pulsar stimulation of the synchrotron nebula is confirmed for just a few of them @xcite . is classified as a crab  type remnant because of its centre  filled morphology , flat radio spectrum @xcite , and strong soft x ",

    "however , our current investigation at a shorter wavelength shows a significant level of polarization .",
    "all of the data together confirm the classification of as a crab  type snr .",
    "the presence of in a relatively dense and complex interstellar environment together with the younger sn1987a and the presumably older snr 0540693 , offers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of crab  type snrs in such areas .",
    "the best galactic examples , the crab and 3c58 , both appear to be in exceptionally low ",

    "the first obervations at 6 cm were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in the period january ",
    "july 1993 .",
    "additional observations at 3.5 and 6 cm were obtained during may 1998  june 1999 .",
    "the six antennas were used in several different array configurations giving baselines with the range from 31 m to 6 km to provide good sampling of the observed region .",
    "details of the atca can be found in @xcite .",
    "the relevant observing parameters are given in table [ tbl - obs ] .",

    "pks b0454810 was used as secondary calibration source .",
    "the observations in 1998  1999 were done in mosaic mode with 20 pointing centres to cover the whole region .",
    "the observing pattern was such that the pointing nearest to the snr ( field no.15  see table[tbl - obs ] ) was observed after every five fields to improve signal  to  noise on this object .",
    "the data were taken simultaneously in 32@xmath74mhz frequency channels of which the 26 central channels are used in the imaging procedure .",
    "they have been averaged down to 13@xmath78mhz channels by hanning smoothing and then to a single channel during imaging .",
    "the data were gridded and deconvolved according to the procedure for mosaic data sets @xcite .",
    "separate images of field no.15 alone were also produced .",
    "the 3.5cm images of the snr were made by combining 7 fields ( including no.15 ) which had the pointing centre closest to the snr .",
    "the deconvolution of all 7 fields was done together , which improves the deconvolution process but introduces some errors in the model of the primary beam .",
    "the edges of the mosaiced region have low sensitivity so the noise level across the mosaic image will vary . in the imaging process the primary beam attenuation will not be completely corrected , because that correction is constrained by the noise in the individual pointings , which can differ @xcite . in this case",
    ", the procedure limits the dynamic range of the final image to 100:1 .",
    "we also made an image of field no.15 alone .",
    "this was cleaned and corrected for the pattern of the primary beam .",
    "the peak brightness in both images is very close ( @xmath07mjy / beam ) , but the single field image has lower signal  to  noise ratio over the entire field .",
    "the image at 6 cm was constructed by combining four data sets at 4.8ghz and pointing no.15 from 4.4ghz data ( see table  [ tbl - obs ] ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the mosaicing procedure explained above , the multi ",
    "frequency synthesis technique @xcite was also used to produce the final image of the region . as in the previous case ,",
    "an image of field no.15 alone was made as well .",
    "the interferometer produces an instrumental polarization which increases outward from the center of the primary beam pattern of the individual telescopes . in fields with the pointing centre away from the snr for which an unpolarized source ( 30 doradus ) is at the half",
    "power point , we found fractional polarizations up to @xmath010% with electric field vectors radially oriented with respect to the direction of the beam centre .",
    "this value of fractional polarization in the surrounding fields confirms that off ",
    "centre instrumental polarization is indeed strong .",
    "therefore , for the polarimetry we used only field no.15 for which is in the center of the beam and the instrumental polarization is low ( 0.3% ) .",
    "the images of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 stokes parameters were made in a similar way as the @xmath10 image and combined to produce the image of polarized intensity .",
    "to create such an image we used the miriad task impol which statistically corrects the polarized intensity for ricean bias @xcite .",
    "noise in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 polarization images was below the 5@xmath11 noise level of the total intensity image and cleaning was not necessary .",
    "the polarized intensity images of the snr at 6 cm were made using only field no.15 with the same procedure as for the single ",
    "field image explained above .",
    "the 1993 positions were not directly toward n157b and so were not included in the polarization analysis because of the off  axis effects disscussed above . the fractional polarization in the direction of was found to be @xmath03% , near the instrumental value , thus confirming only that is not highly polarized at this wavelength .",
    "the high resolution total intensity image at 3.5 cm of the region around was made using all six available configurations ; it has a gaussian beam of hpbw @xmath02  ( see fig.[fig - snr3 cm ] ) .",
    "it shows reasonably uniform brightness distribution and the center  filled morphology characteristic of crab  type snrs .",
    "we note that the bright peak is resolved .",
    "it lies about @xmath12 ( 4pc at the 50kpc distance to the lmc ) to the northwest of the x ",
    "ray peak , which is presumably the location of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "also , the radio peak is not centered on the full snr which extends well to the south with dimensions of about @xmath13 or 30pc@xmath718pc .",
    "slices along the major axis of the remnant at a position angle of about 150@xmath14 show continuous emission throughout the total extent with a slight decrease near a declination of @xmath15 and then a rise again to the south .",
    "perhaps part of an outer shell may be forming around the plerion .",
    "the size given includes this outer emission .",
    "this is the most sensitive high  resolution radio image of this object now available , yet no direct evidence of the pulsar can be seen .",
    "this is not surprising , however , as 3.5 cm is a very short wavelength for pulsar emission which usually peaks at meter wavelengths .",
    "the pulsar has not been found at any radio wavelength .",
    "we found strong linear polarization in the direction towards the snr .",
    "the electric field vectors are superimposed on continuum contours in fig.[fig - pol3 cm ] .",
    "the mean fractional polarization is @xmath010% , calculated by dividing the polarized intensity image of the source by the total intensity image ( both made with field no.15 only ) .",
    "the total intensity values were truncated at the 3@xmath11 level which is @xmath05mjybeam@xmath16 before division , but all ( bias corrected ) polarized intensities within the source boundaries given by the total intensity cutoff were used . in the vector display , the vectors were truncated at the 3@xmath11 level .",
    "we note that a polarization map using seven mosaic positions looked similar but was noisier because of the few percent radial instrumental polarization toward from the surrounding fields .",
    "the electric vector alignment is fairly uniform but the polarized intensity is surprisingly patchy .",
    "the highest fractional polarization is 15.4% towards @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whereas at the position of the brightest total intensity @xmath19 and @xmath20 it is 5% , which is the lowest fractional polarization ( excluding blanked regions ) . at the position of the x ",
    "ray peak at @xmath21 and @xmath22 the polarized intensity is 7% .      the total intensity image of at 6 cm ( shown in fig.[fig - snr6 cm ] )",
    "was made using eight available configurations of the compact array ( see table[tbl - obs ] ) and also has the synthesized beam of hpbw @xmath02 .",
    "the fractional polarization towards ( calculated using only field no.15 ) is only @xmath03% , which is close to the noise level .",
    "we therefore detect no reliable polarization at 6 cm and conclude that there must be strong faraday depolarization between 3.5 and 6 cm .",
    "we note that at 6 cm the distribution of the closest antenna spacings represents lower spatial frequencies than those seen at 3.5 cm .",
    "if the polarization is all on a fine spatial scale we may find a lower value of the polarization at 6 cm .",
    "inspection of fig.[fig - pol3 cm ] , however , shows that while there is fine structure a significant part of the 3.5cm polarization is uniform on scales of over @xmath23 and so should appear at 6 cm .",
    "depolarization effects are obviously present .",
    "is very close to and it is also embedded in an region around the ob association @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the southern part of the snr is obscured and possibly interacts with the dark cloud within the region . with our high radio sensitivity we can see that the snr does extend well to the south of the bright northern component . with a size of 30pc@xmath718pc",
    ", it is the largest crab  type snr known .",
    "the feature at @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the elongated structure centered at about @xmath2 and @xmath26 might indicate the beginning of a transition into a composite remnant like snr 0540693 .",
    "the dense interstellar environment of the region may be conducive to the formation of a shell and the irregular structure of may be accounted for by a complex density distribution .",
    "@xcite found that contributes up to 80% of the flux density in this region at 0.843 ghz , the rest coming from the surrounding region .",
    "they suggested that the flat radio spectral index ( @xmath27 ) of @xmath10.1 ( @xmath28 ) indicated from earlier measurements @xcite should be characteristic of the snr itself .",
    "however , they also found that the optical emission lines from originate in conditions associated with blast waves and they therefore concluded that the corresponding non  thermal radio emission should not have the flat spectrum typically associated with pulsar stimulation .",
    "our results below differ somewhat from the previously published values derived from low resolution data but still show that n157b has a flat radio spectrum .",
    "data used for determining the radio spectrum of are listed in table [ tbl - spind ] . to obtain a consistent background and source extent , the images were all convolved to the @xmath29 resolution of the most image and the integrated flux density calculated over the same area in each convolved map .",
    "a background intensity around the source was determined from the average of several areas around the snr but far enough from 30 doradus to avoid contamination .",
    "0.843 & @xmath30 & anne green ( 1997 , private comunication ) + 1.400 & @xmath31 & data of @xcite + 2.378 & @xmath32 & data of @xcite + 4.740 & @xmath33 & data of this paper + 8.600 & @xmath34 & data of this paper +    the resultant integrated flux densities listed in table [ tbl - spind ] give a mean spectral index for of @xmath10.19 ( see fig.[fig - spind ] ) .",
    "brightness plots also show that the spectrum does not vary significantly across the whole extent of the snr .",
    "this argues that the entire snr is pulsar  powered .    in the x  ray band , however ,",
    "the spectrum of differs slightly relative to other such remnants .",
    "it has a power  law energy slope of @xmath11.5 which is steeper than those of other crab - like remnants with values of about @xmath11.0 @xcite .",
    "the x  ray and entire spectrum of also strikingly resemble that of snr 0540693 , leaving no doubt of the pleronic origin of .",
    "the snr 0540693 contains a pulsar and is a composite remnant , sharing the characteristics of pure shell remnants and pure plerions @xcite .",
    "this latter composite snr is often called a crab  type remnant , because the core is crab  like and the faint shell component was only investigated later .",
    "this further similarity between and 0540693 is more evidence that is beginning the transition to a composite remnant .",
    "the polarization properties of the region were previously investigated by @xcite at longer wavelengths .",
    "they used atca observations at 13 cm but concluded that no polarized emission was detected in any region of above the level of instrumental polarization ( less than 2% ) .",
    "we report a significant level of polarized emission at 3.5 cm from for the first time .",
    "this relatively high level of 10% is typical for a crab  type remnant .",
    "the data at 6 cm give a marginal detection which we consider an upper limit of 3% fractional polarization at the peak of .",
    "this low level of polarized emission at this wavelength implies very strong internal depolarization .",
    "the observed polarization could also be reduced by the thermal emission from the associated region around which may be intertwined with the snr so that its thermal electrons may cause some of the faraday depolarization as well .",
    "where @xmath36 is the fractional polarization at @xmath37 , the longer wavelength , and @xmath38 , the shorter wavelength ; @xmath39 is the rotation in position angle of the measured electric vector between the two wavelengths .",
    "we will adopt the possible detection of 3% polarization at 6 cm and so use a rough mean value for @xmath40 of 0.3 which requires an average rotation of 135@xmath14 . then using the standard formula for faraday rotation we can estimate the line  of  sight magnetic field strength :      where @xmath39 is in radians , @xmath42 is in meters , @xmath43 is the electron density in @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the magnetic field strength in gauss , and @xmath46 is the path length through the snr in pc . because the faraday rotation increases progressively along the path , we must actually find the adopted rotation along half the depth along the line of sight .",
    "we do not , of course , know this depth directly but choose its value to be approximately equal to the short observed axis of the snr or a half depth of 10pc . from an analysis of rosat and asca",
    "x  ray spectra , @xcite derived an electron density of @xmath47@xmath44 , where @xmath48 is the filling factor of the object .",
    "because crab  type snrs should be reasonably uniform inside , we adopt a value for @xmath48 of about 0.5 to get a mean density of about 2@xmath44 .",
    "these numbers give a line  of  sight magnetic field strength of 30@xmath49gauss .",
    "most crab  type snrs have rather uniform magnetic fields ; over the limited region where it can be observed , shows more variation than most .",
    "it may be that the field is directed mainly toward us , which would reduce the observed polarization at all wavelengths and also give a large faraday rotation .",
    "no correction has been made for an unknown field orientation which would tend to increase the field strength in the remnant .",
    "we should emphasize that this result is only an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "neglected factors include the uncertainties and probably variations in the depolarization , magnetic field reversals , density uncertainties and variations .",
    "for example , significant clumping can change the apparent integrated electron density because the x  ray emission depends upon the density squared but the faraday rotation depends linearly on the density and the sum of squares does not equal the square of sums .        where @xmath51 is the total energy in relativistic electrons , @xmath52 is the surface brightness of the remnant at a given observing frequncy @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 is its distance , and @xmath55 is a parameter that depends on the frequency , the spectral index and the adopted cutoff frequencies for the synchrotron radiation .",
    "there appears to be a break in the spectrum of the non  thermal emission between the radio and x ",
    "ray @xcite but we do not know specifically where it occurs .",
    "we shall choose an upper frequency of @xmath56hz and a lower one of @xmath57hz , with a spectral index of @xmath10.19 , @xmath58 at 8.6ghz where the flux density is 1.82jy .",
    "with the sizes and magnetic field strength given above , we find that the mean relativistic electron energy density is @xmath59ergs@xmath44 .",
    "this is about 10 times the magnetic energy density .",
    "while within the errors , we can not definitely state that the values are different .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the three objects for which we have now measured the relative energies by this method , each has between 3 and 10 times greater relativistic electron energy than magnetic energy ( kepler s snr @xcite and n23 snr @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite give an approximate temperature for the thermal gas in of 0.4  0.7kev .",
    "choosing 0.6kev and the approximate density of 2@xmath44 used above , the thermal energy density is about @xmath60erg@xmath44 .",
    "thus the thermal energy is about 10 times that in relativistic electrons and 100 times that in the magnetic field . even in this crab  type snr",
    "the thermal energy dominates .    in summary ,",
    "the filled structure and uniform spectral index of are crab  like but it also has some characteristics similar to those of the composite snr 0540693 . although the dense , irregular surroundings may be partly responsible for the non  uniform brightness and outline of this snr particularly to the south , the overall morphology and spectral index suggest that this snr is just beginning the transition from a pure crab  like remnant to a composite remnant",
    ". it will be interesting to see how it changes at radio , optical and x  ray wavelengths in the future .",
    "we have detected for the first time a significant level of linearly polarized emission in this object at 3.5 cm wavelength .",
    "the encompassing h ii region and clumpy internal structure within the snr may cause sufficient faraday rotation to reduce the polarization to below detectable levels at 6 cm and make the large variations in the polarization observed at 3.5 cm at different positions around the remnant .",
    "observations at higher frequencies , e.g. 23ghz , are needed to enable more accurate determination of the faraday rotation .",
