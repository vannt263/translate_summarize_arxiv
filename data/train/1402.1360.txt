    "irreversibility characterises everyday life and is closely connected to the disappearance of quantum mechanical features in macroscopic objects .",
    "microscopic descriptions of noise and dissipation usually start from a fully quantum mechanical model and have been discussed over the years in several seminal works @xcite .",
    "recently , several studies have focused on thermalization in closed quantum systems @xcite paying particular attention to the dynamics of many - body systems where thermalization does not occur @xcite .        in this manuscript",
    "we consider a specific closed many - body system , which consists of a chain of ions in a linear paul trap that couple via the repulsive coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "two impurity defects , here two ions of larger mass , are placed within the chain as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , and couple with one another via the axial vibrations of the ion chain . in our model",
    "the displacement of an ion from its equilibrium position is described by quadratic terms in the expansion of the coulomb potential . in this regime",
    "the dynamics are integrable and recurrences are observed on time scales determined by the finite system size . however , since the coupling between the axial and transversal vibrations is a tunable parameter , the time scales between the appearance of ( quasi ) thermalization and recurrence are well separated and as a result the chain effectively acts as a thermal reservoir for each component .",
    "this behaviour agrees with the predictions of previous works , which studied thermalization of a component of a harmonic chain with nearest - neighbour interactions @xcite .    in the precursors of this work we have shown that the vibrational modes of a chain can also mediate entanglement between two impurity defects embedded in the chain",
    "this entanglement is protected by spatial symmetries of the chain , it is robust against variations in the chain size and can survive for times of the order of the recurrence time @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also found in a chain of ions interacting with the couloumb long - range repulsion , assuming that the ions were uniformly spaced .",
    "even if it exhibits several analogies , the entanglement dynamics found here can not be put in direct connection with the ones in a chain with nearest - neighbour coupling . moreover , typically the ion chain is realised in linear paul traps , which impose a non - uniform density distribution : bloch theorem does not apply . finally , the dynamics discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite are strictly valid for chains of hundreds of ions : only in this limit is the recurrence time sufficiently long so that entanglement is a ( quasi ) stationary feature . in experiments , however , the number of particles is typically of several tens to a maximum of a hundred , it is thus legitimate to ask whether such dynamics could be observed .",
    "the purpose of this work is to address these open questions : it elucidates what is the underlying mechanism which generates entanglement between two heavy impurity defects in an ion chain , it presents a systematic study of the parameter regimes under which entanglement is found , and identifies its feature in chains of tens of ions , which are at the borderline of the validity of the theory discussed in @xcite .",

    "the above model is a generalization of models previously discussed by rubin  @xcite and ullerma  @xcite .",
    "they showed that a chain , which is initially prepared in a thermal state , can act as a thermal bath for a single defect under conditions which involve the mass ratio @xmath29 , the strength of the coupling , and the time scales over which the dynamics are analyzed . in the following",
    "we will discuss how this effect is modified in the presence of two defects .",
    "for this purpose it is convenient to recast the hamiltonian in a coordinate system which highlights the symmetry properties of the dynamics .",
    "let us introduce centre of mass ( com ) and relative coordinates for the defect and chain particles as @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates even or odd parity under mirror reflection about the chain centre , @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding canonically conjugate momenta are @xmath33 for the defects and @xmath34 for the chain oscillators . with this representation , and assuming that the defects are within the bulk of the chain and finite - size effects can be neglected , the hamiltonian   can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 \\\\ & & + \\sum_{j_\\pm=0}^{a-1}\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(x_{j,\\pm}-x_{j+1,\\pm})^2+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}x_{n,\\pm}^2\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ h_{s,\\pm}&=&\\frac{p^2_\\pm}{2 m } + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_\\gamma^ 2 x^2_\\pm \\label{eq : hspm}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 is a shifted trap frequency and by definition @xmath39 , while @xmath40 .",
    "one can note that the hamiltonian terms are either symmetric ( even parity ) or antisymmetric ( odd parity ) and the sets of symmetric and antisymmetric coordinates therefore form two separate , uncoupled systems .",
    "if both defects couple to the same chain particle , i.e. @xmath41 , the above equations show that only the defect com coordinate couples to the symmetric coordinates of the chain , while the defect relative motion is perfectly decoupled and thus it is an eigenmode of the whole system at frequency @xmath42 . therefore , under the conditions for which the chain acts as thermal bath for a single defect , it will induce thermalization of the com mode of the defect particle and possible initial correlations between it and the relative motion of the defects are washed out . after a transient time the relative motion of the defects will therefore be in a state that is solely determined by the initially prepared state , while the com will be in a thermal state at temperature @xmath43 .",
    "this dynamic is the key element for entanglement generation between the oscillators .",
    "for instance , it can be shown that , if the relative motion is in a squeezed state and the temperature of the com is sufficiently low , the product of the two orthogonal quadratures @xmath44 ( here taken in the reference frame rotating at the oscillator frequency @xmath45 ) , can be below the standard quantum limit so that the two defects are two - mode squeezed , and thus entangled @xcite .",
    "the squeezing of the relative motion can result from preparing each individual defect oscillator in a squeezed state at time @xmath25 .",
    "this situation has been extensively analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is based on the existence of spatially - localized eigenmodes , which can be considered a realization of decoherence - free subspaces @xcite .     of the two defects",
    "are shown , which couple to two different reservoirs given by the coordinates @xmath46 . ]    in the following we consider the situation in which the two oscillators are at a finite distance @xmath47 for @xmath1 even and @xmath48 for @xmath1 odd .",
    "this scenario is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comrel ] where the com and relative coordinates of the defects couple to two separate environments , composed of the chain of symmetric and antisymmetric displacements , respectively .",
    "for @xmath49 , when the impurity defects couple to different chain particles , there exists no eigenmode of the chain which solely involves displacements of the impurity defects .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of the impurity defects breaks the discrete translational invariance of the chain , and gives rise to localized modes which under certain conditions can be eigenmodes of the chain .",
    "this can be verified by analysing the structure of the equations of motion .",
    "consider for instance the equation of motion of oscillator @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "it is simple to show that one can construct a mode @xmath53 , which is a superposition of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and which is orthogonal to @xmath56 in the riemannian space with metric tensor @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal corresponds to @xmath58 for the array @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "one can construct @xmath60 such modes .",
    "however , only one specific mode @xmath61 can be an eigenmode of the dynamics .",
    "this happens when the frequency of the defect oscillator , @xmath45 , matches a specific value @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "for instance , when @xmath63 one finds the localized mode @xmath64 , which is an eigenmode of the composite dynamics when @xmath65 .",
    "analogous considerations can be made for the relative motion .",
    "having identified the localized modes , then the generation of entanglement between the two defect oscillators follows a similar route as the one described when the defects couple to the same chain particle .",
    "there are however two important differences .",
    "first , the projection of the defect oscillators into the decoupled mode is now smaller and therefore the initial squeezing only partly determines the variance of each composite quadrature .",
    "moreover , the variance of each composite quadrature is also determined by the initial temperature of the chain , since there is a finite projection of the chain thermal state onto the decoupled mode ( through the interposed chain oscillators ) .",
    "this limits the amount of entanglement one can reach when the oscillators are at a finite distance . in sec . [",
    "sec : dist_dependence ] we will provide results for specific parameters .      the stationary properties of the system above have been analysed in @xcite , and shown to be independent of the chain size and therefore applicable to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the reason is that the localized modes involve just the defect oscillators and the interposed chain particles , and do not depend on the length of the chain as long as finite - size effects can be neglected .",
    "entanglement in a chain of _ identical _ oscillators has also been investigated and in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors characterized the entanglement between two components at steady state .",
    "studies on dynamical effects have highlighted the existence of entanglement between the ions at the chain edges @xcite , however this is not a stationary effect , as it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit for infinitely long chains .",
    "entanglement generation between two physical systems , such as spins or oscillators , has also been discussed by modeling the bath using the born - markov master equation in quantum - optical systems @xcite , or by resorting to phenomenological models , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . in our model",
    ", one could consider to derive a master equation describing the dynamics of the two defects . due to the presence of the localized mode , the bath of oscillators we consider is non - markovian",
    ". a possible approach is to identify the localized eigenmode as a pseudomode coupling with the defects and thus analyze the dynamics using methods developed in ref .",
    "it is further interesting to consider measures of non - markovianity for our system , as the ones proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied in similar settings in ref . @xcite .",
    "we now turn to investigate entanglement generation between two impurity defects embedded in a chain of trapped ions . with respect to the previous simplified model",
    ", the particles now interact via the long - range coulomb repulsion .",
    "moreover , they are generally confined in external potentials , which make the ions density inhomogeneous .",
    "a simple picture in terms of localized modes does not strictly apply , nevertheless we show that this model already provides a useful guidance to understand the dynamics in an ion chain , even for a small number ( ten ) of ions .",
    "before we start , let us comment on previous work . in ref .",
    "@xcite entanglement transfer between the transverse modes of the ions was analysed . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that stationary entanglement between two ions at opposite edges of a cluster composed of three aligned ions can be created . in this latter work",
    "the thermal bath was effectively provided by continuous sympathetic cooling of the central ion , and the effective energy transfer into the modes of the electromagnetic field gave rise to a dynamics analogous to thermalization . in the current work , instead , the bath is microscopically modeled by the lighter ions of the chain and this is what we discuss in the present section .",
    "we consider @xmath1 ions with equal charge @xmath66 , which are confined in a linear paul trap at positions @xmath67 .",
    "the trap secular potential reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 determine the strength of the axial and transverse potentials .",
    "the latter is generated by a radio - frequency trap and depends on the ion mass @xmath71 via the relation @xmath72 here , @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the radio - field frequency and @xmath75 a constant depending on the trap geometry @xcite .",
    "ions of different mass therefore experience different transverse trapping frequencies , and this mass dependence will be key for the desired dynamics .    when the ions are laser - cooled , they crystallize at the equilibrium positions of the total potential given by @xmath76 and the mutual coulomb repulsion @xmath77    here we choose the trap aspect ratio @xmath78 to be sufficiently large , so that the ions crystallize along the @xmath79 axis at the equilibrium positions @xmath80 , which are the solutions to @xmath81 note that in the longitudinal direction none of the parameters depend on the ions mass and that the resulting interparticle distance at equilibrium is not uniform @xcite . therefore , to ensure that the hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to mirror reflection about the chain centre , which is a prerequisite for the existence of localized eigenmodes involving the defects oscillations , the defect modes have to be placed symmetrically with respect to the chain centre @xcite . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dist](a ) we show how the distance between pairs of defect ions scales as a function of the number of interposed ions . while for a large system a certain robustness with respect to the exact positioning of the defects can be expected , in a small system the defects have to be precisely located .",
    "this requirement is relaxed in settings in which the ions are axially equidistantly spaced , for example in a chain of ions at the central axis of a three dimensional crystal @xcite or when the ions are confined by means of anharmonic potentials @xcite .",
    "we now assume that the chain has been prepared at a temperature @xmath43 such that the ions carry out harmonic oscillations around their equilibrium positions @xmath82 .",
    "the potential can hence be described by its harmonic approximation , and under this condition , axial and transverse dynamics decouple .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath83 with    @xmath84    here @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the @xmath87 components of the momentum @xmath88 of ion @xmath89 .",
    "the components of the axial and transverse potentials read , respectively , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the kronecker delta , while @xmath92 are the couplings due to the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian term @xmath93 is found from @xmath94 by replacing @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist](b ) we show the eigenfrequency spectrum for a chain composed of @xmath96 ca@xmath97 ions , into which two in@xmath97 ions are embedded such that @xmath98 calcium ions are interposed .",
    "this system has a mass ratio of @xmath99 @xcite and in order to be able to easily compare results for chains of different length we rescale @xmath100 so that @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 khz is a reference axial trap frequency , which we have chosen such that the interparticle distance at the centre of the chain is constant for all @xmath1 and therefore the dispersion relation remains invariant as @xmath1 is varied .",
    "the spectrum consists of two degenerate normal frequencies of the transverse modes ( tm ) , which appear separate from the continuum ( four isolated frequencies in total , two for each transverse spectra ) .",
    "they correspond to normal modes localized around the position of the two defects and occur due to the mass dependence of the transverse , radio - frequency potential . by varying the mass ratio @xmath103 or the trap aspect ratio @xmath104 , these localized frequencies can be tuned and for large enough separation of the continuum part from the tm spectrum , the dynamics of these two modes decouple from the rest of the transverse chain .",
    "the largest amplitudes are observed at the position of the defect ions and their first neighbours ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eigenmode_imp ] ) , while all other ions are essentially unaffected .",
    "we note that these degenerate modes are either symmetric or anti - symmetric with respect to reflection about the chain centre .    in order to realize a dynamics analogous to the one sketched in the previous section , we need to introduce a coupling between the transverse defect modes and the axial ones .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of the radial defect modes needs to fall into the same range as the band of the axial excitations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dist](b ) ) . the second condition can be easily achieved by appropriately choosing the mass ratio and the trap confinement . moreover , while anharmonicities ( i.e. , higher order terms of the taylor expansion of the coulomb interaction ) can give rise to a non - negligible coupling between the radial defect vibration and the axial vibrations , for sufficiently cold atoms these only become important over time scales longer than the revival time of the gaussian dynamics . a coupling like the one given in eq .",
    ", however , can originate from the interaction with a standing - wave laser field in the @xmath105 plane , which is switched on at time @xmath25 and dispersively couples with an internal transition of the impurity defect ions .",
    "when the node of the laser standing wave coincides with the equilibrium positions of the defect ions , the chain dynamics in the lamb - dicke regime @xcite is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath106 where @xmath107\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath108 being an effective coupling strength and @xmath109 the heaviside function .",
    "this local coupling allows an excitation in the defects tms to also excite their axial degree of freedom , which in turn generates a phononic excitation in the axial direction .",
    "note that the dynamics in the @xmath110-direction is decoupled and therefore ignored in the following .      with this picture in mind , our goal will be to entangle the two defects tms through their interaction with a reservoir provided by the axial phonons .",
    "the initial states of the axial modes of the chain are prepared by doppler cooling , so that the density matrix for the axial oscillators reads @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath43 is the temperature characterising the dynamical steady state obtained by laser cooling @xcite , @xmath113 is the reservoir hamiltonian and @xmath114 $ ] its partition function .",
    "the tms of the defect are initially prepared in the ground state of the transverse oscillator through sideband cooling @xcite and then converted into squeezed pure states @xcite , described by the density matrix @xmath115 , with a real - valued squeezing parameter @xmath116 and variances @xmath117 , @xmath118 . here @xmath119 is the size of the defect ground state in the transverse direction with frequency @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the associated momentum @xcite .",

    "the resulting entanglement dynamics , as shown by the grey line in figure  [ fig : e_n_gamma_zero](a ) for a chain of @xmath183 , demonstrates that the presence of the transverse environment therefore adds small amplitude oscillations to the unitary entanglement evolution and also tends to decrease its magnitude .",
    "let us now assume that at @xmath25 the coupling between the defects transverse oscillations with the axial modes is switched on .",
    "this leads to a rapid growth of the quantum correlations between the defect ions and the corresponding logarithmic negativity ( see black line in figure  [ fig : e_n_gamma_zero](a ) ) and an increase almost tenfold with respect to the value obtained using direct coulomb coupling only .",
    "we note that this kind of dynamics can be observed for any distance larger than @xmath184 .",
    "it is insightful to compare the results obtained above , which were calculated assuming that the ions form a chain in a linear paul trap , with the ones found when the ions are assumed to be equally spaced in the axial direction @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic negativities for both cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_n_gamma_zero](b ) and one can clearly see that the average steady - state entanglement created is comparable , even though slightly reduced in the linear paul trap setting . however , the revival time @xmath169 , at which finite - size effects start to play a role , is doubled in the paul trap , which can be understood by realising that the inter - particle distance at the chain center in the trap is equal to the inter - particle distance in the case of equidistant ions .",
    "the increased inter - particle distance far from the chain centre in a harmonic trap suggests that the shorter wavelength modes are localized at the chain center , while the overlap with modes that oscillate away from the centre , is smaller than in the case of a uniform chain .",
    "this explains the longer revival time .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_n_gamma_zero](c ) we show the behaviour of the logarithmic negativity for increasing particle number .",
    "one can clearly see that the ( quasi ) steady state value reached does not change as @xmath1 becomes larger , which allows to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit and the entanglement reached between two defects embedded in a macroscopic bulk .",
    "while the large numbers of ions considered in this plot are so far difficult to achieve in linear - paul traps , this result shows that entanglement could be observed at equilibrium in a solid - state environment , provided that spatially - localized normal modes involving the defects characterize the dynamics of the bulk .",
    "the results shown so far demonstrate that entanglement can be efficiently generated in the system described above .",
    "two important prerequisites are that the defects are initially prepared in a squeezed state and that the chain is sufficiently cold when the defects are at a distance @xmath185 .",
    "let us first examine the dependence on the initial squeezing and assume the chain to be at a sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the dependence of bath - mediated entanglement on the initial squeezing of the entangled objects was already pointed out and discussed in various settings @xcite .",
    "it can be understood in terms of non - unitary beam splitter dynamics , in which the degrees of freedom of two non - classical input states ( which can be separable ) mix and thereby generate quantum correlations . when both defects couple to the same position in the chain , a larger value of the initial squeezing leads to larger entanglement . in our model",
    "the squeezing of the defects state at @xmath186 is the result of the combined action of ( i ) the initial state preparation ( whose squeezing parameter is given by @xmath116 ) and ( ii ) of the quench performed at @xmath25 by switching on the laser ( which also gives rise to a sudden quench of the defect potentials ) .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : entmap](a ) we display the average logarithmic negativity , @xmath173 , as a function of the initial squeezing parameter @xmath116 and for chains of different sizes , assuming the inter - particle distance to be uniform .",
    "this ensures that the defects are at the same distance regardless of how many ions are in the chain , allowing for easier comparison of the effect of the chain size on the average entanglement .",
    "we first note that the curves all vanish at the same value of @xmath187 , where the initial squeezing of the defects and the one due to the quench mutually cancel .",
    "this effect was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . at either side of this point",
    "@xmath173 reaches a maximum and then starts to decrease .",
    "this decrease is more pronounced for smaller sizes , and is due to the fact that for the considered parameters the initial energy of the defect oscillators , @xmath188 , is comparable to the thermal energy of the rest of the chain , @xmath189 , with @xmath190 .",
    "this excess energy causes the second moments of the impurity to undergo large amplitude oscillations which results in large amplitude oscillations of the logarithmic negativity . to avoid this scenario",
    "one can place a constraint on the allowed initial squeezing of the defects as @xmath191 in fig .",
    "[ fig : entmap](b ) the scaled energy of the squeezed states ( solid lines ) is seen to exceed the scaled energy of the chain ( dashed line ) for @xmath192 . for larger chains",
    "the effect of the large squeezing is reduced and one can infer that it becomes negligible in the thermodynamic limit .    the dependence on the initial temperature is intimately related to the distance @xmath193 between the defects , and we will discuss this dependence in the following .      to determine the scaling of entanglement as a function of @xmath193 , we numerically determine the logarithmic negativity at the quasi - steady state for a large chain of @xmath183 ions in which the relative motion of the defects contributes to the oscillations of a localized eigenmode ( thus , the frequency of the defect oscillators coincide with a value @xmath194 at which the spectral density @xmath195 ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_dependence](a ) that an entangled ( quasi ) steady state is reached for the cases of @xmath196 ( blue ) , @xmath98 ( green ) and @xmath197 ( red curve ) and for @xmath198 , so that @xmath199 . however , the time at which it is established varies .",
    "the mean value @xmath173 of the entanglement over the ( quasi-)steady state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_dependence](b ) and can be seen to vary with @xmath193 .",
    "different colours correspond to different zeros of @xmath200 and show that entanglement production can be optimised by proper choice of the roots of the spectral density , @xmath201 , to which the defects frequency is tuned .",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath202 as a function of the distance @xmath193 between the impurity defects is indicated by the solid black line .",
    "note that for the chosen parameters , no entanglement is present in the steady - state for the first node @xmath203 , while for any given distance it increases with @xmath202 .",
    "on the other hand , the time necessary for reaching the steady state also grows with @xmath202 , hence for localized normal modes with a large eigenfrequency @xmath194 , the dynamics of entanglement may not exhibit separation of time scales : finite - size effects become evident before a constant value of the entanglement negativity has been reached .",
    "this is not necessarily bad .",
    "in fact , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite and as we discuss in the next section , finite - size effects can increase the amount of entanglement between the defects , even though for a comparatively shorter interval of time .",
    "therefore , assuming that one can optimize the dynamics by tuning the frequencies of the defect oscillators such that they match the optimal localized normal mode , the dependence of the asymptotic value of entanglement on the distance seems to follow a power law behaviour .",
    "this can be verified using the model of coupled oscillators with nearest - neigbour interaction , which is discussed extensively in refs . @xcite and summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : micromodel ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distancedependencetzero ] we show the behaviour of entanglement as a function of the distance when ( a ) the com motion and ( b ) the relative motion of the defects participate in a localized eigenmode .",
    "the values of @xmath202 correspond to the roots @xmath204 at which the corresponding spectral density vanishes , such that @xmath205 .",
    "comparison with the result using the coulomb interaction demonstrates that the power law decay is found for both the long - range ( coulomb ) and the short - range interacting models .",
    "it is thus a feature related to the properties of the localized normal modes and their coupling with the rest of the chain .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with previous studies on bath mediated entanglement in linear chains of oscillators .",
    "there , it was shown that entanglement decays quickly on the length scale of the order of the interparticle distance @xcite .",
    "these works , however , considered chains which possess discrete translational symmetry , while in our case the presence of the defect ions gives rise to a set of localized normal modes involving the defects and the ions between them .",
    "these modes are the key elements at the basis of the creation of the decoherence - free subspace which allows for entanglement creation , and show that the dynamics of this entanglement generation is intrinsically related with the lattice symmetries .     for @xmath175 , with the distance @xmath193 for a chain of coupled oscillators with nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "subplot ( a ) shows the behaviour for the decoupled collective mode of the com ( a ) and ( b ) for the relative motion .",
    "the decoupling is achieved with the help of the @xmath202-th zero of the spectral density @xmath159 ( a ) and @xmath160 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the parameters chosen are @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , see sec .",
    "[ micromodel ] .",
    "the initial temperature is @xmath209 and the squeezing is @xmath210 . ]",
    "further calculations show that the entanglement decay with distance is faster with increasing temperature .",
    "in fact , the temperature also determines the variances of the chain oscillators which participate in the localized normal mode , and which are easily identified ( in the oscillator chain with nearest - neighbour interactions ) as the oscillators interposed between the two defects .",
    "the larger the distance between the defects , the larger the number of these oscillators and therefore the more significant the effect of the chain s temperature , which results from the initial squeezing of the defects and the thermal excitation of the interposed oscillators . already at @xmath211 , the initial variance of the localized modes",
    "is pushed close to the standard quantum limit for large distances .",
    "in addition , a number of eigenmodes , which are thermally occupied , have a finite overlap with the defect oscillators and contribute to the variance of both relative and center - of - mass oscillators , thus diminishing the resulting entanglement .",
    "we now turn to systems which have been realized in experimental setups consisting of tens of ions forming a chain in a linear paul trap .",
    "in particular we consider a chain of @xmath212 ions at finite temperatures , in which two defects are embedded at a distance @xmath213 and , in the second case , @xmath214 from each other ( i.e. four and six ions , respectively , are interposed ) . for systems of this size ,",
    "finite - size effects become relevant on short time scales , which can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : e_n_n50 ] , where we show the dynamics of the logarithmic negativity for a time scale of the order of the revival time : the average value of entanglement either monotonously increases or decreases and no ( quasi ) steady - state is reached . in both cases ,",
    "the coupling with the axial modes gives rise to a tenfold increase of the logarithmic negativity at each instant of time ( after a finite transient ) , when compared to the value due to the direct coulomb coupling within the transverse chain .    for chains consisting of @xmath215 ions one can also take advantage of the finite - size effect to generate entanglement .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entn10 ] for @xmath216 and @xmath213 for two different temperatures . for comparison the case of zero laser coupling is shown as grey and black lines for the same temperatures .",
    "the oscillatory nature of @xmath172 is clearly visible when the com motion is decoupled ( figs .",
    "[ fig : entn10 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , but is less evident when the relative motion is decoupled ( figure  [ fig : entn10](c ) ) .",
    "the coupling with the axial modes changes the frequency of the oscillations of @xmath172 and gives rise to a dynamics similar to the beam - splitter coupling generated by the direct interaction , as can be seen by comparing the curves obtained with and without the coupling laser .",
    "the quantum states of a single oscillator can be measured by means of an ancillary qubit @xcite , which in the case of an ion chain can be the electronic spin of the ions .",
    "the measured statistics of the spin operators then gives direct information of the oscillators quasi - probability functions .",
    "measurements of the bath non - markovianity have been proposed by means of two qubits @xcite , and specific realizations for ion chains have been discussed .",
    "entanglement measurements , however , present an additional challenge as they are not accessible from single ion statistics and require correlated measurements on the system . several methods , however , have been developed in recent years @xcite and here we present a method which extends the single - oscillator state determination introduced in @xcite .    to determine the state of the transverse modes of the two defects we assume that one can locally couple spin and motional degrees of freedom of each defect ion by implementing the interaction hamiltonian @xmath217 where @xmath218 labels the defect ions , @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the transverse mode @xmath218 with frequency @xmath221 and @xmath222 the pauli operators acting on the @xmath218-th spin . setting the initial spin state of each ion to be an eigenstate of the @xmath223 operator with eigenvalue @xmath224 , one can check that , by measuring the expectation value of the correlated spins operators @xmath225 one obtains a measurement of the characteristic function @xmath75 , which reads @xmath226\\\\ & = 4\\langle t \\rangle(t)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath227 is the density matrix of the two transverse oscillators at time @xmath228 , @xmath229 are displacement operators acting on the defects tm , and @xmath230 access to the entire phase space and , consequently , full reconstruction of the oscillators state and its entanglement properties is thus possible by properly designed coupling profiles .",
    "for the dynamics of the defect ions , which are gaussian states and therefore fully described by their low - order moments , it is sufficient to probe their characteristic function close to the phase - space origin .",
    "we remark that this scheme demands neither interaction of the distant systems to a common ancilla @xcite , nor prior displacement operations on the oscillator states @xcite .",
    "we have theoretically analysed the generation of entanglement between two impurity defects embedded in an ion chain in a linear paul trap . in this work",
    "we have shown that parameter regimes exist for which entanglement can be maintained over large time intervals , with values oscillating around a finite mean - value .",
    "the predicted entanglement is robust against fluctuations in the system parameters , such as the size and the elapsed time , as long as finite size effects can be neglected .",
    "this therefore suggests that entanglement can be encountered in macroscopic bulk systems as well .",
    "while the explored regimes include cases which are out of reach for current experiments with trapped ions , the entangling dynamics analysed here can be encountered in other physical platforms as well , for example optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients required are the presence of non - local , decoherence - free subspaces ( zeroes of the spectral densities ) which partially protect the initial information .",
    "in addition , the ability to tune the frequencies of the defects to an appropriate zero of the spectral density is required .    beyond possible applications for quantum technologies",
    ", this analysis highlights the conditions for identifying quantum mechanical features in mesoscopic bulks .",
    "important conditions we have identified are the capability to cool the bulk to a very low temperature , which needs to be smaller than the defect frequency , and the ability to tune the defect oscillator frequency to a specific localized normal mode of the bulk .",
    "this latter condition requires first a spatial homogeneity of the bulk over the distance between the two defects as well as the possibility to spectrally resolve the individual localized modes eigenfrequencies .",
    "these conditions become obviously more and more demanding as the distance is increased , since the frequency distribution of localized eigenmodes becomes denser and denser within the band . however , this issue could be overcome by applying local time - dependent operations @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that , while the dynamics we have considered here is fully gaussian , it would be interesting to include non - gaussian elements , such as nonlinearities and initially non - gaussian states , as these may alter the amount of quantum correlations between the defects @xcite .",
    "further analysis may also include the effect of the chain close to a structural instability , such as the zigzag transition @xcite . here",
