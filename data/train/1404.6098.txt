    "@xmath87 is found to be almost independent of the island thickness .",
    "even the thinnest films have a well - pronounced surface state , which is in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the 1@xmath12 sample generation always exhibits a very narrow surface state peak with a maximum at @xmath158  mv and a width given by @xmath159  mev , corresponding to a lifetime of @xmath160  fs . in a previous analysis of the width of the experimental surface state peak , which even considered energy - dependent lifetime broadening , a value of @xmath161  mev",
    "was reported @xcite . in comparison with the result reported here for the 1@xmath12 sample generation",
    ", this implies that no additional energy broadening arises due to impurity - induced scattering .",
    "it is therefore assumed that the defect - induced broadening for this very clean sample generation can be completely neglected , and hence @xmath162 is the `` intrinsic '' lifetime broadening . in summary , this shows that la(0001 ) surfaces of the 1@xmath12 sample generation are of the same or even better quality compared to previous studies @xcite .",
    "the sts spectra taken on the la islands of the 2@xmath13 sample generation exhibit surface state peaks with a reduced intensity and a larger width [ fig .",
    "[ fig : s1](b - d ) ] .",
    "therefore , the modified @xmath163 must be affected by a defect - induced contribution @xmath164 .",
    "this quantity is about twice as large as the `` intrinsic '' broadening @xmath87 .",
    "the influence of surface contamination on superconductivity is analyzed in the main part of the paper .",

    "<S> the thickness dependence of the superconducting energy gap @xmath0 of double hexagonally close packed ( dhcp ) lanthanum islands grown on w(110 ) is studied by scanning tunneling spectroscopy , from the bulk to the thin film limit . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity is suppressed by the boundary conditions for the superconducting wavefunction at the surface and w / la interface , leading to a linear decrease of the critical temperature @xmath1 as a function of the inverse film thickness . for thick , bulk - like films , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 and @xmath1 are 40% larger as compared to literature values of dhcp la measured by other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is reconciled by examining the effects of surface contamination as probed by modifications of the surface state , suggesting that the large @xmath1 originates in the superior purity of the samples investigated here .    </S>",
