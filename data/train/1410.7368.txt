    "atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma)@xcite has recently become the world s largest millimeter-/submillimeter - wave ( mm-/submm - wave ) interferometer , and currently commissioning and early science observations are ongoing in parallel .",
    "one of the most important commissioning items before the full science operation of alma is the commissioning of long baselines .",
    "the difficulty of long baseline interferometry in mm-/submm - wave comes mainly from the large phase fluctuation caused by water vapor in the atmosphere .",
    "refraction of water vapor causes the change of phase ( and amplitude ) of electromagnetic wave .",
    "water vapor is believed to be distributed as clumps that have a power - law size distribution and an upper limit of size at some point .",
    "the difference of path lengths through water vapor clumps in the line - of - sight between two antennas causes a phase difference , and the change of this difference caused by the flow of water vapor clumps creates phase fluctuation . due to the power - law size distribution and the upper limit of the size of the water vapor clumps ,",
    "the phase fluctuation is expected to increase with baseline length , and at some point , phase fluctuation does not become larger any more ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "this phase fluctuation can be reduced using the 183  ghz water vapor radiometer ( wvr)@xcite .",
    "wvrs are installed in each of the 12-m diameter alma antennas , and they measure the line - of - sight atmospheric water vapor content precisely .",
    "the difference of the water vapor content between antennas corresponds to the difference of path lengths due to the water vapor clumps , and therefore it is possible to estimate the phase difference between antennas .",
    "correcting this estimated phase difference will correct the phase fluctuation caused by water vapor in the atmosphere .",
    "this phase correction method using wvrs has been shown to work successfully on the past shorter baseline alma data@xcite .",
    "for the commissioning of alma long baseline , it is important to know how large the phase fluctuation can be as a function of baseline length , at which baseline length the phase fluctuation turns over ( i.e. , stops increasing ) , and whether the wvr phase correction works well even at the long baseline . in this paper , we discuss these topics .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for bands 6 and 7 , the average coherence time is 108 and 57 seconds , respectively , for the raw data and @xmath1 and 125 seconds for the wvr corrected data .",
    "this tells that for these higher frequency observations , especially for band 7 ( or higher frequency bands ) , it is better to observe with fast switching calibration technique to keep coherence loss less than 10% .",
    "this results do not reject to observe slow switching observation , but the data taken with the slow switching will have some degree ( more than 10% ) of coherence loss .    it is obvious that the wvr phase correction extends the coherence time significantly ( more than a factor of 2 ) from the non - wvr corrected data .",
    "this also suggests that the wvr phase correction helps a lot for vlbi observations .",
    "but still it is better to operate with fast switching calibration , especially for higher frequency bands ( higher than band 7 ) to have low coherence loss data .",

    "<S> we present the phase characteristics study of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) long ( up to 3  km ) baseline , which is the longest baseline tested so far using alma . </S>",
    "<S> the data consist of long time - scale ( 10  20 minutes ) measurements on a strong point source ( i.e. , bright quasar ) at various frequency bands ( bands 3 , 6 , and 7 , which correspond to the frequencies of about 88 ghz , 232 ghz , and 336 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> water vapor radiometer ( wvr ) phase correction works well even at long baselines , and the efficiency is better at higher pwv ( @xmath0  mm ) condition , consistent with the past studies . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the spatial structure function of phase fluctuation , and display that the phase fluctuation ( i.e. , rms phase ) increases as a function of baseline length , and some data sets show turn - over around several hundred meters to 1  km and being almost constant at longer baselines . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first millimeter / submillimeter structure function at this long baseline length , and to show the turn - over of the structure function . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observation of the turn - over indicates that even if the alma baseline length extends to the planned longest baseline of 15  km , fringes will be detected at a similar rms phase fluctuation as that at a few km baseline lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the coherence time using the 3 km baseline data , and the results indicate that the coherence time for band 3 is longer than 400 seconds in most of the data ( both in the raw and wvr - corrected data ) . for bands 6 and 7 , </S>",
    "<S> wvr - corrected data have about twice longer coherence time , but it is better to use fast switching method to avoid the coherence loss . </S>"
