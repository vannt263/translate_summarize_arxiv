    "3 . identifying hit fibers  : :    a hit fiber is identified by requiring at least one or two hit pixels    of cluster within the fiber . the hit fiber position in the ccd    coordinate is determined from a mapping table that is obtained from    the el calibration .",
    "4 . making hit fiber clusters  : :    a fiber cluster is determined by a group of neighboring hit fibers .",
    "we apply two kinds of filtering algorithms to the fiber clusters to improve the signal - to - noise ratio :    @xmath4  : :    we require that a fiber cluster should consist of hit fibers in both    upper and lower layers of a fiber sheet .",
    "this eliminates fiber    clusters of small pixel images which come from dark current in an iit . @xmath4",
    ": :    when a big pixel cluster lies on the adjacent fiber sheets in a bundle    and makes multiple fiber clusters , we choose only fiber clusters    containing peak of adc brightness .",
    "this removes fake fiber - clusters    introduced by the dense arrangement of fiber sheets in a bundle .",
    "we consider a fiber cluster passing through these two filters as a scifi `` hit '' .",
    "every hit position in the ccd coordinate is then converted into the position in the detector coordinates ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) .",
    "the hit position is defined as the centroid of a fiber cluster , weighted by the adc value of the hit pixel .      a found hit gives the number of pixels for the parent pixel cluster , @xmath7 . led calibration data show that @xmath7 has good linearity with respect to the number of photons injected to iit .",
    "since the intensity of observed light is proportional to the energy loss in the fiber , @xmath7 is expected to be a good estimator of the energy of the parent particle .",
    "[ fig : ii10npix ] shows an @xmath7 distribution for cosmic - ray muons .",
    "based on a reconstructed track , @xmath7 can be corrected to account for both the attenuation of light in the fiber , and the dependence of light yields on the incident angle ( @xmath8 ) of a particle on a fiber sheet : @xmath9 the first term is the correction for attenuation of the scintillation light in the fiber and reflection at the far end of fiber coated with aluminum  @xcite .",

    "individual photoelectrons are distributed around the fiber    center according to a gaussian distribution with parameters determined    using data of a single photoelectrons from led calibration run .",
    "the    size of the pixel cluster corresponding to the single photoelectron is    then chosen from distributions of the led data , and the pixel cluster    is simulated accordingly .",
    "the energy scale is tuned for each iit using    cosmic - ray muon data .",
    "3 .  : :    random noise in a pixel cluster is generated for each iit based on    neutrino - beam data .",
    "two kinds of noise pixels are generated .",
    "one is isolated single hit pixels around the main pixel cluster of a charged track in step * 2.*. the other is random noise pixels in a pixel cluster generated in step * 3.*. the total number of noise hits averaged over iits is 1.67 for mc and 1.72 for cosmic - ray data . based on the pixel simulation , the average number of noise hits is expected to be 70 per event . in the cosmic - ray data we find 52 hits per event due to the random noise of ccd , and 17 hits per event due to the beam associated background .",

    "the track finding algorithm in the scifi is optimized for the charged current interactions which contain a muon in the final state .",
    "the track finding algorithm consists of three steps .",
    "first , the track finder searches for 2-dimensional ( 2d ) track candidates in the @xmath32 or @xmath33 planes which traverse at least three layers of scifi .",
    "a 3-dimensional track is reconstructed by selecting the best combination of two 2d tracks . in order to reduce the combinatorial fake tracks ,",
    "the starting and ending hit layers are required not to be different by more than one layer , and the overlapping of the two 2d tracks is required to be at least two layers .",
    "secondly , the combinatorial background or noise tracks are removed using other components of the near detector ( veto and mrd ) . a track candidate in the scifi",
    "is required to match with both a hit in the veto and a track in the mrd .",
    "once a good primary track is found , the most upstream hit - position of the primary track is considered as a neutrino interaction point .",

    "these tracks are mostly short tracks with two or more scifi hits .",
    "this method of extra track finding turns out to be an effective way to find short tracks of protons and/or pions from the neutrino interactions .",
    "all the reconstructed tracks are subjected to a `` global fit '' , a straight line fit to the found hits .",
