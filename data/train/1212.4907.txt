    "one should pay attention that all the values displayed in the following pictures are the average one in the central region .      for largely equilibrated systems , fluxes of macro quantities , leading to dissipation , are proportional to gradients within the system .",
    "the shear viscosity denoted as @xmath1 is the coefficient of proportionality between anisotropy of momentum - flux tensor , including dissipation and velocity gradients @xcite . in the boltzmann statistical limit the shear viscosity corresponds to the first order chapman - enskog coefficients . in ref .",

    "as the density increases , the transition temperature also get larger , e.g. for normal density the transition temperature locates around 10 mev , but for 2.5 times normal density it is almost 50 mev .",
    "this conclusion is coincident with macroscopic result . and in the case of scaled n - n cross section , the shear viscosity just only needs to be scaled by @xmath76 , ie .",
    "@xmath77 from eq.[dani - eqn - cross ] we can see that the shear viscosity is very sensitive to the n - n cross section , the larger the cross section is , the smaller the shear viscosity . and",
    "it is intuitive that large n - n cross section makes the transport of particle momentum much difficult .",
    "since the equilibrium of the considered nuclear matter at the very starting stage is not reached , the calculated shear viscosity should be considered as the transport properties of largely equilibrated nuclear matter with the same density and kinetic energy density .     and @xmath4 with the eq.([dani - eqn ] ) .",

    "one can see that both @xmath75 and @xmath82 are reaching their maxima at about 20 fm / c and at a bit earlier time for higher energy .",
    "after the compression stage the matter starts to expand and some of them will escape from the central region , mainly in the transverse plane , the matter density drops to very small values and the central region is cooled down .",

    "it should be noted that the large kinetic energy density dose not mean higher temperature , since the kinetic energy is not calculated in the center of mass frame , detailed information can be found in refs .",

    "<S> thermodynamic and transport properties of nuclear fireball created in the central region of heavy - ion collisions below 400 mev / nucleon are investigated within the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamic ( iqmd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> these properties including the density , temperature , chemical potential , entropy density ( @xmath0 ) and shear viscosity ( @xmath1 ) , are calculated by a generalized hot thomas fermi formulism and a parameterized function , which was developed by danielewicz . as the collision goes on , </S>",
    "<S> a transient minimal @xmath2 occurs in the largest compression stage . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the relationship of @xmath3 to temperature ( @xmath4 ) in the freeze - out stage displays a local minimum which is about 9 - 20 times @xmath5 around @xmath4 = 8 - 12 mev , which can be argued as indicative of a liquid gas phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the influences of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross section ( @xmath6 ) and symmetry energy coefficient ( @xmath7 ) are also discussed , and it is found that the results are sensitive to @xmath6 but not to @xmath7 . </S>"
