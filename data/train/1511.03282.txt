    "<S> the ising nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) associated with the zero temperature transition from a symmetric to a nematic _ metal _ is an exemplar of metallic quantum criticality . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out a minus sign - free quantum monte carlo study of this qcp for a two dimensional lattice model with sizes up to @xmath0 sites . </S>",
    "<S> for the parameters in this study , some ( but not all ) correlation functions exhibit scaling behavior over the accessible ranges of temperature , ( imaginary ) time , and distance , and the system remains non - superconducting down to the lowest accessible temperatures . the observed scaling behavior has remarkable similarities with recently measured properties of the fe - based superconductors proximate to their putative nematic qcp . </S>"
