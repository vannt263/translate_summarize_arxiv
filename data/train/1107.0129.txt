    "a small number of arguments in the paper rely on the freedom to choose the characteristic of @xmath12 coprime to the index of a covering space ; in such situations we restrict to working with @xmath2 lagrangians , and then the relevant fukaya categories are defined over @xmath15 .",

    "it seems likely that theorem [ thm : main ] holds in more generality ( for self - plumbings ; for plumbings along submanifolds of codimension @xmath30 ) , but our argument employs a geometric trick using lefschetz fibrations ( section [ sec : embedd - plumb - lefsch ] ) which is more restrictive .",

    "theorem 3.1 of @xcite states that equation is a chain equivalence , which respects the action filtration ; on the right hand side , the action of a chord @xmath389 is @xmath834 where @xmath480 is the liouville form .",
    "more precisely , @xcite asserts that , after passing to the associated graded with respect to the action filtration , the map from morse homology to floer homology assigns to each geodesic the corresponding reeb chord .",
    "let us now consider the situation of a plumbing : from equation , we conclude that we have a codimension @xmath278 embedding @xmath835 let us write @xmath447 for the cotangent fibre at @xmath103 , considered as a lagrangian in @xmath836 .",
    "since all based geodesics for @xmath663 of action less than @xmath837 are contained in @xmath838 ( see lemma [ lem : short_loops_independent_of_t ] ) , we may use the previous machinery to define a moduli space @xmath839 whenever @xmath389 is a chord in @xmath699 with endpoints on @xmath645 , and @xmath461 a geodesic for @xmath663 of action less than @xmath465 .",
    "note that , even in the special case when @xmath389 lies in @xmath840 , elements of this moduli space do not , a priori , have image contained in @xmath841 .    from this moduli space ,",
    "we obtain a map @xmath842 here @xmath843 is the square of the cylindrical coordinate with respect to the decomposition @xmath844 .",
    "note that this function extends the squared norm ( with respect to @xmath663 ) of a cotangent vector in @xmath845 .",
    "let @xmath846 denote the subcomplex of the right hand side generated by chords whose action is bounded by @xmath847 .      from the discussion above",
    ", the natural bases of @xmath849 and @xmath850 can be identified , since they both correspond to geodesics in @xmath851 with vanishing jacobi index .",
    "the exactness of @xmath699 and equation ( 3.1 ) of @xcite imply that equation ( [ eq : map_to_cw ] ) preserves the action filtration : in the natural bases above , the corresponding matrix is therefore upper triangular .",
    "moreover , as in the case of cotangent bundles , the diagonal entries of this matrix are @xmath852 , corresponding to stationary solutions of the pseudo - holomorphic curve equation satisfied by elements of @xmath839 .",
    "we conclude that the map @xmath853 is an isomorphism . since the morse complex is supported in non - negative degrees , whilst the floer complex is supported in non - positive degrees , passing to cohomology in degree @xmath278 is obtained by taking the quotients of the two sides in equation ( [ eq : map_to_cw - bounded - action ] ) by the image of degree @xmath73 elements on the left , and degree @xmath854 elements on the right .",
    "we conclude that the induced map on cohomology is surjective .        from the fact that @xmath856 computes the ordinary homology of the space of based loops on @xmath857 of bounded energy , and equation",
    ", we compute that the homology of the limit in equation is the homology of the space of based loops in @xmath858 .",
    "note that , since the dimension of @xmath792 is greater than @xmath73 , every loop in @xmath21 is homotopic to a loop lying in @xmath859 , and , since the dimension is greater than @xmath411 , every homotopy between loops in @xmath21 can be assumed to lie in @xmath860 .",
    "we conclude          the proof is a straightforward cobordism argument , along the same lines as the case of cotangent bundles , considered in section 5 of @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that one can glue the domains of the half - cylinders in equations and , to obtain a pseudo - holomorphic map whose source is an annulus of very large modular parameter . by considering the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic maps whose source is an annulus of arbitrary modular parameter , one obtains a homotopy between the composition of with and the natural map @xmath862 which assigns to every critical point of @xmath863 the chain represented by a triangulation of its descending manifold .",
    "passing to the direct limit over @xmath465 , and to homology , we conclude that the composition @xmath864 is homotopic to the map @xmath865 induced by the inclusion @xmath866 . by our assumption on the dimension of @xmath21 ,",
    "this map is an isomorphism in degree @xmath278 .",
    "we conclude :      since the compositions of equations and is the identity , the first map must be surjective , and the second injective .",
    "however , we already know that equation is a surjection , so it is therefore an isomorphism . since the inverse to an isomorphism is necessarily injective , we conclude that equations is an isomorphism as well ."
