    "the fact that tidal dissipation plays a role in the organisation of planetary systems has been clear since the first detections of extrasolar planets .",
    "the absence of eccentric orbits ( commonplace at larger separations ) with small periastra indicates that tidal circularisation must take place for planets with periods @xmath0  days .",
    "this likely represents a measure of the dissipation in the planet itself , but the discovery of planets with orbital periods @xmath11  day suggests that tidal dissipation in the star may also set a limit on the long - term survival of close - in planets .",
    "this has acquired particular relevance recently , with the discovery of correlations between the properties of the host star and the planetary orbit ( winn et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "a wide range of theoretical calculations of tidal interactions have been performed in order to investigate potential mechanisms for the microphysical dissipation , and to illuminate plausible values of gross measures of dissipation , such as the ` tidal q ' parameter ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 ; marcy et al . 1997 ; terquem et al . 1998 ; ogilvie & lin 2004 , 2007 ; ivanov & papaloizou 2004 ; wu 2005 ; jackson , greenberg & barnes 2008 ; goodman & lackner 2009 ) .",
    "this has led to a wide range of estimates for the strength of tidal dissipation in these systems . in order to properly understand how such estimates match to theory",
    ", we need to consider the ensemble of observations within the context of a single formalism . in hansen ( 2010 )",
    "( hereafter h10 ) , we presented an analysis of the extant exoplanet database within the context of equilibrium tide theory , as laid out in the exposition of eggleton , kiseleva & hut ( 1998 ) . in that simplified model",
    ", we assumed a single bulk dissipation constant per unit mass , @xmath2 , for all host stars in the range 0.71.4 @xmath3 and a second similar parameter , @xmath4 , for all gas giant planets @xmath5 .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that it is possible to calibrate these two parameters to yield a coherent description of a wide range of observed exoplanet systems .",
    "it is desirable , however , to go beyond this simple assumption .",
    "the analysis in h10 used single values of the dissipation constant for all stars and planets respectively , and stopped short of adopting a detailed microphysical model . nevertheless , it is possible to calculate plausible values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 if one adopts a model for the internal structure of an object , and calculates the amount of dissipation expected from the turbulent viscosity engendered in the convection zone of a given star or planet .",
    "that is our goal in this paper  to go beyond the assumption of uniform values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and to calculate their values as a function of mass and age , for both planets and host stars .",
    "the advantage is that we may then explore possible trends with stellar and planetary properties within the context of the model , and potentially illuminate further the role that tides play in sculpting the architecture of exoplanet systems .    in the following ,   [ model ] discusses the dissipation model we adopt , as well as the construction of stellar and planetary background structures that will determine the overall level of dissipation that occurs . in   [ stellar ] we apply this model to the observed population of stellar and planetary systems that are relevant for the purposes of constraining the strength of tides . in ",
    "[ discuss ] we apply our newly calibrated tidal theory to a series of issues including survival limits for planets and trends of misalignment with stellar type , reviewing our final conclusions in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "in h10 we calibrated the eggleton et al ( 1998 ) model ( hereafter ekh98 ) for tidal dissipation using the observed properties of extrasolar planet systems .",
    "the attractive feature of that particular model was that the macroscopic evolution equations were cast in terms of a bulk dissipation constant @xmath6 , which related the rate of energy dissipation to the rate of variation of the quadropole moment of the body due to the tidally induced circulation within the body .",
    "we consider this a more transparent formulation than the traditional approach of using a tidal ` quality factor ' , q. nevertheless , the approach taken in h10 is still a gross approximation , as it left the underlying microscopic physics unspecified , and thus offered no obvious path to generalise the formalism beyond our canonical solar - like stars and jupiter - class planets . in this paper",
    "we wish to try and extend our analysis to a more physically motivated model .",
    "we assume that the underlying dissipative mechanism is turbulent dissipation in convection zones . ekh98",
    "provide the formalism to do this as well .",
    "they demonstrate how the bulk dissipation constant @xmath6 is related to the turbulent dissipation in the star via the integral @xmath7 in this expression , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass and radius of the object and @xmath10 ( the q of ekh98 , which we have renamed to avoid confusion with the commonly used `` tidal q '' ) is the normalised quadropole moment .",
    "the integral is taken over the turbulent regions of the star , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the relevant velocity and mean free path .",
    "the function @xmath13 is a radial weighting determined by the tidally - induced velocity field in the star .",
    "it is the action of the turbulent viscosity on this time dependent flow field that ultimately provides the tidal torque .    in this paper",
    "we will assume the turbulence is the result of convection , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 determined from the standard mixing length theory .",
    "we will thus have a viscosity @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a normalisation constant to be determined from the overall analysis but which we expect to be of order unity , @xmath17 is the pressure scale height , @xmath18 is the mixing length convective velocity and @xmath19 is a function included to address the possibility of a frequency dependance in the coupling between tidal forcing dissipation .",
    "there are two prominent proposals in the literature .",
    "the first is that due to zahn ( 1977 ; 1989 ) , who proposed a form @xmath20 where p is the forcing period and @xmath21 is the eddy turnover time . on the other hand , goldreich & collaborators ( goldreich & nicholson 1977 ; goldreich & keeley 1977 ) favour a form @xmath22 guidance as to the correct form is not yet wholly forthcoming from analysis of the microphysics .",
    "recently penev , barranco & sasselov ( 2009,2011 ) have performed numerical simulations of forced anelastic convection and find a scaling closer to the linear model at the periods of interest to us . at shorter periods",
    "they find a sharper fall - off in dissipative efficiency , suggesting that both the zahn & goldreich et al .",
    "models may be valid in different regimes .",
    "on the other hand , ogilvie & lesur ( 2012 ) find better agreement with the quadratic model .",
    "we will proceed with the linear zahn scaling as it will enable us to better compare our model with others in the literature .      to describe the structure of main sequence stars of various mass and age",
    ", we use the ez - web models ( paxton 2004 ) .",
    "figure  [ czsurf ] shows the mass of the surface convection zone for solar metallicity stars of various masses from 0.3@xmath3 to 1.5@xmath3 , for two different ages ( 0.1  gyr and 1  gyr ) .",
    "we see that the mass in the convection zone becomes comparable to brown dwarf or planet masses once the host star mass @xmath23 . for stars greater than this mass",
    "the degree of coupling between the convection zone and the rest of the star is of relevance , as it will determine how easy it is for the star to spin up the surface layers to synchronism . also of relevance",
    "is the question of how much of these convection zones actually couple strongly to perturbations , if the convective overturn times are much larger than the forcing period . figure  [ turnover ] shows the profile of convective eddy turnover time as a function of radius for stars with masses @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we see that the much of the greater mass fraction in convection zones has eddy turnover times of many days , suggesting that they might possibly not play as important a role as the layers closer to the surface , where the eddy times are shorter .",
    "this will serve to equilibrate the response partially across the mass spectrum .",
    "the actual result of these competing trends is shown in figure  [ sig ] , where we show the effective stellar dissipation @xmath27 ( assuming @xmath28 and the normalisation of h10 ) for a range of stellar masses , assuming a stellar age of 1  gyr and a forcing period of 1  day , using the zahn scaling .",
    "we see that the lower - mass stars , with larger convection zones , do possess stronger dissipation , while the main sequence a stars show much reduced dissipation .",
    "the mean value for @xmath27 derived in h10 is realised for @xmath29 .",
    "the size of the surface convection zone also evolves with time , especially for those stars that proceed far enough to become subgiants and giants when they are observed .",
    "figure  [ czevol ] shows the evolution of the surface convection zone for a 1.5  @xmath3 star as it evolves .",
    "although a 1.5@xmath3 star begins with a very small surface convection zone , it acquires a mass comparable to a jupiter mass planet within @xmath301  gyr .",
    "this will become relevant when we consider the planets observed around subgiants (   [ hotsubs ] ) , where the radial velocity technique is easier to apply than for hotter main sequence stars .",
    "the rapid increase in convection zone mass along the red giant branch is evident as well .",
    "dissipation in the star produces two principal effects , orbital decay and stellar spin - up .",
    "the characteristic timescale for orbital decay due to stellar dissipation is given by equation  ( 10 ) of h10 , @xmath31 the characteristic time to change the spin of the star is , using the formulae in ekh98 and h10 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stellar radius of gyration .",
    "this will become particularly important when we evaluate the change in orbital obliquity relative to the star (   [ rm ] ) .",
    "turbulent convective dissipation is also potentially a source of viscosity in gas giant planets , as such objects are largely convective throughout their evolution .",
    "thus , we apply the same model to planetary structure models calculated with the models in hansen & barman ( 2007 ) , although we have extended the mass range as required .",
    "figure  [ sigp ] shows the resulting values of @xmath34 for a series of giant planets . in the top panel ,",
    "we show @xmath34 for a @xmath35 planet at age 1  gyr , using both the zahn & goldreich / nicholson prescriptions . in the bottom panel",
    ", we show the same function for planets of younger age ( 0.1  gyr  more suitable for the epoch of circularisation ) and masses of 0.3@xmath36 , 1@xmath36 and 3@xmath36 .",
    "a common point of comparison is the effective @xmath37 parameter derived for jupiter .",
    "the 1  gyr , @xmath35 models suggest @xmath38 using the zahn presciption , and @xmath39 using the goldreich & nicholson prescription , assuming a forcing period of 10  hours , using equation  ( 11 ) of h10 .",
    "these values are consistent with previous estimates ( e.g. goldreich & nicholson 1977 ) , in the sense that they are too large to explain the origin of the laplace resonance amongst the galilean satellites .",
    "indeed , they lie well above the recent empirical value measured by lainey et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "this highlights a note of potential caution in applying our approach to the planets in these systems .",
    "the relatively low rotation of the planet host stars is an important motivation for why the equilibrium tide model , as outlined in h10 &   [ starmodels ] might be applicable .",
    "indeed , we found ( h10 ) that the level of dissipation in close stellar binaries is well above that found in planet - hosting stars of similar mass .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to an enhanced level of dissipation in synchronously rotating bodies ( resulting from a greater commensurability between the tidal forcing and internal oscillation modes of the star , e.g. ogilvie & lin 2007 ) . in the systems under discussion",
    ", we expect the planets , unlike their host stars , to be synchronously rotating , and thus they could also potentially have higher rates of dissipation ( ogilvie & lin 2004 ; wu 2005 ; goodman & lackner 2009 )",
    ". this may also be the explanation for the discrepancy between the inferred jovian numbers and those derived from our model .",
    "nevertheless , our motivation in this study is not to provide a comprehensive description of potential contributors to tidal evolution , but to evaluate the simplest possible , widely applicable , model and the degree to which it can explain the observations .",
    "we will therefore proceed with the initial assumption that the convective dissipation model does indeed underlie the dissipation in the planets , and evaluate where a greater level of dissipation is actually required by the observations , as might be provided by a dynamical contribution to the tide .",
    "such calibrations could represent a long - term average over the shorter term variability inherent in such modal excitations .",
    "our planetary models provide not only internal models to evaluate @xmath34 , but also the evolution of the planetary radius with time , which can strongly affect the strength of tidal interactions .",
    "we do not include possible extra sources of energy invoked to explain some anomalously large observed radii , because these anomalies are now believed to be related to the level of irradiation received ( e.g. showman & guillot 2002 ; fortney , marley & barnes 2007 ; demory & seager 2011 ) and the bulk of the circularisation occurs at separations where irradiation is energetically irrelevant .",
    "a more important process in this context is the radius inflation due to tidal dissipation within the planet .",
    "we use our cooling models to establish a relationship between internal entropy and radius .",
    "the exact nature of this relationship depends on the manner of the energy dissipation , described in appendix  [ planet_heat ] . in that section",
    "we motivate our model to treat the heating due to tidal dissipation as a simple reversal of the cooling along the same track .",
    "the evolution of a particular planet depends on the competition between cooling and tidal heating within a given scenario , but we can get an approximate criterion for the division between survival and disruption by determining the locus of semi - major axis and eccentricity such that the tidal heating balances the cooling for a young planet ( because circularisation times are @xmath40@xmath41  years ) . figure  [ disrupt ] shows this criterion between disruption and survival for a 0.5@xmath36 planet .",
    "we see that the curve of constant angular momentum ( because tidal dissipation in the planet removes energy much more efficiently than angular momentum ) that grazes this boundary produces circularised orbits at approximately the right separation to match the observed concentration around an orbital period of three days .",
    "this lends support to the assertion of faber , rasio & ford ( 2005 ) that the characteristic orbital periods of hot jupiters are related to the roche lobe limit .",
    "systems that lie initially above the dashed line in figure  [ disrupt ] will eventually be heated to the point of disruption , before they reach tidal circularisation .",
    "with interior structure models for both exoplanets and stellar hosts , and a model for the tidal dissipation , we can now calculate the tidal evolution of planet - star systems and compare them to observations .",
    "however , before we compare to the planetary systems themselves , we note that there is a class of stellar binary that is also applicable to the problem of constraining the strength of tidal dissipation .",
    "an exercise of the kind we perform here has already been performed in the context of compact objects orbited by giant stars with large convective envelopes .",
    "verbunt & phinney ( 1995 ) tested the equilibrium tide model for convective envelopes by comparing models to the observed eccentricity - period relation for spectroscopic binaries containing evolved stars in open clusters .",
    "they claim that the convective dissipation model of zahn describes the observations well . an internally consistent model for the dissipation of tides in convective zones should be able to incorporate this constraint as well as those from exoplanet systems .",
    "thus , we wish to compare our model with the same observations as verbunt & phinney ( hereafter vp ) to estimate plausible ranges for the parameters of our model and to demonstrate the consistency across multiple stellar regimes .    for the purposes of direct comparison with the analysis of vp , we can recast equation  ( 3 ) of h10 in an equivalent form , and calculate the integrated ( over stellar evolution ) change in eccentricity ( in the low eccentricity limit ) to be @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is now @xmath44 the effect of dissipation in the evolving star is captured in the function @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ i2 ] shows @xmath43 as a function of stellar radius @xmath9 ( a more useful quantity observationally than time ) , along with the corresponding behaviour of @xmath2 , normalised as in h10 , for a 2.3 @xmath3 star , as it evolves up the giant branch , through core helium burning , and back to the agb .",
    "vp set a criterion of @xmath45 as the value that marks the transition between systems that should have been circularised and those that were not .",
    "the stars that are most important for the model comparison are those designated as c and o in table  2 of vp .",
    "we have repeated their analysis for these systems using our model .",
    "the stellar radius inferred from the photometry for star o allows for it to be in multiple possible evolutionary stages , and we have adopted a status as a red clump star for this object , based on the same rationale as vp ( that stars of corresponding radius spend more time in this stage than ascending the red giant branch for the first time ) . the resulting distribution of @xmath46 for the various vp stars is shown in figure  [ dle ] .",
    "we see that that c and o bracket the observed transition from circularised to eccentric orbits .",
    "the fact that this transition brackets @xmath47 suggests that the nominal normalisation @xmath48 is a satisfactory fit to the observations .",
    "setting @xmath49 will move the points in figure  [ dle ] to the left , which preserves the fidelity of the model as long as system  c retains @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 . if we insist that system  o conform to the requirement @xmath52 , then require @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we have a broad constraint that @xmath54 .",
    "the lower limit here is based on a single circular orbit . since stars",
    "can , in principle , form with circular orbits , a more conservative estimate would use the next circular system , star  d , which imposes a looser constraint @xmath55 .    in closing",
    "we also note that this comparison tells us little about the appropriate scaling of dissipation with forcing period , as the relative orbital ( i.e. forcing ) periods are in the range 100 - 200 days , and the turnover times in the convective envelope of a giant at the tip of the red giant branch are @xmath56  days .",
    "thus , the full spectrum of convective eddies couples to the giant envelope .",
    "nevertheless , it sets a constraint on the normalisation of the model that will then constrain the application to the planet and planet host sample .      for the exoplanet systems , the mass ratio between planet and host star , in addition to the separation , will determine the relative importance of dissipation in the planet and the star .",
    "we therefore analyse a series of three different planet - star samples . in each case",
    ", we choose a wide range of initial semi - major axis and eccentricity , and evolve the system forward using the formalism outlined in ekh98 and h10 . the dissipation constants @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath27 are now functions of time , because they are calculated using the models for the evolution of the host star and planet . in the case of the planets",
    ", we also include the resulting instantaneous tidal heating as a heat source , which combats the planet cooling .",
    "we assume that the planet follows the same relationship between radius and internal entropy throughout , so that strongly heated planets reverse their evolution along the cooling track . for sufficient heating",
    ", planets can overflow their roche lobes .",
    "our first sample of exoplanet systems is that containing massive ( @xmath57 ) planets . as discussed in h10 , the relative evolution timescales for stellar and planetary tides scale as @xmath58 so our best constraints on the properties of the host stars are to be found from stars which host massive companions in close orbits .",
    "the systems that provided the best constraints in that case were wasp-14b , xo-3b , hat - p-2b , wasp-18b and hat - p-34b .",
    "the sample and it s properties are collected in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note that these systems can only provide upper limits on @xmath16 , because the uncertain origins of these planets means that some could have been formed on circular orbits , in which case the lack of eccentricity offers no constraint .",
    "however , given an observed eccentricity and age , we can determine that an orbit would have circularised if @xmath16 was too large .",
    "the planetary system xo-3b ( johns - krull et al .",
    "2008 ; winn et al .",
    "2009a ) consists of @xmath59 planet in a 3.2  day orbit about a 1.2  @xmath3 star , according to the most recent analysis ( southworth 2010 ) .",
    "we have applied our dissipation model to the evolving surface convection zone of a 1.2  @xmath3 star , and are able to match the period and eccentricity of the system .",
    "satisfactory matches are achieved for @xmath60 , assuming an age range for the system of 23.4  gyr .",
    "figure  [ xo3_init ] shows the range of final periods and eccentricities for an xo-3 star - planet combination , assuming @xmath61 in both star and planet .",
    "one potential evolution is shown in figure  [ xo3_ex ] .",
    "we see that the stellar tide plays a significant role in the evolution of this system , as significant orbital angular momentum is transferred to the star .",
    "it is possible to spin the star up to the observed rotation period , and we will return to this issue in   [ rm ] .",
    "hat - p-2b ( bakos et al . 2007b ; pal et al . 2010 ) is similarly well fit by the model with @xmath62 , given the recently upwardly revised stellar mass ( @xmath63 ) and allowing an age range of 23.1  gyr .",
    "wasp-14b has a lower mass host star ( @xmath64 ) and consequently larger convective zone and more dissipation .",
    "however , the low estimated age of 0.5 - 1.0  gyr ( joshi et al . 2008 ) means that the constraint is very loose , allowing a wide range of eccentricity for wasp-14b .",
    "the star wasp-18b ( hellier et al . 2009 ) has a mass @xmath65 ( southworth et al .",
    "2009 ) , and is orbited by a planet of mass 10.3@xmath36 once every 0.94 days .",
    "once again , the model fits the observations well for ages @xmath662  gyr .",
    "we can match period and eccentricity well with @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ wasp18 ] shows the allowed parameter space for @xmath61 .",
    "the large planet mass and short orbital period means that stellar tides are particularly important in this system , and we see that significant stellar spin - up is expected for this star . however , this constraint is somewhat weakened by the reanalysis of the radial velocity data by pont et al . ( 2011 ) & husnoo et al .",
    "they find that the previously reported non - zero eccentricity is not statistically significant , and determine only an upper limit of @xmath68 .",
    "for this planet , and other systems for which husnoo et al . derive weaker constraints , we will note limits based on both the literature values and the weaker constraints , to illustrate the insensitivity of our results to residual uncertainties in the observed values .    the recently announced planet hat - p-34b has a mass of 3.3  @xmath36 and",
    "orbits a star with mass @xmath69 and age @xmath70  gyr .",
    "the two sigma range of the eccentricity for this object requires that @xmath71 . the host star in this system actually rotates faster than the orbital period of the star , but the planet is too distant for the stellar spin to have a significant effect .",
    "these five systems placed significant constraint on the model presented in h10 , but are well matched within the mass - dependant formalism presented here . in part",
    "this is because all four systems orbit relatively massive main sequence stars , so that that small size of the convection zone ( and concomitant reduced level of convective dissipation ) reduces the importance of the stellar tide in these systems .",
    "there are other massive planets , such as corot-3b , corot-14b , koi-13.01 or wasp-30b , which could also potentially offer useful constraints , but their eccentricities are not well enough measured to be useful at present .",
    "the most interesting object in the massive planet sample is found in the binary star system hd41004 , although it was excluded from the analysis of h10 because the host star mass was lower than the calibrated range .",
    "santos et al . ( 2002 ) originally monitored the spectrum of the a component , a k  star , for radial velocity periodicity .",
    "a signal was detected but , on the basis of a correlation with variability in the line bisector of the combined spectrum , it was deduced that the host was actually the fainter m - dwarf component of the system , hd41004  b. this has since been confimed by zucker et al .",
    "( 2003,2004 ) , using cross - correlation methods developed for double - line spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the remarkable aspect of this system is that the companion is itself a potential brown dwarf ( @xmath72 ) in a very short period orbit ( 1.3  days ) .",
    "santos et al .",
    "infer an age for the k - dwarf companion of 1.6  gyr , based on chromospheric activity .",
    "thus , we will allow models of ages 12  gyr .",
    "this system is an excellent test of our model because the m dwarf is almost fully convective , so that the dissipation now occurs throughout the star .",
    "furthermore , the high mass of the companion and the short period orbit guarantee significant tidal interactions . despite this , the planet is well outside the location where it is likely to be swallowed within the age of the system  orbital periods as low as 8  hours would survive for @xmath73  gyr with our final stellar dissipation calibration .",
    "however , the measured eccentricity proves problematic  dissipation at the calibrated levels in the convective brown dwarf companion should have reduced the eccentricity below the limit measured by zucker et al .",
    "figure  [ hd41004 ] shows the allowed separation - eccentricity space for the hd  41004  b system .",
    "we require @xmath74 to match the observed eccentricity , which is formally inconsistent with our constraint from   [ vpsec ] .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of the system limits the degree to which we can really use this as a constraint .",
    "zucker et al . ( 2004 ) note that the stellar companion is close enough that it could conceivably provide sufficient perturbations to excite the eccentricity , and also find hints of a possible linear trend in the data that may betray an additional perturbing companion .",
    "given the possibility of external perturbations , we restrict ourselves to deriving a characteristic timescale for circularisation in this system .",
    "we repeat our above fitting procedure , but assume that the system is 1.5  gyr at the start ( this results in a smaller companion radius and lower dissipation rate in the planet ) .",
    "we find that the characteristic timescale to damp @xmath75 at p=1.3  days is @xmath76  gyr , for an assumed value @xmath61 .      the massive , short period planets are the best probes of the strength of the stellar tide .",
    "the strength of the planetary tide is best constrained by those systems that define the edge of the period - eccentricity distribution at larger periods and eccentricities , where the stellar tide is negligible . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we collect several systems that trace this edge , selecting planets with masses @xmath77 ( smaller planets could be potentially rock or ice - dominated , leading to possibly different dissipation processes )",
    ". we will fit to the @xmath78 limits on the eccentricity , and therefore only select systems that have non - zero eccentricities at this level .",
    "we probe a range of masses , from 0.2  @xmath36 to 3.2@xmath36 ( in addition to some of the more massive systems discussed in   [ bighosts ] ) .",
    "the short period end of the envelope is fixed by the systems hat - p-16b , wasp-10b and wasp-6b .",
    "hat - p-16b ( bucchave et al . 2010 ) is not massive enough to make the sample in table  [ tab1 ] , but with a planetary mass @xmath79 it is still more massive than average . the original non - zero eccentricity is confirmed by pont et al .",
    "the age is also sufficiently well constrained ( @xmath80 gyr ) that our models restrict @xmath81 .",
    "the constraint is shown in figure  [ hatp16 ] .",
    "the constraints based on systems wasp-10b and wasp-6b are less clear .",
    "christian et al . ( 2009 ) remark on the ` surprising ' finite eccentricity of the wasp-10b orbit , but we find that the 2@xmath6 limit on the eccentricity can accomodate @xmath82 , assuming an age @xmath83  gyr .",
    "wasp-6b is a similar system ( gillon et al .",

    "hd108147b has substantial error bars on the eccentricity , so that it allows @xmath90 . for corot-10b , the error bars are smaller , but the star has a large allowed age range ( 16 gyr ) , which allows an even larger range @xmath91 .",

    "therefore , we note that figure  [ nup ] does potentially allow for a factor of several increase in the strength of @xmath16 in planets with forcing periods longer than six days , which might indicate the action of enhanced dissipation due to a dynamical tide .    in order to compare this number with prior estimates , we note that @xmath61 leads to @xmath94 for a middle - aged , solar mass star and forcing periods @xmath66  day . putting this number into equation  ( [ torb ] )",
    "yields a characteristic orbital decay timescale of 1.4  gyr , assuming a jupiter - mass perturber in a 1  day period orbit .",

    "the result of the new calibration is that we can produce a consistent description of tidal dissipation in convection zones , with @xmath108 .",

    "comparing this to the observed planets ( solid and open circles ) and kepler planet candidates ( crosses ) shows that most of the known planets are stable against being swallowed by their host stars during the observed system ages , and that the observed distribution appears to show an edge consistent with the 1  gyr criterion .",
    "there is a handful of systems that populate a tail to shorter lifetimes , with wasp-19b , wasp-18b , wasp-12b and corot-14b being those with the shortest remaining lifetimes .",

    "also evident in figure  [ stablim ] is the importance of the roche limit .",
    "since the inspiral time depends on the properties of the star , the only planetary parameter of relevance is the mass , and the solid and dotted lines in figure  [ stablim ] make no assumptions about planetary structure .",
    "however , the lower dashed line indicates the period at which a given mass planet will overflow it s roche lobe , assuming a uniform radius of @xmath115 for all planets .",
    "furthermore , if we allow for the planets to be placed on these orbits while still hot ( either as a result of youth or heating due to tidal circularisation ) the limit is even stronger , as shown by the upper dashed line .",
    "this suggests that the observed division between planets of mass @xmath116 and those of mass @xmath117 at orbital periods less than 3 days may be due to the fact that roche lobe overflow sets a limit to how close young , extended gaseous planets can get to the star .",
    "the lower mass ( @xmath117 ) planet population orbits below this line because they are enriched in heavy elements and are therefore denser .",
    "the same physics can be reflected in the current rates of period change , and so we have examined the current rate of orbital period decay for all systems with orbital periods @xmath118  days plus a few others of clear interest . the data for these is collected in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "for a given system , evolution models yield some variation depending on initial conditions , but the results are found to be within 30% of the rate estimated by simply dividing the observed period by the inspiral time given in equation  ( [ torb ] ) , as long as one uses the appropriately calibrated @xmath27 .",

    "winn et al ( 2010a ) have demonstrated that the degree of orbital misalignment of various exoplanets with host star spin appears to correlate with the effective temperature of the host star .",
    "they note that this correlation suggests that the larger surface convective zones of lower mass / cooler main sequence stars produce stronger tidal coupling to the planets and reduces the planetary obliquity .",
    "their model claims , however , to require a degree of decoupling between the surface convection zone and the radiative region below , and possibly also the action of a magnetic wind to remove angular momentum .    in order to apply our newly calibrated model to this issue",

    "we use the current orbital period as the forcing period for each system .",
    "we see that only the wasp-18b , wasp-19b , corot-18b and hat - p-23b planets are expected to have undergone significant orbital evolution in response to the spin - up of the central star . on the other hand",
    ", the star itself often has a smaller moment of inertia than the planetary orbit , and the stellar spin - up time @xmath125 ( equation  [ tspin ] ) can differ from the orbital evolution time by an order of magnitude or more for some systems , despite some claims made in the literature .",
    "therefore , figure  [ tsp ] shows the misalignment plotted against @xmath125 for each star - planet system .",

    "the largest misalignment of this group is that of xo-3b .",
    "these characteristic times are calculated assuming a slow rotation for the star , regardless of the observed rotation rate , as the goal is to identify systems for which the tidal interactions are expected to adjust the stellar spin . in the case of xo-3b , the host star is observed to be rotating almost synchonously ( johns - krull et al .",
    "2008 ) , as one would expect from this estimate .",
    "a consequence of tidal spin - up is that the stellar spin may be increased significantly .",
    "figure  [ lv2 ] shows the measured @xmath127 versus @xmath128 for each of the observed systems .",
    "we also show three sample theoretical trajectories , calculated using equation  4 of h10 .",
    "there is some ambiguity in performing the comparison between theory and observation because only the sky - projected angle and velocities are measured ( see winn & fabrycky 2010 for an exposition of the difference between @xmath129 and @xmath128 ) .",
    "we show a sample trajectory for wasp-18b , assuming that the system was initially rotating retrograde .",
    "the short value of @xmath125 for this system indicates that stellar tides could have completely reversed the stellar spin .",
    "we also sample evolutions of corot-1b and xo-3b , two moderately misaligned systems with @xmath130 years or less . for stars with a significant initial spin perpendicular to the orbital plane ,",
    "it is impossible to completely align the orbit without significant decrease of the semi - major axis , as the tides only affect the stellar spin parallel to the orbit .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath127 measured for the star contains the entire velocity associated with the projection of the stellar spin vector on the sky , which can contain a component of the spin perpendicular to the orbit as well . in such cases , the reversal of the parallel spin does not pass through @xmath131 .",
    "despite these uncertainties , figure  [ lv2 ] demonstrates the character of the spin - misalignment evolution in this model .",
    "the degree of spin - up required is not necessarily enough to dramatically alter the stellar parameters , as we can see from figure  [ lv2 ] that @xmath132 can be found for retrograde systems , for which there is little spin - up .",
    "pont ( 2009 ) and husnoo et al . (",
    "2012 ) have claimed evidence for excess rotation in several planet host stars associated with tidal interactions . for seven of these systems ( corot-2b , corot-18b , hat - p-2b , hat - p-20b , wasp-19b , wasp-43b and xo-3b ) our spin - up times are consistent with some alteration of stellar spin , although three others ( corot-3b , hd189733b and @xmath21  boo  b ) appear to be too weakly coupled to have evolved significantly .",
    "previous attempts at modelling these effects ( barker & ogilvie 2009 ; winn et al .",
    "2010a ) have emphasized the importance of magnetic stellar winds in spinning down the host stars .",
    "however , this is necessary primarily because the strength of the tidal interaction assumed in those studies was greater than is found here , so that a spin - down mechanism was needed in order to reduce the expected stellar spin - up to the observed level . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have repeated our spin - up calculations using the spin - down law from barker & ogilvie @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 for g , k , m stars , and @xmath135 for f stars ) , and found no change in our conclusions .",
    "this is because the effects of the magnetic wind are weak when the spins are slow . we can derive a magnetic breaking timescale equivalent to equation  ( [ tspin ] ) , @xmath136 which is plotted as a band in figure  [ tsp ] , and shows that the bulk of the aligned systems should experience an approximate equilibrium between tidal spin - up and magnetic breaking",
    "this braking will also not affect the trajectories in figure  [ lv2 ] , but only the rate of motion along the trajectories .",
    "thus , with our calibration of the tidal dissipation , the correlation noted by winn et al .",
    "( 2010a ) can be consistently interpreted as demonstrating the effect of tides primarily on the stellar spin , without significant orbital evolution in most cases .",
    "only four systems in this sample are likely to have undergone much orbital evolution , but as many as 12 are likely to have experienced some modifications of their spins .",
    "the fact that hotter stellar temperatures appear to favour misaligned orbits is consistent with the reduced amount of dissipation in the thin surface convection zones , making it more difficult to change the spin of the star .",
    "winn et al also proposed a model in which the tides couple only to the stellar surface convection zone , out of concern that the moment of inertia of the entire star would prove to be too large a sink of angular momentum , causing an unacceptably rapid rate of inspiral . with our calibration",
    "this concern proves to be unfounded . indeed ,",
    "if we use the moment of inertia of just the convection zones to calculate equation  ( [ tspin ] ) , shown in figure  [ tsp2 ] , many of the misaligned systems exhibit unacceptably short synchronisation times  an efficient transfer of angular momentum from the dissipative regions to the radiative interior is actually an essential requirement for consistency in this model .    triaud ( 2011 )",
    "has recently claimed a correlation between the degree of misalignment and the age of observed systems , but only 5 of the 22 systems in that sample have @xmath137  years , and 4 of those are in the young group .",
    "as such , if the misalignment is being removed over time , it is not due to the action of stellar tides .",
    "lai ( 2011 ) has addressed the question of misalignment versus orbital decay by postulating that planets on retrograde orbits can couple more easily to stellar internal modes than those on prograde ones , allowing for more rapid evolution in obliquity than semi - major axis .",
    "although we have shown that the difference in the stellar and orbital moments of inertia is sufficient to allow for a consistent evolution , the sample in figure  [ tsp ] does show hints of a slope , in the sense that most of the retrograde systems have @xmath138 years , whereas one might expect the edge of the distribution to lie closer to @xmath139 years .",
    "if real , this leaves some room for stronger dissipation in retrograde systems .",
    "section  [ rm ] assumed that most host stars initially had relatively slow rotation , but some of the known transitting planets orbit hot stars , whose spin rates are significantly higher than their cooler counterparts .",
    "this can lead to qualitatively different behaviour , because for rapidly spinning stars , the transfer of angular momentum can be outwards , from star to planetary orbit .",
    "the transitting planet wasp-33b serves as a demonstration of this .",
    "the host star is a main sequence a star , with rotational velocity @xmath140 ( collier cameron et al .",
    "2010 ) , so that radial velocity precision is severely compromised through line dilution ( because of the high effective temperature ) and broadening ( high velocity ) .",
    "we model the evolution of this system in tandem with the rotational evolution of the host star , including radial expansion and evolution of the moment of inertia .",
    "we assume angular momentum conservation as a solid body during the expansion ( because the winds from hot stars are weak ) .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum from the rapidly rotating star to the planet causes the planet to move outward in semi - major axis .",
    "as the star evolves and swells , the spin decreases and eventually the tidal coupling causes the planet to spiral inwards .",
    "the location of the orbital turnaround point depends on the planet mass . for planets @xmath116 ,",
    "the maximum orbital period is @xmath141 days , but it gets out to 2.7  days for @xmath142 planets and could get as large as 5 days if the planet were @xmath143 ( although collier cameron et al . place a limit of 4.1@xmath36 on this particular object ) .",
    "the planet is eventually swallowed during the ascent of the giant branch , hastened by the fact that the transfer of angular momentum from the planet orbit to the star is dwarfed by the increase in the moment of inertia as the star evolves , so that the late - time inspiral of the planet has a negligible spin - up effect on the star .",
    "the spin - down / cooling of hot stars during their evolution to the giant branch has been utilised by several groups to probe a higher mass range for stellar hosts ( sato et al .",
    "2003 ; hatzes et al . 2005 ; johnson et al . 2006 , 2007 ; lovis & mayor 2007 ; liu et al 2008 ; sato et al 2008 ; de medeiros et al . 2009",
    "; johnson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this has led to claims of higher mass planets around higher mass hosts and a paucity of short orbital period planets . with our calibrated model",
    "we can now evaluate the tidal stability limit for stars of different evolutionary stages .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ ra ] for host stars of 1.2 and 1.5@xmath3 .",
    "two cases are shown for the latter mass  one assuming an initially slowly rotating star ( 30 day rotation period ) and another a rapidly rotating star ( 1 day rotation period ) .",
    "we see that tidal instability can explain the paucity of companions to subgiants interior to 0.1  au ( sato et al .",
    "2008 ; hansen 2010 ; kunitomo et al .",
    "this effect is stronger for lower mass stars , in the sense that the planets with semi - major axis @xmath144 are swallowed at smaller stellar radius than for higher mass stars , and may therefore lend support to the notion that the observed subgiant population is contaminated with lower mass stars ( lloyd 2011 ) .",
    "however , there is little difference in the implications for planets from 0.10.6  au , so that tidal forces do not appear to be the explanation for the lack of planets in this regime .",
    "the region out to 0.6  au can be cleared by tidal engulfment by the time the red giant tip is reached , in agreement with kunitomo et al .",
    "2011 , but the paucity of planets in this middle region around ascending stars ( @xmath145 ) is not obviously explained by this mechanism .",

    "as we have discussed , the expected pseudo - synchronisation of the planets in these systems raises the possibility of exciting internal modes which may enhance the tidal dissipation . to examine the consequences of such an enhancement ,",
    "the right hand side of figure  [ xoeo ] shows a model in which we keep @xmath61 for the star , but increase @xmath147 for the planet .",
    "we see that the character of the solutions remain the same although the upper end of the eccentricity distribution moves to slightly higher values .",
    "the edges of the wedge are now defined by a periastron of 0.035  au and a final circularised radius of 0.054  au .",
    "this tail of high eccentricity initial conditions defines a characteristic range of final circularisation periods , and therefore represents a specific realisation of the hypothesis of faber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , that the pile - up at three days represents the circularisation of eccentric orbits , limited at short periods by roche lobe overflow",
    ". however , within the context of our model , this does not extend to origins at large semi - major axis , as planets starting at @xmath148  au are heated to the point of runaway inflation and disruption .",
    "figure  [ edot ] illustrates this point by showing the tidal luminosity in a 1  @xmath36 planet as a function of eccentricity , assuming either a fixed periastron ( dotted line ) or angular momentum conservation ( solid line ) .",
    "we see that the reason the inner edge in figure  [ xoeo ] is defined by a line of constant periastron is that this luminosity asymptotes at large eccentricity , so that it will naturally map onto the critical value of tidal dissipation needed to overwhelm cooling in a particular planet .",
    "the fact that the luminosity along the circularisation trajectory continues to increase at large eccentricity means that there is a critical value below which circularisation is stable against tidal inflation .",
    "one other important element in this calculation is the quasi - linear dependance of the dissipation rate on orbital period in this model ( see figure  [ sigp ] ) .",
    "if we fix the dissipation to the value at forcing period of the final circular orbit , the luminosity along the constant angular momentum curve is given by the dashed line .",
    "thus , the tidal inflation is driven , in part , by the increased coupling to the internal viscosity at longer forcing periods .",
    "figure  [ xo2 ] demonstrates this , by showing an equivalent plot to those in figure  [ xoeo ] , but now with the dissipation fixed to the value calculated at a forcing period of 1  day ( and with @xmath61 ) .",

    "thus , it is the increased efficiency of coupling at longer orbital periods that drives the planets to disruption . in",

    "figure  [ ma ] also shows a dashed curve which represents the locus of planets that circularise within @xmath41 years from a starting point determined by setting @xmath154 and the total dissipation from tidal heating to @xmath155 .",
    "this represents the edge of runaway heating and disruption , as shown in figure  [ xoeo ] for example .",
    "we see that this traces the inner edge of the planetary distribution quite well .",
    "it lies close to the criterion of ford & rasio ( 2006 ) , for circularisation to twice the roche limit .",

    "we find that the stellar tides are weak enough that only a few known systems have orbits which are likely to have been significantly affected , but that there are several more whose stellar spins are likely to have been altered enough to reduce the relative obliquity .",
    "recent observations regarding the properties of planetary systems with high obliquities are consistent with this model in that all systems which possess short enough spin - up times are found to have low obliquity . it is also encouraging that this model does not require a decoupling between the surface convection zone and the interior of the star .",
    "a further implication is that the distinction between misaligned and aligned orbits is not solely due to the action of tides , because there is a distinct population of planets whose orbits are aligned despite having long alignment times . figure  [ nosync ] shows the resulting period - eccentricity relations when we separate prograde and retrograde orbits , excluding those systems for which obliquities could have been tidally altered . with the sole exception of hd  17156b , the systems",
    "whose orbits and spins are primordially prograde have almost circular orbits , in contrast to the systems which are either primordially retrograde or whose primordial obliquities have been potentially compromised .",
    "this suggests that retrograde orbits might also be preferentially eccentric , and that there are at least two different pathways to forming short period planetary systems .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by schlaufman ( 2010 ) , although we draw different divisions between the two samples .",
    "furthermore , this separation indicates that eccentricity pumping by rapidly rotating pre - main sequence host stars ( dobbs - dixon , lin & mardling 2004 ) is unlikely to explain the observations , as this would produce aligned , prograde eccentric planetary orbits .",
    "we have also modelled the increase in tidal dissipation in stars as they evolve towards the giant branch , and find that planetary systems with initial semi - major axes @xmath158  au will be swallowed during the subgiant stage and that the tidal swallowing distance can reach @xmath159  au during later evolutionary stages .",
    "the distribution of observed systems suggests that many hosts may have masses closer to @xmath64 than @xmath160 , in that the frequency of such systems drops off sharply beyond the theoretical limit of the former case .",
    "convective turbulence may also play a role in providing the tidal dissipation in the planets .",
    "our calibration is consistent with the same normalisation being applicable to both host stars and giant planets .",
    "however , our constraints are such that we can accommodate a factor of several higher normalisation in the planets , leaving open the possibility of a dynamical tide contribution .",
    "the amount of tidal heating that accompanies circularisation proves to be a limiting factor , as planets with initially high eccentricity orbits are often significantly inflated , to the point of undergoing roche lobe overflow .",
    "our results suggest that the pile - up at @xmath1613  day orbital periods can arise from the circularisation of initially eccentric planets , but only those with initially @xmath162 .",
    "this restriction is based on the assumption that roche lobe overflow is catastrophic , and may be relaxed if this is not the case .",
    "furthermore , an important part of the catastrophic heating is the increased efficiency of coupling between the turbulent dissipation and forcing period for long period eccentric orbits .",
    "if this is reduced below what is expected from our model , then planets can survive the circularisation from further out .",
    "nevertheless , the data do seem to support the notion of faber et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , that the pile - up of hot jupiter orbital periods is the result of tidal capture from eccentric orbits , albeit modified by some restrictions placed by tidal heating and roche lobe overflow that restrict the initial semi - major axis to @xmath158  au .",
    "the fact that the orbital distribution is consistent with a similar level of dissipation in both planets and stars is somewhat surprising .",
    "the bulk of the exoplanet host stars are slowly rotating , but we expect most planets to have spins synchronised to the orbital period , which increases the likelihood of coupling internal dynamical modes to the forcing frequencies and increasing the level of dissipation . some enhancement in dissipation in the planets is still possible , as we have shown that such an order of magnitude increase in dissipation moves the circularisation period out from 2.7  days to 4.6  days , which approximately covers the observed pile - up of orbital periods .",
    "however , substantial increases in dissipation will likely exacerbate the tendency of planets on high eccentricity orbits to heat up and expand until they overflow their roche lobes .",
    "this is an issue that clearly deserves greater attention in the future .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services , the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org , and ren heller s holt - rossiter - mclaughlin encyclopaedia at www.aip.de .",

    "the dissipation of tidal energy in the planet can far exceed the internal luminosity for some parts of parameter space .",
    "this level of energy input can significantly affect the structure of a planet .",
    "in particular , since radius is intimately linked with the internal entropy , we expect heating to be accompanied by radius inflation . within the context of the convective dissipation model adopted in   [ model ] , we can calculate which part of the planet contributes most to the dissipation .",
    "figure  [ sigint ] shows the accumulation of the integral  ( [ sigma_integral ] ) as a function of pressure for a 1  @xmath36 planet , of age @xmath41  years , experiencing a tidal perturbation with frequency 10 days , assuming the zahn efficiency coupling .",
    "these parameters are chosen to represent the conditions for an eccentric jupiter - mass planet which will end up at a few days orbital period once circularised .",
    "we see that the integral is dominated by the outer layers of the star , because that is where the convective eddy turnover times are comparable to the forcing period and hence the coupling is strongest .",
    "figure  [ 3lums ] shows the effect of enforcing a heating of different prescribed levels in the same planet as represented in figure  [ sigint ] , in which the heating is restricted to the part of the planet with @xmath163 .",
    "we see that above luminosities @xmath164 , this leads to an unstable situation , in which the amount of dissipated heat is too much for the outer layers to transport without considerable radial expansion . if we assume the same total level of dissipation , but spread equally over the planet mass , the radius expansion is not as large , asymptoting to a finite radius within a kelvin - helmholtz time .",
    "a fully self - consistent model would integrate each evolutionary curve while simultaneously heating the planet according to the appropriate dissipation profile .",
    "however , this is not computationally feasible , given the large parameter space we wish to survey .",
    "instead , we adopt the approximation of uniform heating of the planet , which allows us to approximate planet evolution under tidal heating to a simple reversal of the cooling curve .",
    "the results shown here indicate that this is the conservative assumption , since a realistic dissipation profile is more likely to result in runaway inflation and tidal disruption ( see   [ overflow ] for why this is then the most conservative option ) .",
    "figure  [ ltc ] shows the our model for a 1 jupiter mass planet  taken to significantly hotter levels than most planet models , even so - called hot start models .",
    "if the planet is heated too much it can undergo roche lobe overflow ( e.g. gu , bodenheimer & lin 2003 ) . if the radius expands to the point where the planet begins to overflow it s roche lobe , we assume the result is catastrophic disruption of the planet . some authors ( e.g. gu et al .",
    "2003 ) have attempted to describe the varieties of possible subsequent evolution , but we have opted to assume complete disruption of such planets to keep the calibrated model simple .",
    "this assumption has some physical basis in that the mass - radius relation of heated planets results in expansion in the event of mass loss , and the effects of a fixed amount of tidal dissipation are greater for lower mass planets .",

    "<S> our analysis suggests that the survival of circularised planets is strongly affected by the amount of heat dissipated , which is often large enough to lead to runaway orbital inflation and roche lobe overflow . </S>"
