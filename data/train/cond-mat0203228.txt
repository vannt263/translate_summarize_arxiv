    "after the report of the magnetic quantum oscillations in the superconducting state of 2_h_-nbse@xmath1 more than quarter century ago,@xcite the oscillations of the magnetization , de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect , in the vortex state seems to be confirmed experimentally for a variety of the type - ii superconductors in the last decade.@xcite common experimental results of the dhva oscillations in the superconducting state are that the additional damping of the oscillation amplitude appears below the upper critical field @xmath2 with respect to the normal state damping .",
    "the additional damping has been discussed in several ways theoretically.@xcite the questions in those discussions are summarized as follows;@xcite ( 1 ) if the superconducting gap @xmath3 exists in the vortex state just below @xmath2 , it would have drastically damped the oscillations at low temperatures by a factor of @xmath4 , ( 2 ) the inhomogeneous field distribution due to the flux lattice would broaden the landau levels , and ( 3 ) the inhomogeneity in the superconducting order parameter associated with the vortex lattice leads to inhomogeneous broadening of the landau levels in the quasiparticle spectrum near the fermi surface . thus the oscillations include basically rich information on the quasiparticle in magnetic fields and also the vortex matter properties.@xcite    shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in the superconducting state is very difficult to be observed because the finite resistivity is needed inevitably .",
    "then it can appear in the quite limited field - temperature region where the long - range translational order of the vortices is lost .",
    "quasi two dimensional ( q2d ) organic superconductors are good candidate for the observation of sdh effect in the vortex state because large fluctuations induce the wide vortex liquid region.@xcite at low temperature below 1 k , the quantum vortex liquid ( qvl ) is realized in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 ( @xmath5 10 k ) due to the large quantum fluctuation instead of the thermal one.@xcite in the qvl region , the finite resistivity is expected to remain even below @xmath6 .",
    "recently the transport properties in the qvl region have been examined in detail , and the finite resistivity has been confirmed.@xcite    in this paper , we report the sdh oscillations observed in the qvl region of the q2d organic superconductor @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 .",
    "an additional damping of the oscillation amplitude appears on both the sdh and dhva effects around @xmath2 , which may come from the superconducting fluctuation . at lower temperature in the qvl region ,",
    "however , the stronger damping is observed only on the sdh effect .",
    "the different magnetic field dependence of the additional damping of the oscillation amplitude between the sdh and dhva effects is discussed in connection with the effect of the transport current on the short - range order of vortices in the quantum vortex slush state@xcite reported at the same temperature and magnetic field region .",
    "high quality single crystals of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 were grown by an electrochemical oxidation method .",
    "the magnetic torque measurements were performed by using precision capacitance torquemeter .",
    "the in - plane and the out of plane resistivities were measured along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes , respectively , by means of a conventional ac or dc four terminal method .",
    "the electrical terminals were made of evaporated gold films , and gold wires ( 10 @xmath9 m ) were glued onto the films with gold or silver paint .",
    "the contact resistance was about 10 @xmath10 for each contact at room temperature , but it became less than 1 @xmath10 at low temperature where the experiments were carried out .",
    "the torquemeter and the samples for the resistivity measurements were fixed to the single axis rotation holder which can change the sample direction with respect to the magnetic field with the accuracy of 0.05 degree .",
    "the holder with the samples was cooled slowly from room temperature to 4.2  k in 48 hours and specially slow cooling rate was used between 50 and 75  k in order to avoid the disorder of the terminal ethylene group of the bedt - ttf molecules .",
    "@xcite the holder was directly immersed in liquid @xmath11he of the refrigerator which was combined with a 15 t superconducting magnet at the high magnetic field laboratory for superconducting materials ( hflsm ) , imr , tohoku university .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained on three samples # 1 for the magnetic torque , and # 2 and # 3 for the resistivity measurements from different batches .",
    "we found that other one sample for the magnetic torque and one sample for the resistivity gave qualitatively similar results which were not presented in this paper .",

    "1(b ) ) , and the dhva oscillations with one fundamental frequency of @xmath16 599 @xmath17 2  t are observed in both the normal and superconducting states .",
    "the quality of the sample used in this study seems to be better than that in the previous work@xcite judging from the large amplitude of the dhva oscillations .",
    "the reversible magnetic torque region ( @xmath18 3  t @xmath19 @xmath20 7  t ) below 1  k is expected to be the qvl region .",
    "the finite resistivity appears in the qvl region even at @xmath21 0 .",
    "the detail of the transport properties in the qvl region has been already reported.@xcite it is noted only here that a weak non - linear behavior of the resistivity is found in the qvl region .",
    "such non - linearity is not observed in the thermal vortex liquid ( tvl ) region above 1 k. the concept of the quantum vortex slush has been proposed for the non - linear behavior below 1  k. the vortex slush with only the short - range order of vortices has been found in the high-@xmath22 oxides.@xcite the effect of the quantum vortex slush and the tvl states on the dhva and sdh effects will be discussed latter .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity in the sample # 2 at @xmath14 0.52 k. the in - plane ( @xmath23 ) and the out of plane ( @xmath24 ) resistivities are measured in one single crystal along the @xmath7 and @xmath8-axes , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity and the resistivity onset corresponding to @xmath25 are not influenced by the applied current density in both configurations .",
    "the flux flow resistivity in the qvl region , however , changes a little with the current density because of the weak non - linear resistance.@xcite the two curves in this figure are measured using the current density ( current ) of @xmath26 0.16 a/@xmath27 ( @xmath28 100 @xmath29a ) for @xmath23 and 1.6 ma/@xmath27 ( 10 @xmath29a ) for @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the sdh oscillations with the frequency of 599 @xmath17 2  t are clearly observed .",

    "the magnetic breakdown orbit @xmath31 , consisting of the @xmath30 and opened @xmath32 orbits , has been observed in both sdh and dhva oscillations.@xcite we , however , restrict ourselves to the single band model for the following analysis and discussion on the sdh and dhva effects because the magnetic field used in the present study is smaller than the magnetic breakdown field.@xcite the amplitude of the sdh oscillation on @xmath24 is much larger than that on @xmath23 , although the magnitude of the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity is almost the same with two configurations .",
    "the reason is not known at present but the similar tendency is commonly seen in the q2d organic conductors.@xcite    in order to see the sdh oscillations in low magnetic field region , @xmath33 is shown in the lower right inset of fig .",
    ", @xmath34 is the oscillatory part of the conductivity obtained by subtracting the non - oscillatory part of the conductivity , and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the normal conductivity which is the same with the non - oscillatory part of the conductivity in the normal state . in the vortex state below about 7  t",
    ", sdh oscillations come from the normal ( quasi particle ) component of the total conductivity which includes additional non - equilibrium superconducting component due to the vortex pinning . the normal ( quasi particle ) part of the conductivity roughly corresponds to the flux flow conductivity .",
    "then the normal resistivity @xmath37 in the vortex state is assumed to be extrapolated smoothly from the normal state into the vortex state toward @xmath38 0 at @xmath39 0 . the dotted line in fig .",
    "2 shows the normal ( quasi particle ) resistivity @xmath37 in the normal ( vortex ) state .",
    "the line is obtained as almost linear in the vortex state and passing through the middle of the sdh oscillations in the normal state . in intermediate region around 7  t , two lines are connected smoothly by the simple second order polynomial function . the sdh oscillation is persisting down to about 5  t where the resistivity is about 30 % of the normal state value ( @xmath40 1.5  @xmath10 cm at 7  t ) .",
    "in the other sample # 3 the oscillations can be seen in lower magnetic field of about 4.5  t , which are shown latter in fig .",
    "this is first unambiguous observation of the sdh oscillations on the flux flow resistance in the well characterized superconductor .",
    "similar sdh effect in the superconducting state has been reported in the @xmath41-type bedt - ttf organic superconductor.@xcite but it did not show the additional amplitude damping in both the sdh and dhva oscillations in the superconducting state",

    "it is noted that both dhva and sdh oscillations in this experiment are measured in the quantum vortex slush region . in the case of such measurements in the tvl state ,",
    "the additional damping in the vortex state is expected to be the same in dhva and sdh effects because tvl does not have any order of vortices .",
    "thus neither the presence of the transport current in the measurements of the sdh effect nor the absence of current in the dhva effect alters any phase coherence . on the other hand , sdh effect in the quantum vortex slush state may be affected by moving vortices due to applying the transport current .",
    "it may disturb such coherency of the vortices and quasiparticles .",
    "non - observation of stronger oscillation amplitude damping in the dhva effect with basically no transport current demonstrates the influence of the moving vortices by the current in the quantum vortex slush state .    besides applying transport current ,",

    "but the oscillation amplitude at 0.43  k shows stronger additional damping in low magnetic field than others measured at high temperature .",
    "this stronger damping observed at 0.43  k is considered to be due to the moving vortices in the quantum vortex slush state as discussed above .",
    "it is expected that the similar stronger damping may appear below about 5.5 , and 5 t at 0.76 and 0.88  k , respectively , where the boundary between the quantum vortex slush and the thermal vortex liquid regions is located.@xcite this boundary can be seen in the schematic vortex phase diagram in the low temperature region@xcite shown in the upper left inset of fig .",

    "it means that the magnetic fields where the sdh oscillations are observed are mostly still in the tvl region .",
    "then the magnetic field dependence of the damping seems to follow the damping by the thermal fluctuations with temperature .",
    "this result suggests that the expected stronger damping may appear at lower magnetic fields .    in order to confirm the proposed model on the stronger damping in the sdh oscillations in the quantum vortex slush state ,",
    "it is necessary to show the clear relation between the stronger damping and the vortex phase diagram .",
    "more precise measurements at lower magnetic fields in better quality sample are required in future .",
    "the transport current density dependence of the sdh oscillation amplitude is also important to measure in the quantum vortex slush state because the non - linear behavior in the resistivity has been observed .",
    "these experiments are in progress .",
    "we observed the sdh oscillations on the flux flow resistivity in the vortex state of the q2d organic superconductor @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 .",

    ", the stronger damping appears in the quantum vortex slush region .",
    "the stronger damping may reflect the perturbation of a phase coherence of vortices and quasiparticles in the quantum vortex slush state with the short - range order of vortices due to moving those by the transport current .    the authors thank k. kishigi , t. maniv , t. nishizaki for stimulating discussions .",

    "<S> the magnitude of the additional damping near @xmath2 is the same with that observed in the dhva oscillations and well explained by the theoretical predictions in consideration of fluctuations in the thermal vortex liquid state . in the quantum fluctuation region at lower temperature , however , only sdh effect shows the stronger damping than that of the dhva oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the different magnetic field dependence of the additional damping of the oscillation amplitude between the sdh and dhva effects is discussed in connection with the effect of the transport current on the short - range order of vortices in the quantum vortex slush state reported at the same temperature and magnetic field region . </S>"
