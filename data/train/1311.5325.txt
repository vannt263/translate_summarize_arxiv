    "the inflation theory is introduced to solve a number of cosmological conundrums ( the monopole , horizon , flatness , and entropy problems ) in the standard cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the inflation stage sits in an area where the hubble parameter @xmath2 is approximately a constant , and @xmath3 . in this stage",
    "the equation of state parameter is @xmath4 , which is the equation of state for the scalar field usually .",
    "it means that the potential of the scalar field is dominated in this stage , until the inflation is ended . at the time @xmath5",
    "can not be ignored any more , and @xmath6 . in the inflation area , the scalar field has no interaction with other field except for the gravitational field , and the density fluctuation is caused by the fluctuation of the vacuum .",
    "the inflation stage is lying in a low temperature area , so this inflation theory is always called cool inflation ( or , standard inflation ) , which is in contrast with warm inflation .",
    "warm inflation is caused by interacting fields between scalar field and radiation .",
    "just like the cool inflation , the warm inflation stays in a stage where the potential of scalar field dominated .",
    "a lot of evidences show that the inflation is a brilliant candidate theory to explain the very early universe ( i.e. , see @xcite ) .",
    "but there are still some problems need to be solved , one of which is the singularity of the universe . if the universe is filled with radiation and matter , according to the general relativity theory , coming back in time , one concludes that there exists a primeval singularity which is named as the big bang singularity .",
    "the big bang singularity problem could be seen as a deficiency of einstein cosmology at high energies .    to solve the big bang singularity problem ,",
    "one possible solution is modifying the theory of general relativity at high energies .",
    "there are lots of candidates , one of them is lqc ( more recently review , please see @xcite ) .",
    "lqc is a canonical quantization of homogeneous spacetimes based upon the techniques used in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite . due to the homogeneous and isotropic spacetime",
    ", the phase space of lqc is simplifier than lqg , e.g. , the connection is determined by a single parameter called @xmath7 and the triad is determined by @xmath8 .",
    "recently , it has been showed that the loop quantum effects can be described very well by effective modified friedmann dynamics .",
    "people always consider two kinds of correction of effective lqc , one is inverse volume correction , the other is holonomy correction . considering these modification , one can obtain many interesting results , e.g. , the big bang will be replaced by big bounce @xcite , the most of singularity will be avoid @xcite , the inflation will be more likely to occur @xcite , and so on .",
    "but the first modification suffers from gauge dependence which can not be cured and thus yields unphysical effects .",
    "we will discuss the dynamical behavior of scalar field in lqc based on the secondary modification . in this effective lqc , a term , @xmath9 , will be added to the right sides of the standard friedmann equation . since this correction comes with a negative sign , the hubble parameter @xmath2 , and then @xmath10 will vanishes when @xmath11 , and the quantum bounce occurs and then oscillates forever .",
    "therefore , using the second type of the modification to the friedmann equation , the physically appealing features of the first one are retained . moreover , for a universe with a large - scalar factor , the first type of modification to the friedmann equation can be neglected and only the second type of modification is important .    the super - inflation , which is caused by the quantum geometry effect in lqc @xcite , has been studied by many papers @xcite .",
    "some papers found that the scale factor changes too small to solve the flatness and horizon problem during super - inflation stage @xcite , whereas the hubble parameter @xmath2 is visibly growing during this stage , then some papers argued that the horizon problem can be solved at the super - inflation area @xcite .",
    "also , the duration of super - inflation , or the change of scale factor depends on the initial value of the scalar field @xcite , or the parameter of the potential of the scalar field @xcite .",
    "all those researches discussed the universe contains a self - interact or massless scalar field .",
    "and the simple fluid models for super - inflation also discussed @xcite , and they found that it is possible to distinguish the spectrum of b - modes of super - inflation in lqc and standard inflation in the future observations . as we mentioned at the first paragraph of this section , depending on whether the scalar field can interact with the radiation or not , the inflation theory can be called as warm inflation or cool ( standard ) inflation theory . the warm inflation theory in lqc has been discussed by @xcite . according to the works of @xcite , the warm inflation is different from the one in einstein cosmology , so ,",
    "it is nature to investigate the appearance of super - inflation when considering the scalar field interacts with radiation during this stage . in this letter",
    ", we will discuss this phenomenon .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in sec . [ s2 ] , we will introduce some basic equations of lqc and the warm inflation ; in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we will show the changes of scale factor during the super - inflation stage , in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , we will discuss the horizon problem of super - inflation , and we will give some conclusions in the last sec .",
    "we focus on the flat frw cosmology in this letter .",
    "the effective equations in lqc are derived from the lqc hamiltonian constraint operator and include the leading order quantum gravity corrections to the classical friedmann equation .",
    "it turns out that the effective equations provide a surprisingly good approximation to the dynamics of sharply peaked states in lqc at all times , including at the bounce point where quantum gravity effects are strongest @xcite . in this letter , we focus on the holonomy correction , then the modified friedmann equation reads @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the critical energy density .",
    "we consider the universe is sourced by a scalar field @xmath14 with positive potential @xmath15 coupled with radiation .",
    "then , the total energy density is @xmath16 , with the energy density of scalar field @xmath17 and the energy density of radiation @xmath18 .",
    "the potential @xmath19 is usually considered as a function of the field @xmath14 and the temperature @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 , but , for simplicity , we just consider it is a function of the field @xmath14 , and we assume potential is a chaotic potential @xmath22 , with the mass of scalar field @xmath23 . considering the conversation of energy density",
    ", one can get @xmath24 in which @xmath0 is a damping coefficient and is responsible for the decay of the scalar field into radiation .",
    "usually , @xmath0 is considered as a function of the field @xmath14 , or temperature @xmath20 , or both , or , just a constant . in this letter , we just consider it is a constant . according to the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath25 should be satisfied .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and @xmath23 should be determined by the observational data , and some connections may exist between them , just as shown in @xcite .",
    "but we just consider a phenomenological results of interacting scalar field and radiation during super - inflation stage , so we choose this two parameters arbitrary .",
    "@xmath26 is the adiabatic index , which satisfies @xmath27 , for the pressure @xmath28 of radiation , then @xmath29 .    using eqs.([dphi ] ) and",
    "( [ drg ] ) , it is easy to verify the total energy density is conservation @xmath30    combining eq.([fri ] ) with eq.([ted ] ) , one can get @xmath31.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{dh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to eq.([fri ] ) , we can find that @xmath32 when @xmath11 , which is the quantum bounce point .",
    "it is easy to find that @xmath33 at the bounce point and it holds positive until @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath33 means the universe is in a super - inflation stage . in this stage ,",
    "the hubble parameter increases , and the scale factor changes also . for @xmath35 , this stage is staying in quantum effect dominated area , then the super - inflation is rooting in the quantum geometry effect .",
    "to solve the horizon problem , it needs at least 60 e - folding number . in the standard inflation theory ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath36 changes rapidly and the hubble parameter @xmath2 remains nearly constant . according to the truth that the e - folding number comes from the changing of the scale factor in standard inflation",
    ", someone concluded that the e - folding number created during super - inflation in lqc is not sufficient @xcite , but then it was found that the e - folding number during super - inflation depends on the initial conditions @xcite or the parameter of the potential of the scalar field @xcite . to show the change of the scale factor @xmath36 during the super - inflation stage",
    ", we will discuss the universe filled with the interacting field between massless scalar field and radiation at first , and , then give some numerical results in this section .",
    "the massless scalar field is always discussed in lqc .",
    "considering the case @xmath37 , then the energy density and the pressure of scalar field have the same form @xmath38 , and the equation of evolution of scalar field eq.([dphi ] ) becomes @xmath39 for simplicity , we consider @xmath40 case , then @xmath41 with a integral constant @xmath42 .    it should be mentioned that the super - inflation ends while @xmath43 .",
    "always , scale factor changes very small during the super - inflation stage .",
    "it is convenient to assume that @xmath44 is very small when super - inflation ends , and the duration of super- inflation is very short , then , scale factor can be expanded in taylor series @xmath45 hence the hubble parameter becomes @xmath46t+[3a_3 - 3a_1a_2+a_1 ^ 3]t^2+\\cdots,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with some constants @xmath47 , where we have assumed that @xmath48 at the bounce point .",

    "more explicitly , we have @xmath63^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath64 in which we have used @xmath65 at the bounce point",

    "it is easy to find that for a small damping coefficient @xmath0 , @xmath72 is increasing while @xmath53 becomes bigger .",
    "also , for a very large damping coefficient @xmath0 , if the energy density @xmath53 is very small , it is still possible to get a enough e - folding number .",
    "but if the change of scale factor is very large but not quickly enough , i.e. , the duration of super - inflation is very long , then , the taylor expanding of scale factor @xmath36 is not workable . to discuss the increasing the scale factor",
    ", it is necessary to use the numerical analysis .      in subsection [ s3a ]",
    ", we discussed the e - folding number for a special case .",
    "we found that the change of the scale factor depends on the value of the damping coefficient @xmath0 and @xmath53 , and it is possible to get enough e - folding number .",
    "but we used the taylor series of the scale factor in this case , so the results will be very inaccurate if the scale factor changes very slow . to get a more accurate result",
    ", we will discuss the change of the scale factor with the help of the numerical method .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in section [ s3 ] , we have discussed the changes of scale factor during super - inflation .",
    "we found that there is just a small e - folding number during super - inflation stage except for the case that the potential dominated at the bounce point , just as we showed in figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "if we follow the conclusion that the e - folding number is determined by the change of the scale factor , the results we got in the last section will be very disappointing : the super - inflation will not support enough e - folding number , and the slow rolling inflation is necessary sometimes .",
    "but it is should be remembered that the hubble parameter is not a constant during super - inflation area @xcite . to solve the horizon problem",
    ", we require that @xmath73 grows sufficiently during an early stage of the universe s evolution .",
    "in fact , we need @xmath74 at least @xcite . in the standard inflation theory ,",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath2 is nearly a constant , so the e - folding number is depending on the change of the scale factor , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "but the hubble parameter @xmath2 is not a constant during super - inflation any more @xcite . following the results of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the hubble parameter increases very quickly while the scale factor @xmath36 changes very small during the super - inflation stage ( just as the first , second and third pictures of the figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] shows ) , or the scale factor @xmath36 is changing significantly and the hubble parameter is also increasing ( just as the forth picture of figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] shows ) .",
    "there is no doubt that the super - inflation can support enough e - folding number , if one considers the potential dominated at the bounce point , just as we showed in the forth picture of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "but the question is , whether the super - inflation stage can always yield enough e - folding number . as we have mentioned before , to solve the horizon problem , we need @xmath76 during super - inflation stage . according to eq.([dh ] ) , we know that @xmath77 at the bounce point , this means that the universe enter super - inflation area as soon as the quantum bounce happens .",
    "so @xmath78 is the one which the value at the quantum bounce point , then @xmath79 in lqc .",
    "it is natural to get the conclusion that @xmath80 for super - inflation in lqc , so the super - inflation can solve the horizon problem .",
    "this result has been shown by many papers @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the single scalar field can solve the horizon problem during super - inflation stage in lqc . and ref .",
    "@xcite showed that super - inflation can support enough e - folding number while the universe contains matter and a small cosmology constant @xmath81 .",
    "also , if one considers the universe contains a scalar field or multiple scalar field with exponential potentials , the super - inflation is also possible to yield enough e - folding number @xcite .    to show the super - inflation stage can solve the horizon problem",
    ", we will follow the method of @xcite to calculate the particle horizon in lqc . for simplify",
    ", we choose the case i. in this case , the radiation dominates and the kinetic energy of scalar field sub - dominates at the bounce point.it is easy to find that the radiation is always dominating during the whole super - inflation stage from the first picture of fig .",
    "3 . according to this truth , we assume the energy density of scalar field is a constant @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , then using eq.([drg ] ) and eq.([fri ] ) we have @xmath84 \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{t - g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85 in which the initial value @xmath48 is used .    following the calculation of @xcite , and with the help of eqs.([t - g ] ) and ( [ a - g ] ) ,",
    "the particle horizon @xmath86 can be rewritten as @xmath87 { -}\\left [ { \\rho _ \\gamma ( t)+\\rho _ { \\phi _ 0}}\\right ] ^2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sim & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4\\rho _ c}\\int^{\\rho _ c-\\rho _ { \\phi _ 0}}\\frac{d\\rho _ \\gamma ( t)}{\\rho _ c-\\left [ \\rho _ \\gamma ( t)+\\rho _ { \\phi _ 0}\\right ] } % = + \\infty\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath88 is the bouncing time and scale factor at the bouncing point . according to the above calculation , the same result of @xcite could be obtained : _ when the universe enters the expanding phase , all the points of the universe are in causal contact and thus the universe has had enough time to be homogeneous and isotropic when it bounces_.",
    "as eq.([fri ] ) shows , the friedmann equation in lqc adds a @xmath89 term in the right side of the standard friedmann equation .",
    "the correction term @xmath90 comes with a negative sign , this makes the possibility that @xmath91 when @xmath11 , and the bounce occurs . at the bounce point , @xmath32 and @xmath92 is positive and the universe enters a super - inflation stage . equation ( [ dh ] ) shows that @xmath92 continues to positive till @xmath43 , at which point it vanishes ( after this point , it will become negative . ) .",
    "thus , every lqc solution has a super - inflation phase from @xmath11 to @xmath43 , which is staying in the quantum geometry dominated area .",
    "lots of papers researched the characteristic of super - inflation @xcite .",
    "some concluded that the suer inflation can not solve the horizon problem , while others argued it is possible .",
    "all these papers considered that the universe fills with a massless or self - interacting scalar field , or matter with a small cosmology constant @xmath81 . in this letter",
    ", we discuss the super- inflation in the condition that the contains a interacting scalar field and radiation .    in the standard inflation theory ,",
    "the e - folding number comes from the increment of the scale factor @xmath36 during inflation stage . to check the increasing value of the scale factor during super - inflation area",
    ", we considered the massless scalar field interacts with radiation at first . assumed",
    "the duration of super - inflation is very short and @xmath93 , we expanded the scale factor and got the expression of the e - folding number .",
    "we found that the e - folding number depends on the value of @xmath0 and @xmath56 ( or @xmath53 for @xmath94 at the bounce point ) , and it is possible to get a very large change of the scale factor , or get a very large value of e - folding number . since we used the taylor expansion of the scale factor ,",
    "this result is not reliable for all cases . to get more reliable result , we using the numerical method to analyze the evolutions picture of hubble parameter @xmath2 , the scale factor @xmath36 , and the energy density @xmath95 .",
    "four cases are considered , just as we mentioned in fig .",
    "we find that the scalar field changes very small in the first three cases , but changes very drastically in the forth case .",
    "for all four cases , the hubble parameter changes during super - inflation stage for @xmath33 . also , we find the value of @xmath0 also affects the value of the scale factor in the case iv , but it has very little influence on the first three cases , for the duration of super - inflation is too short to accumulate the interacting effect between the scalar field and radiation .",
    "moreover , we find that the universe will finally enter a radiation dominated stage , no matter which energy density dominated at the bounce point .    the hubble parameter changes in the super - inflation stage ,",
    "so the e - folding number depends not only on the variation of scale factor , but also on the hubble parameter .",
    "just as @xcite argued , the e - folding number is @xmath96 during super - inflation area . according to eqs.([fri ] ) and eq.([dh ] ) , it is easy to find that the universe enter the super - inflation stage when the bounce happens , which means that the initial value of hubble parameter @xmath97 , then @xmath98 at the super - inflation stage . to show that it is possible to solve the horizon problem in super - inflation stage",
    ", we followed the method of @xcite to calculate the particle horizon . assuming the radiation dominates at the bounce point",
    ", we find that @xmath99 , then all the points of the universe are in causal contact .    to obtain more information of super - inflation in lqc , perturbation theory should be considered .",
    "the perturbation theory of effective lqc has been discussed by many papers , and the possible observational effect has been analyzed ( more recently review , please see @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we just discuss some phenomenological results of super - inflation for the case that the universe is filled with interacting scalar field and radiation .",
