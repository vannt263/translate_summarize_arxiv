    "the mckay correspondence is originally a correspondence between the topology of the minimal resolution of a 2-dimensional rational double point , which is a quotient singularity by a finite subgroup @xmath0 of @xmath1 , and the representation theory ( irreducible representations or conjugacy classes ) of the group @xmath0 .",

    "the tensor product of these representations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trivial representation and @xmath14 is the number of the non - trivial irreducible representations , gives a set of integers @xmath15 and it determines the cartan matrix which defines the dynkin diagram . , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 identity matrix and @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "]    then we have a one - to - one numerical correspondence between non - trivial irreducible representations @xmath20 and irreducible exceptional curves @xmath21 , that is , the intersection matrix of the exceptional divisors is the opposite of the cartan matrix .    this phenomenon was explained geometrically in terms of vector bundles on the minimal resolution by gonzalez - sprinberg and verdier ( @xcite ) by case - by - case computations in 1983 . in 1985 , artin and verdier ( @xcite ) proved this more generally with reflexive modules and this theory was developed by esnault and knrrer ( @xcite , @xcite ) for more general quotient surface singularities .",

    "we can see that the string theoretic euler number of the resolution is the same as the order of the acting group @xmath0 in case @xmath40 , but it is different from the usual topological euler number of the minimal resolution . of course",

    "the special representations were defined by riemenschneider and wunram ( @xcite ) ; each of the special irreducible respresentations corresponds to an exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution of a 2-dimensional quotient singularity .    in particular",

    "around 1996 , nakamura and the author showed another way to the mckay correspondence with the help of the @xmath0-hilbert scheme , which is a 2-dimensional @xmath0-fixed set of the usual hilbert scheme of @xmath41-points on @xmath42 and isomorphic to the minimal resolution .",
    "kidoh ( @xcite ) proved that the @xmath0-hilbert scheme for general cyclic surface singularities is the minimal resolution .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in this section , we already gave a brief history of the mckay correspondence and we will discuss the special representations and the generalized mckay correspondence in the following section . in section three , we treat @xmath0-hilbert schemes as a resolution of singularities , consider the relation with the toric resolution in the cyclic case , and show how to find the special representations by combinatorics .",
    "in the final section , we will discuss an example and related topics .",
    "most of the contents of this paper are based on the author s talk in the summer school on toric geometry at fourier institute in grenoble , france in july 2000 , and she would like to thank the organizers for their hospitarity and the participants for the nice atmosphere .",
    "she would like to express her gratitude to professor riemenschneider for giving her a chance to consider the special representations via @xmath0-hilbert schemes and for the various comments and useful suggestions on her first draft .",

    "let @xmath0 be a finite small subgroup of @xmath44 , that is , the action of the group @xmath0 is free outside the origin , and @xmath11 be a representation of @xmath0 on @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath0 acts on @xmath46 and the quotient is a vector bundle on @xmath47 which can be extended to a reflexive sheaf @xmath48 on @xmath49 .",
    "for any reflexive sheaf @xmath48 on a rational surface singularity @xmath22 and the minimal resolution @xmath50 , we define a sheaf @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath53 , where @xmath54 means the dual .",
    "note that a sheaf @xmath52 is indecomposable if and only if the corresponding representation @xmath11 is irreducible .",
    "therefore we obtain an indecomposable full sheaf @xmath55 on @xmath3 for each irreducible representation @xmath10 , but in general , the number of the irreducible representations is larger than that of irreducible exceptional components",
    ". therefore wunram and riemenschneider introduced the notion of speciality for full sheaves :    ( @xcite ) a full sheaf is called _ special _ if and only if @xmath56    a reflexive sheaf @xmath48 on @xmath22 is _ special _ if @xmath52 is so .",
    "a representation @xmath11 is _ special _ if the associated reflexive sheaf @xmath48 on @xmath22 is special .    with these definitions , the following equivalent conditions for the speciality hold :    [ th : rw](@xcite , @xcite )    \\1 .",

    "recently a.  ishii ( @xcite ) proved more generally that the @xmath0-hilbert scheme for any small @xmath74 is always isomorphic to the minimal resolution of the singularity @xmath71 and the conjecture is true :    [ th : akira](@xcite ) let @xmath0 be a finite small subgroup of @xmath73 .",

    "a similar statement holds in dimension three , for @xmath82 , that is , the @xmath0-hilbert scheme is a 3-dimensional irreducible component of the @xmath0-fixed set of @xmath83 , and a crepant resolution of the quotient singularity @xmath23 ( cf .",

    "[ th : rw ] ( 3 ) , we have the definition of the special representation , and it is not easy to compute all special representations .",

    "an element @xmath119 is in @xmath120 if and only if @xmath121 that is , @xmath122 therefore the monomial basis for @xmath120 is the set of monomials @xmath123 such that @xmath124 under the action of @xmath0 , that is , monomials of weight @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , we have the monomial basis for @xmath126 as the set of monomials @xmath127 of weight @xmath128 .    the monomial basis for @xmath129 is given as the set of monomials @xmath123 of weight @xmath26 .",

    "if @xmath130 is surjective , then the monomial basis in @xmath131 can be obtained as the product of the monomial bases of two other sets .",
    "therefore the degree of the monomials in @xmath120 must be higher than the degree of the monomials in @xmath129 .",
    "now look at the map @xmath132 .",
    "the vector space @xmath133 is generated by the monomials of weight @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 where @xmath136 . on the other hand , @xmath137 is generated by the degree @xmath80 monomial @xmath138 .",
    "then the map @xmath132 is not surjective .    by this ,",

    "this means @xmath130 is not surjective .    moreover , if the bases of @xmath129 is generated only by @xmath142 and @xmath143 where @xmath144 , then the degrees of the monomials in @xmath120 are larger and @xmath130 is surjective",
    ". thus we have the assertion .    from this theorem",
    ", we can also say that a representation @xmath10 is special if and only if the number of the generators of the space @xmath129 is 2 .",
    "however , as a module over the invariant ring @xmath145 it is minimally generated by 2 elements . in this form , the remark is not new .",
    "it follows easily in one direction from the remark after theorem 2.1 in wunram s paper @xcite , and in the other direction from theorem 2.1 in combination with the fact proven in the first appendix of that paper that in the case of cyclic quotient surface singularities a reflexive module is determined by the `` chern numbers '' of its torsionfree preimage on the minimal resolution .",
    "[ th : b ] let @xmath97 be a fixed point by the @xmath0-action , then we can define an ideal @xmath96 by the @xmath0-cluster and the configuration of the exceptional divisors can be described by these data .",
    "the defining equation of the ideal @xmath96 is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are complex numbers and both @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( resp .",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath152 ) correspond to the same representation ( or character ) .",
    "the pair @xmath153 is a local affine coordinate near the fixed point @xmath97 and it is also obtained from the calculation with toric geometry .",
    "moreover each axis of the affine chart is just a exceptional curve or the original axis of @xmath42 .",
    "the exceptional curve is isomorphic to a @xmath154 and the points on it is written by the ratio like @xmath155 ( resp .",
    "@xmath156 ) which is corresponding to a special representation @xmath157 ( resp .",
    "@xmath158 ) .",
    "the fixed point @xmath97 is the intersection point of 2 exceptional curves @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "thus we can get the whole space of exceptional locus by deforming the point @xmath97 and patching the affine pieces .",
    "we will see a concrete example in the following section . here",
    "we would like to make one remark as a corollary :    for @xmath5-type simple singularities , all @xmath161 affine charts can be described by @xmath161 young diagrams of type @xmath162 .    in @xmath5 case ,",
    "@xmath109 is always @xmath0-invariant , hence @xmath163 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath161 @xmath0-clusters and each of them corresponds to the monomial ideal @xmath164 .",
    "first , we recall the toric resolution of cyclic quotient singularities because the quotient space @xmath71 is a toric variety .",
    "let @xmath165 be the 2-dimensional real vector space , @xmath166 its standard base , @xmath110 the lattice generated by @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 , where the summation runs over all the elements @xmath170 , and @xmath171 the naturally defined rational convex polyhedral cone in @xmath172 .",

    "* fact 2 * if @xmath183 is the corresponding torus embedding , then @xmath184 is non - singular .",
    "thus , we obtain the minimal resolution @xmath185",
    ". moreover , each lattice point of the newton boundary corresponds to an exceptional divisor .",
    "* example * let us look at the example of the cyclic quotient singularity of type @xmath186 which is generated by the matrix @xmath187 where @xmath188 .",
    "the toric resolution of this quotient singularity is given by the triangulation of the lattice @xmath189 with the lattice points : see figure  [ fig : toric ] .      from this newton polytope , we can see that there are 3 exceptional divisors and the dual graph gives the configuration of the exceptional components with a deformed coordinate from the original coordinate @xmath190 on @xmath42 as in figure  [ fig : dual ] .",
    "therefore we have 4 affine pieces in this example and we have 4 coordinate systems corresponding to each affine piece . in this picture , we will see the corresponding special irreducible representations , but we would like to use our method in the previous section to find the representations .",
    "let us draw the diagram which corresponds to the @xmath0-basis and @xmath110-space .",

    "[ fig : bg ] we draw the @xmath110-space as shaded part in @xmath103 .",

    "let us see the meaning of the corresponding @xmath0-clusters in this case . from @xmath101 for ( 2 ) , we obtain an ideal @xmath201 for the origin of the affine chart ( 2 ) in figure  [ fig : dual ] , and the corresponding representations are @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath13 . if we take the maximal ideal @xmath78 of @xmath204 corresponding to the origin @xmath80 , then we have @xmath205 similarly we have the ideal @xmath206 and @xmath207 these descriptions coincide with the results of theorem  [ th : akira ] for a point at the intersection @xmath208 .    for any other points @xmath97 on the exceptional component @xmath4",
    ", we must have @xmath209 in fact , we can see that a point on the exceptional divisor @xmath210 in this example was determined by the ratio @xmath211 , that is , the corresponding ideal of a point on @xmath210 can be described as @xmath212 .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath213 gives the coordinate of the exceptional curve ( @xmath214 ) and we also have @xmath215 .",
    "we discussed special mckay correspondence in 2-dimensional case in this paper . in dimension three , it is convenient to consider crepant resolutions as minimal resolutions and we have a much more complicated situation . even in the case",
    "@xmath36 , we have @xmath216 in general .",
    "of course we can use the same definition for the special representations in the higher dimensional case , but all non - trivial irreducible representations of @xmath36 are special . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of the exceptional divisors is less than that of the non - trivial irreducible representations .",
    "therefore , it looks very difficult to generalize this special mckay correspondence .",
    "that is , we should make a difference , say a kind of the grading , in the set of the special ( or non - trivial ) representations like age \" of the conjugacy classes .    however , there are good news : in 2000 , craw @xcite constructed a cohomological mckay correspondence for the @xmath0-hilbert schemes where @xmath0 is an abelian group , and in this correspondence we can see the 2-dimensional special mckay correspondence .",
    "and recently , the author found a way to obtain a polytope which corresponds to the 3-dimensional @xmath0-hilbert schemes for abelian subgroups in @xmath217 by combinatorics .",
