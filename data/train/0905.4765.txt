    "the problem of fast magnetic reconnection in collisionless or weakly collisional plasmas has become a subject of great interest in recent years , in large part due to its relevance to impulsive phenomena such as magnetospheric substorms , solar and stellar flares , and the sawtooth crash in tokamaks .",
    "a key development has been the realization that non - ideal terms in the generalized ohm s law ( including electron inertia , electron pressure gradient , and hall terms ) provide a pathway to the onset of fast reconnection .",
    "this subject has a history spanning nearly two decades , with important contributions from both the fusion and space plasma communities ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the hall term in particular plays a key role in localizing the electron diffusion region . within the framework of hall mhd ( or two - fluid ) studies ,",
    "there has been consensus on this point , though the issue of reconnection scaling has remained controversial .",
    "some studies of reconnection in hall mhd systems have reported a `` universal '' normalized reconnection rate of @xmath2 , independent of dissipation mechanism @xcite , or system size@xcite .",
    "however , other studies@xcite have found a broad range of dependencies on plasma parameters such as the ion skin and electron skin depths , and on boundary conditions , appearing to refute the claim of universality .    in an interesting sequence of studies based on fully kinetic simulations employing particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods  @xcite ,",
    "questions have been raised regarding the conclusion , obtained from hall mhd studies , that the electron diffusion region is highly localized . in these pic studies",
    "the electron diffusion region is not so localized .",
    "rather it is elongated in the outflow direction to lengths on the order of @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the ion skin depth ) for electron to ion mass ratios of the order of @xmath5 , when hall mhd simulations produce localized ( @xmath6 length ) electron current sheets ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this raises the following interesting question : are fully kinetic simulations necessary to produce elongated electron current sheets ? more specifically , is it possible to realize elongated electron current sheets within the framework of hall or extended mhd models by means of a generalized ohm s law that includes additional closure terms and parameterizes physical processes that may have kinetic origin ?",
    "if the answer to this question is yes , it may facilitate greatly the capability of global multi - fluid models to represent the effects of kinetic physics at small scales .    a recent study by chacn et al . @xcite presented scaling arguments and simulation results which indicated that in 2d electron mhd ( emhd ) systems with electron viscosity ( hyper - resistivity ) , the electron dissipation region can take on a wide range of geometries ; the governing equations permit the aspect ratio ( width / length ) of the electron dissipation region to be of order unity ( cusp like ) or much smaller , i.e. , leading to an extended electron current sheet . in the present work , we re - derive chacn s emhd scaling in perhaps a more transparent way , via sweet - parker type arguments about quantities at the upstream and downstream edges of the electron dissipation region .",
    "similar approaches have been employed recently by malyshkin  @xcite , and also by uzdensky @xcite .",
    "these scaling results are then benchmarked numerically by two - fluid simulations of island coalescence both with and without electron inertia .",
    "we emphasize that neither this study , nor any other to date has produced a general method for analytically predicting the length of the dissipation region , which is perhaps the most important factor in determining whether the reconnection in a given system is fast or slow .",
    "we show , in particular , that the length of the electron diffusion region can not be simply assumed to be a parameter fixed only by external boundary conditions , but depends on the mechanism that breaks the frozen - in condition ( electron viscosity in this case ) .",

    "note that of these non - ideal terms , only the hyper - resistive term is dissipative .",

    "the density reaches a maximum value of @xmath57 in the center of the simulation domain @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "initially the current is carried entirely by the ions . to prevent energy buildup at the grid scale ,",
    "the simulations include fourth order dissipation in the density and momentum equations of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "to avoid physically artificial effects that can arise from exact reflection symmetries of the initial condition , a small amount of random noise is added to the magnetic field and ion current at the levels @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "this initial equilibrium configuration contains four magnetic islands .",
    "diagonally adjacent islands contain ( out - of - plane ) currents of like sign and are therefore mutually attracted .",
    "the islands with currents of opposite sign are of course mutually repelled . at rest these attractions and repulsions balance so that the equilibrium is metastable : either the upper right and lower left islands can coalesce at the center of the simulation domain , or the upper left and lower right islands can do so .",
    "due to the symmetry of this system , whichever pair coalesces at the center , the opposite pair of islands will be repelled from the center coalescing at one of the corners of the simulation box .",
    "the symmetry of this metastable state is broken by giving the system an initial incompressible in - plane velocity perturbation of the form : @xmath64.\\ ] ] unless otherwise stated , the magnitude of this initial velocity is @xmath65 in normalized units .",
    "in systems where the hall term is important , the non - ideal region takes on a two - scale structure : an outer region where the ions are demagnetized but the electrons are still frozen in , and an inner region where the electrons are demagnetized as well .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the outer part of the non - ideal region , although the ions are demagnetized , there is no dissipation occurring there .",
    "here we will refer to this outer , non - dissipative zone as the `` hall region . ''",
    "the inner , dissipative region , where neither species is magnetized , and where ( in our case ) electron viscosity is the dominant term , will be referred to as the `` electron diffusion region . ''",
    "let @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denote the thickness and length of the electron diffusion region , respectively .    in the following scaling arguments we neglect the effects of electron inertia , which is valid when the smallest scale of interest is much larger than the electron inertial length , @xmath68 .",
    "we also suppose that the spatial scale of the electron dissipation region is small sufficiently small compared to the ion inertial length , @xmath69 , so that ion motion may be neglected . in other words",
    ", we consider an emhd model . in the regime where the above conditions are met , the dominant terms on the right hand side of the generalized ohm s law ( eq .  ( [ ohm ] ) ) are the hall ( proportional to @xmath70 ) term , and the hyper - resistive term ( proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "let us consider the how these two terms conspire to influence the geometry of the electron region .",
    "note that the arguments made here are very similar to those made by uzdensky in a recently submitted paper  @xcite .",
    "from this point on we will work in a co - ordinate system rotated 45 degrees clockwise ( @xmath72 ) with respect to the system coordinates described in section  ( [ initial equilibrium ] ) , so that we call the inflow direction `` @xmath73 '' and the outflow direction `` @xmath74 '' . in the case under consideration , there are two forces acting on the electrons as they flow away from the x - point : the @xmath70 force accelerates the electrons away from the x - point along the @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions in a channel of width @xmath76 , while the hyper - resistive ( electron viscosity ) term resists the shear in the electron fluid caused by the localized outflow .",
    "the peak electron outflow in steady state occurs at the point where these two opposing forces balance .",
    "this balancing of terms at the point of peak outflow is found to be well satisfied in our simulation results . here",
    "we will take the half length @xmath77 of the layer to be the distance from the x - point / stagnation point to the location of peak electron outflow .",
    "let @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 denote the magnetic field , electron outflow velocity , and out - of - plane current density at the point @xmath81 .",
    "then we have @xmath82 where the approximation that @xmath83 holds provided that @xmath84 . between the inner and outer region ,",
    "the electrons move at the @xmath85 drift speed .",
    "so , at the downstream edge of the electron region , @xmath86 . in steady state , @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 is spatially uniform .",

    "we must emphasize here the quantity @xmath98 is independent of the mass of either species .",
    "the present scaling arguments are essentially emhd arguments , and as such there is no finite @xmath69 . in the absence of electron inertia",
    ", there is also no @xmath68 in an emhd model .",
    "uniformity of @xmath88 holds _ across _ the electron current sheet as well , requiring @xmath99 finally , taking the plasma to be incompressible ( rigorously valid in the emhd limit ) , requires that @xmath100 , we can solve for @xmath101 , and @xmath88 in terms of @xmath102 , and @xmath67 : @xmath103 equation  ( [ delta_scaling ] ) predicts exactly the same scaling as that found by chacn et al .",
    "( compare to eq .",

    "however , as in that study , the length of the electron dissipation region remains as a free parameter .",
    "this scaling permits ( as stated by chacn ) both cases in which @xmath104 , or @xmath105 .",
    "however , this statement may lead one to believe that there exists a bifurcated solution , which permits only the two aforementioned scalings .",
    "in fact , neither the arguments presented here nor those made in refs .  @xcite or @xcite places",
    "any limit on the scaling of @xmath67 , thus failing to answer the question of whether the reconnection in any given system will be fast or slow .",

    "the reconnection rate given in eq .",
    "( [ ez_scaling ] ) is not explicitly dependent on @xmath106 , but may implicitly depend on @xmath106 , depending on how @xmath67 scales .",
    "several limitations of the above scaling arguments are worth noting .",
    "first , the theory has assumed that ion motion is negligible on the spatial and temporal scale of the reconnection process .",
    "second , the effects of electron inertia have been neglected .",
    "third , electron pressure gradients have been assumed to be negligible , largely for the sake of simplicity ; on scales @xmath107 , electron pressure gradients are generally expected to be of the same order as the @xmath70 term , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ohm ] ) .",
    "the first two of these points limit the applicability of these arguments to scales @xmath108 that satisfy the condition @xmath109 .",
    "a further , more subtle point , which was mentioned above , is that the downstream force balance criterion may not hold in all cases .",
    "however , even if there is no downstream force balance , the same scalings can be derived by enforcing steady state of the 2d emhd equation . in two dimensions ,",
    "the magnetic field can be expressed without loss of generality as @xmath110 . in this case , the in plane and out - of - plane components of the emhd equation can be expressed ( in normalized form ) as : @xmath111 in steady state , again taking @xmath112 , these two equations become : @xmath113 and eliminating @xmath114 from these two equations , again yields : @xmath115 , the same scaling given by eq .",
    "( [ delta_scaling ] ) , and equivalent scalings come about for the other quantities as well .",
    "this approach is perhaps more general , as it does nt require force balance at the downstream edge , though it may be less physically transparent .",
    "a general theory which predicts the length of the dissipation region in collisionless hall mhd is in many ways the ultimate pursuit of all theoretical work on reconnection today , and as of yet no theory has delivered that result , except in special cases   ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
