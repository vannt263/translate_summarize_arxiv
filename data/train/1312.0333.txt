    "the events that trigger a transition of the system state defined in @xcite can be classified into five categories : 1 ) a new call arrival ; 2 ) a handoff user arrival ; 3 ) a handoff user departure ; 4 ) a call termination ; and 5 ) a periodic time - frequency resource conversion . in the following ,",
    "we describe each category case by case .",
    "the important symbols defined in @xcite and re - utilized in this report are summarized in table i.     @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) & wide - band ( narrow - band ) connection & @xmath2 &    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     & @xmath3 +",
    "without loss of generality , take connection @xmath4 of fig . 2 in @xcite as an example .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the call hold time of connection @xmath4 before applying tfrc , and @xmath6 denote the call hold time of the connection successfully resumed full spectrum supply . without loss of generality , we suppose that the spectrum recovery for @xmath4 occurs at the @xmath7 context information feedback . since the data amount of the connection to be delivered remains the same with and without tfrc , we have @xmath8 where the three items of the left side here are referred to as the delivered data amounts of connection @xmath4 in the following three disjointed durations , namely , before the user gives his / her attention to the new connection @xmath9 , until the resource manager detects that the user refocuses on connection @xmath4 , and after the spectrum recovery for the connection . with some manipulation , it is clear that @xmath10 due to a positive value of call hold time , we have @xmath11 . thus , by applying the memoryless property of the exponential distribution , we have @xmath12 which implies that given exponential distribution for the call hold time ( @xmath13 ) of a connection without applying tfrc , as long as connection @xmath4 is successfully recovered",
    ", its call holding time after spectrum recovery ( @xmath14 ) follows the same distribution as the one that has not been applied tfrc ."
