    "jet production in neutral - current ( nc ) and charged - current ( cc ) deep inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( dis ) provides a test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations and of the electroweak sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "jet cross sections allow the determination of one of the fundamental parameters of qcd , the strong coupling constant @xmath1 , and help to constrain the parton densities in the proton .",
    "new particles or interactions may be observed by deviations of the measured jet cross sections with respect to the predictions .    up to leading order ( lo ) in @xmath1 , jet production in nc and cc",
    "dis proceeds via the quark - parton model ( qpm ) ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , boson - gluon fusion ( bgf ) ( @xmath6 ) and qcd - compton ( qcdc ) ( @xmath7 ) processes ( see figure  [ one ] ) .    (",
    "18.0,5.5 ) ( 0.0,0.5 ) ( 2.0,0.3)(a ) ( 7.5,0.3)(b ) ( 14.0,0.3)(c )    the jet production cross section is given in pqcd by the convolution of the parton densities in the proton and the subprocess cross section , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fraction of the proton momentum taken by the interacting parton , @xmath10 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the proton , @xmath11 is the factorisation scale , @xmath12 is the subprocess cross section and @xmath13 is the renormalisation scale .",
    "the proton pdfs are determined from global fits to experimental data ( see e.g. @xcite ) and parametrise the long - distance structure of the target hadron .",
    "the subprocess cross section is calculable in pqcd at any order and represents the short - distance structure of the interaction .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 from measurements of cross sections in dis depends on the proton pdfs .",
    "thus , to perform a qcd analysis , a functional form of the pdfs must be assumed and the determination of @xmath1 should be made from observables with a small dependence on the pdfs , e.g. ratios of observables .",
    "for precise measurements of @xmath1 , the experimental and theoretical uncertainties should be small .",
    "small experimental uncertainties are obtained by measuring e.g. ratios of observables and the theoretical uncertainties are reduced by including next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the cross section calculations .",
    "several programs are available to make nlo qcd calculations of jet cross sections in dis : disent @xcite , mepjet @xcite , disaster++ @xcite and nlojet @xcite . the nlo corrections include virtual corrections with internal particle loops and real corrections with a third parton in the final state .",
    "the programs differ in the treatment of the real corrections : disent , disaster++ and nlojet use the subtraction method whereas mepjet uses the phase space slicing method .",
    "disent and disaster++ are found to agree at the @xmath14 level , and nlojet is in good agreement with them .",
    "mepjet agrees well with the other programs at lo , but presents differences of the order of @xmath15 at nlo .",
    "mepjet is the only program that includes @xmath4 and @xmath16 exchange and only disaster++ allows the possibility to turn on the number of active flavours as a function of the scale .",
    "the calculation of jet cross sections at nlo in dis depends on two scales , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "two possible choices for these scales that have been considered in the analyses presented here are @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the virtuality of the exchanged boson , and the jet transverse energy , @xmath19 .",
    "since the nlo qcd calculations are for jets of partons and the measurements are done at the hadron level , the calculations need to be corrected for hadronisation effects .",
    "these effects have been estimated using monte carlo models for parton radiation and hadronisation @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the qcd calculations include that due to terms beyond nlo , which is usually estimated by varying the renormalisation scale by factors between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; it amounts to @xmath22 and translates into @xmath23 in the determination of @xmath24 .",
    "the uncertainties on the value of @xmath24 and of the proton pdfs amount to @xmath25 .",
    "the size and uncertainty of the hadronisation corrections have been taken into account : the hadronisation correction factor amounts to @xmath25 with an uncertainty of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "the use of inclusive jet cross sections in a qcd analysis presents several advantages : inclusive jet cross sections are infrared insensitive and better suited to test resummed calculations and the theoretical uncertainties are smaller than for dijet cross sections .",
    "inclusive jet cross sections in nc interactions have been measured @xcite in the breit frame using the @xmath26 cluster algorithm @xcite in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode for the kinematic region of @xmath27 2 , where @xmath18 is the virtuality of the exchanged boson .",

    "this behaviour can be interpreted as due to the presence of a massive propagator in cc events , as it has already been observed in measurements of the @xmath18 dependence of the inclusive cc dis cross section @xcite .",
