    "since the discovery of black holes whose event horizons have nontrivial topology @xcite there has been much research activity in this area .",
    "charged versions of these black holes were presented in @xcite , and also rotating generalizations are known @xcite .",
    "moreover , they also exist in dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "mann @xcite and lemos @xcite showed that topological black holes can form by gravitational collapse .",
    "finally , from a thermodynamical point of view , they are well  behaved objects obeying the entropy ",
    "area law @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we want to investigate questions such as particle production by the black holes , and their equilibrium state , the israel  hartle  hawking quantum state familiar in the schwarzschild case @xcite .",
    "as the local temperature of the black holes is zero at infinity due to a diverging lapse function ( infinite redshift ) , it is possible that there is no net flux of radiated particles at infinity , and that therefore no unruh  like states exist .",
    "+ we will show that this is indeed the case , and that one can define equilibrium thermal states .",
    "part of the interest in doing so is one important feature that distinguishes anti  de sitter from asymptotically flat black holes , namely the asymptotic behaviour at infinity .",
    "the timelike character of the boundary of the space manifests itself in the black hole spacetime by making the exterior static region non  globally hyperbolic .",
    "this is remedied by imposing boundary conditions at spacelike infinity @xcite , to prevent radiation from escaping out . as a result",
    ", the particles emitted by the black hole will be ultimately recaptured back and the black hole evolution will not be complete evaporation .",
    "hence one suspects that the final state should be a thermal equilibrium state , implying a maximum of information loss .",
    "+ in fact , one can imagine a pure state collapsing in anti ",
    "de sitter space to end into a mixture with the largest entropy available .",
    "of course , this is due to infinity in anti  de sitter acting like a boundary , which seems a rather artificial situation .",
    "however , it is an important matter of principle showing that gravity can imply information loss , since now there is no point for the information to return , apart from the existence of white holes @xcite . +",
    "another point of interest is the discrete quantization of the one  particle energies in anti  de sitter space . when a black hole is present , this is no longer true and a continuous spectrum appears .",
    "the density of states is then blue shifted to infinity near the horizon , so one can not explain the black hole entropy as resulting from entangled states , without invoking a short distance cut  off @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "+ finally , there is the question of the black hole mass spectrum in the spirit of bekenstein @xcite . to match with the euclidean partition function , we obtain a mass spectrum @xmath0 , which seems to be difficult to conciliate with string theory . however , recently the entropy of three and five  dimensional anti ",
    "de sitter black holes has been explained by string theory @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the agreement between entropy and the degeneracy of states in a conformal field theory @xcite realizing the asymptotic symmetries of three  dimensional anti  de sitter gravity @xcite .",
    "these important new developments may have an impact on the more difficult four  dimensional case .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is structured as follows : + we begin in section ( ii ) by presenting the geometry of the problem .",
    "+ in section ( iii ) we consider massless scalar fields and weyl spinors propagating in a two  dimensional black hole background .",
    "the boulware , unruh , and hartle  hawking vacua are defined .",
    "we then calculate the renormalized stress tensor for the three states and show that in the hartle  hawking case it indeed describes a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "furthermore we will see that , unlike the schwarzschild black hole , the unruh and the hartle  hawking states coincide , and that this can be traced back to the boundary conditions which have to be imposed at infinity , as our spacetime fails to be globally hyperbolic . though the absence of a true unruh state in its original meaning , we show that a black hole luminosity can be defined in a certain sense , and calculate it using the bogoljubov coefficients relating the unruh and the boulware vacuum . + in section ( iv )",
    "we consider the more complicated four  dimensional case , in which backscattering is present .",
    "we argue that the most likely final state is a thermal israel  hartle  hawking state .",
    "this implies information loss .",
    "+ in section ( v ) we address the question of the mass spectrum from the simple perspective of bekenstein  mukhanov arguments .",
    "we discuss this spectrum from the susskind  horowitz ",
    "polchinski point of view and we point out the difficulty to explain the black hole entropy with it , at least naively . at last , our results will be summarized and discussed in section ( vi ) .",
    "+ in this paper we shall use the curvature conventions of hawking ",
    "ellis book @xcite and employ planck s dimensionless units .",
    "all black hole metrics we shall consider are of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the metric of a constant curvature riemann surface with genus @xmath3 , denoted @xmath4 . for @xmath5 we shall take this metric to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 ranges over the closed unit square @xmath8\\times[0,1]$ ] . the element @xmath9 is known as the teichmller parameter of the torus . the lapse @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cosmological constant . denoting with @xmath13 the position of the horizon ( the outermost zero of the lapse ) ,",
    "the surface gravity of the black holes is @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath5 respectively . as will be seen",
    ", the quantity @xmath16 is the hawking temperature of the black hole . + for @xmath15 , the parameter @xmath17 is related to the mass of the black hole by @xmath18 , and for @xmath5 by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the positivity condition for the mass means that the solutions have a black hole interpretation for @xmath20 , the other values giving naked singularities or extreme black holes , in general .",
    "+ the reason for this connection between the adm mass and the parameter @xmath17 , in the higher genus case , can be understood by finding the zero temperature state . for a toroidal black hole ,",
    "the temperature vanishes precisely when @xmath21 , but in the @xmath15 case , the zero temperature state has @xmath22 .",
    "this represents an extremal black hole , where the cauchy inner horizon has merged with the event horizon , and is to be considered as the ground state .",
    "+ the euclidean section of the extreme state can be identified to any period , without introducing conical singularities at the origin .",
    "we may then compute the euclidean action of a black hole relative to the extreme state , and define the mass as the thermal energy in the canonical ensemble corresponding to the hawking temperature .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , this yields @xmath23 this mass is an increasing function of @xmath24 in the full range @xmath25 , with a large-@xmath24 behaviour @xmath26 .",
    "any other choice for the background gives a negative contribution to the entropy of the black hole , because one can not identify the solution and the background with the same temperature without introducing conical singularities , except for the extreme state .",
    "in other words , one can not shift the mass and leave unaffected the entropy at the same time .",
    "+ by expressing the mass in ( [ mass ] ) in terms of @xmath17 , one finds the relation we started with , @xmath27 .",
    "one can also show that this is precisely the on - shell value of the hamiltonian , relative to the zero temperature state .",
    "+ let us restrict our considerations to the case @xmath5 , i.  e.  to the torus .",
    "the generalization to @xmath28 can be done in a straightforward way , if the parameter @xmath29 is positive .",
    "the fact that @xmath17 can become negative in the higher genus case , and an inner horizon forms for @xmath30 , has many implications for the results we will obtain , but will not affect the discussion of the hawking radiation perceived by an external observer .",
    "instead , global classical and quantum properties , such as global hyperbolicity and the existence of the hartle - hawking state , will be affected heavily . throughout this paper",
    ", we will indicate the modifications of our results in the @xmath15 case at the appropriate places .",
    "for our subsequent discussion it will be convenient to introduce several other coordinate systems .",
    "first of all , define the so  called tortoise coordinate @xmath31 by @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the location of the event horizon and the integration constant is chosen so that @xmath34 for @xmath35 . then introduce retarded / advanced null coordinates @xmath36 according to @xmath37 in these coordinates the line element reads @xmath38 finally , kruskal coordinates @xmath39",
    "are defined by @xmath40 with @xmath41 given by ( [ surfgrav ] ) . in kruskal",
    "coordinates we obtain for the metric @xmath42 which is regular on the horizon .",
    "figure [ torus ] shows the conformal diagram of the spacetime . + it is an important fact that the solutions so far discussed may appear as a result of gravitational collapse of a configuration of pressureless dust @xcite . the exterior metric matches with an interior robertson  walker spacetime , and complete collapse occurs in a finite amount of co  moving time . the fact that the exterior metric is given by ( [ metri ] ) at all times results from a generalization of birkhoff s theorem @xcite .",
    "in our two  dimensional toy model we forget the part @xmath43 in ( [ metri ] ) , i.  e.  we limit the calculations to the toroidal analogue of the spherical s  wave sector .",
    "this restriction `` does not throw out the baby with the water '' , as expressed a.  strominger @xcite .",
    "indeed , we shall see that most of the essential features are present in this model . in two dimensions",
    ", there is no backscattering , the metric is conformally flat , and the klein  gordon or the weyl equation can be solved exactly . +      since the metric is conformally flat , the klein ",
    "gordon equation for a massless field @xmath44 is just the same as in minkowski space , namely @xmath45 which has the general solution @xmath46 @xmath47 are arbitrary functions . now in the unruh model @xcite of an evaporating schwarzschild black hole , one defines e.  g.  a complete set of boulware modes by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which means that we have neither particles incoming from past infinity nor particles outgoing to future infinity in the corresponding vacuum state .",
    "analogously , hartle  hawking ( hh ) modes are defined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.  e.  the hartle  hawking vacuum does not contain kruskal particles emerging from the white hole horizon @xmath52 or crossing the future horizon @xmath53 .",
    "finally , unruh modes are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "now this procedure is no more possible in the case of topological black holes .",
    "the penrose diagram in figure [ torus ] shows that the spacetime is not globally hyperbolic ; in order to obtain a well  posed cauchy problem we have to impose boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "there are three natural choices of boundary conditions at @xmath56 ( which is equivalent to @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) : @xmath59_{r = \\infty } & = & 0 \\qquad \\mbox{(robin ) } \\label{bound}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 denotes the unit normal to the surface @xmath56 , and @xmath61 is a function which will be given below . obviously the above  defined functions for the schwarzschild case do not fulfil any of the boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "therefore we define the boulware modes to be @xmath62 where the minus ( plus ) sign corresponds to dirichlet ( neumann ) boundary conditions . for robin boundary conditions we take @xmath63 with @xmath64 . here",
    "the function @xmath61 is simply a constant which equals @xmath65 .",
    "the limit cases @xmath66 @xmath67 represent neumann ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions . the modes ( [ bmodes ] ) , ( [ bmodesr ] )",
    "form a complete orthonormal set with respect to the klein ",
    "gordon scalar product @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a spacelike hypersurface with unit normal @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the induced volume element on @xmath69 .",
    "thus we have @xmath72 we can then expand the field in terms of the boulware modes @xmath73 the boulware vacuum @xmath74 is now determined by @xmath75 we define unruh modes according to @xmath76 the + /-",
    "again denoting neumann / dirichlet boundary conditions respectively . for robin boundary conditions",
    "we have @xmath77 with @xmath64 and @xmath78 .",
    "the modes ( [ umodes ] ) , ( [ umodesr ] ) resemble the solutions of the moving mirror problem ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the infinity @xmath58 can be viewed as a moving mirror @xmath79 , and a positive frequency wave @xmath80 outgoing from the past horizon is reflected by the mirror and becomes a wave @xmath81 travelling towards @xmath53 .",
    "+ on the past horizon @xmath82 only the first summand of ( [ umodes ] ) survives , since the second oscillates infinitely fast , and hence does not give any contribution if one constructs wave packets .",
    "the functions ( [ umodes ] ) , ( [ umodesr ] ) represent again a complete orthogonal system , i.  e.  they satisfy @xmath83 one can also expand the field in terms of unruh modes @xmath84 finally we define the unruh vacuum @xmath85 by @xmath86 obviously @xmath85 does not contain particles emerging from the past horizon .",
    "last , hartle  hawking modes are given by @xmath87 for robin boundary conditions we take an expression corresponding to ( [ umodesr ] ) .",
    "if one constructs wave packets , only the first term of ( [ hhmodes ] ) gives a contribution on the future horizon @xmath88 .",
    "the hartle  hawking vacuum @xmath89 is defined by the usual procedure , analogous to the two preceding cases .",
    "@xmath89 does not contain particles crossing the future horizon , but there are also no particles emerging from the white hole , as we shall see later by investigating the renormalized stress tensor .",
    "+ note that in contrast to two  dimensional ads space , where the spectrum is discrete @xcite , in our case we have a continuous frequency spectrum .",
    "this will also hold true in four dimensions ( see section [ 4d ] ) .",
    "it should not be surprising , because our spacetime is only asymptotically locally ads , and one boundary condition at @xmath58 clearly does not cause a discrete spectrum .",
    "let us now devote attention to weyl fermions propagating in the black hole background .",
    "this case presents no particular difficulties , but there are also significant differences .",
    "the weyl equation in a two  dimensional curved spacetime enjoys the conformal invariance on the same footing of the massless klein - gordon equation .",
    "we introduce a zweibein field @xmath90 , deserving the latin indices @xmath91 to denote local lorentz tensors and @xmath92 to denote coordinate tensor components , and the two  dimensional dirac matrices @xmath93 . then given a pair",
    "@xmath94 consisting of a metric tensor and a weyl spinor satisfying the weyl equation @xmath95 the transformed pair @xmath96 , @xmath97 , will also satisfy the weyl equation in the metric @xmath98 . in both coordinate systems we have employed so far , the retarded / advanced system @xmath99 and the kruskal system @xmath100 , the metric is conformal to a flat one of the form @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "the weyl equation for such flat metrics splits into a pair of decoupled equations for the positive / negative chirality spinors , @xmath103 , which read @xmath104 with identical equations in the @xmath100-system . in string terminology , @xmath105 is left moving and @xmath106 is right moving .",
    "the spinor in spacetime can now be obtained multiplying the flat @xmath103 with the respective conformal factors .",
    "+ normalizable , positive frequency solutions of ( [ weyl ] ) in the interval @xmath107 are given by @xmath108 there is no question to impose dirichlet or other boundary conditions here , because the weyl equations fix a unique form to the positive frequency modes . indeed , that dirichlet boundary conditions on the dirac equation lead to inconsistencies has long been known , as a consequence of the first order character of the equation .",
    "note however that for the given solutions , the component of the conserved dirac current along the normal to the boundary at infinity , namely @xmath109 evaluated at @xmath110 , vanishes identically .",
    "this is a much more weaker boundary condition than dirichlet or neumann , allowing to find non  trivial solutions . in the kruskal frame , we take advantage from the fact that both horizons are cauchy surfaces for weyl spinors in anti - de sitter space .",
    "the normalization measure is @xmath111 along the past sheet of the horizon , and @xmath112 along the future sheet , so normalizable solutions are @xmath113 we shall use these to compute the relevant bogoljubov coefficients in the next but one section .",
    "we now wish to determine the expectation value of the stress tensor @xmath114 for the unruh , the hartle ",
    "hawking , and the boulware vacuum state ( see @xcite for a readable account ) .",
    "now , it is well known @xcite that ( [ stress ] ) is mathematically ill  defined , involving products of two distributions on spacetime .",
    "therefore some kind of regularization procedure is needed , e.  g.  a point  splitting method .",
    "we follow here the lines of davies and fulling @xcite , who presented in detail the renormalization theory of the stress tensor of a two  dimensional massless scalar field , including boundary conditions .",

    "+ in coordinates @xmath129 we have @xmath130 which behaves on the horizon as @xmath131 this behaviour is similar to that of the stress tensor in the boulware state for the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "there it diverges like @xmath132 in four dimensions , our exponent @xmath133 instead of @xmath134 stems from the reduction to two dimensions .",
    "+ the energy density @xmath135 in the boulware state , measured by a killing observer with four  velocity @xmath136 ( i.  e.  at constant @xmath137 ) , is given for large @xmath137 by @xmath138 this represents the casimir energy of the state , resulting from the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "the `` would be '' divergence for @xmath35 ( i.  e.  on the boundary ) is a well  known behaviour of the casimir energy , but here it is cancelled by the growing of the lapse at infinity .",
    "later we shall see that in the hh state there is an additional term in the expression for @xmath135 , coming from black hole radiation . + let us now focus our attention on the hartle  hawking state .",
    "first of all , note that the formulas given in @xcite for the renormalized stress tensor are only valid for time ",
    "independent boundary conditions with respect to @xmath139 .",
    "this is not the case here .",
    "therefore we must introduce new coordinates @xmath140 , @xmath141 . in these coordinates the boundary @xmath58",
    "is located at @xmath142 , i.  e.  at @xmath143 .",
    "reexpressing @xmath144 in kruskal coordinates after the calculation , one gets @xmath145 where we have defined @xmath146 now near the horizon we have @xmath147 , cancelling the divergence of the prefactor , therefore @xmath148 is well  defined everywhere . + here",
    "a new feature arises in the higher genus case for @xmath30 , i.  e.  when an inner horizon forms .",
    "using the @xmath15 expression for @xmath10 in ( [ w ] ) , and transforming the stress tensor to coordinates in which the metric is regular at the inner horizon @xmath149 , one finds a divergence of the stress tensor at @xmath150 .",
    "having adjusted the quantum state of the scalar field so that the stress tensor is finite at the outer horizon , it diverges at the inner horizon .",
    "this behaviour is identical to what has been found in two dimensions for a reissner  nordstrm black hole @xcite , and is related to an infinite frequency blue - shift occurring on the cauchy horizon .",
    "this suggests that there is no hartle  hawking equilibrium state , and that strong back reaction effects take place near the inner horizon . in two dimensions , however , a semiclassical calculation shows that this last sentence is not true , in the sense that the singularity appearing at the horizon is very mild @xcite .",
    "+ let us now return to the toroidal black hole .",
    "we observe that the @xmath151component of the energy current four ",
    "vector @xmath152 , measured by an `` observer '' with four  velocity @xmath153 on the past  horizon , namely @xmath154 vanishes on @xmath155 .",
    "therefore @xmath89 does not contain kruskal particles emerging from the white hole , as already pointed out in the previous section .",

    "the integrand @xmath169 is zero , hence the incoming null flux through the constant @xmath137 surface equals the outgoing , and @xmath89 represents indeed a thermal equilibrium state with the hawking temperature .",

    "we also infer that the radiation temperature of the black hole is @xmath182 , in accordance with the temperature found in the euclidean formulation @xcite . + note that , in order to obtain the `` luminosity '' , it would have been sufficient to calculate the bogoljubov coefficients relating an outgoing mode @xmath183 to the modes @xmath184 .",
    "this yields the same bogoljubov coefficients as above , which can be understood as follows : the monochromatic components @xmath185 in the expansion of the outgoing mode @xmath183 are reflected at the boundary , becoming ingoing modes @xmath186 .",
    "these give the expansion of the reflected wave in kruskal coordinates , namely of @xmath187 .",
