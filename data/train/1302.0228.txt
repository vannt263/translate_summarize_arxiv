    "[ arm_reflection ] .",
    "however , if the direct received wave is in the direction of the null of the receive antenna , it will not contribute to the received power .",

    "it could be seen that a good agreement between the simulations and the analytical model is obtained .",
    "some differences might occur due to the fact that the torso is not completely elliptical in shape .",
    "variations in the antenna gain at different positions may also contribute to these differences  @xcite .",

    "the value of the gain used in the analytical equation is @xmath114 dbi which is the gain of the antenna in the direction of the creeping wave at the central abdomen position .",
    "more discussion about the usage of the gain of the on - body antenna for the creeping wave can be found in  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "it is critical to include the effect of the arms while estimating the link loss because the reflected waves from the arms at a intended receiver position might interfere destructively with the on - body creeping waves .",
    "hence , the link loss at that receiver position will be higher than the link loss obtained without considering the effect of the arms . for eg .",
    ", let us consider a case when the receiver is placed midway between position @xmath115 and position @xmath116 .",

    "[ s21_var ] , shows the variation of @xmath112 at the different receiver positions for different arm positions calculated using  ( [ rx_pwr_elliptical_reflection ] ) .",
    "the worst case link loss for this case is about @xmath128 db whereas it is @xmath129 db without considering the reflections from the arms .",
    "hence , it is important to consider the link loss with the arms for a reliable link .     at different rx positions for different arm positions ]",

    "the model was validated through the full - wave simulations .",
    "it was shown that the reflection of the waves from the arms at some receiver positions around the torso resulted in a higher link loss than for a case without the arms .",
