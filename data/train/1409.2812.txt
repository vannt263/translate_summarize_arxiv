    "when presupposing zero variation in transversal direction ( see figure  [ memsfig ] ) , the stationary problem can be described as finding the plate deflection @xmath0 on the interval @xmath1 according to @xmath2 along with the electrostatic potential @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 in the region @xmath5 between the two plates . in equation , the fourth - order term @xmath6 with @xmath7 reflects plate bending while the linear second - order term @xmath8 with @xmath9 and the non - local second - order term @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 account for external stretching and self - stretching forces generated by large oscillations , respectively .",

    "the boundary conditions mean that the elastic plate is clamped .",
    "according to - , the electrostatic potential is harmonic in the region @xmath15 enclosed by the two plates with value  1 on the elastic plate and value  0 on the ground plate .",
    "we refer the reader e.g. to @xcite and the references therein for more details on the derivation of the model .",
    "a crucial feature of the model is the singularity arising in the term @xmath16 of when @xmath17 ( due to @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , i.e. when the elastic plate touches down on the ground plate .",
    "the strength of this instability is in some sense tuned by the parameter @xmath20 and it is thus expected that solutions to - only exist for small values of @xmath20 below a certain threshold . obviously , the stable operating conditions of mems devices and hence the existence of stationary solutions are of utmost importance in applications .",
    "questions related to the pull - in threshold were the focus of a very active research in the recent past , however , almost exclusively dedicated to the simplified _ small gap model _ obtained by formally setting @xmath21 in - .",

    "( ii ) one may employ a nonlinear variant of the eigenfunction method involving a positive eigenfunction in @xmath40 associated to the fourth - order operator @xmath48 subject to the clamped boundary condition .",
