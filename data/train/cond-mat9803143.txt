    "sandpile models have been studied extensively during the last decade as a paradigm of self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "this concept , introduced by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw )  @xcite , stimulated numerous theoretical  @xcite , numerical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "in sandpile models , which are defined on a lattice , grains are deposited randomly until the height at some site exceeds a threshold , and becomes unstable .",
    "grains are then distributed to the nearest neighbors . as a result of this relaxation process neighboring sites",
    "may become unstable , resulting in a cascade of relaxations called _",
    "an avalanche_. it was observed that these models are self - driven into a critical state which is characterized by a set of exponents  @xcite .",
    "this set includes _ distribution exponents _ that describe the distribution of quantities such as avalanche size , area , and lifetime , and the _ geometric exponents _ which relate various properties of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "additional sandpile models which differ from the btw model in the dynamic rules were introduced and studied .",
    "these include the manna model  @xcite , in which the dynamics during an avalanche is stochastic and the zhang model  @xcite , in which the dynamic variable is continuous . in order to understand the basic mechanism of soc",
    ", numerous attempts were made to assign the various models to universality classes . to this end ,",
    "vespignani , zapperi and pietronero introduced the fixed scale transformation which is a real space renormalization group ( rg ) approach  @xcite .",
    "they applied this approach to the btw and manna models and concluded that these two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "later , a comparison between the critical behavior of btw and the manna models was performed , using extensive numerical simulations and an extended set of exponents  @xcite .",
    "the results provide strong evidence that the two models belong to different universality classes .    recently , diaz - guilera and corral applied the dynamic rg technique to study critical behavior in sandpile models .",
    "their conclusion was that the btw and the zhang models belong to the same universality class  @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by lbeck  @xcite , based on numerical simulations .    in this paper",
    "we apply an extended set of tools for the characterization of critical behavior in sandpile models and for their classification into universality classes .",
    "these tools include measures that characterize avalanches as a whole such as the distribution exponents , the geometric exponents and the avalanche structure .",
    "we also introduce a new measure , based on scaling functions , describing the time evolution of the area , size and energy during an avalanche . combining all these tools ,",
    "we find strong indications that the btw , manna and zhang models belong to three different universality classes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the models are introduced in sec .",
    "ii and the measures for their classification are presented in sec .",
    "the simulations and results are given in sec .",
    "iv , followed by a summary and conclusions in sec . v.",
    "sandpile models are defined on a @xmath0 dimensional lattice of linear size @xmath1 .",
    "each site * i * is assigned a dynamic variable @xmath2 which represents some physical quantity such as energy , stress etc . in a critical height model a configuration @xmath3",
    "is called _ stable _ if for all sites @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a threshold value .",
    "the evolution between stable configurations is by the following rules :    \\(i ) adding energy . given a stable configuration @xmath6 we select a site @xmath7 at random and increase @xmath8 by some amount @xmath9 .",
    "when an unstable configuration is reached rule ( ii ) is applied .",
    "\\(ii ) relaxation rule .",
    "if @xmath10 @xmath5 , relaxation takes place and energy is distributed in the following way :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 are a set of ( unit ) vectors from the site @xmath7 to some neighbors . as a result of the relaxation",
    "the dynamic variable in one or more of the neighbors may exceed the threshold .",
    "the relaxation rule is then applied until a stable configuration is reached .",
    "the sequence of relaxations is an avalanche which propagates through the lattice .",
    "it was shown before , that the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath5 are irrelevant to the scaling behavior  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the critical exponents depend only on the vector @xmath13 , to be termed _",
    "relaxation vector_. for a square lattice with relaxation to nearest neighbors ( nn ) it is of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the amounts transferred to the northern , eastern , southern and western nn s respectively . in the btw model , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "if an active site with @xmath20 is toppled , it would not become empty after the topple had occurred . in the zhang model  @xcite , for which @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the relaxation vector is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath8 is the amount of energy in the active site before the topple had occurred .",
    "obviously , the site @xmath7 remains empty after toppling .    in a random relaxation model  @xcite a set of neighbors",
    "is randomly chosen for relaxation .",
    "such a model is specified by a set of relaxation vectors , each vector being assigned a probability for it application .",
    "for example , a possible realization of a two - state model includes six relaxation vectors ( 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 ) and ( 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 ) , each one applied with a probability of @xmath25 .",
    "a four state model would include relaxation vectors such as ( 4 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 3 , 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 2 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 1 ) , etc . , applied at different probabilities while maintaining the four fold symmetry of the relaxation rule . a _ time step _ ( of unit _ time _ ) is defined as the relaxation of all the sites having @xmath26 , after the completion of the previous time step .",
    "a model is said to be _ abelian _ if the configuration after the avalanche , does not depend on the order in which the relaxation of the active sites was performed .",
    "the btw model was shown to be abelian  @xcite .",
    "the manna models  @xcite are not abelian because they contain a random choice of the toppling direction . as a result",
    ", they develop different scenes of toppling that depend on the order of relaxation of the active sites in a single time step .",
    "the zhang model is also non - abelian .",
    "this can be seen from the following example , when two active nn sites are toppled within the same time step .",
    "the site that was toppled last remains empty while the other one is non - empty .",
    "this shows that the final configuration depends on the order .",
    "avalanches have various properties which can be measured in a simulation : size , area , lifetime , linear size , and perimeter .",
    "the size ( @xmath27 ) of an avalanche is the total number of relaxation events that occurred in the course of a single avalanche .",
    "the area ( @xmath28 ) is the number of sites in the lattice where relaxation occurred .",
    "the lifetime ( @xmath29 ) of an avalanche is the number of time steps ( defined above ) that took place during the avalanche . as for the linear size of an avalanche",
    ", one can use the radius of gyration ( @xmath30 ) of the cluster of sites where relaxation occurred .",
    "a site inside the area @xmath28 is defined as a perimeter site if it has a nearest neighbor where no relaxation took place .",
    "the perimeter ( @xmath31 ) is the number of perimeter sites .",
    "thus we have a set of variables @xmath32 which characterize an avalanche .",
    "the avalanche variables have probability functions which are assumed to fall off with a power law defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and the exponents @xmath35 are called _",
    "distribution exponents_. these variables also scale against each other in the form @xmath36 for @xmath37 and the exponents @xmath38 are called _ geometric exponents_. the exact definition of the geometric critical exponents @xmath39 is in terms of conditional expectations values : @xmath40 \\sim x^{\\gamma_{yx}}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the exponents are not independent .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that they satisfy the scaling relations @xmath41 and @xmath42 apart from looking at the critical exponents we have also examined the structural features of the avalanches .",
    "we define on the lattice a function that specifies the number of toppling events , @xmath43 , for each site @xmath7 during a single avalanche . in a two dimensional ( 2d ) model",
    "this function takes the form of a hilly terrain , with discrete heights . the @xmath44th terrace is then defined as the set of sites for which @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this height profile of an avalanche can be described by drawing the area of the @xmath44th terrace , @xmath47 vs. @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , we can consider @xmath47 as an avalanche variable , just like the size or the area .",
    "this gives us new variables that can be measured and compared between the various models .",
    "the avalanche properties introduced so far , such as the area and size , characterize an avalanche as a whole , and are measured only after the avalanche is completed . here",
    "we introduce measures to characterize the time evolution during an avalanche .",
    "measured vs. time , for a single avalanche , these measures exhibit an irregular form .",
    "however , if we average them over a large number of avalanches , a typical shape emerges .",
    "we now introduce three such measures :    1 .   the avalanche area @xmath48 , namely the number of sites where at least one relaxation occurred during the first @xmath29 time steps of the avalanche . as the avalanche",
    "is completed @xmath48 evolves to the area @xmath28 of the avalanche .",
    "we also define @xmath49 as the time derivative of @xmath48 , according to @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the variable @xmath49 gives the number of sites that at time @xmath29 became active for the first time ( and are to be toppled in the next time step ) .",
    "as the avalanche evolves to an end we find that the avalanche area satisfies @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the avalanche time , and the @xmath54 step consists of the deposition event that initiated the avalanche .",
    "2 .   the number of active sites @xmath55 ( namely sites that are to topple in the next time step ) , as a function of time .",
    "as the avalanche evolves to an end we find that @xmath56 is the avalanche size .",
    "3 .   considering a sandpile in a gravitational field , we define the potential energy @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the energy at site @xmath7 given by : @xmath59 the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are irrelevant and we take @xmath62 .",
    "the potential energy defined here , turns out to be proportional to @xmath63 , contrary to the ordinary definition of energy in sandpiles , which is linear in @xmath8 . for the case of a discrete dynamic variable , a site @xmath7 having energy @xmath8 will have a potential energy @xmath64 .    averaging the functions @xmath49 , @xmath55 and @xmath65 over a large number of avalanches we obtain the functions @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "according to the dynamic scaling assumption , each one of these functions can be written in the general scaling form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . the scaling function @xmath72 , where @xmath73 satisfies the sum rules @xmath74 the shape of the scaling function , and the values of the exponents @xmath75",
    "can be used to distinguish between universality classes .",
    "moreover , the relation between these scaling functions can be used as a further tool .",
    "for example , if @xmath72 and @xmath76 coincide for one model and are different in another model , it indicates that these two models do not belong to the same universality class .",
    "the dependence of @xmath77 on the system size @xmath1 is given by @xmath78",
    "having defined the three models and the measures used for their characterization , we now describe the computer simulations .",
    "we have used open boundary conditions and system sizes up to @xmath79 , with @xmath80 to @xmath81 grains dropped , in two dimensions ( 2d ) . for each run we ascertained , before collecting data , that the dynamics has reached the critical state by applying dhar s burning algorithm  @xcite , or by starting with a configuration belonging to the critical state . for each model",
    "we have calculated all the measures of classification mentioned in sec .",
    "the exponent @xmath82 that describes the avalanche size distribution was measured for the btw , manna four - state and zhang models ( fig .",
    "[ taus ] ) finding good agreement with previous results  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath82 for the three models , as a function of the inverse system size , is given in fig .",
    "[ tau_size ] .",
    "these results do not provide a reliable extrapolation of @xmath82 to the infinite system limit .",
    "however , they strongly indicate that the curves converge to different values of @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "as @xmath82 exhibits relatively strong dependence on the system size  @xcite , it can not be used as the primary tool for classification of models , but only to provide additional evidence .",
    "the geometric exponents @xmath39 are only weakly dependent on the system size , and turn out to be very useful for classification of sandpile models  @xcite . in our simulations we examined the exponents @xmath84 and",
    "this was done by drawing on a log - log scale quantities such as the average avalanche size @xmath86 $ ] for a given area @xmath28 , where @xmath87 is given by the slope of the straight line section ( fig .",
    "[ gammah ] ) .",
    "the values of the geometric exponents for the btw and the manna four - state models , are in agreement with previous simulations  @xcite .",
    "our simulations of the zhang model , for system size up to @xmath79 , showed that these variables , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , _ are not scale invariant _ , ( fig .  [ gammah ] ) .",
    "although for small avalanches the scaling behavior for the zhang model resembles the distribution of the same variables in the btw model , for large avalanches , we find a _ bend _ and a sudden change in slope .",
    "this bend is seen for all the system sizes that were checked . for large avalanches ,",
    "the geometric exponents are clearly different from the values recorded for the btw model and for the manna four - state models .",
    "this puts in question the previous assignment of the zhang model to the universality class of the btw model  @xcite .    to further characterize the avalanche structure we examined the function @xmath45 , that provides the number of toppling events at site @xmath7 during the avalanche ( fig .",
    "[ largeavalanche ] ) . for the btw model ,",
    "we observe a shell structure in which all sites which relaxed at least @xmath88 times form a connected cluster with no holes which is contained in the cluster of sites which relaxed at least @xmath44 times  @xcite .",
    "the manna four - state model exhibits a random avalanche structure with many peaks and holes  @xcite . in between we find the zhang model , which shows an avalanche structure which is mostly shelled , but is different from the btw picture by having several peaks and holes , but not as many as in the manna four - state model .    to obtain a more quantitative characterization of the terrace structure we chose typical large avalanches for each of the three models and plotted the terrace number @xmath44 as a function of its area ( fig .",
    "[ terraces ] ) .",
    "the results for the manna model are well fitted by an exponential , while a nearly linear decay is observed for the btw and zhang models .",
    "we have also measured , for the three models , the distribution exponents @xmath89 for terraces no .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 ( table  [ terracee ] ) .",
    "the results show quantitative differences in the avalanche structures , between the three models . in all cases",
    "@xmath89 decreases as @xmath44 is increased .",
    "the differences are significant with the lowest @xmath89 for zhang , intermediate for btw and highest for manna models . to obtain a more complete characterization of critical behavior in sandpile models",
    "we also examine the time evolution of the energy , avalanche size and area during the avalanche , averaged over a large number of avalanches . combining results for system sizes @xmath92 and",
    "@xmath93 we draw the scaling functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 that describe the averaged time evolution of the energy , number of active sites , and area growth during the avalanche .",
    "the scaling functions for the btw , manna and zhang models are shown in figs .",
    "[ btwscale ] ,  [ mannascale ] and  [ zhangscale ] , respectively .",
    "for the btw and manna models we find excellent data collapse indicating scaling behavior .",
    "no such scaling is found for the zhang model , indicating that it lacks some of the features of a critical system , which are found in the btw and manna models .",
    "for the btw model ( figs  [ btwscale ] ) we observe that all the three scaling functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are identical , so the system is basically described by a single scaling function . for the manna model , we find that @xmath96 and @xmath97 coincide , while @xmath95 is different .",
    "for the zhang model we find that there is no data collapse and there are no scaling scaling function .",
    "interestingly , for each system size the functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are identical , while @xmath95 is different .",
    "the average times are found to depend on the system size according to @xmath98 where @xmath71 .",
    "for the btw model @xmath99,@xmath100 and @xmath101 ; for the manna model @xmath102,@xmath103 and @xmath104 ; for the zhang model one can approximate these exponents by values @xmath105,@xmath106 and @xmath107 but there is a significant deviation from a straight line .",
    "we have studied universality in isotropic , abelian and non - abelian , sandpile models using a combination of extensive numerical simulations and an extended set of measures to characterize these models . in particular",
    ", we focused on the btw model ( which is abelian , deterministic and isotropic ) , manna model ( non - abelian , stochastic and isotropic on average ) and the zhang model ( non - abelian , deterministic and isotropic ) . for each model",
    "we have calculated the critical exponents which characterize an avalanche as a whole .",
    "these include the distribution exponents @xmath108 , that characterize the distribution of quantities such as avalanche size , area and lifetime , and the geometric exponents @xmath39 , that relate the scaling properties of different quantities .",
    "the geometric exponents @xmath39 are particularly useful for classification due to their weak dependence on the system size . comparing these exponents we find clear indications that the btw and manna models belong to different universality classes , in agreement with previous simulations  @xcite . as for the zhang model ,",
    "the geometric critical exponents are not well defined . for all system size examined the functions @xmath109 $ ] vs. @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , from which the exponents @xmath39 are obtained exhibit domains with different slopes for small and large avalanches .",
    "the small avalanche behavior is similar to the btw results , while the large avalanche behavior is different from both the btw and manna models .",
    "the avalanche structures of the three models are found to be significantly different .",
    "the btw avalanche structure is the most regular , the manna structure is the most irregular and the zhang avalanche structure is intermediate .",
    "we have also examined measures of the dynamics during the avalanche .",
    "we found scaling functions for the time evolutions of the energy @xmath96 , number of active sites @xmath97 , and the rate of area growth @xmath95 in the btw and manna models .",
    "for the btw model , all three scaling functions coincide , while for the manna model only the first two coincide .",
    "this is a qualitative different that further strengthen our conclusion that the two models belong to different universality classes . for the zhang model",
    "these functions do not exhibit scaling behavior .",
    "this is a further indication that the zhang model lacks some essential features of critical behavior , which appear in the btw and manna models , and thus belong to a different universality class .",
    "in fact , the only unambiguous scaling features of the zhang model are given by the distribution exponents @xmath108 .",
    "we thus conclude that the btw , manna and zhang models belong to three universality classes .",
    "our results disagree with the conclusions of a number of recent studies .",
    "lbeck studied the scaling behavior in the btw and zhang models using extensive numerical simulations  @xcite . relying only on the distribution exponents he concluded that the btw and zhang models belong to the same universality class . as we demonstrated above",
    ", the distribution exponents provide very limited characterization of the scaling behavior .",
    "therefore , these exponents alone do not provide enough information to support a conclusion that two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "moreover , the distribution exponents are strongly dependent on the system size .",
    "one should be careful in interpreting the results of the finite size analysis done in  @xcite , based on an assumed size dependence which is not substantiated theoretically .",
    "corral and diaz - guilera derived nonlinear partial differential equations based on the microscopic evolution rules of the btw and zhang models  @xcite . using a dynamic rg approach they studied and concluded that the two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "vespignani , zapperi and pietronero used a real space rg approach and concluded that the btw and manna models belong to the same universality class  @xcite .",
    "the failure of these approaches to distinguish between the universality classes indicates that some key ingredient of the dynamics is not taken into account .",
    "we speculate the these ingredient may be related to symmetries such as the abelian symmetry , as well as properties such as the deterministic vs. stochastic nature of the avalanche dynamics .",
