    "referees at that time found the paper too elementary .",
    "while this is probably true , i feel even after 7 years and more literature research , that the result might well have been overlooked . additionally , the multivariable crt can serve as an exercise in algebra or spice up an exposition about the traditional crt",
    ". the story also has a historical angle when looking for the origin of solving systems of linear equations with integer solutions .",
    "there was some controversy for example whether nicomachus has known anything about the crt even so there is much evidence against it @xcite .",
    "historically , it appears now certain that the method to solve the multivariable crt is due to the mathematician qin in the 13th century , an algorithm which in modern language would be considered a special case and precursor for the schreier - sims algorithm @xcite in computational group theory , an algorithm which is naturally used by everybody who solves puzzles whether it is the simple 15 puzzle or the more challenging rubik cube @xcite .",
