    "only @xmath610% of baryons reside within galaxies ( e.g. fukugita & peebles 2004 , shull et al .",
    "2012 ) , yet since galaxies lie at nodes in the cosmic web corresponding to local minima in the gravitational potential well , naively one would expect far more baryons to collate in galaxies , ultimately forming more stars .",
    "theoretical models offer a wide range of solutions to this problem , relying on the physics of gas , stars , and black hole accretion disks as so called ` baryonic feedback ' .",
    "however , observational studies are required to test these models and provide evidence for their range and applicability .    since the discovery that most galaxies contain a supermassive black hole ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) ,",

    "observationally , predominantly only very indirect means for linking the star formation in large populations of galaxies to their agn have been found , e.g. the strong dependence of the passive fraction on galaxy stellar mass ( e.g. baldry et al .",

    "more direct measurements of agn driven winds in galaxies and radio bubbles in galaxy haloes have provided evidence for the mechanisms of agn feedback , but typically only for a very small number of galaxies ( e.g. mcnamara et al . 2000 , nulsen et al . 2005 , mcnamara et al .",

    "both of these galaxy properties are expected to correlate strongly with the mass of the central black hole ( e.g. haring & rix 2004 , mcconnell & ma 2013 ) and hence may provide qualitative support for agn feedback driven quenching .",
    "we find in bluck et al .",
    "( 2014 ) that ` bulge mass is king ' in the sense that bulge mass is a tighter and steeper correlator to the passive fraction for centrals than any other variable considered ( including stellar mass , halo mass , disk mass , local density , and galaxy structure ) .",
    "we argue for an explanation of this observation through agn feedback , relying on the tight relationships between the bulge and central black hole ( e.g. haring & rix 2004 ) .",

    "testing of the group finding algorithm on model galaxies from the millennium simulation ( springel et al .",

    "centrals are defined as the most massive galaxy in the group , with satellites being any other galaxy within the group .",
    "we follow the prescription for defining the passive fraction in bluck et al .",
    "we define a galaxy to be passive if it is forming stars at a rate a factor of ten times lower than ( emission line , non - agn ) star forming galaxies matched at the same stellar mass and redshift .",
    "this cleanly divides the two peaks of the bimodal distribution in sfr at all mass ranges .",
    "the passive fraction is the ratio of passive - to - total galaxies in each binning .",
    "we correct for the flux limit of the sdss by weighting each galaxy in the passive fraction by the inverse of the volume over which its @xmath12 magnitudes would pass all of the selection criteria .",

    "today there are less than 100 reliable dynamical measurements of central black hole masses in existence ( see mcconnell & ma 2013 for a compilation ) .",
    "this is far too few to investigate the dependence of the passive fraction on black hole mass directly , due in part to the statistical nature of the passive fraction and the need for a wide range in galaxy properties .",
    "fortunately , there exist tight relationships between dynamical measurements of central black hole masses and the properties of their host galaxies , particularly the bulge or spheroid in which the black hole resides ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; haring & rix 2004 ) . on a case by case basis , using these relationships to estimate a given galaxy s black hole mass would lead to a high level of uncertainty , but for very large samples the average values should yield reliable measurements , in the regime where the relationships are tested .    in this work",
    ", we use a number of the galaxy - black hole relationships from the literature to estimate black hole masses .",
    "specifically , we use central velocity dispersion ( @xmath17 ) , stellar mass of the bulge or spheroid ( @xmath18 ) , and combinations of these two .",
    "we also test separating the sample into early- and late - type systems and using separate scaling laws for each ( as suggested in mcconnell et al .",
    "the formulae used to estimate the black hole masses , and the references for these , are all presented in table 1 .    for the velocity dispersions ,",
    "we first make an aperture correction , so that all measurements are made at the same effective aperture .",
    "we use the formula in jorgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , specifically calculating :    @xmath19    where the central radius , @xmath20 , is chosen to be in line with the measurements made in the literature , with typical values of @xmath21 or @xmath22 used .",
    "@xmath21 is the bulge ( or spheroid ) effective radius , calculated in our sample through srsic index fitting ( see simard et al .",
    "2011 for full details ) .",
    "we note that the aperture correction only affects the final mass estimate by typically @xmath010% . for the bulge masses",
    "no such correction is necessary , and thus , this provides a natural test to the reliability of the method .",
    "since our goal is to present the passive fraction dependence on black hole mass for all galaxies , we do not restrict the sample to pure spheroids .",
    "thus , there is a substantial population of disks present in our sample .",
    "this poses no significant difficulty for measuring the black hole masses via bulge mass ( but see bluck et al .",
    "2014 appendices for a discussion on their reliability ) .",
    "however , for the velocity dispersions , contamination in their measurement from rotating disks could be an issue .",
    "we test this in the next section by looking at early- and late - type galaxies separately , and comparing estimates of @xmath5 from velocity dispersion methods to bulge mass methods .",
    "we additionally test the impact of the choice of black hole mass calibration by comparing a number of different techniques , noting a high level of consistency between them ( see next section ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath23 for the etg/ ltg samples , galaxies defined as early types ( @xmath24 0.5 ) are fit with the etg formula and those defined as late types ( @xmath25 0.5 ) are fit with the ltg formula , they are then recombined into the same sample , and shown in red in fig",
    "@xmath26 is the number of galaxies used in the dynamical fit .",
    "in this section we compute , for the first time , the relationship between the fraction of passive galaxies and the mass of their central supermassive black holes , for a population of over 400,000 central galaxies ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the left panel shows the @xmath27 relationship for all central galaxies , which are defined as the most massive group members in the catalogues of yang et al .",
    "we show this relationship via a number of different black hole mass calibrations , summarized in table 1 .",
    "these include relationships from various authors based on central velocity dispersion , bulge mass , and a combination of the two . for the full morphological sample",
    ", there is remarkably good agreement between all of the methods used for estimating black hole masses .",
    "the @xmath27 relationship is very steep for central galaxies , with galaxies with low black hole masses being predominantly star forming and galaxies with high black hole masses being predominantly passive .",
    "the cross - over mass , where 50% of galaxies are passive occurs at @xmath28 .",
    "values of black hole mass @xmath29 are highly uncertain due to the @xmath30 , @xmath18 relations not extending into this domain",
    ". additionally , velocity dispersions @xmath0 70 km / s are less reliable than for the rest of the sample ( e.g. bernardi et al . 2007 ) , and this corresponds to approximately @xmath5 @xmath29 as well . for these reasons ,",
    "we advise readers to treat the low @xmath5 values more as upper limits ( this threshold is indicated with a dashed vertical line in all relevant plots ) .    in the middle and right panels of fig",
    ". 1 , we show the passive fraction - black hole mass relationship for centrals split into early - types ( @xmath24 0.5 ) and late - types ( @xmath25 0.5 ) respectively ( computed in mendel et al .",
    "for the early - type sample , all of the black hole mass estimates lead to very similar passive fraction relationships , as with the full sample .",
    "however , for the late - type galaxies , there is some disagreement between methods which use velocity dispersion alone and those which incorporate bulge mass .",
    "specifically , the passive fraction is lower for velocity dispersion estimates of black hole mass than with bulge mass estimates .",
    "this is most probably explained by the velocity dispersions being contaminated by disk rotation into the plane of the sky , and by measurements of the absorption line widths being contaminated by multiple emission lines obscuring the true continua . both of these effects can lead to an over - estimate of the black hole mass , and hence lead to lower passive fractions for the measured black hole masses from velocity dispersion methods compared to bulge mass methods .    for bulge mass only methods contamination of the kinematic measurement in disks",
    "is clearly not an issue , but interestingly , in the case where we use @xmath17 and @xmath18 together ( hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ) , the contamination is also negligible ( compare blue and cyan lines in fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .",
    "thus , we posit that to estimate black hole masses for the full morphological sample ( i.e. including disk galaxies ) a measure of the mass of the bulge is _ essential _ to include . for the remainder of the analyses in this letter we focus on the black hole mass estimates from bulge mass and velocity dispersion together ( from hopkins et al",
    ". 2007 , see top row of table 1 ) , where kinematic contamination is not a significant issue .",
    "this technique draws on multiple complementary measurements of the central regions of galaxies , from spectroscopic kinematics and photometric profile and sed fitting .",
    "we note that all of our conclusions remain unchanged if we restrict to early - type galaxies only and use velocity dispersion methods to compute our black hole masses .",
    "the advantage of incorporating the bulge mass is to leave the sample complete .    in an upcoming paper in the series ( paper ii , bluck et al . in prep . )",
    "we show the passive fraction relationship with black hole mass for satellites .",
    "we find that , whereas centrals with low black hole masses are essentially all star forming , satellites with low black hole masses are more frequently passive .",
    "this hints at the need for additional quenching mechanisms to agn feedback for satellites , but not necessarily for centrals .      the steep dependence of the passive fraction on supermassive black hole mass for centrals ( fig . 1",
    ", left panel ) is consistent with the quenching of central galaxies being driven by agn feedback .",
    "however , given that there are observationally well known , and theoretically expected , correlations between the black hole mass ( derived from @xmath18 and/or @xmath17 ) and other galaxy properties ( e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) , it is not immediately clear whether the @xmath27 relationship is fundamental or not ( i.e. whether it is derivative of some other , more fundamental , parameter ) .    to test the possibility that another galaxy property is more fundamental to passivity than black hole mass , we look at the @xmath27 relationship at a fixed values of the following galaxies properties : @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 ( presented in fig .",
    "2 , top row ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath27 relationship remains tight and steep even at a fixed halo mass , stellar mass and galaxy structure ( @xmath4 ) . out of these three variables",
    ", we find the greatest variation at a fixed @xmath5 with @xmath4 , suggesting that the structure of a galaxy is an important secondary consideration for whether a galaxy will be forming stars or not . in fig .",
    "2 ( bottom row ) we present the @xmath31 , and @xmath4 relationships , each at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "these are all remarkably flat compared to the @xmath27 relationship , suggesting that it must be more fundamental than these alternatives .",
    "particularly , the @xmath32 relationship , at a fixed @xmath5 , is almost entirely flat , indicating essentially no dependence of galaxy quenching on the mass of the halo , once the correlation with black hole mass is accounted for .",
    "this has a profound implication for models of galaxy quenching .",
    "methods that derive the energy to do work on the gas in a galaxy from the dark matter halo can not be driving the quenching of centrals ( e.g. halo mass quenching , dekel & birnboim 2006 , dekel et al .",
    "2009 , woo et al .",
    "however , at high @xmath5 values , there is some hint of a subtle positive correlation of the passive fraction with @xmath3 , which may be explained if agn feedback is more efficient in higher mass haloes ( e.g. dekel et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the @xmath33 relationship at fixed @xmath5 is either flat , or in certain @xmath5 ranges , _",
    "negative_. this striking result clearly indicates that stellar mass is not the primary driver to passivity in central galaxies ( as advocated in baldry et al .",
    "2006 , peng et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "this result further suggests that the quenching of central galaxies can not be driven by stellar or supernova feedback , which would both correlate with @xmath2 ( as integrated star formation rate ) more strongly than with @xmath5 .",
    "the negative trend is most probably explained by the fact that increasing @xmath2 at fixed @xmath5 results in an increase in @xmath34 , and hence a decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "this follows directly from the @xmath35 relationship , and we have seen already that @xmath4 is an important _ secondary _ correlator to the passive fraction .",
    "the @xmath27 relationship is also steeper and tighter than the @xmath36 relationship ( which was suggested to be primary in driver et al .",
    "2006 , cameron et al .",
    "this implies that major galaxy mergers ( which can destroy in situ disks , e.g. , cole et al .",
    "2000 ) are not necessary for quenching central galaxies , but substantial central black holes are . however , see hopkins et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for evidence that disks can regrow in the merger process complicating this issue .",
    "additionally , morphological quenching ( e.g. martig et al . 2009 ) can not be the primary driver to the quenching of star formation in centrals , since black hole mass correlates much stronger with the passive fraction than galaxy structure .",
    "see bluck et al .",
    "( 2014 )  5 for a more thorough discussion on the role of various processes in quenching central galaxies .",
    "we consider the relative role of the supermassive black hole in quenching central and satellites galaxies compared to many other galaxy properties ( including bulge mass , disk mass , and local density ) in an upcoming work in this series ( paper iii , teimoorinia et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "black hole mass remains the most important single correlator to the passive fraction in this larger analysis as well .",
    "in this letter , we present for the first time the relationship between the fraction of passive galaxies and the mass of their supermassive black holes , for a sample of over 400,000 central galaxies at z @xmath0 0.2 ( fig .",
    "we find that the @xmath27 relationship is very steep , with the vast majority of galaxies with low black hole masses being star forming and the vast majority of galaxies with high black hole masses being passive .",
    "we find a cross - over mass ( where 50% of galaxies are passive ) at @xmath28 .",
    "the steep dependence of the passive fraction on black hole mass is consistent with agn feedback being the dominant mechanism for quenching central galaxies .",
    "we test splitting our sample into early- and late - types , finding generally very good accord between all of the black hole mass estimates , except for late - type galaxies . here",
    "we find that incorporating bulge mass into the black hole mass estimate is essential because velocity dispersion alone methods are vulnerable to contamination from disk rotation .",
    "finally , we find that black hole mass is a more fundamental correlator to the passive fraction than total stellar mass , group halo mass , or galaxy structure ( fig .",
    "this is highly suggestive of the quenching of central galaxies being driven by agn feedback .",
    "however , it is not inconceivable that the mechanism which grows the central region of galaxies ( and presumably their supermassive black holes as well ) is directly responsible for the quenching of central galaxies . yet",
    "this would have to occur in such a way as to leave the central density as the primary correlator to the passive fraction , with @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 being substantially less important .",
    "we conclude that this is less likely than agn feedback being responsible .         + baldry i. k. , balogh m. l. , bower r. g. , glazebrook k. , nichol r. c. , bamford s. p. , budavari t. , 2006 , mnras , 373 , 469 + bernardi m. et al . , 2003 , aj , 125 , 1817 + bernardi m. , hyde j. b. , sheth r. k. , miller c. j. , nichol r. c. , 2007 , aj , 133 , 1741 + bluck a. f. l. , conselice c. j. , almaini o. , laird e. , nandra k. & gruetzbauch r. , 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1174 + bluck a. f. l. , mendel j. t. , ellison s. l. , moreno j. , simard l. , patton d. r. , starkenburg e. , 2014 , mnras , 441 , 599 + bower r. g. et al . , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 645 + bower r. g. , mccarthy i. g. , benson , a. j. , 2008 , mnras , 390 , 1399 + brinchmann j. , charlot s. , white s. d. m. , tremonti c. , kauffmann g. , heckman t. , brinkmann j. , 2004 , mnras , 351 , 1151     + cameron e. , driver s. p. , graham a. w. , liske j. , 2009 , apj , 699 , 105 + cameron e. , driver s. p. , 2009 ,",
