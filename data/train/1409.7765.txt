    "3 .   when @xmath0 is large ( e.g. @xmath81 ) the maximum in  ( [ eq : thmain ] ) is not always attained by either @xmath59 or @xmath82 .",
    "it is not clear whether such anomalies only happen in the region of rates where our bound is inferior to blinovsky s .",
    "the result of corollary  [ th : slope ] follows by weakening  ( [ eq : thmain ] ) ( via concavity of @xmath83 , lemma  [ th : f1 ] ) to @xmath84 the @xmath85 condition is only used to show that the maximum is attained at @xmath59 .",
    "note also that weakening  ( [ eq : slo1 ] ) corresponds to omitting the extra elias - bassalygo type reduction , which is responsible for the extra optimization over @xmath86 in  ( [ eq : thmain ] ) .",
    "finally , at the invitation of anonymous reviewer we give our intuition about why our bound outperforms blinovsky s for odd @xmath0 .",
    "it is easiest to compare with the weakening  ( [ eq : slo1 ] ) of our bound .",
    "now compare the two proofs :    1 .",
    "blinovsky  @xcite first uses elias - bassalygo reduction to restrict attention to a subcode @xmath87 situated on a hamming sphere of radius @xmath88 .",
    "then he proves an upper bound for @xmath89 valid as long as @xmath90 via a plotkin - type argument together with a great symmetrization idea . 2 .",
    "our bound ( following ashikhmin , barg and litsyn  @xcite ) instead uses a kalai - linial  @xcite reduction to select a subcode @xmath91 situated on a hamming sphere of radius @xmath92 .",
    "we then proceeded to prove a ( plotkin - type ) upper bound on a strange quantity : @xmath93 which corresponds to a requirement that the code contain not more than @xmath94 codewords in any ball of radius @xmath95 , but only for those balls that happen to also contain the origin .",
    "notice that the sphere returned by kalai - linial is bigger than that of elias - bassalygo ( which is the reason our bound deteriorates at large rates ) , but the good thing is that the subcode @xmath91 has another codeword @xmath96 at the center of the hamming sphere .",
    "now , intuitively @xmath95 is roughly equivalent to @xmath97 . the zero - rate ( plotkin )",
    "radius for a list-@xmath0 decoding of binary codes on hamming sphere @xmath98 is given by @xmath99\\over l+1 } \\",
    ", , w_\\xi \\sim \\mathrm{bino}(l+1,\\xi)\\,.\\ ] ] so intuitively , we expect that blinovsky s bound should give @xmath100 while our bound should give @xmath101 finally , it is easy to check that for even @xmath0 we have @xmath102 , while for odd @xmath0 , @xmath103 .",
    "this is the main intuitive reason why our bound succeeds in improving blinovsky s , but only for odd @xmath0 .",
    "consider an arbitrary sequence of codes @xmath104 of rate @xmath42 . as in  @xcite",
    "we start by using delsarte s linear programming to select a large component of the distance distribution of the code .",
    "namely , we apply result of kalai and linial  ( * ? ? ?",

    "next , use concavity of @xmath83 s ( lemma  [ th : f1 ] ) to relax  ( [ eq : thmain ] ) to @xmath368 from  ( [ eq : nx1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : nx2 ] ) it is clear that @xmath369 is monotonically increasing for all @xmath217 on the interval @xmath370 $ ] .",
    "thus , we further have @xmath371 bound  ( [ eq : sl1 ] ) is valid for all @xmath372 $ ] and arbitrary ( odd / even @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath42 is small ( say , @xmath373 ) and @xmath0 is odd , @xmath75 belongs to the neighborhood of @xmath374 in lemma  [ th : n ] and thus  ( [ eq : sl0 ] ) follows from  ( [ eq : sl1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : n1a ] ) .    [ rm : evenl ] it is , perhaps , instructive to explain why corollary  [ th : slope ] can not be shown for even @xmath0 ( via theorem  [ th : main ] ) . for even @xmath0 the maximum over @xmath12 of @xmath375 is attained at @xmath341 and @xmath376 therefore , for @xmath377 we get from  ( [ eq : sm3 ] ) that the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : sl1 ] ) evaluates to @xmath378 thus , comparing  ( [ eq : sm4 ] ) with  ( [ eq : sm1 ] ) we conclude that for even @xmath0 our bound on @xmath379 has negative slope at zero rate .",
    "note that blinovsky s bound  ( [ eq : blin ] ) has negative slope at zero rate for both odd and even @xmath0 .      instead of working with parameter @xmath380",
    "we introduce @xmath381 $ ] such that @xmath382 we then apply theorem  [ th : main ] with @xmath56 .",
    "notice that the bound on @xmath47 in  ( [ eq : xi0ineq ] ) becomes @xmath383 by a simple substitution @xmath384 we get from  ( [ eq : ed_2 ] ) @xmath385 therefore , when @xmath386 we notice that @xmath387 implying that defining equation for @xmath86 , i.e.  ( [ eq : xidef ] ) , coincides with  ( [ eq : bd3c ] ) .",
    "note that the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : bd3b ] ) is precisely equal to @xmath389 so this corollary simply states that for @xmath57 the maximum in  ( [ eq : thmain ] ) is achieved at @xmath390 .",
    "let us restate this last statement rigorously : the maximum @xmath391 is achieved at @xmath392 .",
    "here @xmath393 is a solution of @xmath394 for notational convenience we will denote the function under maximization in  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) by @xmath395 .      *",
    "first , we estimate the maximum over @xmath47 for @xmath341 as follows : @xmath396 where @xmath397 are given by @xmath398 * second , we prove that for @xmath59 function @xmath399 is monotonically increasing .",
    "once these two steps are shown , it is easy to verify ( for example , numerically ) that @xmath400 exceeds both @xmath401 ( term corresponding to @xmath402 in  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) ) and the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) ( term corresponding to @xmath341 ) .",
    "notice that this relation holds for all rates .",
    "therefore , maximum in  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) is indeed attained at @xmath392 .",
    "one trick that will be common to both steps is the following . from the proof of lemma  [",
    "th : john ] it is clear that the estimate  ( [ eq : john ] ) is monotonic in @xmath403 .",
    "therefore , in equation  ( [ eq : m3 ] ) we may replace @xmath38 with any upper - bound of it .",
    "we will use the well - known upper - bound , which leads to binomial estimates of spectrum components  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 46 ) ) : @xmath404 furthermore , it can also be argued that maximum can not be attained by @xmath47 so small that @xmath405 so from now on , we assume that @xmath406 and that @xmath407 is determined from the equation : @xmath408 ( we remind @xmath409 ) .",
    "we proceed to demonstrating  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce @xmath410 by constraints on @xmath9 it is easy to see that @xmath411 therefore , we have @xmath412 and thus @xmath413 defined in  ( [ eq : m2a ] ) .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath414 and since @xmath415 we get that @xmath416 defined in  ( [ eq : m2b ] ) .    next ,",
    "notice that @xmath417 is decreasing on @xmath418 $ ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath419 where in the last step we introduced @xmath420 for convenience .",
    "consequently , we get @xmath421 rearranging terms yield  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) .",
    "notice that regardless of the function @xmath425 we have the equivalence : @xmath426 where we recall definition of @xmath427 in  ( [ eq : m4a])-  ( [ eq : m4b ] ) . differentiating  ( [ eq : m3a ] ) in @xmath47 ( and recalling that @xmath42 is fixed , while @xmath428 is an implicit function of @xmath47 ) we find @xmath429 next , one can notice that the map @xmath430 is a bijection onto the region @xmath431 with the inverse map given by @xmath432    thus , verifying  ( [ eq : m4 ] ) can as well be done for all @xmath427 inside the region  ( [ eq : m5 ] ) . substituting @xmath433 into  ( [ eq : m4 ] )",
    "we get that monotonicity in  ( [ eq : m3 ] ) is equivalent to a two - dimensional inequality : @xmath434 it is possible to verify numerically that indeed  ( [ eq : m6 ] ) holds on the set  ( [ eq : m5 ] ) . for example , one may first demonstrate that it is sufficient to restrict to @xmath435 and then verify a corresponding inequality in @xmath436 only .",
