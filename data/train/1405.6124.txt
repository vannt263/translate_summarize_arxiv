    "in the analysis and modelling of spectral lines observed in magnetic upper main sequence stars , it is normally assumed that the splitting of the lines is correctly described by the anomalous zeeman effect .",
    "however , in some cases the fine structure splitting of one or both levels involved in a transition is very small , and magnetic fields found in some stars are large enough to produce magnetic splitting comparable in size to this small fine structure splitting . in these cases ,",
    "the splitting of the line should be calculated taking into account both the fine structure splitting and the magnetic splitting simultaneously .",
    "this regime is known as the incomplete or partial paschen - back ( ppb ) effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "the partial paschen - back regime can occur when observed spectral line profiles are created by closely spaced doublets or triplets .",
    "calculation of the paschen - back splitting of spectral lines has been incorporated into the zeeman2 code ( @xcite ) , which allows us to simulate a line profile composed of several spectral lines ( blends ) , some of which are split in the paschen - back regime , while the others are split in the zeeman regime .",
    "initially , this code was created by @xcite for the simulation of polarimetric ( stokes @xmath5 ) line profiles , and was later modified by @xcite , who added an automatic minimization of the model parameters using the downhill simplex method .",
    "the procedure for calculation of paschen - back splitting takes into account the magnetically perturbed energy levels and determines the respective air wavelength and oscillator strength of components , based on the term configurations and the total strength of all lines in the multiplet under consideration .",
    "the simulation of stokes @xmath0 profiles of siii and siiii lines is carried for a star with @xmath6=13000k , @xmath7=4.0 , zero microturbulent velocity , and an oblique rotator model with a dipolar magnetic field structure , assuming that the field strength at the magnetic pole is @xmath8 and the the axis of magnetic dipole forms an angle @xmath9= 0@xmath10 , 45@xmath10 and 90@xmath10 with the line of sight .",
    "the observed stokes @xmath0 spectra are usually contaminated by observational noise @xmath11 . to decide whether the difference between the simulated ppb and zeeman profiles can be confidently detected above the given noise level we use the _ chi square probability function _ ( @xcite ) @xmath12^{-1 } \\int_{\\chi^2/2}^{\\infty}{t^{\\frac{\\nu}{2}-1 } e^{-t}\\ ; dt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the number of resolved elements in the analyzed profile and @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the intensity of the stokes @xmath0 profiles at a wavelength point @xmath17 calculated with the assumption of the ppb and zeeman splitting , respectively . for @xmath18 and @xmath19 the probability that ppb and zeeman profiles are indistinguishable is @xmath20 .",
    "this confidence level seems to be quite robust to perform an evaluation of the difference between the ppb and zeeman profiles for individual lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the siii 5957 , 5979 , 6347 , 6371 and siiii 4552 , 4567 , 4574 lines provide @xmath21 close to zero with almost no dependence on the magnetic field strength for the stokes @xmath0 profiles . for the siii 3856 , 3862 and 4130 lines",
    "there is no dependence of @xmath21 on magnetic field strength for @xmath2220 kg . meanwhile , for the siii 4128 , 4200 , 4621 , 5041 , 5466 and 7849 lines , the simulated ppb and zeeman profiles appear to be different ( @xmath20 assuming s / n=250 and @xmath23 = 1 km s@xmath3 ) for a magnetic field strength @xmath24=5 - 15 kg .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of the probability ( see eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) on the magnetic field strength for higher rotational velocities ( 1 km s@xmath25 30 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the analysis of the siii 4128 , 5041 , 5466 and 7849 lines with s / n = 250 shows that the application of the ppb splitting for the simulation of stokes @xmath0 profiles remains important in stars with @xmath26 15 km s@xmath3 when the field strength is @xmath1  10 - 15 kg .",
    ".approximation of siii 5041 line observed in the spectrum of hd  318107 ( phase 0.991 ) employing the ppb and zeeman effects ( see text for details ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the bottom of the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can see that the ppb effect becomes important for simulations of the stokes @xmath0 profile of siii 5041 line when @xmath275 kg . for this line",
    "the difference between the simulated ppb and zeeman profiles appears due to the so called  ghost \" line with @xmath28 ( @xcite ) . to test the obtained theoretical results ,",
    "the stokes i and v profiles of this particular line were analysed for the magnetic ap star hd318107 ( @xmath6= 11800 k , @xmath7= 4.2 ) using both zeeman and ppb splitting .",
    "the geometry of the magnetic field model used for this star is described by the following parameters : @xmath29= 25.6 kg , @xmath30= -12.8 kg , @xmath31= 0.9 kg that we have adopted from @xcite . the weak blending lines fei 5040.85 , 5040.90 and feii 5040.76 are also taken into account during the simulation , assuming their zeeman magnetic splitting . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one can see that the best fit of the observed data is obtained assuming ppb splitting of siii 5041 line and the contribution of the iron blends ( see second line in the tabl .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the obtained data are close to the results derived by @xcite from a complex analysis of different spectral lines for this star .",
    "the remaining differences between the ppb profiles and the observed spectra may be partially explained in terms of a more complicated actual magnetic field structure and/or horizontal and vertical stratification of the silicon abundance .",
    "if the available polarimetric spectra of the stars with strong magnetic field have s / n ratio higher than 250 , the use of ppb splitting during the analysis of spectral lines is necessary to obtain precise results in the framework of an assumed model for the abundance map and the magnetic field structure . in particular , stokes @xmath0 profiles of some siii lines , when calculated with the ppb splitting , differ significantly from those calculated with the zeeman effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this difference appears due to the different relative intensities and positions of split @xmath32 and @xmath33-components in the ppb and zeeman regimes , and due to the  ghost \" lines ( @xmath34 ) as in the case of siii 5041 line ( @xcite ) . for this",
    "line profile a contribution from the  ghost \" lines becomes significant for @xmath1  5 kg and an enhanced ( by 1 dex ) silicon abundance ."
