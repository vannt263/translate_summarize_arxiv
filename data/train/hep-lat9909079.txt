    "given the close connection between @xmath15 and the subleading terms in @xmath7 which drive the deconfinement transition , it is natural to examine  the behavior of @xmath16 near @xmath17 as measured in simulations .",

    "this suggests that a term in @xmath7 proportional to @xmath20 plays an important role in the deconfinement transition .",
    "it is also necessary to have a term proportional to @xmath21 ( independent of @xmath4 ) , so that there is a non - zero free energy density difference between confined and deconfined phases at very low temperatures .",
    "thus we conjecture the simple form for the free energy @xmath22 where @xmath23 must favor the confined phase to yield confinement at arbitrarily low temperatures .",
