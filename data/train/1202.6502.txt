    "@xmath145 is the normalized position autocorrelation function .",
    "therefore , the time - averaged variable @xmath4 in fact is an indicator of the correlation of the spatial displacement , not the ta msd of a trajectory . for ergodic systems satisfying the khinchin theorem ( @xmath146 ) , the ta msd always saturates to @xmath147 , where the relaxation dynamics reflecting the spatial correlation can be very slow although the system is already fully relaxed , as shown in this study .",
    "accordingly , in performing single trajectory analysis , one should be aware of the potential pitfalls in using @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to non - ergodic systems @xcite , the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath16 and the anomalous diffusion constant @xmath14 can be estimated from the log - log plot of the ta msd at short lag times .",
    "meanwhile , physical quantities associated with confinement such as the effective confinement size and the relaxation time could be incorrectly deduced from the long-@xmath2 behavior of @xmath4 .",

    "the ensemble mean of @xmath149 is @xmath153 , and thus this definition does not even work for the brownian case .",
