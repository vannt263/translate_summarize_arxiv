    "an intriguing body of evidence hinting at a deep connection between hoava - lifshitz gravity and causal dynamical triangulations has recently accumulated in the literature . first , one of us demonstrated consistency of the spectral dimension computed in hoava - lifshitz gravity with the spectral dimension measured in causal dynamical triangulations in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite . benedetti _",
    "et al _ then verified within causal dynamical triangulations @xcite the prediction of hoava - lifshitz gravity for the behavior of the spectral dimension in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite .",
    "next , ambjrn _ et al _ exhibited the remarkable resemblance of the phase diagram of causal dynamical triangulations @xcite to the phase diagram of lifshitz matter systems @xcite as exemplified by the lifshitz scalar field @xcite .",
    "these authors and one of us also conjectured @xcite that the apparent tricritical point of the former phase diagram could correspond to the tricritical limit of hoava - lifshitz gravity with dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 equal to the dimension of space . then , both benedetti _ et al _ and ambjrn _ et al _ noted the compatibility of certain solutions of hoava - lifshitz gravity with the minisuperspace model fit to the expectation value of the geometries emerging from causal dynamical triangulations @xcite .",
    "recently , sotiriou _ et al _ successfully fit the behavior of the spectral dimension of causal dynamical triangulations at intermediate scales to a dispersion relation derived from hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "just days ago , budd argued that the kinetic term in the semiclassical effective action of causal dynamical triangulations exhibits a hoava - lifshitz - like form @xcite .",
    "this mounting evidence motivated us to extend the regge action  or , more precisely , the discrete path integral measure  used in causal dynamical triangulations to include dependence on the broader class of terms appearing in the action of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "our purpose is threefold : firstly , to test the applicability of causal dynamical triangulations to modified classical theories of gravitation ; secondly , to explore quantum hoava - lifshitz gravity with nonperturbative techniques ; and , thirdly , to illuminate further the links between hoava - lifshitz gravity and causal dynamical triangulations . as an initial step toward these goals ,",
    "we have begun to investigate an appropriate reduction of @xmath0-dimensional projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity using causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "this model , though removed from the phenomenologically interesting case of @xmath2 dimensions , serves as a simplified yet nontrivial beginning for our research .",
    "after briefly introducing the formalisms of hoava - lifshitz gravity and causal dynamical triangulations in section [ background ] , we explain our adaptation of causal dynamical triangulations to hoava - lifshitz gravity in section [ discreteaction ] .",
    "we present the results of our initial numerical studies ",
    "evidence for the existence of extended phases of geometry , the structure of these phases , and their relation to the classical solutions  in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions and discuss ongoing and future work in section [ outlook ] . to streamline our presentation , we relegate to appendix [ app1 ] the construction of the relevant classical solutions of hoava - lifshitz gravity and to appendix [ app2 ] certain geometric properties of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "hoava - lifshitz gravity is a field theory of the dynamical metric on spacetime manifolds that carry the additional structure of a preferred foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the relevant set of gauge symmetries is then the group @xmath5 of diffeomorphisms of the spacetime manifold @xmath6 that preserve the preferred foliation @xmath7 .",
    "the foliation structure leads to one important novelty : the possibility of anisotropic scaling with a nontrivial dynamical scaling exponent @xmath4 measuring the degree of anisotropy between space and time . in minkowski spacetime",
    "the relativistic scaling is thus replaced by the anisotropic scaling    @xmath8    for constant @xmath9 . starting with @xmath10 at short distances",
    "markedly improves the ultraviolet behavior of the theory , potentially rendering it power - counting renormalizable .",
    "one might be tempted to rewrite this theory in a manifestly relativistic fashion by integrating in the remaining part of the group @xmath11 of full spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "this procedure leads to a reformulation of the model as a specific scalar - tensor theory with higher - derivative interactions in which the spacelike hypersurfaces of constant scalar field dynamically determine the leaves of the foliation @xmath7 . such a relativistic rewriting is only equivalent to the original nonrelativistic formulation at the classical level with , moreover , subtle regularity conditions on the scalar field s dynamics . at the quantum level the relativistic rewriting",
    "immediately besets the theory with the notorious problem of time , whereas the nonrelativistic nature of the original formulation of hoava - lifshitz gravity potentially renders the spacetime metric s dynamics more directly compatible with quantum mechanics .",
    "additionally , as we shall show , the original formulation of hoava - lifshitz gravity is nicely suited to the framework of causal dynamical triangulations , which also utilizes a preferred foliation structure in the microscopic definition of the path integral for gravity .    in a local smooth coordinate chart @xmath12 adapted to the preferred foliation @xmath7",
    ", @xmath5 consists of all reparametrizations of the form    [ reparametrizations ] @xmath13    for arbitrary functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that , although reparametrizations of the space coordinates may be time - dependent , reparametrizations of the time coordinate must be space - independent . given its preferred foliation , the structure of hoava - lifshitz gravity is naturally discussed in the arnowitt - deser - misner formalism @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the spacetime metric tensor @xmath16 is decomposed into the metric tensor @xmath17 on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 of constant time coordinate @xmath19 , the shift vector @xmath20 , and the lapse function @xmath21 such that one can reassemble the standard line element as @xmath22\\left[\\mathrm{d}x^{j}+n^{j}(t,\\mathbf{x})\\mathrm{d}t\\right].\\ ] ] note , however , that recombining the spatial metric tensor , the shift vector , and the lapse function into the spacetime line element ( [ relatds ] ) is somewhat misleading since , in the regime with @xmath10 , different terms contributing to @xmath23 carry different scaling dimensions .",
    "the shift vector and the lapse function play the role of gauge fields associated with @xmath5 .",
    "since the time coordinate reparametrizations are independent of the space coordinates , a natural choice is to restrict the corresponding gauge field @xmath21 also to be only a function of the time coordinate .",
    "we choose to make this restriction , yielding the so - called projectable version of the theory .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite . )",
    "of course , we have interest in studying the more general nonprojectable version in which the lapse function is a spacetime field and of which the projectable version is a dynamical limit .",
    "the gauge symmetries then permit new terms in the action involving spatial derivatives of the lapse function ; finding the appropriate realization of such terms in the framework of causal dynamical triangulations is beyond the present work s scope .",
    "we instead focus on the projectable version of hoava - lifshitz gravity , which has a particularly clear translation into the language of causal dynamical triangulations .    employing the arnowitt - deser - misner decomposition of the metric tensor",
    ", we now construct the action of projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "we aim to build a power - counting renormalizable unitary classical theory of gravitation . even in relativistic gravity , including higher curvature terms can render the theory renormalizable @xcite ; typically , however , such terms come at the cost of sacrificing perturbative unitarity and propagating unphysical degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "these issues stem from the inclusion of higher temporal derivative terms , which necessarily accompany higher spatial derivative terms in a relativistic theory . by only permitting higher spatial derivatives",
    ", we can in principle avoid problems with perturbative unitarity and unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "working in the arnowitt - deser - misner formalism allows for the rather straightforward inclusion of higher spatial derivatives and exclusion of higher temporal derivatives as we desire in constructing the action of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "we build the general action in @xmath24 spatial dimensions as the sum of a kinetic term quadratic in temporal derivatives and a potential term of mass dimension @xmath25 in spatial derivatives .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4 thus equals @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , we form the kinetic term from invariants of @xmath26 .",
    "this derivative alone is not covariant under @xmath5 , but the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath27 of a spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 satisfies this criterion . with @xmath27 having components @xmath28\\ ] ] for the covariant derivative @xmath29 associated with @xmath17 ,",
    "the most general kinetic term invariant under @xmath5 is @xmath30.\\ ] ] here the parameter @xmath31 arises from the generalized dewitt supermetric compatible with the theory s gauge symmetries , and @xmath32 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we form the potential term from invariants of @xmath17 and its spatial derivatives .",
    "the most general potential term is @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] is a scalar functional of the spatial metric tensor and its spatial derivatives up to order @xmath25 .",
    "putting together and , the action of projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity is @xmath35=\\frac{1}{16\\pi g } \\int_{\\mathcal{m}}\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\mathrm{d}^{d}x\\sqrt{\\gamma(t,\\mathbf{x})}n(t)\\left\\{k_{ij}(t,\\mathbf{x})k^{ij}(t,\\mathbf{x})-\\lambda k^{2}(t,\\mathbf{x } ) - v\\left[\\mathbf{\\gamma}(t,\\mathbf{x})\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] note that the coupling constant @xmath36 is related but not equal to the newton constant @xmath37 : the low energy newton constant @xmath37 is determined by rescaling the time coordinate by an effective speed of light factor selected so that the term linear in the spatial ricci scalar within @xmath34 $ ] is correctly normalized with respect to the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this rescaling also dictates how the constant term in @xmath34 $ ] relates to the low energy cosmological constant @xmath38 .    for @xmath39 , with the anticipated @xmath40 scaling at short distances",
    ", there is a proliferation of marginal and relevant contributions to the potential term ; for @xmath41 , however , the most general action containing only the marginal and relevant terms for @xmath42 is quite compact : @xmath43&=&\\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\int_{\\mathcal{m}}\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x\\sqrt{\\gamma(t,\\mathbf{x})}n(t)\\left[k_{ij}(t,\\mathbf{x})k^{ij}(t,\\mathbf{x})-\\lambda k^{2}(t,\\mathbf{x})\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-\\alpha r_{2}^{2}(t,\\mathbf{x})+\\beta r_{2}(t,\\mathbf{x})-2\\lambda \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 the ricci scalar of the spatial metric tensor @xmath17 and the coupling constant @xmath38 related to the low energy cosmological constant @xmath38 by the rescaling described above .",
    "the potential term s relative simplicity in @xmath0-dimensional projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity further motivates our initially studying this case .",
    "the equations of motion derived from variation of the action with respect to the spatial metric tensor are independent of the coupling constant @xmath45 : for @xmath41 the @xmath46 term is a total derivative , and the gauss - bonnet theorem determines its integral over a spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 of the preferred foliation in terms of the euler number of @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the equations of motion obtained from variation of the action with respect to the shift vector are also insensitive to @xmath45 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath45 does , however , appear in the equation of motion derived from variation of the action with respect to the lapse function .",
    "since the lapse function only depends on the time coordinate , its equation of motion takes the form of a spatially integrated hamiltonian constraint @xmath47 for the global hamiltonian @xmath48.\\ ] ]    at this stage there is an additional choice to make beyond that of restricting to projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "recall the distinction that arises between noncompact and compact spatial topology when imposing the local hamiltonian constraint in relativistic theories of gravity . in the former case , after imposing appropriate asymptotic fall - off conditions and accounting for possible boundary contributions , the zero mode @xmath49 of the local hamiltonian constraint does not vanish on physical states . instead , this mode is one of the conserved asymptotic charges , namely the total energy . in the latter case the zero mode @xmath49 of the local hamiltonian constraint vanishes on all physical states since the relativistic gauge symmetries mix it together with the other gauge symmetry generators .",
    "now , in hoava - lifshitz gravity , as pointed out in @xcite , this situation is somewhat different : while the case of noncompact spatial topology remains essentially unchanged , a novelty arises in the case of compact spatial topology .",
    "imposing the vanishing of @xmath50 on physical states is not mandatory : either one may treat @xmath50 as a gauge symmetry generator and thus impose the condition @xmath51 , or one may treat @xmath49 as a conserved global charge measuring the energy levels of physical states in the hilbert space .",
    "of course , the second option requires us to check that this hamiltonian s spectrum is bounded from below on physical states .",
    "this novel situation was explicitly encountered in @xcite whose authors constructed from bosonic systems on a rigid lattice the renormalization group fixed points corresponding to the free field limit of hoava - lifshitz gravity with @xmath42 and @xmath52 . there",
    "the specific choices that one could make at the level of the microscopic lattice hamiltonian gave rise to the option of imposing or not imposing the condition @xmath53 for the effective low energy gravitons .    when we discretize the action in section [ discreteaction ] for use as a functional on simplicial manifolds , we find that the second option  treating @xmath49 as a conserved global charge  appears more natural in the setting of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "the geometric restrictions derived by employing simplices of fixed edge lengths suggest that the lapse function has been effectively set to a constant , though without leading in any discernible way to the imposition of the constraint .",
    "also , the @xmath46 term with coupling constant @xmath45 in the action does not affect any observables for the topological reasons stated above .",
    "the value of @xmath50 does , however , depend on @xmath45 , which suggests that enforcing the constraint is not completely consistent . in section [ physsemi ] , where we compare",
    "the geometries emerging from our numerical simulations to the classical solutions for the constraint not imposed , we find evidence supporting our selection of the second option .",
    "these comparisons are , moreover , not without weight : as briefly discussed in @xcite and further demonstrated in @xcite , the classical phase diagram for the theory with variable lapse differs significantly from that of the present setting . the classical theory that we quantize in section [ results ]",
    "is thus defined by the action for fixed lapse .",
    "the causal dynamical triangulations approach aspires to define the continuum limit of a quantum theory of gravity by appealing solely to those nonperturbative tools applied with great success to the quantization of local gauge field theories .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews . ) in particular , the approach invokes a lattice regularization of the path integral for gravity and then utilizes the renormalization group to explore its continuum limit . in causal dynamical triangulations",
    "one thus attempts to define this path integral as the partition function of a statistical model of dynamical geometry .",
    "( see @xcite for recent reviews . ) as in several previous programs of lattice quantization of gravity , the statistical ensemble of geometries is comprised of simplicial manifolds triangulated by a fixed set of @xmath54-simplices . in @xmath3 dimensions",
    "this set consists of those @xmath55-simplices or tetrahedra pictured in figure @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig : tetra ] - , @xmath57- , and @xmath58-tetrahedra .",
    "the abscissa indicates the number of vertices on an initial triangulated spacelike hypersurface , and the ordinate indicates the number of vertices on the next triangulated spacelike hypersurface.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the novel feature of causal dynamical triangulations lies in the imposition of an additional restriction on the geometries permitted to enter the path integral : these simplicial manifolds must possess a global foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces of constant discrete time .",
    "the global foliation was originally introduced to enable a wick rotation from lorentzian to riemannian signature .",
    "the causal structure of a lorentzian triangulation could thus be faithfully retained in its wick rotated version , only the latter triangulation being amenable to numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "a simplicial manifold is endowed with the foliation structure as follows : every spacelike hypersurface , all of a chosen fixed topology , is triangulated with equilateral @xmath24-simplices , and then the vertices of adjacent spacelike hypersurfaces are connected by timelike edges so as to produce only the @xmath54-simplices of the fixed set .",

    "the measure factor @xmath80 is the inverse of the order of the automorphism group of @xmath70 , included to account for discrete symmetries arising in the structure of @xmath70 .    before proceeding further with our discussion of causal dynamical triangulations ,",
    "we make a few clarifying remarks on the implications of the above prescription for regularizing the continuum path integral .",
    "the restriction to simplicial manifolds admitting a preferred foliation effectively changes the path integral measure and integration domain .",
    "even though we continue to employ the regge action , these changes may result in our model belonging to a universality class different from that of euclidean dynamical triangulations . in @xmath81 dimensions , where the path sum can be evaluated analytically ,",
    "this is known to be the case @xcite : by preventing the birth of baby universes , the foliation requirement alters the critical exponents , indicating that euclidean and causal dynamical triangulations occupy different universality classes . in higher dimensions",
    "the same situation seems very likely to hold true ; otherwise , we should expect our model to fall into one of the universality classes in which no smooth macroscopic limit exists , and the spacetime geometry exhibits a branched polymer or crumpled behavior .",
    "the change in the path integral measure and integration domain may also translate into a change in our theory s effective action such that it no longer assumes the general relativistic form . recall that , although we may locally treat the choice of a preferred foliation as a gauge choice , we can not generally make such a choice globally .",
    "a gauge choice typically introduces a jacobian into the path integral measure , and a mismatch between the path integral measure and the gauge choice can lead to a breaking of the gauge symmetry . starting with the regge action",
    ", the question of whether counterterms sensitive to the preferred foliation are generated thus remains open .",
    "if such counterterms appear , then the resulting effective action likely corresponds to hoava - lifshitz gravity at some particular values of its couplings . the regge action s bare coupling constants @xmath82 and @xmath38 are only indirectly related to the continuum renormalized values of the newton constant and the cosmological constant at long distances , so we must not naively identify the former with the latter .    continuing with our discussion of causal dynamical triangulations , the action simplifies considerably for the simplicial manifolds contributing to our ensemble since only a small set of simplices with fixed geometries is used to construct them .",
    "still , the path sum has resisted all attempts at analytical computation for @xmath83 , so exploration of its properties has primarily employed numerical techniques . in particular , markov chain monte carlo methods are used to simulate the path sum @xcite . to render the path sum amenable to such analysis , we must first wick rotate the real time action to imaginary time , a well - defined process owing to the foliated structure of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "we perform the wick rotation by analytically continuing the parameter @xmath62 in the lower half complex plane @xcite .",
    "for our case of interest@xmath3 dimensions with spacelike hypersurfaces having the topology of @xmath84 and periodic time coordinate having the topology of the @xmath56-sphere @xmath85the regge action becomes @xmath86 after wick rotation and application of various topological relations for @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath88 is the number of vertices and @xmath89 is the number @xmath55-simplices in the triangulation @xmath70 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath90 and @xmath91 are related to the bare couplings @xmath37 and @xmath38 as    @xmath92    we have thus transformed the path sum into the statistical partition function @xmath93=\\sum_{\\mathcal{t}}\\frac{1}{c_{\\mathcal{t}}}\\,e^{-s_{cdt}^{(e)}[\\mathcal{t}]}.\\ ] ]    computer simulations of the partition function in both @xmath3 and @xmath2 dimensions have thus far provided considerable support for the existence of an extended phase of geometry possessing not only a semiclassical limit on large scales , but also a quantum regime on small scales @xcite . in particular , the average observed geometry matches well that of ( possibly deformed ) euclidean de sitter spacetime at both the classical and semiclassical levels @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies of the spectral dimension of this extended phase of geometry have revealed an apparent dimensional reduction to effective @xmath1-dimensionality on small scales @xcite .",
    "this phenomena of dynamical dimensional reduction  particularly , the extrapolated value of the minimal dimensionality  has elicited comparisons of causal dynamical triangulations to both the asymptotic safety approach and hoava - lifshitz gravity . in the former theory",
    "the effective change in the spectral dimension apparently results from large anomalous dimensions near the nontrivial fixed point , while in the latter theory the spectral dimension flows to the short distance value of 2 as a result of the anisotropic scaling near the gaussian fixed point @xcite .",
    "further evidence for such dimensional reduction has also surfaced in other approaches to the quantization of general relativity @xcite .    as in euclidean dynamical triangulations ,",
    "additional phases of geometry also emerge @xcite . at first",
    "these phases were viewed as unphysical , but current interpretations favor their role as further phases in the vicinity of a multicritical fixed point @xcite . specifically , in both @xmath94 and @xmath2 dimensions there exists a phase characterized by spacelike hypersurfaces that effectively decouple from one another @xcite , and in @xmath2 dimensions a second additional phase , distinguished by its large hausdorff dimension , appears @xcite . recently , ambjrn _ et al _ have argued that the transition between this last phase and the physical phase is of second order @xcite .",
    "this finding raises the possibility of rigorously defining a continuum limit of causal dynamical triangulations .",
    "we now derive a discrete form of the action suitable for analysis with the techniques of causal dynamical triangulations . as above",
    "we assume a topology of @xmath95 , primarily motivated by the relative ease of numerically analyzing such compact spacetimes . as in the lattice regularizations of local quantum field theories",
    "@xcite , the precise details of the discretization do not matter since universality ensures that many of the details at the lattice spacing scale become irrelevant in the long distance limit .",
    "our primary goal in constructing a discrete analogue of the action is thus to build an action sufficiently specific so that the continuum limit lies in the universality class of hoava - lifshitz gravity yet sufficiently generic so that the continuum limit does not depend on all of the renormalized coupling constants in this universality class . of course",
    ", we can only judge whether or not we have achieved these goals once we have thoroughly studied the quantum theory of the model defined below .    working from the continuum action , we allow two technical criteria to guide our construction of its discrete version : first , the discrete action should manifestly reduce to the regge action used in causal dynamical triangulations when the bare coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath63 assume their general relativistic values , and , second , the transfer matrix corresponding to the discrete action defined on the space of boundary geometries should yield a well - defined hamiltonian .",
    "these two criteria apply to the classical discrete action constructed below . in the quantum theory defined via the path integral based on this action",
    ", we naturally anticipate a nontrivial relationship between the bare coupling constants and the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "depending on this relationship , the quantum theory s long distance continuum limit may or may not be relativistic .    to implement the first criterion",

    "we use the discrete action for the einstein - hilbert portion of the action , leaving us the task of determining the discrete analogues of the @xmath98 and @xmath99 terms .",
    "we construct these terms below , postponing discussion of the second criterion .",
    "there exist well - established prescriptions for constructing the ricci scalar and the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor in regge calculus .",
    "the former is defined in terms of deficit angles @xmath78 about @xmath76-dimensional hinges @xmath75 of a @xmath54-dimensional simplicial manifold @xcite : @xmath100 the latter is defined in terms of angles @xmath101 between the normal vectors to the two @xmath24-simplices intersecting at the @xmath76-dimensional hinge @xmath75 within the spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 of a @xmath54-dimensional simplicial manifold @xcite : @xmath102 technically , these curvatures have a distributional definition on the hinges , which complicates the construction of curvature squared terms .",
