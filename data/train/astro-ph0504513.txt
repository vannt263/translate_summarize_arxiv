    "the detection of the @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) and @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) emission lines of vibrationally excited h@xmath0 near 4.0  @xmath1 m was recently reported by brittain & rettig ( 2002 ; hereafter br02 ) toward the nearby star hd  141569a . apart from a highly tentative detection of h@xmath0 in sn1987a ( miller et al .",
    "1992 ) , this is the first claim of h@xmath0 _ in emission _ from beyond the solar system .",
    "hd  141569a is a young star with a debris disk that has been extensively observed in the visible to mid - infrared region ( augereau et al .",

    "the lines in emission in the visible part of the spectrum indicate high chromospheric activity ( andrillat , jaschek , & jaschek 1990 ) .",
    "the small infrared excess ( @xmath3 ; sylvester & skinner 1996 ) of the object is comparable to other debris disk objects ( @xmath4 @xmath5@xmath6 ) , implying that the dust in hd  141569a is dissipating and already mostly removed ( malfait , bogaert , & waelkens 1998 ) .",
    "the low abundance of circumstellar co ( zuckerman , forveille , & kastner 1995 ) also suggests that hd  141569a is approaching the zero - age main sequence and is currently in transition from a herbig ae / be star to a gas - exhausted vega - type object .",
    "weinberger et al . ( 2000 ) used spectroscopy of the low - mass companions of hd  141569a to constrain the age of the system to 5@xmath73  myr , between those of herbig ae / be stars and the archetypical vega - type star @xmath8  pic ( @xmath920  myr ; barrado y navascus et al .",
    "the time interval of 110  myr after star formation is critical for planet formation since the building of jupiter - like planets is believed to take place during that period ( e.g. lissauer 1993 ; pollack et al .",

    "miller et al . ( 2000 ) discussed the feasibility of detecting h@xmath0 in giant exoplanets brought into close orbits around their stars , and concluded that detection would be difficult .",
    "the h@xmath0 line intensities reported by br02 are remarkably high compared to those of jupiter . from the equivalent width of the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line , the peak of which br02 observed to be roughly 5% above the continuum of hd  141569a , and the distance of 99  pc to hd  141569a ( van den ancker et al .",

    "this huge disparity demonstrates that the putative line emission from hd  141569a can not arise in a giant planet .",
    "br02 suggested that the line - emitting h@xmath0 may be distributed in a huge gas giant protoplanet with a volume of @xmath91 au@xmath16 or at the inner edge of the circumstellar disk at a distance no less than 17 au from the star , but did not identify physical mechanisms that might lead to the production of the required amount of vibrationally excited h@xmath0 .",
    "the goals of the observations reported here were to confirm the presence of h@xmath0 in hd  141569a and obtain better diagnostics of the physical state of the circumstellar gas of hd  141569a by examining a wide range of h@xmath0 and possibly other transitions in the 34  @xmath1 m region . in the following sections we describe our observations and data reduction , report the results , and",
    "compare them with h@xmath0 line intensities that might be expected in a variety of situations .",

    "the ukirt observations in 2001 utilized cgs4 s echelle to cover the region of the h@xmath0 @xmath10(1 ,  1)@xmath17 @xmath10(1 ,  0 ) ortho - para doublet at 3.67  @xmath1 m , with the 045 wide slit of the spectrograph oriented east - west .",

    "the spectrum of hr  5892 , observed prior to and after hd  141569a , was used to remove telluric absorption lines and provided wavelength calibration accurate to 8  @xmath13  10@xmath18  @xmath1 m rms .    at subaru the echelle and a cross - dispersing grating in the ircs",
    "were employed to cover one - third of the wavelength range from 3.22 to 4.01  @xmath1 m .",

    "the narrow slit ( 015 @xmath13 56 ) was used to obtain spectra with a resolving power of @xmath10=20,000 .",
    "the slit position angle was set to 0  and 90   in the first run in june 2002 ( fig .",
    "the telescope was nodded 28  along the slit to allow subtraction of the sky emission and the dark current .",

    "the second subaru observing run was carried out in the same manner , but with the facility adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( gaessler et al .",

    "the slit position angle was aligned north - to - south , along the apparent major axis of the circumstellar disk .",

    "hr  5685 ( b8v ) was observed as an atmospheric standard star at the similar airmass with the program star .",
    "the spectroscopic flat field was obtained during the night immediately after hd  141569a , without moving the telescope or the instrument rotator , in order to minimize the fringes in the spectrum .",
    "cgs4 was used at ukirt during 2005 march 2 - 4 to search for the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line of h@xmath0 at 3.985  @xmath1 m , with hr  5511 as the telluric standard .",
    "because of poor seeing conditions a somewhat wider slit ( 085 ) was employed than in 2001 , producing a resolving power of 21,000 .",
    "consecutive frames recorded in the dithering sequence at subaru were subtracted to remove the sky emission , and the subtracted frames were stacked together . for slit - scanning spectroscopy blank sky echellograms were subtracted .",
    "the pixel - by - pixel variation of the detector response was normalized by ratioing with dark - subtracted flat field images .",
    "outlier pixels were determined based on the statistics of the dark current and flat field images .",
    "the signals in these pixels were determined by interpolation before extracting one dimensional spectra .",
    "all the above procedures were handled with iraf packages for image reduction and aperture extraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed by maximizing the cross - correlation of the observed spectra with the atmospheric transmission curve modeled by atran ( lord 1992 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the wavelength calibration is dependent on the local line density , but typically is better than a tenth of a pixel @xmath201@xmath21 m ( 0.75  km  s@xmath22 ) .",
    "further processing included linear registration of standard star and the object spectra , rescaling of the standard star spectrum according to beer s law to minimize the mismatch of the airmass , convolving the spectrum to equalize the slightly different spectral resolutions , and finally dividing by the standard star spectrum to eliminate the atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "some of the fully processed data showed periodic wavy features with amplitude smaller than 2% of the continuum flux .",
    "this fringing pattern was removed by discarding a few protruding frequencies in the fourier - transformed spectra .",

    "no emission lines were detected at the wavelengths of any of the h@xmath0 transitions covered by these observations .",
    "in fact , no emission lines whatsoever were detected at any of the wavelengths covered .",
    "limits for unresolved and maginally resolved lines are typically a few percent of the continuum .            the sensitivity of each of the subaru observations was estimated using the standard deviation of the fluctuations in the continuum .",
    "the statistics were obtained over the data points shown in each panel in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] .",
    "the detection limits per resolution element ( 2  pixels ) for the emission lines are 45% ( 3@xmath23 ) for the first run in june 2002 , and @xmath92% for the second run in may 2003 , except for those few transitions having severe overlap with strong telluric absorption lines .",
    "the 3@xmath23 noise levels in the ukirt spectra are @xmath94% of the continuum per resolution element ( 3 pixels ) near the ortho - para doublet ( except on the strong telluric ch@xmath24 complex at 3.6675  @xmath1 m ) and @xmath90.8% . of the continuum per resolution element",
    "( 2 pixels ) near the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line .",
    "the two @xmath2-branch lines in the spectrum reported by br02 are strong enough that they would have been seen clearly in the subaru and ukirt spectra , which were obtained at similar resolutions as those obtained by br02 .",
    "in addition to this , the absences of many of the other emission lines , in particular the @xmath10(1 , 1)@xmath17 @xmath10(1 ,  0 ) ortho - para doublet at 3.67  @xmath1 m , which was not detected either at subaru or at ukirt ( fig . [ f5 ] , upper panel ) , and also not by br02 , are difficult to reconcile with the reported detections of the @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) and @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) lines . in jupiter all of those lines are observed with comparable intensities ( maillard et al .",
    "the @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) and @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) lines originate in ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( 1 ,  0 ) and ( 3 ,  0 ) levels of the vibrationally excited state , respectively .",
    "the accidental doublet , consisting of the @xmath10(1 ,  0 ) and r(1 ,  1)@xmath17 transitions , arises from the ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( 2 ,  0 ) and ( 2 ,  1 ) levels in the @xmath27=1 state .",
    "all known plasma sources of h@xmath0 produce fairly thermal distributions of population , with the exception of an enhancement of metastable levels in very low density media ( oka & epp 2004 ) .",
    "we are not aware of a physical mechanism that could explain the emission from the vibrationally excited ( 1 ,  0 ) and/or ( 3 ,  0 ) states without causing emission from the excited ( 2 ,  0 ) state .",
    "there is a modest bump near the wavelength of the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line in the june 2002 subaru spectrum , which is marginally above the noise level and roughly half the strength of the line reported by br02 .",
    "a possible identification of the bump could be at 3.98546  @xmath1 m ( 2509.12  cm@xmath22 ) , which is shifted by only @xmath291.7  km  s@xmath22 from the vacuum wavelength of @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) .",
    "however , the feature is not detected in the 2003 may data in a spectrum with two times higher signal - to - noise ratio . the ukirt spectrum at the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line from 2005 march ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) could be interpreted as containing a weak and broad emission whose center is near the expected wavelength of the line . however , no narrow line with strength approaching that reported by br02 is present .",
    "the subaru spectra at the @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) and @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) lines are more closely compared with those of br02 in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] in order to examine the possible role of interference from telluric lines . in this figure",
    "the raw subaru spectra are presented , prior to correction for atmospheric absorption , in order to make a direct comparison with br02 fig .  2 , in which telluric absorption features are not removed .",
    "on 2001 august 9 , the line identified as @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) by br02 was found at 3.95318  @xmath1 m , redshifted by 47  km  s@xmath22 from a strong absorption line of n@xmath30o ( 3.95256  @xmath1 m ) , and by 31  km  s@xmath22 from a weaker line of ch@xmath31 ( 3.95277  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the redshift of this line from the n@xmath30o and ch@xmath31 lines would have been 18  km  s@xmath22 and 3  km  s@xmath22 , respectively , on 2003 may 20 .",
    "it is possible that h@xmath0 @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) emission is partially blocked by these lines , but neither of the lines is opaque .",
    "the overlap would have been less severe on 2002 june 21 , with shifts of 34  km  s@xmath22 to n@xmath30o and 18  km  s@xmath22 to ch@xmath31 .",
    "although the intensity of the emission line could be weaker than that observed by br02 , we believe @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) should have been detectable at least at the shoulder of ch@xmath31 with the present spectral resolution .",
    "overlapping telluric absorption lines do not explain the absence of @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) which is in a clean region , let alone other transitions , most of which are only modestly affected by atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "one must also consider the possibility that the h@xmath0 line emission could be extended , or localized at an off - center location of the star and detected only in the wider ( 1 ) slit used by br02 .",
    "both the ukirt 2001 september and subaru june 2002 observations utilized the natural seeing and thus sampled the circumstellar material more or less evenly , without detecting line emission .",
    "the may 2003 subaru observation was assisted by adaptive optics which achieved near - diffraction - limited image quality ( point spread function 01 fwhm at 3.9  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "contamination of the central star spectrum by detached h@xmath0 emission would have been minimal .",
    "the spectra obtained from wide aperture ( 1 ) centered on the star show no significant difference except somewhat increased noise levels ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . from that spectrum",
    "we can only rule out significant h@xmath0 line emission due north or south of the central star in 2003 .",
    "however , at that time we also undertook 5-position slit - scanning spectroscopy within 038 of the central star , scanning from east to west ( fig .",
    "the data were combined except at the position of the central star ( fig .",
    "if asymmetric off - center line emission from h@xmath0 contaminates the central star by as much as 10% of the continuum level as reported for the @xmath2(1 ,  0 ) line by br02 , the offset emitting spot should be very bright and readily detected .",
    "however , no line emission was seen and the spectrum is dominated by a residual flat continuum from the central star .",
    "thus asymmetrically distributed h@xmath0 line emission can not be the cause of the discrepant results .    to summarize , we did not detect either of the two lines originally reported by br02 , at levels significantly lower than they reported .",
    "rettig ( private communication ) continues to detect a line at the wavelength of the @xmath2(3 ,  0 ) line of h@xmath0 with the keck telescope at close to the originally reported strength .",
    "the discrepancy with our data is currently unresolved .",
    "the most stringent 3@xmath23 upper limits to the fluxes of h@xmath0 emission lines searched for here , @xmath9  3  @xmath13  10@xmath32  w  m@xmath33 , correspond to upper limits of @xmath9  3  @xmath13  10@xmath14  w to luminosities in these lines .",
    "these limits are more than eight orders of magnitude greater than those from jupiter s brightest lines .",
    "line emission from a jupiter - like exoplanet in a jupiter - like orbit is not likely to be detectable in the near future .",
    "brittain et al . ( 2003 ) detected emission lines near 5  @xmath1 m from co in hd  141569a .",
    "the emitting co is in a range of vibrational states which they argued are excited by uv photons at the inner edge of the 17  au disk .",
    "the h@xmath0 lines reported by br02 are approximately an order of magnitude weaker than the strongest co lines . in dense clouds , where h@xmath0 is created following collisional ionization of h@xmath34 by cosmic rays , @xmath35(h@xmath0 )  @xmath9  1  @xmath1310@xmath36  @xmath37 ( geballe 2000 )",
    "is many orders of magnitude less than @xmath35(co ) .",
    "one would expect line emission from vibrationally excited h@xmath0 to be weaker than that from vibrationally excited co , roughly by the ratio of their abundances , and therefore the h@xmath0 lines to be undetectable . in principle",
    "ionization of h@xmath30 by uv photons could augment the abundance of h@xmath0 .",
    "however , that requires photons of energy at least 15.3  ev , higher than those that ionize atomic hydrogen .",
    "such photons would be shielded from all but the extreme inner edge of the disk .",
    "thus , whatever process produces the lines of excited co from the circumstellar disk should not produce detectable h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "br02 hypothesized that their reported h@xmath0 line emission could arise in a gas giant protoplanet .",
    "we consider the conditions required for such emission , at the upper limit we observed , which corresponds to 6  @xmath13  10@xmath38 photons  s@xmath22 in a single line .",
    "we assume , as did br02 , that the emission is from a gaseous sphere of mass five times that of jupiter that is 7 au from hd  141569a .",
    "we assume a diameter of 1  au for such an object ( 60%  of the diameter of a hill sphere , assuming a @xmath39 star , appropriate for the spectral type of hd  141569a ) .",
    "the mean number density of such an object is @xmath910@xmath40  @xmath37 . assuming that interstellar conditions pertain for the creation and destruction of h@xmath0 , ( @xmath35(h@xmath0)@xmath910@xmath36  @xmath37 ; geballe 2000 ) , the sphere contains @xmath92  @xmath13  10@xmath41 h@xmath0 ions . the vibrational excitation mechanism for the h@xmath0 is unknown , but as discussed above can not be absorption by uv photons . here",
    "we consider the possibility of collisional excitation .",
    "if , for example , the temperature of the sphere is 600  k , the h@xmath0 would be vibrationally pumped by collisions at a rate of @xmath94  @xmath13  10@xmath16  s@xmath22 ( the rate coefficient is @xmath92  @xmath13  10@xmath42  cm@xmath16  s@xmath22 and the efficiency of vibrational pumping is @xmath44  @xmath9  2  @xmath13  10@xmath45 ) , and would emit with an efficiency of @xmath96  @xmath13  10@xmath46 ( the ratio of spontaneous emission to collisional relaxation ) , so that the photon emission rate , spread over a few tens of rovibrational lines , is @xmath91  @xmath13  10@xmath41  s@xmath22 .",
    "this is roughly five orders of magnitude below our observed upper limit .",
    "thus , even at this probably unrealistically high temperature one would need to invoke an h@xmath0 production rate @xmath910@xmath47 times higher than the interstellar value , or alternatively severe depletions of _ all _ atomic and molecular species with which h@xmath0 can easily react in order to reduce the overall reaction rate by @xmath910@xmath47 . at lower temperatures the pumping rate by collisions would drop steeply and an alternate excitation mechanism would be required .",
    "is the observational limit derived here a useful constraint on jovian exoplanets in much closer proximity to their central stars than the putative protoplanet of br02 is from hd  141569a , or jupiter is from the sun ?",
    "miller et al . ( 2000 ) estimated that a gas giant planet of jovian mass at a distance of 0.05  au , such as the @xmath48  boo exoplanet would have three orders of magnitude higher column density of h@xmath0 in its ionosphere due to radiative ionization of h@xmath34 followed by the rapid reaction of h@xmath49 and h@xmath34 .",
    "one must also add ionization by the vastly denser stellar wind ( 10@xmath50 times denser than at the distance of jupiter ) .",
    "countering the increased sources of h@xmath0 will be sinks such as dissociative recombination of h@xmath0 on electrons .",
    "moreover , in the extreme environment in which the exoplanet s atmosphere is located , it is likely that a large fraction of the hydrogen will be atomic and thus unable to readily form h@xmath0 .",
    "miller et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated that h@xmath0 line fluxes emitted from the @xmath48  boo ( @xmath51  =  19  pc ) exoplanet could be a few  @xmath13  10@xmath52  w  m@xmath33 , a value two orders of magnitude lower than our upper limit , but nominally less than an order of magnitude lower when the difference in distance is included .",
    "however , their estimate did not take into account the effects mentioned above that would significantly reduce the h@xmath0 abundance .",
    "moreover the 25 times brighter continuum flux density of @xmath48  boo than hd  141569a makes detection of a line of even this strength considerably more difficult there .",
    "thus , we expect that the limit on h@xmath0 luminosity reported here is several orders of magnitude above meaningful upper limits for even the most extreme gas giant exoplanet environments .",
    "it is possible that a giant protoplanet , perhaps somewhat more distant that 0.05  au such that a significant fraction of its hydrogen is molecular , could glow more brightly in h@xmath0 than a close exoplanet , but it is unlikely that any such object is currently in the solar neighborhood . in summary , we believe that detection of h@xmath0 line emission from either type of object remains a formidable technical challenge .",
    "we have searched unsuccessfully for line emission from h@xmath0 in hd  141569a , obtaining upper limits significantly below the signal strengths reported by br02 , both for the lines that they reported to have detected and for additional h@xmath0 lines which one would expect would be of comparable strength .",
    "we also do not see any other lines in our data , which cover one - third of the 3.2 - 4.0  @xmath1 m interval .",

    "<S> a search for h@xmath0 line emission , reported to have been detected toward the young star hd  141569a and possibly originating in a clump of planet - forming gas orbiting the star , has yielded negative results . </S>",
    "<S> observations made at the united kingdom infrared telescope and at the subaru telescope during 2001 - 2005 covered 11 major transitions of h@xmath0 from 3.42 to 3.99  @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> no h@xmath0 emission lines were detected ; one marginal detection at 3.9855  @xmath1 m in june 2002 was not confirmed in later spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits to the line strengths are significantly lower than the previously reported detections . </S>",
    "<S> supplemental slit - scanning spectroscopy using adaptive optics was performed within 038 of hd  141569a to search for extended emission from h@xmath0 , but no emission was detected . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our upper limit to the luminosity in h@xmath0 from hd  141569a with that possible from a gas giant protoplanet and also from a jovian mass exoplanet in close orbit about its central star . </S>"
