    "the few nucleon systems can be nowadays studied using realistic nuclear forces in all their complexity .",
    "however , addition of the coulomb force acting between protons poses serious obstacle and is still a challenging task . up to now",

    "( pp ) elastic scattering coulomb force can be included exactly and observables can be calculated using e.g. the vincent - phatak method  @xcite . for three - nucleon ( 3n )",
    "reactions it is possible to include the coulomb force when performing calculations of the elastic proton - deuteron ( pd ) scattering both in a coordinate  @xcite as well as in a momentum space representation  @xcite .",
    "the pd breakup observables can be predicted only in the momentum space using two approaches  @xcite .",
    "both rely on the screened coulomb potential and renormalization , what permits to apply standard methods valid for short - range interactions .    in the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite the coulomb interaction enters faddeev equations via the screened coulomb t - matrix .",
    "this t - matrix appears in a partial wave decomposed form as well as in its direct three - dimensional form for which no partial wave decomposition is performed .",
    "this allows to include the full coulomb interaction , not restricted to the finite number of the lowest partial waves .",
    "since that three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix is a basic component of that formulation , therefore one has to put a special attention to its numerical realization .",
    "precise numerical calculations of the three dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix are possible for any type of screening .",
    "they are numerically quite demanding but in principle use the concepts developed in  @xcite for the malfliet - tjion potential .",
    "this potential consists of two terms which have the same functional form as an exponentially screened coulomb potential with the screening parameter @xmath2 ( for details see below ) .",
    "such particular value of the screening parameter @xmath3 allows one to perform many steps analytically when obtaining momentum space partial wave decomposed as well as direct three - dimensional t - matrix elements .",
    "the analogous procedure can be adapted to the higher values of @xmath3 , as done in  @xcite , where observables for pp scattering were calculated . also there",
    "on- , half- and off - the - energy - shell elements of the t - matrix are compared with the analytical expressions in the screening limit from refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper we present details of three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix calculations .",

    "finally , we summarize in sect.[summary ] .",
    "the three - dimensional momentum space matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential @xmath4 and the 3-dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix elements @xmath5 at energy @xmath6 are related by  @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8    we solve eq .",

    "due to strong oscillations of the integrand in ( [ eq.4 ] ) the big number of integration r - points is needed to achieve sufficient precision .",
    "this significantly increases the computer time needed for the t - matrix calculation , which has to be done on a big grid of @xmath24 and @xmath25 points .",
    "typically , we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation  ( [ eq.1 ] ) using 120 p - points and 190 x - points for the sharply cut off potential and 95 p - points with 130 x - points for other screenings , what requires over @xmath26 calculations of the @xmath15 function .",
    "the integration over @xmath27 in  ( [ eq.4 ] ) can be performed with relatively small number of @xmath27-points and thus the whole numerical difficulty is shifted to calculation of @xmath28 . in order",
    "to speed it up we use the following method : in the first step we prepare the @xmath28 on a grid of 300 q - points in the range of 0 - 100 @xmath29 . in order to calculate the integral over",
    "@xmath21 we use the filon s integration formula  @xcite which is dedicated to integrals of the product of the sine ( or cosine ) with some nonoscillatory function @xmath30 .",
    "the upper limit of integration @xmath31 is chosen sufficiently large so that the integrand approaches zero ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "since the resulting function @xmath28 undergoes changes of 10 orders of magnitude in a rather small region of @xmath33 , it is very difficult to handle it properly in further interpolations and integrations .",
    "a way out is to perform interpolations for the ratio @xmath34 with analytically known @xmath35 .",
    "variation of that ratio @xmath36 is much more restricted , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , and we use its polynomial representation to get @xmath36 at any value of @xmath33 . for each value of @xmath3 and @xmath17",
    "we divide the interpolation region into some optimal number of intervals , optimizing their length as well as degree of the polynomial .",
    "typically we have 6 intervals while the degree of the polynomial varies between 6 to 12 .",
    "this allows us to describe the oscillating function @xmath36 with a sufficiently high precision , what is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for n=3 and r=120 fm .",

    "the agreement is perfect .",
    "the examples of the polynomial representation of @xmath36 for two sets of screening parameters are given in the appendix .",
    "the important and useful feature of @xmath36 , and thus also of the fit parameters , is its independence from the scattering energy . due to",
    "that the interpolation can be done once for a given set of @xmath3 and @xmath17 values .    once the @xmath36 is calculated also @xmath28 is known and the final integration over @xmath27 leads to @xmath15 . in our calculations",
    "we use typically a set of 500 gaussian points for the @xmath27-integration for all types of screening .",
    "the properties of the resulting screened t - matrices are presented in the next section .",
    "in this section the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix @xmath38 will be shown as a function of momenta @xmath39 at given scattering angle @xmath40 .",
    "we choose as examples of backward , intermediate and forward angles the following values of @xmath40 : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the real and imaginary parts of the exponentially screened coulomb t - matrix with n=4 and r=20 fm at e=13 mev are shown .",
    "the real part of @xmath43 has a high and steep maximum at small momenta at @xmath44 , which evolves to a ridge lying along diagonal @xmath45 for smaller angles .",
    "the spiky structure seen for the smallest angle comes only from the graphical representation on the finite grid of @xmath46 and @xmath47-points .",
    "the increasing range of the ridge shows that action of the screened coulomb force becomes more and more important at bigger momenta when moving to smaller scattering angles .",
    "the imaginary part has a minimum at the on - shell point @xmath48  @xmath49 @xmath29 for e=13 mev@xmath50 .",
    "its absolute value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the maximum of the real part . the minimum of the imaginary part becomes deeper and narrower with decreasing angle .",
    "the similar behaviour exists also for other values of the screening radius @xmath17 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath51 fm . taking higher values of @xmath17 leads to a more restricted range of momenta , at which the real part of @xmath43 takes large values .",
    "however , the maximum of @xmath52 is much higher than for @xmath53 fm . also the range of momenta , where @xmath54 has the deep minimum is much smaller than for @xmath53 fm .    in figs .",
    "[ fig15 ] and  [ fig7 ] the t - matrix for the sharp cut - off screening at e=13 mev is shown for two values of cut - off parameter : r=20 fm and r=80 fm , respectively .",
    "the general picture is similar to that for the exponential screening , however , some oscillations are visible for both real and imaginary parts of the t - matrix . for the real part they are clearly visible at small momenta .",
    "for the imaginary part at bigger scattering angles they are relatively large , when compared to the absolute minimum of @xmath54 and decrease with decreasing angles .",

    "the resulting t - matrices are very similar to those obtained with the exponential screening at the same angles .    for the exponential screening we investigated the dependence of the screened coulomb t - matrix on the value of the screening parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we found only weak dependence , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] where t - matrices at @xmath59 are shown for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath62 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( sharp cut - off , what corresponds to infinite value of @xmath3 ) at the same angle . it is seen that there is only small decreasing of the height of the diagonal ridge for the real part of the t - matrix at the smallest momenta .",
    "the minimum of the imaginary part becomes narrower and deeper with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we checked , how good is the approximation of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix by the screened coulomb potential alone .",
    "to that aim we looked at the ratio @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show @xmath64 at different scattering angles , obtained for the exponential screening with @xmath17=120 fm and @xmath3=4 at @xmath65 mev",
    ". at all angles the real part of @xmath64 does not exceed 12% .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath64 is below 3% for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 values what emphasizes the smallness of the imaginary part and would indicate on validity of approximation @xmath66 by pure screened coulomb potential @xmath67 . the differences between the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are biggest for @xmath68 and around @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "it means that in those regions of momenta the approximation of the screened coulomb t - matrix by the corresponding screened coulomb potential is rather poor .    for the on - shell",
    "screened coulomb t - matrix elements @xmath71 obtained with exponential screening we show quality of the born approximation in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] . there",
    "the screened coulomb potential @xmath72 together with t - matrix elements are shown as a function of cosine of scattering angle @xmath40 .",
    "the screening parameters are @xmath62 and @xmath53 fm for fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and @xmath62 and @xmath51 fm for fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the real part of the screened coulomb t - matrix ( solid line ) and the screened coulomb potential ( dotted line ) are close to each other , and their ratio does not exceed 4% of @xmath67 for the screening range @xmath53 fm and increases up to about 10% when the screening radius reaches @xmath51 fm . in both cases",
    "the imaginary part of the t - matrix is much smaller than its real part and becomes important only at very small scattering angles .",
    "the real part of the t - matrix is in all cases somewhat smaller than the corresponding potential matrix element .",
    "in this section we would like to compare the on - shell elements of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix obtained directly from eq.([eq.1 ] ) with its value derived from solutions of the partial wave decomposed lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath73 .",
    "the latter is given as a sum of contributions from different angular momenta @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the legendre polynomial of the cosine of the scattering angle , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 should be high enough to give convergent result at given energy and screening .",
    "the @xmath79 partial wave t - matrix element is a solution of the one - dimensional lippmann - schwinger equation with the screened coulomb potential driven by its partial wave element : @xmath80    in fig.[fig11 ] we show convergence of the result with respect to @xmath78 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the partial wave generated screened coulomb t - matrix is compared to the exponentially screened coulomb t - matrix obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) with @xmath62 and @xmath53 fm at e=13 mev . for such relatively small screening radius @xmath17",
    "it is sufficient to restrict to partial waves up to @xmath83 only to reproduce the full 3-dimensional t - matrix ( thick dotted line ) .",
    "however , the number of partial waves needed to reproduce the full three - dimensional t - matrix increases rapidly with increasing screening radius . this is exemplified in fig.[fig12 ] for @xmath51 fm , where partial wave generated results with @xmath84 and @xmath85 are shown together with the full solution .",
    "it is clearly seen that even taking @xmath86 is still not enough to describe with sufficient precision the full three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix .",
    "this shows the importance of the direct three - dimensional solution of eq.([eq.1 ] ) , which avoids problems caused by very slow convergence of the partial wave expansion for big screening radii .",
    "in this paper we investigated numerically behaviour of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix using different types of screening .",
    "such t - matrix is solution of the three - dimensional lippmann - schwinger equation and is an important component of a recently developed novel approach to include the pp coulomb force into the three - nucleon faddeev calculations  @xcite .",
    "the direct application of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix decreases substantially number of partial waves needed in 3n calculations reducing them to the number of partial waves needed to get converged results in case when only nuclear part of the potential is acting .",
    "the presented numerical procedure enables to get precise values of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix for any form of the screening .",
    "we have also presented behaviour of the screened coulomb t - matrix for different types of screening and for different values of screening parameters .",
    "the resulting t - matrices are similar . only the t - matrix based on",
    "the sharply cut off coulomb potential reveals oscillations , which are absent for other types of screening .",
    "those oscillations cause , that numerical requirements on computer resources are bigger in that case .",
    "the behaviour of the real and imaginary parts of the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix with varying scattering angle is clearly seen in given examples . the range of relative momenta , where the real part of @xmath43 is important rapidly grows with decreasing scattering angle for all types of screening .",
    "contrary , the imaginary part of @xmath43 becomes more localized with decreasing scattering angle but the depth of its minimum grows .",
    "the presented results exemplify , that the three - dimensional screened coulomb t - matrix can be obtained numerically in a reliable way for any type of screening making it a valuable input in three - body calculations .",
