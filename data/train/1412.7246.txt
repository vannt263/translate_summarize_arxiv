    ", we may add new particles to the model . in approach ( b ) ,",
    "we allow a soft susy breaking mass term for the gravitino that resides near the gut scale  @xcite @xmath184 . in approach ( a ) , while doubling the number of quarks and leptons , we invert the mass hierarchy between susy partners , so that the new squarks and sleptons are lighter than the new quarks and leptons .",
    "this works as long as as we increase @xmath185 and have the new quarks and leptons at @xmath186 while leaving their partners at @xmath187 . for approach ( b ) , the mass of the gravitino soft breaking term is set to @xmath188 . to summarize ,",
    "we see that our estimate in ( [ eq - rho - expt ] ) can be used as a constraint of general susy gut models which we hope to explore in more detail elsewhere .    as we have explained in ref .  @xcite the value of @xmath139 can not be taken as precise . specifically , we argue  @xcite that theory we are using for it from ref .",
    "@xcite is uncertain by a couple of orders of magnitude , which translates into an uncertainty of @xmath189 on our estimate of @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , we have addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite three other important matters that we have not mentioned:(1 ) , the effect of the various spontaneous symmetry vacuum energies on our @xmath190 estimate methodology as exhibited here ; ( 2 ) , the issue of the impact of our approach on big bang nucleosynthesis(bbn )  @xcite ; and , ( 3 ) , the covariance of theory in the presence of time dependent values of @xmath1 and of @xmath7 . what we show in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the various spontaneous symmetry vacuum energies have little effect on our @xmath190 estimate methodology because of their small relative size to the planck mass @xmath191 and that our approach has negligible effect on the standard bbn .",
    "in addition , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , while only when @xmath192 holds is covariant conservation of matter in the current universe guaranteed and while either the case with or the case without such guaranteed conservation is possible provided the attendant deviation is small(detailed studies of such deviation , including its maximum possible size , can be found in refs .  @xcite . ) , the results in this section , unlike ( [ coseqn1 ] ) , use the more general realization of the attendant bianchi identity requirement , from which we have @xmath193 to be compared with ( [ coseqn1 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us comment on an apparent ongoing confusion about the uv limit of the einstein - hilbert theory we tame here and the infrared limits of the same theory discussed in refs .",
    "we stress that we have exponentiated the terms @xmath194 in @xmath195 for a massless graviton in the deep uv for @xmath196 which donoghue _",
    "et al . _ and bjerrum - bohr treat to leading order for @xmath197 for the large distance limit .",
    "accordingly , we are completely consistent with what donoghue _ et al . _ and",
    "bjerrum - bohr have found in their respective analyses .    as we noted , the gauge invariance of feynman s formulation of einstein s theory has been emphasized by feynman himself in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we observe the following for the sake of completeness .",
    "the infrared exponent that we resum is gauge invariant as it is the most singular contribution to one - loop 1pi 2-point proper vertex function at the infrared point and any infinitesimal diffeomorphism transformation adds gradient tensors to the graviton field @xmath42 in feynman s notation all of which vanish at the infrared point . since the s - matrix is gauge invariant and we make exact rearrangement with a gauge invariant exponent , our resummed theory is also gauge invariant .",
    "we sum up as follows .",
    "one must note that the model planck scale cosmology of bonanno and reuter which we use is just that , a model .",
    "more work needs to be done to remove from it the type of uncertainties which we just elaborated in our estimate of @xmath1 . with this latter goal in mind , we do look forward to additional possible checks from observations .",
    "we thank profs .",
    "l. alvarez - gaume and w. hollik for the support and kind hospitality of the cern th division and the werner - heisenberg - institut , mpi , munich , respectively , where a part of this work was done .",
    "here , we point out for clarity that in computing @xmath1 in the planck regime the assumption of @xmath23 is presumed as that is the only case for which the bonanno - reuter planck scale cosmology has been shown to allow a smooth connection from the planck regime for times near or earlier than the planck time to the semi - classical frw regime for times after @xmath139 . for @xmath23 , by definition , equal time slices are flat 3-spaces , exactly as we have employed in the vacuum states used to compute the zero - point energies that comprise @xmath1 .",
    "thus the results in sections 3 and 4 are fully self - consistent .",
