    "the observation of absorbing and emitting spectral lines is the most important method of investigation in astrophysics .",
    "for this reason the radiative transfer problems in spectral lines are considered in huge numbers of papers . at first only the intensity of spectral line was considered . the angular distribution of scattered radiation was assumed isotropic .",
    "we remind only some of references in the time order ( busbrige 1953 ; thomas 1957 ; jefferies & white 1958 ; ivanov 1962a , b ; avrett 1965 ; ivanov & nagirner 1966 ; nagirner & ivanov 1966 ; abramov , dykhne & napartovich 1967 ; hummer 1968 ; rybicki & hummer 1991 ) . in particular , the problem of scalar spectral line transfer was presented in book by ivanov ( 1973 ) in full .",
    "the detailed discussion of scalar spectral line transfer in stellar atmospheres is given in the book by mihalas ( 1982 ) .",
    "the allowance of non - isotropic scattering of polarized spectral line radiation is more difficult problem .",
    "the number of papers devoted to this problem is less than ones devoted to problems without polarization ( see , for example , rees & saliba 1982 ; faurobert - sholl & frisch 1989 ; faurobert - sholl et al .",

    "the short review of the problem with the allowance of the radiation polarization was presented by nagirner ( 1985 ) .",
    "the polarization of spectral line depends on the influence of magnetic field ( see faurobert 1987 ; faurobert - sholl 1991 , 1993 ; stenflo 1994 ; trujillo bueno & landi deglinnocenti 1996 ; nagendra et al .",

    "we present here the transfer equation for polarized spectral line radiation in media considering three types particles - atoms with resonant level , atoms without resonant level and dust grains .",
    "these media exist near the centre of seyfert galaxies in the forms of gas - dusty torus and the equatorial flow ( see , for example , the reviews by marin 2014 , 2016 ) .",
    "usually one considers the vectorial radiative transfer equation for the intensity @xmath9 and the stokes parameter @xmath10 which describe axially symmetric problems ( parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this equation ( see eq.(1 ) in the next section ) contains two parameters : @xmath6 and @xmath12 describing the absorption in continuum nearby the wavelength of spectral line and the absorption @xmath13 of the spectral line radiation due to collisional destruction of spectral line per scatterings of atoms with one another .",

    "frequently one takes @xmath39 ( see , for example , ivanov 1973 ) .    the transfer equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "discussed above , describes the radiative transfer in medium consisting of resonant atoms .",
    "the allowance of non - resonant atoms gives rise to additional term in parameter @xmath6 independent of frequency .",
    "usually one assumes that @xmath6 and @xmath13 are independent with one another , and are independent of frequency .",
    "of course , this assumption has an approximate character .    below we consider more successively three - component medium consisting of atoms ( or molecules ) with resonant level , atoms without the resonant level and dust grains .",
    "the number densities of these components are @xmath34 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "we know that the direct propagation of radiation is described by the relation : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the free path of radiation .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is related with particular free paths by the known formula :    @xmath49 @xmath50    to derive the scattering term in transfer equation for resonant radiation , we are take into account that the incident radiation can collide with various particles according to corresponding probabilities @xmath51 and @xmath52 . to describe the light scattering on resonant atoms",
    "we are take into account only the @xmath53 - probability . clearly , the sum of all probabilities are to be equal to unity .",
    "it is also clear from physical point of view , that the probabilities are proportional to the values @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the proportionality factor @xmath56 . the normalization condition - the sum of all probabilities is equal to unity , gives @xmath57 .",

    "this gives @xmath64 .",
    "if the resonant photons collide with resonant atom , only part of them - @xmath65 , undergoes the resonant scattering .",
    "thus , the total probability to undergo the resonant scattering is equal to production :    @xmath66    @xmath67 as a result , we obtain the following radiative transfer equation for spectral line : @xmath22 @xmath68 @xmath69 here we take @xmath70 ; @xmath1 describes the shape of the line ( see below ) , @xmath0 is dimensionless extinction factor .",

    "note , that for the polarization the difference is higher .    thus , we can not assume that the @xmath79 - factor is independent of frequency .",
    "real parameters independent of frequency are @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is important that the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 appear in radiative transfer equation ( 5 ) as a sum @xmath80 .",
    "this is quite naturally because both parameters have the same physical meaning - they describe absorption of the line intensity by various mechanisms .",
    "note , that frequently one consideres the case of the absence of absorption ( @xmath81 ) . in this case",
    "the equation ( 5 ) coincides with equation ( 1 ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath81 are taken .",
    "the cross - section of resonant scattering in optical range is of the order @xmath83 @xmath84 ( see , for example , gasiorovich 1996 ) .",

    "remind , that the thomson cross - section of scattering on free electrons is @xmath86 @xmath84 , larger than atom s cross - section . the cross - section @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the radius of a grain .",
    "this means that the factor @xmath89 is very small compared with the term @xmath90 , if the number density of non - resonant atoms is not much higher than the number density of grains .",
    "usually such inequality does not hold and the term @xmath89 can not be taken into account .",

    "the value @xmath99 depends on widths of the atomic energy levels .",
