    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "2002 ) show near - complete absorption of flux at wavelengths short - ward of lyman-@xmath3 ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) , indicating that the universe is optically thick to this line , and that the neutral fraction of hydrogen is much greater than at lower redshifts .",
    "initial cosmic microwave background results from the _ wmap _ satellite indicated that the universe was completely neutral at redshifts of @xmath23 ( kogut et al .",
    "there is an ongoing debate as to what reionized the universe at @xmath25 : is it agn or ionizing photons ( produced in hot , massive , short - lived stars ) escaping from star forming galaxies ?",
    "along with the escape fraction for these ionizing photons , it is crucial to know the global star formation rate at this epoch .",
    "here we detail our work in identifying star - forming galaxies within the first billion years of the big bang through deep imaging with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. our selection method is based on the lyman break technique , and we have shown this is effective in isolating @xmath1 by obtaining spectroscopic confirmation with the 10-m keck telescopes .",
    "our analysis of the _ hubble ultra deep field _ ( the deepest images ever obtained ) enables us to explore the faint end of the luminosity function ( the bulk of galaxies with low star formation rates ) .",
    "our discovery of this @xmath0-drop galaxy population is used to infer the global star formation rate density at this epoch ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we consider the implications for reionization of the uv flux from these galaxies .",
    "we also use infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ to determine the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of our @xmath0-drops , and constrain the previous star formation histories of these sources .    throughout",
    "we adopt the standard `` concordance '' cosmology of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and use @xmath28 .",
    "all magnitudes are on the @xmath29 system .",
    "in order to select @xmath1 galaxies , we use the `` lyman break technique '' pioneered at @xmath30 using ground - based telescopes by steidel and co - workers ( steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) and using _ hst _ by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . at @xmath31",
    ", we can efficiently use only two filters , above ( @xmath2-band 9000 ) and below ( @xmath0-band 8000 ) the continuum break at lyman-@xmath3 line ( @xmath32 ) since the integrated optical depth of the lyman-@xmath3 forest is @xmath33 ( see figure  [ fig : filters ] ) and there is essentially no flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the key issue is to work at a sufficiently - high signal - to - noise ratio that lyman break `` drop - out '' galaxies can be safely identified through detection in a single redder band ( i.e. , @xmath2-band ) .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated to be effective by the sdss collaboration in the detection of @xmath1 qsos using the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bands alone ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , using wide - area but shallow ground - based imaging ( sensitive to bright but rare quasars ) .",
    "our group has analysed deep imaging from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ with the same sharp - sided sdss f775w ( @xmath0 ) and f850lp ( @xmath2 ) filters to locate the``@xmath6-drops '' which are candidate @xmath1 galaxies ( fainter but more numerous than the qsos ) . in figures  [ fig : tracks]&[fig : izzcolmag ] we illustrate how a colour cut of @xmath34 can be effective in selecting sources with @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig : tracks ]    we have analysed the acs images from the _ hst _ treasury `` great observatory origins deep survey '' ( goods ; giavalisco & dickinson 2003 ) to discover this @xmath0-drop population of @xmath1 galaxies . in stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 ) we searched 150arcmin@xmath36 of the goods - south field ( the _ chandra _ deep field - south ) to select @xmath37 objects , of which six were probable @xmath38 galaxies brighter than @xmath39 .",
    "subsequent papers by the goods team ( dickinson _ et al .  _ 2004 ; giavalisco _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) reproduced many of these @xmath0-drop candidates . to address potential cosmic variance issues",
    ", we performed a similar analysis in the goods - north field , which yielded a consistent estimate of the surface density of @xmath17 star forming sources ( stanway et al .",
    ".      the effectiveness of the lyman - break technique has been demonstrated at lower redshifts through spectroscopic confirmation of hundreds of @xmath13-band dropouts at @xmath12 and @xmath40-band drop - outs at @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is important to demonstrate that the @xmath0-drop selection is similarly isolating galaxies at @xmath1 , if we are to use the surface density of @xmath0-drops to draw global inferences about galaxies within the first billion years .",
    "a known possible contaminant is the extremely red object ( ero ) population of evolved galaxies at @xmath42 which can produce large @xmath43 colours : deep near - infrared imaging ( e.g. , from the _ hst_/nicmos survey of the udf ) should identify eros , and we consider this possible contamination stanway , mcmahon & bunker ( 2005 ) .",
    "low - mass galactic stars ( m / l / t dwarfs ) are another interloper population .    we have obtained deep spectroscopy with keck / deimos of several of the brightest @xmath0-drops identified by stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 ) in goods - south ; in the case of sbm03#3 ( @xmath44 ) and , an @xmath0-drop in the chandra deep field south photometrically - selected from hst / acs images to lie at @xmath1 .    for two of these objects",
    ", we discovered single emission lines ( fig .",
    "3 ) at 8245  & 8305 , consistent with lyman-@xmath3 emission from galaxies at @xmath45 ( sbm03#3 , bunker et al .  2003 ) and @xmath46 ( sbm03#1 , stanway et al .",
    "the spectrally - resolved profiles of the emission lines are asymmetric ( as high-@xmath47 lyman-@xmath3 tends to be ) with a p - cygni - like profile and a sharp cut - off on the blue wing ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the line fluxes are @xmath48 .",
    "the equivalent widths are @xmath49  using the @xmath2-band photometry from hst / acs , which is within the range seen in high-@xmath47 star - forming galaxies at @xmath50 .",
    "the velocity widths of the lyman-@xmath3 are comparatively narrow ( @xmath51 ) and we do not detect the high - ionization line n  v@xmath5212140 , which strongly support the view that this line emission is powered by star formation rather than an agn .",
    "our spectroscopic redshifts for these objects confirms the validity of the @xmath0-drop selection technique to select star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , a programme of spectroscopy with gmos `` nod&shuffle '' on gemini ( glare , stanway et al .",
    "2004b ) has confirmed more galaxies in goods - south .",
    "slitless spectroscopy of the udf with _",
    "hst_/acs ( grapes , malhotra et al .",
    "2005 ) has also confirmed the spectral breaks of the @xmath0-drop galaxies , although the spectral resolution of @xmath53 is insufficient to see the lyman-@xmath3 emission lines .",
    "[ fig : madau_plot ]",
    "we base our measurement of the star formation rate on the intensity of the rest - frame uv continuum emission , redshifted into the @xmath2-band at @xmath1 ; this is dominated by the light from the most massive stars ( @xmath54 which are the hottest and bluest stars ) , which are the shortest lived , and hence a tracer of the instantaneous star formation rate . to go from the number of massive stars formed to the total star formation rate",
    "requires an assumption about the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . in the absence of dust obscuration ,",
    "the relation between the flux density in the rest - uv around @xmath55  and the star formation rate ( @xmath56 in @xmath57 ) is given by @xmath58 from madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with @xmath59 .",
    "our relatively bright magnitude cut of @xmath4 for the goodsv0.5 data ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; stanway et al .",
    "2004a ) corresponds to an unobscured star formation rate of @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( the luminosity - weighted average redshift ) , equivalent to @xmath62 for the @xmath13-band dropout population at @xmath12 .",
    "we recover the @xmath1 rest - frame uv luminosity function from the observed number counts of @xmath0-drops to faint magnitudes in the udf .",
    "although our colour cut selects galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath63 , an increasing fraction of the @xmath2-band flux is attenuated by the redshifted lyman-@xmath3 forest . at higher redshifts",
    "we probe increasingly shortward of @xmath64  ( where the luminosity function is calculated ) so the @xmath65-corrections become significant beyond @xmath66 .",
    "we now compare the comoving star formation rate deduced for @xmath31 galaxies based on our candidate @xmath0-dropout source counts with predictions based on a range of rest - frame uv luminosity functions .",
    "for convenience we assume that there is no evolution over the sampled redshift range , @xmath67 , spanned by our @xmath0-drop selection ( equivalent to a range between @xmath68gyr after the big bang ) .",
    "we take as a starting point the luminosity function for the well - studied lyman - break @xmath13-dropout population , reported in steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which has a characteristic rest - uv luminosity @xmath69 and a characteristic comoving number density at @xmath12 is @xmath70 in our cosmology .",
    "the faint end slope of the schechter function at @xmath12 is relatively steep ( @xmath71 ) compared with @xmath72 to @xmath73 for lower - redshift galaxy samples ( e.g. , blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a tantalizing result from our work so far is that at @xmath74 there are far fewer uv - luminous star forming galaxies than would have been predicted if there was no evolution , based on a comparison to the well - studied @xmath75 lyman break population ( steidel et al.1999 ) .",
    "in fact , the volume averaged ( comoving ) star formation rate in galaxies with @xmath76 is @xmath77 _ less _ at @xmath1 than at @xmath12 .",
    "so it would appear that at this crucial epoch , where abundant sources of uv photons are needed to reionize the universe , there is in fact a deficit of luminous star forming galaxies .",
    "we have conclusively shown that the bright end of luminosity function has evolved greatly from @xmath74 to @xmath30 .",
    "other groups have claimed less dramatic evolution or even no evolution in the total volume - averaged star formation rate , based on the same fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) and similar _",
    "hst_/acs data sets ( bouwens et al .  2003",
    "; yan , windhorst & cohen 2003 ) , but these groups work closer to the detection limit of the images and introduce large completeness corrections for the faint source counts . to do a complete inventory of the uv light from star formation we must address the contribution of low - luminosity star - forming galaxies to the ionizing flux .",
    "the public availability of the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ; beckwith , somerville & stiavelli ) can address this puzzle by pushing down the luminosity function at @xmath1 to well below the equivalent of @xmath78 for the @xmath12 population .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) was a cycle 12 stsci director s discretionary time programme executed over september 2003  january 200 , comprising 400 orbits in 4 broad - band filters ( including f775w @xmath0-band for 144 orbits ; f850lp @xmath2-band for 144 orbits ) .",
    "the udf lies within the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "as the udf represents the deepest set of images yet taken , significantly deeper than the @xmath79-band exposures of the hubble deep fields ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , and adds the longer - wavelength @xmath2-band , it is uniquely suited to the goals of our program .",
    "we performed the first analysis of @xmath0-drops in the udf ( bunker et al .",
    "2004 ) , presenting details of 54 candidate star forming galaxies at @xmath1 in a preprint the day after the release of the udf data .",
    "our analysis was subsequently independently repeated by yan & windhorst ( 2004 ) , with agreement at the 98% level ( see bunker & stanway 2004 for a comparison ) .",
    "we take our magnitude limit as @xmath80 ( a @xmath81 cut).we measure a star formation density of @xmath82 at @xmath1 from galaxies in the udf with sfrs@xmath83 ( equivalent to @xmath11 at @xmath12 ) .    at the relatively bright cut of @xmath4",
    "used in stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 ) from the goodsv0.5 survey , the udf data is 98% complete for sources as extended as @xmath84arcsec .",
    "interestingly , we detect no extended ( low surface brightness ) @xmath0-drops to this magnitude limit in addition to the targetted @xmath0-drop sbm03#1 in the deeper udf data .",
    "this supports our assertion that the @xmath0-drop population is predominantly compact and there can not be a large completeness correction arising from extended objects ( c.f .",
    "lanzetta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the acs imaging is of course picking out hii star forming regions , and these uv - bright knots of star formation are typically compact ( @xmath85kpc , @xmath86arcsec at @xmath1 ) even within large galaxies at low redshift .",
    "it is interesting that the level of stellar contamination in the udf @xmath0-drops is only 2% , compared with about one in three at the bright end ( @xmath4 ; stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; stanway et al.2004 )",
    ". this may be because we are seeing through the galactic disk at these faint limiting magnitudes to a regime where there are no stars ( see also pirzkal et al .",
    "we compare our @xmath0-drop luminosity function with the work of madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) for the density of star formation . we have updated their equation 27 for the more recent concordance cosmology estimate of the baryon density of spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and for the predicted mean redshift of our sample ( @xmath87 ) : @xmath88    this relation is based on the same salpeter initial mass function as we have used in deriving our volume - averaged star formation rate .",
    "@xmath89 is the concentration factor of neutral hydrogen , @xmath90 .",
    "simulations suggest @xmath91 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath92 ) for high - redshift galaxies is highly uncertain ( e.g. , steidel , pettini & adelberger 2001 ) , but even if we take @xmath93 ( no absorption by h  i ) this estimate of the star formation density required is a factor of @xmath94 higher than our measured star formation density of @xmath95 at @xmath1 from galaxies in the udf with sfrs@xmath83 . for faint end slopes of @xmath96 galaxies with @xmath97 account for @xmath98% of the total luminosity",
    ", so would fall short of the required density of lyman continuum photons required to reionize the universe .",
    "if the faint - end slope is as steep as @xmath99 then there would just be enough uv lyman continuum photons generated in star forming galaxies at @xmath1 ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , but the required escape fraction for complete reionization would still have to be implausibly high ( @xmath100 , whereas all high-@xmath47 measurements to date indicate @xmath101 : fernnadez - soto , lanzetta & chen 2003 ; steidel , adelberger & pettini 2001 ) .",
    "agn are also under - abundant at these epochs ( e.g. , dijkestra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "if star forming galaxies at redshifts close to @xmath102 were responsible for the bulk of reionization , then a very different initial mass function would be required , or the calculations of the clumping factor of neutral gas would have to be significantly over - estimated ( see also stiavelli , fall & panagia 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively another low - luminosity population ( e.g. , forming globular clusters ; ricotti 2002 ) could be invoked to provide some of the shortfall in ionizing photons .",
    "it is also plausible that the bulk of reionization occurred at redshifts well beyond @xmath102 : the wmap polarization data indicate @xmath103 ( kogut et al .  2003 ) , and it is possible that the gunn - peterson troughs seen in @xmath104 qsos ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",

    "this age - sensitive balmer/4000break indicates the ir light is dominated by stars older than 100myr ( and most probably 400myr old ) .",
