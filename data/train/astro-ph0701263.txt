    "the tmt project is currently an equal partnership between caltech , the university of california , and the association of canadian universities for research in astronomy ( acura ) to construct a 30 m telescope .",
    "tmt will have a 30-m f/1 primary mirror composed of 738 1.2 m segments .",
    "the final focal ratio of the telescope will be f/15 , and the field of view will be 20 arcminutes .",
    "sites are being tested in northern chile , hawaii and mexico .",
    "the instruments and their associated adaptive - optics ( ao ) systems will be located on two large nasmyth platforms , and each instrument station will be addressed by the articulated tertiary mirror .",
    "although both seeing - limited and ao observing modes will be supported at tmt , it is clear that ao will be key in realizing the full scientific potential of the  d@xmath1 advantage \" offered by such a large aperture .",
    "the telescope , enclosure , ao subsystems and instruments are therefore being designed simultaneously as an end - to - end system under stringent requirements imposed by ao - based science .",
    "some key system features that will benefit grb observations include :    * rapid response : tmt is designed , as a system , to slew and acquire targets , set up active and adaptive optic systems , and be ready to observe with any instrument in less than 10 minutes . *",
    "adaptive optics : tmt s ao systems will deliver high strehl images in the nir and mir , resulting in a d@xmath1 advantage .",
    "laser tomography adaptive optics will substantially improve the image quality in the visible .",
    "since grbs are initially point sources , they will benefit the most from full ao correction , unlike distant galaxies .",
    "most of the proposed instruments will capitalize on the d@xmath1 efficiency gain and exquisite spatial resolution ( 7 milliarcsec images in j band ) offered by diffraction - limited images .",
    "tmt instruments will be able to address a broad range of grb science topics , including :    \\a ) identification of optical counterparts :    * wfos ( wide field optical spectrograph ) : very efficient imaging and low resolution spectroscopy simultaneously in two wavelength bands 0.34 - 0.6@xmath2 ; @xmath3 * iris : low spectral resolution ( r = 4000 ) integral field spectroscopy and imaging from @xmath4 , assisted by high strehl adaptive optics .",

    "continuum sensitivity ( 1hr , @xmath8 ) : y , j or h @xmath9 . for z = 7",
    ", nires spectra will cover ly@xmath10 , si ii , si iv , c iv , ni ii , al iii , cr ii and zn ii . * rnires : r = 100,000 3 - 5@xmath2 spectroscopy , fed by a mid ir ao system or by an adaptive secondary .",
