    "the most compact rings ( ultra - compact nuclear rings , ucnrs ) have radii smaller than 200 pc @xcite .",
    "the atlas of images of nuclear rings @xcite is the most complete atlas of galactic nuclear rings to date and includes 101 barred and unbarred disk galaxies with rings .",
    "the dust nuclear rings around elliptical and s0 galaxies constitute a different class of galactic ring with no associated star formation .",

    "note that the term `` starburst '' does not have a general definition @xcite .",
    "a `` circumnuclear starburst '' is a region composed of star condensations with individual masses ranging from a few@xmath6 to greater than @xmath7m@xmath2 , bright in the ultraviolet ( uv ) because they have recently emerged from their birth clouds ( the nuclear galactic ring ) , and contain hot and massive o and/or b stars",
    ".    proposed scenarios for the origin of star - forming galactic rings are galaxy collisions or mergers , accretion of intergalactic gas , and resonances caused by the actions of rotating bars or other non - axisymmetric disturbances on the motions of disk gas clouds @xcite .",
    "note that in their analysis of h@xmath8 and continuum images of 327 local disk galaxies , @xcite found no significant increase in the central concentration of star formation as a result of the presence of a close companion .",
    "on the other hand , there is strong observational evidence for a connection between bars and circumnuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - starburst barred galaxies may eventually become starburst barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "the location of nuclear rings in barred galaxies may be set by inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) , which can prevent gas from flowing further in .",
    "such resonances can cause gas to accumulate in circumnuclear rings where clusters can form @xcite .",
    "alternative models for the location of starbursts in barred galaxies can be found in @xcite and @xcite , while @xcite have a model for the migration of circumnuclear star clusters and nuclear rings .",
    "circumnuclear starbursts in barred galaxies are perhaps the most numerous class of nearby starburst regions @xcite",
    ". their detailed study can provide a stepping stone for studies of starbursts at higher redshifts . indeed ,",
    "local starburst galaxies ( including circumnuclear starbursts ) , show star formation rate densities @xcite , uv colors @xcite , and spectral morphologies @xcite , similar to those of high redshift lyman - break galaxies ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "determining the ages , masses , and stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) of individual star clusters within circumnuclear starbursts is important for understanding the relations between ( 1 ) galaxy dynamics and interactions and the origin of circumnuclear star clusters ; ( 2 ) massive star feedback and the fueling of active galactic nuclei ( agn , @xcite ) ; and ( 3 ) young massive star clusters and globular clusters @xcite . in this study",
    ", we determine the ages and masses , and constrain the imfs of 13 star clusters in messier 83 ( m83 , ngc 5236 ) , which hosts the nearest example of a circumnuclear starburst in a barred galaxy .",
    "m83 is a nearby ( 4.5@xmath90.3mpc , @xcite ) , southern ( dec[j2000]@xmath10 ) , nearly face - on ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) , sab(s)c grand - design spiral galaxy @xcite , with an optical disk spanning @xmath12 ( @xmath13kpc@xmath14kpc ) . @xcite",
    "have estimated that at the distance of m83 , a central black hole of moderate size and luminosity would be detectable .",
    "however , the galaxy shows no indication from radio or x - ray observations of hosting an agn @xcite .",
    "m83 has a close dynamical companion in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 5253 @xcite , which contains a starburst nucleus of @xmath15pc in size ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "m83 s arc - shaped circumnuclear starburst has been observed at wavelengths ranging from the radio to the x - rays ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "it spans about 200pc in length and 35pc in thickness , and it is located between two rings of dusty gaseous material which may be coincident with two inner lindblad resonances @xcite .",
    "the starburst qualifies as an ucnr ( ring radius of @xmath16 pc ) , and as shown in this work , it breaks up into about 20 compact fuv bright star clusters .",
    "two proposed scenarios for its origin are , the interaction of m83 with its neighbor ngc 5253 about 1gyr ago @xcite , and/or the merging of m83 with a dwarf satellite in the past .",
    "the former scenario is supported by the `` finger '' of h i gas projecting outward from the halo of m83 toward ngc 5253 @xcite , and by the presence of off - disk h i clouds in m83 @xcite .",
    "the merger scenario is based on kinematic studies using r band @xcite , near - infrared @xcite , and submillimeter @xcite spectroscopy , which have revealed the presence of a controversial second nucleus , hidden by dust , more massive than the optical nucleus , and located @xmath17 northwest of the latter .",
    "recent n - body simulations by @xcite , which account for this second nucleus , predict the disruption of the circumnuclear starburst in less than an orbital time . however @xcite have concluded that there is no second nucleus in m83 , since they can not confirm the local maximum in the stellar velocity dispersion at the location of the `` second nucleus '' found by @xcite . a third scenario for the origin of the starburst could be internal galaxy dynamics associated with the bar .",
    "the ages of circumnuclear star clusters in m83 have been previously estimated .",
    "based on the analysis of co absorption and br@xmath18 emission - line data @xcite found that the northwestern end of m83 s starburst is the youngest , while the southeastern end is the oldest .",
    "@xcite compared _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 photometry with theoretical population synthesis models and found that most of m83 s circumnuclear star clusters are less than 10 myr old , with clusters younger than 5 myr preferentially located along the northwestern end .",
    "the statistical analysis of the photometry of @xcite by @xcite confirms the age gradient along the starburst . in their analysis ,",
    "@xcite divided the @xmath19 starburst region into 25@xmath20 angular sectors , and considered the mean cluster age as well as the oldest age within each sector , finding 5myr for the oldest cluster in the northwest and 25myr for the oldest cluster in the southeast .",
    "the above age gradient suggests that star formation occurs in an ordered manner , and supports the idea that the starburst is fed by the inflow of bar - driven material .",
    "if real , this gradient has profound implications for the formation and evolution of circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "for this reason , in this work , we age - date 13 clusters within the northern portion of m83 s starburst , using three different techniques , i.e. , by comparing archival _",
    "fuv spectroscopy of the clusters with semi - empirical and new fully theoretical model spectra , and by deriving the ages from high spatial resolution _",
    "hst_/wfc3 multi - band optical photometry .",
    "although our study does not cover the full extent of the starburst s arc , this does not affect our results .",
    "in addition , we analyze the massive star population in regions between the clusters .",
    "another goal of this work is to constrain the upper imfs of our clusters .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the metal rich circumnuclear environment of m83 .",
    "m83 s circumnuclear h ii regions have an oxygen to hydrogen number density ratio of 12+log(o / h)=9.1@xmath90.2 @xcite , and a corresponding fraction of all metals to all elements by mass ( hereafter , metallicity ) that is intermediate between z=0.020 and z=0.040 , and supersolar ( 12+log[o / h]@xmath218.69@xmath90.05 , z@xmath2=0.013 , @xcite ) .",

    "the fuv data set consists of a direct image and four two - dimensional ( 2-d ) spectrograms .",
    "the direct image is projected onto the mama detector , which has a field of view of 25x25  and a plate scale of 0@xmath27024 pixel@xmath28 .",
    "the spectrograms , one long slit ( 25x2  ) and three multi - object ( slitless ) , were taken with the g140l grating , which has an average dispersion of 0.584   pixel@xmath28 .",

    "5 ) , wavelength coverage for the detector@xmath29filter combination ( col .",
    "6 ) , and extension of the most processed data file available from the hubble data archive of the fuv observations .",
    "the data were partially processed through the on - the - fly reprocessing ( otfr ) pipeline of the archive , at retrieval time .",
    "this included data linearization , dark subtraction , flat fielding , and summing of the repeated observations .",
    "in addition , the pipeline corrected the direct image for geometric distortion .",
    "after processing through the pipeline , in order to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , we added together exposures taken with the same instrument configuration , i.e. , the two slitless exposures taken with the f25sfr2 aperture , which we refer to as the f25sfr2 exposure .",
    "because the spectrograms were taken in either a slitless or a wide slit mode with the g140l grating , the spectral traces have large offsets in the dispersion direction .",
    "therefore , the otfr pipeline did not wavelength calibrate or convert these spectra to absolute flux . in order to extract wavelength - calibrated one - dimensional ( 1-d ) spectra from the 2-d spectra , we first located the position of each spectral trace along the cross dispersion direction , and then used the x1d module ( mcgrath , busko , & hodge , stis isr 99 - 03 ) available in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf , @xcite ) for this task .",
    "several iterations were required in order to find the optimal value of xoffset , which is the parameter used by x1d for shifting a spectrum along the dispersion direction .",
    "we used the absorption feature c ii @xmath30 ( hereafter c ii 1335 ) , for finding the optimal value of xoffset . in our spectra , this feature is unresolved and is a blend of milky way interstellar and m83 stellar components .    for the width of the extraction box we used the value recommended in the stis manual for point sources , i.e. , 11 pixels @xcite .",
    "background spectra extracted from outer portions of the 2-d spectrograms were assumed to represent purely geocoronal emission ( air glow ) from h i lyman-@xmath8 ( ly@xmath8 ) at @xmath31  and/or , [ o i ] @xmath32 , depending on the aperture , and were subtracted from the cluster spectra .",
    "we did not subtract the underlying diffuse light because of its large variations as a function of position .",
    "the direct image and the 2-d spectrograms from the stis are shown in the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_fuvset ] .",
    "panel ( a ) features the 25x25  direct image in logarithmic scale , with the location of m83 s optical center marked with a cross , and the spatial scale marked with a vector .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the long - slit and the multi - object spectrograms respectively , both taken with the same aperture ( 25mama ) .",
    "the vertical band in panel ( b ) is due to ly@xmath8 airglow filling the 2-wide slit ( it is seen more clearly in the electronic version ) .",
    "the ly@xmath8 airglow contaminates much of the slitless spectrogram shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "finally , panel ( d ) features the sum of the two slitless spectrograms taken with the f25sfr2 aperture , which rejects the ly@xmath8 airglow .",
    "no contamination from the [ o i ] air glow is apparent in panel ( d ) because the emission brightness geocoronal [ o i ] is typically less than @xmath33 of that of geocoronal ly@xmath8 , depending on the time of observation and the position of the target relative to the earth @xcite .",
    "we used the slitless exposures for extracting spectra of those clusters falling outside the slit , as well as for studying the effect of rejecting the ly@xmath8 air glow on our results .",
    "the spectral resolution , depends on the spatial extent of the star clusters . in order to estimate the spectral resolution of our spectra , we determined the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the cross dispersion profiles of the spectral traces .",
    "for our point - like representative , gd 153 , the fwhm is 0.09  . due to blending with the profiles of close neighbours",
    ", we were only able to determine the fwhm of four clusters by our method . for clusters 1 , 4 , 10 , and 11 + 12 we obtained fwhm of 0.17  , 0.30  , 0.19  , and 0.23  , respectively , which suggests that the clusters are partially resolved .",
    "since these are neither point sources nor fully extended sources , we expected the spectral resolution of our long - slit spectra to be intermediate between the values given in the stis instrument handbook , i.e. , 0.9  ( point source ) and 48  ( extended source ) .",
    "multi - component gaussian fitting of the c ii feature at @xmath30 , carried out with the peak analysis code ( available at ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/staff/dimeo/pan.zip ) reveals that the fwhm of this feature ranges from 2.5 - 7   .",
    "our field spectra are expected to have the resolution of a fully extended source .",
    "we corrected the cluster spectra for reddening due to the presence of dust in the galaxy and in m83 .",
    "for the galaxy s contribution to the reddening , we adopt @xmath34 @xcite , and we assume the galactic extinction curve of @xcite . for m83 s contribution ,",
    "we ( i ) fitted a power law of the form @xmath35 to the continuum in the range @xmath36 , ( ii ) assumed that any deviation of @xmath37 from @xmath38 , which is the expected value for a dust free starburst , is due to extinction by local dust , and ( iii ) dereddened the observed spectrum until @xmath38 was reached , using the starburst obscuration law of @xcite .      in order to match each cluster with its fuv spectral trace , we started by directly comparing the positions of the clusters in the stis direct image , with the positions of the spectral traces in the 2-d spectrograms .",
    "for this , we rotated the image and vertically shifted the spectrograms until the orientations matched , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fuvmatch ] , which shows enlarged portions of the stis image , side by side with two spectrograms .",
    "note that the slitless spectrograms all have the same orientation , while the orientation of the long - slit spectrogram is different .",

    "[ fig_fuvmatch ] , in spite of the different orientations of the spectrograms , the spectral traces of the two brightest clusters , 11 and 12 , always overlap .",
    "furthermore , as seen in panel ( d ) , the faint spectral traces of clusters 4 and 5 also overlap , as do the traces of cluster 14 and a source not in our sample .",
    "fortunately , we can use the long - slit spectra for clusters 4 and 14 .",

    "the clusters and regions used for the background subtraction are labeled .",
    "for the radial profiles , we first rotated the image to match the orientation of each spectrogram , and we then obtained the count rate at a given vertical position by integrating over the horizontal direction .",
    "the radial profiles in the left and right panels look slightly different because of the different angles by which we rotated the image .",
    "we note that although the peaks for clusters in our sample are dominated by emission from the clusters themselves , diffuse light and fainter sources also contribute to their shape and amplitude .",
    "this however , does not affect the identification of the spectrum of each cluster .    for the spectral profiles ,",
    "the count rate at a given position in the cross dispersion direction was obtained by integrating over the dispersion axis .",

    "the typical ew of the 1640 bump is about 2 - 3  @xcite .",
    "if ew=15  is the typical value for late - type wn stars , this suggests a continuum diluting about 80% of the light at 1640   , and w - r stars can not contribute more than 20% to the uv continuum .",
    "the dilution is caused by the strong continuum of o main sequence and o supergiant stars .",
    "3 ) we omit the geometrical effect of clumps in the stellar wind , but the associated x - ray emission from shocks propagating in the wind is included .",
    "clumping affects the lines from trace ions , e.g. , o vi @xmath571035 and o v @xmath571371 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the strength of the wind lines depends on the assumed ionization balance . while photo - ionization is the primary mechanism determining the ionization state of the wind , x - rays arising from shocked material can be important as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
