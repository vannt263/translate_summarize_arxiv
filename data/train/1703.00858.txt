    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is observed in many different processes and on many different scales , for example , in astrophysics , in magnetized accretion disks @xcite , stellar winds , galaxies and galaxy mergers @xcite , or more generally in processes like magnetic reconnection @xcite and the turbulent amplification of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , experiments on earth also aim at a better understanding of e.g. flow - driven mhd instabilities @xcite",
    ". however , the full multi - dimensional dynamics are only rarely accessible in these observations and experiments .",
    "for this reason , simulations are frequently used as a third , complementary approach or to support the design of experiments @xcite .",
    "simulations of pure turbulence are nowadays possible at very high resolution @xcite and properly capture a lot of physical processes . however , there are still many extreme regimes , for example in astrophysics , where turbulence is thought to play an important role but which are inaccessible to direct simulations with realistic parameters .",
    "this situation is also not going to change in the near future despite the ever increasing availability and performance of large computing clusters , and the advances in numerical methods . in these cases , large eddy simulations ( les )",
    "have been employed successfully in the past , however , mostly in the realm of ( incompressible ) hydrodynamics , see e.g. @xcite for a general introduction and @xcite for an astrophysics related review . in les only the largest eddies , which correspond to motions on large and intermediate scales , are simulated directly .",
    "the smallest scales , which are either not represented or unresolved in these simulations , are reintroduced by the means of a subgrid - scale ( sgs ) model .",
    "in other words , les try to incorporate effects on the large scale flow that stem from the small scales or from interaction between large and small scales .",
    "ideally , the overall quality of the simulation improves with respect to the physical processes that are taken into account .",
    "formally , this is equivalent to applying a low - pass filter to the ideal compressible mhd equations resulting in expressions of the form @xcite @xmath1 for a static , homogeneous and isotropic filter under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the filtered primary quantities , i.e. the density @xmath2 , velocity @xmath3 , magnetic field @xmath4 ( incorporating @xmath5 ) and pressure @xmath6 are considered resolved in les .",
    "normal filtering is denoted by an overbar @xmath7 whereas mass - weighted , favre @xcite filtering is denoted by a tilde @xmath8 .",
    "assuming an isothermal equation of state ( @xmath9 ) , all interactions between resolved and unresolved scales and among unresolved scales themselves are captured by the two new terms in the equations .",
    "the turbulent stress tensor is given by @xmath10 and can be decomposed into the turbulent ( or sgs ) magnetic pressure ( last term ) , sgs reynolds stress @xmath11 and sgs maxwell stress @xmath12 with @xmath13 the second new term is the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) : @xmath14 moreover , the total filtered energy is given by @xmath15 where , by virtue of the identity @xmath16 ( with einstein summation ) , the sgs energies are given by the traces of the corresponding stress tensor .",
    "all these sgs terms are unclosed because the mixed terms , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are not explicitly accessible in an les and require modeling .",
    "this modeling is the main challenge for a successful les .",
    "sgs models have been subject of research in hydrodynamics for many decades , e.g. in the incompressible @xcite , compressible @xcite and astrophysical @xcite regime .",
    "however , work in the realm of mhd and in particular compressible mhd is scarce , see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews . directly linked to this work",
    "are the mhd simulations of ( decaying ) turbulent boxes in 3d @xcite , in 2d @xcite and in the incompressible case @xcite .",
    "however , all these groups use different numerical schemes , e.g. finite - differences or ( pseudo- ) spectral methods , while we employ a shock - capturing finite - volume scheme .",
    "usually , these shock - capturing methods are thought to provide an implicit sgs model as shocks are captured by locally increasing the effective numerical dissipation with the help of e.g. slope limiting .",
    "since this procedure is part of the overall method , these simulations are also referred to as implicit les ( iles ) @xcite .    in the presented work ,",
    "we compare the _ a posteriori_behavior of several sgs model including a nonlinear model that explicitly captures compressibility @xcite .",
    "their performance was previously evaluated _ a priori_@xcite . here",
    ", we analyze a set of simulations of decaying homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with respect to a set of statistical quantities including energy spectra , structure functions and statistical moments of the primary fields .",
    "more details on the numerics and the implementation are given in the following section [ sec : methods ] where we also introduce the different models tested and the setup of the particular test case of decaying compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "afterwards , in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of different statistics such as energy spectra , evolution of statistical moments and structure function .",
    "then we discuss these results with respect to previous work in [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in the last section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in our _ a priori_analysis @xcite we tested three different model families , eddy - dissipation , scale - similarity , and nonlinear models , with different normalizations .",
    "all models were tested against the expressions and where the filtered nonlinear term is not split into additional components .",
    "a split allows to separate different types of interactions between scales : only among resolved scales , between resolved and unresolved scales , and only among unresolved scales .",
    "thus , the previous _",
    "a priori_results evaluated the performance of the models to recover all kind of interactions simultaneously .",
    "this is also what we implicitly expect of the models in this work . for each model family",
    "we identified the best model with corresponding coefficients .",
    "these models are now tested _ a posteriori_and described in the following .",
    "[ [ the - eddy - viscosity ] ] the eddy - viscosity +",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( @xmath20 ) model has the longest tradition with roots going back even further than its formulation for les by smagorinsky @xcite .",
    "while originally developed for the kinetic sgs stress tensor in hydrodynamics , the general idea has been transferred to mhd @xcite , where the emf closure is usually referred to as anomalous or eddy - resistivity .",
    "the names of these functional models stem from their primary feature : purely dissipative behavior analogous to e.g. molecular viscosity and resistivity .",
    "we use the following formulations @xmath21 with the resolved traceless kinetic rate - of - strain tensor @xmath22 and current density @xmath23 .",
    "the strengths of the eddy - viscosity @xmath24 and eddy - resistivity @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 they are locally scaled by the sgs energies derived from realizability conditions of the sgs stresses resulting in @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the resolved magnetic rate - of - strain tensor . in agreement with",
    "the _ a priori_analysis @xcite the coefficients are set to @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    ". please note that the coefficient indices are different from the ones in the referenced paper due to a reduced selection of models .",
    "furthermore , the sgs maxwell stress is neglected as the eddy - diffusivity extension in compressible mhd was found to not match the reference data ( correlations @xmath31 ) in the _ a priori_analysis .",
    "therefore , the effects of the sgs maxwell stress are modeled implicitly by the numerical scheme .    [ [ the - scale - similarity ] ] the scale - similarity + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( @xmath32 ) model originates in experimental hydrodynamics where it was observed that scale - to - scale energy transfer is self - similar up to intermittency @xcite .",
    "formally , this additional scale separation can be expressed by an additional ( test ) filter @xmath33 whose filter width is larger than the original one .",
    "the model is given by @xmath34 and mass - weighted filtering also applies to the test filter where velocity components are involved .",
    "again , we choose the coefficients according to the _ a priori_analysis : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the model allows for energy transfer down- and up - scale and , as a structural closure , aims at reproducing closely the properties of the sgs terms and not just their effects on the large scales .",
    "[ [ the - nonlinear ] ] the nonlinear",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( @xmath38 ) model is another structural model and exhibited the highest correlations with reference data in _",
    "a priori_tests @xcite .",
    "it can be derived from taylor expansion of the inverse filter kernel @xcite and requires no further assumptions about the underlying flow features .",
    "we employ the primary compressible extension resulting in the following model : @xmath39 as previously shown , this model does not require a calibration coefficient _ a priori_@xcite and the prefactor @xmath40 originates from the second moment of the gaussian or box filter .",
    "we implemented the different models in the open - source , community - developed magnetohydrodynamic code enzo @xcite .",
    "the new terms are handled by operator - splitting within the muscl - hancock framework and evaluated with centered finite - differences .",
    "they are advanced in time together with the other fluxes by the existing second order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "furthermore , we implemented a flexible filtering framework that supports different stencils and weights in real space . in order to determine the individual weights , we construct discrete , explicit filters by minimizing the residual between analytic and discrete filter yielding so called optimal filters @xcite .",
    "we optimize for wavenumbers below the filter width @xcite .",
    "the resulting weights and filter widths for a symmetric one - dimensional 3-point ( f3 ) , and 5-point ( f5 ) stencil of the box kernel are listed in table  [ tab : filterweights ] .",
    ".filter weights for a discrete representation of the box filter based on an optimal filter approach by minimizing the residual between the analytic and discrete filter over wavenumbers below the filter width .",
    "the filter width @xmath41 is given in terms of grid - spacing @xmath42 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the time per cycle increases for all sgs models when compared to the iles-128 as expected .",
    "furthermore , two general trends are visible .",
    "first , the computational costs increase with increasing filter width .",
    "for example , the nonlinear model with grid - scale quantities increases the time per cycle by a factor of @xmath43 ( nl - gs ) .",
    "explicit filtering introduces additional computations and is thus even more expensive , i.e. a factor of @xmath44 for nl - f3 and of @xmath45 for nl - f5 , respectively . the unproportional increase in computational costs between f3 and f5",
    "is easily explained by the unfavorable memory access in the filtering procedure .",
    "for f5 the filter is build upon a stencil involving @xmath46 points resulting in many accesses to non - contiguous memory and thus cache - misses .",
    "second , the eddy - viscosity and nonlinear model introduce a similar overhead , with ev being a few percent cheaper than nl , while the scale - similarity model is about twice as expensive as the other two models .",
    "the latter is attributed to the additional ( comparatively expensive , explicit ) filter operations .",
    "nl and ev only require filter operations on the 7 primary quantities ( @xmath47 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the scale - similarity models also needs all filtered mixed quantities ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) which involves 15 additional filter operations in total .",
    "finally , we also tested how the computational costs increase for a no - model run at the next higher resolution ( iles-256 ) . at the level of a single fluid cycle the time increases by factor of @xmath51",
    "however , this does not yet take into account that the timestep is also reduced by a factor of @xmath52 at @xmath53 versus @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the total time required to reach a certain state in the simulation is effectively increased by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "one of the most striking results from the analysis in the last section is that models calculated from quantities at the grid - scale , i.e. ev - gs and nl - gs , and scale - similarity models ( ss - f3 and ss - f5 ) have no measurable impact on the statistics of the flow .",
    "the results for the grid - scale based models are in agreement with findings for finite - difference schemes @xcite and for shock - capturing methods @xcite , i.e. numerics dominate over ( eddy - viscosity type ) sgs models when no explicit filtering is applied .",
    "however this does not explain the results for the scale - similarity closures , which employ an explicit filter . a possible explanation for the absence of any observable effect ( apart from a very short transient behavior , e.g. in the kurtosis and skewness of the current at @xmath56 as visible in fig .  [ fig : evolhigherorder ] )",
    "is that the filter separation is still too small .",
    "physically , this translates to the statement that the modeling assumption of self - similar turbulence is not fulfilled on these numerically strongly damped scales .",
    "another observation concerns the convergence with filter width for explicitly filtered eddy - viscosity ( ev - f3 and ev - f5 ) and nonlinear ( nl - f3 nl - f5 ) models .",
    "the energy spectra and mean quantities exhibit a small dependency on the filter width indicating increased dissipative behavior with larger @xmath57 .",
    "however , this is secondary from a practical point of view because a smaller explicit filter is desirable for two reasons .",
    "first , higher order statistics , e.g. skewness , kurtosis and normalized structure functions , show approximately converged results for f3 and f5 .",
    "thus , the improvements over the iles-128 can already be achieved with the smaller explicit filter and the nonlinear model ( nl - f3 ) while possessing a smaller intrinsic dissipation and being computationally more efficient than the f5 counterpart .",
    "second , larger explicit filters in their current form are impractical for actual les in any case .    due to the unfavorable memory access in the filtering , the computational cost grows exponentially with increasing filter width .",
    "in addition , more and more ghost zones are required increasing the costs even further .",
    "building multi - dimensional filters based on the simultaneous application of one dimensional ones rather than the sequential application could be a potential way out .",
    "even though they are found to be slightly less accurate @xcite , their multi - dimensional stencil size is decreased dramatically , i.e. from @xmath58 to @xmath59 supporting points in three dimensions with @xmath60 being the number of points for the 1-d filter .",
    "alternatively , the filtering could be realized in spectral space .",
    "while the process of filtering itself is then reduced to a simple local multiplication , additional complexity independent of the filter width , is introduced by the transformations between real and spectral space .",
    "our current filtering framework could also be further optimized to reduce the computational overhead of the filtering .",
    "for example , cache misses would be partly avoided by using fixed , compiled - in stencils rather than dynamic ones in each cycle . independently of this , in practice the estimated sgs modeling overhead in a simulation is rather conservative .",
    "the total wallclock time always depends on additional factors than the time spent at the pure fluid level , most notably inter - process communication .",
    "moreover , additional physics present in the simulation such as gravity or chemistry can reduce the relative overhead introduced by an sgs model even further .",
    "all models and filters lead to stable simulations and we did not employ any explicitly regularization . while this comes as no surprise for the eddy - viscosity type models , which are only capable of transferring energy down - scale , other groups , e.g. @xcite , typically find that regularization is required for scale - similarity and nonlinear type models .",
    "these models also allow for up - scale energy transfer and are thus capable of seeding numerical instabilities when this inverse transfer is not controlled .",
    "most frequently , both type of models are therefore supplemented with an additional eddy - viscosity type term which successfully stabilizes the simulations . however , this only concerns ( non shock - capturing ) finite - volume , finite difference or ( pseudo- ) spectral schemes . in our case of a shock - capturing finite - volume scheme ,",
    "the inherent numerical dissipation acts as an effective eddy - viscosity model ( thus the term implicit les , see e.g. @xcite ) and evidently provides sufficient regularization for stable simulations .",
    "it should be noted the present study only analyzes turbulence with negligible cross - helicity . in order to account for cross - helicity effects such as changing cascade dynamics both structural models",
    "are expected to be applicable as presented . while the nonlinear model makes no assumptions on the nature of the flow @xcite , the scale - similarity model implicitly accounts for changing dynamics @xcite .",
    "the functional eddy - viscosity model misses this feature . for this reason",
    ", extensions have been proposed to explicitly capture unresolved cross - helicity effects @xcite .",
    "similarly , all models presented concern fully collisional plasmas .",
    "kinetic effects from low collisionality plasmas such as anisotropic thermal conduction even in the presence of weak mean fields or heating and nonthermal particle acceleration from magnetic reconnection are not captured by the presented models @xcite .",
    "finally , the resolution of the les ( @xmath54 ) in this work prohibits the study of more detailed physical effects in mhd turbulence itself @xcite and the corresponding properties of the sgs models .",
    "for example , in order to analyze the locality of interactions @xcite a much higher resolution is required so that the effects of numerical dissipation can be clearly distinguished from physical ones .",
    "in addition , higher resolution les would also allow to study the properties of the sgs models with respect to how they affect the straining ( i.e. the distortion of small scale vortices by large scale motions ) and sweeping ( i.e. advection of small scale vortices by the large scale flow with negligible distortions ) in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that with increasing resolution the importance of a pure sgs turbulence model decreases as more and more features are naturally resolved .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the free decay of homogeneous , isotropic , supersonic mhd turbulence with different sgs models and without explicit model on various grid resolutions .",
    "sgs models are typically introduced to les in order to incorporate unaccounted effects from below the grid - scale , and to improve the quality of the simulation at lower computational cost .",
    "we measured the quality of the sgs models by their capability to reproduce the results of a reference simulation at higher resolution .",
    "the reference quantities included the energy spectra , the evolution of different statistical moments of the kinetic and magnetic energies , the vorticity , the current density and the dilatation magnitudes . in total",
    ", we compared three sgs models : eddy - viscosity , scale - similarity and nonlinear .",
    "additionally , we evaluated the influence of using implicit- , grid - filtered quantities versus explicitly filtered quantities to calculate the model terms .",
    "we analyzed an ensemble of 19 different initial conditions for each configuration as temporary , transient fluctuations can easily dominate individual simulations .",
    "we find that the simulations employing a grid - filtered eddy - viscosity ( ev - gs ) or nonlinear ( nl - gs ) model , or a scale - similarity model with the tested explicit filters ( ss - f3 and ss - f5 ) produce results that are indistinguishable from an implicit les , i.e. without an explicit model , at the same resolution .",
    "moreover , we find that the eddy - viscosity and nonlinear models with the two tested explicit filter widths , i.e. with filter widths of @xmath61 ( ev - f3 and nl - f3 ) and @xmath62 ( ev - f5 and nl - f5 ) , introduce little additional dissipation on the smallest represented scales e.g. in the energy spectra or the evolution of the mean quantities . finally , the nonlinear model ( nl - f3 and nl - f5 ) improves higher order statistics of small - scale dependent quantities , such as the kurtosis and skewness of the current density , dilatation and vorticity . for these quantities , the results of an iles at doubled resolution ( in each dimension ) can be achieved while introducing only a small computational overhead  less than factor of @xmath63 ( versus @xmath64 for the higher - resolution iles ) .",
    "this similarly applies to the normalized structure functions and is independent of the explicit filter width .",
    "based on these results we conclude that an explicit filter is required in order to obtain a measurable impact of an sgs model for shock - capturing finite - volume schemes of second order . in how far this conclusion holds for schemes of higher order and more dynamic versions of the sgs models , e.g. with dynamic coefficients , is yet to be seen and subject to future work .",
    "furthermore , additional dissipation for the explicitly filtered models is not required as numerical dissipation proves to be sufficient ( if not too high ) .",
    "thus , the introduction of an eddy - viscosity model in these schemes is unnecessary .",
    "however , as the nonlinear model improves higher order statistics , it would be desirable to remove the unnecessary dissipation to improve the lower - order statistics as well .",
    "this kind of regularization is also subject of future work .",
    "finally , the nonlinear model in its current version can readily be used with a small explicit filter in situation where higher order statistics are important at little extra cost .",
