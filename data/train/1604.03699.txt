    "adiabatic control of a quantum system through its adiabatic evolution path allows robust manipulation and high - fidelity state - preparation  @xcite . gradually being recognized as an important requirement in quantum information processing  @xcite , it has been under active investigation in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the best known examples of the adiabatic control methods are the rapid adiabatic passage ( rap )  @xcite and the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite . in rap ,",
    "an excitation pulse with a monotonic frequency sweep induces a state vector to follow a population - inversion path in hilbert space traced by an adiabatic state . in stirap ,",
    "a pair of excitation pulses separated in time creates a population - trapping state of a three - level system and the state evolution through the subsequent adiabatic path ensures 100% population transfer from the initial state to the final state without populating the intermediate state .",
    "both of these methods have been widely applied to various quantum systems including atom optics  @xcite , nmr  @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , superconducting qubits  @xcite , and quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "broadband light sources greatly benefit optical approaches to qubit manipulations because of their powerful pulse - shape programming capability  @xcite . in ultrafast optics , composing the amplitude and phase of a broadband laser pulse provides various complex pulse shapes , and their usage often plays a crucial role in investigating and engineering new quantum dynamics of atoms and molecules  @xcite . of particular",
    "relevance in the context of the present paper is the selective population method of dressed states ( spods )  @xcite which provides a pulse shaping scheme especially in the frequency domain for strong - field controls of multilevel systems .    in this paper",
    "we consider a laser pulse shaping method to embed a local nonadiabatic coupling in the middle of a three - level chirped rap process  @xcite .",
    "the chirped rap makes a set of cyclic permutation transitions for a three - level system in the @xmath0-type configuration : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( for a positive chirp , and a negative chirp reverses the directions ) , when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the excited states and @xmath9 is the ground state @xmath9 , and at the first and second adiabatic crossing points the state @xmath9 is interchanged with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "so if the transition at the first adiabatic crossing is turned off ( with the new nonadiabatic coupling ) , the states @xmath9 and @xmath7 bypass the crossing and the states @xmath9 and @xmath8 are interchanged at the second crossing and the state @xmath7 is unchanged ( i.e. , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "we will show that this type of hybrid adiabatic - nonadiabatic interaction can be implemented with a chirped optical pulse with a spectral hole resonant to one of the two excited states . in our method",
    "the laser intensity is used to turn on or off the nonadiabatic coupling , while in a conventional rap approach the spectral chirp sign is used for the selectivity  @xcite . using the laser intensity as a control parameter brings along the benefit of spatial beam shaping , which enables simultaneous control of multiple qubits arranged in space ( to be discussed as an application ) .",

    "the main pulse induces slowly - varying adiabatic passages ( the dotted lines ) and the hole the rapid change of them ( the solid lines ) near the first adiabatic crossing point .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the temporal profiles of the main pulse and the hole , as shown in fig .",
