    "t tauri is one of the most vigorously studied stars in the northern sky , but the nature of this young multiple system remains a mystery . joy ( 1945 )",
    "used t tau as the prototype of a new class of stars that show significant variability , are associated with bright or dark nebulosities and have characteristic emission line spectra .",
    "ambartsumian ( 1947 ; 1949 ) first proposed that the t tauris are in fact young solar type stars in an early stage of formation .",
    "t tau is a @xmath51 myr old k0 star with a mass of @xmath52 m@xmath6 and a visual extinction of @xmath51.5 magnitudes ( cohen & kuhi 1979 ; white & ghez 2001 ) .",
    "dyck , simon & zuckerman ( 1982 ) discovered that t tau has an infrared companion @xmath5100 au to the south .",
    "this source , t tau south ( t tau s ) , has never been detected at optical wavelengths to a limiting magnitude of @xmath519.6 at v ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ) , yet it dominates the system emission at wavelengths longward of 3@xmath3 m .",
    "t tau s has an integrated luminosity twice that of t tau north , the optical star ( t tau n ) , and shows greater than 2 magnitudes of variability in the infrared ( ghez et al . 1991 ; roddier et al 2000 ; beck , prato & simon 2001 ) .",
    "k - band spectral observations confirm that t tau n is a young k star with significant continuum veiling and hydrogen br@xmath1 emission indicative of ongoing accretion activity ( 2.16 @xmath3 m ; beck , prato & simon 2001 ; kasper et al . 2002 ; prato & simon 1997 ; muzzerole et al .",
    "the spectrum of t tau s rises steeply toward longer wavelengths , shows no photospheric absorption features characteristic to young solar type stars , and shows weak and possibly variable br @xmath1 and h@xmath7 ( 2.12 @xmath3 m ) emission ( beck , prato & simon 2001 ; kasper et al .",
    "2002 ; duchne , ghez & mccabe 2002 ) .",
    "t tau s is the prototype of a young class of stars known as infrared companions ( ircs ) ( zinnecker & wilking 1992 ; koresko , herbst & leinert 1997 ; koresko & leinert 2001 ) .",
    "ircs show significant variability in infrared flux , often have larger luminosities than their optical counterparts , and are rarely or never seen at wavelengths shortward of 1.2 @xmath3 m .",
    "their spectral energy distributions are best fit by blackbodies with temperatures less than 1200 k , which is too cool for a stellar photosphere .",
    "if they were observed as single stars , ircs would likely be defined as `` class i '' or `` protostellar '' t tauris only a few times 10@xmath8 years old . however , in most cases this classification is inconsistent with the ages of their optical counterparts .",
    "koresko , herbst & leinert ( 1997 ) proposed that ircs are relatively normal young stars that are obscured by their circumstellar material and are experiencing variable accretion episodes .",
    "t tau s was first shown to vary in flux when ghez et al .",
    "( 1991 ) discovered a gray @xmath52 magnitude flare in the infrared .",
    "roddier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected t tau s in the j - band when it was @xmath56 magnitudes fainter than t tau n ; this remains the shortest wavelength in which t tau s has been observed .",
    "its near infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is best fit by a black body of temperature @xmath5800k ( koresko , herbst & leinert 1997 ) , and the pronounced level of polarized light in the k - band supports the idea that t tau s is a class i protostar ( kobayashi et al .",
    "however , koresko , herbst & leinert ( 1997 ) showed that t tau s is best modeled as a 2.5 m@xmath6 t tauri star observed through 35 magnitudes of visual extinction from circumstellar material .",
    "the infrared spectra of t tau s shows prominent absorption features of water - ice at 3.05@xmath3 m and silicates at 9.7@xmath3 m , which are known to correlate with the visual extinction through molecular clouds . applying the relations between the optical depths of these features and",
    "the visual extinction along the line of sight suggests that t tau s is obscured by only 5 - 10 magnitudes in the visible ( beck , prato & simon 2001 ; ghez et al .",
    "1991 ; herbst , robberto & beckwith 1997 ; whittet et al .",
    "1988 ; teixeira & emerson 1999 ) .",
    "using speckle holographic observations , koresko ( 2000 ) discovered that t tau s is itself a binary with a companion at a projected separation of @xmath50.@xmath905 ( @xmath5 7 au ) . spatially resolved spectra reveal that this companion ( t tau sb ) is a young star of spectral type m1 observed through @xmath58 magnitudes of visual extinction and that the irc ( t tau sa ) is featureless except for br @xmath1 emission ( duchne , ghez & mccabe 2002 ) .",
    "reipurth ( 2000 ) proposed that the infrared companion phenomenon is a direct result of the dynamical interaction of young stars in a triple system .",
    "based on this hypothesis , all ircs , or their optical counterparts , should have a companion .",
    "in addition to t tau , several irc systems have been identified as triples or higher order multiples ( duchne et al .",
    "2003 ; koresko 2002 ; ressler & barsony 2001 ; brandeker et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "both t tau n and s are radio sources , but the location and movement of the radio source associated with t tau s is not consistent with the infrared positions ( johnston et al . 2003 ; roddier et al .",
    "2000 ; ghez et al .",
    "further analysis of the motion of the radio source coupled with the known motion of t tau s in the infrared has led loinard et al . ( 2003 ) to suggest that t tau sb is being ejected from the system",
    ". however , duchne , ghez & mccabe ( 2002 ) and furlan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found that the infrared position of t tau sb with respect to t tau sa is consistent with orbital movement of the components .",
    "the data show interesting and contradictory behavior , and a definitive relationship between the radio emission and the positions of t tau sa and sb has not yet been established .    in the hope that the significant variations in infrared flux and the apparent motions of the system components can provide clues to the nature of t tau s and the irc phenomenon as a whole ,",

    "n and s , but not t tau sa and b. for the presentation and analysis of our results ( tables 1 , 3 , and figures 1 - 8 ) we refer to the combined flux of the t tau s binary as t tau s. unresolved observations of t tau n and s were also made at the wyoming infrared observatory ( wiro ) .",
    "two high spatial resolution adaptive optics observations of the system have been made at the w. m. keck and gemini north observatories .",
    "table 1 presents a log of the observations obtained for this study .",
    "our spatially resolved observations of the t tau n - s system were carried out from august 1995 to january 2002 . at the irtf",
    ", we used the infrared camera nsfcam , which is equipped with a 256 @xmath10 256 insb array , with the 0.@xmath9056/pixel plate scale .",
    "the k and l@xmath0 observations of the t tau system were made by taking 100 0.1 second `` speckle - mode '' exposures to freeze the seeing .",
    "subsequent shift - and - add analysis produced nearly diffraction limited images of the 0.@xmath97 t tau system .",
    "the fluxes were determined from the total system flux and the flux ratio in the derived images . in september to early october 1999 we obtained unresolved photometry of t tau at wiro using iocam1 , which has a 62 @xmath10 58 insb array with a plate scale of 0.@xmath933/pixel .",
    "for these observations , the flux of t tau s was derived from the total flux by assuming the flux of t tau n was constant ( see  3 ) .",
    "all observations obtained at the irtf were reduced by determining the point spread function ( psf ) at each of the observed wavelengths by making shift - and - add images from a series of short exposures of the photometric standards . the flux ratios of t tau n and s at the observed wavelengths were derived with both @xmath11 and cross - correlation binary fitting procedures using this psf ; the results were always consistent to within 1@xmath12 .",
    "our adaptive optics observations from the w.m .",
    "keck and gemini north observatories resolved the @xmath50.@xmath91 separation t tau s binary . in both cases , t tau n was used for adaptive optics wavefront correction .",
    "the data from 2002 oct 30 were obtained at the w. m. keck observatory with nirc2 , which uses a 1024@xmath101024 aladdin-3 insb array ( wizinowich et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we used the narrow - field camera with a plate scale of 0.@xmath90099 @xmath130.@xmath90005/pixel and orientation pa=0.7@xmath130.2 , as measured during commissioning of nirc2 ( r. campbell , private comm . ) .",
    "the position angles and their uncertainties reported in section 4 include this offset and uncertainty added in quadrature .",
    "the data were taken as 15 images in a 5 point dither pattern in each of the h , k@xmath0 and br@xmath1 filters . each individual image consisted of 10 coadds of 0.18 seconds in the h and k@xmath0-bands with 154 hz ao correction , and 0.3 seconds in the br@xmath1 filter using 358 hz ao correction .",
    "conditions were not photometric at the time of the observations , and the improved guide correction for the br@xmath1 observations resulted from the clearing of cirrus clouds .",
    "for the subsequent data reduction , the pixel scale was expanded by a factor of three through a cubic - convolution interpolation to improve the precision of the stellar positions . the close pair , sa - sb ,",
    "was modeled over a grid of brightness ratios and separations using t tau n as the psf .",
    "the best - fit solution was determined by the minimum variance between the model and the observations .",
    "details of this reduction method are described in schaefer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we also obtained high spatial resolution images of t tau on 2002 dec . 20 during comissioning observations of the altair adaptive optics system at gemini north observatory ( herriot et al .",
    "2000 ; vran et al 2003 ) .",
    "we used the near infrared imager ( niri ; hodapp et al .",
    "2003 ) with the f/32 configuration which has a plate scale of 0.@xmath90218/pixel and an orientation of pa=0.0@xmath130.05 ; this was measured during commissioning of niri+altair .",
    "these observations were taken in photometric conditions , with natural seeing of @xmath50.@xmath94 to 0.@xmath95 at 500 nm .",
    "adaptive optics corrections were applied at a rate of 1 khz for h , k and narrow - band h@xmath7(1 - 0 ) filter observations . to acquire the data we used a 9-point dither pattern with 0.@xmath92 offsets , and the final coadded images summed to 81 seconds in the k - band , 61 seconds at h and 108 seconds in molecular hydrogen .",
    "the images were shifted and stacked using the tsdas.drizzle package in iraf .",
    "the scale was shrunk by 70% , and the data were drizzled into an array that oversampled the original pixels by a factor of 2 .",
    "t tau n was saturated in these images , so the separation and flux ratio of the t tau s binary was determined using tools in the iraf package . the altair k - band image of t tau is presented and discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "we obtained five spectra of t tau using spex , the facility near infrared spectrometer at the irtf ( rayner et al .",
    "the spex instrument consists of a 1024@xmath101024 insb array , bigdog , which has a plate scale of 0.@xmath915/pixel and is used for spectroscopic observations , and a 512@xmath10512 insb array , guidedog , which has a 0.@xmath912/pixel plate scale and serves as a guiding / imaging camera .",
    "the spectra were obtained using bigdog with a 0.@xmath95 slit and a 15@xmath9 beam - switched mode for sky correction .",
    "we used the long wavelength cross - dispersed setting , lxd1.9 , which provides simultaneous spectral coverage of the 1.9 - 4.1 @xmath3 m region .",
    "the resulting spectra have resolution r @xmath5 1100 .",
    "in addition to t tau , we also observed a nearby a0 spectral type star to correct for telluric absorption and instrumental effects and to serve as a psf calibrator to extract the blended spectra of t tau n and s. we removed the photosperic hydrogen features present in the a0 spectral calibrator using the `` spextool '' data reduction software with the deconvolution method described by vacca et al .",
    "in all cases , we were able to obtain good correction in the hydrogen photospheric features using this method .",
    "the spectral images were flat fielded and beam - switch sky subtracted .",
    "for each of the 5 orders in the spectroscopic data frames , a 1024@xmath1025 pixel subarray was extracted .",
    "one dimensional psfs , 25 pixels long , were constructed by median filtering 11 columns in the cross dispersion direction of the calibration star subarrays ( see also beck , prato & simon 2001 and prato , greene & simon 2003 ) .",
    "the spectra of the binary components were determined by fitting model binaries , created from overlapping psfs , to the observed data in each of the cross dispersed spectral columns , constrained by the known separation of t tau n and s. the individual spectral amplitudes were determined by the model psf binary which yielded the best fit in the least - squares sense .",
    "the typical residuals in our psf fitting technique were @xmath53 - 9% per pixel of the peak flux .",
    "after the five orders of spectra were extracted for t tau n and s , we copied these data into a format suitable for further reduction with the `` spextool '' data reduction software available from the irtf ( cushing et al .",
    "the spextool tasks xtellcor , xmergeorders and xcleanspec were used for telluric correction , to merge the orders into a single spectrum , and to clean bad pixels .",
    "we cleaned the a0 spectral calibrator    to flux calibrate the spectra , images of t tau and the photometric standard star , 16 tau , were made in the k and l@xmath0-bands using the guidedog imaging array .",
    "a standard circular aperture photometry procedure was used with an aperture radius of 3@xmath9 .",
    "the total flux and the flux ratio derived from the spectroscopic observations were coupled to calibrate the spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows the final corrected , merged , and cleaned spectra for t tau n and s from observations obtained on 2001 oct .",
    "atomic hydrogen and photospheric absorption features typical of k0 stars are present in the spectrum of t tau n , and atomic and molecular hydrogen emission is apparent in t tau s. t tau s also shows a broad absorption feature at 3 @xmath3 m which is caused by stretch - mode oscillations of water - ice frozen onto cold dust grains . in all observations of these spectra , the water - ice absorption is only seen in t tau s , and the photospheric absorption features are only detected in t tau n. this distinction suggests that our spectral extractions are successful at separating the flux from the individual components in the t tau n - s system .",
    "photometric monitoring that resolves t tau n and s has continued since the discovery of t tau s in 1981 .",
    "the results of these studies are summerized in table 2 .",
    "the data that we have accumulated doubles the number of published resolved observations of the t tau system in the k - band , and increases the number of observations in the l@xmath0-band by a factor of six .      figure 2 presents the light curve of t tau n in the k and l@xmath0 photometric bands . the star has not varied significantly ( @xmath140.2 mag ) during the course of these observations and has average magnitudes of k = 5.53@xmath130.03 and l@xmath0=4.32@xmath130.05 .",
    "hence , for our unresolved observations of the t tau system and for flux ratios of t tau n and s that are reported in the literature , the k and l@xmath0 magnitudes of t tau s are determined using these average values for t tau n with conservative uncertainties of @xmath130.1 at k , and @xmath130.15 at l@xmath0 ( see table 2 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we present k - band ( 2.0 - 2.4@xmath3 m ) spectra of t tau n ; five spectra were obtained with spex ( table 1 and  2.2 ) and 1 with kspec on the uh 2.2 meter telescope in 1996 nov . 3 ( previously published in beck , prato & simon 2001 ) .",
    "these spectra show prominent br@xmath1 emission and photospheric absorption lines of na ( 2.208 @xmath3 m ) and ca ( 2.264 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "t tau was among the first young stars discovered to have h@xmath7 s(1 ) 1 - 0 ( 2.12@xmath3 m ) emission ( beckwith et al .",
    "we do not detect this emission feature in the spectra of t tau n , so we interpret this to mean that a significant component of the 2.12@xmath3 m emission is associated with t tau s and/or its circumstellar material rather than with t tau n. table 3 presents the br@xmath1 and br@xmath2 fluxes of t tau n and 3@xmath12 detection limits for the h@xmath7 emission .",
    "although the k and l@xmath0-band fluxes of t tau n do not vary on a statistically significant level , the br@xmath1 and br@xmath2 emission fluxes have varied by more than a factor of 3 .",

    ". spectra of t tau n . variability and decreased depth of co absorption could support the hypothesis that periodic emission arising from the inner circumstellar disk fills in the photospheric features ( greene & meyer 1995 ; calvet , hartmann & strom 1997 ; prato , greene & simon 2003 ) .",
    "future spatially resolved spectroscopy of t tau n may provide the opportunity to study variable co emission and its correlation with the br@xmath1 diagnostic of disk accretion activity .",

    "these data are compiled from our own study as well as many measurements reported in the literature ( table 2 ) .",
    "the total amplitude of the observed variability is nearly three magnitudes in the k - band and more than two magnitudes at l@xmath0 . in the fall of 1999 ,",
    "the flux of t tau s increased in both k and l@xmath0-bands to the brightest level that it has been observed to date ; south / north flux ratios were 0.75@xmath130.06 at k and 2.2@xmath130.1 at l@xmath0 . in september 1998 and november 1999",
    "we obtained observations of the system over three consecutive nights ; t tau s did not show any short - term variability during these observations .",

    "1991 , simon et al .",
    "this figure demonstrates that t tau s appears redder in k - l@xmath0 when faint and bluer when bright .",
    "this color versus magnitude behavior is expected if changes in the amount of obscuring material along the line of sight to the star are responsible for the observed variability .",

    "the implied extinction changes are large , at least a@xmath1920 magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between k - l@xmath0 color and k - band magnitude implies that a single mechanism is reponsible for a large part of the photometric variability , and the observed scatter in the fit suggests that other processes play a role also .",

    "\\7 ) we have used the motion that we derive for t tau s in the infrared to replot the observed vla positions of the t tau s radio source .",
    "the epoch 2001 radio and infrared positions of t tau sb are consistent to within a 1@xmath12 uncertainty .",
    "we find no evidence for an ejection within the system .",
    "\\8 ) our interpretation is that t tau sa is likely a young star that is observed through a significant and variable amount of obscuration and is actively accreting material from its circumstellar environment .",
    "further modeling is necessary to determine if material in an edge - on circumstellar disk within the orbit of the sa - sb binary can extinguish the light from t tau sa to obscure it to invisibility at optical wavelengths .",
