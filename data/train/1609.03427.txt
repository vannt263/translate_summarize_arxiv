    "air pollution in urban areas poses a significant health risks to the inhabitants , and our capability to predict the wind flow and pollutant dispersion in these areas is thus crucial in mitigating the negative effects of the continuing urbanization .",
    "computational modelling of urban flows is however challenging .",
    "urban areas are characterized by complex geometries , and the air flow is typically fully turbulent .",
    "furthermore , the thermal effects play a significant role , which can not be neglected when trying to understand the causes and effects of the urban heat island . and",
    "importantly , the flow is heavily influenced by urban vegetation , which may block or deflect the air flow , as well as affect the turbulence levels .",
    "it also has a capacity to filter the aerosol particles from the polluted air .",
    "its role in the pollution dispersion is thus of increasing interest of researchers @xcite .",
    "both reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) and large eddy simulation ( les ) approaches are used for urban scale cfd simulations @xcite , however , rans approach is the usual choice when computational costs are of consideration .",
    "thermal effects are often neglected , as it makes possible to use the incompressible flow model often present in the publicly available commercial and open - source cfd solvers @xcite .",
    "range of related tree canopy models were developed for the turbulence model @xcite , and although no specific one is universally accepted , variants of the model were successfully employed for urban flow problems with vegetation @xcite .",
    "aerosol particles are removed from the polluted air by the dry deposition process inside the vegetation .",
    "@xcite list four main mechanical processes playing role in the dry deposition : brownian diffusion , interception , inertial impaction and sedimentation .",
    "this rich background of the dry deposition process is rarely fully reflected in the microscale cfd models . in some small scale dispersion studies",
    "the deposition was not considered at all , such as in @xcite , where the authors cited the negligible filtering potential of the vegetation as the main reason .",
    "other used a constant rate of pollutant deposition @xcite , or various models based on the underlying processes of different level of detail @xcite .",
    "however , there is currently no generally accepted and extensively validated dry deposition model for the microscale vegetation flow problems .    in this paper",
    ", we present the description and validation of a finite volume solver for microscale urban flows .",
    "the solver is based on rans equations suitable for modelling of the atmospheric boundary layer flows , including the thermally driven flows .",
    "the vegetation effects are included in the turbulence model , and a detailed , physically based dry deposition model is incorporated in the pollutant transport equation .",
    "a preliminary version of the solver was used for designing an optimal near - road barrier @xcite .",
    "the solver is validated on four test cases aimed to test different aspects of the model : the air flow and pollutant dispersion over a 2d hill , a rising thermal bubble , the flow through and above the forest canopy , and a hedgerow filtering the particle - laden flow .",
    "the fluid flow is described by the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) equations .",
    "we assume that the flow may be modelled as incompressible .",
    "furthermore , we employ the boussinesq approximation , which states that the variation of density from its background state may be neglected everywhere except in the gravity term , and instead of the equation for total energy we prefer to use the equation for potential temperature .",
    "let pressure , density and potential temperature be decomposed into their background components in hydrostatic balance dependent only on the vertical coordinate , denoted with subscript @xmath0 , and their fluctuations , denoted with superscript  @xmath1 : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . then the rans equations read @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the velocity vector , @xmath7 is the background density at some reference point , typically the lowest point in the domain , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the laminar and turbulent kinematic viscosity , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the gravitational acceleration magnitude . the term @xmath12 stands for the momentum loss in the vegetation , and is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model - canopy ] . in the potential temperature equation , @xmath13 is the heat conduction coefficient of the air , and @xmath14 is the specific heat at constant pressure . the turbulent prandtl number @xmath15 is here taken equal to 0.9 . finally , @xmath16 is the density of heat sources per unit mass .",
    "the turbulence is modelled by a standard model proposed by @xcite , which describes the behaviour of the turbulence kinetic energy ( tke ) @xmath17 and its dissipation @xmath18 .",
    "we use it in the following form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the laminar and turbulent dynamic viscosity , and the production of the turbulent kinetic energy has the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 . the terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 model the vegetation effects , and are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : model - canopy ] .",
    "the turbulent viscosity is coupled to the modelled variables through the relation @xmath26    the effects of buoyancy are not included in the turbulence model .",
    "we have ignored these effects under the justification of our focus on the geometrically complex urban areas , where the turbulence generation by shear overshadows the buoyancy effects .",
    "constants of the standard model are alternated , so that the model can sustain a horizontally homogenous flow over a flat topography without any obstacles when suitable boundary conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : bound - conds ] ) are used .",
    "if that is to be , the constants of the model and the von krmn constant @xmath27 have to be tied together by the expression @xcite @xmath28 in this work , we generally use the following set of constants satisfying this relation : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , although also a different choice of @xmath34 is tested for vegetation flows in sec .",
    "[ sec : forest - canopy - flow ] .",
    "we assume that the pollutant is present in such small concentrations that it does not change the properties of the air .",
    "in that case , its transport can be modelled using the passive scalar equation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass concentration of the pollutant , and @xmath37 is the turbulent schmidt number , value of which is chosen on a case by case basis .",
    "the molecular diffusion of the pollutant is neglected here , since the turbulent diffusion is typically much larger in the atmospheric boundary layer .",
    "the term @xmath38 represents the gravitational settling of particles , and @xmath39 stands for the source ( and sink ) term , which includes the sink caused by the dry deposition on the vegetation described in sec .",
    "[ sec : dry - deposition - model ] .",
    "the gravitational settling term has the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitational settling velocity vector oriented towards the ground .",
    "the settling velocity of the particle of the diameter @xmath42 and density @xmath43 is given by the stokes equation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cunningham correction factor and @xmath46 is the mean free path of the particle in the air @xcite .",
    "for typical abl flow simulations , we use the inlet boundary conditions and wall functions given by @xcite",
    ". we will give the formulas for velocity , turbulence kinetic energy , and its dissipation here to avoid needless repetition in further text .",
    "detailed description of the boundary conditions is given for each test case separately .",
    "at the inlet , the wind velocity is given by the log wind profile , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the friction velocity , @xmath27 is the von krmn constant and @xmath49 is the surface roughness length .",
    "the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation are set to @xmath50    at the ground , wall functions are used . normal component of velocity vector is set to zero , and the wall shear stress acting on the near - ground cell with the centre at height @xmath51 is prescribed as @xmath52 zero value of turbulence kinetic energy is prescribed at the ground , and its production in the near - wall cells is given as @xcite @xmath53 the equation for tke dissipation is not solved in the near - wall cells , and its value is instead calculated as @xmath54      we model the vegetation as a porous zone , described by its _ leaf area density _ ( lad ) profile . leaf area density ( given in )",
    "is defined as a total one - sided leaf area per unit volume . in the problems presented here",
    "the vegetation is horizontally homogeneous , and its lad profile therefore varies only with the vertical coordinate .",
    "@xcite summarized the effects of the vegetation on the air flow in four points :    1 .",
    "it extracts the momentum from the mean flow due to the aerodynamic drag of the vegetation elements . 2 .",
    "the extracted energy is converted to the turbulence kinetic energy in the wakes formed behind the obstructions .",
    "the energy of the large - scale turbulent motions is transformed into smaller scale turbulent motions , enhancing the turbulent dissipation in the canopy .",
    "the turbulence kinetic energy production is increased due to the heat transfer between the plant surface and the air .",
    "the last phenomenom is often neglected as having little effect , however , all other mechanisms should be reflected in the vegetation model .",
    "we adopted the model described by @xcite , which specifies the additional terms in the momentum and turbulence equations as follows .",
    "the momentum sink in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqs-2 ] ) caused by the form drag is given as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the velocity magnitude , and @xmath57 is the drag coefficient .",
    "typical values are @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "viscous drag is considered negligible relative to the form drag , and is not included in the momentum sink .",
    "the source term in the tke equation ( [ eq : tke ] ) reads as @xmath59 the positive part of the term represents the energy converted from the mean flow kinetic energy to the turbulence kinetic energy , and parameter @xmath60 is the fraction of the converted energy .",
    "the negative part reflects the short - circuiting of the kolgomorov cascade . finally , the term in the dissipation equation ( [ eq : eps ] ) is @xmath61 its form was derived using the dimensional analysis .",
    "constants of the model are set to @xmath62 .",
    "the dry deposition is a complex process depending on the physical and chemical properties of the aerosol , micrometeorological conditions , or vegetation surface properties . @xcite",
    "identified four main mechanisms of the dry deposition :    * _ brownian diffusion _ , affecting predominantly small particles with diameter @xmath63 . *",
    "_ interception _ , occurring when a particle following the streamline passes too close to the obstacle and gets captured on it . *",
    "_ impaction _ ,",
    "i.e. a collision of the particle which does not follow the streamline with the obstacle due to the inertia of the particle .",
    "impaction is further differentiated into the _ inertial _ and the _ turbulent impaction _ by its cause . * _ sedimentation _ , which stands for the collision of the particle with the obstacle due to the downward motion of the particle caused by the gravitational force . sedimentation is the dominant process for particles sizes @xmath64 .",
    "we model the dry deposition through the term @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : passive - scalar - eq ] ) . here",
    "@xmath66 is the _ deposition velocity _ , usually given in .",
    "its values differ by orders of magnitudes depending on the properties of the particles , vegetation , and the environment @xcite , and a detailed model capturing this behaviour is therefore desirable .",
    "we have adopted the model described in @xcite and @xcite for vegetation with needle - like leaves and broadleaves respectively , which includes all of the processes given above .",
    "the authors presented formulas for the deposition velocities ( or _ collection velocities _ in their terminology ) associated with each of the mechanical processes , and calculated the total deposition velocity as their sum . for brevity , we omit the detailed description of the model , and refer to the original publications instead .",
    "the dependence of the deposition velocity on the particle diameter when using this model is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : depvel ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     furthermore , the ce increases for smaller leaf sizes .",
    "@xcite state that the range of the size of the hawthorn is between 1.1 and 3.2 cm .",
    "however , even when the leaf sizes are set to half of the value at the lower end of the range , the calculated collection efficiencies are still below the measured values .",
    "this may be attributed to the neglected fine needle - like collectors , such as the leaf hairs and thorns , which increase the deposition velocity @xcite . to reflect this",
    ", we further modelled the vegetation as a mix of planar leaf elements of diameter @xmath67 and fine needle - like collectors of diameter @xmath68 .",
    "the proportion of the surface area of the fine collectors to the total surface area is denoted as @xmath69 , and the deposition velocity is calculated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the deposition velocities calculated for the needle and leaf elements respectively .",
    "comparison of the collection efficiencies calculated with this model and with the parameter @xmath69 ranging from 0% to 20% is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : veg - pc - ce]b .",
    "the collection efficiency rises with higher proportion of needles , reflecting the higher deposition velocity on the fine collectors .",
    "best agreement with the measurement is obtained for @xmath73 .",
    "it is therefore demonstrated that this approach , grounded in the realistic assumption of mixed leaves and needles , is capable of reproducing the observed behaviour",
    ". however , the exact proportion of the needle surface area is difficult to directly compare with the biological data , as we are not aware of any study on this topic .",
    "the solver focused on small scale atmospheric flows in areas with vegetation present was described and tested .",
    "the 2d hill test case showed that the solver is capable of correctly predicting the separation of the flow in the examined configurations , although there were deficiencies in the shape of the turbulence kinetic energy profiles .",
    "this also negatively affected the computed pollutant concentrations .",
    "isotropic turbulence model is however unlikely to predict the dispersion perfectly in any case , as it can not predict the different rates of turbulent mixing in horizontal and vertical directions , which were observed in the atmosphere .",
    "the warm bubble test case proved the applicability of the solver for the thermally driven flows .",
    "the inclusion of the potential temperature equation also opens the way for modelling the thermal effects of the vegetation , which are not yet included in the model formulation .",
    "modelling the flow through the forest canopy revealed the difficulties associated with the choice of constants of the model .",
    "the problem was however less pronounced in the edge flow case , for which the usual choice @xmath31 produced good agreement with the measurements . if we wanted to reduce the effects of the choice of model constants",
    ", we may rather use large eddy simulations .",
    "the subgrid - scale model constants in les have smaller influence on the results , and les may thus produce more reliable results .",
    "finally , the hedgerow test case showed that the dry deposition model can reproduce the measured collection efficiencies well , although it required some fine tuning of the parameters describing the vegetation . in the choice of the vegetation parameters",
    "lies a significant obstacle for any modelling studies .",
    "unless we have field measurements available , these parameters must be estimated , and as demonstrated here , their choice may profoundly influence the results .",
    "usage of suitable methods for managing this parameter uncertainty is therefore desirable .",
