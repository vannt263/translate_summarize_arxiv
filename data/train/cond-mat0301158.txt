    ", the specific heat shows a @xmath4 behavior all the way down to the superconducting transition ( at roughly 1k),@xcite suggestive of a two - channel overscreened kondo effect driven by the f - electrons of the uranium ions .",
    "there are two possible integer valence configurations for uranium embedded in a be@xmath3 host : a @xmath5 magnetic spin doublet in the @xmath6 configuration and a @xmath7 electrical quadrupolar doublet in the @xmath8 configuration , the two levels being separated by an energy @xmath9 .",
    "arguing that the extremely weak magnetic field dependence of the material @xcite excludes the usual magnetic kondo effect , cox @xcite proposed that the observed anomalies instead derive from a quenching of the quadrupolar degrees of freedom by the local orbital motion of the @xmath10 conduction electrons in the material ( with the electron spin @xmath11 providing the two `` channels '' required for overscreening ) .",
    "the proposal has been controversial,@xcite however , and experimental data on the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility indicate that the low - lying magnetic excitations are rather predominantly dipolar in character.@xcite whether the energy splitting @xmath9 between the two doublets is sufficiently large for a quadrupolar kondo scenario to become viable is an additional unresolved issue .",
    "et al._@xcite have suggested that the magnetic and quadrupolar doublets may in fact be near degenerate , leading instead to a mixed - valent state with a novel type of interplay between quadrupolar and magnetic kondo - type screening .",

    "the normal ordering is taken with respect to the filled fermi sea , and the energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 are those of the magnetic and quadrupolar doublets respectively .",
    "recently two of us presented an exact solution of the model , based on a bethe ansatz construction.@xcite a complete determination of the energy spectrum and the thermodynamics was given , allowing a full description of the evolution of the impurity from its high temperature behavior with all four impurity states being equally populated down to the low energy dynamics characterized by a line of fixed point hamiltonians @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is held fixed in what follows ) .",
    "it is found that the line of fixed points is characterized by a zero - temperature entropy @xmath36 and a specific heat @xmath37 typical of the two - channel kondo fixed point .",
    "however , the physics along the line varies with @xmath38 .",
    "consider @xmath39 , the amount of charge localized at the impurity .",
    "for @xmath40 , one finds that @xmath41 , signaling the magnetic integral valence regime . at intermediate temperatures a magnetic moment forms which undergoes frustrated screening as the temperature is lowered , leading to zero - temperature anomalous entropy and anomalous specific heat . for @xmath42",

    "similar low - temperature behavior is observed though without the intermediate regime of moment formation . in more detail , each point on the line of fixed points is characterized by two energy scales @xmath44 .",
    "these scales describe the quenching of the entropy as the temperature is lowered : the first stage taking place at the high- temperature scale @xmath45 , quenching the entropy from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , the second stage at @xmath48 , quenching it from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . in the integral valence regime ,",
    "@xmath51 , the two scales are well separated and as long as the temperature falls between these values a moment is present ( magnetic or quadrupolar depending on the sign of @xmath52 ) , manifested by a finite temperature plateau @xmath53 in the entropy .",
    "it is quenched when the temperature is lowered below @xmath48 , with @xmath54 in this regime .",
    "for @xmath55 the scales are equal , @xmath56 , and the quenching occurs in a single stage .    in the present paper we shall concentrate on the low - energy regime and give a detailed description of the line of fixed points in terms of boundary conformal field theory @xmath57 the low - energy effective hamiltonian .",
    "it was argued by affleck and ludwig @xcite that the low - energy regime of a quantum impurity problem is described by a boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) with a conformally invariant boundary condition replacing the dynamical impurity .",
    "however , to identify the effective low - energy theory characterizing a given microscopic impurity model , such as hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it is necessary to employ more powerful methods , valid over the full energy range , that can connect the microscopic hamiltonian to the effective low - energy theory .",
    "one needs in principle to carry out a full renormalization group calculation or , when available , use an exact solution to extract the bcft .",
    "although applicable only in the neighborhood of a low - temperature fixed point , a bcft formulation has certain advantages .",
    "first , it provides an elegant scheme in which to analyze the approach to criticality .",
    "the leading scaling operators can be identified explicitly , yielding access to the low - temperature thermodynamics in closed analytical form .",
    "these can be matched with the expressions from the bethe - ansatz solution allowing the determination of the parameters appearing in the bcft .",
    "this will be carried out below .",
    "secondly @xmath57 and more importantly @xmath57 having identified the scaling operators , the asymptotic dynamical properties ( green s functions , resistivities , optical conductivities , etc . ) can in principle be calculated .",
    "these results will be presented in a subsequent work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the basics of bcft , with particular focus on applications to quantum impurity problems . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the specific bcft which describes the low - temperature physics of the two - channel anderson model in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) . some important features of this bcft are discussed , and in this section we also apply it to the fermi edge singularity problem for this model . in sec .",
    "iv we then combine the results obtained with the bethe ansatz solution @xcite to analytically calculate the zero - temperature impurity entropy , the impurity contributions to the low - temperature specific heat , and the linear and non - linear impurity magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "section  v , finally , contains a summary and a discussion of our results .",
    "the bcft approach to quantum impurity problems is well reviewed in the literature,@xcite and we here only collect some basic results so as to fix conventions and notation .    the key idea is to trade a local impurity - electron interaction for a scale invariant boundary condition on the critical theory that represents the extended ( electron ) degrees of freedom . in the presence of a boundary ,",
    "the left- and right - moving parts of the fields @xmath58 in the critical theory are identified via analytic continuation beyond the boundary @xmath28 , such that @xmath59 thus , the boundary effectively turns the fields nonlocal .",
    "the consequence of this can be delineated via the operator product expansion @xmath60 we have here introduced a complex variable @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the euclidean time and @xmath27 the spatial coordinate .",
    "the function @xmath63 or @xmath64 selects the _ boundary operators _ @xmath65 associated with the given boundary condition , @xmath66 being the dimension of @xmath67 .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ nonlocal ] ) and ( [ boundaryope ] ) that an @xmath68-point function of a field @xmath69 close to the boundary turns into a linear combination of @xmath68-point functions of the _ chiral _ boundary operators @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , this implies that the _ boundary scaling dimension _",
    "@xmath70 of @xmath69 that governs its autocorrelation function close to the boundary , @xmath71 is precisely given by the scaling dimension of the _ leading _ boundary operator appearing in eq .",
    "( [ boundaryope ] ) .",
    "this sets the strategy for treating a quantum impurity problem : identify first the particular boundary condition that plays the role of the impurity interaction .",
    "given that this boundary condition is indeed scale invariant ( together with the original bulk theory ) , one can then use the machinery of bcft to extract the corresponding boundary scaling dimensions . as these determine the asymptotic autocorrelation functions [ cf .",
    "( [ auto ] ) ] the finite - temperature properties due to the presence of the boundary ( _ alias _ the impurity ) are easily accessed from standard finite - size scaling by treating the ( euclidean ) time as an inverse temperature .    to identify the `` right '' boundary condition",
    "it is convenient to exploit a well - known result@xcite from conformal field theory , relating the energy levels in a finite geometry to the ( boundary ) scaling dimensions of operators in the ( semi- ) infinite plane .",
    "more precisely , consider a conformally invariant theory defined on the strip @xmath72 with @xmath73 the euclidean time and @xmath74 the space coordinate . then impose a conformally invariant boundary condition , call it @xmath75 , at the edges @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and map the strip onto the semi - infinite plane @xmath78 using the conformal transformation @xmath79 ( implying boundary condition @xmath75 at @xmath80 ) .",
    "with @xmath81 the ground - state energy , one has @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the spectrum of excited energy levels in @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the spectrum of _ boundary scaling dimensions _ in the semi - infinite plane .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to determining the finite - size spectrum of the theory . in certain privileged cases",
    "this can be done by direct calculation .",
    "alternatively , one hypothesizes a boundary condition and compares the consequences with known answers .",
    "an example is the _ fusion hypothesis _ of affleck and ludwig.@xcite one here starts with some known , trivial boundary condition on the critical theory , with no coupling to the impurity . for free electrons carrying charge , spin ( and maybe some additional `` flavor '' degrees of freedom )",
    "the spectrum organizes into a conformal tower structure,@xcite with the charge , spin and flavor sectors `` glued '' together so as to correctly represent the electrons _ ( fermi liquid gluing condition)_. then , turning on the electron - impurity interaction , its only effect @xmath57 according to the fusion hypothesis @xmath57 is to replace this gluing condition by some new nontrivial gluing of the conformal towers . in the case of the @xmath86-channel kondo problem , the new gluing condition is obtained via _ kac - moody fusion_@xcite with the spin-1/2 primary operator that `` corresponds '' to the kondo impurity . as a consequence , the conformal tower with spin quantum number @xmath87",
    "is mapped onto new towers labeled by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 ) it is _ a priori _ less obvious which operator to use for fusion . here",
    "we shall instead identify the finite - size spectrum by studying certain known limiting cases , guided by the exact bethe ansatz solution of the model.@xcite as it turns out , the spectrum thus obtained can be reconstructed by fusion with the leading _ flavor _ boundary operator ( representing the channel , or _ quadrupolar _",
    ", degrees of freedom ) , but _ in addition there occurs an effective renormalization of the charge sector_. this signals the novel aspect of the present problem .",
    "a technical remark may here be appropriate : since the boundary scaling dimensions in eq .",
    "( [ cardyformula ] ) are connected to energy levels in a strip with the _ same _ boundary condition at the two edges , we are effectively considering a finite - size energy spectrum with _ two _ quantum impurities present , one at each edge of the strip .",
    "formally , this can be taken care of by performing kac - moody fusion _ twice _ with the relevant primary operator _ ( double fusion)_. this is an important point , not always fully appreciated in the literature .",
    "let us finally mention that there exists another , more fundamental description of bcft,@xcite based on the notion of _ boundary states _",
    ", particularly useful when studying zero - temperature properties of a quantum impurity problem .",
    "we shall give a brief exposition of it in sec .",
    "( iv.a ) , where we use it for analyzing the zero - temperature entropy contributed by the impurity .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , the scaling dimensions of the boundary operators that govern the critical behavior are in one - to - one correspondence with the levels of the finite - size spectrum of the model . in the present case the spectrum can in principle be constructed from the exact bethe ansatz solution in ref .  , but this requires an elaborate analysis .",
    "the reason is that the solution takes the form of a so called `` string solution '' even in the groundstate .",
    "since a string solution is valid only in the thermodynamic limit , an application of standard finite - size techniques@xcite would lead to incorrect results .",
    "one may instead pursue another strategy and identify the finite size spectrum ( hence the dimensions of the scaling operators ) that reproduces the results of the exact solution in the low - energy limit . in our case the search for the wanted spectrum can be carried out efficiently by combining symmetry arguments with known results for the finite - size spectra for two limiting cases of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) : the ordinary anderson model and the two - channel kondo model .",
    "we shall see that the low energy spectrum thus obtained , eq .",
    "( [ mchannelandersonspectrum ] ) below , leads indeed to a line of fixed points characterized by entropy @xmath90 k@xmath91 and susceptibility @xmath92 as required by the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "the fitting of the proposed spectrum to the solution also allows the determination of all thermodynamically relevant parameters in the bcft .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the single channel anderson and kondo models .",
    "the latter is obtained in the integer - valence limit @xmath93 ( with @xmath94 measuring the charge localized at the impurity site ) where a magnetic moment forms , signaling the entrance to the kondo regime.@xcite it is instructive to consider this case in some detail before proceeding to an analysis of the full model in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",

    "this was to ensure that we were always in the basin of attraction of the non - fermi liquid fixed point and did not yet start _ flowing _ towards a fermi liquid one driven by the applied field .",
    "since we had to simultaneously capture scales that were many orders of magnitude apart ( @xmath433 vs @xmath35 ) the numerical calculations had to be done using `` quadruple precision '' arithmetics and the algorithms had to be designed carefully to assure the precision required .",
    "let us also point out that when fitting for instance @xmath467 for negative values of @xmath38 ( i.e. determining the temperature asymptotics of the _ flavor _ linear susceptibility as the system goes into the overscreened _ magnetic _ moment regime ) , the quantities involved become very small and the relative errors grow rapidly .",
