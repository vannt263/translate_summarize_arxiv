    "we report measurements of strange particle fragmentation functions in p+p @xmath4 collisions by the star experiment .",
    "these results provide additional tests to qcd inspired models of fragmentation such as pythia @xcite or the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) @xcite , beyond the usual comparisons to charged hadron fragmentation functions .",
    "furthermore , evidence for the modification of jet chemistry in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p , has recently been observed by the star experiment for au+au @xmath5 gev collisions via inclusive spectra measurements @xcite .",
    "these measurements showed the @xmath6 ratio from au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev / c is significantly higher than the respective value in p+p collisions .",
    "it is therefore essential we constrain theoretical descriptions of identified particle fragmentation functions , if the modifications in heavy - ion jet chemistry are to be further understood . finally ,",
    "since fragmentation functions characterise production from hard processes , comparisons to inclusive spectrum measurements may help elucidate the contributions from hard processes to those measurements as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the data presented are from @xmath9 8 million jet - patch triggered p+p @xmath5 gev events recorded in 2006 by the star experiment .",
    "the jet - patch trigger is designed to select events with jets , and thus requires energies above 8 gev to be deposited in an area @xmath10 within the electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is used to detect the charged particles , while the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter , bemc , is used for neutral particles .",
    "three jet finders are employed from the fast - jet package @xcite : @xmath11 , anti-@xmath11 and sis .",
    "we select recoil jets with respect to the triggered jets to measure fragmentation functions .",
    "this is because the triggered jets have a neutral energy bias .",
    "the jets are found within a resolution parameter , r @xmath12 and a jet axis @xmath13 cut @xmath14 to ensure the jet area lies within the tpc / bemc acceptance .",
    "the resolution parameter can be thought of as an effective jet radius in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the minimum @xmath8 cut for a charged particle is 200 mev / c , while the minimum calorimeter tower energy is 200 mev .",
    "towers which match charged particles are removed from the jet to avoid over counting of electrons and minimum ionising particles ( mips ) .",
    "no corrections are applied to the jet energy scale which means the reconstructed jet @xmath16 is likely to be less than the actual jet @xmath8 due to tpc / bemc detection inefficiencies , and missing neutral energy principally from undetected @xmath17 and @xmath18 particles .",
    "studies are underway to determine a correction for this .",
    "finally , in order to measure the fragmentation functions of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 particles , v0s are identified within the jet area from tpc tracks .",
    "the invariant mass distributions are calculated to extract the yields of these particles via their dominant decay channels : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in conjunction with a minimum @xmath16 cut of 1 gev / c ,",
    "a series of topological cuts are placed on the v0s to minimise the relative background contribution , and ensure the signal to background ratios are approximately the same for each particle .",
    "the residual background after all cuts is not yet removed from the fragment yields .",
    "strange particle fragmentation functions as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath16 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the fragmentation function is expressed in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the reconstructed jet and fragment @xmath8 respectively . for a particular particle species ,",
    "the integral of the @xmath28 function gives the mean number per jet over a chosen range in @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainties are statistical added in quadrature to the small differences obtained by comparing the three different jet finders .",
    "the measured v0 yields are not yet corrected for acceptance and tpc tracking inefficiencies .",
    "the pythia predictions are obtained by processing pythia events with star s detector simulation and reconstruction software .",
    "this ensures the pythia events are subject to the same acceptance restrictions / detector inefficiencies as the real data .",
    "the jet / v0 finding is then run on the simulated output in the same way as the real data .",
    "all pythia predictions shown in these proceedings are from version 6.4 with tune a. we find that pythia gives a reasonable description of the @xmath3 data .",
    "jetset ( the jet production scheme in pythia ) has also been shown to describe @xmath29 fragmentation functions in @xmath30 collisions well , where the jet energies range @xmath31 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pythia has been shown to describe charged hadron fragmentation functions in p+p collisions at the same center of mass energy @xcite . on the other hand , we note that the pythia description of @xmath1 and @xmath2 fragmentation functions are less satisfactory .",
    "although the predictions appear to predict the correct yield over all @xmath28 , they tend to over predict the yields at low @xmath28 and under predict the yields at intermediate @xmath28 .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    ", we show integrated @xmath32 and @xmath33 ratios for @xmath34 gev / c as a function of reconstructed jet @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis shows the @xmath32 ratio is below 1 showing the baryon asymmetry in the colliding system ( p+p ) is transferred to jets over all jet energies measured .",
    "we also find the @xmath32 ratio is consistent with the value obtained from inclusive spectra measurements @xcite .",
    "pythia also seems to reproduce the magnitude of the ratio .",
    "the jaggedness of the predictions is due statistical fluctuations which are not shown . regarding the @xmath33 ratios in jets , these are higher than values from inclusive spectrum measurements over all @xmath8 .",
    "the inclusive spectrum measurement will be dominated by production below 1 gev / c .",
    "when we compare the ratios in jets to the inclusive spectrum measurement above 1 gev / c , we find they are generally consistent .",
    "this may mean that @xmath19 and @xmath21 spectrum measurements with @xmath34 gev / c have a dominant contribution from hard processes i.e. jet production .",
    "we also find pythia again reproduces the magnitude of the ratio .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we show the peak position of the @xmath28 distribution , @xmath35 , for the various particles as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath8 .",
    "since the @xmath8 dependent tracking inefficiency / acceptennce will distort the shape of the @xmath28 distribution , we correct for both of these effects .",
    "a gaussian is fitted in the peak region to extract @xmath35 .",
    "the fit range is chosen to avoid the region in @xmath28 effected by the minimum @xmath16 cut on the fragments . in the mlla scheme ,",
    "the peak position can be described by the following relation @xcite ; @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant and @xmath38 is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the jet opening angle , and @xmath41 is the effective momentum where a parton ceases to branch in the parton shower .",
    "mlla predictions for fragmentation functions of hadrons with mass @xmath42 typically assume @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "equation [ equ : mlla1 ] then implies a scaling behaviour of @xmath35 with the mass of the hadron i.e. @xmath35 should decrease for the higher mass hadrons .",
    "the value of @xmath35 should also increase with jet energy for a given hadron which is observed in figure [ fig3 ] for all particles .",
    "however , we find the mass scaling appears only to work to first order since although @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "a similar observation was made for @xmath47 fragmentation functions for similar jet energies in @xmath30 collisions @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig4 ] we show the fragmentation functions of _ non - leading _ charged hadrons for the cases where the leading particle is a charged hadron , @xmath19 , or @xmath21 .",
    "we want to investigate whether tagging jets according to the species of the leading hadron , preferentially selects on gluon or quark jets .",
    "both measured data @xcite and theoretical predictions show hadron multiplicities are larger in gluon jets compared to quark jets : mlla gives the ratio 9/4 for gluon / quark jet multiplicities .",
    "thus , if tagging jets with particle a preferentially selected gluon jets , and tagging jets with particle b preferentially selected quark jets , we would expect the jets associated with particle a to have more non - leading charged hadrons compared to jets associated with particle b. however , in figure [ fig4 ] we observe at given jet energy , the charged hadron multiplicities are the same for each of the tagged jets .",
    "this might be expected for the highest jet @xmath16 bin where jet production is expected to be dominated by hard scattering of valance quarks , however at lower jet energies there should be mixture of quark and gluon jets @xcite .",
    "therefore , our observation suggests quark / gluon jets can not be tagged in this way .",
    "further studies are underway to confirm this .",
    "in summary , we have shown measurements of strange particle fragmentation functions . we have found that pythia describes the @xmath21 fragmentation functions well , however we observe some deviations for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 data .",
    "we have found that @xmath32 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets are consistent with values obtained from inclusive spectra .",
    "@xmath48 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets were found to be similar to values obtained from inclusive spectra in the same @xmath16 range .",
    "this may suggest that @xmath49 and @xmath21 production above 1 gev / c is dominated by hard processes in p+p @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "we investigated a mass scaling of the peak position of @xmath28 ( inferred from mlla ) , and found although @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we have found tagging jets with leading strange baryons / mesons may not preferentially select on quark / gluon jets .",
