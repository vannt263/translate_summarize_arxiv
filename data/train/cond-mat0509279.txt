    "in the pioneering experiments of chowdhury , ackerson and clark@xcite on laser induced freezing , a two - dimensional monolayer of colloidal particles in the liquid state was subjected to a laser intensity pattern periodically modulated along one direction .",
    "they found that if the wave - vector of the modulation is tuned to the wave - vector at which the liquid structure factor peaks , a triangular lattice with full two - dimensional symmetry results for laser intensities above a threshold value . in a later experiment wei _",
    "et al _ @xcite observed that this triangular lattice melts if the strength of the laser field is increased further .",
    "although such a ` reentrant melting ' phenomenon was observed in monte carlo studies @xcite of colloidal particles interacting via derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbook(dlvo)@xcite potential , later simulations of the same system by das _",
    "et al _ @xcite did not show the re - entrant phase .",
    "however , by extending the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young@xcite theory of defect - mediated melting in two dimensions to the case where an external periodic potential is present , frey _",
    "et al_@xcite argued that for short - range interactions there will indeed be a re - entrant transition to a liquid state .",
    "later experiments@xcite and simulations@xcite of charged colloids seem to confirm the occurrence of re - entrant melting",
    ". meanwhile , numerical studies@xcite of the effect of the external periodic potential on a system of hard disks have also shown the occurrence of re - entrant melting .",
    "all the above results correspond to the case when the commensurability ratio @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the mean particle distance and @xmath2 is the period of the external periodic potential ) has the value of 1 , i.e every potential trough is occupied by particles . in a recent experiment@xcite corresponding to @xmath3 , a new phase - the locked smectic state - was observed , with the crystalline state being found to melt via this new intermediate phase .",
    "this observation is also in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "no study has been reported as yet for the case where there is a possibility of incommensuration between the periodicity of the external laser field and some length - scale inherent to the two - dimensional colloidal system . in the present work we study",
    "just such a case .",
    "specifically , we look at the effect of the external laser field on a monolayer of colloidal particles , which interact via a short - range attraction apart from the usual hard - core repulsive interaction . such a short - range attraction is known to arise when hard sphere colloidal particles are mixed with polymers or smaller colloidal particles , giving rise to an effective attraction@xcite between the larger particles , called depletion interaction .",
    "it has also been suggested in the context of colloidal particles confined between two walls@xcite , where it is claimed that an attractive minimum in the effective interaction between a pair of colloidal particles arises when they are close to the walls@xcite .",
    "effects due to incommensuration should occur if the length - scale at which the attractive part of the interaction has its minimum is different from the periodicity of the externally applied laser field .",
    "novel phases can then appear in the system depending upon the relative strengths of the two competing potentials with different length scales .",
    "recently , g@xmath4tze _ et al _ @xcite studied the effect of an external potential with one - dimensional periodic modulation on the liquid - vapour transition line of a three - dimensional mixture of hard - sphere colloidal particles and polymers . in their density functional calculations",
    ", they obtained a new _ stacked fluid _",
    "phase , which consists of a periodic succession of liquid and vapour slabs .",
    "the presence of this new phase is a manifestation of the one - dimensional nature of the externally applied modulated potential in a three - dimensional fluid .",
    "their simulations and calculations also showed that the density profiles exhibit a non - monotonic crossover when the wavelength of the modulation matches the hard sphere diameter .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the effects of incommensuration on the phenomenon of freezing / melting of colloidal particles in two dimensions in the presence of a tunable `` substrate '' or external potential with one - dimensional periodic modulation . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider two different models that are described in section 2 , and use monte carlo simulations to study their behaviour . in our simulations of these two models",
    ", we clearly see that for both low and high values of the external potential the colloidal particles form crystalline structures , whereas for intermediate strengths of the external potential the system is in a modulated liquid phase .",
    "we term this phenomenon _ re - entrant freezing_. it is also observed that at high values of the external potential , different kinds of phases can occur depending on the length - scale at which the attractive part of the inter - particle potential has its minimum .",
    "our simulation results are described in detail in section 3 .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the generation of an effective attractive interaction between large hard - sphere colloid particles when they are mixed in a binary mixture with small hard - sphere colloid particles has been known for quite some time . in a recent study , casta@xmath5eda - priego _ et al _ @xcite calculated this depletion interaction in a strictly two - dimensional binary mixture of hard disks . using the expression of the depletion interaction derived in their work , we have constructed a model for a two - dimensional system of colloidal particles with short - range attractive interaction .",
    "the pair potential @xmath6 between particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 with centre - to - centre distance @xmath9 is given by : + @xmath10 } & { \\text{if $ \\sigma \\leq r_{ij } \\leq \\sigma(1+\\frac{1}{\\eta})$}}\\\\ 0   & { \\text{if $ r_{ij } > \\sigma(1+\\frac{1}{\\eta})$ } } \\end{cases } \\label{ueq}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath11 is the particle diameter and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two parameters which can be used to tune the depth and width of the short - range attractive part of @xmath6 .",
    "this interaction potential has a minimum at @xmath14 , i.e. when the two particles touch each other .",
    "the strength of the interaction potential at this minimum is given by @xmath15}\\ ] ]    in addition , we assume that a particle with co - ordinates @xmath16 experiences an external periodic potential of the form @xmath17 in the above equation , the constant @xmath18 is chosen such that for a number density of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the number of particles and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the lengths of the sides of a rectangular sample ) , the modulation is commensurate with a triangular lattice with nearest neighbour distance @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "thus , for the binary mixture we are trying to model , the wave - vector of the external potential is commensurate with the smallest reciprocal lattice vector ( @xmath25 ) of the triangular lattice that the large disks would form at that density in the absence of the smaller disks .",
    "also , the form of the external potential is such that its troughs run parallel to the @xmath26-axis .    for the system under study , the important parameters are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath13 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath32 the temperature .",
    "while the attractive part of @xmath6 would like to have the particles touching each other ( with inter - particle separation @xmath11 ) , the externally applied potential would like to have a density modulation in the @xmath33 direction with periodicity @xmath2 , resulting in the incommensuration .",
    "the second model we consider is one where the attractive potential is considered to be a gaussian well , with the position of its minimum being incommensurate with the inter - particle separation .",
    "thus , the pair potential @xmath6 between particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 with distance @xmath9 is given by @xmath34 } , \\label{dlvo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the radius of the colloidal particles with surface charge @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the inverse of the debye screening length .",
    "similarly to the first model , in this case also a colloidal particle with co - ordinates @xmath16 is assumed to experience an external periodic potential of the form @xmath17 as in the first model , the modulation of the external potential , @xmath2 is chosen such that for colloidal particles with density @xmath19 , the modulation is commensurate with a triangular lattice with nearest neighbour distance @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 . the parameter @xmath38 in eqn.[dlvo ] , which determines the position of the minimum of the attractive part of the potential , is assumed to be incommensurate with the triangular lattice .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 determines the depth of the attractive well and @xmath40 determines its width .",
    "this model was motivated in part by the suggestion@xcite that in a two - dimensional monolayer of charged colloidal particles in an aqueous solution confined between two walls , with the ` bare ' interaction between pairs of particles being given by the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbook(dlvo ) potential@xcite , an attractive well with a depth of the order of @xmath41 develops in the _ effective potential _ between a pair when the particles are near a charged wall .",
    "the depth and the position of the minimum are supposed to be strongly dependent on the distance from the wall , the effective charge on the colloid particles , the counter - ion density and the surface charge on the wall",
    ". however , this claim has been contested@xcite . in any case , leaving aside the question of a physical realization of the above model , its use tests the robustness of our results with respect to the details of the model interaction .",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations of a system of @xmath20 particles of diameter @xmath11 , interacting via the potential @xmath6 defined in eqn.[ueq ] . the particles are contained in a rectangular box of dimension @xmath42 , where ( @xmath43 ) , with periodic boundary condition being used for doing the monte carlo simulations .",
    "most results reported here are for simulations done for @xmath44 particles . in order to check finite size effects ,",
    "we will also discuss results for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    for a system of particles interacting via the potential specified in eqn.[ueq ] ,",
    "the phase diagram is not known even when the external laser field is absent .",
    "however , brownian dynamics simulations for a similar system@xcite suggest that at @xmath47 , there is a transition from a single , dispersed phase to a phase where the colloidal particles start forming clusters . in our present work",
    ", we consider the case @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the first parameter defines the depth of the attractive potential and the second one fixes its width ( @xmath50 ) . in the range of densities of our interest , @xmath51 , bolhuis _ et",
    "al _ @xcite have observed the co - existence of a high - density solid with a dilute gas for a two - dimensional system of particles interacting via a short - range attractive square potential .",
    "co - existing gas and solid phases are also found in three dimensions @xcite when the inter - particle attraction has a short range .",
    "our simulations also show the formation of clusters for the choice of @xmath52 and @xmath13 mentioned above . in fig.[fig1a ] , we have plotted the average density , representative of our simulated system , at @xmath53 .",
    "the plot clearly shows the co - existence of crystalline clusters with a gaseous phase , with particles arranged in a triangular lattice inside the clusters , as observed in the brownian dynamics simulations@xcite .",
    "the structure factor , @xmath54 , for a cluster , plotted in fig.[fig1b ] , shows peaks corresponding to a triangular lattice structure with spacing equal to @xmath11 , the hard sphere diameter .    our objective is to study how such a system of colloidal particles behaves in the presence of an external potential with one - dimensional periodic modulation @xmath2 which is not commensurate with the distance between the lattice planes of the triangular structure that the particles form in the absence of the field . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the average density @xmath55 and the structure factor @xmath54 for different strengths of the potential at a fixed particle density .    for @xmath53 ,",
    "when the strength of the potential is low , our simulations show that the system continues to form crystalline clusters with inter - particle separation @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and fig  [ fig3](a ) , we have plotted respectively the average density and the corresponding @xmath56 for the colloidal system when the strength of the laser - induced potential is @xmath57 . as can be seen from the plots , the nature of @xmath54 is similar to the case where the potential is absent .",
    "when the strength of the potential is increased to @xmath58 , the clusters break up and the particles try to align themselves along the potential troughs .",
    "the average density @xmath55 for this value of @xmath59 , plotted in fig.[fig2](b ) , shows that although there is a local triangular structure , the particles are also getting arranged in the @xmath33 direction , due to the influence of the external potential .",
    "the @xmath54 for this situation , plotted in fig.[fig3](b ) , shows that the height of the peaks corresponding to the triangular lattice has decreased considerably compared to that in fig.[fig3](a ) and new peaks have begun to appear on the @xmath60 axis with @xmath61 values corresponding to the wave - vector of the applied field .",
    "this clearly is an effect of the incommensuration .",
    "the system is in a ` frustrated ' state  the particles are making an attempt to lie at the troughs of the periodic potential , but the energy they gain by doing so is not sufficient to break the ` bonds ' of the triangular lattice with spacing @xmath11 .    in fig[fig2](c ) , we have plotted @xmath55 for the system when the strength of the laser field has been increased to @xmath62 .",
    "the crystalline clusters have now melted - the particles have become confined along the potential troughs .",
    "the @xmath54 for the system , plotted in fig[fig3](c ) , is characteristic of a modulated liquid , with the peaks of the structure factor located only at multiples of the characteristic wave - vector @xmath63 of the external periodic potential .    when the strength of the periodic potential is increased to higher values , the motion of the particles in the direction transverse to the potential troughs decreases considerably .",
    "the average density for the particles at a potential strength of @xmath64 , plotted in fig.[fig2](d ) , shows crystalline order corresponding to a square lattice , which is also reflected in the corresponding @xmath54 , shown in fig.[fig3](d ) .",
    "the peaks of the structure factor on the @xmath60 axis occur at wave vectors that correspond to multiples of the wave - vector of the external potential , whereas the peaks on the @xmath65 axis correspond to an inter - particle separation of @xmath11 inside each potential trough .",
    "we have also computed the spatial correlation function @xmath66 , which is the pair correlation function along the potential troughs , for the two phases observed for the potential strengths @xmath62 and @xmath64 . the maxima of the correlation function for @xmath62 , plotted in fig[fig4](a ) , decay quite fast , and at long distances @xmath67 .",
    "this is characteristic of liquid - like behaviour for the particles confined in the potential troughs .",
    "however , when @xmath64 , from the @xmath66 data plotted in fig[fig4](b ) , we can conclude that there is a periodic modulation of the density of the colloidal particle in the potential troughs , the period of this modulation being @xmath11 as expected .    to check whether the formation of the crystalline solid at the higher values of @xmath59 is a finite size effect ,",
    "we have calculated the corresponding order parameter @xmath68 for different system sizes , @xmath69 . for the solid phase ,",
    "the order parameters are the fourier components of the density @xmath70 calculated at the reciprocal lattice points @xmath71 . from the peaks of the structure factor",
    "plotted in fig.[fig3](d ) , we can get the four smallest reciprocal lattice vectors for the square lattice formed by the particles for @xmath64 .",
    "of these four vectors , the two lying on the @xmath60-axis correspond to the ordering due to the external field and the @xmath68 for these vectors are also non - zero for the modulated liquid .",
    "so the @xmath68 for the other two wave - vectors , denoted by @xmath72 , are the relevant order - parameters for checking the effects of the finiteness of the system .",
    "the average order parameter @xmath73 , has the values @xmath74 for @xmath75 respectively , implying weak dependence on the system size .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the square lattice formed at @xmath64 represents a crystalline phase .",
    "the appearance of this crystalline phase at a large value of @xmath59 can be understood from the fact that , for @xmath53 , the inter - trough spacing , which is governed by the periodicity of the external field @xmath2 , is approximately equal to @xmath11 , the distance at which @xmath6 has its minimum .",
    "in fact , for @xmath76 , the spacing @xmath2 is within the range of the attractive part of the potential , @xmath77 , for the value of @xmath13 used in our simulations .",
    "thus , at @xmath53 , if the transverse motion within a trough is suppressed , correlations develop across the troughs resulting in ordering of the particles in the @xmath78 direction , in addition to the ordering with spacing @xmath11 along the troughs .",
    "such a crystal structure corresponds to the lowest energy configuration consistent with the density and the inter - trough spacing .",
    "thus the system of colloidal particles , which had preferred to form crystalline clusters at low field strengths , regains a different crystalline phase at high field strengths , after passing through an intermediate modulated liquid phase .",
    "this phenomenon may be called _ re - entrant freezing_. it is interesting to note that the two crystalline phases have different symmetries , which is a consequence of the incommensuration effects .",
    "another aspect to note is that the solid is in co - existence with a dilute gas and the ` voids ' corresponding to the gaseous phase can occur at any point in space .",
    "this is a probable reason for the decrease in the height of the maxima of @xmath66 at large distances .",
    "the inter - trough correlations , observed at @xmath64 , are not developed at lower field strengths because the motion of the particles in the transverse direction is not suppressed sufficiently and the particles can vibrate within the width provided by the trough , thereby causing a destruction of the crystalline order .",
    "however , we should note that the kinetics of systems with hard - core interactions may depend strongly on the initial state@xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we observe such behaviour .",
    "for some initial configurations , the system gets kinetically jammed and due to this jamming , even at high field strengths , there is a co - existence of the square and triangular phases . in simulations",
    ", one can escape from jamming if a combination of local and non - local monte carlo moves are used .    for @xmath79 ,",
    "the wavelength of the external potential becomes smaller than the particle diameter and therefore , for these densities , the square lattice become unfeasible at high potential strengths .",
    "however , even for these densities , the particles in neighbouring troughs would like to be in contact with each other and that can only happen if they form a rhombic structure . in fig.[fig5 ]",
    ", we have plotted the average density for @xmath80 at @xmath64 .",
    "the particles have formed a ` mixed crystal ' , i.e they have formed domains which have local crystalline structure similar to the two structures shown in the figures below the @xmath55 plot . as @xmath81 , the motion of the particles becomes one - dimensional and the system tries to attain one of these two crystalline structures in order to minimize its free energy .      for the other choice of the pair potential given in eqn.[dlvo ] , we have considered @xmath82 particles in a rectangular box commensurate with a triangular lattice structure and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the screening length is fixed at @xmath83 where @xmath84 , the lattice spacing in a triangular arrangement , has been used as the unit of length in all the expressions . without any external field ,",
    "the system ( colloidal particles of diameter @xmath85 , surface charge @xmath86 and density @xmath87 , suspended in water having dielectric constant @xmath88 at a room temperature of @xmath89 ) is in the liquid phase .",
    "the parameters for the gaussian well are chosen as @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the first part of our simulations for this system ,",
    "the position of the attractive minimum is set at @xmath92 .    to observe the effect of the laser field in this system of particles ,",
    "the average density is calculated for different values of @xmath59 . in fig.[ch1 ] , we have shown a contour plot of the average density , representing a section of the simulation box , in the absence of the external potential . the average density does not show any order , signifying a liquid state .",
    "fig.[ch2 ] contrasts the effect the external potential has on the average density depending on whether the inter - particle potential has the attractive part or not . at @xmath93 ( subplots",
    "( a ) and ( b ) ) , the liquid - like structure of fig.[ch1 ] is replaced by one corresponding to a triangular lattice structure in both cases .",
    "the order parameter @xmath72 , corresponding to the triangular lattice structure , has the value @xmath94 for the pure dlvo potential and @xmath95 for the case when the attractive part is present . as the field",
    "is increased to @xmath96 , the crystalline order for the pure dlvo potential becomes much sharper , see fig.[ch2](c ) , and the value of @xmath72 ( for the triangular lattice ) becomes higher .",
    "but with the attractive part present ( see fig.[ch2](d ) ) , the average density looks like a set of liquid - like strings , indicating a modulated liquid phase , with @xmath72(for the triangular lattice ) becoming much smaller @xmath97 . at still higher fields , @xmath98 ,",
    "nothing changes qualitatively for the pure dlvo case ( see fig.[ch2](e ) ) .",
    "however , the average density plot for the case with the attractive potential ( fig.[ch2](f ) ) indicates the formation of a rectangular lattice .",
    "therefore , for this choice of inter - particle potential , we again find that the system of colloidal particles , which had formed a crystalline structure for low strength of the external potential , melts as the value of @xmath59 is increased .",
    "but at stronger external potential , the particles again form a crystalline structure which has rectangular symmetry , similar to what we had observed for the case of model-@xmath99 . hence , here also , we observe a re - entrant crystallization .    at high external potential strengths , different choices of the parameter @xmath38",
    "need not always result in a rectangular lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : lambda ] we have plotted the average density for various other values of @xmath38 and @xmath100 .",
    "it shows that a rich variety of phases can arise . to understand the structures , we consider the potential energy of a given particle in either triangular or rectangular lattice arrangement . since both the dlvo and the gaussian attractive part of the potential fall off rapidly with increasing particle separation , the contribution from the first shell of neighbours is the most significant .",
    "because of the large @xmath59 , the potential rises sharply in the @xmath101 direction from the potential troughs .",
    "thus we look for the potential experienced by a particle along the @xmath26 direction with the @xmath101 co - ordinate fixed to be at a minimum of the external potential . considering the six nearest neighbours for the triangular lattice case and the eight nearest and next - nearest neighbours for the rectangular lattice",
    ", we have calculated the effective potential well when all the neighbours are in perfect lattice positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : pot ] ) . for @xmath102 , the average density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : lambda](a ) ) looks like a modulated liquid with some superposed modulation perpendicular to the field direction also .",
    "[ fig : lim : pot](a ) shows the behaviour of the potential well for the same parameter values  both triangular and rectangular lattices are energetically _ unstable_. the energy minimum is for a hexagonal arrangement of the neighbours similar to that in triangular lattice , but the central particle has two equivalent energy minima displaced from the center .",
    "thus the system remains frustrated with some residual hexagonal order .",
    "as @xmath38 is tuned to a value of @xmath103 , a deep minimum in the single particle potential corresponding to a triangular lattice develops ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : pot](b ) ) .",
    "however , since we increased @xmath38 through a frustrated potential structure , the system takes a long time to relax to an unique triangular lattice spanning the whole system .",
    "[ fig : lim : lambda](c ) shows the average density plot for @xmath104 . to accommodate the history of the frustrated structure at lower @xmath38 , the shown part of the system goes through a coherent shift along the @xmath26 direction . at long times ,",
    "the average density shows sharp contours corresponding to a triangular lattice .    with increasing @xmath38 ,",
    "the single particle potential with the neighbours in a regular lattice structure again shows degenerate minima , but this time the rectangular lattice wins over the triangular lattice energetically . for @xmath105 the single particle potential",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : pot](c ) and the corresponding average density contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : lambda](e ) .",
    "the structure is that of modulated liquid , with superimposed rectangular modulation .    when @xmath106 , the rectangular structure is energetically stable and more favoured than the triangular lattice ( fig  [ fig : lim : pot](d ) ) . the average density plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lim : lambda](f ) ) shows sharp contours corresponding to a rectangular structure .",
    "therefore , once again , we observe that as a function of the location of the minimum of the attractive part of the inter - particle potential , the system switches from one kind of crystalline structure ( triangular ) to another ordered structure ( rectangular ) via a modulated liquid phase .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have investigated the effect of an external laser field , periodically modulated in one dimension , on a system of colloidal particles confined to two - dimensions and interacting via a potential that includes a short - range attraction component .",
    "the presence of this attractive interaction introduces a new length scale ( corresponding to the minimum of the attractive pair potential ) which can be incommensurate with the wavelength of the potential due to the externally applied laser field .",
    "we find that the competition between the two incommensurate length - scales results in the phenomenon of _ reentrant crystallization _ at high field strengths . in both the models we have studied , we find that the crystalline phase attained by the particles at low field strengths melts into a modulated liquid when the strength of the field is increased .",
    "however , it eventually crystallizes again , at higher field strengths , due to suppression of the particle motion in the direction of modulation of the applied potential .",
    "this phenomenon is opposite to the situation when the attractive interaction is absent , where one observes only re - entrant melting .",
    "we have also observed , at least in one of the models , that depending upon the position of the minimum of the attractive potential , one can get different phases when both the particle density and the laser potential are kept constant .",
    "we hope that our simulations will motivate experiments to observe the effect of the laser field in two - dimensional colloidal mixtures .",
    "also , in the context of colloidal aggregation , our simulations show that structures with square symmetry in the aggregated phase can be stabilized in the presence of substrates formed by laser intensity fringes .",
    "we have also shown that other novel structures can be formed by tuning various parameters of the colloidal system .",
    "further theoretical studies to understand the phenomena observed in our simulations in greater detail would be interesting to pursue .",
    "pc would like to thank serc ( iisc ) for providing the necessary computation facilities and jncasr for providing financial support .",

    "<S> the effects of an externally applied one - dimensional periodic potential on the freezing / melting behaviour of two - dimensional systems of colloidal particles with a short - range attractive interaction are studied using monte carlo simulations . in such systems , incommensuration results when the periodicity of the external potential does not match the length - scale at which the minimum of the attractive potential occurs . to study the effects of this incommensuration , we consider two different models for the system . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations for both these models show the phenomenon of reentrant freezing as the strength of the periodic potential is varied . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations also show that different exotic phases can form when the strength of the periodic potential is high , depending on the length - scale at which the minimum of the attractive pair - potential occurs . </S>"
