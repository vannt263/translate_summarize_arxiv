    "pion - nucleon scattering has traditionally been the premier reaction to study the resonance excitations of the nucleon . in particular ,",
    "in the @xmath3 partial wave , one finds two close - by resonances at 1535 and 1650  mev , which overlap within their widths of about 100  mev .",
    "it was pointed out early in the framework of unitarized coupled - channel chiral perturbation theory @xcite that this resonance might not be a three - quark ( pre - existing ) resonance but rather is generated by strong channel couplings , with a dominant @xmath4 component in its wave function .",
    "this analysis was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite , where within certain approximations the effects of 3-body @xmath5 channels were also included .",
    "further progress was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath3 phase shift was fitted from threshold to about @xmath6gev together with cross section data for @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the respective threshold regions .",
    "this led to a satisfactory description of the @xmath3 phase and a reasonable description of the inelasticity up to the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "two poles were found corresponding to the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 resonances together with a close - by unphysical pole on the first riemann sheet .",
    "more recently , it was pointed out in a state - of - the - art unitary meson - exchange model that there is indeed strong resonance interference between the two @xmath3 resonances , as each of these resonances provides an energy - dependent background in the region of the other @xcite .    in view of these developments and our attempts to construct a unitary and gauge - invariant model for goldstone - boson photoproduction off nucleons based on coupled - channel unitarized chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , we consider in this letter the two s - waves @xmath3 and @xmath10 in pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "we work in the framework of a coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) including in the driving potential all local terms of second order in the chiral counting , thus going beyond the often used approximation of simply including the leading order weinberg - tomozawa interaction .",
    "further , we do not perform the often used on - shell approximation .",
    "note that @xmath11 scattering including such dimension two terms was already analyzed in a framework equivalent to the on - shell approximation of the bethe - salpeter equation in refs .",
    "our investigation is restricted to center - of - mass energies below 1.8  gev , as required for the future meson photoproduction studies .",
    "as we will show , both resonances in the @xmath3 partial wave are dynamically generated , even if the scattering data are fitted only up to @xmath12gev .",
    "quite in contrast , the @xmath13 resonance is not generated by the coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "we also analyze the structure of the dynamically generated resonances as revealed through their coupling to the various meson - baryon channels .",
    "we consider the process of meson  baryon scattering at low energies .",
    "the s - wave interaction near the thresholds is dominated by the weinberg - tomozawa contact term , derived from the effective chiral lagrangian @xmath14_\\pm \\rangle ~ ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the trace in flavor space , @xmath16,b]$ ] , @xmath17 is the baryon octet mass in the chiral su(3 ) limit , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the axial coupling constants .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom are the goldstone bosons described by the traceless meson matrix @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the meson decay constant in the chiral limit , and the low - lying baryons are collected in a traceless matrix @xmath23 we set external currents to zero except for the scalar one , which is set equal to the quark mass matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "we furthermore use @xmath25 where the constant @xmath26 is related to the quark condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "the weinberg - tomozawa contact term mentioned above stems from the covariant derivative @xmath27 , and is of first order in the chiral power counting .",
    "most chiral unitary approaches restrict their meson - baryon potential to this interaction , which generates the leading contribution to the s - wave scattering lengths .",
    "this approach has been remarkably successful in many cases , see e.  g.  @xcite . however , at first chiral order , there are also the born graphs , describing the @xmath28-channel and @xmath29-channel exchanges of an intermediate nucleon .",
    "the full inclusion of these graphs in the driving term of the bethe - salpeter equation leads to conceptional and practical difficulties , which have not yet been solved to the best of our knowledge : ( i ) iteration of the @xmath28-channel exchange born graphs will generate various contributions leading to a renormalization of the various baryon masses ( and wave function renormalizations ) , which are usually set to their physical values in the loop functions of the chiral unitary approach .",
    "these contributions would thus have to be dropped . in view of a later application to photoproduction",
    ", such a non - perturbative treatment of @xmath28-channel exchanges leads to complications with gauge invariance because the self - energies are linked ( via a ward - takahashi identity ) to the electromagnetic baryon form factors , which would also have to be treated in a corresponding ( non - perturbative ) fashion .",
    "( ii ) iteration of the @xmath29-channel diagram , on the other hand , leads to all kinds of genuine multi - loop topologies , as there is no factorization into simple one - loop terms any more .",
    "the corresponding integral equation could only be solved numerically , e.g. by employing a wick rotation and a four - momentum cutoff .",
    "problems with gauge invariance would also occur here . in the literature ,",
    "the @xmath29-channel born diagrams were usually treated within some approximation which effectively reduced the solution of the bse to products of one - loop terms , or included perturbatively to guarantee a matching to chpt amplitudes up to a given order , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "all these approximations , however , destroy the exact correspondence of the individual terms in the solution of the bse to dimensionally regularized feynman graphs , which is crucial in our approach to photoproduction .",
    "therefore , we will approximate our interaction kernel by a sum of contact terms . to go beyond the simple weinberg - tomozawa potential",
    ", we shall include the full set of meson - baryon vertices from the second order chiral lagrangian .",
    "these terms may lead to sizeable corrections to the leading - order results , see e.  g. the calculation of nnlo corrections on meson - baryon scattering lengths within su(3 ) chpt  @xcite .",

    "moreover , it certainly fails in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "the purpose of the present work is the extension of the range of applicability of the low - energy effective theory by means of a coupled channel bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "introduced in  @xcite it has been proven to be very useful both in the purely mesonic and in the meson - baryon sector  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to perturbative calculations this approach implements two - body unitarity exactly and in principle allows to generate resonances dynamically .",
    "due to the exact correspondence of the bethe - salpeter scattering amplitude with an infinite sum of dimensionally regularized feynman graphs , we can use our solution of the bse as an extended vertex in a model amplitude for meson photoproduction and arrive at a natural and straightforward way to implement gauge invariance in a chiral unitary framework ( for details on the construction principles , see  @xcite ) .    in this section",
    "we collect the necessary formalism of the bethe - salpeter approach . we denote the in- and outgoing meson momenta by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively",
    ". moreover the overall four - momentum is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the momenta of in- and out - going baryon , respectively .",

    "so far we have suppressed the channel indices in the above formulas , however since we are dealing with coupled channels , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are matrices in channel space ( the propagators are represented by diagonal matrices ) . in view of a later application",
    "to photoproduction off protons , we restrict ourselves to meson - baryon channels with strangeness @xmath50 and electric charge @xmath51 .",
    "this leaves us with the following channels : @xmath52 now let us specify the interaction kernel to be iterated by means of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bse ] ) .",
    "as explained above , we only include the contact - term contributions from @xmath53 and @xmath54 and omit the born terms . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time these nlo corrections of the chiral potential are included and unitarized within the full relativistic bse , without making use of the on - shell approximation or s - wave projection of the chiral potential , so that also a p - wave is iterated .",

    "we have left out some terms which are formally of third chiral order .    the loop diagrams appearing in the bse eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bse ] ) are in general divergent and require renormalization . in case of a strict chiral perturbation expansion , the terms can be renormalized in a quite straightforward way , order by order , including at a given order of the calculation all the counterterms absorbing the loop divergencies . on the other hand the treatment of the divergencies of the bse",
    "is known to be a complicated issue , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "although the unitarization of the chiral potential provides us with large benefits regarding dynamically generated resonances , it relies on approximations of the kernel , which destroy some fundamental features of quantum field theory , such as crossing symmetry .",
    "there are various ways to treat the divergent integrals and the large baryon mass scale appearing . without going into details here , we preserve the analytic structure of the loop integrals by utilizing dimensional regularization and just replacing the divergent part by a subtraction constant .",
    "the purely baryonic integrals are set to zero from the beginning .",
    "thus , our treatment of the loop integrals is , in effect , similar to the eoms regularization scheme advocated in @xcite .",
    "as it was argued in @xcite it is not possible to express the terms necessary to absorb the divergencies in the bse as counterterms derived from a local lagrangian .",
    "however it is possible to alter the loop integrals in the solution of the bse in a way that is in principle equivalent to a proper modification of the chiral potential itself ( for an explicit demonstration , see app .",
    "f of @xcite ) . in this spirit",
    "we apply the usual @xmath61 subtraction scheme , keeping in mind that the modified loop integrals are still scale - dependent .",
    "this regularization scale ( @xmath62 ) dependence would be canceled by the corresponding scale dependence of higher - order contact terms in the perturbative approach , but in our nonperturbative framework , the scale @xmath62 is used as a fitting parameter , reflecting the influence of higher order terms not included in our potential . note that in @xcite , the 12 loop integrals ( 4 for each meson - baryon , meson and baryon case ) appearing there , gave rise to 12 finite subtraction constants , which were then also used as fitting parameters of their approach .",
    "having specified the kernel we are now ready to solve the bethe - salpeter equation . given the structure of the kernel , its iteration via",
    "the bse induces the following form of the scattering amplitude , @xmath63 where the coefficients t@xmath64 are @xmath65 matrices in channel space , which only depend on the center - of - mass energy @xmath66 after fixing the lecs , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath70 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 is a vector in the @xmath86-dimensional space of invariant structures .",
    "note that the scalar products are listed here as independent structures because we include the full off - shell dependence of the chiral potential in the bse , which prevents us from writing them as simple functions of the mandelstam variables @xmath28 and @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand the above decomposition allows us to pull the coefficients t@xmath64 out of the loop - integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bse ] ) . then these are fully determined by the solution of a linear system of equations in the space of invariant structures : @xmath88 where the v@xmath64 are coefficients of the chiral potential with respect to the invariant structures defined above and",
    "x is a @xmath89 matrix .",
    "the latter connects different structures of the space of invariant structures via loop integrations on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eqn : bse ] ) .",
    "once the bse has been solved , we can of course set the _ external _ four - momenta on their mass shells , leaving us with only two independent structures for the on - shell amplitude , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath90 .",
    "throughout the present work we use the following numerical values ( in gev ) for the masses and the meson decay constants : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the baryon mass in the chiral limit , @xmath17 in eq .",

    "there are 17 free parameters in the present approach , given by the 14 lecs , as well as three subtraction constants for the regularized loop integrals , corresponding to the logarithms of the undetermined regularization scales ( in gev ) , i.e.  @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . here",
    "we take the regularization scale of each channel to be fixed by the respective meson , i.e.  in addition to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we take @xmath109 . the latter constraint appears to be natural in view of our forthcoming work on meson photoproduction , where loops are present in which a photon - induced @xmath110 transition occurs .    for the fits ,",

    "the theoretically cleanest determination of these observables stems from the analysis of pionic hydrogen and pionic deuterium data based on effective field theory  @xcite , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the description of the @xmath129 amplitude at low energies will certainly be improved by a more complete treatment of the born terms , which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "one might also think about constraining the well - known pion - nucleon scattering lengths , e.g. by adopting a matching procedure to the perturbative expansion .",
    "however , since we did not put a special weight on the threshold region in our fits , and the overall description of the partial waves seems to work well over a rather broad energy range , we regard the obtained results for the scattering lengths as satisfactory .    moreover , and more importantly , within the fit region",
    "we reproduce the @xmath0 , without any use of explicit vector meson resonances or even taking into account the @xmath5 channels as for example in @xcite . at the same time",
    "the @xmath2 resonance is not reproduced by our approach , which is in agreement with the current state of knowledge that the first @xmath10 resonance does not have a prominent dynamically generated component . to emphasize this we exclude the data on @xmath10 and recalculate the @xmath130 for the above parameter set",
    ", we end up with @xmath131 .    at this point",
    "one realizes an even more interesting fact : after fixing the @xmath3 partial wave in the energy region up to @xmath132 gev every curve with minimized @xmath130 possesses a second structure between @xmath133 and @xmath134 threshold .",
