    "recent results on @xmath5 decay to charmonium modes , such as @xmath6 , are in good agreement with the standard model ( sm ) . however , for the time - dependent @xmath2 asymmetry in @xmath7 mode , also if new results seem to show more agreement with the sm , @xmath8 ( babar ) @xcite and @xmath9 ( belle ) @xcite , than in the past , ( before ichep04 , the world average @xmath10 @xcite ) , new physics ( np ) effects could still play some role . a deviation from the sm expectation of @xmath11 would call for large @xmath12 mixing , the existence of a new source of @xmath2 violation , and perhaps right - handed dynamics @xcite",
    ". it would be important to find confirming evidence in the future .",
    "in anticipation of a future  super b factory \" that would allow precision measurements , we study @xmath2 violation in the vector - vector @xmath13 mode by taking into account deviations in @xmath14 .",
    "we do not expect the np effects to show up in the branching fraction since , in contrast to @xmath15 , @xmath16 decay is tree dominant . with special attention to observables related to the time dependent @xmath2 asymmetry @xcite",
    ", we focus on manifestations of np effects . in the phenomenological analysis presented in this paper ,",
    "we pay particular attention to those obserables which are expected to vanish in the sm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 decay is dominated by the tree level @xmath19 process , while the @xmath2 phase in the corresponding penguin amplitude is highly suppressed .",
    "if np contributions are present , it could manifest itself as direct @xmath2 violation effects .",
    "this can be illustrated by the full amplitude for the decay @xmath20 , @xmath21 where the weak phases are assumed to be zero for the first amplitude and @xmath22 for the second , and @xmath23 are the respectively strong phases . for the @xmath2 conjugate decay @xmath24 the amplitude is given by changing the sign of the weak phase @xmath22 .",
    "one then obtains the direct @xmath2 asymmetry @xmath25 which does not vanish for @xmath26 and if the strong phase difference is also not zero .",
    "however , since the @xmath27 quark is rather heavy , the strong phases are expected to be small and the effect of np in the direct @xmath2 asymmetry could be washed out .",
    "it is therefore important that one can still seek for np effects by performing a time dependent analysis and comparing @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , more information is contained in the time dependent angular analysis of vector - vector decays such as @xmath30 or @xmath31 @xcite .    for a @xmath32 decay",
