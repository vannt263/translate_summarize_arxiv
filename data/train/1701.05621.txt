    "quest for supersolids ( `` coherent crystals '' ) in bose - einstein condensed systems is a subject with long history dating back to 1971 theoretical proposal by kirzhnits and nepomnyashchii @xcite .",
    "provided that the effective two - body interaction between the particles is designed in such a way , that it has sufficiently large negative fourier components in the vicinity of some finite momentum transfer @xmath0 , the ground state of the system can exhibit crystalline order .",
    "particular interest represent long - wavelenght structures , with unit cells containing macroscopically large amount of particles . despite numerous theoretical proposals @xcite , no convincing evidence of existence of such structures in nature has been reported .",
    "following significant advances in creation of ultracold polar molecules @xcite , a possibility of a supersolid with dipolar gases tightly confined to two dimensions ( 2d ) and having dipole moments oriented perpendicular to the plane of their translational motion has been theoretically considered @xcite .",
    "these studies were triggered by prediction of the helium - like roton - maxon instability @xcite and are now focused on the properties of possible quantum phases and transitions between them .",
    "a model of a stable supersolid of dipolar bosons has been proposed in the dilute limit at absolute zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 requirement is indispensable in reduced dimensionality to guarantee the extension of the phase coherence over multiple periods of the structure .",
    "thus conceived state of matter combines the crystalline order with the properties of a superfluid : it is commensurate , but its period can be tuned by varying the density or the velocity of the system .",
    "recently , quantum degenerate gases of dipolar excitons have been realized in semiconductor quantum wells@xcite .",
    "large binding energy of 2d excitons makes it possible to create dense and strongly - correlated ensembles@xcite , whereas the small effective mass raises the ultracold limit temperatures to the range of few degrees kelvin .",
    "powerful methods of semiconductor optical spectroscopy can be applied to excitonic gases in order to study their properties@xcite .",
    "for instance , photoluminescense ( pl ) measurements provide access to the exciton density@xcite , spin@xcite and energy distribution@xcite .",
    "shift - interferometry of the exciton pl offers a unique possibility for systematic investigation of coherence properties of a gas without perturbing its ( quasi-)equilibrium configuration ( this is in contrast with time - of - flight @xcite , bragg spectroscopy @xcite and `` momentum focusing '' @xcite techniques employed for atomic systems ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing features observed in the experiments on ultracold excitons is the macroscopically ordered exciton state ( moes ) @xcite .",
    "below some temperature ( up to 4 k ) the external ring in the pl pattern of indirect excitons fragments into a chain of regularly spaced aggregates ( `` beads '' ) having macroscopic sizes .",
    "local exciton energy follows the density distribution , so that the aggregates are characterized by strong repulsive interaction @xcite .",
    "the periodical density modulation is accompanied by a buildup of the off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) at the edges of each bead .",
    "the coherence of the pl collected from the cores of the beads remains partially suppressed even at the lowest temperatures achieved in the experiment .",
    "the coherence length at the edges is comparable with the size of one bead and much less than the circumference of the ring@xcite . along with the emergence of extended coherence and spatial periodicity , the specific heat of the exciton gas exhibits dicontinuity @xcite .",
    "the corresponding critical point @xmath2 is remarkably robust to disorder : independent segments of the ring isolated by defects ( current filaments ) and having strongly different lengths and widths fragment at the same temperature . finally , we note that not all of the intended studies led to observation of the phenomenon . thus ,",
    "for example , the ring does not fragment in the samples used by pittsburgh @xcite and bell labs @xcite groups .",
    "several theoretical models were proposed to descirbe the moes @xcite .",
    "an explanation of the aforementioned experimental facts starting from a single principle was given in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanism underlying the phenomenon as proposed in this latter model is reminiscent of the roton instability in dipolar superfluids .",
    "it is clear , however , that the moes can not be regarded as a conventional supersolid at least because it has a very different coherence regime .",
    "an attempt to put the physics of the exciton density wave in the context of supersolidity in dipolar gases is the subject of this paper .",
    "our main conclusion is that the moes may be described as a _ fragmented supersolid _ : a supersolid where the global coherence is destroyed by the quantum fluctuations of the relative phases between the adjacent lattice sites .",
    "this picture proves to be consistent not only with the earlier experimental results mentioned above , but is further supported by the recently observed commensurability of the moes and dependence of its wavelength on the exciton density@xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present our theory . we introduce a minimal model describing a quasi - one - dimensional gas of dipolar excitons ( which corresponds to a segment of the ring in the experiments )",
    ". we also point out a possible realization of such model with ultra cold polar molecules . by using a mean field approach",
    "we discuss emergence of supersolidity in the system for two different regimes : a one - dimensional mean field and a 2d thomas - fermi cigar .",
    "we suggest that a stable dipolar supersolid can be described as a chain of self - trapped bose - einstein condensates . for sufficiently strong repulsive interaction between the particles the chain undergoes a quantum phase transition to a number - squeezed fragmented configuration , akin to the fragmented bec in an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "we estimate the critical value of the relevant parameter and obtain an expression for the wavelength @xmath3 of the fragmented supersolid .",
    "all results of the theory have transparent analytical form .    in sec .",
    "iii we compare our results with the experiments .",
    "previously , we have already demonstrated consistency of our formula for the moes wavelength in the regime where the ring is allowed to expand when changing the laser excitation power ( fixed gate voltage)@xcite .",
    "here we use the same equation to fit the recently observed dependence of @xmath3 on the gate voltage in the regime where the ring radius is maintained fixed . in this latter case",
    "@xmath3 was found to increase when increasing the exciton density ( the gate voltage)@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to what would be expected for conventional supersolids .",
    "our formula captures this experimental result as well .",
    "we conclude sec .",
    "iii by explaining the observed commensurability of the exciton density wave .    in sec .",
    "iv we list main results and conclusions .",
    "being an effective field theory , our spinless model can be obtained from more realistic multi - component systems by tracing out the corresponding degree of freedom . in some cases ,",
    "this may offer one a possibility to independently tune the short- and long - range parts of the effective interaction .",
    "we point out important examples of such systems in excitons and polar molecules .",
    "the underlying principle is a 2d analogy of the feshbach resonance in atomic gases@xcite , and it should allow one to test the predictions of the theory in a controllable fashion .",
    "we consider a spinless gas of purely 2d bosonic particles having dipole moments oriented perpendicularly to the plane of their center - of - mass translational motion ( @xmath4 plane ) . in order to model a segment of the ring",
    "we introduce harmonic confinement in one direction ( @xmath5 axis ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the particle mass and @xmath9 is the confinement oscillator frequency . for our purposes it will be convenient to recast the particle field operator in the form @xmath10 and to expand its second - quantized part @xmath11 in terms of the plane waves @xmath12 with @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 is the length of the segment . at distances much larger than the transverse size of the system the two - body interaction potential @xmath16 behaves as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the characteristic dipole - dipole distance .",
    "in what follows we shall assume @xmath19 .    at zero temperature",
    "one can expect a range of parameters ( to be specified below ) in which the system can be described by the uniform ( along @xmath20 ) order parameter @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the 1d density . in the lowest - order approximation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25 value of the momentum - dependent pseudopotential@xcite , and the function @xmath26 can be found by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath29 is defined by the normalization condition @xmath30 the dimensionless form allows one to identify two important regimes of the mean field approximation .",
    "the first one , hereafter called the _",
    "1d mean field _",
    ", corresponds to the range of densities where @xmath31 and interactions are weak ( @xmath32 ) . in this case",
    "the solution of approaches the gaussian ground state of the transverse harmonic trap .",
    "the chemical potential is given by @xmath33 where we have introduced the 1d coupling constant @xmath34 in the opposite limit , where @xmath35 one enters the transverse thomas - fermi regime , which we shall refer to as _ the 2d cigar_. in this regime the system locally retains its 2d origin .",
    "by imposing the normalization condition on @xmath36 one obtains @xmath37 the thomas - fermi half - width of the cigar is defined in the usual way as a classical turning point and it reads @xmath38 the structure of eq . implies that the thermodynamic limit for such quasi-1d system can be achieved by letting simultaneously @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , while keeping fixed the combination @xmath42 .",
    "according to the width of the cigar in this limit becomes increasingly large . throughout the paper , however , we shall always assume @xmath43 , so that the system looks one - dimensional from the geometrical point of view .    for strong interactions ( @xmath44 )",
    "the gross - pitaevskii picture discussed above becomes inadequate . in this case",
    "one can distinguish between a tonks - girardeau gas of impenetrable bosons@xcite ( dilute limit , @xmath45 ) and a dense strongly correlated quasi-1d superfluid ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the latter scenario is of particular interest as it is relevant to the experiments on moes .",
    "the low energy properties of the system in this regime can be described by using the hydrodynamic theory of superfluids . assuming a linear dependence of the local chemical potential on the 2d density , one recovers the results obtained in the thomas - fermi approximation , with the only difference being the value of the coupling constant @xmath24 .      .",

    "the spectrum starts to develop a roton - maxon structure ( solid thick line ) .",

    "for the 1d density @xmath49 larger than @xmath63^{-1}$ ] the spectrum develops a roton - maxon structure . at the point @xmath64^{-1}\\ ] ] the roton minimum touches zero and the uniform condensate becomes dynamically unstable .",
    "one would expect that at this point the system exhibits a second order quantum phase transition@xcite to a stripe state @xmath65 with @xmath66 being an increasing function of the density ( the corresponding equation can be obtained from by putting @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 corresponding to the position of the roton minimum .",
    "however , in the frame of the model the inverse compressibility @xmath69 of the state is negative , which implies a collapse .       of a quasi - one - dimensional condensate of bosonic dipoles as a function of the density @xmath70 .",
    "the uniform state ( u ) ceases to be the ground state at @xmath71 . at this point",
    "the system undergoes a first order quantum phase transition to a supersolid state ( s ) via a collapse ( shaded area ) accompanied by an increase of the instability magnitude @xmath72 and wavevector @xmath73 . for small @xmath72 the corresponding dependence @xmath74 is given by with the substitution and",
    "is shown by the red line .",
    "as @xmath73 approaches @xmath75 , three - body repulsive forces become more efficient and , eventually , stabilize the system in a supersolid phase ( s ) .",

    "iv ) one should take @xmath82 , which corresponds to 6 possible ways of composing an interaction of an exciton and an excitonic pair ( quasi - biexciton ) in the system of equally populated spin - up and spin - down branches ( a binary mixture ) .    following the approach developed for the 2d atomic dipoles",
    "@xcite , we substitute the _ ansatz _ into the many - body hamiltonian supplemented with the term to obtain the energy density of the system @xmath89 where    @xmath90    and @xmath91 . minimization of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath93 yields @xmath94 for @xmath95 this gives the above result , and for @xmath96 one finds @xmath97 in agreement with the expression for the wavevector of a crystalline fluctuation of the exciton order parameter close to the critical temperature @xcite .    substituting into the energy functional , expanding the result up to the fourth power of @xmath72 and further minimizing it with respect to @xmath72 one obtains @xmath98 where the condition @xmath99 should be satisfied .",
    "the latter can be regarded either as a condition for the critical density @xmath100 [ for @xmath101 one recovers the result ] or for the critical value of the contact interaction@xcite at which the transition to a supersolid state is expected to take place .",
    "this transition is not , however , of the second ( continuous ) type , as one would expect on the general grounds@xcite . indeed , as one can see in fig .",

    "for large @xmath73 the equation yields @xmath114 consistently with the analogous result for the 2d system @xcite .",
    "in the same limit the equation for the energy density takes the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 one can see , that for sufficiently small @xmath117 the compressibility @xmath118 of the density wave becomes positive , which means stabilization of the system .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath117 is defined by the requirement for the supersolid energy to be lower than the energy of the uniform state ( u ) .",

    "the chemical potential is large , and the system is in the molecular phase , characterized by strong repulsive interaction between the dipolar molecules .",
    "an intriguing prediction of our theory is that it may be possible to observe an abrupt extension of the coherence length over multiple periods of the moes by reducing the exciton density and going to extremely low temperatures ( below 0.1 k , see the discussion in the end of subsection b , theory ) .",
    "as the system becomes more dilute , the fraction of the molecular superfluid in a bead decreases and contribution of the unpaired excitonic component to the average interaction becomes more important . as a result , one may expect to reduce the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath247 down to the critical value .",
    "however , the bath temperature @xmath326 must be sufficiently low ( on the order of @xmath29 ) in order to suppress the long - wave fluctuations of the phase - otherwise , one would merely destroy the crystal.@xcite    in conclusion , we have argued that the moes may be a form of the supersolid state of matter .",

    "one may expect that , under appropriate conditions , this bound state can become a resonance .",
    "it is important to stress , that the effective reduction of @xmath24 , the predicted roton instability and the transition to a supersolid phase here should be searched on the attractive side of the resonance and not in the vicinity of a weakly - bound state . in the latter case",
    "the contact interaction vanishes only in the channel where the two molecules belong to different layers , whereas it remains finite ( repulsive ) for the intralayer scattering .",

    "the value of the contact interaction parameter @xmath247 here should be taken in the critical region @xmath327 , and it is expected to be vanishingly small ( see discussion in the main text ) .      an alternative way to suppress the long wave fluctuations of the phase is to reduce the longitudinal size of the system . in this regard ,",
