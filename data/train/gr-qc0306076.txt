    "clock synchronization algorithms play a key role in applications such as communication , message encryption , and navigation . recently , there have been a number of proposed clock synchronization algorithms based on a quantum information approach chuang2000,jozsa2000,preskill2000,giovannetti2001,shihprl2003,burt2001,jozsa2000a , yurtsever2000 .",
    "these discussions have been based mostly on non - relativistic quantum mechanics . in many applications ,",
    "however , clock synchronization must be performed between two nodes that are in relative motion , such as a jet aircraft and the ground , or between two nodes that are at different gravitational potentials , such as a satellite and the ground , or even two satellites at different altitudes . in such cases ,",
    "a correct treatment of quantum clock synchronization must include relativistic effects from the start .",
    "the well - known tension between quantum mechanics and relativity theory makes this a difficult task .",
    "it is clear that the concepts of measurement , and transformation of measurable quantities under lorentz transformations , play a key role in the problem of clock synchronization for both quantum and classical schemes .",
    "however , the transformation of measurable quantities has not been discussed even for the case of classical clock synchronization .  in this article , we analyze in some detail the relativity of clock synchronization in the global positioning system ( gps ) , which is based on a classical synchronization scheme .",
    "in particular , we describe the transformation properties of the measured quantity called pseudorange in the gps @xcite .",
    "we hope that clarifying the transformation properties of measurable quantities in classical clock synchronization will provide some useful insight into the problem of quantum clock synchronization .",
    "the global positioning system ( gps ) is a u.s .",
    "military constellation of satellites used for time keeping , and for navigation of land , air and sea  @xcite .",
    "recently , two papers have analyzed the system of space - time coordinates that is used in the gps  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we address a different but related aspect : the transformation of gps pseudorange measurements .",
    "a remarkable aspect of the gps is that a receiver need not be stationary with respect to the earth s surface to obtain accurate time and position . a ship , a jet aircraft , or a low - earth - orbit satellite can each compute accurate time and position , even though they have different velocities",
    "this feature of the gps is a consequence of two aspects : the signal structure of the satellite broadcasts and the special type of measurement that a gps receiver makes .",
    "the gps satellite signals set up an invariant grid of 3-dimensional space - time hypersurfaces ( light - cones ) .",
    "each hypersurface is uniquely marked by the satellite that generated the hypersurface and by the space - time coordinates of  the event of generation of the light - cone @xcite . by measuring the pseudorange to four satellites",
    ", the gps receiver essentially determines its position by identifying the four hypersurfaces that it intersects .",
    "the pseudorange measurement is independent of receiver motion , up to an additive constant .",
    "for this reason , the measured pseudorange may be called a lorentz pseudo - invariant .",
    "below , we will see that the pseudorange is actually a two - point scalar under generalized coordinate transformations .",
    "the transformation properties of the pseudorange is a key element of the gps , yet this subject has only briefly been mentioned in the literature  krallbahder2001 .    in order to present a coherent description of the transformation properties of the pseudorange , we must deal with the nature of the broadcast gps signals , the relativistic effects that impact these signals , as well as the measurement process itself .",
    "therefore , the outline of this article is as follows .  in section",
    "ii , we present a two - receiver thought experiment to clarify the concept of invariance of pseudorange measurements .",
    "section iii contains a description of the space - time metric  in the vicinity of the earth .",
    "section iv describes the relativistic effects on the gps  satellite clocks and on the observed signals , using the metric in section iii .",
    "section v discusses the nature of the gps broadcast signals , which are used to set up the space - time grid .",
    "section vi discusses the pseudorange measurement process , using a mechanical analogue for a gps  receiver .",
    "the transformation properties of the pseudorange are obtained in section vi .",
    "section vii contains a brief discussion of navigation and time transfer using gps signals .",
    "a correction is derived to the conventional flat space - time model of pseudorange .",
    "section ix  contains a summary and comments .",
    "in order to make clear the concept of transformation of pseudorange measurements we offer a simple thought experiment . consider two identical gps receivers that are in relative motion .",
    "for example , one receiver is stationary with respect to the earth s surface and the other is on a jet aircraft travelling at 1000 km / hour .",
    "each gps receiver carries an identical copy of the software that is used to compute receiver position and time .",
    "assume that each receiver is tracking the same four gps satellites .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ tworeceiverexperiment ] .",
    "assume the two receivers world lines cross at an event @xmath0 in space - time .",
    "does each receiver compute the same spatial position and time for the coincident event @xmath0 ? from a physics stand point ,",
    "the gps satellites orbit the earth at approximately 8.37 km / s , and there are large doppler frequency shifts due to satellite and receiver motion  relativisticeffects . in the gps ,",
    "the actual computation of receiver position and time depends on the space - time coordinates of the signal emission event ( at the satellite ) , @xmath1 , and reception event ( at the receiver ) , @xmath2 . in an earth - centered inertial ( eci ) frame ,",
    "these coordinates are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , however in the receiver s comoving frame the emission and reception events have different coordinates , say @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the two sets of coordinates , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 are related by a lorentz transformation , which depends on receiver velocity with respect to the eci frame .",
    "the actual electromagnetic field is different in each receiver s comoving frame , so there is different input information into each identical measuring device ( receiver computer program ) . how can the two receivers compute the same spatial position and time from different input information ?",
    "the key concepts are the space - time grid that is created by gps satellites and the transformation properties of the measurable quantity in the gps , which is called the pseudorange .",
    "these two themes are developed in the following sections .",
    "the world lines of two receivers , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are shown .",
