    "one of the most important motivation to study general relativity in lower dimensions , in particular @xmath0-dimension , is to understand and explore physics in a rather simpler context . among the others ,",
    "the well known @xmath0-dimensional study in the literature is the solution obtained by baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite , which describes black hole solution with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the general properties of the @xmath0-dimensional gravity , particularly the btz solution was considered in detail by carlip in @xcite . in this seminal paper ,",
    "carlip addressed also the possible relations to quantum gravity via the `` microscopic '' physics of quantum gravitational states .",
    "no doubt that , this work has unveiled the underlying rich structure in @xmath0-dimensional gravity and has motivated many researchers to work along this line .    in the last two decades , @xmath0-dimensional gravity sourced by different matter fields has attracted considerable interest .",
    "einstein - maxwell extension has been considered both in linear @xcite and nonlinear 4,5,6 electrodynamics .",
    "einstein - scalar and einstein - maxwell - scalar extensions are considered in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "scalar field extension in the form of multiplets is also considered in @xcite . in these studies",
    ", the solutions admitting black holes are investigated in details in terms of thermodynamic properties .",
    "however , solutions admitting naked singularities are studied rarely .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the classical and the quantum properties of the recently obtained solution that incorporates with a self - interacting real scalar field @xcite .",
    "this solution is a one parameter generalization of the solution obtained by schmidt and singleton ( ss ) in @xcite .",
    "the ss solution does not have a horizon and the curvature singularity at @xmath1 is a typical naked singularity .",
    "another notable feature of the ss solution is that the spatial part of the metric is flat , whereas the temporal part is equivalent to the asymptotic form of ads spacetime .",
    "in contrast to the ss solution , the recently found metric in @xcite , can possesses black hole or naked singularity depending on the parameters .",
    "furthermore , the spatial part of the metric given in @xcite is not flat .",
    "hence , the inclusion of a parameter in the new solution has a drastic effect on the topology of the resulting spacetime .    in this paper ; first as a classical analysis , the physical properties of the spacetime geometry of a self - gravitating real scalar field admitting black hole solution will be investigated by considering the geodesics equations .",
    "the null and timelike geodesics are obtained exactly by integrating the geodesic equations .    secondly ; as a quantum analysis , the occurrence of naked singularity that the solution given in @xcite admits will be investigated .",
    "solutions admitting naked singularities are always undervalued .",
    "hence , our knowledge about their structure / nature is limited .",
    "this limited information is in fact natural , because the scale where this singularity forms is smaller than the planck scale . in this microscopic regime",
    ", one would not expect from the classical methods to provide reliable insight .",
    "the general belief in these regimes where the curvature of the spacetime becomes enormous is that to adopt the laws of quantum gravity .",
    "consequently , the appropriate method for analyzing the singularities must be found within the framework of quantum theory of gravity .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consistent quantum theory of gravity to be used in singularity analysis yet . in the light of this fact , any method that incorporates with quantum fields / particles for the resolution or persistence of curvature singularities",
    "would be considered as a step in the right direction . in the literature , there are alternative methods for this purpose .",
    "loop quantum gravity @xcite and string theory @xcite are the two important fields in the resolution of singularities . in this paper ,",
    "an alternative method will be used , so that the motion of quantum fields / particles will be considered in a classical background . in the analysis of the naked singularity , @xmath2 @xmath3",
    "( scalar ) and @xmath2 @xmath4 ( fermionic ) wave packets obeying the klein - gordon and dirac equations will be used in probing the singularity . instead of a point particle probe which leads to the notion of _ geodesics incompleteness",
    "_ , the quantum particle probe will be used which leads to the notion of _ quantum singularity_.    organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the new einstein - scalar solution in @xmath5dimensions .",
    "geodesics of a classical particle in the metric admitting black hole is considered in section iii .",
    "quantum probes of spin@xmath6 and spin@xmath7 are considered for the timelike naked singular version of the solution in section iv .",
    "the paper is completed with conclusion and discussion in section v.",
    "recently , a new exact radial solution with a self - interacting real scalar field in @xmath0-dimensional gravity has been introduced in @xcite . this new solution in fact constitutes a one - parameter generalization of the solution obtained by schmidt and singleton ( ss ) in @xcite .",
    "the striking property of the solution presented in @xcite is that the spatial part of the metric was flat .",
    "however , in the new solution @xcite , the spatial part is not flat , i.e. the metric tensor component @xmath8 . in comparison with the solution given by ss",
    ", the new solution has a richer structure .",
    "one of the distinctive richness is the existence of black holes .",
    "the action and the line element ansatz in einstein - scalar theory in @xmath0-dimensions are given by @xmath9@xmath10respectively in which @xmath11and @xmath12furthermore in @xcite it was shown that the solution of the field equations gives @xmath13and @xmath14 in these solutions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two real parameters and @xmath17 is an integration constant .    finally , the line element in terms of the parameters can be written as@xmath18which is in general highly dependent on the three parameters @xmath19 @xmath17 and @xmath20 depending on the choice of these parameters , the general solution admits black holes or naked singularities .",
    "for instance , the black hole solution is possible if one sets @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 where a quasilocal mass evaluated from the brown - york @xcite formalism is given by@xmath24note that if we take @xmath21 we obtain the following line element@xmath25after redefining the radial coordinate as @xmath26 the metric ( 9 ) becomes@xmath27before going further let us justify our choice of @xmath28 by the fact that @xmath29 and @xmath30 at @xmath31 which provides the maximum effect for this specific @xmath32 the resulting metric given in equation ( 10 ) , can be interpreted as a one - parameter generalization ( namely , with @xmath17 ) of the solution obtained by ss .",
    "one can easily recover the solution in ss , if @xmath33 @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the resulting metric ( 10 ) admits naked singularities if @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath22 , @xmath37 one of the scope of this paper is to investigate the nature of this naked singularity in view of quantum mechanics .",
    "as we mentioned in previous section , the general solution for @xmath38 admits black hole with a general line element given by @xcite@xmath39 in which @xmath40with @xmath41herein @xmath42 guarantees that in the limit @xmath43 we get the corresponding btz solution with the proper mass @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , in terms of the parameter used in previous section one finds@xmath44and@xmath45provided both @xmath17 and @xmath16 are negative .",
    "the lagrangian of a classical test particle with unit mass is given by@xmath46 in which a dot stands for the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath47 the normalization condition , in other hands , imposes @xmath48 or@xmath49 in which @xmath50 is the four - velocity and @xmath51 for null , timelike / spacelike geodesics .",
    "the euler lagrange equation can be found by introducing@xmath52and@xmath53 in which @xmath54 is the energy of the particle and @xmath55 the angular momentum . inserting ( 19 ) and ( 18 ) into ( 17 ) , we find the following@xmath56a combination of ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) admits @xmath57      setting @xmath58 in ( 21 ) one finds@xmath59 in which @xmath60 considering ( 12 ) the latter equation reads@xmath61to proceed further we set @xmath62 resulting in @xmath63which upon introducing the new variables @xmath64 and @xmath65 this yields@xmath66this admits a solution given by@xmath67 in which @xmath68 is an integration constant .",
    "finally we add that the inverse transformation of the variables yield a complete solution expressed by@xmath69where @xmath70 provided @xmath71    in null geodesics when @xmath58 the coordinate time @xmath72 equation of the position @xmath73 is given by the combination of eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 18 ) .",
    "hence , one obtains@xmath74where for @xmath62 and @xmath75 given by ( 12 ) we find@xmath76which upon a change of variable of the form @xmath77 becomes@xmath78this equation admits an exact solution given by@xmath79 in which @xmath80 as @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath82 i.e. , @xmath83 , so is @xmath84 which imply that @xmath85 at exactly @xmath86 the solution is obtained to be@xmath87 in which @xmath88 and @xmath89 note that the negative branch corresponds to @xmath90 and vice versa . from the latter equation we comment that in the negative branch solution the null particle escapes from the black hole and in an infinite time interval it reaches to infinity . in contrary , the positive branch solution approaches to the horizon in an infinite time interval .",
    "these are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "versus @xmath91 for positive ( red - dash ) and negative ( blue - solid ) branch solutions corresponding to the negative and positive initial velocity respectively and @xmath86 .",
    ", width=453 ]      in circular motion we have @xmath92 and is constant .",
    "this together with ( 24 ) we find@xmath93this equation admits a solution for @xmath94 given by@xmath95which for @xmath96 the solution is positive and larger than the radius of event horizon .",
    "therefore for null particle with given @xmath97 there exist only one single possible circular orbit whose radius is obtained as ( 35 ) .",
    "looking at the master radial equation for the null particle with affine parameter @xmath98 @xmath99and rewriting it as@xmath100one can find @xmath101which is clearly negative at @xmath102 indicating that the circular motion is unstable .      for the radial motion of a null particle we set @xmath103 in ( 29 ) which yields@xmath104whose exact solution",
    "is given by@xmath105 in which @xmath106 in the case of outward initial velocity the radial position of the null particle increases as fast as the exponential of time and for the inward initial velocity it approaches asymptotically to the horizon .",
    "spacetime singularities constitutes one of the important predictions of the einstein s theory of relativity .",
    "it describes the location in the fabric of spacetime in which the physical quantities like tidal forces , gravitational fields and energy densities becomes unbounded . or , in other words , it is defined as the `` end point '' for the time evolution of the timelike and null geodesics .  according to the penrose s weak cosmic censorship hypothesis ,",
    "singularities must be covered by horizon(s ) , for the deterministic nature of the theory of general relativity . however , there are some situations such that the solutions to the einstein s equations admit singularities that are not hidden by horizon(s ) and becomes visible to the asymptotic observers",
    ". singularities in this kind are called naked singularities and violates the cosmic censorship hypothesis of penrose .",
    "a question has been asked : how could this singularity problem in general relativity be resolved ? .",
    "so far , it seems that the most promising method for the resolution of the singularities is the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the reason for this is the scales where these singularities are developed , and hence , classical general relativity is expected to be replaced by quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however , a complete quantum theory of gravity is not available yet .",
    "for this reason , an alternative method which was developed by horowitz and marolf ( hm ) 15 following the work of wald @xcite will be used in this paper . in order to probe the naked singularity , quantum particles with @xmath107 ( scalar ) and @xmath108 ( fermion )",
    "comply with klein - gordon and dirac equations will be used , respectively .",
    "the main theme of the hm criterion which can be applied only to static spacetimes having timelike naked singularities is summarized as follows : the crucial idea is to split the spatial and time part of the klein - gordon equation and write it in the form of@xmath109where @xmath110 is the spatial wave operator .",
    "note that , this operator is a symmetric and positive on the hilbert space @xmath111 according to the hm , the singular character of the spacetime with respect to quantum probe is characterized by investigating whether the spatial part of the operator @xmath110 has a unique self - adjoint extension ( i.e. essentially self - adjoint ) in the entire space or not .",
    "if the extension is unique , it is said that the space is quantum mechanically regular . in order to clarify this point , consider the klein - gordon equation for a free particle that satisfies@xmath112whose solution is@xmath113 in which @xmath114 denotes the extension of the operator @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath110 has not a unique self - adjoint extension , then the future time evolution of the wave function ( 42 ) is ambiguous and hm criterion defines the spacetime as quantum mechanically singular .",
    "the essential self - adjointness of the operator @xmath110 , can be verified by considering solutions of the equation@xmath115(with @xmath116 denoting the adjoint of @xmath110 ) and showing that the solutions of ( 44 ) , do not belong to hilbert space @xmath117 ( we refer to @xcite for detailed mathematical analysis )",
    ". this will be achieved by defining the function space on each @xmath118constant hypersurface @xmath119 as @xmath120 with the following norm given for the metric ( 10 ) as,@xmath121      the timelike naked singularity for the metric ( 10 ) will be probed with massive scalar particles ( bosons ) satisfying the klein - gordon equation@xmath122 -\\tilde{m}^{2}\\right ) \\psi = 0,\\]]in which @xmath123 is the mass of the scalar particle .",
    "equation ( 46 ) for the metric ( 10 ) is given below by splitting temporal and spatial part as@xmath124 \\frac{\\partial \\psi } { \\partial \\rho } -\\left ( \\frac{c-4v_{0}\\rho } { % \\rho } \\right ) \\frac{\\partial ^{2}\\psi } { \\partial \\theta",

    "if there are no square integrable ( @xmath127 ) solutions ( i.e. with deficiency indicies @xmath128 ) in the entire space , the operator @xmath110 possesses a unique self - adjoint extension and it is called essentially self - adjoint . consequently , the method to find a sufficient condition for the operator @xmath110 to be essentially self - adjoint is to investigate the solutions satisfying equation ( 44 )  that do not belong to the hilbert space @xmath117 .",
