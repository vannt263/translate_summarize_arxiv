    "the cloverleaf is the gravitationally lensed image of the distant quasar h1413 + 117 ( 14@xmath6 15@xmath7 46@xmath8.23 ; @xmath9 j2000.0 ) at @xmath10 showing four spots with angular separations from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . since its discovery ( magain et al .",
    "1988 ) , the cloverleaf has been observed spectroscopically and imaged with ground based telescopes in various bands from b to i ( kayser et al 1990 , hereafter k90 , angonin et al 1990 , arnould et al 1993 ) as well as at 3.6 cm with the vla ( k90 ) .",
    "models of the gravitational lens , involving one or two galaxies , were derived from these data sets , with some emphasis put on the vla radio map ( k90 ) .",
    "recently , keeton , kochanek and seljak ( 1997 ) ( hereafter kks ) in a theoretically motivated paper studying `` shear '' in gravitational lens quads system , presented singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) plus external shear lens models for most quads and in particular for the cloverleaf .",
    "the main difficulty with these models lies in the fact that they predict , for a z=1.44 lens , a mass of @xmath2 2.5 @xmath13 @xmath14 m@xmath5 within @xmath15 ( 6 @xmath14 kpc ) radius , which would correspond to a relatively bright normal galaxy : so far , searches in the k band of the predicted ` bright ' lensing galaxies have been unsuccessful ( lawrence 1996 ) and this fact remains a mystery .",
    "hst observations of the cloverleaf have been done in different modes : falco ( 1993 ) presented a short report on the pre - costar hst / wfpc image ( used for the lens model derived by yun et al ( 1997 ) ) , turnshek ( 1996 ) discussed fos observations , and a recent preprint by turnshek et al ( 1997 ) described pc observations ( pre- and post - costar ) .",
    "however , the post - costar hst / wfpc2 ( pc and wf ) data have not been fully exploited yet , though they may bring new constraints on the gravitational lens modeling .",
    "new information also comes from the detection of the cloverleaf in the molecular co transitions ( barvainis et al 1994 , wilner et al 1995 , barvainis et al 1997 , yun et al 1997 , alloin et al 1997 ) .",
    "both the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the quasar can be studied in detail ( barvainis et al 1997 ) and the gravitational lens model could be improved . indeed , unveiling the gravitational lens nature of the cloverleaf in co ( alloin et al 1997 ) provides the true intensity ratios of the four spots , unaffected by absorption from intervening material , and unaffected by microlensing effects as the co source in the quasar",
    "is not point - like ( a gravitational shear is measured on the 3 brightest co spots a , b & c ) .",
    "however , the different parts of the co source suffering different amplification , the co intensity ratios can not be compared directly to the optical ones : this explains the corresponding observed differences reported by alloin et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "an improved co(7 - 6 ) map , presented in this paper , has been obtained with the iram interferometer , giving further insight into the geometry of the quasar co source .",
    "in addition , ccd images of the cloverleaf over a 5 field of view ( cfht / focam archives ) allow precise astrometry of the field and a better registration of the maps obtained through various wavebands , with a particular interest in the optical and the millimeter ones .    in the current paper , we take into account all these new constraints in order to derive an improved model of the gravitational lens and of the quasar molecular source .",

    "4 the results of the astrometry performed from archived cfht / focam images and , using the co(7 - 6 ) high resolution map obtained with the iram interferometer , we position very accurately the optical and millimeter data sets .",

    "the combined data lead to the cleaned integrated map restored with a @xmath23 circular beam shown in figure  [ fig : iram]a . in order to search for a velocity gradient",
    ", we have first derived the spatially integrated line profile , following the procedure already discussed in alloin et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the new co(7 - 6 ) line profile , shown in figure  [ fig : lineprofile ] , exhibits a marked asymmetry with a steep rise on its blue side and a slower decrease on its red side .",
    "excluding the central velocity channel ( so that the split in velocity is symmetric ) , we have built the blue ( -225,-25 km / s ) and the red ( + 25,+225 km / s ) maps displayed in figures  [ fig : iram]c and [ fig : iram]d respectively .",
    "the difference between the red - shifted and blue - shifted cleaned maps ( figure  [ fig : iram]b ) establishes definitely the presence of a velocity gradient at the 8@xmath3 level .",
    "the implication of these results on the co source will be discussed more thoroughly in sect .",

    "i.e. _ deconvolved by the interferometer beam .",
    "although the measurements have not been corrected for seeing effects ( mean seeing estimate of the order of @xmath24 ) the spots a , b and c appear to be definitely elongated ( see figure  [ fig : cloverleaf ] for spot labels ) .",
    "the hst data of the cloverleaf used in this analysis have been provided by the eso / st - ecf science archive facility ( garching ) .",
    "two data sets obtained with the wfpc2 are presented here .",
    "the first one was obtained by turnshek ( 1994 july 12 [ id:5442 ] & 1994 december 23 [ id:5621 ] ) and the second one by westphal ( 1995 april 27 [ id:5772 ] ) .",
    "turnshek s observations aimed at discovering the lensing galaxy .",
    "they consist in wfpc-2 images and fos spectra of the four quasar images and of the suspected lensing object .",
    "these observations were not successful in finding the lensing galaxy , but the fos spectra of the four quasar spots have been discussed by turnshek ( 1996 ) .",
    "a recent preprint by turnshek et al ( 1997 ) discussed the pc observations ( id:5442 and 5621 as well as archival pre - costar observations ) , giving astrometry and color variation of the different spots ( the latter which they explained by dust absorption ) .",
    "they also put some limits on the detection of the primary lensing galaxy .",
    "observations of the cloverleaf by westphal are part of a larger programme to study multiple quasars and their environments .",
    "standard reduction procedures using iraf / stsdas packages have been applied .",
    "the absolute photometry was obtained using magnitude zero - points given in holtzmann et al .",
    "information about the final images in filter f336w ( central rest wavelength @xmath2 945  ) , f555w ( central rest wavelength @xmath2 1560  ) , f702w ( central rest wavelength @xmath2 1975  ) , and f814w ( central rest wavelength @xmath2 2290  ) are summarized in table  [ tab : journal ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the comparison with previous models presented by k90 and recently by yun et al ( 1997 ) and kks is somewhat difficult .",
    "first , none of these included a lensing contribution from a distant galaxy cluster ( our model 2 ) .",
    "regarding the properties of the individual lensing galaxy , the k90 model 1 ( see table  4 and figure  4a of k90 ) and kks are `` close '' to our results of model 1 .",
    "the relative position of the source and the lensing galaxy center are almost identical and the orientation of the gravitational potential is similar ( pa of 20@xmath25 for k90 , 21.6@xmath25 for kks , and 21.5@xmath25 for our model 1 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the velocity dispersion we find when no cluster component is introduced is 280 km / s , in excellent agreement with their upper limit ( @xmath26285 km / sec ) .",
    "but on the other hand , our ellipticity is significantly different .",
    "k90 used the standard definition of the eccentricity ( @xmath27 ) for the projected mass density , the corresponding ellipticity is @xmath28 , which is 3.5 times larger than in our results .",
    "kks found an ellipticity of 0.58 for an elliptical sis model , and for a two shear model ( elliptical sis plus external shear ) an ellipticity of 0.40 with a external shear of 0.19 .",
    "this difference results from the analytical form of the mass profile chosen : k90 and kks used a sis while we are using a sum of two truncated emds with two parameters for the shape of the profile .",
    "then , more freedom is given in the radial mass profile , leading to solutions with smaller ellipticities ( cf .",
    "the model of h14176 and discussion in hjorth & kneib 1997 ) .    on the contrary",
    ", our results do not agree with those by yun et al ( 1997 ) who find a lensing elliptical potential perpendicular to that derived by k90 and to ours ( due to the presence of a strong external shear ? ) .",
    "indeed , the four co spots observed ( and predicted by our lens model ) better constrain the orientation of the potential ( although they do not insure the uniqueness of the solution ) .",
    "in addition to the size of the quasar co source , @xmath2 460 pc fwhm , as derived above ( see sect .",
    "5.2 ) , we can obtain some information on its substructure using the velocity gradient observed in the co(7 - 6 ) line ( figure  [ fig : iram]b ) .",
    "indeed , the map ( figure  [ fig : iram]c ) corresponding to the blue side of the line ( -225,-25 km / s ) shows that spot c is stronger and slightly displaced inwards with respect to its counterpart in the map corresponding to the ( + 25,+225 km / s ) , shown in ( figure  [ fig : iram]d ) .",
    "a hint of this effect can be found in yun et al ( 1997 ) although a close comparison of the iram results with the ovro one is hampered by the fact that in their study the spatial resolution is twice lower , the line profile is not shown , the velocity interval considered  145 km / s  is narrower than ours ",
    "200km / s  and not positioned precisely with respect to the line center .",
    "therefore , we shall concentrate now on the interpretation of the iram data set only . using the two lens models obtained in sect .",
    "5.2 , we optimized the structure of the co source to reproduce separately the red and the blue images ( figure  [ fig : modelco ] ) .",
    "we call attention to the fact that a precise registration ( better than @xmath29 ) of the co map and the hst data is required to achieved a detailed structure of the co source",
    ". the current data does not allow such an accurate registration , so we fine tune it so that the lens morphology between radio and optical match is best .",
    "we tested the registration and found that a @xmath30 offsets does not change the results presented below .",
    "a larger offset make the radio and optical data inconsistent on a lens modelling point of view .    for model 1 [ resp .",
    "model 2 ] , we find an offset of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 pc ) [ resp .",
    "@xmath33 ( @xmath34 pc ) ] between the center of regions emitting the blue and red parts of the co line ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : modelco ] ) .",
    "we have tested this procedure against uncertainties in the co / hst images registration .",
    "a change by @xmath30 ( half a co map pixel ) has very minor impact on the positions of the source regions emitting the blue and red parts of the line .",
    "the quasar point - like visible source appears to be almost exactly centered between the blue- and red - emitting regions .",
    "this is reminiscent of a disk- or ring - like structure orbiting the quasar at the radius of @xmath2 100 pc [ resp .",
    "75 pc ] and with a keplerian velocity of @xmath2 100 km / s ( assuming a 90 deg inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ) , the resultating central mass would be @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 [ resp . @xmath2",
    "7.5 10@xmath35 m@xmath5 ] . elaborating a more sophisticated ( realistic ) model of the co source and its link with",
    "the bal feature also observed in this quasar is beyond the current analysis but should be performed in the future . regarding the spot fluxes in co(7 - 6 ) as derived from the maps in figures  [ fig : iram]a , [ fig : iram]c , [ fig : iram]d and table  [ tab : spotiram ] , a comparison with the fluxes given previously in alloin et al ( 1997 ) is not straightforward because the velocity interval over which the integration has been performed is different in the two studies ( -225,+225 km / s vs. -325,325 km / s ) .",
    "the amplification factor being extremely sensitive to the position of the emitting region with respect to the caustic , any velocity - positional changes within the source can result in a different configuration in the image plane .",
    "such gradients are likely to occur in the molecular torus of the standard agn model .",
    "the differential amplification resulting from this gradient is probably at the origin of the asymmetry observed in the line profile ( figure  [ fig : lineprofile ] ) .",
    "the complete multi - wavelength analysis of the cloverleaf reveals that this is probably a complex lens which includes a lensing galaxy and an additional distant lensing cluster of galaxies .",
    "the reality of the cluster toward the cloverleaf has still to be confirmed independently . even at the level of a 4 @xmath3 detection , clustering and projection effects",
    "can not be readily discarded to explain the observed galaxy enhancement , and measuring the redshift of these galaxies is of high priority to position them in redshift space .    yet , most of the galaxies around the cloverleaf are found in the same magnitude and size ranges , as expected if they indeed belonged to a cluster . if the cluster is at a very large distance , the shift of its galaxy luminosity function up to higher apparent magnitude would explain why the number - density contrast of the cluster with respect to faint field galaxies is lowered down to only a 4 @xmath3 level .",
    "this interpetation implies that the lensing galaxy may not be very massive and consequently may not be very luminous , helping to explain the mystery of the lensing galaxy not having been detected so far .",
    "the drawback is that , despite the constraint that the shapes of the co spots provide on the orientation of the mass density distribution , it mandates sharing the mass between the lensing - galaxy and the lensing - cluster which increases the number of possible lens configurations .",
    "hence , it considerably reduces the chances to infer a secure measure of the hubble constant from the time delay measurements of lightcurves between the four spots ( a thorough report of the variability of the quasar is given in stensen et al .",
    "1997 ) . a measure of time - delay would bring additional constraint on the mass distributioin of this system .",
    "thus , we need to confirm , probably from ultra - deep visible images and spectra and additional near infrared photometry , that the cluster is there and that it is at a large redshift .",
    "ultra - deep visible and k band images might also reveal the position and the shape of the light distribution of the lensing galaxy .",
    "such information would be useful to improve the mapping of the co source , as already emphasised by yun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and alloin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with the present - day data ,",
    "the co source is found to be a disk- or ring - like structure with typical radius of @xmath2 100 pc , under the lens model of a galaxy and a cluster at z=1.7 , leading to a central @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 object , typical of a black - hole .",
    "it is amazing to see that a disk with such a small intrinsic size can be spatially  resolved \" even at an angular distance as large as 1.6 @xmath14 gpc .",
    "however , we are aware that the co source could have a more complex geometry and as long as the exact redshift and mass distribution of the lenses will not be known in a direct way , uncertainties on the co source size and structure will persist .",
    "although this remains to be confirmed independently , the discovery of a distant cluster of galaxies on the line of sight to the cloverleaf is remarkable because it reinforces the suspicion that many bright high redshift quasars are magnified by cluster - like systems at large distances .",
    "this was already reported from analyses in the fields of the doubly imaged quasar q2345 + 007 ( bonnet et al 1993 ; mellier et al 1994 ; van waerbeke et al 1997 ) , where a cluster candidate is expected to be at z@xmath2 0.75 ( pell et al 1996 ) and of mg2016 where the x - ray emission of the intra - cluster gas has been observed and for which the iron line ( from x - ray spectroscopy ) gives a redshift z@xmath21 ( hattori et al 1997 ) .",
    "+ these cases of strong lensing may substantially change the intrinsic bright - end luminosity function of quasars .",
    "in fact , there is now convincing evidence that magnification biases play an important role and this should draw some important cosmological issues",
    ". early observational evidence was emphazised by the galaxy - quasar associations detected by fugmann ( 1990 ) .",
    "they have been re - investigated and confirmed by bartelmann & schneider ( 1994 ) and beitez & martnez - gonzalez ( 1996 ) . according to bartelmann & schneider ( 1992 ) the galaxy - quasar association on arcminute scale",
    "can not be explained by lensing effects from single galaxies only , but must involve lensing effects by large - scale structure or rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "since all these sources , including the cloverleaf , are very bright , they correspond to preferentially selected fields which probe the bright - end of the magnified areas where we expect that the lensing agent responsible for magnification must be strong .",
    "if so , many bright quasars are magnified by massive gravitational systems .",
    "it would therefore be important to collect ultra - deep visible and near infrared high - resolution imaging on a large sample of overbright quasars in order to compute what fraction is surrounded by high - redshift foreground clusters of galaxies .",
    "though these fields correspond to biased lines of sight , they are typical fields showing the strong - end of cosmic shear events expected on arcminute scales from the predictions of jain & seljak ( 1996 ) . by using the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum",
    ", these authors have shown that the rms cosmic shear on such scales is more than twice the values predicted from the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "arguing that the cosmic shear should therefore be observable even with present - day ground based telescopes , schneider et al ( 1997 ) have re - analysed the fort et al ( 1996 ) data and have shown that the cosmic shear may have already been detected in at least one quasar field ( pks1508 ) .",
    "very deep observations of the cloverleaf in the near ir , to confirm that a shear pattern with significant shear amplitude of order of 5% is present around the four spots , would provide independent data in favor of the this interpretation .",
    "the observation of cosmic shear or the detection of distant clusters puts strong constraints on the density parameter @xmath37 and on the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "if most of the bright quasars are magnified by high - redshift clusters , then the density of distant clusters of galaxies must be large ( this may conflict with the standard cdm model for example ) .",
    "however , the impact on cosmological scenarios is not clear since we do not understand yet the selection biases .",
    "though our multiwavelength analysis , using the best visible and co images , provides a new interpretation of the cloverleaf and a good understanding of the lens configuration , the discussion raises new questions about the co source and the lenses . in order to address these questions thouroughly ,",
    "additional photometric and spectroscopic data are required .",
    "since the members of the cluster are extremely faint their spectroscopy and the measurement of the cluster velocity dispersion will be technically difficult .",
    "in addition to ultra - deep visible and near infrared imaging to probe the light distribution of the lenses ( individual galaxy and cluster ) , the mass model representing the cluster could be considerably improved by using the shear pattern generated by the lensed background sources and from the redshift measurements of the ` brightest ' cluster members .",
    "last but not least , the photometric monitoring of the four spots ( stensen et al 1997 ) will provide the time delay of the light curves which is also an important and independent constraint for the mass modelling .",
