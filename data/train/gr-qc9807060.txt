    "stimulated by the developments of superstring theory , various cosmological solutions based on string theory have been proposed .",
    "although the theory has not developed enough to present a unique history of our universe in its earliest stage , one may now imagine that the big bang is no longer just a point of enigma named the initial singularity but has a rich and complex structure .    among these string - based universe models",
    ", the most widely studied would be the so - called pre - big - bang model@xcite ( in the literature it is often called string cosmology ) .",
    "the remarkable aspect of this model is that it tries to explain the inflationary behavior of the early universe by introducing a polelike acceleration phase ( superinflation ) which is driven by the kinetic term of the dilaton .",
    "this superinflationary branch of the solution has a dual relation named the scale factor duality with the friedmann branch , which is the usual decelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the biggest problem arising in the pre - big - bang model is the difficulty of connecting the superinflationary branch and the friedmann branch ( termed the graceful exit problem ) , and there are no - go theorems proved under some assumptions@xcite .",
    "antoniadis , rizos , and tamvakis@xcite proposed a nonsingular ( i.e. free of the graceful exit problem ) cosmological model by including the 1-loop ( genus ) correction term in the low - energy string effective action .",
    "this 1-loop model is excellent in that it gives a simple example of the smooth transition between the superinflationary branch and the friedmann branch .",
    "this original 1-loop model involves dilaton and modulus fields , and there is a simplified version@xcite by rizos and tamvakis with a modulus field only .",
    "this metric - modulus system gives essentially the same nonsingular solution as the full metric - dilaton - modulus system , since the behavior of the solution mainly depends only on the modulus field .",
    "the existence of the nonsingular solution is analytically shown by rizos and tamvakis@xcite for the friedmann - robertson - walker metric , i.e. , assuming the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "we studied whether the nature of this nonsingular solution is affected if anisotropy is included .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the solution of this metric - modulus system to include anisotropy and to observe the behavior of its solutions , particularly of nonsingular ones .",
    "the following sections of this paper are organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the isotropic case studied by rizos and tamvakis@xcite , and then derive the basic equations of motion from the effective action for the bianchi type i metric .",
    "we also solve these equations analytically in the asymptotic region . in sec .",
    "iii we solve these equations numerically .",

    "this solution , examples of which are s1c and s1d of figs.7 and 8 , can be regarded as a pair creation of two branches .",
    "the singular solution in the isotropic model@xcite is a special case of this second singular solution .",
    "the third singular solution lies always in the @xmath99 region and never crosses the @xmath100 line , i.e. , includes no type i singularity .",
    "this solution is born in the type ii singularity , and disappears into the type ii singularity ( see s2 of figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "in this paper we presented anisotropic nonsingular cosmological solutions derived from the 1-loop effective action of the heterotic string .",
    "we found nonsingular solutions which evolve from the infinite past asymptotic region , superinflate , and then continue either to friedmann - type or kasner - type solutions .",
    "the singular solutions of moderate anisotropy are classified into three types , and involved in these solutions are two types of singularities : one corresponds to @xmath100 and the other to @xmath153 .",
    "the initial singularity in the isotropic limit is a special case of the @xmath100 singularity .",
    "violation of the energy conditions , which is necessary to avoid the singularity , is achieved by the existence of a gauss - bonnet term coupled to a modulus field .",
    "this can be confirmed by using the asymptotic forms ( [ eqn : assola ] ) and ( [ eqn : assolb ] ) for nonsingular solutions .",
    "we define the effective energy density and effective pressure as @xmath154 assuming the asymptotic solution @xmath73 in the region @xmath76 and that @xmath40 is always positive ( in our numerical analysis @xmath40 keeps its sign except the singular solution s2 ) , the effective energy density and pressure behave in the future asymptotic region as @xmath155 , @xmath156 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus , the weak energy condition @xmath157 and the strong energy condition @xmath158 are satisfied . in the past asymptotic region",
    ", on the other hand , the asymptotic solution becomes @xmath74 in which the gauss - bonnet term is dominant",
    ". then @xmath159 and @xmath160 , etc .",
    "if the weak energy condition is satisfied , @xmath161 for @xmath91 , and so @xmath162 must be positive . if the strong energy condition is satisfied , @xmath163 must be positive . neither of them is possible as long as @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , weak and strong energy conditions are violated in the past asymptotic region .",
    "one of the biggest advantages of our model is that it includes a rather long period of ( super)inflationary stage in a natural form .",
    "our result , which admits the evolution of an almost - isotropic superinflating solution into a kasner - type anisotropic solution ( see the panel `` nsb '' of fig . 5 for example ) , suggests that the superinflation in our model does not isotropize the space - time .",
    "our recent study@xcite of the cosmological perturbation for the homogeneous and isotropic background shows the existence of exponential growth in graviton - mode perturbation during the superinflationary stage .",
    "together with this we can conclude that the cosmic no - hair hypothesis @xcite does not hold in this superinflationary model .",
    "we are interested in whether this result is common to all kinetic - driven superinflation .",
