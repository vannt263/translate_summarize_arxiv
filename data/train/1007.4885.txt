    "the phase diagram of lattice weinberg - salam model contains physical higgs phase , where scalar field is condensed and gauge bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 acquire their masses .",
    "this physical phase is bounded by the phase transition surface . crossing this surface one leaves the physical phase and enters the phase of the lattice theory that has nothing to do with the conventional continuum electroweak theory . in the physical phase of the theory the electroweak symmetry",
    "is broken spontaneously while in the unphysical phase the electroweak symmetry is not broken .    moving along the line of constant physics in the direction of the increase of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the lattice spacing ) we approach the transition surface .",
    "we find the indications that there exists the maximal possible ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 within the physical phase .",
    "our estimate ( for the higgs mass @xmath9 gev ) is @xmath10 tev .",
    "it is important to compare this result with the limitations on the ultraviolet cutoff , that come from the perturbation theory .",
    "the latter appear as a consequence of the triviality problem , which is related to landau pole in scalar field self coupling @xmath11 . due to the landau pole",
    "the renormalized @xmath11 is zero , and the only way to keep it equal to its measured value is to impose the limitation on the cutoff .",

    "the correspondent energy scale calculated within the perturbation theory is much larger , than @xmath3 tev . in particular , for @xmath13 gev this value is about @xmath14 tev .    on the tree level the w - boson ( z- boson ) mass in lattice units vanishes on the transition line at small enough @xmath11 .",

    "( actually , the situation , when the cutoff tends to infinity at the position of the transition point means that there is a second order phase transition . )    in table 1 of @xcite the data on the ultraviolet cutoff achieved in selected lattice studies of the @xmath18 gauge higgs model are presented . everywhere",

    "this table shows that the maximal value of the cutoff @xmath23 ever achieved in these studies is around @xmath2 tev .",
    "possible explanation of the mentioned discrepancy between lattice results and the results given by the perturbation theory is that in some vicinity of the transition the perturbation theory does not work .",
    "indeed we find that there exists the vicinity of the phase transition between the higgs phase and the symmetric phase in the weinberg - salam model , where the fluctuations of the scalar field become strong and the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum can not be applied .",
