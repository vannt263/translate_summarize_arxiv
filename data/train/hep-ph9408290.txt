    "with the discovery of heavy quark symmetry ( for a review see ref .",

    "model dependence enters this analysis only at the level of power corrections , which are suppressed by a factor of at least @xmath9 .",
    "these corrections can be investigated in a systematic way using the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "they are found to be small , of the order of a few per cent .    until recently ,",
    "this method to determine @xmath1 was limited by large experimental uncertainties of about 1520% , which were much larger than the theoretical uncertainties in the analysis of symmetry - breaking corrections . however , three collaborations have now presented results of higher precision @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to reconsider the status of the theoretical analysis , even more so since the original analysis of power corrections in ref .",
    "@xcite has become the subject of some controversy @xcite .    besides reviewing some of the existing calculations ,",
    "the main purpose of this note is to propose a `` constructive synthesis '' of the two approaches that have been suggested to obtain an estimate of the power corrections to the decay form factor at zero recoil .",
    "these corrections are parametrized by a quantity @xmath10 .",
    "the `` exclusive approach '' of falk and myself @xcite has the advantage that it provides an exact expression for @xmath10 involving five hadronic parameters , which are defined in terms of matrix elements of higher - dimensional operators in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the final numerical estimate is model - dependent , since four of these five parameters are not precisely known .",
    "the `` inclusive approach '' of shifman _",
    "et al_.  @xcite provides an upper bound for @xmath10 in terms of only two parameters ; however , it is not clear to which extent this bound is saturated .",
    "we shall combine the two approaches and derive non - trivial constraints on the hadronic parameters in the formula for @xmath10 .",
    "these constraints help to reduce the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "let us start with a short discussion of the decay kinematics @xcite .",
    "the hadronic matrix element describing the decay process @xmath7 can be parametrized by invariant helicity amplitudes corresponding to transverse and longitudinal polarization of the @xmath11 meson . as kinematic variable",
    ", we choose the product of the meson velocities , @xmath12 , which is related to the momentum transfer @xmath13 to the lepton pair by @xmath14 the differential decay rate @xmath15 is proportional to the sum over the squared helicity amplitudes , which up to a kinematic factor defines the square of a function @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting expression is @xmath17\\,|\\,v_{cb}|^2\\,{\\cal f}^2(w ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the heavy quark effective theory allows the factorization of the short- and long - distance contributions to @xmath16 into a perturbative coefficient @xmath18 and a hadronic form factor @xmath19 : @xmath20 in the heavy quark limit , this hadronic form factor agrees with the isgur  wise function @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 to indicate that the two functions differ by terms suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy quark masses .",
    "luke s theorem determines the normalization of @xmath19 at zero recoil ( @xmath22 ) up to second - order power corrections @xcite : @xmath23 the strategy proposed in ref .",

    "the task of theorists is to provide a reliable calculation of the symmetry - breaking corrections contained in @xmath18 and @xmath10 in order to turn this measurement into a precise determination of @xmath1 . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we briefly review the status of the calculation of short - distance corrections . a new theoretical analysis of power corrections is given in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we give a theoretical prediction for the slope of the form factor @xmath19 at zero recoil .",
    "this parameter is important for the extrapolation of experimental data to @xmath22 .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] contains a summary of the numerical results and some conclusions .",
    "the short - distance coefficient @xmath18 takes into account a finite renormalization of the axial vector current in the region @xmath30 .",
    "its calculation is a straightforward application of qcd perturbation theory . at the one - loop order",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath31 the scale of the running coupling constant is not determined at this order .",
    "choosing @xmath32 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and using @xmath35 , one obtains values in the range @xmath36 .",
    "the scale ambiguity leads to an uncertainty of order @xmath37 ^ 2\\sim 2\\%$ ] .",
    "the calculation can be improved by using the renormalization group to resum the leading and next - to - leading logarithms of the type @xmath38^n$ ] , @xmath39^n$ ] , and @xmath40^n$ ] to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "a consistent scheme for a next - to - leading - order calculation of @xmath41 has been developed in ref .",
    "the result is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical result is very stable under changes of the input parameters . using @xmath45 gev ( for four flavours ) and",
    "@xmath35 , one obtains @xmath46 .",
    "the uncertainty arising from next - to - next - to - leading corrections is of order @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( [ etaa ] ) is an exact result to a given order in perturbation theory .",
    "we stress that , since next - to - leading effects are properly included , it is not only valid for large values of @xmath48 . therefore , we disagree with the criticism of this calculation by the authors of ref .  @xcite .",
    "of course , it would be desirable to know the non - logarithmic terms of order @xmath49 in @xmath18 , but we see no reason why these terms should be unusually large . taking this usual perturbative uncertainty into account , we believe it is conservative to increase the error by a factor 2.5 and quote @xmath50",
    "hadronic uncertainties enter the determination of @xmath1 at the level of second - order power corrections , which are expected to be of order @xmath51 . for a precision measurement of @xmath1 ,",
    "it is important to understand the structure of these corrections in detail . in our discussion ( as in all previous analyses ) , we will investigate the @xmath2 corrections at the tree level , thereby neglecting effects of order @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , we will not discuss the running of the hadronic parameters of the effective theory . in view of the theoretical uncertainty in the estimate of these non - perturbative parameters , this is a safe approximation .    using the technology of the heavy quark effective theory , falk and myself",
    "have derived the exact expression @xcite @xmath53 which depends upon five hadronic parameters that are independent of the heavy quark masses .",
    "they have the following physical significance : @xmath54 and @xmath55 parametrize the deficit in the `` wave - function overlap '' between @xmath56- and @xmath57-flavoured pseudoscalar ( _ p _ ) and vector ( _ v _ ) mesons .",
    "for instance , @xmath54 is defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a short - distance correction factor @xcite , and we use a mass - independent normalization of meson states .",
    "the corresponding relation for vector mesons defines @xmath55 .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside a heavy meson , and @xmath61 determines the vector ",
    "pseudoscalar mass splitting arising from operators in the effective lagrangian that break the heavy quark spin symmetry . from the observed mass splitting between @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons , one obtains @xmath64 gev@xmath65",
    "finally , @xmath66 parametrizes certain matrix elements containing two insertions of operators that break the spin symmetry . in our analysis",
    "below , we will assume that this parameter is small , i.e.  of a magnitude similar to @xmath67 or smaller .",
    "this assumption is supported by qcd sum rule calculations of other spin - symmetry - breaking corrections to heavy quark decay form factors @xcite .    with the exception of @xmath67 , estimates of these hadronic parameters",
    "are model - dependent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we made the simplifying assumptions that @xmath68 , and that the corrections represented by @xmath66 are negligible .",
    "using then reasonable values such as @xmath69 gev@xmath65 and @xmath70 gev@xmath65 , one obtains @xmath71 . here and in the following , we take @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 gev for the heavy quark masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the error in the estimate of @xmath10 has been increased to @xmath74 in order to account for the model dependence and higher - order corrections .",
    "a very similar result , @xmath75 , has been obtained by mannel @xcite .",
    "recently , shifman _",
    "et al_.  have suggested an alternative approach to obtain an estimate of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to apply an operator product expansion to the @xmath76-meson matrix element of the time - ordered product of two flavour - changing heavy quark currents , and to equate the resulting theoretical expression to a phenomenological expression obtained by saturating the matrix element with physical intermediate states .",
    "this leads to sum rules , which can be used to derive inequalities for the @xmath77 transition form factors at zero recoil . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such bounds have been obtained for the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath10 .",
    "they are @xmath78 where @xmath79 the first relation in ( [ sumrul1 ] ) implies that @xcite @xmath80 excluding some of the values for the parameter @xmath81 used in previous analyses of @xmath10 .",
    "it implies that the average heavy quark momentum inside the heavy meson is quite large , of order 600 mev .",
    "ball and braun have calculated @xmath81 using qcd sum rules and find @xmath82 gev@xmath65 @xcite . below we shall use @xmath83 gev@xmath65 .",
    "we will comment on the ( weak ) dependence of our results on the value of @xmath81 later . the upper bound for @xmath10 in ( [ sumrul1 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath84 . of course , a crucial question is to what extent this inequality is saturated .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite make an `` educated guess '' that @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath86 .",
    "however , the arguments presented to support this guess are not very rigorous .",
    "it seems more appealing to us to use the sum rules to constrain the hadronic parameters in ( [ delm2 ] ) .",
    "we first note that it is possible to derive two additional relations by interchanging pseudoscalar with vector meson states , corresponding to transitions of the type @xmath87 . repeating the derivations of ref .",
    "@xcite for this case , we find @xmath88 where @xmath89 is obtained from @xmath10 in ( [ delm2 ] ) by interchanging @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the first relation in ( [ sumrul2 ] ) puts a bound on the parameter @xmath55 . to obtain further constraints",
    ", we use the fact that the above relations are valid for an arbitrary value of the mass ratio @xmath90 . comparing the second relation in ( [ sumrul1 ] ) with ( [ delm2 ] ) in the limit @xmath91 , we find that @xmath92 moreover , as long as @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath94 we are free to choose any value of the mass ratio @xmath90 between 0 and 1 to make these relations as restrictive as possible .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath95 for small values of @xmath66 , this relation implies a correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is such that @xmath96 gev@xmath65 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where we show the allowed regions in the @xmath54@xmath55 plane for different values of @xmath66 . in total , we have thus identified three effects , which decrease @xmath10 with respect to the estimate given in ref .",
    "@xcite : a large value of @xmath97 , a positive value of @xmath66 , and the fact that @xmath55 is likely to be larger than @xmath54 provided that @xmath66 is small .    to proceed , it is convenient to introduce new parameters @xmath98 in terms of which @xmath99 the fact that @xmath100 implies @xmath101 .",
    "the inequality ( [ compl ] ) is equivalent to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 the main uncertainty in evaluating ( [ final ] ) comes from the unknown values of the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath66 . as a guideline",
    ", one may employ the constituent quark model of isgur _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , in which one uses non - relativistic harmonic oscillator wave functions for the ground - state heavy mesons , for instance @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the reduced mass .",
    "one then obtains @xmath107 gev@xmath65 , where we take @xmath108 gev for the light constituent quark mass , corresponding to the difference between the spin - averaged meson masses and the heavy quark masses .",
    "however , this estimate of @xmath104 is probably somewhat too low .",
    "lattice studies of heavy - light wave functions suggest an exponential behaviour of the form @xmath109 @xcite , which leads to @xmath110 gev@xmath65 .",
    "we believe that values much larger than this are unlikely , since we use a rather large constituent quark mass @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , adopting the point of view that the sum rules for @xmath54 and @xmath55 are saturated to approximately 50% by the ground - state contribution @xcite , one would expect @xmath112 gev@xmath65 , which seems a very reasonable value to us . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the allowed regions for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath66 for two values of @xmath104 . when @xmath113 is varied between 0.36 and 0.5 gev@xmath65 , the resulting values for @xmath10 change by less than 1% . for all reasonable choices of parameters ,",
    "the results are in the range @xmath114 .",
    "hence , we quote our new value as @xmath115 which is consistent with the previous estimates in refs .",
    "@xcite at the @xmath116 level",
    ". a more precise determination of the parameter @xmath104 would help to reduce the uncertainty in this number .",
    "we conclude this section with a word of caution .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the sum rules derived by shifman _ et al_.  in ref .",
    "@xcite suffer from a renormalon ambiguity ; in other words , they do not obey the renormalization - group equation if the theory is regulated with a hard momentum cutoff .",
    "this is a serious problem , which has to be solved before these sum rules can be used with confidence in phenomenological applications . here",
    ", we assume that the renormalon problem can be cured without changing the form of the sum rules .",
    "in the extrapolation of the differential decay rate ( [ bdrate ] ) to zero recoil , the slope of the function @xmath19 close to @xmath22 plays an important role . one defines a slope parameter @xmath117 by @xmath118 \\big\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] it is important to distinguish @xmath117 from the corresponding slope parameter @xmath119 of the isgur  wise function .",
    "they differ by corrections that break the heavy quark symmetry . whereas the slope of the isgur  wise function is a universal , mass - independent parameter , the slope of the physical form factor depends on logarithms and inverse powers of the heavy quark masses . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath117 is an observable quantity , while the value of @xmath119 depends on the renormalization scheme .    to establish the relation between the two parameters , it is convenient to introduce in an intermediate step the axial vector form factor @xmath120 defined as @xmath121 where the ellipses represent terms proportional to @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "the relation between the physical form factors @xmath19 and @xmath120 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . defining a slope parameter @xmath124 in analogy to ( [ rhohat ] )",
    ", we find @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote certain ratios of the @xmath128 decay form factors at zero recoil @xcite . in the heavy quark limit , @xmath129 , and",
    "the two slope parameters coincide .",
    "the symmetry - breaking corrections to these ratios have been analysed in detail . including both short - distance and @xmath130 corrections , which in this case can be calculated without much model dependence , one obtains @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xcite . from ( [ delrho ] )",
    ", it then follows that @xmath133 .",
    "recently , the form factor ratios @xmath126 and @xmath127 have been measured by the cleo collaboration , with the result that @xmath134 and @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath136 , in nice agreement with our theoretical prediction .",
    "the next step is to relate the form factor @xmath120 to the isgur  wise function .",
    "the matrix element that defines the isgur  wise function in the heavy quark effective theory is ultraviolet - divergent ( for @xmath137 ) and needs to be regularized by introducing a subtraction scale @xmath138 . to leading order in @xmath130 ,",
    "the regularized function @xmath139 is related to the physical form factor @xmath120 by a renormalization - group - invariant wilson coefficient function @xmath140 , which contains the dependence on the heavy quark masses , and a universal function @xmath141 containing the dependence on the renormalization scale @xcite : @xmath142 these functions are known to next - to - leading order in renormalization - group - improved perturbation theory . using the explicit expression for @xmath143 given in ref .",

    "this is by far the most accurate determination to date .",
    "we disagree with the conclusion of ref .",
