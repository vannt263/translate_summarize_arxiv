    "one of the most natural approaches to understand the quantum - mechanical properties of a black hole , e.g. the hawking radiation @xcite and the origin of the bekenstein entropy @xcite , is considering the structure of the black hole .",
    "the membrane - descriptions @xcite , the stretched horizon models @xcite and the quasi - particles model @xcite were proposed as this kind of approach .",
    "the d - brane descriptions of the ( near ) extremal - charged black hole succeeded in deriving the entropy @xcite and the hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "these approaches are just considering the dual structure of the black hole .",
    "hotta proposed the planck solid ball model based on the stretched horizon model .",
    "the structure of the schwarzschild black hole consists of a planck solid ball and a layer of radiation around the ball .",
    "there is no horizon and the radius of the ball is slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the planck solid is a hypothetical matter which arises by the stringy thermal phase transition due to the high temperature of the radiation .",
    "the temperature of the radiation around the ball ( near the horizon - scale ) becomes very high @xmath0 because of the blue - shift effect by the deep gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "both the bekenstein entropy and the mass of the black hole are carried by the radiation .",
    "the planck solid ball is proposed as a backreaction of the high temperature radiation into the space - time structure . if there arises no planck solid transition , it is natural to ask what occurs as the backreaction . in this paper",
    "we consider the backreaction of the thermal radiation by solving the einstein equation .",
    "we obtain a structure of _ the gravitationally - bounded radiation - ball with a singularity _ as a solution .",
    "the structure is spherically symmetric and is characterized by a parameter @xmath1 which means the radius of the radiation - ball .",
    "the structure has no horizon and the gravitational potential in the ball becomes quite deep @xmath2 .",
    "the exterior ( @xmath3 ) of the ball is identified as the schwarzschild black hole with radius @xmath1 . in the interior ( @xmath4 )",
    "there is a high density radiation @xmath5 with the planck temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the radiation is trapped in the ball by the deep gravitational potential .",
    "the total entropy of the radiation is proportional to the surface - area of the ball and is near the bekenstein entropy .",
    "the hawking radiation is regarded as a leak - out of the radiation from the surface of the ball .",
    "the singularity in the structure is naked and has quite large negative mass , however , the total mass of the structure ( the radiation and the singularity ) becomes the ordinary mass of the black hole with radius @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the schwarzschild black hole with the hawking radiation is identified as our structure and the bekenstein entropy is carried by the radiation in the ball .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is the following . in the next section",

    "in the situation we expect the local temperature distribution of the radiation as @xmath19 due to the effect of the gravitational potential @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "therefore the energy - density and the pressures of the radiation become @xmath21 respectively .",

    "the total radiation - energy around the black hole @xmath26 also diverges as @xmath27 .",
