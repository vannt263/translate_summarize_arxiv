    "in all these fields , new empirical data will be available in near future , which would allow the theories to be tested , but the complexity and the non - equilibrium nature of the phenomena make it difficult to derive theoretical predictions that could be compared with the data .",
    "one fairly generic consequence of phase transitions is formation of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "if the phase transition is associated with a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry , this process is well understood .",
    "the correlation length of the order parameter can not keep up with its equilibrium value , which diverges at the transition point .",
    "the direction of the symmetry breaking must therefore be uncorrelated at long distances , and at places where these correlated domains meet , topological defects are formed .",
    "this is called the kibble - zurek ( kz ) mechanism ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if the symmetry that gets broken is a local gauge invariance , the above argument can not be used directly , because the direction of the order parameter is not a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "we studied this recently in the context of the abelian higgs model  @xcite , and pointed out that the thermal fluctuations of the magnetic field lead to another mechanism that forms topological defects .",
    "the argument was based on fairly generic assumptions , but leads to some concrete predictions that were confirmed in numerical simulations .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study in more detail the dynamics of the abelian higgs model during the phase transition from the coulomb phase to the higgs phase . in particular , we concentrate on those degrees of freedom that are relevant for defect formation .",

    "a particularly interesting feature of this theory is the existence of nielsen - olesen vortex solutions @xcite .",
    "these string - like topological defects are characterized by a zero of the higgs field at the centre of the vortex around which the higgs phase angle has a non - zero winding number @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a closed path around the vortex and @xmath5 is the higgs phase angle , i.e. ,  @xmath6 .    at finite temperature ,",
    "perturbation theory is plagued by infrared divergences @xcite , which can be partly cured by a resummation of the perturbative expansion , but even the resummed expansion breaks down near the transition .",
    "static equilibrium quantities , such as the phase diagram of the theory , can still be calculated reliably with non - perturbative monte carlo simulations .",
    "the model has a phase transition between the high - temperature coulomb phase and the low - temperature higgs phase at @xmath7 . in the perturbative regime ( @xmath8 ) , the transition is of first order  @xcite , and at larger @xmath9 it becomes continuous  @xcite .",
    "there are no local order parameters , but a number of non - local ones : the photon mass and the vortex tension are non - zero in the broken phase and vanish at the transition  @xcite .",
    "therefore the transition is not a smooth crossover like the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations can not be used for real - time quantities in the quantum theory , because the necessary path integral is not euclidean but consists of a complicated path in complex time @xcite .",
    "however , we can utilize the fact that modes with different momenta behave in very different ways @xcite . the soft , long - wavelength modes ( @xmath10 )",
    "have large occupation numbers , and they can be approximated very well by a classical theory .",
    "this makes numerical simulations feasible , because the time - evolution of a classical field theory can be found simply by solving the equations of motion numerically .",
    "classical field theory at finite temperature is ultraviolet divergent , and thus the results depend on the lattice spacing @xmath11 .",
    "divergences like these are generic to all low - energy effective theories , and are exactly cancelled by corrections the high - momentum modes induce to the effective lagrangian . if one is only interested in static equilibrium quantities , these corrections can be calculated in the limit of high temperature and small lattice spacing @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12 the approach we use in sect .",

    "the latter work introduces a new local field @xmath27 , representing the departure from the equilibrium distribution function for hard particles with velocity @xmath28 . since the hard particles move at the speed of light , @xmath28 consists of two free coordinates , making @xmath29 a six - dimensional field . in our formulation ,",
    "part of the velocity dependence decouples from the dynamics of the soft modes , and we can describe exactly the same dynamics with two five - dimensional fields , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] is the cosine of the angle between the hard mode velocity and the gradient of the distribution function .",

    ", we perform the conformal rescaling @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "if we can neglect the expansion rate in comparison to the microscopic timescales of the theory , which are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the effect of this rescaling on the action is to replace the mass terms @xmath21 and @xmath50 by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the hard modes are assumed to be ultra - relativistic , so they will stay close to a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath53 .",
    "hence @xmath52 stays constant , as do the rescaled thermal corrections to the higgs mass , leaving the only time dependence in the parameter @xmath54 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the phase transition is triggered in this way , by a mass term decreasing below a critical value , but we believe that the qualitative features would not be very different if some of the other parameters were changing at the same time .",
    "when the system enters the higgs phase , nielsen - olesen vortices are formed . in the limit @xmath55 , this can be understood in terms of the kibble mechanism  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath56 approaches its critical value , the higgs correlation length @xmath57 grows , and if the system could remain in equilibrium it would eventually diverge at the transition point .",
    "however , @xmath57 can not grow arbitrarily fast , because at the very least it is constrained by the finite speed of light .",
    "therefore it remains finite if the transition takes place in finite time . at the transition point , the system consists of correlated domains of size @xmath58 determined by the maximum correlation length reached . in each of these domains , the phase angle of the higgs field",

    "is @xmath59    in practice , the maximal rate of change of the correlation length may be well below the speed of light , and this argument can indeed be made more precise by considering the dynamics of the system in more detail  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argued that this picture is not complete if @xmath60 .",
    "after all , the phase angle of the higgs field is not gauge invariant , and therefore arguments based on it can not apply . nevertheless ,",
    "if the amplitude of the magnetic field is small , we can fix the gauge in which @xmath61 , and then we can use the above picture in this gauge . in these cases the above kibble - zurek scenario should work .",
    "however , if the initial state is at a non - zero temperature , magnetic field is never exactly zero , and it must be taken into account .    in the symmetric phase ,",
    "the thermodynamics of the gauge field is described by ordinary electrodynamics .",
    "the energy of any magnetic field configuration is approximately given by @xmath62=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^3x\\vec{b}(\\vec{x})^2,\\ ] ] and the probability with which the thermal fluctuations can generate that configuration is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "let us consider a circular loop @xmath4 that bounds a surface @xmath64 .",
    "the magnetic flux through the surface is @xmath65 although this is zero on the average , it is non - zero in almost all configurations , and therefore the typical value , given by @xmath66 is non - zero . we can estimate its value by calculating the energy of the field configuration that minimizes the energy for a given value of @xmath67 . this minimal configuration is simply a magnetic dipole , and its energy is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the radius of the loop @xmath4 .",
    "thermal fluctuations can create this configuration if @xmath70 , and solving this for @xmath67 shows that the typical flux through the loop is @xmath71    when the system enters the higgs phase , magnetic flux is confined into flux tubes , which costs energy . therefore the dynamics tries to decrease the magnetic flux , but it can only do so at short distances , because the range of the interaction between the flux tubes decreases rapidly",
    ".    we can be more specific in fourier space .",
    "we can write the two - point correlator of the magnetic flux density @xmath72 as @xmath73 in the symmetric phase , different fourier modes @xmath74 behave as independent oscillators in thermal bath , and thus each of them has the same amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "when the system enters the broken phase , magnetic field becomes massive , and the equilibrium distribution changes into @xmath76 in order to stay in equilibrium , the amplitude of the long - wavelength modes must drop rapidly , but the time scale @xmath77 of the dynamics of these modes is very slow .",
    "it depends on the individual system , but in general @xmath78 thus the modes with @xmath38 less than some critical value @xmath79 can not remain in equilibrium . if we know @xmath77 , we can calculate @xmath79 from the condition @xmath80    the consequence of the above process is that there will be long - wavelength magnetic fields present even in the higgs phase . in particular , at distances less than @xmath81 it looks like there was a uniform external magnetic field .",
    "we can estimate that its amplitude @xmath82 is @xmath83 this magnetic flux must be confined into vortices , and because each vortex carries one flux quantum @xmath84 , the number density of vortices per unit area is @xmath85    even if we do not know @xmath77 , we can still make some concrete predictions based on this scenario .",
    "for instance , the spatial distribution of vortices turns out to be completely different than in the kz scenario . at distances shorter than @xmath81 , the magnetic field points in the same direction , which means that the vortices tend to be aligned , while in the kz scenario they prefer to be anti - aligned .",

    "the part of the hamiltonian that involves the hard modes is gaussian and therefore they can be integrated out exactly .",
    "this results in a theory with only the soft fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 and their canonical momenta .",
    "the gauss law leads to an extra debye screening term @xmath174 in the hamiltonian .. this would lead to an effective theory that is equivalent with dimensional reduction at one - loop order  @xcite .",

    "2 .    generate the hard modes in the background of the soft modes generated in step 1 .",
    "since the hamiltonian is gaussian it could in principle be diagonalized and the field values could be taken directly from a normal distribution .",
    "however , we did this only for @xmath35 and its momentum @xmath175 .",
    "note that the lowest legendre mode of @xmath175 is fixed by the gauss law , @xmath176 the field @xmath34 and its momentum @xmath177 were generated using a heat bath algorithm with around 5000 sweeps .",
    "again , we evolved the configurations taken from the thermal ensemble using the equations of motion ( [ equ : eomleg ] ) for the time @xmath104 , measuring the equal - time and real - time correlators .",
    "the equal - time correlator is shown as open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatcorr ] , and it agrees fairly well with the corresponding classical correlator .",
    "this time , the fit to the perturbative one - loop result ( [ equ : full1loop ] ) favours @xmath178 , which suggests that because of the presence of the hard modes , the transition point is at slightly larger @xmath56 than in the classical case , and that @xmath106 is very close to it .    because perturbation theory can not be trusted at low momenta , we do not adopt the perturbative result ( [ equ : pertknp ] ) , but instead we simply assume that the self energy is linear at small momenta @xmath179 and determine the coefficient @xmath180 from the best fit to the data , which gives @xmath181 and use this in our later estimates .",
    "the hard modes have a significant effect on the real - time correlators , shown in figs .",

    "in this paper we have presented a thorough study of the dynamics of the high temperature phase transition in the abelian higgs model , using both classical and htl improved approximations .",
    "the aims were twofold .",
    "the first was to measure the equilibrium properties of the theory , and in particular find the relevant timescale for the decay of the long wavelength modes of the gauge field , which were identified in @xcite as crucial to the understanding of vortex formation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we performed numerical simulations of the abelian higgs model phase transition in real time by using the classical theory and changing the mass parameter of the higgs field over a characteristic quench time @xmath153 . in this paper ,",
    "our second aim was to do the same quenches with the htl improved theory , and to compare the resulting scaling law for the number of vortices @xmath213 formed as a function of the quench time .",
    "our measurements of the equilibrium correlators show that perturbation theory gives a reasonable account of their behaviour , except perhaps for the plasmon damping rate .",
    "a new and unexpected result is that near the transition , the equal - time correlator exhibits power - law magnetic screening , with a coefficient that is similar but not equal to the perturbative one . in the htl improved simulations , the numerical values of the plasmon mass and the landau damping rate",
    "agree well with the perturbative values in the coulomb phase .",
    "for the plasmon damping rate , however , the measured value was significantly higher than the perturbative estimate . as might be expected , the agreement is not as good in the classical theory : although the plasmon mass agrees well , the dependence of the landau damping rate @xmath132 on wavenumber @xmath38 is @xmath214 rather than the expected @xmath215 .",
    "we found significant differences between the scaling laws for the classical simulations , and for htl improved quenches with @xmath173 and @xmath202 .",
    "the difference between the classical scaling law and the htl improved one with @xmath202 can be ascribed to the discrepancy in the landau damping rate , and lends force to the contention made in @xcite that it is the balancing of the cooling rate with the landau damping rate which decides the length scale above which the fields fall out of equilibrium .",
    "the difference between @xmath173 and @xmath202 can be understood as stemming from a lack of phase space in the hard modes , which causes the htl approximation to break down at times greater than @xmath216 .",
    "our simulations have been carried out to leading order in the couplings @xmath17 and @xmath9 , and hence do not include the effect of high momentum transfer scattering between the hard modes .",
    "however , the hard modes can still scatter by exchanging soft modes , we do not expect this to change the dynamics qualitatively on the relatively short time scales which we have been able to study . in very slow transitions",
    ", it may be that hard mode scattering and also non - perturbative effects in the photon self - energy start to become important and and the predicted scaling law @xmath217 ceases to be valid .",

    "in sect .  [ sect : ahm ] the local formulation of the htl improved abelian higgs model was described . in this appendix",
    "we detail the resulting equations of motion for the fields @xmath18 and @xmath95 and legendre modes @xmath35 and @xmath34 , which encode the effect of high momentum ( @xmath218 ) particles .",
    "these fields satisfy the equations of motion [ equ : formulation ] @xmath219 since these equations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are linear , it is easy to solve them and show that the dynamics of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is identical to the original non - local theory ( [ equ : nonloc ] ) .    not only is this reformulation of the theory local , but the equations of motion are in a canonical form and we can therefore write down the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath220 , { \\label{equ : hamf}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are the canonical momenta of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
