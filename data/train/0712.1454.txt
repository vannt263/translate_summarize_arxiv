    "due to the weakness of the sources detected the signal - to - noise ratio per baseline was insufficient to self - calibrate the data .",

    "the robust parameter ranges in value from + 5 to @xmath125 , with the maps made with robust=+5 ( equivalent to natural weighting of the visibility data ) having the highest sensitivity but the lowest angular resolution and the maps made with robust=@xmath125 ( equivalent to uniform weighting ) having the highest angular resolution but the lowest sensitivity . for each value of the robust parameter",
    "the map of each epoch was restored using a circular beam whose hpbw is the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of the synthesized beam obtained by concatenating the uv data of all the six epochs ( hpbw = 0@xmath529 for naturally weighted maps and hpbw",
    "= 0@xmath519 for uniformly weighted maps ) .",
    "this average restoring beam was adopted to facilitate comparison between the different epochs and to allow averaging of all the 3.6 cm images into a single image .",
    "we consider this procedure appropriate since the major and minor axes of the synthesized beams of the individual observing sessions ( see table [ tabla1 ] ) are within @xmath010% of the adopted average hpbw .",
    "to improve the sensitivity and uv coverage , we have concatenated the uv data from all the epochs to obtain single maps , which we will refer to as `` all - epochs '' maps .",
    "since some of the structures persist from one epoch to another , while others change , the procedure of concatenating data could result in spurious effects in the final images .",
    "therefore , we checked that the maps obtained by concatenating all the uv data do not show significant differences from the maps obtained by averaging all the single epoch maps .",
    "the 7 mm continuum data were taken from the vla archive .",
    "the data consist of four sets of observations in the d , c and cnb configurations ( see table [ obs7 mm ] ) .",
    "absolute flux calibration was achieved by observing 3c  286 , and a model image at 7 mm for this calibrator was used to calibrate the data in amplitude . in order to improve the sensitivity of the final image , but keeping a balanced contribution from the different configurations , we have concatenated all the available uv data giving the same weight to the d and c+cnb data .",
    "since these data come from different configurations , it is not possible to average the individual maps . from these uv data we obtained a 7 mm `` all - epochs '' naturally weighted map .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show naturally weighted 3.6 cm maps of vla 2 for each individual epoch .",
    "we have detected radio continuum emission from vla 2 in all the epochs , with total flux densities varying in the range 0.2 - 0.5 mjy . in these maps ,",
    "we see changes in the morphology of vla 2 , but some of the structures persist from one epoch to another . in particular , in three of the epochs vla 2 shows a clear double morphology with two components separated by @xmath00@xmath53 along a p.a . of @xmath0150@xmath9 .",
    "this double morphology appears in the 1998.2 and 1998.4 epochs , where the uv coverage was exactly the same , and in the 2000.9 epoch , which was a full - track observation and therefore the uv coverage obtained was much better than in the other epochs ( see table [ tabla1 ] for the ha ranges and time on source for each epoch of observation ) . in the 1999.5 epoch ,",
    "the uv coverage was also very similar to that of the 1998 epochs , but the double morphology is not so evident .",
    "we think this could be due to the higher rms noise of the 1999.5 map and to the increase of the flux density of the northern component ( see below ) that partially masks the emission of the southern component . given these considerations ,",
    "it is likely that vla 2 is actually a persistent double radio source , with the differences in the observed morphology being mainly due to the different uv coverage from one epoch to another .",

    "this provides a more uniform coverage of the gridded uv plane , resulting in maps having higher angular resolution than naturally weighted maps .",
    "unfortunately , uniform weighting yields lower sensitivity , and due to the weakness of the source , it is difficult to detect it in the uniformly weighted map of a single epoch .",
    "however , it is still possible to test our hypothesis of a double radio source with the available data . for this purpose",
    "we have made uniformly weighted maps from two different sets of concatenated uv data : ( i ) the three epochs in which vla 2 does not show clearly a double morphology , and ( ii ) the three epochs in which vla 2 shows a clear double morphology .",
    "this procedure allows us to compare two maps with high enough angular resolution and sensitivity , as well as a good uv coverage .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] , vla 2 shows always a double morphology ( with a slight change of @xmath00@xmath51 in the position of the sources ) , even in the map made with the data of the epochs in which the double morphology was not evident .",
    "this strongly supports that two radio continuum sources ( that we call vla 2a and vla 2b ) persist through all the epochs , covering a time span @xmath21 5 yr .    since all the data seem to be consistent with the presence of a double source , we obtained an `` all - epochs '' uniformly weighted map ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) by concatenating all the uv data .",
    "the positions and flux densities of components vla 2a and 2b , derived from gaussian ellipsoid fits to this map , are given in table [ tabla2 ] .",
    "the angular separation of the two components is 0@xmath529 , which corresponds to a projected separation of @xmath090 au ( assuming a distance of 300 pc ) .",
    "if these sources were tracing some kind of high - velocity outflowing features , such as knots in a jet , a significant variation in their positions in the single epoch maps would be expected ( e.g. , a velocity of @xmath0100 km s@xmath11 in the plane of the sky would result in an angular displacement of @xmath22 over the period of @xmath05 yr covered by our observations ) .",
    "the lack of a significant displacement from one epoch to another excludes that these sources trace high - velocity material , unless the axis of the motion was very close the line of sight ( which does not seem to be the case , given that the blue and red lobes of the molecular outflow appear clearly separated on the sky ) .",
    "this , together with the additional properties observed for these sources ( see below ) led us to interpret vla 2a and vla 2b as a close binary system of embedded ysos .",
    "the individual epoch maps shown in figure [ fig1 ] suggest variability in the 3.6 cm flux density of the compact components of the double source . in table",
    "[ tabla3 ] we give the peak intensities of vla 2a and vla 2b at each epoch of observation . because the angular resolution of our observations is similar to the angular separation of the two sources , these values of the peak intensity",
    "must be taken with care .",
    "however , given that the maps of the different epochs have been restored with the same beam , the variations of the peak intensities are expected to be representative of the variability of the individual components .",
    "the peak intensity of vla 2b appears to be constant at all epochs , consistent with a value of 0.06 @xmath6 0.01 mjy beam@xmath11 ( see table [ tabla3 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the peak intensity of vla 2a is consistent with a value of 0.07 @xmath6 0.01 mjy beam@xmath11 ( see table [ tabla3 ] ) in the four first epochs , while in the last two epochs the peak intensity of the source increased approximately by a factor of two .",
    "similar flux density variability has been observed in several embedded ysos ( e.g. , cep a , porras et al .",
    "2002 ; b335 , vila et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we interpret the variability in the flux density of vla 2a as due to material recently ejected that still remains very close to the yso and it is not distinguishable from the source .",
    "in addition , we have detected 7 mm emission from vla 2a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the flux densities at 3.6 cm and 7 mm of vla 2a ( see table [ tabla2 ] ) imply a spectral index @xmath23 @xmath8 1.1@xmath60.3 ( s@xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 ) , consistent with partially optically thick free - free emission that could be tracing a radio jet .",
    "the nominal value of the spectral index obtained is slightly higher than the typical values found in ionized jets driven by ysos , 0.3 @xmath27 @xmath23 @xmath27 0.9 ( anglada 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this higher value of the spectral index of vla 2a could be indicating that we are partially missing the extended emission of the possible radio jet , either because of insufficient uv coverage or because part of this extended emission is confused with the emission of the nearby source vla 2b .",
    "since the outer part of a thermal radio jet is where the emission is optically thinner , we would be observing preferentially the emission coming from the region closer to the driving source , where the optical depth is higher .",
    "this effect would increase the value of the spectral index with respect to that of the overall emission of a radio jet .",
    "alternatively , a high value of the spectral index could be indicative of a significant contribution from dust emission at 7 mm .",
    "both possibilities ( free - free emission from a jet with a possible contribution of dust emission from a circumstellar disk or an envelope ) are consistent with vla 2a being a yso .",
    "we should note that the spectral indices derived in this paper have been obtained from non - simultaneous observations and can be affected by time - variability of the sources .",
    "however , as discussed above , the flux variations observed in our multi - epoch observations suggest modest variability that it is not expected to affect our conclusions on the nature of the emission derived from the spectral index .",
    "also , the 3.6 cm and 7 mm observations have different uv coverages , that could introduce additional errors in the flux density measurements of extended emission .",
    "finally , the presence of several sources in a small area makes difficult to isolate the contribution of each source .",
    "therefore , the spectral indices reported in this paper should be considered as rough estimates .",
    "in addition to the compact emission of the two sources vla 2a and vla 2b , in the individual 3.6 cm maps of figure [ fig1 ] we also note the presence of several weak `` knots '' that could be tracing extended emission . in order to gain sensitivity to extended structures",
    ", we have concatenated all the 3.6 cm uv data and made a naturally weighted `` all - epochs '' map , that is shown in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "this map shows extended emission with a p.a . of @xmath0115@xmath9 , where we identify the knots",
    "w1 , w2 , e1 , and e2 , that can also be seen in several of the individual epoch maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the extended emission seems to emanate from vla 2a , the northern component of the double source , since a line running through the major axis of this extended emission is centered close to the position of vla 2a ( see fig .",
    "3b ) , which is the strongest source along this direction . the p.a . of this extended emission ( @xmath0115@xmath9 ) coincides with that of the system of hh objects observed in the region ( lpez et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that vla 2a is a yso that is driving these hh objects . the p.a . of",
    "the extended emission is also similar to that of the symmetry axis of the larger pair of co outflow lobes ( @xmath0100@xmath9 ) , thus suggesting that vla 2a is also associated with this lobe pair .",
    "we interpret the extended radio emission as tracing an ionized jet that originates at the position of vla 2a , and where the knots w1 , w2 , e1 , and e2 would be tracing electron density enhancements produced by shock - ionization .",
    "we do not detect clear proper motions associated with these knots from one epoch to another , setting an upper limit to the proper motion velocity of the knots of @xmath027 km s@xmath11 ( however , due to the coarse temporal sampling and the low signal - to - noise ratio of the knots in the individual epoch maps , they are difficult to identify from one epoch to another , and we can not discard higher proper motion velocities ) .",
    "this suggests that these knots have been excited by the interaction of the jet of vla 2a with dense , stationary clumps in the surrounding gas .",

    "the spectral index of vla 2a in the 3.6 cm to 7 mm wavelength range , is consistent with this source tracing the origin of an ionized radio jet with a possible contribution from dust .",
    "therefore , we conclude that vla 2a is an embedded yso associated with a radio jet ; it is also the likely exciting source of the system of hh objects and of the larger pair of lobes of the co outflow observed in the region .",
    "we identify several knots ( w1 , w2 , e1 , and e2 ) distributed along the extended 3.6 cm emission , at both sides of vla 2a .",
    "since these knots are much weaker than vla 2a and are aligned along the axis of the extended emission we interpret them as tracing electron density enhancements in the jet from vla 2a rather than tracing the location of other ysos .",
    "the lack of clear proper motions suggests that these knots have been excited by the interaction of the jet with dense , stationary clumps in the gas surrounding vla 2a .",
    "the compact source vla 2b has a flux density comparable to that of vla 2a and both sources are aligned along a p.a .",

    ". therefore , these sources are good targets for future observations with the evla and alma .",
    "we also detect in the single epoch images two faint knots ( n1 and s1 ) nearly aligned with the source vla 2b along a p.a . of @xmath020@xmath9 , that is similar to the p.a . of the smaller pair of co outflow lobes .",
    "we tentatively interpret these two knots as shock - ionized gas associated with episodic ejections from vla 2b , that could be the driving source of these knots as well as of this pair of co outflow lobes .",
    "in addition to vla 2a , our 7 mm image ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) shows emission from other two sources .",
    "one of them , that we will refer to as vla 2c , coincides with the position of the water maser emission detected by girart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and furuya et al .",
    "the coincidence of this source with the water maser suggests that vla 2c is a yso . at 7 mm , the source vla",

    "@xmath8 @xmath28 . at 3.6 cm ,",
    "we detect weak extended emission that coincides with the source detected at 7 mm .",
    "the 3.6 cm emission shows two peaks , that we call vla 2ca and vla 2cb . with the current data it is unclear if these two peaks actually correspond to two objects or to a single extended source .",
    "sensitive high angular resolution multiwavelength observations would be required to further define the nature of this emission . from the total flux density at 3.6 cm ( vla 2ca @xmath14 vla 2cb ) and 7 mm ( see table [ tabla2 ] ) , we estimate a spectral index of 1.5@xmath60.4 for vla 2c , a value suggestive of thermal emission from a yso ( see discussion in  3.1 ) .",
    "the third 7 mm source , vla 2d , is located @xmath29 from vla 2a and does not have a detected 3.6 cm counterpart . however , this source is located within @xmath00@xmath56 of the nominal position of a 1.35 mm source detected by girart et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with the submillimeter array ( sma ) ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "given that the beam size of the sma observations is 3@xmath53@xmath131@xmath55 ( p.a.=79@xmath9 ) , we suggest that vla 2d is the 7 mm counterpart of the 1.35 mm source . from the total flux density at 7 mm of vla 2d , and adopting a 4@xmath30 upper limit to the 3.6 cm flux density , we estimate a lower limit to the spectral index of this source of @xmath02.0 in this wavelength range , suggesting that the 7 mm emission is dominated by thermal dust emission .",
    "additionally , the 1.35 mm source seems to be associated with an elongated sio structure , probably tracing material shocked by a high velocity flow ( girart et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggesting that this source is associated with a yso .",
    "in addition to the sources vla  2a , vla 2b , vla 2c , and vla 2d that appear located at the center of the l723 outflow , our 3.6 cm images detect the source vla 1 , first reported by anglada et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and located @xmath015@xmath1 sw of the position of vla 2a .",
    "the source vla 1 appears always compact ( deconvolved size @xmath31 ; see table [ tabla4 ] ) with a roughly constant flux density consistent at all epochs with a value of 0.36@xmath60.02 mjy ( see table [ tabla4 ] ) .",
    "we have not detected this source at 7 mm up to a 4@xmath30 level of 0.32 mjy . with our 3.6 cm flux density and the 7 mm upper limit",
    ", we estimate for vla 1 a spectral index @xmath320.1 , a value consistent with the spectral index @xmath23=@xmath120.3@xmath60.2 measured by anglada et al .",
    "( 1996 ) between 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "as discussed by anglada et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and girart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this source is most probably a radio - emitting , optically - obscured t tauri star located very near to the denser part of the molecular cloud .",
    "our accurate astrometry indicates that this compact source does not show noticeable proper motions , with a position displacement @xmath33 ( 3@xmath30 ) over the 5.3 yr period covered by our observations ( see table [ tabla4 ] ) .",
    "since a total proper motion displacement of @xmath34 is expected for an object embedded in the l723 cloud ( assuming a distance of 300 pc and the brand & blitz 1993 model of galactic rotation ) , this result is compatible with vla 1 belonging to the l723 cloud .",
    "however , the possibility that vla 1 is a line - of - sight source not directly associated with the molecular cloud is not discarded .",
    "the remaining radio sources ( vla 2a , vla 2b , vla 2c , and vla 2d ) discussed in this paper are embedded in regions of extended radio emission and are associated with ejecta , which does not allow a precise determination of their possible proper motions .      in the maps of avery",
    "et al . ( 1990 ) , the l723 co outflow shows a four - lobe morphology with a large pair of bipolar lobes along a p.a . of @xmath17 and",
    "a smaller pair of bipolar lobes along a p.a . of @xmath35 . as discussed in the previous sections , our radio continuum data suggest that a multiple system of at least four ysos is present , within a region of @xmath36 au , at the intersection of the axes of symmetry of the two pairs of co lobes .",
    "furthermore , in  3.1 we discussed the results that led us to propose that vla 2a is related to the excitation of the larger pair of co lobes , while vla 2b could be driving the smaller pair of co lobes .    nevertheless , the interferometric maps of lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( obtained with higher angular resolution than the maps of avery et al .",
    "1990 ) reveal additional details of the co outflow structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",

    "@xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the larger pair of co lobes appears clumpy , with only a few weak co emission knots near the symmetry axis of this lobe pair ( at p.a .",
    "@xmath38 ) , and most of the emission concentrated at both sides of this central axis , roughly at p.a . @xmath39 and p.a .",
    "the distribution of the co emission of this larger lobe pair was interpreted by lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as tracing the limb - brightened cavity walls of a bipolar outflow with a p.a .",
    "@xmath38 . however , we note that the distribution of the co emission at both sides of the central axis ( p.a .",
    "@xmath38 ) of this lobe pair is asymmetric .",
    "the emission at p.a .",
    "@xmath41 starts at the center of the outflow ( the position of vla 2 ) and is stronger than the emission at p.a .",
    "@xmath39 , which shows a gap , with the bulk of the emission apparently starting @xmath42 away from the outflow center .",
    "furthermore , the p.a . of @xmath43 coincides with that of the extended radio emission associated with vla 2a and with that of the system of hh objects .",
    "these considerations led us to propose a new interpretation of the high - velocity co emission in l723 in terms of three bipolar outflows . one bipolar outflow at p.a .",
    "@xmath37 , that could be driven by vla 2b . a second bipolar outflow at p.a .",
    "@xmath40 , which is associated with a system of hh objects and shock - ionized extended radio continuum emission with the same position angle , that is driven by vla 2a .",

    "the lobes of the proposed outflows at p.a . @xmath37 and p.a .",
    "@xmath40 appear well `` connected '' with the outflow center , suggesting recent outflow activity in these directions .",
    "on the contrary , the lobes of the outflow at p.a .",
    "@xmath39 are weaker and well detached from the central region , suggesting that they resulted from activity taking place in the past . therefore , we speculate that this outflow at p.a .",
    "@xmath8 90@xmath9 could be a `` fossil '' outflow in the sense that its exciting source has not been active in the recent past .",
    "the motion observed will then be the result of momentum conservation of the gas accelerated when the exciting source was active .",
    "a similar fossil molecular outflow has been proposed to exist in the molecular cloud b5 ( yu , billawala , & bally 1999 ) .",
    "our high angular resolution 3.6 cm and 7 mm continuum observations towards the previously known source vla 2 , at the center of the l723 multipolar co outflow , have revealed a group of at least four ysos within a region of @xmath44 ( 1200 au ) in size .",
    "the size of this region is comparable with the size of the region where girart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a local heating of the high density gas .",
    "two of our continuum sources , vla 2a and vla 2b , form a close radio binary whose components are separated by @xmath00@xmath529 ( @xmath0 90  au ) .",
    "another source , vla 2c , is associated with a water maser , and a fourth source , vla 2d , that we only detect at 7 mm , appears to be the counterpart of a recently discovered 1.35 mm source .",
    "we propose that the multipolar co outflow in l723 could result from the superposition of at least three independent bipolar outflows with position angles of @xmath0115@xmath9 , @xmath090@xmath9 , and @xmath030@xmath9 , driven by three different ysos .",
    "our 3.6 cm observations suggest that vla 2a is associated with an ionized jet at a position angle of @xmath0115@xmath45 .",
    "we propose that this is the exciting source of the system of hh objects previously detected in the region , as well as of a bipolar co outflow with the same position angle .",
    "the presence of two 3.6 cm knots aligned with vla 2b at a p.a . of @xmath020@xmath9 suggests that vla 2b could be the exciting source of the bipolar co outflow at a p.a of @xmath030@xmath9 .",
