    "[ cor : chi non - zero ] suppose @xmath2 has finite dimensional rational homology and that @xmath126 is a rationally cyclic map . if @xmath238 , then @xmath239    from theorem  [ thm : induced on even cohomology ] , the image of @xmath49 in even degrees is decomposable , and hence non - spherical .",
    "thus @xmath240 is zero in even degrees . since @xmath238 ,",
    "the splitting of theorem  [ thm : spherical on cohomology ] can not occur with @xmath194 odd  recall that @xmath241 .",
    "therefore , by that result , @xmath240 is zero in odd - degrees , as well .",
    "in particular , we see that under the hypotheses of corollary  [ cor : chi non - zero ] , the homomorphism induced by @xmath44 on rational homology is zero if all homology of @xmath242 is spherical .",
    "thus , the corollary , or better , theorem  [ thm : spherical on cohomology ] , gives a satisfactory generalization to cyclic maps of gottlieb s result concerning odd - degree gottlieb groups .    from the above results",
    ", we can also extend the main result of @xcite , at least in the simply connected case . in the original ,",
    "very strong hypotheses are placed on @xmath2 , namely that both @xmath243 and @xmath244 are finitely generated .",
    "if , in addition , we have @xmath238 and @xmath13 a co-@xmath38-space , then it is shown that a cyclic map @xmath14 obtains @xmath245 an element of finite order in @xmath246 $ ] .",
    "recall that a _",
    "rational co-@xmath38-space _ is a space @xmath13 such that @xmath247 is a co-@xmath38-space .",
    "recall that a _ ( rationally ) elliptic space _ is one whose rational homology and rational homotopy are both finite dimensional .",
    "a result of halperin @xcite states that the euler characteristic of a rationally elliptic space is non - negative .",
    "further , that in the case of positive euler characteristic , that is , in the non - zero case , the rational cohomology is zero in odd degrees . for brevity , we refer to an elliptic space with positive euler characteristic as an _",
    "@xmath248-space_. there are many interesting examples of such spaces , including even dimensional spheres , complex projective spaces , and  maximal rank pair \" homogeneous spaces @xmath249 . products of @xmath248-spaces , and more generally many total spaces of fibrations in which base and fibre are @xmath248-spaces , are again @xmath248-spaces .",
    "we can relax lim s hypotheses as follows :    let @xmath13 be a rational co-@xmath38-space with finite dimensional rational homology and let @xmath2 be an @xmath248-space . then any rationally cyclic map @xmath126 has rationally trivial suspension , @xmath250 . if @xmath13 is assumed finite dimensional , then the subgroup of cyclic maps @xmath251 $ ] is a finite group .",
    "since cup products in @xmath252 are trivial and @xmath253 is evenly graded we can apply theorem  [ thm : induced on even cohomology ] to obtain @xmath254 .",
    "it follows that @xmath255 , and hence that @xmath256 .",
    "the assertion about finiteness follows from lemma  [ lem : finiteness ] .",
    "we give several examples of rationally cyclic maps .",
    "our first examples illustrate that most results from the previous section are sharp .",
    "we then give some complete calculations of the set @xmath257    since our results tend towards restricting the possibilities for rationally cyclic maps , we begin with an example that indicates rich possibilities for such remain .",
    "of course , since any map into an odd - dimensional sphere and any rational gottlieb element are rationally cyclic maps , we already have many examples .",
    "consider the map @xmath258 , obtained by composing the quotient map @xmath259 with the hopf map @xmath260 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath44 is not rationally trivial , although it induces the trivial homomorphism on both rational homotopy and rational cohomology . since @xmath261 is an @xmath38-space , @xmath44 itself , and not just its rationalization , factors through an @xmath38-space .",
    "actually , the rationalization of @xmath178 is a rational gottlieb element in @xmath262 , and so @xmath44 is a rationally cyclic map by theorem  [ thm : cyclic composition ] .",
    "this shows that we need @xmath138 in theorem  [ thm : odd rationally trivial ] , even though the map may be trivial on cohomology .",
    "this example suggests many others of the form @xmath263 , with the second map a rational gottlieb element .",
    "the image of @xmath49 need not be decomposable in odd degrees , as we now illustrate . take @xmath264 with the @xmath265-cell attached by the iterated whitehead product @xmath266 \\in \\pi_4(s^2 \\vee s^2)$ ] .",
    "then all cup products in @xmath267 are trivial , with @xmath268 non - spherical .",
    "now the quotient map @xmath269 is a map into a rational @xmath38-space , and is therefore a rationally cyclic map . in degree",
    "@xmath265 , @xmath49 has indecomposable , non - spherical image .",
    "inclusion of the bottom cell @xmath270 is a map into an @xmath38-space , and hence is a cyclic map .",
    "evidently , we have @xmath271 and yet @xmath44 is not rationally trivial  it is not trivial on rational cohomology , in fact .",
    "this shows that we need the hypothesis of finite rational category on @xmath2 in theorem  [ thm : odd rationally trivial ] .",
    "it also shows that without @xmath186 , then a cyclic map @xmath14 may have @xmath187 non - zero in even degrees .",
    "indeed , here we have @xmath272 .",
    "this example illustrates the splitting of theorem  [ thm : spherical on cohomology ] for the case @xmath273 .    for some spaces @xmath2 , including the @xmath248-spaces mentioned above , the rational gottlieb groups of @xmath2 coincide with the odd rational homotopy groups of @xmath2 . in certain cases",
    ", this may generalize to a bijection @xmath274 for any space @xmath13 .",
    "we now give some examples .",
    "if @xmath2 is an odd dimensional sphere @xmath275 then @xmath276 is an @xmath38-space and therefore @xmath277 = h^{2n+1}(a ; \\pi_{2n+1}(s^{2n+1 } ) \\otimes \\q ) = h^{2n+1}(a;\\q)$ ] .",
    "when @xmath278 the same result holds but the calculation is slightly more involved .",
    "the following example includes the cases in which @xmath2 is an even dimensional sphere or a complex projective space .",
    "suppose @xmath2 has rational cohomology algebra a truncated polynomial algebra on a single generator of even degree @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath279/(x^{k+1})$ ] , then @xmath280 .",
    "we argue as follows : first , @xmath2 has minimal model @xmath281 with @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 .",
    "suppose @xmath14 is a rationally cyclic map with minimal model @xmath286 given on generators by @xmath287 and @xmath288 , for @xmath289 .",
    "now consider an affiliated map @xmath16 for @xmath44 .",
    "then by taking into account the relative degrees of @xmath155 and @xmath159 , we can write its minimal model @xmath290 on generators as @xmath291 and @xmath292 , for @xmath293 . since @xmath294 is a dg map",
    ", we can equate the terms that occur in @xmath295 with those that occur in @xmath296 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath297 .",
    "now define a dg homotopy @xmath298 on generators by setting @xmath299 and @xmath300 this is easily checked to commute with the differentials , and so defines a dg homotopy that starts at @xmath301 and ends at a map that is zero on the even - degree generator @xmath155 .",
    "so far , we have argued that a cyclic map @xmath14 has minimal model given on generators by @xmath302 and @xmath288 , up to homotopy . for a map of this form , @xmath303 must be a cycle in @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , two such maps are dg homotopic exactly when the cycles that @xmath159 is sent to by each represent the same cohomology class of @xmath304 .",
    "this latter assertion is easily justified using the approach of @xcite , for instance .",
    "suppose @xmath305 where @xmath306 is a compact , connected lie group and @xmath307 is a maximal torus",
    ". then @xmath308 for any space @xmath13 . for in this case the minimal model of @xmath2 is of the form @xmath309 with @xmath310 and the @xmath311 of odd degree with @xmath312 a decomposable polynomial in the @xmath313 .",
    "the rational cohomology of @xmath2 is evenly graded and the cycles @xmath313 correspond to a space of generators",
    ". see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.15.16 and ex.2,p.448 ) for justification of these assertions . by theorem  [ thm : induced on even cohomology ] , if @xmath36 is rationally cyclic , then @xmath314 since @xmath315 can not contain non - zero decomposable terms .",
    "thus the minimal model @xmath316 of @xmath44 satisfies @xmath317 and @xmath318 for cycles @xmath319 and the result follows as above .",
