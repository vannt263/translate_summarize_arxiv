    "the existence of glueballs and their experimental detection remains a challenge , although proposed already three decades ago @xcite . nevertheless , there are candidates in the scalar spectrum which have not yet been uniquely identified and thus may be interpreted as glueballs or hybrid states .",
    "the question of the existence of glueballs is of particular interest for an understanding of heavy ion collision signatures , because they may play a crucial role in the possible formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "such a phase transition may involve the lightest possible glueball candidate with quantum numbers @xmath4 and mass around @xmath5 gev @xcite . some of the contributions to the phase transition are possibly states known from hadron spectroscopy , however , it might also be necessary to include color octet contributions .",
    "spectroscopy so far supplies a less vague physical picture , hence we adopt a rather conservative point of view and investigate the possible role of the @xmath4 ( and @xmath6 ) glueball state in heavy ion collision scenarios .",
    "the present work is a first step in this direction , where we present a model dependent description of two glueball states and their interaction in order to investigate the question whether glueball - glueball interaction is a candidate for a significant contribution in heavy ion reactions .",
    "although technical difficulties still trouble our understanding of glueball properties in experiments , largely because glueball states can mix strongly with nearby @xmath1 resonances @xcite , recent experimental and lattice studies of @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 glueballs seem to be convergent @xcite-@xcite . on theoretical grounds , a simple potential model with massive constituent gluons , namely the model of cornwall and soni @xcite has received attention recently @xcite for spectroscopic calculations . in particular , one important issue , in this model , is the determination of the lowest mass glueball : the @xmath7 resonance , which within the model is assumed to a have a mass @xmath9 gev .",
    "experimentally this resonance is now closely identified with the scalar meson @xmath10 observed at belle in @xmath11 @xcite and bes in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this resonance is an isospin zero state so that in principal it should be a mixture of the quark sector @xmath1 with a color singlet of glue @xcite .",
    "in particular there is growing evidence in the direction of large @xmath13 content with some mixture with the glue sector .    in the present work we consider two extreme possibilities for the @xmath7 resonance : ( _ i _ ) as a glueball , calculating the scattering amplitude and cross - section for a glueball - glueball interaction , in the context of the constituent gluon model , with gluon interchange ; ( _ ii _ ) as a pure @xmath13 system , where a new calculation is performed for the scattering amplitude and cross - section for an @xmath14-@xmath14 interaction , in the context of a quark interchange picture .",
    "however , it is not very likely that exclusively either one or the other scenario is present in the scattering process .",
    "then for _ s_-wave scattering the cross section may be compared to experimental data by a likelihood analysis , for instance . to this end",
    "we treat glueball - glueball and ( @xmath13)-(@xmath13 ) interaction on the same theoretical footing : in order to obtain a scattering amplitude and cross - section with constituent interchange , we follow the fock - tani formalism ( ftf ) approach @xcite .",
    "this formalism is a mapping technique in which composite particles are mapped into ideal particles ( with no sub - structure ) .",
    "the ftf shall be briefly described in the following section applied to glueballs , the case for a heavy ( @xmath1)-(@xmath1 ) system is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in the fock - tani representation one starts with the fock representation of the system using field operators of elementary constituents which satisfy canonical ( anti-)commutation relations .",
    "composite - particle field operators are linear combinations of the elementary - particle operators and do not generally satisfy canonical ( anti)commutation relations .",
    " ideal \" field operators acting on an enlarged fock space are then introduced in close correspondence with the composite ones .",
    "the enlarged fock space is a graded direct product of the original fock space and an  ideal state space \" .",
    "the ideal operators correspond to particles with the same quantum numbers of the composites ; however , they satisfy by definition canonical ( anti)commutation relations .",
    "next , a given unitary transformation , which transforms the single composite states into single ideal states , is introduced .",
    "when the transformation acts on operators in the subspace of the enlarged fock space which contains no ideal particles , the transformed operators explicitly express the interactions of composites and constituents .",
    "application of the unitary operator on the microscopic hamiltonian , or on other hermitian operators expressed in terms of the elementary constituent field operators , gives equivalent operators which contain the ideal field operators .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the new representation is hermitian and has a clear physical interpretation in terms of the processes it describes .",
    "since all field operators in the new representation satisfy canonical ( anti)commutation relations , the standard methods of quantum field theory can then be readily applied .",
    "the starting point in the present calculation is the definition , in second quantization , of the glueball creation operator formed by two constituent gluons g_^=_^ a_^a_^.
