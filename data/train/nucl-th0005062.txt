    "it is tedious to have to refit parameters for every new interaction .",
    "a direct way to utilize existing non - relativistic interactions , without refitting the interaction , is preferable .",
    "two methods exist that can be used to directly formulate relativistic models based on realistic non - relativistic interactions .",
    "historically the first of these methods was introduced by coester , pieper , and serduke @xcite @xcite@xcite . in their construction",
    "an interaction is added to the square of the non - interacting mass operator .",
    "the interaction is chosen so the dynamical equations are equivalent to the non - relativistic equations .",
    "the result is that the eigenfunctions of the relativistic model can be trivially obtained from those of the corresponding non - relativistic model .",
    "the second method was introduced by kamada and glckle @xcite .",
    "this utilizes an @xmath0-matrix preserving unitary transformation , called a scattering equivalence @xcite@xcite@xcite , that relates the two operators in ( [ eq : rocco ] ) .",
    "the transformation involves a simple rescaling and a renormalization that ensures unitarity .",
    "both methods lead to invariant @xmath0-matrices that are identical to the non - relativistic @xmath0-matrix .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the difference between the mass - squared method and the kamada - glckle method by comparing both the two - body dynamics and elastic electron - deuteron scattering , which is the simplest three - body reaction .",
    "the surprising conclusion of our analysis is that even though both methods give the same invariant scattering matrix as the corresponding non - relativistic model , they do not lead to identical predictions , even at the two - body level .",
    "specifically , these two methods do not lead to scattering equivalent theories .",
    "we also consider differences in the predictions for elastic electron - deuteron form factors based on these two models . while normally a change in the two - body interaction would lead to a corresponding change in the strong current , in typical calculations the consistency of the dynamics and the strong current",
    "is normally limited to ensuring current conservation and current covariance .",
    "the comparisons in this paper are limited to understanding the quantitative sensitivity of the physical observables to the two different models of the two - body dynamics , keeping everything else the same .",
    "specifically we compare the calculated observables using the deuteron eigenstates constructed from the mass - squared and kamada - glckle methods based on the same realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction . in both calculations",
    "the current is treated in an identical impulse - like approximation , using identical nucleon form factors and an identical form of the dynamics .",
    "it is impossible to rigorously determine if the difference in these three - body observables are differences that would arise if the two methods were two - body scattering equivalent , or if they are due to the violations of the scattering equivalence .",
    "however , the result of the above comparison is that there are small but measurable differences in the two predictions .",
    "the parameter that controls the scale of these differences is the same one that controls the scale of the violation of the scattering equivalence .    for the electron - scattering calculations the coupling to the electron",

    "the conventional interpretation of this observation is that the physical predictions of a quantum theory do not depend on the choice of hilbert space basis .",
    "there is a more subtle interpretation of this result that is best understood in the context of scattering theory .",
    "the s - matrix measures the difference between the free and interacting hamiltonian that can be observed asymptotically .",
    "scattering observables are preserved under unitary transformations provided the same unitary transformation is used to transform both the free and interacting hamiltonians .",
    "a class of unitary transformations , called scattering equivalences , have the property that if they are applied to the full hamiltonian _ without _ applying them to the free hamiltonian , they give the same scattering matrix elements and bound state observables as the original hamiltonian .",
    "they are not meant to transform representations of free particles . in this sense",
    "they have a different interpretation than a standard unitary transformation .",
    "they parameterize the insensitivity of the asymptotic @xmath0-matrix observables to certain short - range features of the interactions .",

    "be determined up to an overall scattering equivalence .",
    "the ambiguity in the choice of representation of the interaction is particularly confusing in the case of relativistic models , where there are many scattering equivalent ways to interpret a given non - relativistic interaction .",
    "for example , the kernel of a single two - body interaction defines different operators in each of dirac s @xcite forms of the dynamics .",
    "the operators differ by whether they commute with the total linear momentum , the total four velocity , or the light - front components of the four momentum .",

    "they can be made to have the same three - body observables by introducing additional three - body interactions@xcite .",

    "the key to resolving this problem was originally noted by breit @xcite .",
    "he correctly pointed out that the laboratory cross section is a lorentz invariant function of a lorentz invariant variable , the laboratory energy .",

    "`` non - relativistic '' potentials are determined by adjusting the parameters of the potential until the scattering eigenstates of h= k^2 m + v reproduce the experimentally measured @xmath38 .",
    "the analysis of the mass - squared method in equation ( [ eq : cx ] ) shows that the non - relativistic and relativistic formulas for the cross section lead to the same invariant quantity when @xmath21 is identified with the asymptotic relative momentum in the center of momentum frame .    if this same data were used to determine the kamada - glckle interaction , it would be appropriate to determine the interaction @xmath39 directly by comparing to the lorentz invariant cross section as a function of @xmath21 , as was done by schiavilla @xcite .",
    "the identification ( [ eq : kin ] ) defines @xmath22 by q^2=m(2 -2 m ) rather than by @xmath31 .",
    "this would lead to a `` non - relativistic '' model with a different high @xmath22 behavior .    in the case of the kamada - glckle method , because the measured invariant cross section is given as a function of @xmath40 rather than @xmath34 , the fitting should be done as a function of @xmath21 , as in the mass - squared method , with the corresponding @xmath22 dependence determined by the identification q^2 = m(2 - 2m)= m(2 - 2 m ) .",
    "this suggests that a kamada - glckle interaction constructed from a non - relativistic model fit to the @xmath0-matrix as a function of laboratory energy will not be consistent with experiment at high energies .",

    "there are questions about the interpretation of non - relativistic models .",
    "although the wave functions in the two models are not observable , they are shifted in the same manner as the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the rescaling and renormalization of the wave function is responsible for all of the differences in our computations of the electron scattering observables .",
    "the result is that the kamada - glckle wave functions will be spread out more in momentum space than the mass - squared deuteron wave functions .",
    "the factor @xmath41 in ( [ eq : kinb ] ) defines the scale of the shift of the @xmath0-matrix or wave function at a given value of @xmath8 that results from the two different interpretations of the @xmath8 variables .",

    "this is seen in the plots of the @xmath43 and @xmath44-state wave deuteron wave functions in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the reduced @xmath43-state wave function and figure 2 shows the reduced @xmath44-state wave function .",
    "the solid line in both figures corresponds to the mass - squared model while the dashed line corresponds to the kamada - glckle model .",
    "both figures show the predicted shift of the kamada - glckle wave function to the right of the mass - squared wave function .",
    "the shift is due to the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath22 in ( [ eq : kinc ] ) rather than due to the factor @xmath25 , which is a compensating factor that simply ensures that the change of variables is unitary . because this shift is minimal when @xmath45 , the two wave functions look similar for momenta out to about @xmath46@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "@xmath21 is identified as a relativistic relative momentum while in the kamada - glckle method the relativistic and non - relativistic rest energies are identified .",

    "<S> we investigate the difference between those relativistic models based on interpreting a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction as a perturbation of the square of a relativistic mass operator and those models that use the method of kamada and glckle to construct an equivalent interaction to add to the relativistic mass operator . </S>",
    "<S> although both models reproduce the phase shifts and binding energy of the corresponding non - relativistic model , they are not scattering equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the example of elastic electron - deuteron scattering in the one - photon - exchange approximation is used to study the sensitivity of three - body observables to these choices . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that the differences in the predictions of the two models can be understood in terms of the different ways in which the relativistic and non - relativistic @xmath0-matrices are related . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the mass squared method is consistent with conventional procedures used to fit the lorentz - invariant cross section as a function of the laboratory energy . </S>"
