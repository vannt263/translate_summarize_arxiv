    "the discovery of `` hidden '' broad - line regions ( blrs ) in several seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite has generated much interest in unified theories , in which the viewing orientation explains many of the observed differences between type 1 and 2 seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "such theories posit that , in both types of seyfert galaxy , a luminous central source ( presumably an accreting supermassive blackhole ) is surrounded by a equatorial distribution of matter in the form of either a swollen accretion disk or a molecular torus @xcite .",
    "a type 1 nucleus is then observed only if the viewing direction is sufficiently close to the axis of the system so as to fall within the opening angle of the putative torus .",
    "more inclined lines of sight necessarily intercept the disk / torus material in which case we see an `` obscured '' type 2 system .",
    "however , a caveat is that a small fraction of the nuclear flux can be scattered into our line of sight by highly ionized material filling the `` hole '' of the torus , thus explaining the detection of broad optical lines in polarized light and also weak uv and soft x - ray emission even in seyfert 2s where our direct view of the nucleus is completely blocked .    x - ray measurements of intrinsic column densities of @xmath7 @xmath2 in many seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite lend support to the above unification picture . for column densities @xmath8 @xmath2",
    ", x - rays can penetrate the torus leading to the detection of an absorbed power - law continuum together with a iron k@xmath3 fluorescence line at 6.4  kev .",
    "however for column densities @xmath9 @xmath2 , even hard x - radiation is seen only indirectly via scattering ( as in compton - thick seyfert 2s such as ngc 1068 ) .",
    "x - rays may be electron scattered by highly ionized matter extending along the axis of the system or compton reflected by almost neutral material located at the inner edge of the torus . in either case , the scattering material is exposed to the intense nuclear flux and may produce significant line emission and , in circumstances where the direct continuum is completely blocked leaving only a baseline of the much weaker scattered continuum , such lines can have very high equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices found in seyfert galaxies are distributed around a single value of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the best explanation for this is that mildly relativistic thermal electrons or highly relativistic non - thermal electrons compton scatter uv photons into the x - ray energy range ( e.g. svensson 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the rollover seen in x - ray data above 100 kev has focussed most attention on thermal models @xcite .",
    "a popular scenario is the two - phase disk - corona model , in which a hot x - ray corona is located above a cold uv emitting accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the uv seed photons for compton cooling of the energetic electrons are produced from reprocessing of the hard x - ray spectrum in the accretion disk . with complete feedback ,",
    "the approximate equipartition between the soft disk and hard x - ray luminosities leads naturally to @xmath11 for a wide range of optical depths ( see also stern et al .",
    "however , for sources with spectra flatter than @xmath10 , the disk - corona model of @xcite must be modified so that some of the soft seed photons escape without being intercepted by the corona , thus making for harder spectra as fewer photons are available for compton scattering @xcite .",
    "x - ray variability studies of seyfert 2 nuclei can provide important clues to the processes by which x - rays are produced as well as to the geometry of the circumnuclear matter .",
    "however , variability has been reported in only a few objects .",
    "one example is mrk 3 , where the hard x - ray emission decreased by a factor of two during a period of 3.6 years @xcite .",
    "recent observations with _",
    "rxte _ have shown variability to exist on time - scales of weeks @xcite .",
    "the shape of the spectrum suggests that _ all _ of the variability can be attributed to changes in the direct nuclear flux @xcite",
    ". short term variability ( on time - scales of hours ) has been detected in only one object , ngc 4945 @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that a parsec scale , geometrically thick molecular torus can not be responsible for the bulk of the x - ray absorption @xcite .",
    "spectral variability has also been claimed in a couple of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "for example , the absorption column in ngc 7582 increased by @xmath12 @xmath2 between _ asca _ observations taken two years apart @xcite .",
    "a similar variation in the absorber was suggested by @xcite , based on a comparison between _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , and _ ginga _ observations .",
    "more recent observations with _",
    "bepposax _ of this particular galaxy have shown that the absorber may have a complex spatial structure with a large column density ( @xmath13 @xmath2 ) covering 60% of hard x - ray continuum , and a smaller , but variable column completely covering the source @xcite . as a further example , in ngc 7172 , the spectral index of the power law continuum decreased by @xmath14 between _ ginga _ and _ asca _ observations taken almost 4 years apart @xcite .",
    "these authors attribute the decrease to an intrinsic change in the spectral index although , given the narrow bandpass of _ asca _ , it is possible that the spectrum is affected by a complex absorber and/or compton reflection .",
    "the launch of the _ rxte _ satellite is conducive to the systematic study of variability in seyfert 2 galaxies , because of the large effective area and broad band coverage afforded by the detectors , and the flexible scheduling allowed by the mission .",
    "we have conducted a six month monitoring campaign with _",
    "rxte _ of a few seyfert 2 galaxies previously observed by the _ ginga _ and _ asca _ satellites .",
    "the results of our observations of mrk 3 have been reported elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we present our results on mrk 348 .",
    "mrk  348 is a nearby ( @xmath15 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) seyfert 2 galaxy for which there is evidence of a broad ( fwhm @xmath16 km  s@xmath17 ) h@xmath3 line component in polarized light @xcite . in terms of current unification schemes for seyfert galaxies",
    "( see above ) this can be taken as clear evidence for the presence of an obscured seyfert 1 nucleus , confirmation of which was provided by the _",
    "detection of an absorbed ( @xmath18 @xmath2 ) hard x - ray source ( with @xmath19 ) coincident with this galaxy @xcite .",
    "this heavy obscuration in the nucleus of mrk 348 may also be responsible for the bi - canonical nature of its ionizing continuum @xcite .",
    "there was marginal evidence in the _ ginga _ spectrum for an iron k@xmath3 emission line at 6.4 kev of equivalent width @xmath20 ev .",
    "an iron k@xmath3 emission line of equivalent width @xmath21 ev was subsequently detected with _",
    "asca _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to iron k@xmath3 , _ asca _ detected a prominent s xiv ",
    "xv line of large equivalent width ( @xmath22 ev ) .",
    "a weak power law continuum was detected at soft x - ray energies in observations made with the _ rosat _ position sensitivity proportional counter ( pspc ) ( @xmath23 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "1993 ) and _ asca _ ( @xmath24 ; netzer et al .",
    "it is most likely that this weak soft x - ray emission is dominated by electron - scattered nuclear flux , with perhaps some contribution from spatially extended thermal emission from a hot wind ( e.g. krolik & vrtilek 1984 ) .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity measured in the _ ginga _ observation was @xmath25 erg s@xmath17 ( @xmath26 ) , which is roughly a factor 3 higher than that subsequently recorded by _ asca_.",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite made twelve separate observations of mrk  348 during the period december 29 , 1996 to july 12 , 1997 , with the intervals between the observations arranged so that the x - ray variability would be sampled on timescales of days , weeks , and months ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the observation durations were typically in the range 25005000 seconds .",
    "the instruments on board _ rxte _ are the proportional counter array ( pca ; glasser , odell & seufert 1994 ) , the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; gruber et al .",
    "1996 ) and the all - sky monitor ( asm ; levine et al .",
    "however , in this paper we consider only the pca data , since mrk  348 was not detected by the other instruments .",
    "the pca consists of five sealed proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a total collecting area of @xmath27  @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the main detector volume of each pcu contains a 90% xenon plus 10% methane gas mixture , and three main layers of anode wires , connected in such a way that two chains of events are produced per layer @xcite .",
    "the detectors are sensitive to x - rays in the 260  kev range , and have an energy resolution equal to @xmath29 ( fwhm ) at 6  kev .",
    "the field of view of each pcu is restricted to @xmath30 ( fwhm ) by a hexagonal , beryllium copper collimator @xcite .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the latest version of the ftools software ( version 4.2 ) together with the standard-2 data files .",
    "the standard-2 mode data are the most useful when analysing relatively faint sources , since spectra with full layer identification are accumulated every 16  seconds from `` good '' xenon events ( i.e. those which survive background rejection ) . for every standard-2 mode data file , a background file",
    "is generated using pcabackest and the `` l7_240 '' faint source model files .",
    "the internal background is correlated with the `` l7 '' rate , which is the sum of the seven two - fold coincidence rates present in the standard-2 mode data files .",
    "most of the internal background can be estimated by matching conditions in the standard-2 files to those in the `` l7 '' model file .",
    "however , there is a residual background component associated with activation induced in the spacecraft as it passes through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) . in estimating the background due to activation , which has a half - life of 240 minutes , the hexte particle monitor rate is integrated , with an exponential decay term , over the most recent saa passages .",
    "this integrated rate is then multiplied with the activation spectrum in the `` 240 '' model file to give the total activation component .",
    "light curves and spectra were extracted from both the standard-2 mode and background data file , using the standard data selection criteria for faint sources . only front layer light curves and spectra are considered , as these data have the largest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the background dominates above @xmath31 , so data above this energy are not considered further , and the low energy cut - off for pca data is 2  kev .",
    "pcu3 and pcu4 are occasionally switched off because residue collects on the anodes , so increasing the electric field causing discharge , and therefore the analysis is restricted to data from the first 3  pcus .",
    "deadtime corrections were not applied , because the correction is very small ( @xmath32 ) even when the count rate per pcu reaches @xmath33 .",
    "the individual response matrices for pcu0 , pcu1 , and pcu2 are co - added prior to spectral fitting .",
    "the background - subtracted count rates measured in the 26  kev band ( where the flux is significantly affected by absorption ) , 610  kev band ( where the underlying power - law probably dominates the flux ) , and 1020  kev band ( where compton reflection may become important ) are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . in all three energy ranges",
    ", variability becomes apparent in the second half of the monitoring period and is most evident towards the very end of the campaign .",
    "specifically , the count rate doubles over a period as short as 20  days .",
    "the rms variability , after correcting for uncertainties in the background modeldasmith / systematics_000222/systematics_000222.html ] , amounts to 61 , 48 , and 42% for the 26 , 610 and 1020  kev bands respectively .",
    "the strong correlation between the signal in the three bands suggests that a single , broad - band spectral component may be responsible for much of the observed variability .",
    "the spectral changes implied by the decline in the variability amplitude with energy might result from spectral variations in this component or , alternatively , indicate the presence of two or more spectral components with different temporal behaviour .",
    "further illustration of the x - ray spectral variability is provided by the light curves of the 1020  kev/610  kev and 610  kev/26  kev hardness ratios , denoted hr1 and hr2 respectively , both of which show a spectral softening as the source intensity increases ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , individual spectra with similar hardness ratio values were combined ( i.e. , observations 1 & 2 ; 3 & 4 ; 5 & 6 ; 7 , 8 & 9 ; 10 & 11 ; 12 ) to give a total of six spectral datasets as input to the spectral fitting analysis , which is based on the xspec v10.0 software package @xcite .",
    "above 25 kev , where no signal is expected from mrk 348 in the front layer , the observed count rates are within 1% of the predicted background count rate . however , below 6 kev , where the mid- and bottom - layer counts rates should be close to the background level , a small deficit is observed in three spectra , which can be removed by decreasing the background by @xmath34% .",
    "hence , the systematic error in the background is considered to be @xmath34% in three of the six datasets , and @xmath35% elsewhere .",
    "following @xcite , an estimate of the uncertainties due to the systematic error in the background can be obtained by altering the normalization of the background spectrum by @xmath36% or @xmath37% .",
    "these are shown as additional errors on the spectral parameters .",
    "fluctuations in the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) are also a significant source of uncertainty in the pca spectra of faint sources . based on results obtained with the _ ginga _ large area counter instrument ,",
    "the @xmath38 fluctuation spectrum is best described by a power - law of energy index @xmath39 and normalization @xmath40 photons @xmath2 sec@xmath17 kev@xmath17 @xcite . hence in our analysis of the x - ray spectrum of mrk 348 ,",
    "a fluctuation spectrum was included as a separate model component , thus allowing the data themselves to constrain the level of the fluctuation required .",
    "this technique was , for example , previously used by @xcite in their analysis of _ ginga _ seyfert  2 spectra .    as a starting point in the spectral analysis",
    "all six spectra were fitted by model consisting of a power - law continuum ( photon spectral index @xmath41 ) absorbed by an intrinsic column density ( @xmath42 ) , where the atomic cross - sections and abundances for the latter were taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we also included a narrow ( @xmath43  kev ) gaussian emission line to represent the iron k@xmath3 emission .",
    "initially , only the power - law normalization was allowed to vary across the six spectra with the line energy fixed at @xmath44  kev , the value for neutral iron .",
    "this model ( model  1 ) provides an unacceptable fit with @xmath45 for @xmath46 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , the best - fitting parameters being @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xmath2 ( the errors , here and elsewhere in this paper , are 90% confidence for one interesting parameter , @xmath49 ) . given the spectral variability evident in the data ( see section  [ sec - timing ] ) , it is not surprising that this model rather poorly describes the observed spectra .",
    "the next step was to allow either the column density ( model 2 ) or the photon index ( model 3 ) to vary across the six spectra .",
    "the variable column density description provides an excellent fit , with @xmath50 and @xmath42 in the range ( @xmath51 to @xmath52 ) @xmath53 @xmath2 ( @xmath54 , 297 d.o.f . ) .",
    "consistent with the observed hardness ratio variations , the column density falls as the power - law normalization ( and hence the intrinsic flux ) increases .",
    "the variable index model provides a worse fit , but nevertheless one which is still excellent , with @xmath41 in the range @xmath55 to @xmath56 and @xmath57  @xmath2 ( @xmath58 , 297 d.o.f . ) . in this case",
    "there is a strong correlation between photon index and intrinsic flux , with a steeper spectral index being preferred in the brighter source states ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] for details of both model 2 and model 3 spectral fitting results ) .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity measured in the _ rxte _ observations was ( @xmath59@xmath60 ) @xmath61 ergs s@xmath17 ( @xmath26 ) , which implies a peak intensity a factor 3 higher than that recorded by _",
    "ginga_.    in the variable column density description ( model 2 ) , the _ unabsorbed _ iron k@xmath3 emission line flux was @xmath62 photon s@xmath17 @xmath2 , yielding an equivalent width , with respect to the _ absorbed _ continuum , in the range 40170 ev .",
    "this is consistent with the emission line fluxes determined from earlier _ ginga _",
    "( @xmath63 photon s@xmath17 @xmath2 ; smith & done 1996 ) and _ asca _ ( @xmath64 photon s@xmath17 @xmath2 ; netzer , turner & george 1998 ) observations , although the uncertainties in the individual measurements are rather large . assuming a spherical distribution of gas , the equivalent width expected from the measured column density would be in the range 40130 ev @xcite , comparable to that observed .",
    "we note that the best - fit line energy is @xmath65 kev , which is below that expected for cold iron .",
    "however , we suspect this discrepancy is due to uncertainties in the instrument response around the xe l edge at @xmath66 kev .",
    "finally , if the line normalization is allowed to vary between the six spectra , the reduction in @xmath67 is @xmath6 , which is not statistically significant ( on the basis of the f - test for five additional free parameters ; bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "although this lack of line variability is intriguing , the rather large uncertainties in the individual measurements and coarse sampling do not exclude the possibility that the line flux tracks the continuum on timescales as short as hours , as would be expected if most of the line was produced in a putative accretion disk .",
    "while the spectra fits confirm the presence of spectral variability , the origin of the changes in either column density and/or photon index variations is not distinguishable .",
    "therefore , as an additional test , the data were separated into two spectra on the basis of the flux change that occurred during the latter part of the monitoring campaign .",
    "thus , data from the first six observations were combined into a `` low state '' spectrum , while data from the last six spectra comprise a `` high state '' spectrum .",
    "these two spectra were then fitted to a spectral model in which _ both _ the column density and photon index were allowed to vary .",
    "the projected confidence regions in the @xmath41@xmath42 plane for this model are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "although photon index variations can not be excluded , a significant change in the column density is required by the data .",
    "hereafter we take the view that , on the basis of these very simple spectral models , the spectral variability is best assigned largely to variations in the column density .",
    "although the above absorbed power - law model provides an excellent fit to the combined _ rxte _ datasets , we next consider what constraints , if any , may be placed on slightly more sophisticated spectral descriptions , such as models including either a compton reflection component or a partially covered source .",
    "specifically we considered the possibility that some of the observed spectral variability may arise due to the presence of an extra component with a delayed temporal response relative to the direct continuum .",
    "if the disk - corona model described in  1 is correct , then a significant fraction of the hard x - ray flux should be reprocessed in the accretion disk .",
    "the anticipated spectral signatures from such reprocessing includes an iron k@xmath3 fluorescence line and compton reflection of the hard continuum @xcite .",
    "these features have previously been identified in many seyfert galaxies , and may also be present in the spectrum of mrk 348 .",
    "motivated by this prediction , the data were fitted to a model consisting of an absorbed power - law continuum with _ absorbed _",
    "compton reflection from neutral , solar abundant material , as implemented in the pexrav model @xcite plus a narrow gaussian line representing iron k@xmath3 emission ( model 4 ) .",
    "the inclination ( to our line of sight ) of the reflecting material was fixed at the default value ( @xmath68 ) , since the reflection spectrum below 20 kev is relatively independent of the inclination angle .",
    "the shape of the incident continuum above 20 kev is important , even when considering measurements below this energy because of the effects of compton down - scattering ; the power - law continuum was therefore exponentially cut - off with an e - folding energy of 150 kev , similar to that observed in other seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the reflected spectrum should track the continuum on timescales of weeks or less , if it originates in the putative disk .",
    "therefore , the relative normalization between the direct and reflected continuum was initially tied to a single value for all six spectra ( a value of @xmath69  @xmath70 is expected from a flat @xmath71 geometry and isotropic emission ) .",
    "in this case the best - fitting parameter values are @xmath72 , @xmath73  @xmath74 and @xmath42 in the range ( @xmath75 to @xmath76 ) @xmath53 @xmath2 ( @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ; see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "this model provides a significantly ( @xmath79% ) better fit to the data ( on the basis of a f - test for one additional free parameter ) , than our earlier preferred model ( model 2 ) .",
    "the iron k@xmath3 emission line flux was @xmath80 photons s@xmath17 @xmath2 , which yields an equivalent width in the range 40120 ev , compared with the @xmath81 ev equivalent width expected from the reflection continuum @xcite .",
    "thus , for the brighter source states , reflection could produce all of the observed line emission . when the relative strength of the reflection continuum is allowed to vary between the observations , there is a strong correlation between its strength and the intensity of the source , with a stronger reflection continuum being preferred for the weaker source states .",
    "however , the reduction in @xmath67 of @xmath82 is insignificant ( on the basis of a f - test for six additional free parameters ) and , therefore , we can not draw any firm conclusions .",
    "if the molecular torus is optically thick , then compton reflection originating at the ( far - side ) inner walls of the torus may be seen directly , rather than through the gas column responsible for the low energy absorption ( depending , of course , on the torus geometry and view angle ) .",
    "such reflection would not be expected to vary on timescales shorter than about a year , and could in principle lead to a net softening of the spectrum as the source intensity increases .",
    "such reflection could also contribute significantly to a non - varying component of the iron k@xmath3 emission line . to test this possibility",
    ", the data were fitted to a model including an absorbed power - law continuum , an _ unabsorbed and non - variable _ compton reflection component , and a narrow gaussian emission line ( model 5 ) .",
    "the compton reflection spectrum was the same as that used for model 4 .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath83 and @xmath42 in the range ( @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) @xmath86 @xmath2 ( @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ; see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the improvement in @xmath67 over that for the variable absorber model is significant at @xmath79% ( on the basis of a f - test for one additional term ) .",
    "the relative normalization between the direct and reflected continua varies from @xmath73  @xmath89 to @xmath73  @xmath90 as the level of the former changes .",
    "the iron k@xmath3 emission line flux was @xmath91 photons s@xmath17 @xmath2 , and yields an equivalent width in the range 30120 ev , comparable to the 30100 ev range expected from reflection continuum alone .",
    "recently , evidence has emerged for compton - thick material which partially , or fully covers the central nucleus in several seyfert 2 galaxies ( ngc 4945 , iwasawa et al .",

    ", the data were fitted to a model consisting of a power - law continuum , which is partially covered by a constant column ( @xmath92 ) , and fully covered by a variable absorber ( @xmath93 ) , plus a narrow gaussian emission line ( model 6 ) .",
    "this model provides the best fit so far to the data , with @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xmath2 covering @xmath96 of the source , and @xmath93 in the range ( @xmath97 to @xmath98 ) @xmath53 @xmath2 ( @xmath99 ; @xmath100 ; see table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "the iron k@xmath3 line equivalent width expected from an obscuring column of @xmath101 @xmath2 would be @xmath102  ev @xcite with respect to the absorbed continuum , but only @xmath4  ev with respect to the unabsorbed continuum , and so would remain largely undetected in these data , given the small covering fraction .",
    "we note also , that the best - fit photon index is @xmath103 , which is close to that found in other seyfert nuclei @xcite .",
    "one issue that needs to be addressed is whether confusing sources within the @xmath30 field of view of the pca could have contributed to the flux and spectral variability noted above .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc image of the mrk 348 field shows many faint soft x - ray sources in the vicinity of the seyfert 2 galaxy , but none are bright enough to be of any concern in the present analysis ( except perhaps in the very unlikely event that one of these sources brightened by an order of magnitude during the rxte observations ) .",
    "we note that the liner 1.9 galaxy , ngc 266 @xcite , is situated at a similar redshift ( @xmath104 ; ho et al .",
    "1997b ) as mrk 348 and @xmath105 from it ( at which point the pca collimator transmission is roughly 50% of the on - axis value ; zhang et al . 1993 ) .",

    "furthermore , assuming the h@xmath3/hard x - ray correlation of @xcite holds for ngc 266 , its broad h@xmath3 line emission of @xmath107 ergs s@xmath17 @xcite implies a 210 kev ( unabsorbed ) luminosity of order @xmath108 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "this again suggests that the contribution of ngc 266 to the hard x - ray flux measured by _",
    "rxte _ is negligible ( @xmath109 ergs s@xmath17 @xmath2 in the 210 kev band ) . in summary",
    "we believe that it is very unlikely that the current x - ray spectral variability measurements for mrk 348 are significantly contaminated by confusing sources in the _ rxte _ field of view .",
    "the shortest timescale on which x - ray continuum variations are observed in mrk 348 is @xmath110  day , the minimum spacing between observations . in terms of the light - travel time",
    "this implies a maximum source size of @xmath111  cm , although in reality the x - ray emitting region may be much smaller than this , ( i.e. @xmath112  cm if the x - rays are produced within 10  schwarzchild radii of a @xmath113 black hole ) .",
    "in contrast variations in the intrinsic column density ( along the line of sight to the nucleus of mrk 348 ) take place over periods of typically weeks to months with the largest change , @xmath114  @xmath2 , occurring on a timescale of @xmath115 days .",
    "if the observed column changes are interpreted as due to the motion , across the line of sight , of clouds of gaseous material in orbit around the central black - hole , then for a transverse cloud velocity of @xmath116  km  s@xmath17 ( characteristic of extreme blr cloud velocities ) , the predicted timescale for the column change is @xmath117  days , which is roughly consistent with the observations .",
    "such clouds are located at a distance of @xmath118  cm , where @xmath119 is the black - hole mass in units of @xmath113 .",
    "we can infer the ionization of the cloud material via the ionization parameter @xmath120 , where @xmath121 . here",
    "@xmath122 is the ionizing luminosity ( measured between 13.6  ev to 13.6  kev ; kallman & mccray 1982 ) , @xmath123 is the gas density and @xmath124 is the distance to the clouds from the continuum source . for an ionizing luminosity of @xmath125  erg  s@xmath17 and @xmath126  @xmath127 ( a typical value for blr clouds ) ,",
    "the ionization parameter is @xmath128 .",
    "this is consistent with a lightly ionized state for the iron in the clouds ( i.e. below fexv ) , but in agreement with the iron k@xmath3 emission - line ( and k - edge ) requirements .",
    "however for a typical cloud column density of @xmath114  @xmath2 , the implied physical thickness , is only @xmath129 cm .",
    "since this dimension is much smaller than the inferred x - ray source size @xmath130 , the organisation of clouds into a coherent sheet - like distribution is required in order to explain the large amplitude @xmath42 variations which are observed in mrk 348 and other sources ( e.g. yaqoob et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "alternatively , the increase in the source luminosity may be sufficient to induce the observed decline in the column density via photo - ionization .",
    "however , the lack of evidence for highly ionized iron in mrk 348 would require a fairly narrow regime for the ionization parameter . such a scenario could be investigated using photo - ionization codes such as xstar , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .    within the measurement constraints , the iron k@xmath3 line flux remained at a roughly constant level throughout the monitoring campaign .",
    "this implies that much of the line emission is produced in material reasonably distant from the nucleus .",
    "a possible location for this material is in the patchy cloud distribution responsible for the highly variable intrinsic absorption in this source .",
    "the lack of significant changes in the line flux then requires both the sky coverage and typical thickness of the cloud layer , as viewed from the nucleus , to remain fairly constant ( a requirement which need not , of course , conflict with the fact that temporal variations are observed along our specific line of sight ) .",
    "it is also possible that a contribution to the line emission comes from the illumination of the ( far - side ) inner walls of the putative molecular torus ( assuming at least some element of the gaseous medium surrounding the x - ray source is thomson thick ) .",
    "while compton reflection is not specifically required by the spectral fitting , the data are consistent with the reflection expected from a torus subtending a solid angle at the source of @xmath131@xmath59 .",
    "if the ionization cones are collimated by the torus , then the observed half - opening angle of the cones , of @xmath132 @xcite , corresponds to a torus solid angle of order @xmath133 .",
    "thus , in principle the bulk of the line emission could originate in this way . in this setting ,",
    "the fact that mrk 348 is not observed as a compton - thick seyfert 2 is presumably the result of our line of sight to the nucleus passing across the top of the torus thus avoiding its most optically thick regions .",
    "finally , we note that the iron k@xmath3 emission observed in the x - ray spectra of many seyfert  1 galaxies is most naturally associated with reflection from the inner regions of an accretion disk .",
    "one signature of such emission is the broadening of the line due to relativistic effects close to the central massive black - hole ( e.g. tanaka et al . 1995 ) . also , depending on the geometry and optical depth of the x - ray emitting plasma , variations in the line flux on timescales of a week or less are predicted .",
    "the current observations provide no evidence for such an origin for the iron k@xmath3 emission observed in mrk 348 .",
    "also an earlier _ asca _ observation of mrk 348 was unable to determine whether the iron k@xmath3 emission line was significantly broadened @xcite .",
    "clearly further observations with much higher signal - to - noise and energy resolution will be needed in order to test for the presence of an accretion disk in mrk 348 .",
