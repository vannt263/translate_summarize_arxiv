    "coherent backscattering ( cbs ) of light is a dazzling example of interference phenomena surviving a disorder average in multiply scattering media @xcite .",
    "it occurs generally when shining light onto an optically thick , disordered sample , provided that the wave s phase coherence remains preserved over many scattering events . in this so - called `` mesoscopic regime '' , interference effects lead to a complicated speckle pattern of the wave intensity scattered into different directions .",
    "this pattern can be seen as a fingerprint of the specific disorder realization .",
    "when averaging over the disorder , however , most of the speckles are washed out .",
    "the only interference peak non - sensitive to disorder is the one in exact backscattering direction .",
    "it originates from constructive interference between waves interacting with the same scatterers , but in opposite order , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) . in the ideal case of perfectly constructive two - wave interference ,",
    "the peak - to - background ratio of backscattered intensities , known as the enhancement factor @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig:1](a ) ) , equals exactly two , whereas @xmath1 if decoherence or dephasing effects are present .",
    "cbs clearly shows that , in general , wave propagation in disordered media can not be fully described by a simple diffusion equation . in the case of weak disorder",
    ", an approximate diffusion model can nevertheless be maintained , provided that the enhanced backscattering effect is accounted for by a reduction of the diffusion constant ( weak localization ) .",
    "for strong disorder , i.e. , if the mean free path becomes comparable to the wave length , interference between reversed paths can even lead to a complete absence of diffusion ( strong localization ) @xcite . a promising candidate for reaching the strong disorder regime experimentally , is the scattering of light by cold atoms , which exhibit an extremely large resonant cross section .    since the first experimental observation of cbs from cold atoms in 1999 @xcite ,",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental activities have been devoted to elucidating relevant dephasing mechanisms , such as raman scattering on the degenerate atomic transitions @xcite , the influence of a magnetic field @xcite , thermal motion of atoms @xcite , and nonlinear response of saturated dipole transitions @xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed on two atomic species , rubidium ( rb ) @xcite and strontium ( sr ) @xcite .    in the present mini - review ,",
    "we focus on the impact of inelastic scattering from strongly driven , saturated atomic dipole transitions on cbs . understanding this dephasing mechanism , induced by quantum mechanical frequency fluctuations of the scattered photons , is important for the transition from weak to strong localization , which is expected to occur at increased atomic densities , when atoms exchange multiple photons , and even a single photon is able to saturate the atomic transition @xcite .",
    "apart from its fundamental interest , controlling this phase - breaking mechanism is crucial for more technological applications such as random lasers @xcite .    .",
    "( c ) in this paper , we examine the fundamental case of two strongly laser driven atoms .",
    "frequency fluctuations due to inelastic scattering break the symmetry between the reversed paths ( @xmath2 ) , leading to dephasing and reduction of the coherent backscattering peak .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "considering a system of only two atoms suffices to grasp the essential physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "this relatively simple theoretical model describes an optically thin atomic medium , where double scattering provides the dominant contribution to the cbs signal @xcite .",
    "it is in this double scattering regime that a cbs reduction due to the saturation of atomic dipole transitions was first observed @xcite .",
    "our two - atom model system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the sum of the atomic hamiltonians describing the electronic dipole transitions of identical , motionless atoms at random positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the distance @xmath7 much greater than the optical resonance wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "the atomic internal structure corresponds to the transition @xmath9 , precisely as in the sr experiment @xcite .",
    "the atoms are coupled to the quantized photon field bath @xmath10 .",
    "the atom - field interaction @xmath11 leads to the radiative linewidth @xmath12 of the atomic excited level .",
    "this interaction also permits the two atoms to exchange resonant photons which implies a far - field dipole - dipole coupling of order @xmath13 .",
    "since we are considering the weak localization regime @xmath14 , the small coupling @xmath15 implies that atoms exchange only single photons with each other .",
    "however , the atoms are exposed to an external driving laser field with wavevector @xmath16 and frequency @xmath17 , the coupling being described by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "two important parameters describe the atom - laser interaction : the detuning @xmath18 from the optical resonance at transition frequency @xmath19 , and the rabi frequency @xmath20 describing the dipole coupling strength .",
    "the effective laser intensity is conveniently described @xcite by the saturation parameter @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , the atoms scatter photons elastically , while @xmath23 indicates the onset of inelastic scattering , where the frequency of the scattered photons is different from the laser frequency .",
    "a quantity of primary interest is the cbs enhancement factor @xmath0 measuring the phase coherence between counter - propagating waves : @xmath24 it is the total cbs intensity , measured at backscattering @xmath25 , divided by the total background intensity @xmath26 measured away from the backward direction , the index `` 2 '' indicating the double scattering contribution .",
    "the radiated field amplitude is proportional to the electric dipole of the emitting atom @xcite .",
    "the scattered intensities , i.e. , background @xmath27 and interference @xmath28 contributions , can therefore be expressed via certain dipole correlation functions and excited state populations , respectively , of the two atomic cbs transition .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](c ) shows one example of the nonlinear inelastic scattering processes , induced by a powerful laser field , contributing to the cbs interference @xmath28 .",
    "note that the intermediate photon frequencies of the counter - propagating processes are , in general , different from each other , leading to the violation of the reciprocity symmetry between the reversed paths , and hence to a decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) , we have derived @xcite the two - atom master equation governing the evolution of arbitrary two - atom observables .",
    "thus , cbs intensities and , hence , the enhancement factor can be found by solving the master equations and performing a configuration average of the results over the probability distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in many cases ,",
    "analytical solutions are found , while general results are accessible from numerical solutions . in the following",
    ", we will report results for the helicity preserving polarization channel , referring the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more general cases .",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath27 can be decomposed into elastic and inelastic components , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the elastic parts @xmath31 ( the equality holds thanks to reciprocity ) , the inelastic background @xmath32 and interference term @xmath33 ( right @xmath34 axis ) , as well as the enhancement factor @xmath0 ( left @xmath34 axis ) , all as function of the saturation @xmath35 for two different detunings : ( a ) on - resonance @xmath36 and ( b ) @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig:2](a ) decreases linearly with small @xmath35 , in qualitative agreement with the experiment @xcite . in the highly saturated regime @xmath41 ,",
    "the elastic intensity is negligible , yet the limit value @xmath42 larger than unity demonstrates the residual ( self-)interference of inelastically scattered photons @xcite .",
    "in the case of far - detuned driving shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , an enhancement @xmath43 _ smaller _ than unity around @xmath44 implies the presence of cbs anti - enhancement @xcite , due to the destructive interference with @xmath45 of the inelastic photons ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a similar effect in a different situation ) .",
    "the general condition for cbs anti - enhancement in the saturation regime can be formulated as @xmath46 , which corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "also in the far - detuned case , @xmath0 tends to a limit value as @xmath40 , which is larger than unity but smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "the results shown in sec .  [ subsec:1 ] clearly demonstrate that inelastic photons do contribute to the cbs interference .",
    "it is therefore interesting to resolve the spectral characteristics of the background and interference contributions . in other words , instead of measuring the total intensities defining @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we wish to detect the backscattered light by a narrowband detector tuned to a frequency @xmath48 .",
    "such a set - up , completely in the spirit of fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) , enables one to probe the elementary scattering processes contributing to the cbs signal at the frequency @xmath48 . by varying @xmath48 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a more detailed characterization of the inelastic processes having impact on the cbs signal in the saturation regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we present the cbs spectrum in the limit of well separated spectral lines of the single - atom resonance fluorescence spectrum ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "these results were calculated ( analytically for exact on - resonance , and numerically for detuned driving ) with the same master equation approach in combination with the quantum regression theorem @xcite .    .",
    "( a ) @xmath36 ; ( b ) @xmath37 .",
    "the numbers near the resonances indicate their areas , such that the overall areas of the background and interference terms give unity and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to ( a ) @xmath51 ; ( b ) @xmath52.,width=453 ]    in the limit @xmath49 , the elastic intensity vanishes , and the cbs spectrum is purely inelastic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . both the background and interference spectra consist of seven resonances .",
    "the resonances of the background spectra are lorentzians with positive weights , defining areas of the respective peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . as for the interference contribution ,",
    "its spectrum represents a combination of the lorentzian peaks with positive and negative weights as well as dispersive resonances .",
    "the total areas of the interference resonances , @xmath53 for @xmath36 and @xmath54 for @xmath37 , allow to deduce the values of the cbs enhancement factor , @xmath55 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the number and positions of the cbs spectral peaks can be understood within a dressed - state analysis of the atomic laser - driven and cbs transitions ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we assume a right circular polarization of the laser field driving the @xmath56 transition of both atoms .",
    "then , observing cbs in the helicity preserving channel corresponds to detecting photons emitted from the latexmath:[$|1\\rangle\\leftrightarrow     , @xmath17 , and @xmath58 .",
    "apart from these , one needs to take into account photons with frequencies @xmath59 , indicated by the two downward arrows in the plot of the mollow triplet .",
    "the photons emitted by atom 1 ( wiggly arrows with indicated frequencies ) propagate to atom 2 ( bottom ) , where they are ( re-)scattered from either of the dressed states @xmath60 , @xmath61 , finally giving rise to seven different peaks in the two - atom spectrum ( fig .  [ fig:3]).,width=453 ]",
    "the interaction of the atoms with the powerful laser field leads to the formation of dressed states @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of photons in the laser mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , top center ) .",
    "spontaneous transitions from the dressed - state manifold @xmath64 to @xmath65 give a resonance fluorescence spectrum with three peaks centered at @xmath66 , @xmath17 , and @xmath58 , which is known as the mollow triplet @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , top right ) .",
    "photons emitted by one atom are re - scattered on the cbs transition of the other atom .",
    "the level @xmath67 of the latter transition is not affected by the laser laser field . however , the @xmath68 transition is modified by the laser field , because it shares the common level @xmath69 with the laser - driven transition . therefore , the internal structure of the cbs transition is such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](bottom ) : it has one excited state and two ground state sublevels separated by @xmath20 .",
    "correspondingly , the new resonance frequencies of the cbs transition are @xmath59 .",
    "when the mollow triplet emitted by one atom is incident on another atom , it is scattered on the internal structure of the latter .",
    "the relevant scattering processes that can take place are depicted on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "each photon can be scattered either elastically or undergo raman - stokes or -anti - stokes ( multiphoton ) transitions ( which lead to a frequency change by @xmath70 or @xmath20 , respectively ) , which conserve energy and angular momentum .",
    "it follows that the cbs spectrum must have resonances at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the diagrams describing the emission of cbs photons at these frequencies are the three left - most diagrams on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . the right - most diagram in fig.[fig:4](bottom )",
    "depicts resonant scattering of photons with frequencies @xmath59 , which leads to an additional doublet  the autler - townes doublet @xcite  in the cbs spectrum .",
    "the above analysis can straightforwardly be extended to the general case @xmath74 .",
    "again , the background and interference spectra both consist of seven resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) ) which represent : ( i ) a ( re-)scattered mollow triplet @xcite at @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , ( ii ) an autler - townes doublet @xcite at @xmath77 , and ( iii ) a doublet at @xmath78 originating from raman - stokes and anti - stokes scattering of the mollow triplet sidebands .",
    "whether the interference of amplitudes at a certain frequency is constructive or destructive is determined by their relative frequency - dependent phase shifts @xcite .",
    "the interference is purely constructive around @xmath73 and @xmath79 , whereas it changes its character around the dispersive resonance peaks of the autler - townes doublet .",
    "finally , the interference can be destructive for one or both of the mollow sidebands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . at @xmath80 ,",
    "these destructive interferences can outweigh the constructive ones in the sum over all spectral contributions , resulting in cbs anti - enhancement for the total intensity .",
    "we have studied the impact of inelastic processes on cbs within a simple quantum optical model involving two atoms exposed to a strong laser field . within our master - equation approach",
    ", we can calculate the loss of cbs interference for all values of saturation and detuning , including an analysis of the spectral components .",
    "a dressed - state picture permits to understand the position and character of resonance peaks that constitute the background and interference signals .    including higher scattering orders as well as addressing propagation effects in bulk atomic clouds is hard within this framework , due to the exponential growth of the hilbert space with the number of scatterers .",
    "a promising direction of future research is to unify the presently discussed master - equation description of atom - photon interaction with the diagrammatic scattering approach that has been developed for nonlinear classical scatterers @xcite .",
    "further challenging problems include a quantitative explanation of the cbs experiment in the saturation regime with internally degenerate rb atoms @xcite , the assessment of quantum statistical properties of the backscattered field , and , ultimately , the exploration of the strong localization regime @xmath81 .",
    "this loss of interference visibility can be traced back to the availability of which - path information encoded in inelastically scattered photons @xcite ; see also the similar situation for thermal motion @xcite and internal degeneracy @xcite ."
