    "the metallicities were lower in the heads by factors of 3 to 10 @xcite .",
    "we interpret these metallicity drops as the result of recent accretion of metal - poor gas onto part of an otherwise quiescent dwarf galaxy .",
    "idealized simulations @xcite as well as cosmological simulations of galaxy formation @xcite show this effect .",
    "a recent review of accretion - fed star formation is discussed in @xcite .",
    "support for this interpretation comes from the locations of most of the xmps in low - density environments , such as voids and sheets in the distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are surrounded by low - metallicity , often - asymmetric hi @xcite , which could be the accreting gas reservoir .",
    "motion through this reservoir could cause the accretion and promote star formation on the leading edge of the dwarf , as might have happened for 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "high - mass late - type galaxies could also be bursting with star formation in their outer parts from episodic accretion @xcite .",
    "one of the best examples of a metallicity drop is in the bright star - forming head of the local tadpole galaxy kiso 5639 , which is the focus of the present paper .",
    "here we examine hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) multiwavelength images of kiso 5639 to determine the masses and ages of the clusters and large - scale star - forming clumps , and to search for evidence of accretion on the periphery .",

    "we placed the galaxy near the edge of the detector to put it close to the read - out to minimize charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) degradation effects , and adjusted its position with the f225w and f336w filters to avoid a bright star .",
    "the wfc3/uvis instrument has degraded over time due to radiation damage , reducing the cte , which results in smeared images along the read - out direction when not corrected @xcite .",
    "the science images are therefore cte corrected using code provided by stsci .",
    "however , the dark calibrations also suffer from this degradation , and therefore we required special calibration files to mask all the hot pixels , and remove a background gradient and splotchy pattern in the science images .",
    "to do so , we created custom super - darks following the method described in @xcite , which use all cte corrected post - flash darks from an anneal cycle to determine the average dark level per good pixel , and mark all hot pixels on shorter timescales with a uniform threshold .",

    "throughputs for the uvis filters were from the wfc3 website .",
    "the chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) and a metallicity of 0.2 solar were assumed .",

    "the rms noise from observations is much less than the rms variation from model to model .",
    "the region masses were determined from the models for each case also , scaling the theoretical magnitude in f438w to the observed magnitude and using the masses tabulated for each population and age by @xcite .",
    "we then picked as reasonable solutions those with the lowest @xmath31 , and among those took the averages of the masses , ages , extinctions and decay times using a weighting function of @xmath32 .",
    "the metallicity measurements of kiso 5639 by @xcite are 0.1 solar for the head and 0.2 solar for the tail , so the tabulated bruzual models with a metallicity of 0.2 solar ( z=0.004 ) are reasonable .",
    "to determine how important metallicity was , solutions for the individual clusters were also found for solar and 0.4 solar metallicities .",

    "star - forming regions in galaxies generally follow a hierarchical size distribution @xcite .",
    "to check the size distribution of the star - forming regions in kiso 5639 , we used the iraf task _ gauss _ to gaussian blur the f336w image by five successive factors of two .",
    "then the program sextractor was used to identify and count sources in each of these gauss - blurred images .",

    "the assumption of a circular disk for the whole galaxy is reasonable considering axial ratios for one - clump galaxies in the kiso sample of uv bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "if tadpoles are highly inclined disk galaxies , there should be face - on versions of tadpoles that have one dominant star - forming clump in a round disk .",
    "kiso galaxies labeled as i , c and i , g are galaxies identified as having one or several main clumps .",
    "there are 159 of these galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which we examined to select one - clump galaxies .",
    "some galaxies in these lists were clearly spiral or interacting , and were excluded .",
    "of the remainder , 48 had one main clump , and 44 had several main clumps ; some of the one - clump dominant galaxies were in the i , g category .    a histogram of the isophotal axial ratios for the 48 one - clump galaxies is shown in figure [ clumphist ] .",
    "the distribution is fairly flat over most of the range , except for a spike at an axial ratio of 0.35 .",

    "for example , the galaxy i zw 18 is an apparent tadpole composed of one large clump of star formation in a main body with a smaller one to the south in the same old - stellar envelope , and a third clump to the north , somewhat detached ; it appears to be intrinsically elongated .",
    "the drop - off in the distribution of axial ratios below 0.2 in the figure is presumably the ratio of disk thickness to diameter .",
    "small galaxies like this tend to be relatively thick @xcite .",

    "the h@xmath2 luminosity of a core rectangular region centered on the head is @xmath111 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "this h@xmath2 luminosity is determined from the continuum - subtracted f657n h@xmath2 image , which comes from the h@xmath2 filter width , @xmath112 , multiplied by the difference between the f657n intensity and the f547 m intensity used for the continuum , and then multiplied by @xmath113 ( see footnote 6 above ) . for reference ,",

    "assuming the conversion in equation ( 2 ) of @xcite , the head luminosity from hst h@xmath2 corresponds to a sfr of @xmath116 yr@xmath5 , which gives the log value of @xmath117 in table 2 .",
    "the sfr determined from the ratio of the head region s photometric mass to its photometric age , @xmath118 yr@xmath5 , is much larger than the h@xmath2 rate .",
    "one reason for this may be that the photometric ages are too young compared to the overall duration of star formation in the region",
    ". this could be the result of a dominance by the youngest massive stars in the ultraviolet bands , or from patchy dust that preferentially obscures older stars .",
    "there could also be a component of h@xmath2 that is obscured or too extended to see in our data .",
    "extinction has an important effect on the inferred photometric sfr .",
    "higher extinction requires more stellar mass to give the same brightness , and a younger age to give the same color , and the combined effect pushes up the sfr . varying the extinction in our models from 0 to 1 magnitude in the visible band increases the total photometric sfr for the 21 clusters in the head from @xmath119 yr@xmath5 to @xmath120 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the average cluster value in table 2 , @xmath121 per cluster , corresponds to a total for all 21 clusters of @xmath122 yr@xmath5 , in the middle of this range and consistent with the average extinction that we find for these clusters , which is 0.65 mag .",
    "we do not derive the sfr based solely on the fuv flux because that method needs to assume a star formation history , such as a constant rate . in",
    "what follows , we use the sfr from the h@xmath2 .    for typical recombination in a photoionized region , the lyman continuum",
    "photon ionization rate , @xmath123 , in photons s@xmath5 , is proportional to the h@xmath2 luminosity in erg s@xmath5 according to the conversion @xmath124 , again using equation ( 2 ) in @xcite .",
    "this implies the ionization rate is @xmath125 photons s@xmath5 . for an ionization rate from an o9 star of @xmath126 s@xmath5 @xcite ,",
    "the head of kiso 5639 contains @xmath6 o9 stars .",
    "the summed mass of the 21 measured clusters in the head region is @xmath127 . considering a chabrier imf in the 0.2 solar metallicity models by @xcite",
    ", such a mass of young stars at 1 myr age would be expected to have an ionization rate of @xmath128 s@xmath5 ; at 3 and 10 myr , that would be @xmath129 and @xmath130 times @xmath131 s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the rate for the 1 myr age is about 30% of what we observe .",
    "alternatively , we can integrate an imf that is flat below @xmath132 and a power law with the salpeter slope of @xmath133 above @xmath132 to @xmath134 , and normalize it to the same total cluster mass .",
