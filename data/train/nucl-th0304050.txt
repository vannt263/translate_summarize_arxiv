    "this contribution provides an overview of one particular means by which a quantitative and intuitive understanding of strong interaction phenomena can be attained .",
    "the broad framework is that of continuum strong qcd , by which i mean the continuum nonperturbative methods and models that can address these phenomena , especially those where a direct connection with qcd can be established , in one true limit or another .",
    "naturally , everyone has a favourite tool and , in this connection , the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) are mine @xcite .",
    "the framework is appropriate here because the last decade has seen a renaissance in its phenomenological application , with studies of phenomena as apparently unconnected as low - energy @xmath0 scattering , @xmath1 decays and the equation of state for a quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dses promise a single structure applicable to the gamut of strong interaction observables .",
    "dyson - schwinger equations provide a nonperturbative means of analysing a quantum field theory .",
    "derived from a theory s euclidean space generating functional , they are an enumerable infinity of coupled integral equations whose solutions are the @xmath2-point schwinger functions ( euclidean green functions ) , which are the same matrix elements estimated in numerical simulations of lattice - qcd . in theories with elementary fermions ,",
    "the simplest of the dses is the _ gap _ equation , which is basic to studying dynamical symmetry breaking in systems as disparate as ferromagnets , superconductors and qcd .",
    "the gap equation is a good example because it is familiar and has all the properties that characterise each dse .",
    "its solution is a @xmath3-point function ( the fermion propagator ) but its kernel involves higher @xmath2-point functions ; e.g. , in a gauge theory , the kernel is constructed from the gauge - boson @xmath3-point function and fermion  gauge - boson vertex , a @xmath4-point function .",
    "in addition , while a weak - coupling expansion yields all the diagrams of perturbation theory , a self - consistent solution of the gap equation exhibits nonperturbative effects unobtainable at any finite order in perturbation theory ; e.g , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "the coupling between equations ; namely , the fact that the equation for a given @xmath5-point function always involves at least one @xmath6-point function , necessitates a truncation of the tower of dses in order to define a tractable problem .",
    "it is unsurprising that the best known truncation scheme is just the weak coupling expansion which reproduces every diagram in perturbation theory .",
    "this scheme is systematic and valuable in the analysis of large momentum transfer processes because qcd is asymptotically free .",
    "however , it precludes the study of nonperturbative effects , and hence something else is needed for the investigation of strongly interacting systems and bound state phenomena .    in spite of the need for a truncation , gap equations have long been used effectively in obtaining nonperturbative information about many - body systems as , e.g. , in the nambu - gorkov formalism for superconductivity .",
    "the positive outcomes have been achieved through the simple expedient of employing the most rudimentary truncation , e.g. , hartree or hartree - fock , and comparing the results with observations .",
    "of course , agreement under these circumstances is not an unambiguous indication that the contributions omitted are small nor that the model expressed in the truncation is sound .",
    "however , it does justify further study , and an accumulation of good results is grounds for a concerted attempt to substantiate a reinterpretation of the truncation as the first term in a systematic and reliable approximation .    the modern application of dses , notably , comparisons with and predictions of experimental data , can properly be said to rest on model assumptions .",
    "however , those assumptions can be tested within the framework and also via comparison with lattice - qcd simulations , and the predictions are excellent .",
    "furthermore , progress in understanding the intimate connection between symmetries and truncation schemes has enabled exact results to be proved .",
    "herein i will briefly explain recent phenomenological applications and the foundation of their success , and focus especially on the links the approach provides between light- and heavy - quark phenomena .",
    "it will become apparent that the momentum - dependent _ dressing _ of the propagators of qcd s elementary excitations is a fundamental and observable feature of strong qcd .",

    "@xcite . ) ]    it has recently become clear that the simple rainbow - ladder dse truncation is the first term in a systematic and nonperturbative scheme that preserves the ward - takahashi identities which express conservation laws at an hadronic level . this has enabled the proof of exact results in qcd , and explains why the truncation has been successful for light vector and flavour nonsinglet pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "emulating more of these achievements with _ ab initio _ calculations of heavy - meson properties is a modern challenge .",
    "however , at present , the study of heavy - meson systems using dse methods stands approximately at the point occupied by those of light - meson properties seven  eight years ago .",
    "a poincar covariant treatment exploiting essential features , such as propagator dressing and sensible bound state bethe - salpeter amplitudes , has been shown capable of providing a unified and successful description of light- and heavy - meson observables .",
    "the goal now is to make the case compelling by tying the separate elements together ; namely , relating the propagators and bethe - salpeter amplitudes via a single kernel .",
    "i am confident this will be accomplished , and the dses become a quantitatively reliable and intuition building tool as much in the heavy - quark sector as they are for light - quark systems .    while a more detailed understanding will be attained in pursuing this goal , certain qualitative results established already are unlikely to change . for example , it is plain that light- and heavy - mesons are essentially the same , they are simply bound states of dressed - quarks . moreover ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath140-quark s current - mass is large enough to sustain heavy - quark approximations for its propagator and the amplitudes for bound states of which it is a constituent . in addition , and unfortunately in so far as practical constraints on the standard model are concerned , the current - mass of the @xmath122-quark is too small to validate an heavy - quark approximation .",
    "i am grateful for the hospitality and support of my colleagues and the staff in the bogoliubov laboratory of theoretical physics at the joint institute for nuclear research , dubna , russia .",
