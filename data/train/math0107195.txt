    "the _ manneville map _ was introduced by manneville in @xcite , as an example of a discrete dissipative dynamical system with _",
    "intermittency _ , an alternation between long regular phases , called _ laminar _ , and short irregular phases , called _",
    "turbulent_. this behaviour had been observed in fluid dynamics experiments and in chemical reactions .",
    "manneville introduced his map , defined on the interval @xmath2 $ ] by @xmath3 to have a simple model displaying this complicated behaviour . in figure [ figmann ]",
    "it is plotted the manneville map for @xmath4 .",
    "his work has attracted much attention , and the dynamics of the manneville map has been found in many other systems .",
    "we can find applications of the manneville map in dynamical approaches to dna sequences ( @xcite,@xcite ) and ion channels ( @xcite ) , and in non - extensive thermodynamical problems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the manneville map has also been studied by gaspard and wang ( @xcite ) , using the notion of _ algorithmic information content _ of a string , briefly explained below .",
    "given a dynamical system , any orbit of this system can be translated into a string @xmath5 of symbols by a partition of the phase space of the system ( symbolic dynamics ) . for any finite string @xmath6 of length @xmath7",
    ", it has been introduced by chaitin ( @xcite ) and kolmogorov ( @xcite ) , the notion of _ algorithmic information content ( aic ) _ ( or _ kolmogorov complexity _ ) of the string , that we denote by @xmath8 , defined as the binary length of the shortest program @xmath9 that outputs the string on a universal machine @xmath10 , @xmath11    it is then possible , using the symbolic dynamics , to define the notion of algorithmic information content for a finite orbit of a dynamical system .",
    "this extension requires some attention on the choice of the partition .",
    "the first results have been obtained by brudno ( @xcite ) using open covers of the phase space .",
    "another possible approach , using computable partitions , is introduced in @xcite .    to generalize the notion of aic to infinite strings ,",
    "it is natural to consider the mean of the aic .",
    "we call _ complexity _ of an infinite string @xmath5 the maximum limit of the aic of the first @xmath7 symbols of the string divided by @xmath7 . then , if we denote the complexity of an infinite string by @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 where @xmath6 is the string given by the first @xmath7 digits of the infinite string @xmath5 .",
    "symbolic dynamics is again the tool to define the complexity of an infinite orbit of a dynamical system .",
    "moreover , we can ask whether it is possible to define a notion of information content for the dynamical system , without to consider any particular orbit . to do this",
    ", we have to introduce a probability measure @xmath14 on the phase space @xmath15 of the system and we can define the _ algorithmic entropy _",
    "@xmath16 of a dynamical system by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the complexity of the orbit of the system with initial condition @xmath19 .",
    "there exist some results connecting the information content of a string generated by a dynamical system and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath20 of the system .",
    "first of all it is proved that for a compact phase space @xmath15 and for an invariant measure @xmath14 , we have @xmath21 . then in particular , in a dynamical system with an ergodic invariant measure @xmath14 with positive k - s entropy @xmath22 , the aic of a string @xmath7 symbols long behaves like @xmath23 for almost any initial condition with respect to the measure @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .    instead ,",
    "in a periodic dynamical system , we expect to find @xmath24 . indeed , the shortest program that outputs the string @xmath6 would contain only information on the period of the string and on its length .",
    "it is possible to have also intermediate cases , in which the k - s entropy is null for all the invariant measures that are physically relevant and the system is not periodic . these systems , whose behaviour has been defined _ weak chaos _",
    ", are an important challenge for research on dynamical systems . indeed no information are given by the classical properties , such as k - s entropy or lyapunov exponents , and in the last years",
    "some generalized definitions of entropy of a system have been introduced to characterize the behaviour of such systems ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that an approach to weakly chaotic systems using the infinite order of their aic could be a powerful way to classify these systems ( no information are obtained by the complexity and the algorithmic entropy defined as above ) .",
    "the manneville map with parameter @xmath25 is a non periodic map with null k - s entropy for all the physically relevant invariant measures , then the analysis of the aic of the strings generated by the map is interesting .",
    "gaspard and wang ( @xcite ) showed that the manneville map exhibits a behaviour that they called _",
    "sporadicity_. namely , the algorithmic information content , @xmath8 , of a string @xmath7 symbols long , behaves in mean like @xmath26 , with either @xmath27 or @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in this paper",
    ", we give a formal proof of the results obtained by gaspard and wang ( @xcite ) for the manneville map , giving more precise estimates for the aic of a string generated by the map .",
    "but the most important generalization is that we find our results for the manneville map as a particular case of a general theorem concerning a large family of maps @xmath30 , defined in equation ( [ mannmaplin ] ) .",
    "this family of maps exhibits an extremely wide range of behaviours ( for the aic of the generated strings ) , and sporadicity is only one possible case .",
    "then we find a family of maps that can be classified with respect to the order of the aic of a `` typical''(in the sense of lebesgue measure ) initial condition .",
    "moreover we study some topological and metric properties of the maps @xmath30 , useful to obtain a prediction of the behaviour of the aic of the related symbolic dynamics ( see section [ stca ] ) .    in section [ stlm ]",
    ", we introduce the family of maps @xmath30 , and show how the manneville map @xmath31 can be thought of as one member of the family .    in section [ stta",
    "] , we study the maps @xmath30 from the topological point of view . in section [ stma ]",
    "we show that the maps in the class @xmath30 are equivalent to a markov chain in a suitable sense .",
    "this equivalence is extensively used in subsection [ ssgr ] , where we present our results relative to the behaviour of the aic of the strings obtained from the maps @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in subsection [ ssrttlm ] , we study the computational aspect of the maps @xmath30 from a practical point of view .",
    "so , we restrict ourselves to consider the lebesgue measure @xmath32 on the interval @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we present what we shall use as our formulation of the manneville map ( [ mannmap ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we study a family of piecewise linear maps @xmath30 on the interval @xmath2 $ ] , which are topologically equivalent to the manneville map @xmath31 .",
    "using the maps @xmath30 , all the theorems have an easier interpretation and computations can be done exactly .",
    "moreover all our results are extendible through metric isomorphism , hence we shall define on the interval @xmath33 , two different measures that make the topological equivalence between @xmath30 and @xmath31 a metric isomorphism",
    ". then we can extend all the results that we find for the maps @xmath30 to the manneville map @xmath31 .",
    "let s start defining the piecewise linear maps @xmath30 that we consider .",
    "we use here the same approach as in @xcite . a natural way to get a partition of the interval @xmath2 $ ] from the manneville map @xmath31 is the following : let s call @xmath34 the point of @xmath33 such that @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 the preimage of @xmath34 in the interval @xmath38 $ ] ; then we define recursively @xmath39 $ ] . then the sub - intervals @xmath40 $ ] , for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 $ ] are a partition of @xmath33 .",

    "we define a subset @xmath131 of @xmath117 , by @xmath132 then a _ sub - shift of finite type _ is simply the compact , metric space @xmath133 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have    for any @xmath134 , there exists a particular transition matrix @xmath135 such that any map @xmath30 of the family of piecewise linear maps ( [ mannmaplin ] ) is a factor of the sub - shift of finite type @xmath133 .",

    "we have then a _ semi - conjugacy _ between our piecewise linear maps @xmath30 and symbolic dynamics .",
    "we have not a conjugacy because of the lack of injectivity of the map @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , as in any @xmath7-ary representation of the real numbers in the interval @xmath2 $ ] , there is a countable set @xmath15 of points that are images of two sequences .",

    "* the proof is the same as in theorem [ eqdinsimb ] .",
    "the difference is that now we obtain a _ conjugacy _ with the set @xmath183 , thanks to the fact that the matrix @xmath135 , being infinite , exactly simulate the dynamics of the piecewise linear maps @xmath30 from a topological point of view .",
    "the semi - conjugacy of the maps @xmath30 with the symbolic dynamical system on finite symbols is useful to compute some topological and metric quantities of our map . indeed",
