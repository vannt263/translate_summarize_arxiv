    "recent discovery of the exotic @xmath0 pentaquark state ( @xmath6 ) by the leps collaboration  @xcite and its further confirmation by a number of other experiments @xcite , together with still unconfirmed observation of an exotic @xmath7 states by the na49 experiment at cern  @xcite renewed interest in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "experimental searches for these new states were motivated by the theoretical prediction of the chiral quark - soliton model  diakonov:1997 mm , where masses and decay widths of exotic antidecuplet baryons were predicted .",
    "in fact , exotic su(3 ) representations containing exotic baryonic states are naturally accommodated within the chiral soliton models  @xcite and early estimates of their masses are given in refs.@xcite .",
    "the findings of the pentaquark baryon @xmath8 and possibly of @xmath9 have triggered intensive theoretical investigations which are summarized in refs.@xcite . despite differences in theoretical models of pentaquarks",
    "it is by most theorists agree upon the fact that @xmath8 is the @xmath10 , @xmath11 member of the antidecuplet representation of su(3 ) flavor and @xmath12 has @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the lowest possible spin is @xmath15 .",
    "models differ as far as parity is concerned , where the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath16qsm ) considered here predicts positive parity .",
    "if so , cryptoexotic nucleon - like and @xmath17-like pentaquark states that span the remainder of @xmath18 should also exist .",
    "these states most probably will mix with the nearby nonexotic excited three quark states and with higher exotic states like the members of flavor @xmath19-plet for example .",
    "it is of utmost importance to decide whether these cryptoexotic states are the known resonances of the particle data group ( pdg ) that were misinterpreted as three quark states or if there exist new , possibly narrow resonances that eluded detection so far . a recent modified partial wave analysis of @xmath20 scattering @xcite , a new graal experiment on @xmath21 photoproduction off the neutron @xcite , and",
    "the preliminary star data  @xcite suggest that such new nucleon - like states may indeed exist .",
    "in particular , the graal data are consistent with the antidecuplet interpretation  @xcite of the narrow peak around the mass 1670 mev .    in the present work ,",
    "we address the question of magnetic transitions which are relevant for the interpretation of the graal data .",
    "recently , four of the present authors calculated the magnetic moments of the exotic and cryptoexotic pentaquarks , within the framework of the @xmath22qsm including chiral symmetry breaking effects due to the nonzero strange quark mass in the so called _ model - independent approach _  @xcite .",
    "such an approach  introduced to our knowledge for the first time by adkins and nappi  @xcite in the context of the skyrme model  can be viewed from two perspectives .",
    "firstly , it can be considered as a qcd - motivated tool to analyze and classify ( in terms of powers of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) the symmetry breaking terms for a given observable . for nontrivial operators such as magnetic moments or axial",
    "form factors a general analysis , without refering to some specific model , is often virtually impossible .",
    "secondly , it also provides information for the model builders .",
    "it tells us what are the best predictions the model can ever produce . indeed",
    ", model calculations are not as unique as one might think : they depend on adopted regularization , cutoff parameters , constituent quark mass , etc . on the other hand the success of such",
    "an analysis gives a strong hint for the model builders that the model is correct and worth exploring .",
    "in fact , this concerns all the hedgehog models which would give the collective structure identical to the one of the @xmath22qsm including the skyrme model .",
    "however , for the simplest version of the skyrme model , some of the parameters multiplying the group theoretical operators are identically zero , whereas in the @xmath22qsm they do not vanish due to the presence of the valence level .    the discovery of @xmath8 and possibly of @xmath12 constrained certain parameters of the @xmath22qsm that were previously undetermined .",
    "this new phenomenological input allowed us to revise previous estimates of magnetic moments both for nonexotic  @xcite and exotic baryons @xcite .",
    "in particular , it turned out that magnetic moment of @xmath8 is negative and rather sensitive to the residual freedom which we parameterize in terms of the pion nucleon sigma term : @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the recent analysis of ref.@xcite from magnetic moments to magnetic transitions . using the parametrization obtained in refs.@xcite",
    ", we show that the @xmath22qsm reproduces well experimental and empirical data for the magnetic transitions @xmath26 and @xmath2 and are rather insensitive to @xmath27 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath28 and show that it is consistent with a constraint obtained by the recent selex experiment  @xcite .",
    "finally we make predictions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are nucleon - like antidecuplet states .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath33 is small and almost independent of @xmath27 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath29 is large and depends rather strongly on @xmath27 .",
    "this feature allows us to explain the recent graal data on @xmath5 production off the nucleon .    in the present work",
    ", we give explicit formulae for the magnetic transition moments and discuss the corresponding numerical results and their phenomenological consequences , in particular , in the context of the recent selex  @xcite and graal experiments  @xcite .",
    "we first recapitulate very briefly the formalism of ref.@xcite , where the details may be found . the collective hamiltonian describing baryons in the su(3 )",
    "@xmath22qsm takes the following form @xcite : @xmath34 with the symmetry breaking piece given by : @xmath35 where parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are proportional to the strange current quark mass @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 denote su(3 ) wigner rotation matrices and @xmath41 is a collective spin operator .",
    "taking into account the recent experimental observation of the mass of @xmath0 the parameters entering eq.([hsplit ] ) can be conveniently parameterized in terms of the pion - nucleon @xmath42 term ( assuming @xmath43 ) as @xcite : @xmath44 ( in units of mev ) .",
    "moreover , the inertia parameters which describe the representation splittings take the following values ( in mev ) @xmath45 equations ( [ albega ] ) and ( [ isigma ] ) follow from the fit to the masses of octet and decuplet baryons and of @xmath0 as well .",
    "if , furthermore , one imposes the additional constraint that @xmath46 mev , then @xmath47 mev @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in agreement with recent experimental estimates  @xcite .    because the hamiltonian of eq.([hsplit ] ) mixes different su(3 ) representations ,",
    "the collective wave functions are given as linear combinations @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the state which reduces to the su(3 ) representation @xmath50 in the formal limit @xmath51 .",
    "the spin index @xmath52 has been suppressed .",
    "the @xmath39-dependent ( through the linear @xmath39 dependence of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath53 ) coefficients in eq.([admix ] ) can be found in ref.@xcite .    the magnetic moment",
    "collective operator can be parameterized by six constants that in the _ model independent approach _ are treated as free  @xcite : @xmath54 parameters @xmath55 are of the order @xmath56 .",
    "the full expression for the magnetic moments can be decomposed as follows@xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by the matrix element of @xmath59 between the pure symmetry states @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is given as the matrix element of @xmath62 between the symmetry states as well .",
    "wave function correction @xmath63 is given as a sum of the interference matrix elements of @xmath58 between pure symmetry states and admixtures displayed in eq.([admix ] ) .",
    "these matrix elements were calculated for octet and decuplet baryons in ref.@xcite and for antidecuplet in ref.@xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    "an overal fit to octet magnetic moments has been performed with input parameters given by eq.([albega ] ) .",
    "the resulting values for constants @xmath64 can be conveniently parameterized as follows : @xmath65 interestingly only @xmath66 is a nonlinear function of @xmath27 .",
    "the fit presented in eq.([wis ] ) works well for @xmath67 mev .",
    "the transition form factors @xmath68 from the baryon antidecuplet to the octet are expressed in the quark matrix elements as follows : @xmath69 u_{b_{% \\overline{10}}}({\\bm p } , \\lambda ) ,   \\label{eq : em1}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the square of the four - momentum transfer , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the mass of the baryon octet and antideucplet , respectively .",
    "@xmath73 are the corresponding spinors . the electromagnetic quark current @xmath74 is defined as @xmath75 with the charge operator of the quark field @xmath76 : @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the third component of the isospin and hypercharge given by the gell - mann  nishjima formula .",
    "similarly , the transition form factors from the baryon decuplet to the octet are defined as  @xcite @xmath80 u_{b_{10}}^{\\beta } ( { \\bm p } , \\lambda ) ,   \\label{eq : em2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are , respectively , the magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole , and coulomb form factors .",

    "since the magnetic dipole transitions ( @xmath90 ) are experimentally dominant over the electric quadrupole transitions ( @xmath91 ) in hyperon radiative decays , one can neglect the @xmath91 transitions .",
    "thus , we can express the partial decay width in terms of the transition magnetic moments .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : em1],[eq : em2 ] ) and neglecting the @xmath91 transitions , we obtain the partial width of radiative decays from the baryon antidecuplet to the octet and from the decuplet to the octet , respectively : @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the fine structure constant and @xmath94 is the energy of the produced photon : @xmath95    in the present work , we are interested in the following transition magnetic moments ( in units of nuclear magneton @xmath96 ) : @xmath97      the experimental value  @xcite is known : @xmath98    the partial decay widths for @xmath99 are expressed in terms of helicity amplitudes @xmath100 and @xmath101 for radiative decays  @xcite:@xmath102    \\label{eq : decay0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 with the magnetic dipole ( @xmath104 ) and electric quadrupole ( @xmath105 ) amplitudes .",
    "eq.([eq : decay0 ] ) being used , the empirical value of the @xmath106 can be extracted from the data for the helicity amplitudes @xmath107",
    "@xcite : @xmath108and the ratio @xmath109  @xcite : @xmath110 the extracted value for the @xmath111 transition magnetic moment is approximately : @xmath112 note that the @xmath104 transition amplitude  @xcite is related to the transition magnetic moment by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the electric charge .",
    "putting eq.([eq : m1 ] ) into eq.(eq : decay0 ) , we eaily find that it is just the same as eq.([eq : parwidth ] ) .",
    "recently , the selex collaboration  @xcite has announced the upper limit on the partial width for the radiative decay of @xmath115 @xmath116 : @xmath117 at @xmath118 confidence level .",
    "using eq.([eq : parwidth ] ) , we can extract the upper bound for the @xmath119 transition magnetic moment from the selex data : @xmath120 since the radiative decay @xmath121 is forbidden in su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite , the pertinent magnetic transition moment provides us the measure of explicit su(3)-symmetry breaking .",
    "the graal experiment  @xcite indicated that a possible resonant structure with a narrow peak at @xmath122 gev could exist in @xmath21 photoproduction off the neutron , i.e. @xmath123 , which was not found in @xmath124 reaction .",
    "this resonant peak looks promising as a candidate for the non - strange pentaquark baryon , though one should not exclude that it could be a manifestation of one of known resonances such as @xmath125  @xcite . if the observed peak originates from the excitation of the pentaquark baryon @xmath126 , it is of great importance to investigate the transition magnetic moments between the non - strange pentaquarks and the nucleons , since their partial decay widths are proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "indeed , we will show that the present results are compatible with the graal experiment , assuming that the observed peak is in fact interpreted as the non - strange pentaquark @xmath126 .",
    "the predictions for the matrix elements entering eqs.([mutransdef ] ) in the @xmath22qsm are given below .",
    "as for the leading order ( @xmath128 ) , we obtain the following expressions : @xmath129 let us note that both @xmath130 and @xmath131 vanish in this order due to the charge factors @xmath132 , respectively . as mentioned above , this is entirely due to the su(3 ) flavor symmetry : the @xmath22qsm provides a link between various reduced matrix elements expressed in terms of the constants @xmath133 .",
    "note that the transitions from the nonexotic baryon decuplet and the octet states depend only on the combination @xmath134 and therefore @xmath135 and @xmath136 can not be extracted separately in the zeroth order in @xmath39 .",
    "the deviation from zero of @xmath130 , @xmath137 , and @xmath131 is entirely due to the symmetry breaking terms .",
    "thus , these transition magnetic moments will measure directly the strength of su(3)-symmetry breaking in light baryons .",
    "let us also note that the @xmath138-n transitions do not depend on charge , which will be also true for their @xmath139 corrections .",
    "we find that the transition magnetic moments of eq.([mu0 ] ) satisfy the following relations based on pure su(3)-symmetry : @xmath140 which are the same as those in ref .",
    "@xcite apart from the relative signs .",
    "the sign difference arises from the different convention for the baryon states .",
    "in addition , the transition magnetic moment @xmath26 can be expressed in terms of @xmath141 and @xmath142 : @xmath143    the wave function corrections read as follows : @xmath144 \\cr & & -\\frac{1}{180\\sqrt{5}}d_{27}(q+2)% \\left(w_{1}+2w_{2}-\\frac{3}{2 } w_{3}\\right)\\cr & & -\\frac{7}{144\\sqrt{5}}% c_{27}(7q-4)\\left(w_{1}-\\frac{11}{14}w_{2 } - \\frac{3}{14}w_{3}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the relation @xmath145",

    "@xcite that the magnetic moments of the baryon decuplet are almost insensitive to the @xmath27 term . here",
    "we find that almost all transition magnetic moments between the decuplet and the octet are very weakly dependent on @xmath27 .",
    "this can be easily understood by eq.([mu0 ] ) : aparently the leading - order terms are proportional to @xmath159 whose dependence on @xmath27 vanishes according to eq.([wis ] ) .",
    "the @xmath27 dependence enters only via @xmath23 corrections which are rather small .",
    "the @xmath160 and @xmath151 transition magnetic moments , which have only the non - zero values with su(3 ) symmetry breaking terms , are shown to depend mildly on @xmath27 .",

    "the linear @xmath23 corrections are almost negligible for the transition magnetic moments @xmath161 and @xmath162 , whereas they contribute to @xmath2 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 at around 20 % .",
    "since @xmath165 and @xmath166 vanish in pure su(3 ) symmetry , their values arise soley from the effects of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",

    "it is very similar to the situation in the case of the magnetic moments of the baryon antidecuplet  @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that e.g. @xmath167 is proportional to @xmath168 .",
