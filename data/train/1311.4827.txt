    "when measuring the intensity of optical radiation , the registered signal is inevitably burdened with photon ( poisson ) noise , and the statistics concerning the received signal differ from those of incident radiation .",
    "this noise is not additive and in the case of fluctuating incident radiation its power changes depending on the radiation s instantaneous intensity .",
    "the problem concerning the contribution of photon noise in the measured statistical characteristics is considered a classical problem that has been solved many years ago .",
    "particular interest in the problem was triggered during the interpretation of the non - classical interference of light , study of raman scattering , and photon correlation spectroscopy ( see for e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "calculating the contribution of photon noise is important to several experimental works , particularly those that involve the photon counting method in low - light applications .",
    "it has been shown that the registered mean , variance , and correlations are related with the corresponding set of statistics for stochastic radiation in a simple manner .",
    "a simple relationship called the mandel relation @xcite connects the moments of any order of fluctuating intensity with the corresponding factorial moments of photon counts .",
    "the mandel relation is a convenient expression that has been repeatedly used , including in the study of stellar scintillation statistics @xcite .",
    "however , this relation is valid for an ideal detector while practical photoelectric detectors are not ideal .",
    "firstly , the photon - counting method involves nonlinearity caused by the presence of dead time in the registration chain .",
    "for example , in the measurements of stellar scintillation with the multi - aperture scintillation sensor ( mass ) @xcite , accounting for nonlinearity is an essential step in signal processing @xcite , because in order to achieve the necessary statistical accuracy , we are forced to choose bright stars .",
    "the attenuation of the light flux is not a solution , since in this case , a well - known effect that a single - photon detector may have after - pulses of different nature , becomes more noticeable .",
    "this effect also distorts the statistics of registered events .",
    "the after - pulse effect has not thus far been properly studied from the theoretical viewpoint , and ill - grounded empirical arguments are used to describe the effect .    in this study , we present analogues of the mandel relation , which connect the moments of a stochastically fluctuating light flux ( hereafter reffered to as scintillation ) with the factorial moments of the registered counts for the case of noticeable nonlinearity of any given photon counter .",
    "the expressions are derived for both non - paralyzable and paralyzable dead time , i.e. , counters of both the first ( i ) and the second ( ii ) types .",
    "the relations consider the effect of after - pulses as well .",
