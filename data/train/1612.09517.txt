    "spin dynamics play an important role in many systems of biological and chemical interest , such as magnetoreceptors,@xcite organic semiconductors,@xcite and molecular wires.@xcite the spin - selective behaviour exhibited by these systems is often explained using the radical pair model , in which two coupled electron spins interact with a number of hyperfine - coupled nuclear spins . when this number exceeds twenty or so , standard quantum mechanical calculations become cripplingly expensive , and while in some cases semiclassical approximations have been shown to be accurate,@xcite this can not always be relied on . as a result",
    ", there is a clear need for a more efficient quantum mechanical method for describing the spin dynamics of radical pairs .",
    "a simplified radical pair reaction scheme is given in figure [ rpr ] .",
    "photoexcitation of an organic precursor molecule produces a radical pair in the singlet state , which can then undergo intersystem crossing to form the triplet state .",
    "the singlet and triplet radical pairs can each recombine , in general at different rates and forming different products .",
    "the intersystem crossing is mediated by hyperfine interactions between the electron and nuclear spins in each radical , and as a result is affected by the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "this in turn can modify the lifetime of the radical pair , and the singlet and triplet recombination yields .",
    "the resulting magnetic field effects ( mfes)@xcite are often measured in order to probe the spin dynamics of the radical pair , but it is usually not possible to extract the spin - specific rate constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the experiments alone . more insight can often be gained by comparing the experimental results to simulations .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the radical pair model is well understood , and simulations of small spin systems can be done routinely.@xcite however , simulating realistic systems is often challenging , due to the exponential scaling of the size of the hilbert space with the number of nuclear spins .",
    "previous theoretical calculations have been performed either by neglecting smaller hyperfine couplings to reduce the size of the hilbert space,@xcite or by using semiclassical methods to avoid the exponential scaling.@xcite however , neither approach is entirely reliable for systems with @xmath9 nuclear spins , which are commonplace in chemical and biological systems .",
    "it is not always safe to assume that weakly - coupled nuclear spins make no contribution to the spin dynamics , and semiclassical approximations are incapable of capturing subtle quantum mechanical effects such as the recently - discovered quantum needle \" of the avian magnetic compass.@xcite    we shall therefore now present a new method that dramatically improves the efficiency of quantum mechanical spin dynamics simulations , allowing the treatment of significantly larger radical pairs . to illustrate this",
    ", we shall calculate the singlet yield of a strongly - coupled radical pair involving 20 nuclear spins , over a wide range of magnetic field strengths",
    ". this calculation would be quite impractical using a standard quantum mechanical method , and while various semiclassical approximations are applicable to the problem we shall demonstrate that they are only qualitatively accurate .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian that governs the spin dynamics of a radical pair tumbling in solution includes isotropic zeeman and hyperfine interactions and an exchange coupling between the two electron spins : @xmath10 here @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron and @xmath13 is the applied magnetic field .",
    "@xmath14 is the hyperfine coupling constant between the @xmath15th nuclear spin and the electron spin in radical @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the corresponding nuclear and electron spin operators , @xmath19 is the number of nuclear spins in the radical , and @xmath20 is the exchange coupling constant .",
    "note that we have neglected the comparatively weak nuclear spin zeeman interactions , we have assumed for simplicity that the electrons in the two radicals have the same gyromagnetic ratio , and we are working in a unit system in which @xmath21 .",
    "the recombination of the radical pair is conventionally modelled using the haberkorn operator,@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 are the projection operators onto the singlet and triplet electronic subspaces , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the first order rate constants for recombination of singlet and triplet states respectively .",
    "the evolution of the density operator @xmath25 which describes the radical pair is then governed by the quantum liouville equation@xcite @xmath26-\\{\\hat{k},\\hat{\\rho}(t)\\ } , \\label{liouville}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] is the commutator and @xmath28 the anticommutator of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "becomes @xmath47 where @xmath48 indicates the sum over all possible nuclear spin states @xmath43 .",
    "in the case of photoexcited radical pairs formed in the singlet state , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total number of nuclear spin states in the radical pair .",
    "the sum over @xmath38 in eq .   can then be evaluated immediately : the only term that survives is that with @xmath51 . defining @xmath52",
    "the trace becomes @xmath53 therefore , the ensemble average @xmath54 can be evaluated by propagating @xmath1 wavepackets with orthogonal initial nuclear spin states and calculating the expectation value of @xmath29 in each state at time @xmath32 .    the wavepacket propagation in eq .",
    "can be performed using the short iterative arnoldi ( sia ) method.@xcite this is a generalisation of the short iterative lanczos ( sil ) method@xcite which allows for propagators generated from non - hermitian operators , as is the case here .",
    "the sparsity of the hamiltonian means that hamiltonian - wavepacket multiplications require only @xmath55 operations,@xcite and combined with the adaptive time step of the sia method , this leads to very efficient wavepacket propagation . as a result ,",
    "the computational time required to evaluate eq .",
    "scales as @xmath56 . in order to improve this scaling , either the efficiency of the wavepacket propagation must be improved , or fewer propagations must be carried out . we will now demonstrate that the latter is easily achieved if the trace in eq .",
    "is evaluated using monte carlo integration over the coherent spin state basis of the nuclear spins .",
    "for a spin with quantum number @xmath20 , a coherent spin state @xmath57 is obtained by rotating the quantisation axis of the @xmath58 eigenstate of @xmath59 to lie in the direction @xmath60 .",

    "in order to investigate this , we have calculated the singlet yield of a particularly demanding radical pair in which the hyperfine , zeeman , and electronic exchange interactions were all chosen to have similar orders of magnitude ( the most strongly coupled scenario ) .",
    "this singlet yield is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ensemble average of the singlet probability at time @xmath32 , obtained by substituting @xmath84 into eq .  .",
    "in our model system , each electron was coupled to ten @xmath85 nuclear spins with randomly generated hyperfine coupling constants uniformly distributed between @xmath86 mt ; these hyperfine constants are listed for completeness in table [ table ] . the exchange coupling constant",
    "was taken to be @xmath87 mt , comparable to the effective hyperfine field strength @xmath88 in each radical ( @xmath89 mt and @xmath90 mt ) , and the recombination rate constants were taken to be @xmath91 mt and @xmath92 mt .",
    "figure [ convergence ] shows how the singlet singlet yield of this model radical pair converges with increasing @xmath3 over a wide range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "the results are converged to graphical accuracy at all field strengths with only @xmath93 samples . since",
    "the total number of nuclear spin states in the radical pair is @xmath94 1,048,576 , this stochastic calculation was @xmath95 times faster than the equivalent deterministic calculation .",
    "the form of the mfe on the singlet yield shown in fig .",
    "[ convergence ] can be understood by considering the energy levels of the electronic spin states of the radical pair , shown schematically in figure [ energies ] . at both zero and high fields ,",
    "the singlet state is energetically separated from the triplet states , which leads to slow intersystem crossing .",
    "but when @xmath96 , the singlet state is degenerate with the @xmath97 state , and hyperfine mediated intersystem crossing becomes much more efficient . since the radical pair is formed in the singlet state , any intersystem crossing will reduce the singlet yield .",
    "therefore , a minimum is observed in the the singlet yield when @xmath96 .",
    "this also explains the observation from the statistical error bars in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ convergence ] that the convergence of the monte carlo integration is slowest around the minimum in the singlet yield .",
    "away from resonance , the hyperfine interactions play only a small role in the spin dynamics , and the singlet yield obtained from each individual wavepacket does not vary significantly between monte carlo samples .",
    "however , when the intersystem crossing is fast , the singlet yield depends more strongly on the initial nuclear spin state , and more samples are required for convergence .",
    "the field dependent sensitivity of the spin dynamics to the initial nuclear spin state is illustrated by the distribution of singlet yields obtained from individual wavepackets , @xmath98 figure [ hist ] shows a histogram of 1000 evaluations of this single wavepacket contribution to the singlet yield at three different magnetic field strengths .",
    "this highlights the increased variation in @xmath99 when intersystem crossing becomes more efficient .",
    "nevertheless , even when @xmath96 , the number of coherent spin state samples required to converge the ensemble - averaged singlet yield is still far smaller than the total number of nuclear spin states , @xmath1 .",
    "this analysis also explains why stochastic integration over coherent spin states is so efficient . since the singlet yield is bounded between zero and one , the maximum possible standard deviation in the distribution of @xmath99",
    "is @xmath100 . in practice ,",
    "the distribution is confined to a smaller range , and so has a smaller standard deviation . when performing a monte carlo integration with random sampling",
    ", the standard deviation is related to the standard ( statistical ) error in the integral , @xmath101 , and the number of samples , @xmath3 , by@xcite @xmath102 therefore , the necessarily small standard deviation in the distribution of singlet yields means that only a small number of samples is required for convergence .",
    "we expect this observation to be general , since the observables of interest in radical pair spin dynamics calculations are invariably probabilities or yields , which must be bounded between zero and one . as a result , the stochastic approach should be applicable to a wide range of radical pair observables . while the precise number of samples required to obtain converged results will doubtless vary from system to system",
    ", it seems likely that for radical pairs with @xmath103 nuclear spins , @xmath3 will be significantly smaller than the number of nuclear spin states .    in order to establish whether a fully quantum mechanical simulation is necessary to describe systems of this type ,",
    "we have also applied two semiclassical methods to this model problem .",
    "figure [ methods ] compares the converged quantum mechanical ( qm ) results with those obtained using the original semiclassical theory of schulten and wolynes ( sw),@xcite adapted to the calculation of radical pair singlet yields as described in ref .  , and an improved semiclassical ( sc ) theory that takes the nuclear spin precession into account.@xcite unsurprisingly , the improved sc theory performs better than sw theory across the whole range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , neither method is quantitatively accurate . clearly , in this case , where the hyperfine interactions , exchange coupling , and triplet recombination rate are all of a similar magnitude , semiclassical models are not accurate enough to capture the fine details of the spin dynamics .    finally , as an alternative to the method presented here , we have considered the possibility of stochastically sampling @xmath69 and @xmath70 in order to evaluate the sums in eq .  .",
    "we found that the convergence was much slower than when sampling coherent spin states .",
    "the reason for this lies in the fact that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "commutes with the total spin projection operator , @xmath104 .",
    "this divides the hilbert space into sectors of different @xmath105 , which all contribute independently to @xmath106 .",
    "since the state @xmath107 is an eigenstate of @xmath59 , each choice of @xmath69 and @xmath70 samples only a single sector of the total hilbert space .",
    "by contrast , each coherent spin state includes some contribution from every @xmath105 sector in the space .",
    "if anisotropic hyperfine coupling or dipolar coupling were introduced , the hamiltonian would no longer commute with @xmath59 , and so we expect that the convergence of results obtained by stochastically sampling the eigenstates of @xmath59 would be faster .",
    "nonetheless , we would still expect the results from sampling coherent spin states to converge at least as quickly .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately simulate the spin dynamics of radical pairs containing all physically relevant couplings between the electron spins and at least 20 nuclear spins .",
    "this is the typical size of radical pair that arises in many interesting problems in chemistry and biology .",
    "we have also shown that semiclassical methods are not always quantitatively accurate for this size of system , although they are expected to become more accurate for larger spin systems.@xcite in future work , we shall use the present method to analyse the results of the intriguing experiments of wasielewski and co - workers@xcite on spin - dependent charge recombination along molecular wires,@xcite and also show how electron spin relaxation can be incorporated in the present theory by including the molecular motions that induce it.@xcite                                                           for example , suppose that all of the @xmath73 nuclear spins have @xmath85 , and that the magnetic field @xmath13 is taken to lie in the @xmath46 direction .",
    "then it is straightforward to count the number of non - zero matrix elements of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the basis @xmath108 .",
    "there are @xmath109 elements on the diagonal , @xmath110 non - zero off - diagonal elements arising from the operator @xmath111 , and a further @xmath112 non - zero off - diagonal elements arising from the @xmath113 operators @xmath114 , giving @xmath115 non - zero matrix elements overall .",
    "this is clearly @xmath116 as we have claimed in the text ."
