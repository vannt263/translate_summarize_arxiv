    "the growth of in@xmath0ga@xmath1nalloys along the @xmath5 $ ] direction ( known as n - polar orientation ) with high in contents has regained interest because it offers potential advantages for the fabrication of green light - emitting diodes ( leds ) . despite the rougher surfaces and higher concentrations of impurities in n - polar group - iii nitride films as compared to their ga - polar ( i.e. , @xmath6 $ ] oriented ) counterparts grown under identical conditions,@xcite the @xmath5 $ ] orientation offers two interesting advantages .",
    "the first of these advantages is an enhanced in - incorporation efficiency.@xcite this phenomenon is the result of the higher thermal stability of n - polar inn and paves the way for the use of significantly higher substrate temperatures@xcite that may help to improve the crystal quality as well as to minimize the incorporation of impurities .",
    "the second advantage is related to the expected improvement in device performance caused by the reversed direction of the polarization fields in the quantum wells ( qws ) that constitute the active region of leds . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this fact should result in lower turn - on voltages and higher internal quantum efficiencies . unlike other epitaxial growth techniques , where the incorporation of high in contents is challenging due to the low decomposition efficiency of nh@xmath7 at reduced substrate temperatures,@xcite plasma - assisted molecular beam epitaxy ( pa - mbe ) facilitates the synthesis of in@xmath0ga@xmath1nalloys across the entire compositional range.@xcite    inspired by the potential advantages of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nalloys",
    ", @xcite demonstrated the pa - mbe growth of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nleds emitting at @xmath8  nm in 2011.@xcite however , in contrast to this encouraging work , some disconcerting results have been recently reported by @xcite who analyzed the optical properties of in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws grown by pa - mbe along the @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] directions . despite a comparable structural and morphological quality of their ga- and n - polar qws",
    ", the latter did not exhibit any detectable photoluminescence ( pl ) associated with the in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws .",
    "in contrast , an unclad _ thick _ ( 150  nm ) n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nlayer grown under identical conditions did show intense emission in the red spectral range .",
    "therefore , @xcite attributed the lack of luminescence in the n - polar qws to either surface - induced electric fields , causing carriers to escape from the qws and to subsequently recombine at the surface nonradiatively , or to a high concentration of non - radiative defects located at the interfaces between wells and barriers . the poor luminous efficiency of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nqws does not seem to be a specific problem of pa - mbe , but has also been reported for n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd).@xcite also for the case of mocvd , this phenomenon is not understood yet , but has been tentatively attributed to higher dislocation densities@xcite as well as to elevated residual impurity concentrations.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the luminescence of ga- and n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws to find a consistent explanation for the differences in their efficiencies .",
    "carrier escape and surface recombination is ruled out by combining simulations of the band profiles with pl measurements carried out with resonant excitation . to explore the remaining possibility , namely , the presence of a high concentration of nonradiative defects at the interfaces between wells and barriers , we analyze ga- and n - polar qws with different widths .",
    "the pl spectra of ga - polar qws exhibits the expected behavior , i.e. , it quenches and red - shifts with increasing qw width . for the n - polar samples , we observe an intense emission whose intensity and energy do not depend on the qw width .",
    "the analysis of the n - polar qws by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) reveal a random alloy composition and the absence of clustering .",
    "the anomalous behavior of the pl is thus not caused by the localization of excitons at alloy inhomogenities .",
    "the actual origin of the luminescence is clarified using spatially resolved cathodoluminescence ( cl ) spectroscopy .",
    "these measurements show that , regardless of the qw width , the luminescence does not arise from the n - polar qws themselves but from semipolar ones formed in @xmath4-pit defects .",

    "similar results were obtained for the other two qws ( not shown here for clarity ) .    for the n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws ( sample b ) , the electric field near the sample surface is stronger and of opposite direction compared to their ga - polar counterparts . in the cap layer ,",
    "electrons are thus pulled toward the surface and holes dragged into the qw region . due to the reverse direction of the piezoelectric fields , the direction of the electric field inside the qws is also opposite for samples a and b. because of this reason , electron and hole wave functions are localized at opposite qw / qb interfaces .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that the electron and hole ground states are well confined into the qws for both samples . to reach the surface ,",
    "both electrons and holes would have to overcome large barriers , particularly so for sample b. in fact , comparing the spatial extension of the wavefunctions , the confinement of both electrons and holes is seen to be significantly stronger in the qws of sample b as a result of the reversed fields and the higher in content ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "an escape of carriers from the qws seems hardly possible for sample a , but much less so for sample b.    finally , we note that the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions is about a factor of two larger for sample a as compared to sample b. this reduction in overlap , due to the slightly larger qw thickness as well as the stronger electric field caused by the higher in content , could explain a corresponding quenching of the luminous efficiency ( assuming an equally strong nonradiative participation in recombination ) , but certainly not the absolute lack of luminescence reported by @xcite      ( color online ) low - temperature ( 10  k ) -pl spectra under resonant excitation ( 413  nm ) of samples a and b. the samples were measured side - by - side with an excitation density of 200 and 2000  kw/@xmath47 for samples a and b , respectively . the sharp feature at 2.82ev for sample b originates from second order optical phonon scattering in the gan substrate .",
    "the spectra have been vertically shifted to line up their background in order to account for the different integration times used during the measurements . ]",
    "the low - temperature ( 10  k ) pl experiments reported by @xcite were performed using the @xmath48  nm line of a he - cd laser . for this wavelength , most carriers are not directly excited in the qws but in the cap layer and the surrounding qbs . the qw emission may then be suppressed by nonradiative recombination in the qb , competing with the capture of carriers by the qws . to exclude this possibility , we here examine the pl spectra of samples a and b obtained by _",
    "direct _ excitation at @xmath40  nm .    figure  [ pl1 ] shows the low - temperature pl spectra of samples a and b recorded with direct excitation . for sample",

    "the yellow band centered at @xmath50  ev stems from the gan substrate . for sample",
    "b , we observe only the yellow band at @xmath50  ev and a sharp feature at 2.82ev which originates from second order optical phonon scattering but no emission line which could be associated to the n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nqw .",
    "the results presented in the previous section demonstrate the presence of an efficient nonradiative recombination channel within n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws . because @xcite observed an intense luminescence from thick n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nlayers grown under similar conditions ( comparable to the intensity observed in ga - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws ) , the most plausible explanation for the lack of luminescence is a high concentration of nonradiative defects at the qw / qb interfaces . within the classical treatment of surface and interface recombination,@xcite and assuming a diffusion length much larger than the layer thickness",
    ", the nonradiative rate is expected to decrease linearly with the thickness of the layer . in the present case ,",

    "the in@xmath0ga@xmath1n - related cl signal is distributed rather uniformly over the entire surface .    the surface of the n - polar sample g [ fig .",
    "[ cl](b ) ] consists of flat and smooth @xmath11 facets separated by narrow trenches .",
    "in addition , a high density of @xmath4-pits are visible which are seen to have the shape of an inverted pyramid with semipolar facets .",
    "the superposition of the scanning electron micrograph with the monochromatic cl map reveals that the in@xmath0ga@xmath1n - related luminescence does not originate from the flat and smooth @xmath11 facets but from the semi - polar facets that constitute the @xmath4-pit defects .",
    "in fact , also in monochromatic imaging using other spectral windows or in spectrally resolved measurements on the @xmath11 facets ( not shown here ) , we did not observe any cl signal that could be ascribed to the n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws .",
    "the reduced piezo - electric field along semipolar directions@xcite partly explains the nonsystematic variation of the pl spectrum when increasing the qw width from sample g to j. in any case , the understanding of this variation is , at this point , only of secondary importance .",
    "the important result here is the lack of luminescence from the flat @xmath11 facets that correspond to the regions with well - defined n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws .",
    "this observation confirms the presence of a highly efficient nonradiative recombination channel within the flat regions of the qws .",
    "if n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws are to be used in light - emitting devices , the origin of this nonradiative channel has to be identified and eliminated .",
    "evidently , td can not be at the root of this nonradiative channel since the n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws studied in ref .",
    "have a td density of only @xmath63  @xmath14 , three orders of magnitude lower than samples g  j which were grown on sic substrates . yet , as seen in fig .",
    "[ pl1 ] , these samples were also found to exhibit no in@xmath0ga@xmath1n - related emission at all .",
    "misfit dislocations can not explain our results either because they were not observed in sample g. a higher concentration of nonradiative recombination centers in the bulk of the film , associated to the more efficient incorporation of impurities on the @xmath11 plane , is unlikely because @xcite observed an intense luminescence from thick n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nlayers grown under similar conditions as those used for qws .",
    "we thus believe that the most plausible explanation left is a high concentration of nonradiative point defects located at the qw / qb interfaces .",
    "in fact , it is known for other iii - v compound semiconductor heterostructures @xcite that point defects can segregate on the growth front , and may incorporate at the heterointerface due to the abrupt change of electrochemical potential .",
    "this mechanism is particular to a given surface , and may result in very high point defect densities at either the normal or the inverted interface between two materials .",
    "a high density of nonradiative point defects at either the in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3n@xmath11or the in@xmath2ga@xmath3n / in@xmath0ga@xmath1n@xmath11interface would be compatible with all experimental results reported in ref .   and the present work .    our results and those reported in ref .",
    "contrast with the successful fabrication of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nleds by @xcite however , these authors did not analyze the microscopic origin of the electroluminescence from their devices .",
    "the emission may thus have originated from semipolar qws formed around @xmath4-pits as observed in the present work or around hillocks as reported in ref .  .",
    "the unexpected luminescence quenching observed in n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws is not only relevant for the fabrication of leds in the form of films but is also of importance for the development of nano - leds based on spontaneously formed gan nanowires ( nws ) in pa - mbe . as discussed in refs .  , these nanostructures , if formed spontaneously in the absence of structural or morphological defects of the substrate , elongate along the @xmath5 $ ] direction .",
    "gan nws are thus n - polar and so are in@xmath0ga@xmath1nquantum disks inserted into them . yet ,",
    "numerous publications report on the luminescence of these n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1ndisks embedded into gan nanowires.@xcite while the luminous efficiency of these structures does not seem to be even close to that of planar ga - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nqws,@xcite they do luminesce in contrast to the planar qws studied in the present work .",
    "two essential differences between the in@xmath0ga@xmath1ndisks inserted in gan nws and corresponding planar structures may contribute to this fact : first , gan nws are formed under n excess,@xcite while planar qws are grown under metal - stable conditions .",
    "the resultingly different stoichiometry at the growth front may very well suppress the formation of nonradiative defects during the growth of the in@xmath0ga@xmath1nquantum discs .",
    "second , in@xmath0ga@xmath1ndisks in gan nws have been shown to exhibit large compositional fluctuations,@xcite inducing carrier localization which in turn may at least partly prevent nonradiative recombination .",
    "last but not least , we note that the conditions employed here and in ref .   for the growth of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws are those considered to be optimal for their ga - polar counterparts .",
    "these conditions result in an in - terminated surface which is essential for establishing a two - dimensional growth front on the @xmath10 surface , but may very well result in an enhanced generation of point defects on the @xmath11 surface .",
    "clearly , further studies are needed to investigate the impact of the surface stoichiometry during growth on the luminous efficiency of n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws . a promising route to improve the quality of n - polar qws consists in taking advantage of their higher thermal stability for exploring growth at substrate temperatures not achievable in the growth of ga - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n.@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the properties of ga- and n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws grown by pa - mbe under nominally identical conditions on different types of substrates .",
    "ga - polar qws exhibit a strong luminescence .",
    "both the energy and the intensity of the luminescence are largely determined by the qcse , and thus by the width of the qws .",
    "in contrast , regardless of the substrate as well as of the qw width , we did not observe luminescence from n - polar qws .",
    "the simulation of the band profiles together with pl measurements carried out with resonant excitation point toward the presence of a very efficient nonradiative recombination channel within the qws . because the luminescence quenching is not observed in thick n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1nlayers , the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is the incorporation of a high density of nonradiative defects at the interfaces between qws and qbs .",
    "the present results demonstrate that the optimized growth conditions for the fabrication of ga - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws are not suitable for the synthesis of equivalent structures along the opposite direction . in order to take advantage of the potential benefits of the @xmath5 $ ] orientation for the fabrication of green leds ,",
    "it is necessary to develop novel growth approaches designed to eliminate the nonradiative defects in n - polar in@xmath0ga@xmath1n / in@xmath2ga@xmath3nqws .",
