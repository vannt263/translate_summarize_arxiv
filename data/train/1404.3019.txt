    "the pairing correlation plays an essential role in many phenomena of atomic nuclei @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the dineutron and diproton correlations have particularly attracted a lot of interests in connection to the physics of unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "these are correlations induced by the pairing interaction , with which two nucleons are spatially localized . since the pairing gap in infinite nuclear matter takes a maximum at the density lower than the normal density @xcite , the dinucleon correlation is enhanced on the surface of nuclei .",
    "this property may also be related to the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "although the dinucleon correlation has been theoretically predicted for some time , it is still an open issue to probe it experimentally . for this purpose , a pair - transfer reaction @xcite and the electro - magnetic excitations @xcite",
    "may be considered . however , even though there have been a few experimental indications @xcite , so far no direct experimental evidence for the dinucleon correlation has been found , mainly due to a difficulty to access the intrinsic structures in bound nuclei without disturbing with an external field .",
    "this difficulty may be overcome by using two - proton ( - ) emission decays ( these are referred to as two - proton radio - activities when the decay width is sufficiently small ) of nuclei outside the proton drip - line @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of the -emission is that two protons are emitted spontaneously from the ground state of unbound nuclei , and thus they are expected to carry information on the pairing correlations inside nuclei , including the diproton correlation @xcite .",
    "the -radioactivity was predicted for the first time by goldansky @xcite .",
    "he introduced the concept of the `` true -decay '' , which takes place in the situation where the emission of single proton is energetically forbidden .",
    "the pairing interaction plays an important role to generate such a situation , lowering the energy of even - z nuclei . in the true -decay process",
    ", the two protons may be emitted simultaneously as a diproton , that is , the diproton decay @xcite .",
    "this process should thus intimately be related to the diproton correlation .",
    "since the time of goldansky , there has been an enormous progress in the problem of -decays , both experimentally and theoretically , and our understanding of the -decays has been considerably improved@xcite .",
    "it has been considered now that the actual -decays are often much more complicated than the simple diproton decays which goldansky originally proposed @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has not been completely clarified whether the diproton correlation can be actually probed by observing -decays .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the role of the diproton correlation in -emissions , and discuss a possibility of probing the diproton correlation through the -decays . for this purpose",
    ", one needs to handle a many - body meta - stable state , for which the theoretical frameworks can be categorized into two approaches : the time - independent framework @xcite and the time - dependent framework @xcite . in the time - independent approach",
    ", the decay state is regarded as a pure outgoing state with a complex energy , that is , the gamow state .",
    "the real and the imaginary parts of the complex energy are related to the decay energy and width , respectively .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the decay width can be accurately calculated even when the width is extremely small @xcite . in the time - dependent framework , on the other hand , the quantum decay of a metastable state is treated as a time - evolution of a wave packet @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the decay dynamics can be intuitively understood by monitoring the time - evolution of the wave packet .",
    "these two approaches are thus complementary to each other .    in this paper , we employ the time - dependent approach .",
    "this approach has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to study one - proton emission decays of proton - rich nuclei . in our previous work @xcite , we extended this approach to -emission in one - dimension .",
    "we here apply this method to a realistic system , that is , the ground state of the @xmath0be nucleus , by assuming the three - body structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0be nucleus is the lightest -emitter , where the -emission decay from its ground state has been experimentally studied in refs .",
    "the experimental q - value of the -emission is @xmath2 mev @xcite , while the @xmath3li nucleus is unbound by 1.96(5 ) mev from the threshold of @xmath4 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:001 ] .",
    "although the @xmath3li nucleus has a large resonance width of about 1.5 mev @xcite , the @xmath0be nucleus is considered to be a true -emitter . therefore , the sequential decay via the @xmath5 subsystem plays a minor role , and the effect of the diproton correlation , due to the pairing correlation , may significantly be revealed .",

    "the diproton emission is a special case of the first category .",
    "the second category corresponds to the case where only one proton penetrates the barrier .",
    "[ fig:80](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the simultaneous -emissions with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively , where @xmath144 ( fig.[fig:80](a ) ) corresponds to the diproton emission . in these three cases ,",
    "the density in the @xmath158-plane shows the same patterns , and is concentrated along @xmath159 .",
    "the simultaneous emissions with different opening angles can be distinguished only in the @xmath160-plane : for instance , in the diproton emission , the probability shows mainly along the line with @xmath161 , while it is along the line with @xmath162 for @xmath163 . in the one - proton emission shown in fig.[fig:80](d ) , only one of the two protons goes through the barrier while the other proton remains inside the core nucleus .",
    "this is seen as the increment along @xmath164 and @xmath109 or @xmath165 lines .    in fig . [ fig:80](e ) and ( f ) , we illustrate two hybrid processes . the first one is a `` correlated emission '' , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:80](e ) . in the correlated emission ,",
    "the two protons are emitted simultaneously to almost the same direction , holding the diproton - like configuration . in this mode , in the early stage of tunneling , the density distribution has a larger amplitude in the region with @xmath166 and small @xmath111 . in the @xmath160-plane , it corresponds to the increment of the probability in the region of @xmath167 .",
    "after the barrier penetration , the two protons separate from each other mainly due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the second hybrid process is a `` sequential emission '' , which is shown in fig . [",
    "fig:80](f ) . in this mode",
    ", there is a large possibility in which one proton is emitted whereas the other proton remains around the core .",
    "the density distribution shows high peaks along @xmath168 and @xmath169 . in the @xmath160-plane",
    ", it corresponds to the increment along the line of @xmath164 .",
    "in contrast to the pure one - proton emission , the remaining proton eventually goes through the barrier when the core - proton subsystem is unbound .",
    "we now show the results of the time - dependent calculations for the -emission of @xmath0be .",
    "we first discuss the case of full configuration - mixture , where the odd-@xmath44 and even-@xmath44 single particle states are fully mixed by the pairing correlation .",
    "the density distribution for the decay state along the time - evolution is shown in fig .",

    ", we normalize @xmath153 at each step of time .    in the left and middle columns of fig .",

    "it should also be noted that , after the barrier penetration , the two protons lose their diproton - like configuration due to the coulomb repulsion , which results in the increase of @xmath152 .",
    "thus , for @xmath173 fm which is a typical position of the potential barrier from the core , the density distribution extends around the @xmath174 region . in this process",
    ", the pairing correlation plays an important role to generate the significant diproton - like configuration before the end of the barrier penetration . in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig:81 ] , the distributions are also displayed as a function of the opening angle , @xmath111 .",
    "we can clearly see that the decay state has a high peak at @xmath175 in this time - region .",
    "these results imply that the two protons are emitted almost in the same direction , at least in the early stage of the emission process .",
    "intuitively , from the uncertainty principle , this would correspond to a large opening angle in the momentum space .",
    "indeed , such component has been experimentally observed to be dominant for the -decay of @xmath104be @xcite .",
    "it would be an interesting future work to carry out the fourier transformation of the decay state and compare our calculations with the experimental data .",
    "we next discuss the case only with @xmath95 bases . in fig .",

    "[ fig:80](f ) : significant increments occur along the lines with @xmath164 and @xmath168 or @xmath169 . notice that the contribution from the simultaneous emissions also exists , especially in the early time - region . as a result",
    ", the decay state has widely spread amplitudes as a mixture of these emission modes .",
    "however , the simultaneous mode is minor compared with the case of full configuration - mixture .",
    "notice that the condition for a true -emitter is satisfied also in this case : the core - proton resonance is located at @xmath176 mev which is above @xmath177 mev .",
    "however , even with the strong pairing attraction and the energy condition for the true -emitter , the process hardly becomes the correlated emission when the parity - mixing is forbidden or extensively suppressed .",
    "the angular distribution shows exactly the symmetric form , and is almost invariant during the time - evolution .",

    ", we only consider the uncorrelated hamiltonian , @xmath178 . because of the absence of the non - diagonal components in the hamiltonian matrix",
    ", it can be proved that , if the s.p .",
    "resonance is at an energy @xmath179 with its width @xmath180 , the -resonance is at @xmath181 with its width @xmath182 .",

    ", we inevitably modify the core - proton potential .",
    "we employ @xmath184 mev to yield the s.p .",
    "resonance at @xmath185 mev , although the scattering data for the core - proton subsystem are not reproduced and the character of a true -emitter disappears . with this potential",
    ", we obtain the s.p .",
    "resonance with a broad width : @xmath186 kev .",
    "because of the broad decay width , we need to increase the radial box to @xmath187 fm in order to neglect the artifact due to the reflection at @xmath188 in the long time - evolution .",
    "the result for the decay width is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 - 3 ] and in the last row of table [ tb:2 ] . to get the saturated result",
    ", we somewhat need a relatively longer time - evolution than that in the case of full configuration - mixture .",
    "thus , in table [ tb:2 ] , we evaluate the decay width at @xmath143 fm . by this time",

    "resonance , @xmath190 . during the time - interval shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 - 3 ] , there still remain some oscillations in @xmath84 .",
    "this is a characteristic behavior of the broad resonance , namely an oscillatory deviation from the exponential decay - rule . for the spin - singlet and triplet configurations , their contributions have exactly the ratio of @xmath191 .",
    "this result is simply due to the re - coupling of the angular momentum for the @xmath98 configuration . by comparing these results with those in the case of the full configuration - mixing",
    ", we can clearly see a decisive role of the pairing correlations in -emissions .",
    "assuming the empirical q - value , if we explicitly consider the pairing correlations , the decay width becomes narrow and agrees with the experimental data . on the other hand , in the no - pairing case",
    ", we need a modified core - proton interaction to reproduce the empirical q - value , and the properties of the core - proton resonance state become inconsistent with the experimental data .",
    "even though the q - value is adjusted in this way , the calculated -decay width is significantly overestimated in this case .",
    "namely , we can not simultaneously reproduce the experimental q - value and the decay width with the no - pairing assumption .",
    "if one is forced to reproduce them simultaneously , one may need an unphysical core - proton interactions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:83 ] , we show the density distribution of the decay state during the time - evolution . obviously , in this case , the process is the sequential or , moreover , like the one - proton emission .",
    "there is a significant increase of the density along the lines with @xmath164 and , consistently , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:80 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability for the simultaneous and correlated emissions are negligibly small .",
    "this is quite different from that in the case of full configuration - mixture , where the correlated emission is apparent .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss a general role of the pairing correlation in the -emission . to this end",
    ", we calculate the -decay width for different q - values in the case of full configuration - mixture and the no - pairing case .",
    "the variation of the q - value is done by changing the parameter @xmath192 in the core - proton potential ( eq.([eq : cp - ws ] ) ) , while the pairing interaction used in the case of full configuration mixture is kept unchanged .",
    "notice that for the no - pairing case , the s.p .",
    "resonance appears at @xmath193 .",
    "c    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5qp ] , the decay width is plotted as a function of the decay q - value .",
    "we note that the calculated decay widths are well converged after a sufficient time - evolution in all the cases .",
    "the decay width is evaluated at @xmath148 and @xmath194 fm in the full - correlation and the no - pairing cases , respectively . clearly , the no - pairing calculations overestimate the decay width , in all the region of @xmath195 .",
    "namely , the three - body system becomes easier to decay without the pairing correlation , for the same value of the total energy release ( q - value ) .",
    "in other words , the pairing correlation plays an essential role in the meta - stable state , stabilizing it against particle emissions .",
    "we note that a similar effect has been predicted also for a one - neutron resonance , that is , the width of a one - neutron resonance becomes narrow when one considers the pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "also , as we have confirmed in the previous section , the emission dynamics with and without the pairing correlations are essentially different to each other : the correlated emission becomes dominant if the pairing correlation is fully considered , whereas the sequential emission plays a major role in the no - pairing case .",
    "consequently , the pairing correlation must be treated explicitly in the meta - stable states , otherwise one would miss the essential effect on both the decay - rule and the dynamical phenomena .",
    "we have investigated the -emission of the @xmath0be nucleus by employing a three - body model consisting of an @xmath6 particle and two valence protons .",
    "we have applied the time - dependent method and discussed the decay dynamics of many - body meta - stale states , particularly in connection to the diproton correlation .",
    "an advantage of the time - dependent method is that it provides not only a way to evaluate the decay width , but also an intuitive way to understand the decay dynamics .    by using the confining potential method",
    ", we first obtained the initial state of @xmath0be , in which the two protons are confined inside the potential barrier . because of the pairing correlation between the two protons , the initial configuration includes the diproton correlation , similarly to the dineutron correlation in the ground states of borromean nuclei such as @xmath0he . at time @xmath71 , the confinement is removed so that the -state evolves in space and time . in this calculation , the decay width can be read off by plotting the survival probability as a function of time .",
    "we have found that our hamiltonian well reproduces simultaneously the experimental q - value and decay width of @xmath0be .",
    "we have also shown that the decay state predominantly has the spin - singlet configuration .    by monitoring the time - evolution of the density distribution of the decay state , we have confirmed that the decay process in the early stage is mainly the correlated emission , in which the two protons tend to be emitted in a similar direction , reflecting the diproton correlation in the initial state .",
    "thus , the -emission can be a promising tool to probe experimentally the diproton correlation .",
    "we have also performed the calculations by including only odd-@xmath44 partial waves in order to switch off the diproton correlation . in this case , even though we use the model parameters which reproduce the empirical q - value , the decay width is significantly underestimated .",
    "the decay process shows a large component of the sequential emission , in contrast to the case of full configuration - mixture . from these results ,",
    "we can conclude that the diproton correlation plays an important role in the -emission , providing an opportunity to probe it by observing the -emission .",
    "we have also checked that , if the pairing correlation is completely neglected , the decay width is largely overestimated , partly because the proton - core potential has to be made deeper in order to yield the empirical q - value . by monitoring the time - evolution of the density distribution of the decay state",
    ", it has been clarified that the emission is mostly a sequential decay with the no - pairing assumption .",
    "namely , the pairing correlation is critically important to determine not only the decay width but also the dynamical phenomena .    in order to compare quantitatively the calculated results with the experimental data",
    ", we would need a more careful treatment of the final - state interactions ( fsis ) . in this work",
    ", we mainly treat the early stage of the time - evolution , terminating the calculations at @xmath196 fm in order to avoid the artifact due to the reflection at the edge of the box , @xmath188 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two protons are detected in the actual experiments at a much later time after being significantly affected by the fsis . in order to fully take into account the fsis",
    ", we would have to use an extremely large box even though the computational costs would increase severely .    the time - dependent method which we employed in this paper",
    "can be applied also to a decay of other many - body meta - stable states .",
    "it provides a novel and intuitive point of view to the decay process .",
    "it would be an interesting future problem to apply this method to other problems of many - particle quantum decays , such as the two - neutron emission and the two - electron auto - ionization of atoms .",
