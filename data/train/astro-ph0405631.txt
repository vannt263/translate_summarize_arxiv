    "translated to the language of polynomials , chs s motivating goal ( see eqn .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite ) was to factor every homogeneous harmonic polynomial @xmath9 of degree @xmath3 into a product of linear factors @xmath10 such a factorization is of course impossible in general , as chs implicitly acknowledge by their introduction of suitable error terms . in the language of polynomials the correct statement of the theorem is    0.25 cm    _ * theorem 1 . * every homogeneous polynomial @xmath9 of degree @xmath3 in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be written as _",

    "_    0.25 cm    note : corollary 2 does not require the polynomial @xmath9 to be either homogeneous or harmonic .",

    "_ write @xmath9 as a sum of homogeneous terms @xmath19 .",
    "first apply theorem  1 to the highest order term @xmath20 , yielding a factorization @xmath21 along with a remainder term @xmath22 of homogeneous degree @xmath12 .",
    "( the factor @xmath23 may be ignored on the unit sphere . )",
    "fold @xmath24 in with @xmath25 , and proceed recursively , applying theorem  1 to @xmath26 , then @xmath25 , and so on .    to prove uniqueness ,",
    "consider the even and odd parts of @xmath9 separately .",
    "that is , write @xmath27 , where @xmath28 contains all the even - powered terms and @xmath29 contains all the odd - powered terms .",
    "say we have two potentially different decompositions for the even part @xmath30 where each @xmath31 is the @xmath32 term in a decomposition ( [ corollary2 ] ) , and where the leading index will be @xmath3 or @xmath33 according to whether @xmath3 is even or odd . to make these decompositions homogeneous , multiply through by appropriate powers of @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35 this does not affect the value of @xmath9 on the unit sphere , because @xmath36 there .",
    "the uniqueness part of theorem  1 implies that the leading order terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 must be equal .",
    "so subtract off those leading terms , divide through by @xmath39 , and apply theorem  1 again to conclude @xmath40 .",
    "continue recursively to finally reach @xmath41 .",
    "the same argument then proves that the odd part of @xmath9 has a unique decomposition as well . q.e.d .",
    "even though the statement of theorem 1 lives wholly in the world of real polynomials , its proof will dive deeply into the world of complex polynomials .",
    "so let the variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 range over the complex numbers , while insisting that the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath9 remain real . because @xmath9 has homogeneous degree @xmath3 , whenever one point @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 , every nonzero constant multiple @xmath44 satisfies it as well .",
    "thus the equation @xmath45 is well defined on each equivalence class of points @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "the complex curve @xmath45 is well defined on the complex projective plane @xmath47 , which is the quotient of @xmath48 under the equivalence relation @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "this leads us into the realm of algebraic geometry and puts its powerful tools at our disposal .",
    "the most useful tool for our purposes is    0.25 cm    _ * bzout s theorem . * if @xmath9 and @xmath39 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , then the curves @xmath45 and @xmath54 intersect in @xmath47 _    * in exactly @xmath55 points , counted with multiplicity , if @xmath9 and @xmath39 share no common factor , or * in infinitely many points , if @xmath9 and @xmath39 do share a common factor .    for an elementary exposition of bzout s theorem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "0.25 cm    in the present case , the only way the polynomial @xmath9 may share a factor with the irreducible polynomial @xmath56 is for @xmath9 to contain @xmath39 as a factor , in which case theorem  1 is trivially satisfied ( take @xmath57 ) .",
    "so henceforth assume @xmath9 does not contain @xmath39 as a factor .",
    "bzout s theorem now tells us that the degree @xmath3 complex curve @xmath58 intersects the quadratic curve @xmath59 in exactly @xmath60 points , counted with multiplicities .",
    "none of the intersection points may be purely real , because real values can not possibly satisfy @xmath61  recall that the definition of @xmath47 explicitly excludes @xmath62 . furthermore , because @xmath9 and @xmath39 both have real coefficients , whenever @xmath42 lies in the intersection @xmath63 , its complex conjugate @xmath64 must lie there too .",
    "so the @xmath60 points of intersection consist of @xmath3 pairs of non - real complex conjugates @xmath65 .",
    "we claim that each pair @xmath66 determines a unique line @xmath67 with real coefficients .",
    "the proof is easy .",
    "the conjugate pair @xmath66 lies on the line @xmath67 if and only if the real and imaginary parts satisfy the following two totally real equations @xmath68 geometrically those two equations represent planes in @xmath69 .",
    "if the coefficient vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are non - collinear , then the two planes are distinct and their intersection , which defines the solution set for @xmath72 , is a line through the origin in @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the line @xmath67 is unique .",
    "normalize the coefficients to unit length , i.e. @xmath73 , and the only remaining ambiguity is an overall factor of @xmath74 .",
    "but what if the coefficient vectors @xmath75 = @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 = @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 had been collinear ? in this case",
    "the line @xmath67 would be ill - defined .",
    "fortunately this case does not arise . for",
    "if @xmath79 were proportional to @xmath75 , say @xmath83 , then the point @xmath84 , as an element of @xmath47 , could be rewritten as a scalar multiple @xmath85 , showing that @xmath84 is totally real .",
    "in other words , @xmath84 would lie in @xmath86 .",
    "in particular , @xmath84 would be its own complex conjugate , and we can hardly expect a single point @xmath87 to determine a unique line . fortunately this case can not occur , because @xmath88 admits no real solutions .",
    "so let @xmath89 denote the unique line @xmath67 containing the conjugate pair @xmath66 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath90 be the unique ( modulo rescaling ) real linear polynomial whose roots include both @xmath84 and @xmath91 .",
    "the desired decomposition ( [ maintheoremequation ] ) becomes @xmath92 to prove that this equality holds , we again turn to bzout s theorem .",
    "first recall that the complex curve @xmath45 intersects the complex curve @xmath54 in precisely the @xmath60 points @xmath93 . by construction",
    ", the product curve @xmath94 also intersects @xmath54 in those same @xmath60 points , and by bzout s theorem there are no other points of intersection .",
    "now pick any other point @xmath95 and define @xmath96 to be the ratio @xmath97 write a new polynomial @xmath98 this new polynomial @xmath99 has degree @xmath3 , yet has zeros at the @xmath100 distinct points @xmath101 . in other words ,",
    "the complex curve @xmath102 intersects the complex curve @xmath54 at ( at least ) @xmath100 distinct points . by bzout s theorem the polynomials @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath39 must share a common factor ; because @xmath39 is irreducible the common factor must perforce be @xmath39 itself .",
    "thus we may factor @xmath99 as @xmath103 for some remainder term @xmath13 . combining ( [ definitionoff ] ) and ( [ factorization ] ) yields the desired decomposition ( [ maintheoremequationbis ] ) .",
    "let us now prove that @xmath96 is real . in light of the factorization ( [ factorization ] ) ,",
    "the polynomial @xmath99 is clearly zero on the whole complex curve @xmath54 . in particular , for the point @xmath104 chosen earlier , @xmath105 on the one hand @xmath106 on the other hand , because @xmath9 and the @xmath89 all have real coefficients , @xmath107 comparing ( [ step1 ] ) , ( [ step2 ] ) and ( [ step3 ] ) , and recalling that @xmath104 was chosen to ensure @xmath108 , proves that @xmath109 , in other words , @xmath96 is real .",
    "an elementary argument then shows that for all real values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath110 = @xmath111 = @xmath112 , implying that the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath13 must all be real .",
    "this completes the proof of the existence part of theorem  1 .",
    "0.5 cm    let us now prove that the decomposition ( [ maintheoremequation ] ) is unique .",
    "assume we have two decompositions @xmath113 our goal is to show that each linear factor @xmath114 in the second decomposition occurs as a factor @xmath89 in the first decomposition as well , modulo a possible rescaling . a given line @xmath115 intersects the quadratic @xmath54 in a pair of conjugate points @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "because @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfy both @xmath115 and @xmath54 , they satisfy @xmath45 as well . turning our attention to the first decomposition , because @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfy both @xmath45 and @xmath54 , they satisfy @xmath94 as well .",
    "hence @xmath116 must satisfy one of the lines @xmath118 , and because the line s coefficients are real , @xmath117 must satisfy that same line .",
    "but we saw earlier that a pair of conjugate points @xmath116 and @xmath117 determines a unique line modulo normalization ( recall the essentially unique solution to equations  ( [ lineequations ] ) ) .",
    "therefore @xmath89 is a constant multiple of @xmath114 , and if the coefficients of each have been normalized to length one , then @xmath119 .",
    "this proves the uniqueness of the factorization .    if we evaluate the two decompositions  ( [ twodecompositions ] ) on the complex curve @xmath54 we get @xmath120 proving that if the coefficients of the @xmath89 and the @xmath114 are consistently normalized , then @xmath121 .",
    "it then follows easily that @xmath122 as well .",
    "this completes the proof that the decomposition ( [ maintheoremequation ] ) is unique , thus completing the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "the proof presented in section  [ sectionproof ] is almost constructive , but not quite .",
    "it relies on bzout s theorem for the existence of the root pairs @xmath123 but does not say how to find them .",
    "this section fills the gap .",
    "the key observation is that the quadratic curve @xmath124 is topologically a 2-sphere .",
    "more to the point , it is a copy of the complex projective line @xmath125 , which happens to be homeomorphic to the 2-sphere .",
    "let us parameterize the curve @xmath54 as @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are homogeneous coordinates in @xmath125 .",
    "clearly the mapping ( [ parameterization ] ) takes all points @xmath129 to the curve @xmath54 , by construction .",
    "the question is , which of those points happen to satisfy the given polynomial @xmath9 as well ?",
    "write @xmath130 to express @xmath9 as a function on @xmath125 .    if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 and @xmath133 represent the same point in @xmath125 .",
    "if we define @xmath134 then expression ( [ poncp1 ] ) effectively reduces to a polynomial in a single variable , @xmath135 the roots of this polynomial are the desired root pairs @xmath93 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath136 , then @xmath137 . thus @xmath138 may represent an additional root , which would not be found as a root of @xmath139 in ( [ poncp1bis ] ) .",
    "once we have found the parameters @xmath132 for all @xmath60 roots of @xmath9 , the easiest way to group them into conjugate pairs is to observe that the parameterization ( [ parameterization ] ) maps `` antipodal points '' @xmath140 to conjugate points @xmath141 . in other words , @xmath142 and @xmath143 map to a pair of conjugate points in @xmath47 .",
    "to illustrate how the algorithm works in practice , let us apply theorem  1 to several concrete examples .",
    "consider the quadratic polynomial @xmath144    first dismiss the special case @xmath138 by noting that the parameterization  ( [ parameterization ] ) maps @xmath138 to @xmath145 for which ( [ example1 ] ) gives @xmath146 .",
    "now consider the general case , for which equation  ( [ poncp1bis ] ) becomes @xmath147 with roots @xmath148 corresponding , respectively , to the four points of @xmath47 , @xmath149 solving the line equations  ( [ lineequations ] ) converts the preceding two pairs of conjugate points to the two lines @xmath150 which give us the two multipole vectors @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    to find the correct @xmath96 , evaluate equation  ( [ definitionlambda ] ) for , say , @xmath153 , giving @xmath154",
    "of course any other choice for @xmath104 would have given the same answer @xmath155 , just so we make sure @xmath104 lies on the curve @xmath156 and exclude @xmath157 .",
    "we may now write down the polynomial @xmath99 from equation  [ definitionoff ] , namely @xmath158 and divide by @xmath34 to get the remainder term @xmath159 . thus the final decomposition promised by theorem 1 becomes @xmath160      the cubic polynomial @xmath161 illustrates some non - generic behavior which may arise , namely the possibilities of _ ( a ) _ a `` missing root '' and _ ( b ) _ multiple roots .",
    "we will follow the same algorithm as in section  [ subsectiontoyquadrupole ] , pointing out only the differences .",
    "the first difference is that the special case @xmath138 , corresponding to @xmath145 , is indeed a root of @xmath9 in ( [ example2 ] ) .",
    "so we record that root and proceed onward in search of the other roots .",
    "the next difference we encounter is that the polynomial @xmath162 has degree only 5 , not degree @xmath163 as one expects in the generic case .",
    "happily , this polynomial s five roots supplement the one exceptional root @xmath164 we found in the previous paragraph , to give the required total of six roots .",
    "in other words , the unexpectedly low degree of the polynomial is intimately tied to the existence of the exceptional root @xmath164 .",
    "the roots of ( [ alpha2 ] ) turn out to be @xmath165 . unlike more generic polynomials",
    ", this one has multiple roots , implying a repeated factor in the product @xmath166 .",
    "specifically , those five roots correspond to @xmath167 and then the one exceptional root @xmath164 completes the pattern @xmath168    from here the algorithm is routine .",
    "the lines are @xmath169 the scalar multiple is @xmath170 , and the final factorization is @xmath171      our first task here is to convert a given set of coefficients @xmath172 to a homogeneous harmonic polynomial . converting the standard spherical harmonics @xmath173 to polynomials in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is easy .",
    "for example , for the quadrupole , @xmath174 using the coefficients @xmath175 for the dq - corrected tegmark map of the first - year wmap quadrupole gives @xmath176 following the same algorithm , as illustrated in sections [ subsectiontoyquadrupole ] and [ subsectiontoyoctopole ] , we get the polynomial @xmath177 leading to the lines @xmath178 converting the coefficients of these lines to spherical coordinates gives multipole vectors @xmath179 in full agreement with those that chs found using their tensor algorithm ( equation  3 of @xcite ) .    an analogous computation for the octopole yields multipole vectors @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , again in full agreement with those reported in equation  3 of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we define the _ quadrupole plane _ normal vector @xmath183 and the three _ octopole plane _",
    "normal vectors @xmath184 still following @xcite , we judge the alignment of the quadrupole plane with the three octopole planes via the dot products @xmath185 finally , in contrast to @xcite ( which in its preprint form contained some statistical flaws ) , we let the sum @xmath186 provide a numerical measure of how well the quadrupole plane aligns with the octopole planes . for the dq - corrected tegmark map",
    ", the sum evaluates to @xmath187 .    to judge how unusually large @xmath188 is , we evaluated @xmath189 for 100000 random quadrupoles and octopoles , and found that only 118 trials produced @xmath190 .",
    "this 99.9% confidence level , while weaker than the incorrectly stated results of @xcite , is completely consistent with huterer and starkman s revised statistical analysis @xcite .    like schwarz , starkman , huterer and copi",
    ", we find this result astonishing .",
    "in particular we find it difficult to believe that the quadrupole and octopole align so well merely by chance .",
    "whether the alignment is imposed by the global topology of a small finite universe , or whether it is due to some previously unknown solar system effect , or whether it is merely the result of an error in the collection and/or processing of the wmap data , remains to be seen .    in the meantime",
    ", we emphasize that our simulations use an entirely different algorithm from that of @xcite as well as completely independent computer code .",
    "this effectively rules out the possibility of error in computing the 1-in-1000 estimate , forcing us to take that estimate quite seriously .",
    "we should point out that our monte carlo simulations chose random quadrupoles and octopoles independently of each other , relative to spherically symmetric distributions on the spaces of all spherical harmonics of degree 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in other words , we used independent gaussian coefficients @xmath172 .",
    "corollary 2 motivates a broader question , first raised by copi , huterer and starkman @xcite . one would like to decompose an arbitrary real - valued function @xmath191 , for example the temperature function on the microwave sky , as a sum @xmath192 . in other words ,",
    "this approach would bypass the spherical harmonics entirely , and instead write the function @xmath193 directly as the sum of totally factored polynomials @xmath194 , one for each degree @xmath3 .",
    "corollary 2 almost makes such a factorization possible .",
    "for example , if we approximate the microwave sky temperature by the sum of its first 837 multipoles , @xmath195 , then corollary  2 lets us re - express it as @xmath196 .",
    "the question is , what happens when we add in the @xmath197 spherical harmonic ?",
    "for sure we will add an @xmath197 term @xmath198 to our factored - polynomial decomposition . and almost surely the @xmath199 term will change significantly as it inherits the remainder @xmath13 from the newly added @xmath197 term .",
    "but what about the lower order terms",
    "? will the second , fourth and sixth terms remain stable ? or will they swing wildly every time we add a new high - order term to the series ?",
