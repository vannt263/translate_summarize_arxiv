    "the detection of cosmic neutrinos poses great challenges , but has attractive features as well .",
    "as opposed to other particles and to electromagnetic radiation , neutrinos can travel through huge amounts of matter without being absorbed .",
    "they can thus lead to the discovery of distant production sites hidden from observation with conventional means .",
    "furthermore , they do not get deflected by magnetic fields during their journey and so their path points straight back to their point of origin .",
    "some known extra - terrestrial sources that are believed to accelerate particles to very high energies are prime candidates for neutrino production . in that scenario , neutrinos are produced as a result of the interaction of accelerated charged particles with surrounding matter or photons , producing pions , which themselves decay into muons and neutrinos . the actual observation of neutrinos would thus shed light on the hadronic nature of the accelerating process .",
    "the energy feeding that process is of gravitational origin and possible candidates are active galactic nuclei ( agns),supernova remnants ( snrs ) or gamma ray bursters ( grbs ) .",
    "models predict a hard energy spectrum @xmath0 , which at high enough energies has a flux detectable above the background of the much steeper atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "another possible scheme for neutrino production is one where neutrinos come from the decay of massive relic particles @xcite .",
    "high energy neutrinos interact via charged and neutral currents with ordinary matter and produce charged particles in the process .",
    "these particles in turn send out cherenkov light when they travel through a medium with a refractive index greater than one . in order to detect the weakly interacting neutrino , large volumes of matter",
    "must be instrumented with light sensors . in the cases of amanda and icecube",
    ", the ice sheet at the south pole serves as the cherenkov medium .",
    "notice , that the clarity of this ice allows for a sparse instrumentation , reducing the cost of the detector for a given geometry .",
    "muon neutrinos produce long range secondary muons ( 1 km at 200 gev ) sending out light along their path through the detector .",
    "the direction of the parent neutrino can be directly inferred from that of the muon since the mean angle between the two particles is proportional to @xmath1 , with a value of of @xmath2 at 1 tev .",
    "electron and tau neutrinos will produce cascades , reconstructed as point sources using the cherenkov light , but from which some directional information can be extracted as well . the main background to these events comes from atmospheric muons produced in the atmosphere above the detector , so only events reconstructed as up - going are considered as signal , since atmospheric muons from this direction get absorbed by the earth . at pev energies ,",
    "the earth becomes opaque to neutrinos , including the background made by those produced in the atmosphere and one has to look for events coming from close to the horizon and above . at those energies",
    ", the @xmath3 has a characteristic `` double bang '' signature : after the first cascade , produced when the @xmath3 interacts with the ice , the resulting tau particle decays after hundreds of meters , producing a second cascade .",
    "thus the topologies of the three neutrino flavors become quite distinguishable @xcite .    _ , height=377 ]",
    "amanda is an array of light sensors installed deep in the 2800 meter thick south pole ice sheet . over the years",
    ", 19 holes have been melted with a hot - water drill and optical modules ( oms ) were frozen - in at depths between 1500 and 2000 m below the surface .",
    "the oms are arranged string - wise , with a distance between them of 10 to 20 meters , depending on their location .",
    "each module consists of an 8-inch hamamatsu photomultiplier , enclosed in a thick glass sphere designed to stand the high pressure of the ice .",
    "there are 677 oms arranged on 19 strings in total , deployed between 1996 and 2000 .",
    "the signals produced by the photomultipliers travel along cables , connected to a counting house at the surface . after triggering , time- and charge - information",
    "is extracted from these pulses and stored for further analysis .",
    "spase - ii is an air - shower array located at the surface of the ice and operated in coincidence with amanda .",

    "we present here only a selection of results .",
    "several topics are not included here , such as : grb searches , detection and search for gravitational collapse supernovae , search for exotic particle ( q - balls , nuclearites , monopoles etc . )      cosmic rays impinging on the atmosphere produce up - going neutrinos which are indistinguishable from extra - terrestrial neutrinos .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the flux of the first goes as @xmath4 above 1 tev , in contrast to the flux of the latter which is expected to vary as @xmath5 and thus decrease much faster with energy .",
    "the energy spectrum of the year 2000 data with 570 neutrino events was extracted using neural net techniques and then unfolded @xcite . the ( preliminary ) result",
    "is shown in figure [ unfolded ] , together with the frejus measurements @xcite at lower energies .",
    "amanda has performed the first measurements going up to 300 tev .",
    "both the frejus and the amanda results lie within the horizontal and vertical fluxes parametrized by volkova ( @xmath6 gev ) and honda ( @xmath7 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the maximum additional flux with an @xmath5 spectrum ( at a @xmath8 confidence level ) in the range 100 - 300 tev is also marked ( `` limit '' ) on the figure .",

    "background simulations tell us that the probability of observing an excess @xmath11 , taking into account trial factors , is @xmath12 . a selective search for an excess from a list of 33 pre - selected sources does not lead to the discovery of any significant excess either .    _ , width=377 ]    _ , width=377 ]      _ , width=377 ]    even if the fluxes from individual objects are too low to be detected separately from each other , the combined flux of many such sources may still be used to offer evidence of the production of extra - terrestrial neutrinos . if that diffuse flux exists",
    ", it is expected to have a harder spectrum than that of atmospheric neutrinos and will be exceeding it above a high enough energy .",
    "figure [ diffuse ] shows the limits set by amanda and other detectors on diffuse neutrinos : the limit labeled ( 1 ) is the one set by macro @xcite , ( 2 ) is from the 10-string stage of amanda in 1997 using @xmath9 @xcite , ( 3 ) comes from the same data as ( 2 ) but the analysis combines all flavors of uhe @xmath13s@xcite .

    ", we enter the era of cubic kilometer sized neutrino telescopes . at completion , it will consist of 80 strings arranged on a regular hexagon and with 60 digital optical modules ( doms ) each ( see figure [ icecube - detector ] )",
    ". the instrumented region will be between 1450 m and 2450 m below the surface and the hexagonal pattern will span over a @xmath14 area .",
    "the distance between doms within a string is 17 m and the distance between the strings is 125 m , with the existing amanda detector embedded inside the icecube volume .",
    "strings will be added each year until completion but the detector is taking data since the start . with it",
    "s large size , icecube should observe @xmath13 events with energies up to @xmath15 and collect many contained events .",
    "an air shower array , icetop , is deployed at the surface of the ice above icecube .",
    "it consists of 160 cherenkov tanks located close to the 80 holes .",
    "the tanks are grouped in pairs ( stations ) near a hole and are filled with water which is then allowed to freeze around two doms inside .",
    "icetop will serve several purposes : cosmic ray studies up to energies up to @xmath16 ) , search for a possible second `` knee '' for heavy particles like iron , calibration of the icecube doms using coincident atmospheric muons , vetoing of highly energetic background events originating in the atmosphere .",
    "the dom ( figure [ dom ] ) is the main component of the detector .",
    "it contains a 10-inch hamamatsu photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , enclosed in a glass vessel .",
    "an integrated circuit ( analog transient waveform digitizer , or atwd ) records the pmt pulse with three different gains ( x1/4 , x2 and x16 ) .",
    "the atwd records 128 samples with a rate of 3.3 ns / sample .",
    "the same pulse is also digitized by a 40mhz fadc . the linear dynamic range is 400 photo - electrons ( p.e ) in 15 ns and the integrated dynamic range is more than 5000 p.e . in @xmath17 .",
    "neighboring doms are connected to each other and the atwd is read out after a local triggering condition is met .",
    "each waveform is time - stamped locally .",
    "the main board contains an fpga that can be re - programmed from a computer at the surface .",
    "the doms communicate with the counting house with twisted pair copper cables and receive their power through the same cables .",
    "each dom has its own high - voltage generator .",
    "since the pulses are sent digitally , the pmt amplification can be kept low at @xmath18 .",
    "this benefits both the dynamic range and the aging of the pmts .",
    "+ the doms are deployed in holes melted with a hot - water drill .",
    "a new 5 mw drill , the enhanced hot water drill ( ehwd ) was developed for icecube and put into operation in january 2005 .",
    "this new construction is designed to drill 2500 m deep holes with a 60 cm diameter in less than 40 h , much faster than the amanda drill .",
    "the actual deployment of the doms takes less than 12 hours . with the ehwd",

    "in particular , the time calibration of quartz oscillator in each dom has been studied .",
    "these oscillators are synchronized to a master gps clock every 3.5 seconds , by sending down pulses from the surface to the doms .",
    "the calibration procedure yields a time precision of 3 ns .",
    "another measurement is the dark noise rate of the doms , which is around 700 hz . with after - pulse suppression ( implemented with an artificial dead - time of @xmath22 ) , this rate goes down to about 350 hz , see figure [ noise ] . in the same way as amanda",
    ", icecube will be able to detect the burst of low energy neutrinos that accompany a supernova explosion by measuring an excess rate above the dark noise in all its sensors .",
    "a low dark noise improves the sensitivity for such a search .",
    "string 21 has also been used to reconstruct atmospheric muons .",
    "the resulting multiplicities and zenith angles agree with simulations ( see figure [ comparison ] for the comparison ) . in january 2006 , the installation of eight more strings and 12 additional icetop stations was completed .",
    "an event passing through icetop and the nine icecube strings is shown in figure [ event ] .",
