    "thermal approach @xcite has become one of the cornerstones of our understanding of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , allowing to explain the data on hadronic abundances collected at the ags @xcite , sps @xcite , and rhic energies @xcite .    amended with the single - freeze - out scenario and a proper choice of the freeze - out geometry @xcite , it also properly describes the rhic transverse momentum spectra @xcite , collective flow @xcite , femtoscopic observables @xcite , or certain two - particle correlation variables , such as the charge balance functions @xcite .",
    "one obtains successful fits economically , with just a few thermodynamic parameters , such as the temperature , @xmath2 , the baryon and strangeness chemical potentials , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , or in the extended approach the quark fugacities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and several parameters describing the geometry and flow . for that reason in many popular approaches the thermal ( or statistical ) approach",
    "is used to model the hadronization stage of the heavy - ion reaction .",
    "much to our surprise , the first measurements at the lhc @xcite confirmed the validity of the thermal model for all identified particle species , but for the protons ! this _",
    "proton puzzle _ is indeed perplexing , as protons ( and antiprotons ) are basic products of the reaction and as such they need to be described in any successful approach . in this paper",
    "we argue that the puzzle is in some sense even deeper , as not only the abundances of all the other measured particles are correctly reproduced , but also their transverse - momentum spectra can be described without difficulty .",
    "thus , it is solely the protons ( and antiprotons ) , where the model fails to describe these basic observables .    in the present study",
    "we shall apply simple parameterizations of the freeze - out geometry , similarly as in our early work @xcite , which are motivated by the dynamical studies involving relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will explore the cracow @xcite and the blast - wave models @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that one can focus entirely on the freeze - out and flow geometry , avoiding intricacies of the earlier dynamical evolution .",
    "our basic result is that the identified transverse - momentum spectra of all up - to - now measured particles at the lhc , _ with the important exception of protons _ , can be properly fitted , describing the pb+pb data at in the soft regime .",
    "we also test the reliability of the fits with the hbt correlation data , which allows us to select the most realistic freeze - out conditions out of several different types of freeze - out studied in this work .",
    "as mentioned above , the concept of the single freeze - out @xcite allows for the uniform calculations of numerous soft hadronic observables .",
    "the simulations presented in this work have been carried out with therminator @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo method allows for a simple inclusion of the experimental cuts and , therefore , for more realistic verification of the model predictions .    at the extreme energies studied at the lhc",
    ", we expect that the midrapidity region contains equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons , hence the values of the chemical potentials used in this work are set equal to zero ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the chemical potential related to the isospin conservation ) .",
    "hence , we are left with temperature , @xmath2 , as the only independent thermodynamic parameter .",
    "a natural expectation , based on the shape of the @xmath9 freeze - out curve @xcite and confirmed by the analysis of the hadronic abundances at the lhc @xcite , is that the temperature of the chemical freeze - out at the lhc should be very similar to the value determined at rhic .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath10  mev @xcite .",
    "we note that this value is close to the value of the transition temperature of the crossover found at @xmath11 in the lattice simulations of qcd @xcite .",
    "having fixed the values of thermodynamic parameters , we test different parameterizations for the shape of the freeze - out hypersurface and for the form of flow at freezeout to achieve the best description of the transverse - momentum spectra of charged pions and kaons .",
    "we stress that in our method only these two hadron species are used to determine the geometric and expansion parameters , since they are experimentally determined with the best accuracy .",
    "we fit the cracow and blast - wave models ( by the least squares method ) to the experiment .",
    "then , the spectra of other hadrons are predictions of our approach , allowing for its verification .     plane ( and ) . the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two geometric parameters of the model .",

    ", we fit the proper time and the magnitude of the transverse flow for three different values of the slope of the freeze - out curve in minkowski space , controlled by a parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the three different choices of @xmath14 correspond to three different physical scenarios : if @xmath14 is positive the freeze - out starts at the center of the system , if @xmath14 is negative the freeze - out starts at the edges , and for @xmath15 the freeze - out happens at constant ( longitudinal proper ) time in the whole volume .    with the procedure outlined above , we find a very good agreement between the model results and the experimental data for all measured hadron species excluding protons .",
    "moreover , with the hadron spectra alone , no preference for any of the employed freeze - out models can be found .",
    "a further analysis of the pion hbt radii indicates , however , that the freeze - out hypersurface used in the generalized blast - wave model with @xmath16 leads to the best agreement between the data and theory .",
    "this confirms an earlier observation done for rhic @xcite .",
    "this type of freeze - out is also consistent with the hydrodynamic picture where the freeze - out starts at the edges of the system and continues inwards .",
    "the cracow model assumes boost - invariant and cylindrically symmetric conditions at freeze - out .",
    "the freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the condition @xcite @xmath17 and the fluid four - velocity is proportional to the space - time position @xmath18 the index @xmath19 in the symbol @xmath12 reminds us that the freeze - out takes place on the three - dimensional hypersurface of constant proper time , see fig .",
