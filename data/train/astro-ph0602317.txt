    "since its reintroduction into astrophysics by balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) has become an essential ingredient in our understanding of astrophysical fluids in a state of differential rotation . as a result of its action , strong turbulence is created anywhere there is a weak magnetic field in a conducting fluid whose rotation rate decreases away from the rotation axis .",
    "the turbulent magnetic ( and , to a lesser degree , fluid ) stress it creates is the most likely source of angular momentum transport in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "the joint action of turbulence and differential rotation can drive a dynamo capable of maintaining the magnetic energy at a few percent of the fluid internal energy .",
    "applications of these mechanisms have been found in a wide range of circumstances , from supernovae ( akiyama et al .",
    "2003 ) to galaxies ( kim et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , it is a condition for growth that the field be weak . to be precise ,",
    "when gas and magnetic pressure combine to support the disk material against the vertical component of gravity , the matter s scale - height is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the alfven speed , @xmath8 the sound speed , and @xmath9 the local orbital frequency .",
    "because magnetic tension suppresses growth for wavelengths @xmath10 , only if the magnetic energy density is less than the gas pressure ( i.e. , the plasma @xmath11 ) can modes with short enough wavelength to fit in the disk ( @xmath12 ) be unstable . at the same time , although the magnitude of the fastest growing wavelength depends ( linearly ) on the field strength , its growth rate @xmath13 is entirely independent of the field s intensity .",
    "on the other hand , if there were truly zero field , magnetic dynamics would , of course , be irrelevant .",
    "thus , it appears that the nature of the mri in the limit of progressively weaker field is ill - defined , at least within the framework of ideal mhd .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to begin clarifying what happens in this extreme weak - field limit , developing linear theory to account both for growth and damping .",
    "we do so in part to illuminate this point of principle , but we also identify several astrophysical contexts in which the field may be so weak that the special effects we discover in the weak - field limit may be of interest .",
    "these include galaxies so young that their interstellar magnetic fields have not yet grown to interesting amplitude , accretion systems in primordial galaxies where the seed fields may have been very weak , and proto - stellar accretion flows in which the charge resides primarily on massive grains .",
    "some aspects of our work are related to results already in the literature . in particular , there has already been significant study of how the mri operates in media where the magnetic field is weak in a different sense : where the field is considered weak not because it fails to dominate gravity , but because it is not strong enough for the lorentz force it produces to dominate the momentum transfer associated with collisions between charged species and neutrals .",
    "this case is called the hall regime , and has been analyzed by balbus & terquem ( 2001 ) and salmeron & wardle ( 2003 ) .",
    "we uncover hall effects too , but of a different sort ( see   [ s : threeregimes ] ) .",
    "similarly , we will be interested in a breakdown of ideal mhd in the sense that the electrons and ions are not tied perfectly to the magnetic field .",
    "a different failure of the mhd approximation in the context of the mri has been examined by quataert , dorland , & hammett ( 2002 ) , sharma , hammett , & quataert ( 2003 ) , and balbus ( 2004 ) , who have explored the implications of collisionless behavior .",
    "they find that anisotropic pressure , anisotropic viscosous transport , and landau damping , none of which is captured by mhd , can be important . in ",
    "[ s : damping ] , we argue that all three of these effects are unimportant in the weak - field regime . finally , kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2004 ) have considered the mri in protogalactic disks and estimated the fieldstrength below which the instability is resistively damped .",
    "to explore this new regime , we adopt the simplest non - trivial model that can describe the physics of the weak - field regime : a two - fluid picture of a cold but fully - ionized disk , threaded by a uniform magnetic field @xmath14 , orbiting in a gravitational potential determined by external sources .",
    "the conventional single - fluid mhd limit implicitly assumes that the plasma and the fieldlines are frozen together ; in order to see how they decouple in the limit of weak field , we must follow the dynamics of the positive and negative charge - carriers separately . that is to say ,",
    "we define the system in terms of separate force equations for two incompressible fluids , with no pressure gradients .",
    "the fields are determined by using the currents derived from the velocities of the two charged fluids in the ampre equation and using the changing magnetic fields created by those currents in faraday s law .",
    "we use cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath15 and denote radial derivatives by primes . in the equilibrium state , particles follow circular orbits of radius @xmath16 with angular velocity @xmath17 given by the usual expression @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the particles are prevented from gyrating around the magnetic fieldlines by a radial electric field @xmath19 .",
    "we consider small axisymmetric perturbations of this system , denoting the electric and magnetic field perturbations by @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the perturbations of particle radius and angular velocity by @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the cold plasma approximation ,",
    "all the particles of a given species have the same perturbed orbits , but the orbits differ between species .",
    "we assume all perturbed quantities depend on time and vertical coordinate @xmath24 as @xmath25 and perform a local analysis in which radial derivatives of the perturbed quantities are dropped .",
    "the linearized equations of motion for particles of charge @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 are @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cyclotron frequency ( note that the sign of @xmath31 depends on the signs of both @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) . in deriving these equations",
    "we have assumed @xmath33 , which is consistent with the local analysis , and we have used @xmath34 .",
    "we solve equations ( [ e : rmotion ] ) and ( [ e : tmotion ] ) for the perturbed velocity components @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of @xmath20 .",
    "the results are @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the squared epicyclic frequency .",
    "although our analysis up to this point has been valid for any gravitational potential , from this point on , we assume a keplerian rotation law , for which @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the perturbed current density @xmath42 is related to the perturbed velocity components by @xmath43 the summation is over species , and @xmath44 is number density .",
    "we assume two species , of charge @xmath45 and equal density .",

    "the quantity @xmath51 in the definition of @xmath50 is the squared ion plasma frequency , @xmath52 , so @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 measures the wavelength in terms of the ion inertial length @xmath54 : @xmath55 . one interpretation of @xmath56 is that it is the larmor radius of an ion traveling at the alfvn speed : that is , @xmath57 . in an electron - proton plasma , @xmath58 cm . in most astrophysical situations",

    "( [ e : dr ] ) .",
    "it is an 8th degree polynomial equation for @xmath71 . in most of the parameter space that interests us ,",
    "we find that the solutions are positive and negative pairs of either purely real or purely imaginary numbers .",
    "when this is so , solutions of eqn .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) with @xmath72 correspond to instability , and perturbations are either purely oscillatory or purely exponential in time .",
    "it is likewise clear from the form of eqn .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) that the magnetic field strength enters only in terms of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath0 appears sometimes by itself ( representing ions ) and sometimes in a product with @xmath66 ( representing electrons ) .",
    "thus , whether the field is strong or weak depends on whether the cyclotron frequency ( usually of the positive charge carrier ) is large or small compared to the orbital frequency .",
    "we first consider the conventional limit of eqn .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) : the case of ordinary mhd , in which @xmath76 and the ratio @xmath66 is that of an electron - proton plasma , 1837 . in this limit , the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 take the asymptotic forms @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "equation  ( [ e : dr ] ) becomes @xmath81 equation ( [ e : mhd ] ) is the standard mri dispersion relation for a keplerian disk , albeit written in an unfamiliar form .",
    "there is a positive real root when @xmath82 .",
    "as has been well - known since their original paper ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) , the maximum growth rate occurs for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 = 0.75 .",
    "thus , the maximum growth rate occurs for wavelengths @xmath85 times longer than the minimum wavelength for growth , and @xmath86 for wavelengths much larger than the minimum .    in the mhd regime",
    ", both the ions and electrons closely follow the fieldlines , which have the @xmath87 velocity @xmath88 . as @xmath4 decreases and @xmath89 approaches @xmath9 ,",
    "the ions deviate from the fieldlines , while the electrons , due to their much smaller mass , continue to follow them .",
    "this regime of behavior ( i.e. , @xmath90 or less ) is often called the  hall regime \" of the mri because charge - sign differences lead to noticeable dynamical contrasts .",
    "as we shall see , that is definitely the case here , but with the slight interpretive shift that what really matters is not so much charge - sign _ per se _ as the sense of the larmor orbit for the heavier particle relative to the sense of the gravitational orbits for all particles .",
    "much of the essential behavior of this regime is captured by approximating @xmath77 and @xmath78 by @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation , which is valid as long as @xmath93 but @xmath4 is not @xmath73 , is @xmath94 equation ( [ e : postmhd ] ) predicts instability for @xmath95 .",
    "this can occur in either of two ways : in the special range of @xmath0 given by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the system is unstable at all wavelengths .",
    "that is , when the larmor frequency and the orbital frequency are comparable in magnitude but have opposite sign for the heavier charged particle , unstable growth occurs at _ all _ wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , whenever @xmath0 is in the range for which the approximations leading to eqn .",
    "( [ e : postmhd ] ) are valid , growth occurs , but only at sufficiently long wavelengths . because @xmath90 , the quadratic character of the expression for the minimum unstable wavelength leads to significant differences between positive and negative @xmath0 : it is longer for positive @xmath0 and shorter for @xmath98 . similarly , the maximum growthrate is @xmath99 for negative @xmath0 , whereas it can be substantially smaller for positive @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath4 is still smaller , @xmath75 , a different analytic approximation applies : @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in that limit , the dispersion relation becomes @xmath102 where @xmath103 is proportional to the square of the wavelength in units of the electron inertial length @xmath104 : @xmath105 is the natural analog of @xmath106 in a regime where the ions play no role in the dynamics and the mode is carried by electrons .",
    "( [ e : vsmallx ] ) has one solution corresponding to a mode that grows unstably when @xmath107 : @xmath108 . even in this regime ,",
    "the growth rates can be comparable to the rotation rate : the peak growth rate , @xmath109 , occurs for @xmath110 .",
    "however , because @xmath111  cm is so small in most systems of interest , we are primarily interested in the case @xmath112 . in this limit , @xmath113 .",
    "that is , the modes of greatest interest grow very slowly .      exact solutions of the full dispersion relation are shown in figures  [ fig : posdisperse ] , [ fig : negdisperse ] , and [ fig : smalldisperse ] in order to show the transitions between these regimes and confirm our analytic approximations .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : posdisperse ] , when the field and the rotation rate are aligned , as @xmath0 falls toward @xmath99 and below , the weakening ability of the field to control the ion motion leads both to a narrowing in the range of unstable wavelengths and to a reduction in the maximum growthrate .",
    "when @xmath90 but @xmath114 , as predicted by our analytic approximation , there is rapid growth at short wavelengths even while the same wavelength range is damped for positive @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : negdisperse ] ) .",
    "the reason for this contrast is that when @xmath2 , the larmor motion opposes the orbital rotation where the orbital frequency is greater and adds to the orbital rotation where it is smaller , whereas it is the other way around for @xmath3 .",
    "balbus & terquem ( 2001 ) and wardle ( 1999 ) similarly found that disks with field and orbital frequency anti - parallel are more unstable than those in which they are parallel . at somewhat smaller values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the behavior becomes more similar for the two opposite signs .",
    "our analytic approximation for @xmath115 is also confirmed by the full numerical solution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smalldisperse ] ) , which finds a minimum wavelength for growth @xmath116 , a maximum growthrate at wavelengths a few times longer , and a growthrate that declines @xmath117 for still longer wavelengths . in this regime ,",
    "the field - strength parameter @xmath0 does nt appear explicitly in the dispersion relation , eliminating any dependence on the magnetic field strength .",
    "in other words , when @xmath4 is this small , the instability dynamics are no longer magneto - rotational .",
    "they are better described as the result of current fluctuations that inductively drive electric field fluctuations with the appropriate phase relative to the gravitational force as to cause instability . because @xmath118 |\\vec j_1|$ ] , fluctuations on wavelengths that are too short are ineffective , and there is a minimum wavelength for instability .",
    "this minimum wavelength must be of order the characteristic lengthscale , which in this case is the electron inertial length ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the coupling to gravity makes the characteristic timescale @xmath120 , but only on the short scales @xmath121 .",
    "the instability for @xmath115 can be recovered directly from eqns .",
    "( [ e : rmotion ] ) and ( [ e : tmotion ] ) by dropping the terms in which @xmath31 appears , computing @xmath42 from the electron motion alone , and using eqn .",
    "( [ e : je ] ) .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is exactly eqn .",
    "( [ e : vsmallx ] ) . in this limit ,",
    "the perturbed electron motion is diagonally across the unperturbed orbit , oriented such that inward radial motion is in the forward azimuthal direction .",
    "this electron motion creates a perturbed oscillating electric field of the same orientation and a perturbed oscillating magnetic field with complementary angle to the orbit and phase offset by @xmath122 .",
    "because the magnetic field is larger in amplitude than the electric field by a ratio @xmath123 , the mean electromagnetic stress is dominated by the magnetic part ; it is @xmath124 , so that it transports angular momentum outward .",
    "it can similarly be shown from eqns .",
    "( [ e : r1 ] ) and ( [ e : t1 ] ) , together with the dispersion relation for unstable modes , that the torque on an electron , @xmath125 , is in phase with the radial displacement @xmath22 .",
    "that is , an outwardly ( inwardly ) displaced electron has a positive ( negative ) angular momentum perturbation , which reinforces the motion .",
    "thus , this mode might fairly be called an  electromagnetic - rotational instability \" .    summarizing these results ,",
    "we have found that the most rapidly growing wavelength has @xmath126 or @xmath127 for all field strengths @xmath128 .",
    "the maximum growth rate @xmath129 when @xmath130 , but is smaller when @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the magnetic character of instability finally disappears when @xmath115 , leaving an electromagnetic - gravitational mode that is unstable for @xmath133 and grows at a rate @xmath134 on scales of order the electron inertial length @xmath135 , and at much slower rates on global scales .    for all cases in which @xmath4 is not @xmath73 , the physical scale of these modes becomes very short compared to any likely structural scale .",
    "for example , if the plasma is located in a geometrically - thin disk that is supported by its own gas pressure against the vertical component of gravity , the wavelength of the most rapidly - growing mode is a fraction @xmath136 of the vertical scale - height ; when the field is very weak , this is likely to be an extremely small fraction .",
    "it is not clear whether such small scale disturbances can play a significant role in either angular momentum transport or dynamo - generation .",
    "they may be damped by other processes ( see   [ s : damping ] ) ; even if they are not damped , inverse cascades in the nonlinear regime may be necessary for them to have significant global effect .",
    "therefore , we devote special effort to understanding the nature of instability at long wavelengths , even if the modes are slowly growing . by limiting consideration to large @xmath50 , we can simplify eqn .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) to the point that we may derive approximately by analytic means some of the numerical results just illustrated .    to lowest - order in @xmath137 , eqn .",
    "( [ e : dr ] ) reduces to @xmath138 the solution in this limit is @xmath139 , or stable epicyclic oscillations .",
    "to next lowest - order , we find a low growthrate unstable mode with @xmath140 this solution corresponds to the low growthrate , long wavelength tail seen in figures  [ fig : posdisperse ] and [ fig : negdisperse ] .",
    "for @xmath141 , it gives an approximation to the correct scaling , but overestimates the maximum growth rate by @xmath142 .",
    "for a hydrogen plasma , the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ e : lownu ] ) is positive , signifying instability for all @xmath0 . in the mhd limit , @xmath143 , and",
    "this approximation holds quite well even for @xmath144 . if @xmath145 , @xmath71 approaches the limiting value @xmath146 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , although cold plasma theory predicts that there is no minimum magnetic field necessary for instability , the growth rate at macroscopically interesting wavelengths is very slow .      in certain circumstances ( e.g. , electron - positron pair plasmas , dust grains as the predominant charge carriers ) ,",
    "the charge / mass ratio for both the positive and negative charges in the plasma may be the same , and therefore both have the same magnitude cyclotron frequency . in that case , the parameter @xmath67 , and the dispersion relation changes form .",
    "we find that there are modest , but interesting , changes in the character of the magneto - rotational instability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdisperse ] ) .",
    "so long as @xmath0 is greater than a few , the maximum growthrate is @xmath147 and the wavelength of most rapid growth has @xmath148 .",
    "when @xmath149 , growth becomes possible at all wavelengths , not just for those longer than a critical length . at",
    "still smaller @xmath0 , although the maximum growthrate remains @xmath99 , there is once again a minimum wavelength for growth . just as in the ordinary plasma case",
    ", this minimum wavelength is fixed at the inertial length ; here , however , this length is the same for the species carrying both signs of charge .",
    "this behavior sets in at @xmath150 because the ratio @xmath151 .",
    "before considering possible damping mechanisms , we evaluate the efficiency of the mri in the weak - field regime for driving angular momentum transport in disks .",
    "we begin by computing the vertically averaged energy density @xmath152 and shear stress @xmath153 associated with an mri mode : @xmath154 @xmath155 where the angle brackets denote vertical averages and @xmath156 is the mass density . the ratio @xmath157 measures the efficiency of angular momentum transport at fixed mode energy density .",
    "the sign is chosen so as to make @xmath158 positive for mri modes .",
    "the ion velocities can be expressed in terms of the magnetic field fluctuations using faraday s law and eqns .",

    "the persistence of rapidly growing global modes even when @xmath197 is due to the anisotropic pressure associated with magnetic field perturbations in the collisionless regime . however , these effects disappear if the magnetic field is so weak that the ions are unmagnetized , because the ion pressure anisotropy is then reduced .",
    "we therefore expect that a single - pressure description should be satisfactory when @xmath4 is small .",
    "depending on whether @xmath198 is @xmath199 ( the collisional regime ) or @xmath73 ( collisionless ) , different mechanisms are responsible for damping . in the collisionless case , damping occurs when energy is exchanged through a resonance between the wave and those particles with velocity such that the wave is stationary in the particle rest frame . the wave is damped if the slope of the particle distribution function projected along @xmath200 , @xmath201 , is negative .",

    "we have shown that an ideal plasma with a magnetic field oriented along the rotation axis is always unstable , and there is almost always a mode that grows at a rate comparable to the rotation frequency @xmath9 ( the exception is the range @xmath131 , in which the maximum growth rate is somewhat slower when the field and the angular velocity are in the same direction ) . when @xmath279 , the fastest growing mode has a wavelength on the scale of the electron skin depth @xmath280 km .",

    "this asymmetry is a manifestation of the different charge / mass ratios for charge carriers of opposite sign : the lower - mass charge - carrier remains well - magnetized even while the opposite sign charge - carrier , of opposite charge sign , deviates from the fieldlines .",
    "except for the range @xmath266 , in which growth rates of order @xmath9 persist at arbitrarily long wavelengths , the fastest growing mode is near the wavenumber @xmath281 , and the growth rate scales linearly with @xmath186 for @xmath282 .",
    "this behavior is similar to what is predicted by ideal mhd , even though @xmath283 need not be much greater than the dynamical frequency .",
    "the fastest growing modes are also the most efficient at transporting angular momentum .",
    "thermal effects modify this picture . if @xmath270 has an azimuthal component and the ions are magnetized ( @xmath64 ) but have a long mean free path , there are modes with @xmath284 with growth rates near @xmath9 ( quataert , dorland , & hammett 2002 , balbus 2004 ) .",
    "these effects do not appear if @xmath270 is vertical , but thermal effects are still substantial in that they cause damping .",
    "although collisionless damping appears to be weak , especially for the short wavelength modes , collisional damping  both viscous and resistive  can be strong .",
    "it increases with wavenumber as @xmath225 until it saturates at the ion mean free path @xmath215 ( viscous damping ) or @xmath285 ( resistive damping ) .",

    "however , if one of the gradient scales is @xmath302 , the mri would overtake the battery somewhat sooner , when @xmath303 ( particularly if @xmath3 ) .",
    "on the other hand , collisional damping can in many circumstances substantially reduce the growth rate ( e.g. , as in the case described by eqn .",
    "[ e : longgrowth ] ) .",
    "when that is the case , the biermann battery dominates as long as @xmath304 ) can be much greater than one , because of the smallness of @xmath56 compared to global scales . here",
    "longer collision time leads to a wider range of battery dominance because it also means that the minimum wavelength for growth is greater , and that suppresses the mri growth rate .",
    "the biermann battery can also operate in shock fronts and ionization fronts propagating in structured media .",
    "these contexts can be of interest in cosmological and galactic settings ( kulsrud et al .",
    "1997 , gnedin , ferrara , & zweibel 2000 ) .",
    "one of the lengthscales @xmath289 or @xmath290 is replaced by the thickness of the front , @xmath305 , but the battery operates within each fluid element for only as long as it takes the front to cross it , @xmath306 .",

    "other plasma properties being equal , the fields produced in disks exceed the fields produced in fronts after a time of order @xmath313 .",
    "we now apply these generic results about the complementary relationship between biermann batteries and the mri in some specific settings . at least in these examples , we find that the mri has little impact because collisional damping is so strong when the field is extremely weak .      one particular setting in which these effects may act is the initial growth of density perturbations at high redshift .",
    "it is possible that the only magnetic field at that point is the field arising from the biermann battery .",

    "thus , under these conditions , any possible mri effects would in fact be in the weak - field regime .",
    "only after the gas temperature has risen considerably ( e.g. , due to shocks in collapsing clouds ) and the relevant gradient scales have become more characteristic of galaxies than of intergalactic gas would the mri operate in the ordinary regime .    at the earliest stages of magnetic field amplification , where @xmath115 , there could be growth over all possible wavelengths in the electron - dominated modes",

    "however , as soon as the modes shift over to the conventional mri , damping restricts the range of growing wavelengths to only those on roughly cosmological scales : @xmath319 moreover , the fastest growing electron modes are probably damped by resistivity .",
    "thus , this appears to be an unpromising venue for significant mri effects .",
    "the magnetic fields generated by the biermann battery operating in cosmological shocks and ionization fronts are of order @xmath320 g , corresponding to @xmath321 s@xmath277 , or less .",

    "if the seed field in accreting matter then were much weaker than it would be today , the question arises as to whether the mri would successfully amplify the field to the level at which accretion becomes efficient .",
    "indeed , there may be a  bootstrap \" issue here : it has been suggested that magnetized outflows from early disks could have injected the first significant magnetic field into large portions of the intergalactic medium ( daly & loeb 1990 , kronberg et al .",

    "it is very large : @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the accretion rate in eddington units and @xmath338 is the optical depth through the disk .",
    "this estimate , by the way , is independent of whether the vertical support of the disk is dominated by gas or by radiation pressure ; it assumes only that angular momentum and energy are conserved , dissipated energy is radiated locally , the disk is in a steady - state , and that the disk is optically thick so that the temperature in its interior is @xmath339 times larger than at its surface .",
    "thus , significant accretion rates ( as measured in eddington units ) go hand - in - hand with large @xmath4 unless the stress per unit surface density is so low that the disk accumulates a very large mass .",
    "suppose , then , that a disk is formed , but without any magnetic field , and therefore without any turbulence or inflow .",
    "can it ever work its way to a state of efficient accretion ? in order to avoid a singular state",

    "under almost any circumstances , we expect the disk to be stratified both radially and vertically , and , because of local heating and cooling processes , to be nonbarytropic .",
    "this , too , is a context in which the biermann battery should operate .    here",
    "the crossed gradients must be in the radial and vertical directions , so @xmath340 . ) , vertical and radial gradients generate an azimuthal field .",

    "the reason is the extremely large ratio @xmath353 .",

    ". a random magnetic field is generated , and the gradient lengthscales in eqn .",
    "( [ e : biermann ] ) are the characteristic turbulent scales .",
    "the operation of the mri in such a field is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our last example is neither cosmological nor involves the biermann battery . in this case , we consider how the mri operates when most of the charge in the medium is carried by dust . in many circumstances of high gas density and low temperature such as dense molecular clouds or proto - stellar accretion disks ,",
    "it is possible that most of the charge in the plasma may actually reside on grains rather than ions or electrons ( draine & sutin 1987 , nishi et al .",
    "because the ability of grains to hold charge depends strongly on their size distribution , there are substantial uncertainties regarding the specific parameters of the regimes where this condition may obtain . nonetheless , it is of interest to examine the consequences for the mri wherever this state may exist .",
    "the most direct impact is that the charged species traversing larmor orbits have masses greater than a proton by a factor @xmath354 or more .",

    "however , our simple two - fluid theory can not be directly applied to this situation because it assumes the charge carriers account for the bulk of the inertia , an assumption that fails badly when grains are the charge carriers .",
    "an appropriate theory would need to incorporate a third fluid : the neutral background , including its inertia and the rate of momentum exchange between the neutrals and both kinds of charge carriers .",
    "these latter effects were the primary focus of the papers by balbus & terquem ( 2001 ) and salmeron & wardle ( 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , in the limit they considered , the cross - field current was determined by balancing the @xmath362 force with the ion - neutral drag force . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimates of the previous paragraph demonstrate that there may be contexts in which linear theories of the mri that take proper account of resistivity , hall effects , and so on , and yet ignore the dynamical effects of a small ratio of cyclotron frequency to orbital frequency may be equally incomplete .    pending a complete investigation of this problem ,",
    "we offer a few rough estimates .",
    "first , we have already noted that our parameter @xmath363 , where @xmath61 is the hall parameter defined by balbus & terquem ( 2001 ) and @xmath62 is the ratio of the mass per electron to the ion mass . when the plasma is strongly - ionized , hall effects go hand - in - hand with weak - field effects ; in a state of weak ionization , hall effects can be important even when @xmath364 .",
    "however , if grains are the charge - carriers , the subscripts  e \" and  i \" refer to the negative and positive charge - carrying grains , so that @xmath365 and the regime of hall effects can , as in the strongly - ionized case , be identified with the regime of weak - field effects .",
    "next , let the effective collision frequency between charged grains and the background neutral medium be @xmath366 ( i.e. , this is the neutral - grain collision rate divided by the grain / neutral mass ratio ) .",
    "following balbus & terquem ( 2001 ) , we estimate the relative importance of inductive and ohmic effects by the magnetic reynolds number , which may be written in our notation as @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the ratio of ( charged ) grain mass to neutral mass and must be @xmath369 . in this expression",
    "we have taken the relevant length scale to be @xmath370 . given that @xmath371 in most cases of this sort , small @xmath0 effects will also typically be associated with small magnetic reynolds number , and therefore are likely to occur in the context of strongly damped modes , except for @xmath372 .",
    "we have shown that generalizing from cold single - fluid theory to cold two - fluid theory permits at least an approximate description of how the magneto - rotational instability behaves as the field becomes extremely weak . ",
    "weak \" in this sense may be parameterized in terms of the ratio between the ion cyclotron frequency and the rotational frequency , the quantity we have labelled @xmath0 .",
    "little in the basic nature of the instability changes so long as @xmath373 , although the characteristic wavelength scale is proportional to @xmath0 , and can therefore become very short compared to other interesting scales .",
    "complications arise when @xmath374 . ",
    "hall effects \" , dynamical distinctions between the behavior of the two signs of charge , become important .",
    "when the field and the rotation are aligned , so @xmath0 is positive , the maximum growth rate for @xmath0 in that range can be significantly diminished . on the other hand ,",
    "when the field and the rotation are anti - parallel , giving negative @xmath0 , the maximum growth rate , while reduced somewhat , remains closer to @xmath9 . in addition",
    ", unstable growth becomes possible at arbitrarily short wavelengths , even though it is not possible in stronger fields .",
    "the entire character of the modes changes when @xmath4 falls below @xmath375 , the mass ratio between the negative and positive charge carriers , and is better described as  electromagnetic - rotational \" than  magnetic - rotational \" . in this regime ,",

    "these are exactly the scales on which thermal effects , not included in the simple fluid picture , might intervene .",
    "a complete account of these effects is beyond the scope of this paper , but simple estimates suggest that , as expected , they are often able to damp all but the longest - wavelength modes .",
    "because the growth rate typically scales @xmath253 for wavelengths longer than the characteristic wavelength , growth can be very slow for even the fastest modes that escape collisional damping .",
    "thus , the ability of the mri to amplify magnetic field may be severely weakened even for values of @xmath4 substantially greater than @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , to answer one of the questions with which we began , the magnetic field becomes too weak to be effective when the preferred scale of instability ( @xmath377 ) is so small that transport - associated dissipation ( resistivity and viscosity ) limits growth .",
    "lastly , we have applied these ideas to a few astrophysical contexts in which extremely weak fields might be expected . on the basis of these estimates ,",
    "we find that it may , for example , be very difficult for accretion disks formed from primordial gas in which no magnetic field has been embedded to  bootstrap \" themselves from a state of initially weak field to a state in which the field is strong enough to drive rapid accretion . likewise ,",
    "the mri is unlikely to be an efficient mechanism for amplifying battery - generated magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium , or in protogalactic disks ; dynamos in these systems must be driven by other forms of turbulence .",
    "the most favorable bootstrap disk environments appear to be hot , low density disks with short rotation periods . in such systems",
    "collisional damping is relatively weak , and the instability may be driven by anisotropic pressure and viscosity at global scales . on the other hand , because the important parameter is the ratio of cyclotron frequency for the more massive charge carriers to the rotation frequency , proto - stellar accretion disks in which dust grains carry most of the charge may exhibit some of the effects we have pointed out .",
