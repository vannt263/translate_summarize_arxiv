    "due to the inapplicability and high computational complexity of cryptography in many dynamic wireless environments , physical layer security techniques @xcite for securing the transfer of highly sensitive information in wireless communications have attracted significant attention in the past decades .",
    "systems such as mobile personal healthcare records @xcite , contactless payment cards @xcite , telemedicine systems using wireless networks @xcite and military sensor networks @xcite all employ wireless technologies to transmit potentially sensitive information . in particular , placing jammers as cooperative communication nodes has recently been explored as an effective means to achieve the secure wireless communications from eavesdroppers @xcite . by exploiting the shared nature of wireless channels , the successful deployments of jammers for",
    "security must achieve the twin goals that i ) reducing the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of eavesdroppers to a level that far below a threshold for successful reception , and ii ) maintaining the sufficient channel qualities such that the sinr at the legitimate receivers are not reduced too much so as to prevent the reception of _ wireless information transfer _",
    "however , this is often realized at the expense of additional power consumption for friendly jammers .",
    "conventional energy harvesting methods rely on various renewable energy sources in the environments , such as solar , wind , vibration and thermoelectric , that are usually unstable and uncontrollable .",
    "in contrast , the recent advance in radio frequency ( rf ) enabled _ wireless power transfer _ ( wpt )",
    "technology provides an attractive solution by powering wireless nodes with continuous and stable energy over the air @xcite .",
    "the key idea of this technology is by leveraging the far - field radiative properties of electromagnetic wave ( emw ) , the wireless nodes could capture emw remotely from rf signals and convert it into direct current to charge its battery .",
    "recently , the wpt has attracted great interests in the research community on energy constrained wireless networks . in @xcite , the authors studied the sources simultaneously performing the wpt and wit to destinations and problem that how the wireless nodes makes use of the harvested energy from wpt to enable communications .",
    "motivated by these works , the process of wet can be fully controlled , hence it is preferred to be applied in wireless networks with critical quality - of - service requirements , such as secure wireless communications . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered secure communications with the existence of a single information receiver and several wireless energy - harvesting eavesdroppers . in @xcite",
    ", the authors presented the coexistence of three types of destination in a simple wireless communication scenario : an information receiver , an eavesdropper and a harvesting wireless energy receiver .",
    "as noticed , all these works @xcite on only focus on the process of energy - harvesting , the use of which at the receivers ( e.g. , friendly jammers ) for secure communications is not studied .",
    "recently , work @xcite used the harvested power at a friendly jammer as a useful resource to emit constructive interference to attack the eavesdroppers that secures the legitimate wireless communication link for the first time .",
    "however , their focus is only on a single communication link , where the placement of multiple friendly jammers in a geographical locations and and the energy efficiency ( ee ) issue in the power management for general wireless networks applications are not studied yet .",
    "similar to @xcite , we consider the following typical scenario that the legitimate communication is often conducted in some restricted geographic locations , where jammers placed in the vicinity are used to secure the legitimate communication .",
    "different from offline ( centralized ) solution @xcite that the transmission power and number of jammers are required to be optimized separately over a known geographic region , we do not restrict the scale and geometry of the geographic locations and emphasize the potential dynamics of nodes within the secure communication .",
    "hence , distributed and online jammers placement protocols are desirable . in this case",
    ", the friendly jammers have the flexibility to be placed randomly at any feasible locations .",
    "therefore , their lifetime is usually constrained to the energy stored in the battery , and weh as a promising approach @xcite is demanding to prolong their lifetime .",
    "thus , it is highly motivating to study the ee by leveraging both the weh and the interfering power allocation processes in the power management .      as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , the legitimate communications within a region , named as _ storage _ @xmath0 , surrounded by a _ fence _ @xmath1 , and the jammers are placed between the space of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to protect the legitimate communications from eavesdroppers lying outside the fence . to this end , the friendly jammers act as passive security assistants of legitimate communication links .",
    "the deployments of this low cost and simple passive jammers brings both the important advantages and challenges : on the one hand , the weh - based scheme without any power line connection facilitate the flexibly online jammer deployments .",
    "such placements are inherently local and particularly useful in distributed deployments , which is highly desirable for complex geographic areas , e.g. , lofty and rugged hills , rough grounds , pot - holed city streets and architectures , etc . and",
    "large - scale network deployments ; on the other hand , jammers should have low design cost and complexity as well as have high efficiency in energy harvesting method to enable its functionality . moreover , the jammers are not capable to communicate with each other and can only passively report their  remaining energy status \" ( as  energy demands \" from the perspective of legitimate networks ) periodically to the transmitters . in these settings ,",
    "when a request of placing a new jammer targeting on a passive eavesdropper ( or potential eavesdropping position ) arrives , an online algorithm needs to decide whether to accept the request and assign a transmission power ( one out of @xmath2 channels in the multi - channel setting ) to it .",
    "decisions about the acceptance as well as the power and channel assignments can not be revoked later .    to solve the above secure communications problem",
    ", we propose to use a set of wireless - powered friendly jammers as a defensive and constructive interference - emitting companions , where jammers harvest energy via wpt from the legitimate source nodes .",
    "the energy harvesting circuit of the jammers ( e.g. , consisting of a passive low - pass filter and diode(s ) @xcite ) is very simple and cost effective , and such a configuration is very easy to be controlled by the external energy sources .",
    "we use a simple  time switching \" scheme @xcite such that there are two phases within a complete secure communication circle : namely wpt and wit for secure communication . in the first phase , due to locations",
    "varies over time and csi is not available from the passive jammers to the energy sources and different energy demand of each jammer , it is challenging to find the optimal energy scheduling algorithm for wpt .     and",
    "the storage @xmath1 . ]    in the second phase , using competitive analysis , we study algorithms using distance - based power assignments from each placed jammer to the eavesdropper location(s ) . accepted placement request must satisfies constraints on the sinr for both eavesdroppers and legitimate receivers .",
    "the aim is to minimize the number of accepted placement requests of jammers .",
    "we first focus on the case of a single channel for the request sets with spatial lengths in @xmath3 $ ] and average minimal duration between legitimate wit and eavesdropping in @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the main contributions of this work are summarized below :    _ 1)_. the novelty of the work lies in the design of the first distributed protocol that provides secure communication in any geographically restricted communication networks using energy - constrained friendly jammers wirelessly powered by legitimate transmitters as energy sources .    _",
    "2)_. we consider the energy - efficiency ( ee ) during the whole design .",
    "we adopt a time - division based protocol with during the wpt phase , where legitimate transmitters only provide quota total energy @xmath5 within a total weh micro - slots of @xmath6 .",
    "the problem is named as the _ jam - net lifetime maximization_. it is formulated by an adaptive constrained integer linear program ( ilp ) to meet the goal of ee with heterogenous energy demands .",
    "we analysis the originally hard problem from several aspects with practical implementation considerations by advanced online learning algorithms , which indicates that the optimal online scheduling algorithms are available .",
    "in addition , for constructive jamming power assignment , we studied the linear power assignment based on the previous _ distance - based _ power assignment policy , which has the advantage of being energy - minimal .",
    "_ 3)_. the friendly jammers only need to know minimal information about the communication taking place .",
    "they are proactive rather than reactive , requiring no overhead for the legitimate communication nodes and no synchronization amongst themselves .",
    "our protocol supports dynamic behaviors , e.g. , mobility , eavesdropping ( communicating ) completion or addition / removal of nodes , as along the secure communication are restricted to the storage .",
    "however , our proposed protocol is adaptive to the situations such information is available , e.g. , exact positions and frequency of both legitimate communications and eavesdropping behaviors , and foreseen further ee improvements and reduced number of jammers .    _",
    "4)_. we indicate that it is np - hard to minimize the number of placed jammers necessary to protect the geographic domain of secure communications .",
    "* we derive , for any fixed @xmath7 , the upper bound of @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the competitive ratio of any deterministic online algorithm without and with the knowledge of duration @xmath10 . *",
    "then , we extend the result to the general polynomial power assignment with parameter @xmath11 that can not yield a competitive ratio worsen than @xmath12 ; for the square root power assignment , it yields an upper bound of @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , we show that this bound holds for any distance - based power assignment . *",
    "our upper bounds reveals an exponential gap of the achievable approximation guarantees between deterministic online and offline @xcite algorithms .",
    "the main difficulty of the online scenario turns out to be that the request can not be ordered by length due to distributed deployments .",
    "given @xmath13 $ ] , we showed that the square root @xmath14 achieves near optimal competitive radio among all distance - based power assignments and it superior to any other polynomial power assignment .",
    "* we extended our analysis to the multi - channel cases .",
    "we generalize the analysis of algorithm from 1 to @xmath2 channels . using @xmath15 channels",
    "is only @xmath16-competitive .",
    "it indicates an exponential reduction in the competitive ratio , which indicates that the _ multi - channel diversity _ could improve the security of legitimate communications .",
    "most related work , e.g. @xcite-@xcite , focused on the wiretap channel @xcite in the field of information theory , in which a single eavesdropper tries to listen to legitimate communication between a pair of nodes .",
    "it is shown that perfect security is possible when the eavesdropper s channel quality is lower than a threshold .",
    "recent works @xcite also focus on the mimo wiretap channel where the transmitter , receiver and eavesdropper may configured with multiple antennas . in @xcite , the authors had used a wireless - powered relay to help the point - to - point communication . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied the friendly jamming signal design to help the secure communication based on the knowledge of the uncontrollable energy harvesting process .",
    "different from @xcite @xcite , authors in @xcite considered the weh at a friendly jammer to emitting constructive jamming power for a secure communication link , where the jamming power and rate parameters are optimized for secure communication . however , most of these works primarily targeted to the theoretical significant due to the simple scenario under consideration but do not explore the geometry of the problem sufficiently .",
    "vilela et al .",
    "@xcite showed that without any assumptions on the locations of friendly jammers and eavesdroppers , jammers could co - transmitting with the legitimate transmitter and in the vicinity of a common destination .",
    "the authors formulated this setting as a graph and use ilp to find an optimal subset of jamming nodes . in @xcite , the authors study the asymptotic behaviors for jammers and eavesdroppers at the stochastically distributed locations . in particular , they proposed the concept of _ secure throughput _ , which is based on the probability that a message is successfully received only by legitimate receivers . to our best knowledge ,",
    "@xcite are the only works that adapt friendly jammers into complex geometric positioning constraints .",
    "they provided offline optimal solutions to jammer placement problem that involves both continuous aspects @xcite ( i.e. , power allocations ) and discrete aspects @xcite ( i.e. , jammers placements ) , but they are necessarily to be solved separately .",
    "moreover , all the above works do not consider the issues of weh and ee for friendly jammers to prolong their lifetime , which are our main focuses .",
    "another important line of this work is the study of competitive ratio of the admitted friendly jammers with instant power allocation in the distributed setting for secure wireless communications for the first time .",
    "we note that existing related works on distributed scenarios only studied the competitive ratio for capacity maximization @xcite and online admission control @xcite in classic wireless communications .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii describes our system model .",
    "section iii proposes the jam - net lifetime maximization problem , we analyze its learning performance in several typical and practical implementations .",
    "section iv focuses on the distributed online jammer placement and power allocation problem with competitive analysis .",
    "we extend our results to the requests with duration and multi - channel scenarios in section v. simulation results are presented in section vi .",
    "the paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "we consider a storage / fence environment model in which legitimate communication takes place within an enclosure specified by one or more polygonal regions @xmath17 , called the storage .",
    "we do not assume any knowledge of the locations of communication links in @xmath0 , but we do assume some properties of legitimate communication described below .",
    "at first , the legitimate transmitters and receivers can be located at any point @xmath18 .",
    "further , there exists a _ controlled region _ , @xmath19 , like the band region that contains @xmath0 in fig .",
    "1 , where there is no eavesdropper able to be within the interior of @xmath20 .",
    "the boundary @xmath21 is referred to as the fence @xmath1 .",
    "outside of @xmath20 is the _ uncontrolled region _",
    "we assume that there is no hole in @xmath20 , which is a union of simply connected regions ; otherwise it can be divided into different regions of storages and fences .",
    "we are necessary to place the jammers distributively in a region @xmath23 called the _ allowable region_. the allowable region permits us to place the jammers at potential restrictions on locations that belong to the region of @xmath24 , e.g. , the guarded distance for secure commutations or locations that are easily reached for maintenance purpose .",
    "we consider the wpt problem with a set of energy sources ( ess ) @xmath25 as legitimate transmitters ( txs ) from the legitimate communication to power a set of friendly jammers @xmath26 with maximal cardinality @xmath27 under all observed time frames .",
    "the ess are assumed to have no restriction to supply the energy request to each jammer , but the served energy must be used energy - efficiently . since ess are geographically randomly distributed and the stochastic placements of jammers , it is desirable to design an online wpt scheduling algorithm ( scheduler ) from ess to jammers for weh over time .",
    "we employ the time - switching protocol as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where a communication frame is divided into the two phases .",
    "the phase of wpt is divided into three sub - phases : i ) perform a time synchronization among all ess to avoid con - channel interference ; ii ) using the idea of time - division multiplexing , the time block of second phase is further divided into micro slots .",
    "online algorithms are necessary , which schedule the weh from a single es @xmath28 a single jammer @xmath29 at each microslot ( short as slot ) @xmath30 based on the observed csi and energy demands from jammers to ess ( detailed below ) ; and iii ) send an ack to indicate the completion of the wpt phase .",
    "the jammers can also initiate the next frame for weh at the end of last frame when their remaining energy - level is lower than some threshold .",
    "hence the wit phase is not necessarily to be launched at each time frame .",
    "let the equivalent complex baseband channel from a es @xmath28 to a jammer @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the fading state of the csi with the instant channel power gain @xmath33 at a micro slot @xmath30 .",
    "for each fading state @xmath32 , the portion of signal power split to secure communication is denoted by @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and that to weh as @xmath36 . in general",
    "the @xmath34 can be adjusted over different fading state over time .",
    "for the wpt phase , the scheduling strategies contains the following two cases , * case * : @xmath37 is perfectly known at ess for each fading state @xmath32 , referred to as the _ known csi at ess _ , which is a simple model but not realistic ; * case * : @xmath37 is unknown at at the ess ( txs ) for all the fading state @xmath32 , referred to as _ unknown csi at ess _ , which is practical problem as the passive jammers usually are not capable to communicate with ess to estimate the csi . in this case",

    "( ) as physical model that only jamming signals cause interference . formally , for a legitimate receiver @xmath83 in @xmath0",

    "similarly , for an eavesdropper @xmath77 , the transmission signal from the storage suffers path loss . in the case",

    "to facilitate successful receptions of legitimate transmissions , we require that @xmath86 , for all points @xmath18 and some specified value of @xmath87 .",

    "we show that significant complexity incurs when making decisions under those `` medium - quality '' ess other the best and worst ess . because the scheduler needs to balance between the instantaneous expected harvest energy rewards and the future rewards , which is very difficult due the coupling effect introduced by the time and energy budgets constraints .",
    "thus , we resort to approximations by relaxing the hard time and energy budget constraints to an average energy budget constraint . now , the problem becomes to maximize the expected rewards ( of total harvest energy ) with average budget constraint @xmath91 .",
    "however , the problem of using the fixed average budget @xmath91 and not taking the remaining time @xmath92 and remaining energy budget @xmath93 into account would not explore the dynamic structure of the problem , which will lead to suboptimal solutions .",

    "we indicate that the performance analysis is non - trivial for the ailp , although the intuition behind the formulation is quite natural . using concentration inequalities",
    ", we can show that @xmath94 under ailp concentrates near the average budget @xmath91 with high probability .",
    "this proves that the proposed ailp algorithms achieves an expected total he only within a constant to the optimum expect for certain boundary cases .",
    "next , gaining the insight from the case of the known statistics of the expected he for each jammer , we extend our analysis to that the expected he as rewards for jammers are unknown . during the analysis , we find that the ailp algorithm only require the ranking of the expected rewards rather than their actual values .",
    "inspired by this , we combine the famous upper - confidence - bound ( ucb ) algorithm @xcite and show that , for the general heterogeneous - energy - demand systems , our proposed @xmath95-ess - jamnet - ucb - ailp algorithm achieves @xmath96 regret that is learning - rate optimal except for certain boundary case , where it achieves @xmath97 regret .      in this subsection",

    "every deterministic online jammer placement algorithm using polynomial power assignments has a competitive ratio ( 1 ) @xmath428-competitive using distance - based power assignments .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof is that every deterministic online jammer placement algorithm has to accept the first jammer that arrives , otherwise it risks having an unbounded competitive ratio .",
    "note that the jamemrs can be replaced over time , we can repeat the following instance sufficiently often and keep a sufficiently large distance between the instances . in this way we can neglect the constant @xmath429 from the competitive ratio .",

    "let the first request have length @xmath430 . from the sir constraints , we bound the minimum distance every other successful jammer request has to keep to the fence @xmath1 .",
    "this yields a blocked area in which the online jammer placement algorithm is not able to accept any request .",
    "we then count the maximum number of requests that can be placed into this region , where the optimum solution can accept simultaneously .    to extend the previous arguments to arbitrary distance - based power assignments , we observe that the previous lower bound uses only requests of length 1 and @xmath430 .",
    "let @xmath431 be the function of the distance - based power assignment , then @xmath432 is the power of the first request .",
    "the lower bound for this power assignment behaves exactly as for a polynomial assignment with @xmath433 .",
    "+ note that when a power assignment is not distance - based , it might assign different powers to small requests based on whether they are near the sender or the receiver of the first request .",
    "this is not helpful since the jammer have a direct interfering link to the eavesdroppers . in this case",
    ", we create the same instance using only undirected requests .",
    "then we get a blocked area of at least @xmath354 for any polynomial power assignment around both points of the first request . using the normalization of powers as before we observe that there is a blocked area of size @xmath354 for any small request , _ no matter which power we assign to it_. this proves the theorem .",
    "[ figure 5 ]",
    "in the previous sections we assumed that requests last forever , analyzing only the spatial aspect of the problem . we now show how our results extend when each request @xmath186 has a duration @xmath434 .",
    "after time @xmath434 an accepted request stops sending and leaves(thus , no longer causing interference ) .",
    "+ we show the modification for the algorithm safe - distance for @xmath355 $ ] .",
    "we adapt the algorithm in the following way .",
    "it accepts a given request @xmath186 if and only if the safe distance @xmath345 holds to all previously accepted requests that are active at some point time in @xmath186@xmath435 duration .",
    "+ our first observation is the following .",
    "if we consider a fixed point in time , an optimal solution opt can have at most @xmath436 more requests than our algorithm , as this corresponds to the spatial problem .",
    "now let @xmath186 be a request accepted by safe - distance with smallest duration possible , that is , @xmath437 .",
    "each request contained in an optimal solution that interferes with @xmath186 is active at least either when @xmath186 starts or when it stops sending .",
    "so it is sufficient to count the accepted requests in opt at both of these points in time to upper bound the number of requests blocked by i , which is @xmath438 .",
    "furthermore , a request @xmath186 with @xmath439 can be split into at most @xmath71 requests of duration 1 , thus blocking at most @xmath440 requests .",
    "the argumentation is similar for other polynomial power assignments and results in an additional factor of @xmath71 in all previously shown bounds .",
    "+ in the case of multiple channels , for @xmath441 , clustering of requests w.r.t .",
    "similar length and duration values can be used to improver the ratio for our algorithm safe - distance to @xmath442 .",
    "choosing @xmath443 , randomsafe - distance becomes @xmath444-competitive .      in this section",
    "we show how to generalize the algorithms above to @xmath28 channels and decrease their competitive ratio .",
    "we propose a @xmath445 , in which we separate the problem by using certain channels only for specific request lengths .",

    "@xmath186 we apply an algorithm outlined above , which makes decisions about acceptance and power of requests assigned to channel @xmath186 . using this separation",
    ", we effectively reduce the aspect ratio to @xmath449 on each channel .",
    "if the optimum solution has to adhere to the same length separation on the channels , this would yield a denominator @xmath28 in the exponents of @xmath430 of the competitive ratios .",
    "obviously , the optimum solution is not tied to our separation , but the possible improvement due to this degree of freedom can easily be bounded by a factor @xmath28 .",
    "this yields the following corollary .",
    "multi - class safe - distance with @xmath28-channel adjustment is @xmath450-competitive using the square - root power assignment .",
    "safe - distance with @xmath28-channel adjustment is @xmath451-competitive for any polynomial assignment with @xmath355 $ ] , and @xmath452-competitive for @xmath453 $ ] .",
    "we conducted preliminary experiments to compare the different numbers of the eavesdroppers .",
    "the setting we have chosen is the storage / fence shown in figure 5 .",
    "the fence is of dimensions @xmath454 units and we placed a grid of @xmath455 cells in the entire region .",
    "we simulated both jam - safedist - power and jam - lifemax in this setting .",
    "for the power assignment from jam - safedist - power , we investigated the difference in number of jammers . finally , we observed the variation in total power assigned with @xmath456 and @xmath237 and the number of jammers palced with @xmath95 , @xmath237 and @xmath457 .",
    "we set the round number t is 300",

    "therefore we can conclude the energy attenuation factor @xmath461 when the @xmath462 .",
    "we chosen the following values : ( i)@xmath463,(ii)@xmath464 , ( iii)@xmath465 . in both numbers of the eavesdroppers , we removed all grid points which were in the forbidden region .",
    "+ for jam - safedist - power , the decline is more steep than the jam - lifemax because of the 300 rounds cause the jam - lifemax data is obtained by repeated average .",
    "the jam - safe - distpower and jam - life - max give the same information about the desired jammers become more and more as the eavesdroppers goes up .",
    "the last two figures about the jam - safedist - multichannel talk us the multichannel give the much less desired jammers but the benefits of multichannel will reduce as the channel grows in number in two different ways based on the @xmath466 .",
