    "the magnetars ( comprising the anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters ; axps and sgrs ) are a small group of x - ray pulsars ( about twenty objects ) , with spin periods between 0.3 and 12 s. their bright x - ray emission ( @xmath1 ) is marginally explained by the commonly accepted emission models for isolated pulsars or by accretion from a companion star . their inferred magnetic fields assuming the spin - down dipolar loss formula ( b = 3.2 @xmath210@xmath3 g",
    ", @xmath4 is the spin period and @xmath5 is the first derivative of spin period ) appear to be in general as high as @xmath6 g . due to these high magnetic fields , the emission of magnetars is thought to be powered by the decay and the instability of their strong fields ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1993 , thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni 2002 ) .",
    "the powerful x - ray output is usually well modelled by thermal emission from the neutron star hot surface ( about 0.20.6kev ) , reprocessed in a twisted magnetosphere through resonant cyclotron scattering , a process favored only under these extreme magnetic conditions . on top of their persistent x - ray emission , magnetars emit very peculiar flares and outbursts on several timescales ( from fractions of seconds to years ) releasing a large amount of energy ( @xmath7 erg ) .",
    "these flares are probably caused by large - scale rearrangements of the surface / magnetospheric field , either accompanied or triggered by displacements of the neutron - star crust ( somehow analogous to quakes on the stellar surface ) .",
