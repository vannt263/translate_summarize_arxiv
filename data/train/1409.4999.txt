    "various studies of the relation between stellar masses and metallicities of star - forming galaxies have outlined their importance for the understanding of cosmic evolution of star - formation rates and galaxy properties . in our investigation",
    "we tie in further information of galaxy structures and morphologies across different environments at z@xmath00.4 . utilizing hst data from the clash program ( postman et al .",
    "2012 ) , we analyze galaxies in the field of 3 very massive clusters macs1206 , macs0329 and macs0416 , complemented by subaru bvriz imaging which maps the large scale environment of the clusters .",
    "we use clash - vlt vimos spectra over the whole area of 30@xmath430 sq.arcmin to measure accurate star - formation rates and oxygen abundances ( gas metallicities ) with 5 strong emission lines [ oii ] , hbeta , [ oiii ] , halpha and [ nii ] ( see maier et al .",
    "2014 ) . to quantify the stellar structure ,",
    "we fit the 2d light distribution of galaxies in subaru images applying the newly developed galapagos2 algorithms ( huler et al . , 2013 ) of the megamorph project",
    "we calculate robust structural parameters over all available subaru bands simultaneously down to masses of @xmath58.5 of 90 cluster and 40 field galaxies . to analyze any morphological dependences",
    ", we classify the galaxies according to four distinct types . for this",
    ", we expand a decision tree ( e.g. nantais et al . 2013 ) to our needs and include the new capabilities of megamorph . in short ,",
    "( b / t)-measurements from 1- and 2-component light profile fittings with varying sets of bulge and disc profiles , as well as color information and visual classifications lead to 4 distinct classes : compact , peculiar , disc - like and objects with smooth , regular structures .",
    "gas metallicities of galaxies depend on their stellar mass : studies of the mass - metallicity ( mz ) relation across a range of redshifts show that galaxies with higher masses form a plateau of higher ( solar - like ) abundances , whereas towards lower masses a negative slope of the mz relation is seen .",
    "both the zero point and slope evolve with redshift ( mannucci et al .",
    "2009 , maier et al .",
    "2014 ) . however , our project is the first to investigate environmental dependencies in very massive clusters ( @xmath6 ) . for z@xmath00.4 galaxies , we measure an average evolution of the mz relation of a factor of 2 but see a shift of the mass threshold below which one finds low metallicities to lower masses for cluster environments .",
    "we also see that at z@xmath00.4 , galaxies of different types are similarly distributed in the mz plot , however subtle differences are visible for higher stellar masses and bigger sizes .",
    "this region is predominantly occupied by the disc - like star - forming population of our sample , both in the field and cluster .",
    "differences due to environmental effects are more obvious : on average , while the most massive field galaxies of our sample follow the local relation reported by tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , a few cluster members exceed solar abundances .",
    "this is independent of their morphological type .",
    "these are the same galaxies we see below the main sequence in the ssfr - mass diagram .",
    "since peculiar galaxies are found at both high and low metallicities , we can speculate that the time scales for any environmental effects on star formation activity must be short ."

    "<S> we further show that our sample falls around an extrapolation of the star - forming main sequence ( the sfr - m@xmath2 relation ) at this redshift , indicating that emission - line selected samples do not have preferentially high star - formation rates ( sfrs ) . </S>",
