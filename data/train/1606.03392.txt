    "in contrast , `` plain '' cnt , i.e. , cnt with a constant surface tension and a commonly used expression for @xmath28 ( see methods ) , underestimates the cavitation rates by more than @xmath72 orders of magnitude .",
    "this shortcoming illustrates the importance of including microscopic information , such as a curvature - dependent surface tension and the correct value of @xmath28 , for the accurate prediction of rates .    by computing the cavitation pressure @xmath65 from the rates shown in fig .",

    "in contrast , the predicted cavitation tension is more negative by about @xmath73 than the data obtained via other experimental techniques would suggest @xcite .",
    "since the simulation setup excludes impurities in the fluid by design , this suggests that cavitation in these cases is indeed heterogeneous as was suspected in previous works @xcite , which explains the significantly lower stability of water under tension in these experiments ( a detailed discussion is provided in the appendix ) .",
    "at ambient temperature and strong tension , bubbles in metastable water are essentially voids in the liquid whose shape can deviate significantly from the assumption of a spherical nucleus made in cnt , depending on their size . nonetheless , provided the dependence of the surface tension on the average curvature is included , the free energetics of bubble formation can be quantitatively described in the framework of cnt .",
    "we find that the curvature contribution favors the cavity over the droplet , i.e. , @xmath74 , in agreement with experimental results @xcite . in light of conflicting results on the sign of @xmath36 in water",
    ", further study is required to elucidate the influence of the chosen water model and biasing towards certain cavity shapes on the obtained value of @xmath36 .    by including the effect of thermal fluctuations in the rayleigh  plesset equation",
    ", we obtain an estimate for the bubble diffusivity that accurately reproduces the pressure dependence found in simulation and scales inversely with the viscosity of the liquid . combining the kinetic pre - factor determined for this diffusivity with the equilibrium bubble density yields a cnt expression for the cavitation rate that reproduces the nucleation rates very well for negative pressures .",
    "however , the microscopic mechanism for cavitation is expected to change for higher pressures and temperatures , where the saturated vapor density is significantly higher than at the temperature studied here . at those conditions , similarly to droplet nucleation @xcite , the transport of molecules across the interface via evaporation and condensation will have a stronger influence on the kinetics of bubble growth , thereby diminishing the influence of viscous damping on the dynamics of the bubble .",
    "the estimate for the cavitation pressure obtained from our rate calculations agrees well with the data from inclusion experiments , thus calling the conflicting results harvested by other techniques into question .",
    "since the latter methods greatly underestimate the stability of water under tension , heterogeneous cavitation due to impurities is a likely explanation for this discrepancy .",

    "seems to reach beyond @xmath238 @xcite .",
    "a first possible explanation for this discrepancy in measured cavitation pressures is that the pressure reported for the inclusion experiments is not correct , because an extrapolated equation of state is used to infer @xmath65 from the fluid density in the inclusion and the temperature @xmath239 at which cavitation occurs .",
    "this explanation was excluded based on direct measurement of the cavitation density @xcite and , more recently , by a direct experimental determination of the pressure reached in inclusions @xcite .",
    "the latter work provides an equation of state down to @xmath240 at around @xmath241 ; a short extrapolation then confirms that pressures close to @xmath242 have been reached the experiments discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "two different scenarios can explain the discrepancy between experiments @xcite : ( i ) either homogeneous cavitation occurs in water close to @xmath237 , and water in inclusions is stabilized by some unknown mechanism , or ( ii ) homogeneous cavitation occurs close to @xmath242 , and , apart from the inclusion work , nucleation occurs heterogeneously in experiments at lower tensions because of ubiquitous impurities .",
    "the cavitation rates obtained in the present work based on molecular simulation of pristine water , which result in @xmath236 , support the second scenario .",
    "this result is in good agreement with density functional theory calculations @xcite , while cnt with the prefactor employed in the rate prediction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] yields a stronger tension of @xmath243 . based on theoretical predictions ,",
    "the second scenario is therefore more likely , although the nature of the impurities inducing cavitation at @xmath237 is still unclear .",
    "a recent shock pulse study @xcite proposes that , for extremely fast pressure ramps , homogeneous cavitation beyond @xmath238 could occur concurrently with heterogeneous cavitation because the bubbles from heterogeneous nucleation forming at around @xmath237 do not have enough time to grow sufficiently to release the tension in the system .",
    "finally , we note that heterogeneous nucleation also occurs in some inclusions .",
    "indeed , in a given quartz sample containing many inclusions with similar liquid density , a wide range of @xmath65 has been observed @xcite .",
    "analyzing the details of the nucleation statistics in a given inclusion @xcite clearly shows that the scatter of nucleation temperatures for a given inclusion is fully consistent with nucleation theory : cavitation is a stochastic event depending on the thermodynamic conditions , the sample volume , and its cooling rate .",
    "however , the distribution of nucleation temperatures in a given inclusion is quite narrow , around @xmath244 , one order of magnitude less than the broad range observed between different inclusions with the same density .",
    "it must be concluded that heterogeneous nucleation ( on dissolved impurities or surface defects ) is responsible for the scatter of @xmath65 in inclusions .",
    "however , in the inclusions with the largest @xmath65 , it is assumed that nucleation occurs homogeneously .",
    "it is of course possible that further experiments would find inclusions exhibiting an even more negative @xmath65 .",
    "however the numerous experiments already performed and the consistent trend observed for the most negative @xmath65 vs. density suggests that the homogeneous nucleation limit has been reached .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath65 in the present work supports that this is indeed the case ."
