    "galaxy clusters have been known and studied for many years , and the radial dependence of cluster temperatures is becoming a testing ground for models of structure formation and for our understanding of gas dynamics .",
    "galaxy clusters are not iso - thermal . instead , the emerging temperature profile is one where the temperature is approximately flat or increases from the centre to some characteristic radius , and then decreases again for larger radii .",
    "the central temperature decrement has been much discussed and the possibility of cooling flows has been explained in excellent reviews  @xcite .",
    "many clusters are well fit with a power law @xmath1 in the very central region  @xcite , with a slope , @xmath2 , between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "numerical simulations are only now beginning to see this central decrement ( see motl et al .   for references ) .",
    "the outer temperature decrease is well established both observationally  @xcite and numerically ( see lin et al .",
    "and references therein ) .",
    "the simulations have even started to provide estimates of the outer temperature decrement which are well fit with power laws in fair agreement with observations .",
    "such non - trivial temperature profiles also affect derived cosmological parameters like the hubble parameter  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect are becoming increasingly accurate  @xcite , however , most analyses of sz observational data are made under the simplifying assumption of iso - thermality .",
    "several groups have considered the ability of future sz observations to extract cluster parameters  @xcite , but always under the assumption of iso - thermality .",
    "we therefore set out to study the effect on the sz derived parameters of non - trivial cluster temperature profiles .    in section",
    "[ sec : sz ] we show that the relevant quantities for sz observations are compton - averaged , in particular we emphasize the difference between the temperatures derived through x - ray and sz observation for clusters which are not iso - thermal . in section  [ sec : cluster ] we use observed and simulated cluster profiles to show that the systematic shift in the derived peculiar velocity , @xmath5 , is of the order @xmath0 .",
    "finally we comment on the possibility of deprojection of sz observed spectra in section  [ sec : onion ] .",
    "the sz effect is dominated by the compton parameter y = _",
    "t n_e dl , where @xmath6 is the thomson cross section , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are number density , temperature and mass of the electrons , and the integral is along the line of sight .",
    "if we extract the radial dependence of the parameters  @xcite @xmath9 then @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11 , where the constant is @xmath12 .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce @xmath13 , in which case we have y = _",
    "similarly , the optical depth is = _ f_n_e dl , with @xmath14 , and one sees that for an iso - thermal cluster , where @xmath15 , one has @xmath16 .    for any cluster observation one receives information from an integral along the line of sight .",
    "since the radial structures of clusters are non - trivial this implies that one may have to define averaged quantities . for x - ray observations the averaging procedure",
    "is often simplified to emission - weighted quantities , scaled by the emissivity which for large temperatures roughly scales  @xcite as @xmath17 _ x = . for the sz effect",
    "the relevant scale is not the emissivity , but instead the local compton parameter , @xmath18 , and therefore the average of @xmath19 is given by _",
    "y = , [ eq : av ] for instance , the average sz temperature for a cluster is t_e _ y = = .",
    "[ eq : avtemp ] we will hereafter only discuss compton - averaged quantities , and hence omit the index on averages .    the sz effect for an iso - thermal cluster is composed of several parts = y ( g(x ) + t_e ( x , t_e ) ) - _ p a(x ) , [ eq : di1 ] where @xmath20 is the bulk motion of the cluster referred to as the peculiar velocity .",
    "the spectral forms due to the thermal up - scattering , @xmath21 , and due to the overall cluster motion , @xmath22 , are well - known  @xcite , and the spectral form of the relativistic corrections to the thermal up - scattering , @xmath23 , is easily calculated  @xcite . to a very good approximation @xmath24 can be taken as independent of temperature ( see e.g. diego et al .  ) , that is , for a given frequency , @xmath25 , one can write @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and higher order terms are subdominant . for the present discussion we can ignore a contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : di1 ] ) of the marginally detectable ultra - relativistic electrons  @xcite , since our findings will not depend on them . for excellent reviews on the sz effect",
    "see  @xcite .    for a cluster with a non - trivial temperature profile eq .",
    "( [ eq : di1 ] ) is written as an integral along the line of sight = dl , [ eq : di ] where the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the local quantities .",
    "now , using the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : av ] ) , this means = y . for an iso - thermal cluster , where @xmath30 , one has @xmath31 , but for a thermally non - trivial cluster there are really 4 independent variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . clearly , for such a cluster the x - ray derived temperature , @xmath34 , may differ significantly from @xmath35 ( as well as , @xmath36 ) , and hence the x - ray derived temperature should only be used with great caution in the study of sz observations .",
    "most studies of sz observations include up to 2 free parameters  @xcite , for instance the compton parameter and the peculiar velocity , and only very few have attempted studies with 3 parameters  @xcite with inclusion of the temperature .",
    "we will here consider the effect of neglecting the non - trivial radial temperature profile , and show that it induces a systematic error on the peculiar velocity of the order @xmath37 .",
    "as a specific example we use a simple cluster model , where the electron density profile follows a @xmath38-model n_e(r ) = n_e^0 ( 1 + ( ) ^2 ) ^-3/2 , [ eq : beta ] where @xmath39 is a characteristic radius .",
    "such broken power - law density profiles are often used to fit observations  @xcite , and are possibly even understood theoretically  @xcite , but may need slight modifications for non - isothermal clusters  @xcite .",
    "the temperature profile may have the shape t_e(r ) = t_e^0 ( 1 + ) ^- , [ eq : tempprof ] where we use results from recent numerically simulated clusters  @xcite with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "for cooling flow clusters the form is slightly more complicated , but an inclusion of the central decrement is straight forward . with these profiles",
    "one finds the average temperature from eq .",
    "( [ eq : avtemp ] ) to be @xmath42 kev when the central temperature is @xmath43 kev , and @xmath44 which indicates that one will find a peculiar velocity which is approximately @xmath45 systematically too large when using sz observations to define the cluster parameters .",
    "we will now test these findings numerically , by constructing and analysing the true sz signal from this cluster model .    with this cluster model , where we normalize the optical depth to @xmath46",
    ", we construct the sz signal along the line of sight through the cluster centre . as a specific example we take an observation with 4 observing frequencies at @xmath47 and @xmath48 ghz , and assume a sensitivity of @xmath49 for each channel .",
    "we choose @xmath50 km / sec .",
    "for optimal observing frequencies  @xcite the statistical error - bars can be reduced slightly ( represented by @xmath51 on figure 1 ) , but the systematic shift ( about @xmath45 ) will remain the same . the systematic shift is independent of the assumed sensitivity , which here is taken slightly optimistic ( act expects a sensitivity of @xmath52 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm    one can now treat this constructed sz signal ( and corresponding error - bars ) as a real observation , and derive the 3 cluster parameters , @xmath53 in the standard way .",
    "this is simply done by inputting the constructed sz signal into the publicly available   sz parameter extraction code sasz  @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 , where we plot both peculiar velocity and temperature on the same figure .",
    "the solid ( red ) line is the relative error on the temperature , @xmath54 , and the dashed ( blue ) line is the relative error on the peculiar velocity , @xmath55 .",
    "as is clear , the average temperature is indeed very near the expected @xmath56 kev , whereas the peculiar velocity is shifted by @xmath57 .",
    "the fact that the sz determined temperature indeed turns out to be the `` correct '' compton weighted temperature implies that accurate prior temperature knowledge ( e.g. from x - ray observations ) would not change the systematic shift of the peculiar velocity . having both accurate temperature and",
    "electron density profiles from x - ray observations would allow one to calculate the systematic shift ( ignoring the complications from an unknown clumping ) .",
    "however , peculiar velocities are most important when derived for a large sample of clusters ( e.g. from an all - sky sz survey ) , but detailed x - ray maps are observationally expensive and can not be made for the large number of clusters expected in future all - sky sz surveys .",
    "the minimal deviation from the derived central value of the temperature arises because @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : di ] ) is not completely independent of the temperature , but this minor effect is not important for our discussion . furthermore , if one imposes a `` known '' temperature of @xmath59 kev ( from x - ray observations ) then that would lead to a @xmath60 systematic shift of @xmath5 , and even a `` known '' emission weighted temperature of @xmath61 kev would give a @xmath62 systematic error on @xmath5 . to be very explicit",
    ", this means that if one knows the exact temperature and electron density profiles from x - ray observations , and then uses the emission weighted temperature in the analysis of sz observations , then one would overestimate the peculiar velocity with @xmath63 for this particular cluster . if a given observation only puts bounds on the peculiar velocity , then the corresponding error - bars are overestimated by the same amount .",
    "this shows , as mentioned earlier , that x - ray observed temperatures should be use with great caution in the study of sz observations .",
    "if one does know the exact temperature and density profiles , then clearly one can calculate @xmath33 , with which one can extract the peculiar velocity correctly .",
    "we thus see that for this specific choice of temperature and electron density profiles the systematic shift in the derived peculiar velocity from sz observations is @xmath64 .",
    "the question now arises : which range in systematic shift is expected for real clusters ?    the density profiles of many clusters are well described by a @xmath38-model with @xmath65 , however , numerical simulations show a rather large scatter in the numerical value for @xmath38 . fixing the temperature profile to the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tempprof ] ) with @xmath66 , and letting @xmath38 vary from @xmath67 to @xmath68  @xcite leads to systematic shifts in the peculiar velocity of @xmath69 to @xmath63 .",
    "one could instead fix the density slope to @xmath70 , and use a polytropic equation of state t_e = t_e^0 ( ) ^-1 , [ eq : poly ] with @xmath71 in the range @xmath72 to @xmath73 . even though the polytropic shape does not provide an excellent fit to observations  @xcite , it is sufficient for estimating the magnitude of the systematic error .",
    "fitting observations with eq .",
    "( [ eq : poly ] ) gives @xmath74 for non - cooling flow clusters , and @xmath75 for cooling flow clusters  @xcite . with @xmath76",
    "one gets a systematic shifts of the peculiar velocity of @xmath63 ( for @xmath77 one gets @xmath78 ) , and for the theoretically extreme case of an adiabatic gas with @xmath79 the error becomes about @xmath80 .",
    "a simple fit to the error in percent of the peculiar velocity as a function of @xmath71 , which is accurate for @xmath81 , gives : error ( in @xmath82 ) @xmath83 .",
    "cluster merging induces bulk motion within the cluster as large as @xmath84 km / sec ( see e.g. sunyaev et al .  ) , and the corresponding mis - estimate of the peculiar velocity is about @xmath37  @xcite , or up to about @xmath85 km / sec  @xcite .",
    "we have seen above that the sz determined peculiar velocity of realistic galaxy clusters may be systematically wrong by @xmath0 , and that x - ray observations can not be expected to solve this problem because they are observationally expensive .",
    "the natural question is then : what is the solution ?    for x - ray observations",
    "the similar problem is solved by the technique of _",
    "deprojection_. this heuristically corresponds to peeling an onion .",
    "the outermost layer is observed and analysed .",
    "then the next layer is analysed while subtracting the signal from the outer layer .",
    "the error - bars will increase for the inner layers , but for x - rays this turns out not to be disastrous .",
    "that is because the contribution from the outer layers is significantly smaller than the contribution from the inner layers , since the emission drops fast with radius @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , for sz observations the relevant quantity is the local compton parameter , which goes like @xmath88 , with @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the error - bars should remain under control even when subtracting contribution to the intensity from outer layers . naturally , the fact that @xmath90 is the reason why sz observations are more suitable than x - ray observations for measuring the outer cluster region .",
    "an advantage for sz deprojection is that the peculiar velocity is the same for the entire cluster when we can ignore the local gas motion ( see however holder  ) .",
    "that means that while normally one would expect to have 3 sz parameters ( @xmath91 ) for each of the @xmath92 radial bins , giving @xmath93 parameters , then we really only have @xmath94 free parameters .",
    "this is important because the major parameter degeneracy for sz observations is between the temperature and peculiar velocity .",
    "thus , the deprojection itself may help reduce the error - bars on the derived parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that spatially resolved sz observations will provide both temperature and electron density profiles , so combined with accurate x - ray observations one can directly measure the radial dependence of clumpiness , which is a non - trivial measure of the merger history .",
    "such sz deprojection of the observed intensity clearly demands that the future sz observations should both have good _ spectral coverage _ and good _",
    "spatial resolution_. that is a non - trivial observational challenge .",
    "we have shown that due to the non - trivial temperature structure of galaxy clusters , the sz derived peculiar velocity will be systematically shifted by @xmath0 .",
    "the compton weighted electron temperature is , however , derived accurately . for future all - sky sz surveys one can not rely on the observationally expensive x - ray observations to remove this systematic error , but",
    "one should instead reach for sufficient angular resolution to perform a deprojection in the sz spectra .",
