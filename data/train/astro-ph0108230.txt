    "isothermal spheres play an important role in astrophysics .",
    "they were initially introduced in the context of stellar structure ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) when composite configurations of stars consisting of an isothermal core and a polytropic envelope were constructed and studied . on larger scales ,",
    "they were applied to stellar systems such as globular clusters and elliptical galaxies ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . the age of globular clusters is such that their isothermal structure is due to a succession of encounters between stars that lead to an equipartition of energy , like in an ordinary gas .",
    "this statistical mechanics prediction has been confirmed by direct observations of globular clusters and is well reproduced by king s models that incorporate a truncation in the distribution function so as to account for tidal effects . in the case of elliptical galaxies ( and possibly other collisionless self - gravitating systems like dark matter ) ,",
    "the isothermal distribution is a result of a `` violent relaxation '' by phase mixing ( lynden - bell 1967 ) . in that case",
    ", there is no segregation by mass contrary to the collisional relaxation . in general ,",
    "violent relaxation is incomplete and the distribution function must be modified at high energies .",
    "however , the distribution function that prevails in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies is isothermal and this is an important ingredient to understand de vaucouleurs @xmath4 law ( hjorth & madsen 1993 ) .",
    "isothermal distributions are also appropriate to describe the cold interstellar medium where the temperature is imposed by the cosmic background radiation at @xmath5 in the outer parts of galaxies , devoid of any star and heating sources ( pfenniger & combes 1994 , de vega _ et al .",
    "they can also be of interest in cosmology to understand the fractal structure of the universe ( saslaw & hamilton 1984 , de vega _ et al .",
    ".    the stability of isothermal gaseous spheres in newtonian gravity has been investigated by antonov ( 1962 ) , lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) and katz ( 1978 ) by using thermodynamical arguments and topological properties of the equilibrium phase diagram by analogy with poincar s theory of linear series of equilibrium .",
    "they showed in particular that , if the energy or the temperature are below a certain threshold , no hydrostatic equilibrium can exist . in that case , the system is expected to undergo a phase transition and collapse .",
    "this is called `` gravothermal catastrophe '' when the energy is kept fixed ( microcanonical ensemble ) and `` isothermal collapse '' when the system evolves at a fixed temperature ( canonical ensemble ) .",
    "the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems was reconsidered by padmanabhan ( 1989 ) who calculated explicitly the second order variations of entropy and reduced the problem of stability to an eigenvalue equation .",
    "his method was applied in the canonical ensemble by chavanis ( 2001 ) who showed in addition the equivalence between thermodynamical stability and dynamical stability based on the navier - stokes equations ( jeans problem ) .",
    "similar studies have been performed by semelin _",
    "et al . _ ( 1999,2000 ) and de vega & sanchez ( 2001 ) by using field theoretical methods .",
    "as shown by padmanabhan ( 1989 ) and chavanis ( 2001 ) , the problem of stability can be studied without approximation almost analytically ( or with graphical constructions ) by making use explicitly of the milne variables introduced long ago in the context of stellar structure ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "we show in the present paper that these methods naturally extend to the context of general relativity .",
    "isothermal gaseous spheres ( in the sense given below ) have been only poorly studied in general relativity despite their similarity with classical isothermal spheres . the most extended study that we have found is the contribution of chandrasekhar at the conference given in the honour of j.l .",
    "synge in 1972 .",
    "his work was completed by yabushita ( 1973,1974 ) who considered the stability of a relativistic isothermal gas surrounded by an external envelope imposing a constant pressure ( an extension of the classical bonnor ( 1956 ) problem ) . in order to make the link with the works of antonov ( 1962 ) and lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) in newtonian gravity",
    ", we shall consider the situation in which the volume is fixed instead of the pressure .",
    "this study can have direct applications to the stability of neutron stars since the equation of state that prevails in the central region of these highly relativistic objects is very close to the `` isothermal '' one .    in section [ sec_antonov ]",
    ", we consider the stability of isothermal gas spheres described by a relativistic equation of state but still using the framework of newtonian gravity .",
    "this is a first attempt to introduce relativistic effects in the classical antonov problem .",
    "in fact , as is well - known , special relativity does not modify the equation of state for a perfect gas ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "only does it alter the onset of instability .",
    "we find that the critical energy below which no hydrostatic equilibrium is possible depends on a relativistic parameter @xmath6 defined as the ratio between the size of the domain @xmath7 and a `` classical '' schwarzschild radius @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the total mass of the system . in the classical limit @xmath10",
    ", we recover the antonov result @xmath11 but when relativistic corrections are included we find that the critical energy is increased , i.e. , instability occurs _ sooner _ than in the classical case .",
    "the density perturbation profile that triggers the instability is calculated explicitly . for @xmath12",
    ", it presents a `` core - halo '' structure but relativistic effects tend to reduce the extent of the halo .",
    "when the system is maintained at a fixed temperature instead of a fixed energy ( canonical description ) , the results are unchanged with respect to the newtonian case .",
    "of course , when the schwarzschild radius becomes comparable to the size of the system , general relativistic effects must be taken into account .",
    "this problem is treated in detail in section [ sec_iso ] .",
    "we consider a simple equation of state @xmath0 ( where @xmath13 is a constant ) which generalizes the equation of state for isothermal spheres in the newtonian context ( the classical limit is recovered for @xmath14 ) .",
    "since the equations governing equilibrium have the same structure and the same properties as in the classical case , we shall say that the system is `` isothermal '' ( following the terminology of chandrasekhar 1972 ) , although this equation of state does not correspond to thermal equilibrium in a strict sense ( see section [ sec_state ] ) .",
    "true statistical equilibria in general relativity have been investigated by katz _",
    "et al . _ ( 1975 ) and they are characterized by a non uniform temperature ( because of the gravitational redshift ) .",
    "however , systems described by the equation of state @xmath0 are numerous in nature and they include for example the important case of neutron cores which are usually modeled as an assembly of cold degenerate fermions for which @xmath1 .",
    "this simple isothermal equation of state is the high - density limit of more general equations of state usually considered for neutron stars ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 , meltzer & thorne 1966 ) .",
    "quite remarkably , our simple `` box '' model is able to reproduce the main properties of these objects .",
    "this suggests that the structure of neutron stars is due intrinsically to their isothermal cores and not to the details of their envelopes ( which are not well - known ) . in section [ sec_osci ]",
    ", we show that the mass - density diagram displays an infinity of mass peaks and that isothermal spheres exist only below a limiting mass corresponding to the first peak . in section [ sec_mr ] ,",
    "we show that the mass - radius diagram has a spiral behavior similar to the one observed for neutron stars . using an equation of pulsation derived by yabushita ( 1973 ) ,",
    "we demonstrate analytically that the series of equilibrium becomes unstable precisely at the point of maximum mass ( like in the study of misner & zapolsky 1964 ) and that new modes of instability correspond to secondary mass peaks .",
    "we obtain the same stability criterion from energy considerations based on the binding energy @xmath15 .",
    "said differently , these results indicate that , for a fixed mass , the system becomes unstable when its radius is smaller than a multiple of the schwarzschild radius , a property consistent with chandrasekhar s ( 1964 ) general theory .",
    "the perturbation profiles of density and velocity are calculated explicitly and expressed in terms of the milne variables .",
    "they do not present a `` core - halo '' structure .",
    "all these properties are strikingly similar to those obtained for classical isothermal spheres in the canonical ensemble ( see , e.g. , chavanis 2001 ) .",
    "this completes the analogy between isothermal spheres and neutron stars investigated by yabushita ( 1974 ) .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath16 particles , each of mass @xmath17 , in gravitational interaction .",
    "we allow the speed of the particles to be close to the velocity of light so that special relativity must be taken into account .",
    "however , in this first approach , we shall treat the gravitational field within the framework of newtonian mechanics .",
    "this procedure is permissible if the typical size of the system is much larger than the schwarzschild radius ( see , e.g , chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the distribution function of the system , i.e. @xmath19 gives the average mass of particles whose positions and momenta are in the cell @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "the integral of @xmath22 over the momenta determines the spatial density @xmath23 and the total mass is expressed as @xmath24 in a meanfield approximation , the total energy is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the kinetic and potential energy respectively . according to the theory of special relativity , the energy of a particule reads @xmath28 this expression",
    "does not include the rest mass , so it reduces to the usual kinetic energy @xmath29 in the newtonian limit .",
    "all the effects of gravity are incorporated in the potential energy which contains the gravitational potential @xmath30 related to the density by the newton - poisson equation @xmath31    we now ask which configuration maximizes the boltzmann entropy @xmath32 subject to the conservation of mass @xmath9 and energy @xmath33 . to that purpose",
    ", we proceed in two steps . in this section ,",
    "we maximize @xmath34 $ ] at fixed @xmath33 , @xmath9 and @xmath35 .",
    "this provides an optimal distribution function expressed in terms of @xmath36 .",
    "then , in section [ sec_first ] , we maximize @xmath37 $ ] at fixed @xmath9 and @xmath33 .",
    "this optimization problem is not trivial and will be further discussed in sections [ sec_equi]-[sec_cond ] .",
    "since the gravitational potential can be deduced from the density by solving the poisson equation ( [ r5 ] ) , maximizing @xmath38 at fixed @xmath33 , @xmath9 and @xmath35 is equivalent to maximizing @xmath38 at fixed @xmath35 and @xmath26 .",

    "their method was , however , limited to the fundamental mode and they could not demonstrate that secondary mass peaks correspond to the change of sign for the next eigenvalues ( see their discussion ) .",
    "our method gives an unambiguous definite answer to that question , at least in the framework of our model .",
    "it has to be noted that these results differ from those obtained by yabushita ( 1974 ) who found that instability occurs _ before _ the first mass peak ( except in the newtonian case @xmath360 ) .",
    "now , the three models only differ in the boundary conditions : ( i ) yabushita s gas spheres have envelopes which exert a constant pressure .",
    "( ii ) in our model , the volume of the isothermal region is assumed to be fixed .",
    "( iii ) misner & zapolsky introduce a more realistic envelope in which the equation of state has a physically admissible form .",
    "our results suggest that imposing a fixed volume ( antonov point of view ) is a better approximation than imposing a fixed pressure ( bonnor point of view ) since it provides the same condition of stability as the reference model of misner & zapolsky ( 1964 ) and other works .",
    "the values of @xmath91 at which a new mode of instability occurs are determined by eq .",
    "( [ con8 ] ) . for large values of @xmath91 ( high order modes )",
    ", we can introduce the asymptotic expansion ( [ em13 ] ) in the milne variables .",
    "then , after some algebra , we find that the values of @xmath413 at which a new instability occurs are asymptotically given by @xmath414 in continuity with the newtonian limit , they follow the geometric progression @xmath415 for @xmath416 the ratio in the geometric progression is respectively @xmath417 , @xmath418 and @xmath419 . it is minimum for @xmath420 with a value @xmath421 .",
    "the profile of the energy density perturbation associated with each instability is obtained by substituting eq .",

    "( [ em4 ] ) and introducing the milne variable @xmath160 , we obtain @xmath422 the zeros of the profile @xmath388 are determined by the intersections between the spiral in the @xmath157 plane and the curve @xmath423 ( see fig . [ uvchi ] ) . the first two zeros are represented on fig .",

    "we see that @xmath424 is always larger than @xmath354 so it does not satisfy the requirement @xmath425 .",
    "therefore , the first mode of instability has only one node at @xmath426 . in other words , the perturbation profile that triggers the instability of an isothermal sphere in general relativity does not present a `` core - halo '' structure ( see fig .",

    "the high order modes of instability have several nodes .",
    "their positions ( for large @xmath208 ) are obtained by expanding the milne variable @xmath160 with the aid of eq .",

    "this yields @xmath427 therefore , the zeros of the perturbation profiles also follow a geometric progression @xmath428 with the same ratio as the dimensionless radii @xmath413 .",
    "we can also determine the velocity profile ( [ p6 ] ) associated with each mode of instability . introducing the velocity of sound @xmath429 and expressing the result in terms of the dimensionless variables defined in section [ sec_emden ] , we get @xmath430 where @xmath206 is given by eq .",
    "( [ con6 ] ) at the critical points . in writing eq .",
    "( [ p7 ] ) , it is implicitely understood that we are just at the _ onset _ of instability ( @xmath431 ) , so that eq .",
    "( [ p7 ] ) is applicable with @xmath432 ( the velocity profile at the critical points , i.e. @xmath433 , is simply @xmath396 ) . in terms of the milne variables , the velocity profile ( [ p7 ] )",
    "can be written @xmath434 for @xmath360 , we recover the expression obtained in the newtonian context from the navier - stokes equations ( chavanis 2001 ) . since @xmath193 , the velocity always vanishes at the center and at the boundary of the domain .",
    "the other zeros , for which @xmath435 , correspond precisely to the values of @xmath91 at which a new mode of instability occurs , i.e. @xmath436 .",
    "the @xmath437 mode of instability therefore has @xmath438 zeros @xmath334 , @xmath439 , @xmath440 , ... , @xmath441 . for high order modes of instability ,",
    "the zeros follow asymptotically the geometric progression ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "it has often been suggested on the basis of phenomenological arguments that the baryon number @xmath16 , or equivalently the rest mass @xmath442 , is also maximum at the onset of instability .",
    "we wish to check this prediction explicitly in the case of an isothermal gas sphere .",
    "the baryon number is obtained by multiplying the baryon number density @xmath265 by the _ proper _ volume element @xmath443 and integrating the resulting expression over the whole configuration .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , we get ( see , e.g. , weinberg 1972 ) @xmath444 now , according to the equations of state ( [ s4])-([s6 ] ) , the baryon number density is related to the energy density by @xmath445 introducing the dimensionless variables defined in section [ sec_emden ] , we find that the baryon number can be written @xmath446 with the normalization constant @xmath447    the baryon number ( [ n3 ] ) is ploted versus the central density on fig .",
    "[ chiandn ] for @xmath1 .",
    "it exhibits damped oscillations , like the total mass energy , and tends asymptotically to the value @xmath448 as @xmath449 ( singular sphere ) .",
    "it is observed numerically that the peaks of mass - energy and of baryon number occur for the _ same _ values of the central density ( we have checked this property for various values of @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is also clear from fig .",
    "[ transition ] where the mass - energy @xmath9 is ploted as a function of the baryon number @xmath16 . from this figure",
    ", we can understand physically why the system becomes unstable after the first mass peak . indeed ,",
    "for a given rest mass @xmath450 there exist several solutions with different energy @xmath451 .",
    "only the solution with the lowest energy ( `` fundamental '' state ) is stable with respect to radial perturbations ( see weinberg 1972 ) .",
    "we expect therefore some phase transitions to occur for a state of high energy to a state of lower energy ( see the arrow on fig . [",
    "transition ] ) .",
    "therefore , only the lower branch is stable and it corresponds to the configurations prior to the first mass peak ( we come to the same conclusion by minimizing the binding energy @xmath452 at fixed mass @xmath9 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with those found by tooper ( 1964 ) for polytropic gas spheres .",
    "we shall now reformulate the previous results in a different form by introducing appropriate length scales .",
    "this will provide a direct comparison with our discussion in the newtonian context ( chavanis 2001 ) . in general relativity ,",
    "a gaseous sphere of mass @xmath9 is unstable if its radius is _ smaller _ than a multiple of the schwarzschild radius ( chandrasekhar 1964 ) . for a confined isothermal gas ,",
    "this condition is explicitly given by eq .",
    "( [ o8 ] ) which can be rewritten @xmath453 on the other hand , in newtonian gravity , the condition of gravitational collapse is that the size of the domain be _ larger _ than the jeans length @xmath454 .",
    "for example , in the case of an isothermal gas confined within a box , the condition of instability reads ( de vega & sanchez 2001 , chavanis 2001 ) @xmath455 it should be emphasized that these inequalities characterize the _ absence _ of hydrostatic equilibrium for an isothermal sphere .",
    "this is more stringent than the instability of an equilibrium configuration ( see below ) .",
    "although the sense of these inequalities is opposite , there is no contradiction since the size of the domain enters explicitly in the definition of the jeans length ( through the average density ) . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the two criteria become equivalent as we now show . in the classical limit",
    ", the rest mass dominates the kinetic energy so that @xmath456 where @xmath457 is the classical mass density .",
    "therefore , the equation of state ( [ s6 ] ) becomes @xmath458 and it must be compared with the equation of state of a classical isothermal gas @xmath459 . this yields @xmath460 now , in the classical limit @xmath461 , the critical parameter @xmath462 , given by eq .",
    "( [ o7 ] ) , diverges like @xmath463 while the schwarzschild radius @xmath257 goes to zero in such a way that the product @xmath464 remains finite .",
    "therefore , the inequality ( [ l1 ] ) is _ reversed _ @xmath465 and we recover the result ( [ l2 ] ) with @xmath466 .",
    "it can be noted that the same criterion can be written @xmath467 therefore , a classical gaseous sphere of radius @xmath7 and temperature @xmath77 can exist only below a limiting mass @xmath468 given by formula ( [ l5 ] ) . obviously , the physical origin of this limiting mass is the same as for the limiting mass of neutron stars but with a completely different interpretation of the parameters .",
    "it is also relevant to introduce another length scale @xmath469 which gives a good estimate of the `` core radius '' of a relativistic isothermal gas sphere . in the classical limit",
    ", @xmath470 reduces to the king s length ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in terms of the core radius , the parameter @xmath91 can be written @xmath471 the condition of instability @xmath410 is therefore equivalent to @xmath472 above this threshold , it is still possible to construct isothermal gas spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium but they are unstable .",
    "secondary instabilities occur for radii that follow a geometric progression @xmath473 in the newtonian context , this hierarchy of scales was interpreted by semelin _",
    "( 1999 ) and chavanis ( 2001 ) in relation with the fragmentation of the interstellar medium and the possible origin of its fractal structure .    the instability criteria ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l8 ] ) , expressed in terms of distinct length scales , can also be expressed in terms of the redshift , with a similar distinction between the central redshift and the surface redshift . according to eq .",
    "( [ mr11 ] ) , the surface redshift @xmath474 is an increasing function of the mass energy @xmath352 while the central redshift @xmath475 , deduced from eq .",
    "( [ em17 ] ) , is an increasing function of the central density @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the surface redshift must necessarily satisfy @xmath476 since no hydrostatic equilibrium of isothermal spheres can exist above this threshold while the central redshift must satisfy @xmath477 because configurations with @xmath412 exist mathematically but are unstable .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the structure and the stability of isothermal gas spheres in the framework of general relativity .",
    "we have found that the relativistic isothermal spheres ( like neutron cores ) exhibit the same kind of behaviors as newtonian isothermal spheres but with a different interpretation of the parameters . in this analogy ,",
    "the critical energy and the critical temperature found by antonov ( 1962 ) and lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) for an isothermal gas are the classical equivalent of the limiting mass for neutron stars discovered by oppenheimer & volkoff ( 1939 ) [ there also exists a limiting mass for classical isothermal gas spheres , see eq .",
    "( [ l5 ] ) ] .",
    "similarly , the spiral behavior of the temperature - energy curve for a classical gas has the same origin as the mass - radius diagram in neutron stars .",
    "this spiral behavior , as well as the damped oscillations of the mass - density profile , are general features of isothermal configurations .",
    "although our model can reproduce qualitatively all the features of neutron stars , it is however limited in its applications since the isothermal core is surrounded by an artificial `` box '' instead of a more physical envelope like in the studies of oppenheimer & volkoff ( 1939 ) , misner & zapolsky ( 1964 ) and meltzer & thorne ( 1966 ) .",
    "however , this simplification allows us to study the stability problem analytically ( or with graphical constructions ) without any further approximation .",
    "this is a useful complement to the more elaborate works of the previous authors who had to solve the pulsation equation numerically or with approximations .",
    "this is also complementary to the study of yabushita ( 1974 ) who considered isothermal gas spheres surrounded by an envelope exerting a constant pressure .",
    "the boundary conditions are of importance since yabushita came to the conclusion that the onset of instability occurs before the first mass peak .",
    "in contrast , our model gives a stability criterion consistent with that of misner & zapolsky ( 1964 ) and other works .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the energy density at the edge of the isothermal core has a value @xmath478 ( a typical prediction of nuclear models ) , we can reproduce almost quantitatively the results usually reported for neutron stars .",
    "it should be stressed that the analogy between neutron stars and isothermal spheres is a pure effect of general relativity . when gravity is treated in the newtonian framework",
    ", the classical condition of hydrostatic equilibrium requires a relationship between the pressure and the mass density @xmath479 which , for dense matter ( degenerate and relativistic ) , is a power law with index @xmath480 ( see chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "however , when gravity is treated in the framework of general relativity , the oppenheimer - volkoff equations require a relationship between the pressure and the mass - energy density @xmath239 which , for dense matter , is linear .",
    "therefore , the core of neutron stars ( treated with general relativity ) is `` isothermal '' while the core of white dwarf stars approaching the limiting mass ( treated in a newtonian framework ) is `` polytropic '' , although the same equation of state is used ( that for a completely degenerate and ultra - relativistic ideal fermi gas ) .",
    "this is the intrinsic reason why the mass - radius relation for neutron stars exhibits a spiral behavior ( meltzner & thorne 1966 ) while the mass - radius relation for white dwarf stars is monotonous ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "these remarks may increase the interest of studying isothermal gas spheres both in newtonian mechanics and in general relativity .",
