    "this is the second paper in a series that re - analyze the supernova ( sn ) sample assembled by the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; @xcite ) in order to constrain sn progenitor models . in paper",
    "i , we remeasured the loss sn rates ( first measured by @xcite ) and found that the ratio between the rates of stripped - envelope supernovae ( se  sne ; i.e. , sne  iib , ib , ic , broad - lined ic or ic - bl , and peculiar examples of these subtypes ; see for a review ) and sne ii ( i.e. , sne iip , iil , iin , and peculiar examples of these subtypes ) was smaller , by a factor of @xmath4 , in galaxies with stellar masses @xmath0 than in more massive galaxies .",
    "the sn rates in paper i can be regarded as `` absolute '' rates ",
    "they measured how many sne , of a given type , explode per unit time per unit mass . in this paper , we use a subsample of the loss sn sample to measure the fractions of different sn subtypes within this sample .",
    "these fractions can be thought of as `` relative '' rates ",
    "they measure what fraction of all sne that explode in nature are of a given subtype .",
    "if relative rates are measured from a sn sample that is complete within a given volume ( i.e. , `` volume - limited '' ) , and the host galaxies of these sne are representative of the galaxy luminosity function within that volume , the realtive sn rates should correlate with the relative rates of their respective progenitor stars . throughout this work ,",
    "we use the terms `` relative rates '' and fractions interchangeably .",
    "the subsample of the full loss sn sample we used here was constructed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l11 ) to measure sn luminosity functions and relative rates .",
    "this sample is complete to all core - collapse ( cc ) sne out to 60 mpc and sne ia out to 80 mpc ( and hence is volume - limited ) .",
    "we describe this sample in detail in section  [ sec : galaxies ] .",
    "recently , shivvers et al .",
    "( in prep . ) reclassified the sne in this sample and found that sne ib , which l11 initially suggested were roughly half as common as sne ic , are actually @xmath5 times as common .",
    "@xcite used the l11 sample to argue that for a standard initial mass function ( imf ) , wolf - rayet stars could account for only half of the observed fractions of se sne .",
    "however , in that work , the authors took a conservative tack and treated the loss sn relative rates as monolithic , in the sense that the same rates applied to all types of galaxies . in paper",
    "i , we showed that galaxies with stellar masses lower than @xmath6 were less efficient at producing se sne than more massive galaxies . in section",
    "[ sec : vol_lim ] , we split the loss volume - limited sample according to this mass criterion to test whether the same trend is evident in the relative sn rates . if so , we expect to see a lower fraction of se sne in galaxies with @xmath7 .    in paper",
    "i , we calculated the rates of sne ia , se sne , and sne ii . here , we further subdivide these sn types into various subtypes ( e.g. , se sne into sne ib , ic , ic - bl , iib , etc . ) and measure the relative rates of each subtype .",
    "we further compare the relative rates of each subtype in low- and high - mass galaxies , using different mass cuts .",
    "we find that sne ib and ic are underrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative rates of sne iib are consistent between low - mass and high - mass galaxies .",
    "there are @xmath2 times more sn impostors in low - mass galaxies than in high - mass galaxies ( but this might be due to a selection effect ) .",
    "the low - mass galaxies also host the only sn 1987a - like sne in the loss volume - limited sample .",
    "importantly for cosmology , normal sne ia are more common in low - mass galaxies .",
    "these results are in stark contrast to those of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a10 ) , who used a preliminary sample of 70 sne from the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; @xcite ) to show that sne iib and sne ic - bl are overrepresented in dwarf galaxies by a large factor , while sn ib fractions are consistent with each other in both dwarf and giant galaxies .",
    "we discuss the differences between their results and ours in detail in section  [ subsec : vol_ptf ] .",
    "although @xcite also measured sn relative rates , we do not compare the results shown here to theirs .",
    "first , their sample consisted of all sne whose discovery was made public , through international astronomical union circulars , between 1998 january 1 and 2008 june 30 out to 28 mpc . as these sne were discovered by different surveys",
    ", the completeness of this sample is unknown .",
    "second , @xcite did not split their sample according to either the mass ( as done here ) or the luminosity ( as in a10 ) of their sn host galaxies . for a discussion of the differences between the overall loss relative rates from l11 and the rates reported by @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "relative sn rates measured from a complete sample can also be compared to absolute sn rates from volumetric surveys of the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite and our paper i ) .",
    "combined sn samples from five different surveys and measured sn ia , se sn , and sn ii rates in galaxies of different morphological types . however , owing to the small number of se sne in their sample , it is hard to draw any conclusions regarding this family of sne , and we do not compare our results to theirs .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "for a full description of the loss sample , we refer the reader to paper i and to @xcite .",
    "the loss volume - limited sample is `` volume - limited '' in the sense that the authors assume that , given their detection efficiency , they did not miss any sne that exploded within the galaxies targeted by loss out to 80 mpc for sne ia and 60 mpc for cc sne .",
    "as shown in figure 4 of l11 and discussed in their section  2.5 , loss achieved a completeness of @xmath8% for sne ia within 80 mpc , but only @xmath9% for cc sne within 60 mpc . to overcome this problem , l11 measured a completeness correction for each sn in the sample based on its light curve and their detection efficiency .",
    "shivvers et al .",
    "( in prep . ) reclassified the l11 sample using all currently available spectra and the knowledge that has accrued about sn classification since the original publication of l11 ; see their table 1 for a detailed summary of the new classifications .",
    "the volume - limited sample used here contains 180 sne and sn impostors comprising 74 sne ia , 34 se sne , 65 sne ii , and seven sn impostors .",
    "our definition of se sne has changed slightly between paper i and this work . in paper",
    "i , where we used the original control times from @xcite to measure sn rates , we followed @xcite and did not include sne iib in the se sn category . here , this is no longer necessary , and se sne refer to all sne iib , ib , ic , ic - bl , `` ca - rich , '' and peculiar se sne .",
    "likewise , sne ii refer to all sne iip , iil , iin , sn 1987a - like sne , and peculiar sne ii . as in paper",
    "i , we group sne iip and iil into one subtype .",
    "we use the same definition for sne ia as in shivvers et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , which includes all normal sne ia , subluminous sn 1991bg - like sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , overluminous sn 1991t - like ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and sn 1999aa - like sne ( which fall between normal sne ia and sn 1991t - like sne ; @xcite ) , sn 2002cx - like sne ( @xcite ; also called sne iax@xcite ) , and sn 2002es - like sne ( which have shared properties with both sn 1991bg - like and sn-2002cx - like sne ; @xcite ) .    - and @xmath10-band luminosities of all loss sn host galaxies and their stellar masses .",
    "the stellar masses are more tightly correlated with the @xmath10-band , rather than the @xmath11-band , luminosities .",
    "the estimated stellar masses of the 21 loss galaxies in the volume - limited sample without such values are shown as black squares .",
    "the vertical error bars denote the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distributions of stellar masses in a bin of width 0.2 dex centered on either the @xmath11- or @xmath10-band luminosities of those galaxies.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    @xcite used @xmath11- and @xmath10-band photometry to estimate the stellar masses , @xmath12 , of the loss galaxies ( see appendix a in paper i ) , but 21 of the sn host galaxies in the volume - limited sample lacked stellar mass estimates .",
    "discarding these galaxies would render the volume - limited sample unusable in this work , as the lack of mass measurements is not correlated with the fractions of the sne in the sample , so that the fractions of the remaining sne would no longer correspond to the true fractions in nature .",
    "fortunately , none of the host galaxies lacked both @xmath11- and @xmath10-band data . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass2 ] , we plot the loss stellar masses as a function of luminosity , from which it is apparent that the correlation between the stellar masses and the @xmath10-band luminosity ( @xmath13 ) is tighter than with @xmath14 , with pearson correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.75 , respectively .",
    "for each of the 21 galaxies without loss masses , we use the median of the distribution of stellar - mass values in a bin of width 0.2 dex centered on either the @xmath14 or @xmath13 luminosity of each galaxy , and take the 16th and 84th percentiles as the uncertainties of the measurement .",
    "we note that the galaxies with missing masses are spread throughout the mass range of the sample , so that our estimates of the missing masses should not add a systematic bias to our analysis below . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass1 ] , we show distributions of the masses for all host galaxies in the volume - limited sample , as well as separately for sne ia , sne ii , se sne , and sn impostors .    as in paper i ,",
    "all stellar masses measured by loss have been divided by @xmath15 to be consistent with masses measured by the mpa - jhu galspec pipeline @xcite for loss galaxies that were also observed by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .     to maintain consistency with sdss galspec mass values.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "the deficiency of se sne in low - mass galaxies observed in paper i is also noticeable in the relative rates of different sn types in the volume - limited sample , once the sn host galaxies are split according to their stellar mass , at @xmath16 .    to account for the uncertainty of the mass values we assigned to the 21 galaxies that did not have such values originally , as well as the uncertainty in the classification of some sne ( e.g. , sn 2002ds",
    "is either a sn ii or a sn iib ) , we run 1,000 monte carlo simulations to measure the uncertainties of each sn fraction . each sn is assigned a classification weight : 1 if the classification is certain , or a fraction of 1 , depending on the number of possible classifications . to test for the effect of filling in the missing masses , we vary their value according to the probability density function of the distribution of masses from which they were drawn .",
    "the sne then find themselves on either side of the mass threshold .",
    "the final step requires summing the number of sne of each subtype , dividing by the total number of sne , and estimating the uncertainties on the resultant fraction .",
    "the last step should be a simple ratio of two poisson distributions , but is complicated by the need to multiply each sn by its individual completeness correction , as measured by l11 . to take these corrections into account",
    ", we treat each sn as being drawn from a poisson distribution with an expectation value of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in each step of the monte carlo simulation , an individual sn effectively takes on a value drawn from the poisson distribution .",
    "this value is then multiplied by the completeness correction and classification weight of the sn it represents , and summed with the other sne of its subtype .",
    "we divide this sum by the total number of sne ( in this case , the sum of the medians of all sn subtypes ) .",
    "finally , we take the median of the resultant distribution as the value of the sn fraction and the 16th and 84th percentiles as its 68% uncertainty .",

    "the probability of measuring an underabundance , @xmath19 , of sne of a given subtype in a sample of @xmath20 galaxies ( or an overabundance , @xmath21 , of sne of the same subtype in the other @xmath22 galaxies ) is calculated according to @xmath23 where we vary the intrinsic sn fraction ( @xmath24 ) between 0 and 1 , assuming that it is independent of the host - galaxy s stellar mass . a difference between relative rates of a given sn subtype ( and hence ,",
    "a rejection of the assumption that @xmath24 is the same in all galaxy types ) is considered statistically significant if the maximal probability of it occuring by chance is @xmath25 .",
    "based on the resultant probabilities , we find that , as one family , sne ii are overrepresented in low - mass galaxies .",
    "se sne and sne ia may be underrepresented in those galaxies , but the samples are too small for a definitive conclusion .",

    "sne ib are underrepresented , by a factor of @xmath26 , in galaxies with @xmath27 .",
    "the fraction of sne ic in low - mass galaxies is formally smaller by a factor of @xmath28 , though the difference is not statistically significant . as classifying sne as either sne ib or ic is not always straightforward ( e.g. , @xcite ; shivvers et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", we also calculate the fractions of sne ib and ic , combined .",
    "the latter fraction is @xmath29 times smaller in low - mass galaxies and is statistically significant .",
    "this result is consistent with our finding in paper i that the ratio between the se sn and sn ii absolute rates is lower in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath1 relative to the ratio in high - mass galaxies .",
    "shivvers et al .",
    "( in prep . ) found that the ratio of sne ib to sne ic is @xmath30 . from table  [ table : fractions ] , it would seem that this ratio , which is @xmath31 in high - mass galaxies , is reversed in low - mass galaxies .",
    "we caution not to attribute any significance to this reversal , as the low - mass galaxies contain only one sn ib and two sne ic , leading to a ratio of @xmath32 .",
    "this ratio is consistent , at @xmath33 , with the sn ib / ic ratio of @xmath34 in high - mass galaxies .",
    "intriguingly , the sn iib fractions are consistent between the two galaxy populations .",
    "we note that it should be as easy to discover sne iib as it is to discover sne ib and ic , as their luminosity functions and light curves are similar ( e.g. , l11 ; @xcite ; though see regarding faster rise times for sne ic and ic - bl , relative to sne ib and iib ) .",
    "thus , we do not think that the different trends for sne ib+ic and sne iib could be due to loss having systematically missed any of these sn subtypes .",
    "l11 did not compute completeness corrections for the sn impostors in the volume - limited sample , so they are not included in figure  [ fig : pie ] and table  [ table : fractions ] .",

    "if we were to count these objects as cc sne ( as they could be cc sn progenitors at the end of their lives ) , then , without completeness corrections , they would account for @xmath37% and @xmath38% of cc sne in low- and high - mass galaxies , respectively .",
    "in other words , sn impostors are overrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath2 , a statistically significant result ( with a probability of @xmath39% ) .",
    "this result is consistent with , who find that sn impostors explode in lower - metallicity environemnts than sne iin .",
    "however , in our sample this result can also be due to a selection effect , as sn impostors are generally fainter than sne and so would be easier to pick out in lower - mass , lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "normal sne ia are overrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "we note that while the lack of sn 1991bg - like sne in the low - mass galaxies is consistent with the large fraction ( 18% ) found in high - mass galaxies , in the latter , the sn 1991bg - like sne seem to cut into the fraction of normal sne ia",
    ". it will be interesting to see if this effect persists in a larger sample .",
    "if it does , it reinforces the suggestion made by @xcite that in order to collect a homogeneous sample of sne ia for cosmological purposes , one would be best served targeting low - mass galaxies , as opposed to star - forming galaxies  without regard to their mass  as advocated by @xcite .    to test the sensitivity of our results to the value of the mass cut ,",
    "we repeat the above exercise with two different mass cuts : @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( the last value is motivated by the mass of the large magellanic cloud , or lmc , which is often treated as the upper mass limit of dwarf galaxies ; @xcite ) .",

    "when using the higher mass cut at @xmath41 , we find that sne ia are significantly underrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath43 and sne ii are overrepresented by a factor of @xmath44 , whereas before they were consistent between the two samples . sne ib and ic ( individually and combined ) are still deficient in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath1 ( this result for sne ic is still insignificant ) .",
    "although the formal ratio between sne iib in high- and low - mass galaxies is @xmath45 , the two relative rates are still consistent ( whereas in a10 they were underrepresented by a factor of 5 , as we discuss in section  [ subsec : vol_ptf ] , below ) .",
    "sn 1987a - like sne are still only found in low - mass galaxies , but this result is no longer significant .",
    "the difference between normal sne ia in low- and high - mass galaxies is still significant .",
    "sn 1991bg - like sne are still only found in high - mass galaxies , and this result is now significant .",
    "the lower mass cut at @xmath42 reduces the number of sne in low - mass galaxies to the point where only one difference between the galaxy samples is significant : an overabundance of sne iin in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "formally , sne iib are roughly twice as common in low - mass galaxies , but the relative rates of this sn subtype are still consistent between the two galaxy samples .",
    "the three mass cuts used here show that the most robust trends are the deficiency of sne ib and ic , along with the overabundance of normal sne ia , in low - mass galaxies .",
    "these trends are also qualitatively present when the lowest mass cut is used , but are no longer significant as the low - mass sn sample is reduced to the point where it is dominated by poisson noise .",
    "the following trends also stand out no matter the mass cut used , but are only significant when one of the mass cuts is used : ( 1 ) sn 1987a - like sne prefer low - mass galaxies ; and ( 2 ) sn 1991bg - like sne are only found in high - mass galaxies .",
    "finally , the relative rates of sne iib are consistent with each other in both low- and high - mass galaxies , independent of which mass cut is used .      although the loss volume - limited sample is complete to all sne within 60 mpc , the galaxy sample itself is not complete  that is , it is not an accurate representation of the galaxy luminosity distribution within the volume it probes . as figure 1 from @xcite shows , both the full loss sample and the volume - limited subsample are complete down to galaxies with @xmath10-band absolute magnitudes of @xmath47 mag , but deficient in lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "this deficiency , which is also apparent in the galaxy distributions shown in the various rate figures in paper i , is caused by the targeted nature of the loss survey .",
    "we do not think that this incompleteness is the source of the deficiency we observe in the sn ib and sn ic relative rates in low - mass ( and hence low - luminosity ) galaxies .",
    "first , as @xcite note , low - luminosity galaxies , which have low star - formation rates , do not produce many sne .",
    "they estimate that only @xmath48% of cc sne and @xmath49% of sne ia are missed in the volume - limited sample .",
    "second , as figure  [ fig : mass1 ] shows , the loss volume - limited sample is not bereft of low - mass galaxies : @xmath50% ( @xmath51% once the missing masses are filled in ) of the host galaxies have stellar masses @xmath52 .",
    "third , we have no reason to think that the low - luminosity galaxies included in loss , and the sne they hosted , are in any way uncharacteristic of the overall low - luminosity galaxy population , so the rates we measure , while suffering from large statistical uncertainties , should not be systematically biased by the galaxy sample s incompleteness .",
    "we use the l11 compelteness corrections , which were calculated using light - curve templates ( also constructed by l11 ) , based on the classification of each sn .",
    "though some of the classifications have changed , we do not re - calculate the corrections , as ( 1 ) only a small fraction of the classifications have changed , and ( 2 ) the luminosity functions and light curves of sne ib , ic , and iib ( the sn types that were most affected by the classification changes in shivvers et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "are very similar .",
    "@xcite have argued that the relative rates of sne iax measured by l11 were underestimated , as the sne iax in the loss sample were all high - luminosity objects ( brighter than @xmath53 mag at peak ) .",
    "since we rely on the l11 completeness corrections , our fractions of sne iax suffer from the same bias .",
    "however , as in this paper we compare relative sn rates in galaxies of different masses , and as the differences we find for sne iax are not statistically significant , we do not attempt to correct for this bias .",
    "a10 split a preliminary sample of 70 ptf sne among `` giant '' and `` dwarf '' host galaxies , defined by the galaxies @xmath54-band luminosities .",
    "our findings contradict theirs on four main points , as follows .    1",
    ".   they found that the overall fraction of all se sn types is larger in low - mass galaxies ; we find the opposite .",
    "2 .   they found no difference between the relative rates of sne ib in giants and dwarfs , while we find a marked deficiency of sne ib in low - mass galaxies .",
    "they found a deficiency of sne iib in giant galaxies .",
    "we find no difference between the fractions of this sn subtype in low- and high - mass galaxies .",
    "they found that sne ic - bl are over - represented in dwarf galaxies , where they accounted for 13% of all sne .",
    "this result was based on two sne ic - bl in dwarf galaxies and one in giant galaxies .",
    "our sample includes a similar number of 12 sne ic - bl , but we find no significant difference between the fractions of this sn in the two galaxy types .",
    "however , due to the makeup of our sn sample , sne ic - bl only account for @xmath55 of all sne in low - mass galaxies , an order of magnitude less than in a10 .    though the loss volume - limited sample is slightly larger than the ptf sample ( 99 cc sne vs. 70 ) , any conclusions drawn from the loss and ptf samples are both constrained by small - number statistics .",
    "however , the loss volume - limited sample is better suited to the job at hand , as it represents a complete sample and includes completeness corrections based on the survey s sensitivity to each sn in the sample .",
    "the ptf sample , on the other hand , is incomplete , as its detection efficiency for different types of sne is unknown .",
    "it is also unknown how well the ptf sn host galaxies represent the local galaxy luminosity function .",
    "that said , whereas the loss survey targeted massive galaxies , the ptf survey was untargeted , and so more sensitive to dwarf galaxies .    finally , it is important to note that in this work we split the sn host galaxies by their stellar mass , and define low - mass galaxies as having stellar masses @xmath52 .",
    "this threshold includes both `` dwarf '' galaxies , which are often defined as being less massive than the lmc at @xmath42 , and some `` giant '' galaxies .",
    "a10 split their sample according to the @xmath54-band luminosity of the galaxies , with dwarf galaxies defined as being fainter than @xmath56  mag .",
    "of the galaxies in the loss volume - limited sample , @xmath57% ( @xmath58% once missing masses are filled in ) can be defined as dwarfs according to their mass . on the other hand , @xmath59% of the ptf galaxies",
    "are defined as dwarfs .",
    "thus , while the loss sample does probe sne in dwarf galaxies , the ptf sample is more sensitive to them",
    ".    it will be interesting to see whether a complete sample of sne assembled from either the full ptf or asas - sn ( all - sky automated survey for supernovae ; @xcite ) searches would confirm or contradict the trends described here .",
    "this is the second of a series of papers that further explore the implications of the loss sn rates . here",
    ", we examined the relative rates of different sn subtypes in the volume - limited loss sample .",
    "this sample , which contains 180 sne and sn impostors , is complete for sne ia out to 80 mpc and cc sne out to 60 mpc .",
    "our analysis was based on a re - classification of the sne in this sample ( shivvers et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . where l11 originally did not discriminate between galaxy types , we split the loss volume - limited sample into two galaxy samples , using different mass cuts , and compared the relative rates of different sn subtypes in low- and high - mass galaxies .",
    "this split was motivated by our finding in paper i that the absolute rates of se sne , relative to sne ii , are lower in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "we have found the following trends ( figure  [ fig : pie ] ) .    1",
    ".   sne ib are underrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of 36 . taken together ,",
    "sne ib and ic are underrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "both results are statistically significant , given our significance threshold of 5% .",
    "2 .   on the other hand , the relative rates of sne iib are consistent with each other in both low- and high - mass galaxies .",
    "sn 1987a - like sne prefer low - mass galaxies .",
    "sn impostors , many of which could signify the death throes of cc sn progenitors , are overrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "this , however , could be due to selection effects , as the sn impostors in the loss volume - limited sample have not been corrected for completeness , and these objects tend to have lower peak luminosities than sne .",
    "normal sne ia are overrepresented in low - mass galaxies by a factor of @xmath40 , a significant result .",
    "as expected , subluminous sn 1991bg - like sne are only found in high - mass galaxies , but , intriguingly , they cut into the share of the normal sne ia .",
    "we find that trends 1 and 5 are the most robust to the choice of mass cut , followed by trends 3 and 6 . though not formally statistically significant , trend 2 is qualitatively present no matter which mass cut is used .",
    "the underrepresentation of sne ib and ic in low - mass galaxies strengthens our finding in paper i that the se sn rates , relative to the sn ii rates , are lower in low - mass galaxies than in high - mass galaxies . in the latter type of galaxy , we find the same fraction of sne ib and ic , combined , as @xcite did .",
    "this strengthens their point that single stars , on their own , can not account for the observed fractions of se sne , at least in high - mass galaxies .",
    "this is true if one were to assume that all galaxies have the same imf .",
    "recent studies , however , have reported that galaxies with higher star - formation rates show more top - heavy imfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we leave it to a future paper to explore whether the larger fraction of massive stars produced by such imfs could account for the higher fraction of sne ib and ic we observe in high - mass ( and hence highly star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "it is interesting that the relative rates of sne iib are consistent between low- and high - mass galaxies .",
    "this adds another reason why the exclusion of this type of sn from the se sn rates in paper i should not bias our findings in that paper .",
    "it also raises the question whether sne iib come from different progenitors than other se sne .",
    "if , instead , sne iib , ib , and ic all come from the same type of progenitor stellar system , it remains to be seen what property ( or combination of properties , such as metallicity , imf , or binarity fraction ) of galaxies at @xmath7 could hinder the production of sne ib and ic , but not of sne iib .",
    "a larger sample of se sne in low - mass galaxies is required to test whether at a lower mass cut the fractions of sne iib will remain the same or will begin to exhibit the type of deficiency we have shown here for sne ib and ic .",
    "the overrepresentation of normal sne ia in low - mass galaxies strengthens the conclusion of @xcite that in order to construct homogeneous sn ia samples for cosmology , it would be best to select them from low - mass galaxies , and not just from star - forming galaxies as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the results of this work differ significantly from those of a10 .",
    "our samples differ significantly as well , as loss is a targeted survey while ptf is untargeted .",
    "we argue here that the loss volume - limited sample , with its known sensitivity and completion caveats , is better suited for studying relative rates than the preliminary ptf sample used by a10 .",
    "still , as the samples from both studies suffer from small - number statistics , we look forward to our results being tested by ongoing and future untargeted surveys .",
