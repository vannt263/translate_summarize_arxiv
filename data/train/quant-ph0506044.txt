    "solid state qubits are considered promising candidates for making processors of quantum computers because they can be scaled up to a large numbers .",
    "the qubits based on josephson junction are these kinds of qubits . but how about their other qualities , in particular , how about their coherence ?",
    "many efforts not only theoretical @xcite but also experimental @xcite have been contributed to search decoherence time as well as decoherence mechanism of the qubit systems .",
    "the theoretical researches are in general based on the spin - boson model @xcite . by now , it is suggested that there are @xmath0 noise and ohmic noise in the environment of the josephson qubits .",
    "it is considered that the former is derived from the background charge fluctuations and the latter from the electromagnetic noise due to voltage fluctuations .",
    "but what is the most primary mechanism of the decoherence , or which is the mainly noise source in the environment of the qubits ? by using the bloch equations @xcite one can derive the relaxation time and dephasing time of the qubits . however , in the derivation of bloch equations an approximation scheme in general the markov approximation should be used .",
    "it has been pointed out recently , the markov approximation is not a suitable approximation scheme in the investigations of the quantum system for quantum computing purposes because it is not usually valid at low temperatures and for short cycle time of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a similar viewpoint on a qubit of double quantum dots is also pointed out , see as @xcite .",
    "privman and his co - worker @xcite investigated the decoherence of qubits with short - time approximation rather than the markov one , and many interesting and novel results are obtained .",
    "however , it is not enough to only investigate the decoherence in a short time because the coherence in a longer time for some qubits ( for example qubits for quantum registers ) is also interesting .",
    "fortunately , it is found out that by using short - time propagators one can construct a path integral @xcite in a longer time .",
    "the well established iterative tensor multiplication ( itm ) algorithm derived from the qusiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) @xcite can be used to solve the evolutions of low - dimension open quantum systems in a moderate long time @xcite . in this method",
    "the temporal non - local interactions is involved and it is non - markovian .",
    "thus , we expect that the non - markovian method can be used to investigate the decoherence of josephson qubits and then to detect the mainly mechanism of the decoherence in the qubits .",
    "there are many kinds of josephson qubit models charge - qubit1,charge - qubit2,flux - qubit1,flux - qubit2,phase - qubit1,phase - qubit2,science2001,youetal , but in this paper we only investigate the josephson charge qubit ( jcq ) .",
    "we shall obtain an accurate decoherence time of the jcq by using the itm algorithm without the markovian approximation .",
    "base on the accurate decoherence time we shall suggest a mainly mechanism of the decoherence in the jcq .",
    "the elementary unit of the quantum computer is a qubit which is in fact a two - level quantum system @xcite .",
    "there are many physical realizations for the system .",
    "however , any single qubit can be represented as a spin-1/2 particle , and its hamiltonian can be written as @xmath1 here @xmath2 are pauli matrixes in a space of states @xmath3 and @xmath4 which form basis states of the hamiltonian",
    ". the quantity @xmath5 has different physical meaning according to the difference of the physical realizations of the qubits .",
    "for example , if the qubit is realized by a spin of some particle the @xmath6 will be an effective magnetic field .",
    "but to the jcq , the components of the `` magnetic field '' are set as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the josephson energy of the josephson junction , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a general qubit can be represented as @xmath11if one modulates the gate voltage and makes @xmath12 the jcq system may be reduced to @xmath13 . in this paper , we take @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 according to ref .",
    "nature1999@xmath18 if one considers the interaction of the qubit and its environment , and takes the environment as a bath , the whole hamiltonian of the system - bath will be @xcite @xmath19where@xmath20 .",
    "\\notag \\\\ & &   \\label{e3}\\end{aligned}\\]]in general , @xmath21 should plus counterterms @xmath22 which can ensure that some important features of the qubit do not depend on the coupling strength . in our problem , the counterterms only contribute a global phase so we can ignore it .",
    "this is the well - known spin - boson model , a appropriately reduced open qubit model . in the following ,",
    "we firstly analyze this model .",
    "on the one hand , for the bath , only the linearly coupling term is chosen in the coordinates @xmath23 , representing the lowest nontrivial term in the taylor series expansion of the potential .",
    "it is accurate enough in the weak coupling case . on the other hand , for the qubit",
    ", only @xmath24 coupling term is included .",
    "the terms of @xmath25 coupling with the bath have not been included in the hamiltonian .",
    "the reason is that @xmath25 have only off - diagonal matrix elements in the @xmath24 representation , i.e. , they only change @xmath26 to @xmath27 and vice versa .    in order to obtain the reduced density matrix of the qubit in qubit - bath system",
    ", one should know the coupling coefficients @xmath28 in eq.(e3 ) .",
    "however , we do not need to know their details because all characteristics of the bath pertaining to the dynamics of the observable system are captured in the spectral density function of noise@xmath29 in the case of truly macroscopic environment the spectral density is for all practical purposes a continuous function of frequency . in the following",
    "we shall see that the spectral density function @xmath30 instead of @xmath28 is directly used in obtaining the elements of the reduced density matrix .",
    "it is related to the power spectrum of the noise as@xmath31here , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath34 is the temperature . throughout the paper",
    "we take @xmath35 mk according to ref .",
    "@xcite . due to very wide of the real and imaginary parts of the response function ( see eq.([e14 ] ) in the following ) in the time range for the @xmath0 bath , we in fact can not investigate the evolutions of the reduced density matrix of qubit in the @xmath0 bath with the itm .",
    "thus , in this paper , we focus on the case that the environment is the ohmic bath .",
    "the spectral density of the ohmic bath can be expressed as @xcite@xmath36where@xmath37 is the cut - off frequency of the bath modes .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is dimensionless strength of the dissipation which is determined by concrete qubit - bath system . for the jcq model , makhlin _ et al . _",
    "proposed a numerical simulation value @xmath39 . in this paper",
    "we suppose @xmath40 if @xmath41 the decoherence time will be shorter than the results obtained in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath42 the decoherence time will be longer than the results in this paper .",
    "in the following , we firstly review the quapi method and then the itm makri scheme . suppose the initial state of the qubit - bath system has the form@xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are initial states of the qubit and bath .",
    "the evolution of its reduced density operator of the open qubit@xmath46is given by@xmath47where the influence functional is@xmath48 .",
    "\\label{e10}\\end{aligned}\\]]the discrete path integral representation of the qubit density matrix contains temporal nonlocal terms @xmath49 which denotes the process being non - markovian . with the quasiadiabatic discretization of the path integral",
    ", the influence functional , eq.([e10 ] ) takes the form@xmath50where @xmath51 and @xmath52 the coefficients @xmath53 can be obtained by substituting the discrete path into the feynman - vernon expression .",
    "their expressions have been shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , the influence functional can be expressed with a product of terms corresponding to different @xmath54 as @xmath55here , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are points of discrete path integral expressions , see ref.@xcite , and@xmath59the length of the memory of the time can be estimated by the following bath response function@xmath60 .",
    "\\label{e14}\\]]it is shown that when the real and imaginary parts behave as the delta function @xmath61 and its derivative @xmath62 the dynamics of the reduced density matrix is markovian .",
    "however , if the real and imaginary parts are broader than the delta function the dynamics is non - markovian .",
    "the broader of the re@xmath63 $ ] and im@xmath64 $ ] are , the longer of the memory time will be .",
    "the broader of the re@xmath64 $ ] and im@xmath65 $ ] are , the more serious the markov approximation will distort the practical dynamics . in fig.1 we plot re@xmath64 $ ] and im@xmath66 $ ] of the ohmic bath.@xmath67from fig .",
    "1 we see that the memory time is about @xmath68 @xmath69 for the ohmic bath . due to nonlocality of the influence functional , it is impossible to calculate the reduced density matrix by eq.([e9 ] ) in matrix multiplication scheme .",
    "however , the short range nonlocality of the influence functional eq.([e10 ] ) implies that the affects of the nonlocality should drop off rapidly as the `` interaction distance ''  increases . in the makri s itm scheme",
    "the interaction can be taken into account at each iteration step .",
    "the reduced density matrix at time @xmath70 ( @xmath71 even ) is given as@xmath72where@xmath73here,@xmath74and@xmath75where@xmath76 in the itm scheme a short - time approximation instead of the markov approximation is used .",
    "the approximation makes a error of short - time propagator in order @xmath77 which is small enough as we set the time step @xmath78 very small .",
    "it is shown that when the time step @xmath78 is not larger than the characteristic time of the qubit system which can be calculated with @xmath79 the calculation is accurate enough @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scheme do not discard the memory of the temporal evolution , which may appropriate to solve the decoherence of qubits .",
    "to measure effects of decoherence one can use the entropy , the first entropy , and many other measures , such as maximal deviation norm etc .",
    ", see @xcite .",
    "however , essentially , the decoherence of a open quantum system is reflected through the decays of the off - diagonal coherent terms of its reduced density matrix .",
    "the decoherence is in general produced due to the interaction of the quantum system with other systems with a large number of degrees of freedom , for example the devices of measurement or environment . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the decoherence time of the jcq via directly describing the evolution of the off - diagonal coherent terms , instead of using any measure of decoherence . in our following investigations ,",
    "we suppose the cut - off frequency of the bath modes is @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "we set the initial state of the qubit @xmath82 which is a pure state and it has the maximum coherent terms , and the initial state of the environment @xmath83tr@xmath84    _ decoherence time obtained from itm scheme : _ at first , we use the itm scheme investigating the decoherence time of the josephson qubits .",
    "the evolutions of the coherent elements of the reduced density matrix of the jcq in the ohmic bath is plotted in fig.2 . here",
    ", we simply choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 s in the itm scheme .",
    "the choice of the time step is feasible as we consider that it should be not shorter than the memory time of the bath , because the latter is about @xmath87 s for the ohmic bath , see fig .",
    "1 . it is also appropriate as we consider that the time step should be not longer than the characteristic time of the qubit , where the latter is about @xmath88 s.@xmath89it is shown that when we choose the parameter of the dimensionless strength of the dissipation @xmath90 the decoherence time of the jcq is about @xmath91 @xmath92s .    _",
    "decoherence time calculated on bloch equations : _ it is well known that the decoherence time can be derived on bloch equations . in this method , the relaxation and dephasing times @xmath93 @xmath94 can be calculated as @xcite@xmath95where @xmath96 is the natural frequency of the josephson qubit . from eq.([e20 ] ) and using the same parameters of the qubit and the bath as above we can obtain that the decoherence time is @xmath97 @xmath92s@xmath18 it is shown that the time obtained from eq.(e20 ) is longer than that from the itm scheme .",
    "we suggest that the difference is derived from the following two reasons .",
    "the first is that the bloch equations are in general derived from the markov approximation which discards the memory of the bath in the derivation of the dynamical evolution .",
    "the second is that the eq.([e20 ] ) is obtained from the second order approximation of perturbation series .",
    "the decoherence of the qubit described with this method is only the `` resonant decoherence '' @xcite .",
    "it is not equals to the actual decoherence accurately except for the `` nonresonant decoherence '' very small .    _",
    "compared with the experimental results : _ in our calculations , we use the parameters similar to ref.@xcite , so we can compare our results to the experimental decoherence time . in @xcite the decoherence time of a single - cooper pair box , namely , the jcq is estimated .",
    "the main decoherence source is thought to be spontaneous photon emission to the electromagnetic environment ( which can just be described by the ohmic bath ) . in @xcite the authors pointed out that the experimental decoherence time of the jcq could exceed @xmath98 @xmath92s@xmath18 it is shown that by use of the ohmic decoherence mechanism we can obtain a theoretical decoherence time of the jcq not only by the itm scheme but also through the bloch equations method . both of the theoretical results are agreement with the experimental one very well !",
    "in this paper we investigated the decoherence time of the jcq in the ohmic bath with the itm scheme based on the quapi and based on the bloch equations .",
    "the results derived from the two kinds of methods are compared with each other .",
    "it is shown that the decoherence time obtained from the bloch equations method is longer than that from the itm scheme .",
    "we suggest that the difference is resulting from the different choices of the approximation scheme because the markov approximation used in the bloch equations method discards the memory of the bath .",
    "it is also because the bloch equations method discards the higher order decoherence , namely , only the `` resonant decoherence '' @xcite is left over .",
    "so the decoherence time obtained from this method is not equals to the actual decoherence time accurately .",
    "what is more important to us is that the experimental decoherence time of the jcq due to spontaneous photon emission is well agreement with the itm decoherence time of the jcq because of the electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "both of the spontaneous photon emission and the electromagnetic fluctuations have the same decoherence mechanism and can be modeled by the ohmic bath .",
    "these can lead to a conclusion that the ohmic bath decoherence is a central mechanism in the jcq and the decoherence time of the jcq is about @xmath98 @xmath92s when the temperature is about @xmath99 mk and the josephson energy is about @xmath100 @xmath92ev .",
    "the decoherence time is decided by the decoherence mechanism and affected by the experimental temperature .",
    "if the experimental temperature increase the dimensionless strength of the dissipation @xmath38 will also increase and the decoherence time will be shorter , and vice versa .",
