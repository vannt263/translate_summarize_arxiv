    "we emphasize that the proposed model is pessimistic in the sense that it provides a lower bound on the overall network performance and focuses on the regime with large sbs density . for spectrum allocation",
    ", we define the spectrum access factor as a measure of spectrum accessed by the sbss .",
    "we also show the interplay of caching and spectrum sharing in such heterogeneous networks , drawing insights on the tradeoff between cache size and spectrum access factor , for different content popularity models .",
