    "spinelectronics is becoming an increasingly important technology for the realization of nonvolatile , fast , low - power computer memory and is already well - established in hard disk drive read heads and magnetic sensors.@xcite the key component in spinelectronic devices , a magnetoresistive element using either the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) or tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) , is comprised of two magnetic films : a free sense - layer and a fixed reference layer .",
    "the ferromagnetic free layer is free to follow external magnetic fields or can be switched by a current via the spin transfer torque .",
    "the reference layer has to be stable against external fields to allow for different magnetic alignments of the two layers , which give rise to the magnetoresistance .",
    "usually the reference layer is made by pinning a thin ferromagnetic film ( fm ) to an antiferromagnetic film ( afm ) .",
    "the exchange bias@xcite ( eb ) associated with this pinning shifts the magnetic hysteresis of the reference layer to fields that are not encountered during normal device operation .",
    "the antiferromagnet has to meet a number of criteria to be suitable for integration into such stacks : ( 1 ) temperature stability : the temperature at which the exchange bias of the afm / fm stack vanishes ( the so - called blocking temperature ) has to be significantly larger than the device operation temperature .",
    "( 2 ) exchange bias and coercive fields : the exchange bias field has to be significantly larger than the coercive field to allow for a clear separation of the parallel and antiparallel magnetic states of the gmr or tmr stack . ( 3 ) ease of manufacturing : processing with industry - standard magnetron sputtering onto si wafers is desired , hence polycrystalline systems have to meet the above criteria .",
    "high annealing temperatures above 300@xmath4c and deposition at elevated temperature should also be avoided for integration with semiconductor technology . for lithographic processing ,",
    "the material needs to be sufficiently stable against oxidation .",
    "( 4 ) environmental safety and price : for large - scale application the price of the material will play a crucial role . also , use of unsafe or otherwise critical materials should be avoided .",
    "( 5 ) for current - in - plane gmr devices , the afm has to be highly resistive , in order not to short - cut the active gmr stack .    the criteria 1 to 3 are mostly met by the commonly used antiferromagnets ptmn and irmn,@xcite although ptmn requires high temperature annealing to form the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , criterion 4 is obviously violated : pt and ir are rare , expensive , and mining for them causes considerable environmental pollution.@xcite thus , alternatives to these noble - metal based systems are needed .",
    "other antiferromagnets , such as femn and nimn have poor corrosion resistance or the ratio of exchange bias and coercive fields is not ideal for many applications.@xcite    in the present article we report on a new exchange bias system that is based on the antiferromagnet mnn .",
    "it crystallizes in the @xmath5-phase of the mn - n phase diagram,@xcite which has the tetragonal face - centered variant of the nacl structure with @xmath6 and @xmath7 at room temperature ( rt ) , where the precise numbers depend on the n content in the material .",
    "with increasing nitrogen content , larger lattice constants are observed.@xcite    the nel temperature of mnn is about 660k;@xcite the magnetic transition is accompanied by a tetragonal - to - cubic structural transformation caused by magnetostriction.@xcite the magnetic order of the material was investigated with neutron powder diffraction@xcite and by first principles calculations.@xcite it was found to be collinear of afm - i type , i.e. with the magnetic moments coupled parallel within the @xmath8-planes and alternating along the @xmath8-direction .",
    "the spin orientation is under debate ; leineweber _ et al .",
    "_ found it to be along the @xmath8-direction just below the nel temperature , while it would tilt slightly away from the @xmath8-axis at lower temperature.@xcite instead , suzuki _",
    "_ found the spin direction to be in the @xmath8-planes.@xcite an important difference between these experiments lies in the preparation procedures , that led to a slightly nitrogen - poor @xmath5-mnn in the first case , while the @xmath5-mnn was saturated in the second case , which is also reflected by the larger lattice constants in the latter case .",
    "we therefore propose that the data measured by suzuki _",
    "_ reflect the intrinsic properties of the stoichiometric @xmath5-mnn phase . in both cases ,",
    "the mn magnetic moments were found to be @xmath9 at room temperature .",
    "to investigate the suitability of mnn as an antiferromagnet for exchange bias applications , we prepared film stacks of ta 10 nm / mnn @xmath10 / co@xmath11fe@xmath12 @xmath13 / ta 0.5 nm / ta@xmath14o@xmath15 2 nm on thermally oxidized si wafers by ( reactive ) dc magnetron sputtering at room temperature .",
    "the sputtering system used here was a 2-inch co - sputtering system with a target - to - substrate distance of 90 mm and an unbalanced magnetron configuration .",
    "the base pressure of the system was around @xmath16 mbar prior to the deposition runs .",
    "the mnn films were sputtered from an elemental mn target in a mixed ar and n@xmath14 atmosphere with various working pressures and partial pressure ratios .",
    "optimization of the deposition parameters with respect to the exchange bias yielded a 50:50 n@xmath14:ar mixture at @xmath17 mbar as the best deposition condition .",

    "[ fig : xrd_all](a ) a typical x - ray diffraction spectrum of the ta / mnn / cofe stacks is shown .",
    "all peaks are identified as belonging to the substrate , to the ta seed layer , or to the mnn film .",
    "the ta layer has ( 011 ) orientation with very small grains with grain size @xmath21 . the lattice constant of mnn before annealing is larger than @xmath22 , which is larger than the bulk values reported in the literature .",
    "no other phases are observed , and the lattice constant is too large to identify the structure as the cubic @xmath23-mn@xmath24n or the tetragonal @xmath25-mn@xmath26n@xmath14 phase.@xcite the mass density obtained from x - ray reflectivity is @xmath27 ( without annealing ) , which is slightly larger than the expected mass density of @xmath28 assuming a stoichiometric @xmath5-mnn with the lattice constants given by suzuki _ _ et al.__@xcite this indicates that the in - plane lattice constants are contracted with respect to the literature values . by in - plane diffraction measurements",
    "it was found that the lattice constant in the film plane is @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the out - of - plane lattice constant is _ larger _ than the in - plane constant , at odds with the usual @xmath5-phase with @xmath30 . here , we find @xmath31 .",
    "all peaks observed with in - plane diffraction are compatible with an fct phase with @xmath31 . in the following",
    ", we shall call this phase @xmath32-mnn , as it is structurally equivalent to the @xmath5-phase , however it shows a strong tetragonal distortion along the film growth direction .",
    "the observed mass density matches the expected mass density of stoichiometric @xmath32-mnn perfectly .",
    "we present results from a film thickness series in figure [ fig : xrd_all](b)-(e ) , where films in their as - deposited state and films after annealing at 325@xmath4c are compared .",
    "the perpendicular crystallite size and microstrain contributions to the peak widths were extracted from the ( 002 ) and ( 004 ) reflections with the williamson - hall equation:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the size - strain contribution to the peak width after removing the instrumental broadening , @xmath35 is the scherrer constant which we take as @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the crystallite size along the film growth direction , and @xmath23 describes the microstrain in terms of a relative lattice constant variation . as the microstrain is fairly large in our films , a straightforward evaluation of the peak widths with scherrer s formula leads to an erroneous saturation of the perpendicular grain size at 12 nm .",
    "the microstrain can be evaluated with small error bar with this method , however the crystallite size is very sensitive to small errors in the peak width determination , which results in large relative errors .",
    "the integral breadths were used to determine the peak widths @xmath34 and the instrumental broadening was determined with a strain - free si pressed powder pellet .",
    "we observe that the lattice constant is independent of the mnn film thickness in the as - deposited state , but after annealing the lattice constant is much smaller for thin films , whereas it shrinks only slightly for thicker films . the rocking curve width is reduced with increasing film thickness and saturates at about @xmath38 for @xmath39 . for all film thicknesses the rocking curve width is reduced by about @xmath40 through annealing at @xmath2c for 15min , which indicates lateral grain growth and grain boundary crystallization .",
    "the williamson - hall analysis shows that the perpendicular grain size is directly proportional to the film thickness up to @xmath41 .",
    "annealing induces further grain growth or defect healing and the perpendicular grain size matches the film thickness up to @xmath42 . for thick films ,",
    "the annealing reduces the microstrain of the films , whereas it is increased for thin films up to @xmath43 . in both cases",
    "it is still rather large , which indicates a large number of defects in the films . in conclusion",
    ", we obtained @xmath32-mnn films with a pronounced @xmath44-fiber texture .    to further investigate the large change in the lattice constant of thin mnn films upon annealing",
    ", we made an annealing series with two mnn film thicknesses , the results of which are shown in figure [ fig : xrd_all](f ) . for a 32 nm thick film , the lattice constant shrinks slightly with increasing annealing temperature , where the shrinking sets in at about @xmath45c .",
    "the 6 nm thick film shows instead a phase transition to a structure with much smaller lattice constant at @xmath46c , which we assume to be the @xmath23-mn@xmath24n phase .",
    "we suppose that this phase transition arises from n diffusion into the ta seed layer , which would form a tan@xmath47 layer at the interface and passivate at some point .",
    "thicker mnn films do not show this phase transition because their n reservoir is much larger , so that not enough n can diffuse out of the film to form the @xmath23-mn@xmath24n .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig : xrd_all](f ) shows that the lattice constant shrinks with reduced nitrogen flow in the sputtering gas .",
    "this arises from the stuffing of the fct mn lattice with n atoms : with decreasing nitrogen content the lattice is not sufficiently filled and the lattice constant will shrink .",

    "the loop shows high exchange bias and a reasonably low coercive field with a squareness of @xmath55 .",
    "the ferromagnet is almost saturated at zero external field . in the following",
    "we discuss the variation of various stack parameters to identify the optimum deposition and post - annealing conditions for the mnn / cofe stacks to maximize the exchange bias field and simultaneously minimize the coercive field of the cofe .",

    "a maximum of @xmath49 was observed at @xmath56 nm . for @xmath57 nm and @xmath58 nm no exchange bias was found .",
    "between @xmath57 nm and @xmath59 nm , the coercive field rises sharply which can be traced back to the phase transition to mn@xmath24n at low mnn film thickness discussed earlier . at @xmath59",
    "nm the x - ray diffraction indicates that the mnn is preserved upon annealing , so we assume the observed mnn film thickness dependence of the coercive and exchange bias fields to reflect the intrinsic properties of the mnn / cofe bilayer at and above @xmath59 nm .",
    "notably , the maximum of the exchange bias is found for significantly larger afm thickness as compared to irmn ( 7 nm ) or ptmn ( 20nm).@xcite    the cofe thickness variation , shown in fig . [ fig : moke_loops_thicknesses](c ) , has the usual @xmath60 dependence for cofe thickness above @xmath61 nm . at lower thickness",

    "the coercive field does not significantly change with the deposition pressure , however the exchange bias shows a strong , nearly linear decrease with the deposition pressure between @xmath78 and @xmath79 mbar .",
    "this can be traced back to a deterioration of the mnn film growth as shown in figure [ fig : pressure_moke_xrd](b)-(d ) .",
    "the film roughness increases strongly , and also the rocking curve width and the microstrain increase to some extent at high deposition pressure .",

    "the exchange bias is lost and the coercive field enlarged at the same time .",
    "this may be related to nitrogen diffusion and destruction of the stack or to a structural or magnetic transition due to the loss of nitrogen .",
    "in favor of the second hypothesis speaks the fact that the annealing temperature at which exchange bias is lost increases with increasing nitrogen content in the films .     and @xmath50 for different nitrogen partial pressure ratios during the reactive sputtering of mnn .",
    "the total pressure was held at @xmath82 mbar .",
    "film thicknesses were @xmath83 nm and @xmath53nm.,width=325 ]    a particularly interesting feature of the annealing temperature dependence is the dip around @xmath45c , where the exchange bias almost vanishes .",
    "it is present for all nitrogen partial pressures .",
    "we assume that this dip is related to an irreversible structural or magnetic transition in the mnn or at the mnn / cofe interface . because of this complex behavior that is also related to crystal structure changes as discussed earlier , it is impossible to determine the blocking temperature of the stack from these annealing experiments .",
    "we investigate the blocking temperature distribution in the next section in detail .",
    "another remarkable feature of the annealing temperature dependence is the peak of the exchange bias after annealing of the 55%-n@xmath14 sample at @xmath84c .",
    "the increase of the exchange bias already sets in at @xmath85c , which is just above the nel temperature of the mnn . as this",
    "is associated with a structural transition into the cubic phase , we suggest that after cooling through the transition in the external field , the mnn will recrystallize in a state that has enhanced coupling to the cofe film and thereby generate a higher exchange bias",
    ". additional experimental work will be necessary to clarify this .",
    "to gain a deeper understanding of the film thickness dependence of the exchange bias , we performed reversed field cooling experiments @xcite with different mnn thicknesses to obtain the blocking temperature distributions as a function of the mnn film thickness . samples with @xmath86 nm and @xmath83 nm were initially field cooled at 6.5koe from @xmath2c , their hysteresis loops were measured , and then successively field cooled in a reversed field of 6.5koe from @xmath87c with the hysteresis loops measured between successive field cooling steps .    , ( b ) : unblocked ratio , and ( c ) : derivative of the unblocked ratio versus reversal temperature .",
    "initial and reversal fields were 6.5koe.,width=325 ]    in figure [ fig : blocking_temperatures ] we present the results of this procedure . for easier comparison",
    ", we show the exchange bias normalized to the room temperature value in figure [ fig : blocking_temperatures](a ) .",
    "it is obvious that for thin mnn the blocking temperatures are much smaller than for larger mnn thickness . at @xmath53",
    "nm the blocking temperature distribution is essentially converged .",
    "the zero of this curve marks the median blocking temperature @xmath88 of those antiferromagnetic grains that are still blocked at room temperature .",
    "clearly , this value varies strongly with the mnn film thickness and reaches a maximum of @xmath89c for large mnn thickness .",
    "the median blocking temperature is slightly higher compared to femn ( @xmath90c ) , but lower compared to irmn ( @xmath91c ) , ptmn ( @xmath92c ) , or nimn ( @xmath93c).@xcite    from the @xmath94 dependence we obtain the area fraction of unblocked grains , the so - called unblocked ratio @xmath95 as @xmath96,\\ ] ] which represents the cumulative distribution function of the blocking temperature ( see figure [ fig : blocking_temperatures](b ) ) .",
    "this quantity is only meaningful for the two films with large mnn thickness , because it refers to the ratio of grains that are unblocked at @xmath97 with respect to the number of grains that are still blocked at room temperature .",
    "the distributions however suggest that this number is already small for @xmath98 nm and that the average blocking temperature is already below room temperature in these cases .",
    "the blocking temperature distribution is obtained by taking the derivative @xmath99 , which is shown in figure [ fig : blocking_temperatures](c ) .",
    "the blocking temperature distribution shows two maxima , one at around 125@xmath4c and another one around the initial set temperature of 325@xmath4c or more .",
    "this bimodal distribution is rather unusual for exchange bias systems@xcite and its origin is the subject of further studies we conduct .",
    "it may indicate the existence of at least two different populations of afm / fm coupled grains with two different grain size distributions or different antiferromagnetic configurations .",

    ", we have made an oxidation study with x - ray reflectometry on a ta / mnn film without any capping layer .",

    "then samples were heated in air ( relative humidity @xmath100 at @xmath101c ) up to @xmath45c for 1h .",
    "the results of this annealing experiment are shown in figure [ fig : oxidation_and_gmr](a ) .",
    "clearly , temperatures above 100@xmath4c are necessary to promote the oxidation of the film .",

    "so , at room temperature the diffusion coefficient is merely @xmath107 .",
    "this appears surprising at a first glance , since it is well known that mn compounds oxidize easily in many cases . to understand the good oxidation stability of mnn we have to consider that mnn is a densely packed structure with the small n atoms residing in the ( nearly ) octahedral interstices of the fct mn lattice , giving rise to a high density of the material .",
    "evaluating the pilling - bedworth ratio @xmath108 , we find that it is close to 1 , which means that a stable and only weakly strained , self - passivating oxide layer is formed on the surface of mnn that protects the bulk material from oxidation.@xcite in summary , we expect mnn to be well suitable for lithographic processing .    finally , as a proof - of - principle for integration of mnn into spintronic devices , we made current - in - plane gmr spin - valve stacks with ta 10 / mnn 30 / cofe @xmath13 / cu @xmath109 / cofe @xmath13 / ta 0.5 / ta@xmath14o@xmath15 1.0 .",
    "it is well known that cu diffuses strongly at temperatures above @xmath46c , which are required to establish a high exchange bias with mnn .",
    "nevertheless , by varying @xmath13 and @xmath109 we obtained gmr stacks that showed exchange bias up to 850oe , clear separation of the parallel and antiparallel magnetic states or a gmr amplitude up to 6.3% , see figure [ fig : oxidation_and_gmr](b ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that mnn can be used as an exchange biasing material in spintronic devices .",
    "we have prepared ta / mnn / cofe exchange bias stacks by reactive magnetron sputtering and optimized the deposition conditions carefully . from our structural analysis we infer that a novel phase , @xmath32-mnn with @xmath31 , was grown with @xmath44-fiber texture .",
    "our findings demonstrate that mnn is a useful antiferromagnet for exchange biasing in spinelectronic devices .",
    "the mnn / cofe system has large exchange bias ( up to 1800oe ) at room temperature , reasonably large blocking temperature ( @xmath89c ) and is cheap in terms of materials and processing cost .",

    "<S> these properties come along with a surprisingly simple manufacturing process for the mnn films . </S>"
