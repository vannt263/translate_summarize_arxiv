    "subwavelength sized particles that feature electromagnetic resonances are ideal tools to concentrate light at the nanometer scale .",
    "they play an important role in a wide range applications@xcite including receiving elements in optical antennas,@xcite solar panel transducers@xcite and sensing@xcite . in this context",
    ", the design of nanoparticles that feature the ability to optimally convert light energy in at least one incident field mode into another form like photoluminescence or heat is of crucial importance.@xcite such particles will be defined in this study as ideal absorption ( ia ) particles .",
    "ideal absorption has also been called coherent perfect absorption@xcite since it results in a mode of the _ total field _ taking the form of a purely incoming being _",
    "completely _ absorbed by the particle . in this work ,",
    "we prefer to avoid this terminology since absorption is only perfect  for an ideal @xmath0 illumination specifically adapted to the corresponding ia mode.@xcite    in this work , ideal absorption is first introduced by demonstrating that it corresponds to a fundamental upper bound in an absorption cross section channel , ( @xmath1 for a _ dipole _ resonator ) . a ` point - like ' model",
    "is then shown to provide an analytical formula for predicting an electric dipole ia , but since this model is inaccurate for all but the smallest particles , significantly improved approximate formulas are derived .",
    "we proceed to show that the ensemble of ia solutions can be determined using the so called weierstrass factorization of the analytical scattering response of spherical particles.@xcite other considerations , like multi - mode absorption and ia bandwidth are discussed using illustrative calculations .",
    "we demonstrate that our formulas predict ia in homogeneous spheres with realizable materials at specific frequencies , and sizes .",
    "this work finishes with a derivation of a simple procedure for designing core - shell particles to exhibit ia at essentially any frequency in the visible and near visible frequency range .",
    "scattering in three dimensional electromagnetic problems can conveniently be expressed in terms of incoming and outgoing spherical vector partial waves ( vpws).@xcite the vpws are solutions of homogeneous media maxwell equations of either electric source type ( @xmath2 : @xmath3 ) or magnetic source type ( @xmath4 : @xmath5 ) , with the @xmath6 superscripts indicating that the functions satisfy outgoing ( incoming ) boundary conditions respectively .",
    "the subscript , @xmath7 , denotes the total angular momentum number , and @xmath8 , the angular momentum projection number.@xcite the spatial dependence of the vpws is scaled by the in - medium wavenumber , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the refraction index of the homogeneous background material , and @xmath11 , the in - medium wavelength .",
    "theoretical treatments of electromagnetic scattering from a homogeneous spherically symmetric particle go under the names of lorenz - mie - debye theory , but the physical content is best viewed in the formalism of s or t matrices , originally developed for quantum mechanical scattering theory.@xcite the s - matrix seems best adapted to the discussion of ia , and is privileged from here on .    the _ total field _ in a homogeneous region surrounding a particle can always be developed on the basis set of the incoming and outgoing vpws , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively denoting the the electric and magnetic mode vpws field coefficients . since s - matrix of a spherically symmetric system",
    "is automatically diagonal in the vpw basis , its elements express the linear relationship between the outgoing and incoming field coefficients of the total field for both electric and magnetic source fields respectively , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "algebraic manipulations involving the t - matrix@xcite , and the definition of the s - matrix@xcite , @xmath16 , provide convenient expressions for the s - matrix coefficients :    @xmath17    [ mies ]    where , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are respectively the permittivity and permeability contrasts between the sphere and the host medium , and @xmath20 is the wavenumber inside the sphere . the @xmath21 and @xmath22 functions respectively denote the outgoing and incoming spherical hankel functions .",
    "the expressions in eq.(1 ) also employ the functions : @xmath23^{\\prime } } { h_{n}^{\\left(\\pm\\right ) } ( x ) } \\ , \\qquad \\varphi_{n } ( x )   \\equiv   \\frac{\\left[xj_{n}(x)\\right]^{\\prime}}{j_{n}(x ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the @xmath25 order spherical bessel functions .",
    "flux conservation imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of the @xmath26 matrix elements , @xmath27 , where the upper limit , @xmath28 is satisfied by any lossless scatterer since this condition results directly in @xmath29.@xcite the s - matrix of a lossless scatterer is characterized by zeros ( absorbing modes ) in the upper - half complex frequency plane , and poles ( emitting modes ) in the lower - half plane frequency plane.@xcite adding absorption to the particle causes the absorbing modes to descend towards ( and finally into ) the lower complex plane with ia occurring at those values of @xmath30 for which a zero of the s - matrix lies on the real frequency axis , _ i.e. _ there exists an @xmath7 such that :    @xmath31    [ abscond ]    when @xmath32 ( these conditions being found by inspection of eq.([se ] ) and eq.([sh ] ) .",
    "scattering and absorption cross sections of a spherically symmetric scatterer are the sum of the contributions from all multi - pole orders , @xmath7 : @xmath33 the multi - pole contributions to the extinction , scattering , and absorption cross sections@xcite can be respectively expressed in terms of the s - matrix as :    @xmath34    [ crossect ]    where the @xmath35 factors arise from the azimuthal mode degeneracy of the orbital modes .",
    "one finds that an ia mode contributes equally to the absorption and scattering cross sections by inserting the ia criteria , @xmath36 into eq.([abssect ] ) and eq.([scatsect ] ) ( in either the @xmath37 or @xmath38 channels ) , with values of : @xmath39 which is an upper bound for the absorption cross section of a mode , but a factor four times less than the @xmath40 , _ _ unitary limit__@xcite of the scattering or extinction cross sections , obtainable from eq.([scatsect ] ) and eq.([extsect ] ) .",
    "the equality of scattering and absorption cross sections in an ia channel follows from the fact that ia requires the field scattered by the particle to have perfectly destructive interference with the outgoing wave components of the local excitation field ( leaving the @xmath25 order modes of the total field to be purely incoming ) .",
    "we also remark the many properties of ia in particles , like eq.([crosslim ] ) , find analogues in the ideal absorption of 1d systems , where for example the maximum absorption coefficient , @xmath41 , of a plane wave illuminating a single side of a symmetric thin film occurs when @xmath42.@xcite    since the @xmath43 is a complex function of a real variable , and @xmath44 is real for real valued @xmath45 , the ia solutions of eq.([eia ] ) or eq.([hia ] ) can occur only for complex values of @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , eqs.(3 ) are transcendental equations , and each has an infinite number of solutions . for the sake of clarity , further discussion in this work",
    "will be limited to the @xmath46 ( _ i.e. _ dipole ) mode solutions of eq.(3 ) .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the solutions of eq.([eia ] ) with the lowest values of @xmath47 are plotted as the blue(solid ) line in fig.([fig : iaapprox ] ) for particle diameters ranging from zero up to a little more than a wavelength .",
    "these results were computed by taking advantage of the newly developed weierstrass factorization for resonant photonic structures.@xcite one readily remarks that this solution tends to the well - known quasi - static dipolar plasmon resonance at @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",

    ", one can directly connect the isotropic polarizability in terms of the electric dipole s - matrix element , @xmath56 , via the relation:@xcite @xmath57 leading to an ia polarizability of @xmath58 .",
    "an advantage of the point - like model is that one can algebraically solve eq.([oldpoint ] ) for the value of @xmath59 producing an ia polarizability as a function of the size parameter , @xmath60 : @xmath61 the real and imaginary parts of this expression for @xmath30 are plotted in fig.([fig : iaapprox]a ) and fig.([fig : iaapprox]b ) ( green curves ) , and although @xmath30 tends towards the numerically obtained result ( blue curve ) in the @xmath49 limit , it differs significantly from the exact result for larger particle sizes .    one can determine much more reliable predictions of the ia conditions by analyzing the pole structure of the special functions .",

    "we remark that the magnetic dipole contributions ( green curve ) are insignificant at such sizes . for somewhat larger sub-@xmath11 particles , like the @xmath83 , the electric dipole ia solution in fig.([fig : sigabs]b ) , one remarks that the electric dipole ia is accompanied by non - negligible absorption in higher order modes including the magnetic dipole contribution ( in green ) .",
    "this behavior is accentuated for @xmath85 with magnetic dipole contributions coming close to the ia condition in both the @xmath91 and @xmath93 designs .",
    "we remark however that even when ia occurs for both electric and magnetic dipole modes in the same particle , they can not both be satisfied at the same frequency ( for a homogeneous particle at least ) .",

    "notably , the electric quadrupole , magnetic dipole and higher order corrections are essentially negligible near the silver ia resonance , while non - electric dipole orders contribute significantly to absorption ( but not scattering ) at wavelengths below the ia resonance in gold .",
    "one should also remark that although the dipole contributions to the absorption cross sections are limited by their theoretical upper bound of @xmath111 , the electric dipole scattering cross section of gold rises to values above @xmath112 , at frequencies below the ia resonance , but this is allowed by the general theoretical considerations of eq.([crossect ] ) where one sees that the scattering cross section of a dipole mode is only required by unitarity to satisfy @xmath113 .",
    "nevertheless , one can see in both fig.([fig : silver_gold]b ) and fig.([fig : silver_gold]d ) that @xmath114 at the ia resonance as required by the general theoretical restraint of eq.([crosslim ] ) .",
    "although we saw that changing the background material index allows some control over ia frequency with homogeneous inclusions , applications are likely to want to design ia to occur at particular frequencies with a set of available materials .",
    "this will require additional adjustable geometric parameters and concentric coatings is one of the simplest ways to achieve this .    if we consider inclusions consisting of a core and a single concentric coating , one has two adjustable parameters , the radius of the outer shell @xmath115 , and its concentric spherical core , @xmath116 ( cf .",
    "fig.([fig : coated_sch ] ) .",
    "it proves convenient to fix these two dimensioned parameters , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , in terms of the dimensionless size parameter , @xmath50 , and core material filling factor @xmath117 . unlike the homogeneous sphere studied in the previous section",
    ", the analytic properties of the @xmath26 matrix can not be directly exploited to determine the parameters producing ia solutions , since no ia solutions are guaranteed to exist when varying the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath118 of a coated sphere with fixed permittivities .",

    "the filling fraction of the core material is defined as @xmath117 . ]",
    "given the complexity of the analytic coated sphere solutions , the possible non - existence of solutions at finite frequency , and finally the fact that there are multiple adjustable parameters , it is advantageous to develop compact approximate formulas that allow one to rapidly determine which parameters and materials can provide viable designs for coated sphere ia .",
    "we derive now an approximation which allows the design of core - shell electric dipole ia scattterers by taking advantage of the fact that one is generally interested in designing sub - wavelength ia particles .",
    "we saw that eq.([eiamod ] ) provides an accurate approximation for the required ia permittivity contrast , @xmath30 , over the entire range of the size parameter @xmath122 .",
    "the maxwell - garnett effective medium approach is derived as the effective permittivity of a concentric sub - wavelength core - shell particle whose volume fraction matches that of the bulk material .",
    "the effective permittivity , @xmath123 , of a core - shell system can thus be written as a function of filling fraction , @xmath118:@xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the shell and core relative permittivities respectively .",
    "this equation can then be algebraically inverted to yields filling fraction as a function of @xmath123 _ i.e. _ : @xmath127    one can then solve for core - shell ia by replacing the `` effective '' index in eq.([fcond ] ) by the @xmath128 of eq.([eiamod ] ) that specifies the permittivity required for the ia condition .",
    "since @xmath123 and at least one of the materials is complex valued , the filling fraction , @xmath118 , found by eq.([fcond ] ) is generally complex , but one can vary the size parameter , @xmath129 to obtain a @xmath130 solution graphically .",
