    "consider a multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) wireless sensor network deployed for monitoring or surveillance purpose .",
    "depending on the individual capacity , each sensor may be equipped with a different number of antennae and provisioned with a different power constraint .",
    "when an event @xmath0 occurs , it is highly likely that multiple sensors may have sensed it , but each observation will likely be distorted ( with independent distortion resulting from , for example , thermal noise and circuitry noise ) .",
    "a central question lying in this line of wsn scenarios is how the sensors should communicate with the fusion center ( fc ) in reliable and efficient manner .    from the information theory perspective",
    ", this type of problems may be regarded as a form of the so - called ceo ( chief executive officer ) problem @xcite , where a group of agents feed individually biased observations to a ceo , who tries to recover the original source as much as possible . from the communication perspective , what s of particular interest is the joint transceiver design between the multiple sensors and the fusion center to achieve the maximum communication efficiency .    a good number of studies exist in the literature on this and similar system models .",
    "most of them target minimizing the mean square error ( mse , which measures the amount of signal distortion ) , an important criterion widely adopted in signal estimation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and much fewer considered mutual information ( mi , which measures the amount of uncertainty of the source released at the receiver ) .",
    "mutual information not only is important in its own right , but also presents useful relevance to mse and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop new and efficient ways to design mimo transceivers ( beamformers ) that enable maximal end - to - end mutual information in a noisy - observation multi - sensor wireless network . since beamformer design problems",
    "are usually nonconvex and hence difficult , and since a large set of variables and constraints are typically involved , it has become a standard approach to leverage the block coordinate descent / ascent ( bcd / bca ) tool to break down the original problem into a set of smaller subproblems ( blocks ) involving fewer variables each .",
    "nonetheless , each subproblem can still be difficult to handle , and the specific method to address them can make a huge difference in performance and especially in complexity ( and speed ) .",
    "further , a small difference in the system model ( e.g. separate power constraints vs a total power constraint ) can sometimes lead to a rather different optimization problem , causing a previous method to become rather inefficient or totally inapplicable .",
    "several early beamformer papers for mimo wsn have focused on compression or signal space reduction ( i.e. precoders with rate @xmath1 ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies consider more general transceiver design where the beamformer can have an arbitrary ( positive ) rate , and have investigated a variety of system setups .",
    "specifically , a very general system model for the wsn noisy - sensor observation problem was introduced in @xcite , whose parameters include channel fading and additive noise , separate power constraints , and either orthogonal or coherent multiple access channels ( mac ) . due to the difficulty in attacking the general model , @xcite instead provided solutions to specific ( but nonetheless very interesting ) cases , including the case when the source is a scalar , when the sensor - fc channels are noiseless , and when the sensor - fc channels are non - interferenced ( i.e. sensor - fc channel fading matrices are diagonal matrices ) . following this general model , a highly noteworthy work is @xcite , which developed a very useful bcd - based method targeting mmse beamformers for coherent mac .",
    "the method developed in @xcite is relatively general and capable of obtaining numerical beamformers for most of the cases  except when a second - order coefficient matrix for the quadratic optimization problem becomes singular ( in which case the method with zero lagrangian multiplier will fail ) .",
    "a more recent paper @xcite developed a different and even more general iterative bcd - based beamformer design method targeting mmse for the same system model .",
    "in addition to solving all the cases@xcite also demonstrated the convergence of any essentially - cyclic block - updating rule ( including the specific block - updating rule used in @xcite ) .",
    "these previous excellent studies all take mse as the optimization objective . since mutual information presents an essential indicator for communication efficiency , it is also highly interesting to see how beamformers can be designed to achieve maximal mi .",
    "the topic is somewhat more involved than the target mse , and also appears less researched .",
    "the only paper we could find in the wsn literature targeting maximal mi beamformer design is a recent paper @xcite , which considered an orthogonal sensor - fc channel ( a model drastically different from the coherent mac model considered here ) .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a coherent mimo amplify - forward ( af ) model developed in the recent relay literature @xcite .",
    "the model thereof consists of several source - destination pairs communicating via the help of a group of common relays performing amplify - and - forward ( af ) .",
    "the source , relay and destination nodes in the relay system are like the sources / events , sensors and fusion centers in our sensing system ; the difference is that in the sensing system , the first hop is passive transmission with no precoder performed at the transmitter . since the relay model subsumes our sensing model ( by setting the number of source - destine pairs to one ) , several interesting ideas developed thereof can be relevant .",
    "however , as will be shown later ( in subsection [ subsec : contribution ] , comment [ cmt:3_bca ] ) , comment [ cmt : convergence ] , table [ tab : runningtime1 ] , figure [ fig : comparisontstinr ] ) , our proposed methods are either more efficient or more effective than all of these existing approaches .",
    "the key contribution of this paper is the development of two new beamforming design methods targeting maximal mi for the noisy - observation multi - sensor system , and the proof of strong convergence results . unlike many previous approaches that are limited to only certain models @xcite ( where signal dimension has specific constraints , or channel has no fading or noise ) , the methods developed here are general , and applicable to beamformers with any dimensions and channels with noise and fading .",
    "for the rather general sensing model considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : sysmodel ] , by leveraging the tool of weighted mmse ( wmmse)@xcite @xcite , we decompose the original problem into three subproblems that optimize the weight matrix , the postcoder and the set of precoders , respectively .",
    "we present analytical solutions for the first two subproblems , and for the third one where closed - form analysis is intractable , we develop two new and efficient methods to solve them .",
    "\\(i ) the first method is a batch - mode approach that designs all the precoders at once . specifically , we succeeded in transforming the subproblem into a rather general second - order cone programming ( socp ) formulation , which then lends itself to relatively efficient numerical solvers .",
    "not many batch - mode approaches have been previously attempted , and the solutions in the literature are either applicable to only simpler special channel cases @xcite or require additional assumptions @xcite .",
    "the new batch - mode approach has overcome the previous limitations by providing solution that has a broader usability and runs faster .",
    "it also allows us to perform rigorous convergence analysis which has been attempted but nevertheless missing in the previous studies ( i.e. only conjectures / discussions but not proofs were presented in the literature , e.g. @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our convergence analysis confirms that the limit points of our solution satisfy the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) condition of the original mi maximization problem .",
    "\\(ii ) the second method is a cyclic multi - block approach that further decomposes the task of optimizing the beamformers at all the sensors into multiple subproblems .",
    "the subproblems are shown to be convex trust - region subproblems .",
    "the previous approaches inevitably rely on numerical solvers , such as semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) @xcite , or the conventional numerical solution to general trust - region surbproblem @xcite , to solve these subproblems , and some of them are only applicable to strictly convex subproblems @xcite . exploiting the convexity ,",
    "we successfully enhance the standard solution to the trust - region subproblem for the convex case by developing near closed - form solutions ( possibly up to a simple one - dimension bisection search ) .",
    "compared to the conventional numerical methods to solve trust - region subproblems in the literature , our new analytical result has a significantly lower complexity , and provides a better insight into the solution .",
    "it clearly delineates the cases for unique optimal solutions and multiple optimal solutions , and the in the latter case , can provide the solution with the least energy consumption ( with minimum @xmath2-norm ) . for scalar sources ,",
    "a completely closed - form solution is also derived , which eliminates the eigonvalue decomposition or bisection search .",
    "these results are not known previously in the literature and greatly improves the efficiency of beamformer design .",

    "as illustrated in fig.[fig : sysmodel ] , the mimo wireless sensing system we consider include @xmath31 sensors , each equipped with @xmath32 antennae ( @xmath33 ) , and a fusion center equipped with @xmath34 antennae . following the convention , we assume the source signal @xmath0 to be a complex gaussian vector of dimension @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the positive definite covariance matrix . due to the interference from the surroundings and/or the thermal noise from the sensing device ,",
    "the observations made at each sensor tend to be individually contaminated .",
    "we model the sensing distortion using the complex gaussian distribution : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the covariance matrix and @xmath40 s are mutually uncorrelated for @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the @xmath19-th sensor observes @xmath41 .",
    "each sensor applies a linear beamformer @xmath42 to its observation before putting it through the coherence mac to the fc .",
    "let @xmath43 be the channel fading matrix between the @xmath19-th sensor and the fc .",
    "@xmath44 is assumed to be known to the fc ( as it can be obtained via advanced channel estimation techniques ) .",
    "let @xmath45 be the receiver - end complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , @xmath46 .",
    "the signal received at the fusion center is therefore given by : @xmath47 where the compound noise vector @xmath48 is still gaussian : @xmath49 whose covariance matrix @xmath50 is @xmath51    it should be noted that the whiteness assumption of the gaussian noise @xmath45 at the receiver does not undermine the generality of the model .",
    "indeed if @xmath52 has coloured covariance @xmath53 , by redefining @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the received signal can be equivalently written as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , which falls into the model in ( [ eq : received_signal ] ) .      in the beamforming problem that targets mmse ,",
    "a linear postcoder is usually employed on the destination end ( i.e. the fc ) , and should be optimized together with the precoders at the transmitter end ( i.e. sensors ) . in comparison , the definition of the mutual information does not include the receiver in the equation .",
    "this is due to the fundamental conclusion in information theory that mutual information can not increase whatever signal processing procedure is performed at the receiver .",
    "the mutual information between the source @xmath0 and the reception at the fc is given in equation ( [ eq : mi_full_definition ] ) shown in the next page :    @xmath59    in practice , each sensor has independent transmit power constraint in accordance to individual battery supply .",
    "the average transmit power for the @xmath19-th sensor is @xmath60 , which must abide by its power constraint @xmath61 .",
    "thus the beamformer design problem of the noisy - observation sensing problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem :    [ eq : uniform_problem ] @xmath62    the above optimization problem is nonconvex , which can be easily shown by examining the convexity of the special case where @xmath63 are all scalars .",
    "convex problems are difficult , and can not be solved in one shot . below",
    "we tackle it using the popular bca framework .",
    "the idea of bca is to decompose the original problem of simultaneously optimizing the entire cohort of variables to multiple subproblems , each optimizing a subset of variables .",
    "however , for problem ( @xmath64 ) , directly applying the bca method to partition the beamformers that await to be optimized into subgroups does not help simplify the problem . even if we target only one beaformer at a time , the objective function is still very hard to maximize .",
    "inspired by the weighted mean square error method proposed by the seminal papers @xcite and @xcite , we introduce auxiliary variables to convert the objective into a bca - friendly form and subsequently decompose the problem into solvable subproblems .",
    "we first introduce two useful lemmas which pave the way for transforming the original hard problem ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "similarly , the second quadratic term in ( [ eq : quadratic_terms ] ) can also be proved to be convex function of @xmath71 .",
    "thus ( [ eq : opt_prob_trace_we ] ) is a non - constrained convex problem of @xmath71 . by setting the derivative with respective to @xmath71 to zero",

    "thus @xmath106 is actually a convex function with respect to @xmath109 .",
    "now , we replace @xmath109 with @xmath110 . since @xmath111 is an affine ( actually linear ) transformation of variables @xmath63 , and affine operations preserve convexity , the following function @xmath112 is therefore convex with respect to the set of variables @xmath63 .    finally , to identify the convexity of the objective in ( [ eq : opt_prob_p8 ] ) , it suffices to prove that the nonlinear terms of @xmath63 are also convex .",
    "the nonlinear terms are given by @xmath113 again , based on the discussion at the beginning of this proof ( i.e. ( [ eq : ffff ] ) is convex ) , we can see that each of above terms is convex and thus the entire objective is convex . following the same line of reasoning ,",
