    "the brauer - picard group of @xmath5 @xcite , denoted @xmath7 , consists of equivalence classes of invertible exact @xmath5-bimodule categories , endowed with the group law induced by a natural ( but technically involved ) notion of tensor product .",
    "it is an important invariant of @xmath5 , but it seems to be very difficult to compute , or even difficult to find non - trivial subgroups of it .",
    "the brauer - picard group of @xmath5 also coincides with the brauer group of the drinfeld center of @xmath5 as defined in @xcite , in terms of azumaya algebras , see @xcite .",
    "if @xmath8 is the category of finite - dimensional representations of a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath9 , then the brauer - picard group is known as the strong brauer of @xmath9 @xcite , which is also notoriously known to be difficult to compute : see @xcite for the latest developments ( for the case of the sweedler algebra ) before the new technology from @xcite , and see @xcite for recent computations .",
    "a key result to understand the brauer - picard group is given in @xcite , where it is shown to be isomorphic with @xmath10 , the group of isomorphism classes of braided auto - equivalences of the drinfeld center of @xmath5 , thus providing a more tractable description . since any tensor auto - equivalence of @xmath5 obviously induces a braided tensor auto - equivalence of @xmath11 , there exists a group morphism from @xmath12 ( the group of isomorphism classes of tensor auto - equivalences of @xmath5 ) into @xmath10 , and hence into @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the study of @xmath12 seems to be an important step to understand the structure of the brauer - picard group .",

    "this result is very useful to construct tensor auto - equivalences , and schauenburg has moreover developed some powerful techniques to describe and study ( bi-)galois objects over a given hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how to use these techniques to compute the group of bi - galois objects over @xmath16 at an odd root of unity , the coordinate algebra of the frobenius - lusztig kernel of @xmath17 , and hence the group @xmath18 , as follows .",

    "an important difference between the present case of @xmath16 and the few other known computations of groups of bi - galois objects for finite - dimensional non - cosemisimple hopf algebras @xcite is that @xmath16 is not pointed .",
    "thus its seems difficult to use the techniques of these papers .",
    "the key tool used here will be a result by schauenburg in @xcite ( corollary 3.3 there ) , yielding information on galois objects over hopf algebras involved in an exact sequence , together with the fact that the cleft galois objects over @xmath22 are trivial if @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as a consequence of theorem [ main ] , we also show that the lazy cohomology @xcite of @xmath16 is trivial .",
    "note that for @xmath0 not a root of unity , the group of tensor auto - equivalences of the ( semisimple ) tensor category of finite - dimensional @xmath24-modules ( or more generally of @xmath25-modules for @xmath26 a semisimple lie algebra ) is described in @xcite , and is much smaller than the one we get at roots of unity for @xmath27 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 consists of preliminaries , mainly on galois and bi - galois objects over hopf algebras .",
    "in particular we provide a detailed exposition of ( a particular case of ) schauenburg s corollary 3.3 in @xcite , of which we provide a variation adapted to bi - galois objects ( corollary [ corobigal ] ) .",
