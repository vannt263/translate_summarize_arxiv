    "we observe that the operators in table [ qcoh ] account for half of all the brst cohomology elements in the @xmath0 string , as enumerated in @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the full spectrum of the @xmath83 theory within the improved unitarity bound @xcite is given by @xmath84 .",
    "the states of the coset therefore have to descend from this hilbert space .",
    "it is therefore important to check whether the states in the cohomology of @xmath85 we have found ( that match to the @xmath0 string ) can be rewritten as states descending from spectrally flowed representations . in this section , we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we first make a few observations about spectral flow :    @xmath86    consider a state in the coset @xmath87 with : l_0^cig =- j(j+1)+m^2j^3_0=m = 0 j^r_0=2 m .",
    "this descends from a state in the parent theory with l_0=-j(j+1)j^3_0=m = 0 .",
    "a spectral flow by @xmath88 units takes this state to another state with l_0=-j(j+1)+ - j^3_0=m+ = -w .",
    "this state descends in the cigar to @xmath89 with : l_0^cig =- j(j+1)+m^2 j^3_0=m+ = -w j^r_0= 2 m .",
    "in particular , the dimension and @xmath90-charge of the state in the coset does not change .",
    "the fermion number ( @xmath91 ghost number in the @xmath0 theory ) changes by @xmath88 units .    the operator @xmath92 in the untwisted theory changes the dimension and @xmath90-charge of a state by @xmath93 , and therefore acts on the @xmath85 cohomology .",
    "this operator also decreases the fermion number by @xmath80 unit . recall that this is identical to the inverse-@xmath76 operation mentioned in subsection [ qcohom ] .    following the construction in section [ cprimary ] , we now give an algorithm that allows us to obtain all physical states of the @xmath0 theory starting with the operator @xmath94 and doing the operations of spectral flow , finding descendants using the operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the  inverse - a \" operation ( acting with @xmath77 ) .",
    "all these are operations strictly within the untwisted coset theory .",
    "the resulting states in the twisted theory will be brst cohomology elements .",
    "@xmath86    start with the operator @xmath97 which has dimension and @xmath90-charge given by @xmath98 in the untwisted theory . from table",
    "[ qcoh ] , we see that in the topological theory , this maps to the state _",
    "-,= y^+_0,0 = y^-_0,0 = c e^- .",
    "we will obtain other states in the @xmath0 theory by repeatedly applying a two - step procedure : ( a ) spectral flow by one unit , ( b ) act by @xmath92 .",
    "the operator that implements the spectral flow can be explicitly written out in wakimoto variables as u = c ^-1 e^x e^- .",
    "acting with @xmath99 on @xmath100 results in c c ^-1 e^- e^x = ay^- _ , , where the explicit representatives are given in @xcite . from table",
    "[ qcoh ] , this operation ( in coset variables ) takes a state @xmath101 to a state @xmath102 and amounts to exchanging the two limits of the improved bound @xmath103 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath99 indeed implements spectral flow . acting on this state with @xmath77",
    "removes the factor of @xmath76 and we thus get @xmath104 .",
    "the corresponding operator in the untwisted theory has @xmath105 .",
    "more generally , if we start with a state at ghost number one with @xmath106 , what we have shown is that spectral flow by one unit @xmath107 preserves the @xmath108 as shown above .",
    "then act by @xmath92 to get a state at ghost number one with @xmath109 . in this way",
    ", one can generate all the states of the form @xmath110 .",
    "once we have generated the chiral states with arbitrary low dimension , we can use the construction of subsection [ qcohom ] and get the rest of @xmath111  acting with @xmath112 .",
    "let us now spectral flow in the opposite direction ( using @xmath113 ) starting with the same operator @xmath100 , but now reversing the steps : ( a ) multiply by @xmath76 , ( b ) act with @xmath113 .",
    "we get c e^-x e^- = y^+_,- . where we have again taken explicit representatives from @xcite . repeating this two step procedure",
    "we generate all states of the form @xmath114 ( and their ghost number two partners ) .",
    "as before , we can use the construction of [ qcohom ] and get the rest of @xmath115 by acting with @xmath112 .",
    "we have thus completely generated the states in the @xmath3nd and @xmath116th rows of table [ qcoh ] as follows :  y^+_,- ay^+_0,0",
    "y^_0,0 ay^- _ , y^- _ ,     but now , note from table [ qcoh ] that the elements @xmath114 and @xmath110 _ also _ appear in the @xmath41rd and @xmath80st rows respectively .",
    "thus , the descent operations on these particular states ( i.e. finding null vectors in the verma modules ) will give us all the discrete states at ghost number @xmath80 , as well as their partners at ghost number two / zero obtained by multiplying / inverting @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we can reconstruct all the elements in table [ qcoh ] .    to summarize",
    ", what we have shown is that given the operator @xmath117 along with the states one can obtain from it by spectral flow , and using operations intrinsic to the coset theory ( such as acting with @xmath77 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) , one can generate _ all _ physical operators in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "we would like to point out that most of these chiral operators in the coset have @xmath120 .",
    "the only operators which do are the chiral primary = 2 liouville interaction operators , which map to the liouville interaction in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "so far , the analysis of section [ qcohom ] has enabled us to identify the quantum numbers of the operators on the coset side that maps to the tachyonic operators @xmath121 in the @xmath0 string and in equation , we have an explicit realization in terms of wakimoto variables .",
    "however , in the next sections where we compare disc one point functions that define d - branes in the two theories , the relative normalization of the closed string fields becomes relevant .",
    "in this section , we fix the precise relative normalization between the cigar chiral primaries and the @xmath0 tachyonic operators @xmath121 by using the reflection amplitudes for closed strings in the two backgrounds .",
    "in particular , we will consider certain winding operators on the @xmath0 string side that will couple to neumann branes ( in the @xmath0 direction ) .",
    "we recall that there are operators in the @xmath0 theory which are the reflections of off the liouville wall : [ vttachyon ] _",
    "e^-(j+ ) e^-i(j+ ) ( x- ) . these operators with @xmath95 @xmath122 times .",

    "have the opposite @xmath48 momentum as @xmath121 , and the same exponent of @xmath61 .",
    "they are related to the operators as @xcite ( with @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 from the cigar theory , we can simply understand them as reflections off the tip .",
    "operators in the coset with @xmath127 and @xmath128 are also related by a reflection amplitude @xcite ( we are restricting to specific @xmath129 fields ) : [ cosetref ] _ j ,- j , j = r(j ,- j , j ) _",
    "-j-1,-j , j . with @xmath130 \\cdot ( \\gamma(-2j))^2 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the observables @xmath131 in the @xmath0 string are mapped to @xmath132 of the coset , we see from that @xmath133 maps to the operators @xmath134 in the coset .",
    "we shall use these amplitudes to fix the relative normalization between the coset and @xmath0 string operators .",
    "we may write [ norm ] _ j ,- j , j = ^2 s(j)_-j-1,-j , j = ( -2j ) , which tells us that [ normop ] _ j ,- j , j ( -2j ) _ j _ -j-1,-j , j _ -j-1 .",
    "we will see later that these relative normalizations are indeed the natural ones when we compare the disc one - point functions of the respective branes in the two theories .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss a few target space geometrical aspects of the bulk theory .",
    "we note that this subsection is technically somewhat orthogonal to the rest of the paper .",
    "we discuss some features of the well known claim @xcite that the @xmath0 string theory is equivalent to the topological b - model on the deformed conifold defined as a hypersurface in @xmath135 : [ defconifold ] (    cc a_1 & a_4 a_3 & a_2    ) = a_1a_2 -a_3a_4 = .",
    "to support the claim , we review in some detail the construction of the analog of the holomorphic three - form in the @xmath0 bosonic string language .",
    "the holomorphic three - form can locally be written as : = .",

    "one can dualize the three - form to the vector field @xmath141 : [ s ] s = x _ x + y _ y - x _ x - y _ y. in @xcite , there is a precise dictionary between physical vertex operators in the @xmath0 string and vector fields and differential forms on the conifold . from the above reasoning",

    "representation_. the reason is the same as to why only odd dimensional reps are allowed on the fzzt branes in this theory @xcite , and boils down to the fact that the conformal dimension ( r charge ) of a closed string operator is the sum of the left and right dimensions ( r charge ) .",

    "this corresponds to the wilson line on the zz brane .",
    "the two open string `` moduli '' above are not dimension one operators on the physical branes in the superstring theory involving this coset , such a brane would have no moduli ( _ e.g. _ the localized branes constructed in @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath189 is the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we shall explicitly write them out in the following section . for now , we focus on a similar discussion of extended branes in the coset cft following @xcite .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is in the context of @xmath1 liouville theory with boundary , which is just the mirror theory to the one we have been considering . in particular",
    ", there is a precise map between the extended a - branes in that theory and the extended b - branes we consider .",
    "these can again be described in terms of a boundary interaction term s_bdy = -_b dx ( | - |)(^+^- - i ) e^- q the common link between the two boundary interactions is that these are  holomorphic square roots \" of bulk screening operators @xcite .",

    ", we find that the topological open string operators labeled by an half - integer @xmath166 can be mapped to the marginal operators @xmath195 of the fzzt branes .",

    "we have revisited the correspondence between the topological cigar at level one and the @xmath0 string theory and clarified the discussion in @xcite regarding the mapping of bulk operators .",
    "we have reproduced the states listed in the appendix of @xcite in our analysis , and in our description the identification of the states in the list as null vectors in the verma modules of the affine @xmath14 current algebra is made manifest .",
    "cohomology used in the comparison of the @xmath0 string amplitudes to the amplitudes derived from the landau - ginzburg model as described in @xcite . ] the same procedure also allowed us to precisely map the states in the list to specific representatives of the topological observables using the wakimoto variables .",

    "the states that naively seem to descend from representations labeled by different @xmath15 values are understood to descend from the spectrally flowed representations .",
    "these results teach us a little about the relation of the topological theory on the cigar with the physical superstring theory .",
    "to compare the spectrum and correlation functions in the @xmath27 model on the cigar to those of the @xmath0 theory , we use the untwisted cigar scft and restrict to states which formally obey the chiral primary condition .",
    "most of these states are not of dimension one , but could be tensored with other states to produce on - shell states in a superstring theory on a larger spacetime involving the cigar , as done in @xcite .",
    "we matched the one point functions that define the d@xmath79/d@xmath3 branes in the topological coset with the zz / fzzt branes of the @xmath0 string theory .",
    "further , we mapped the open string deformations for the two kinds of branes and also the boundary two point function on the extended d@xmath3 and fzzt brane .",
    "the statements in the above paragraph also apply to the open string modes on the branes in the topological theory .    at various places in the paper",
    ", we have a discussion of the @xmath143 symmetry intrinsic to the @xmath0 theory .",
    "the closed @xmath0 string theory has a @xmath204 symmetry , and this is also a symmetry of the topological string theory on the coset .",
    "however , the currents that generate these symmetries are not dimension one currents in the untwisted scft and and so do not generate symmetries of the superstring theory involving this coset ( _ e.g. _ cigar @xmath205 ) .",

    "based on the identification of the closed string theory with the topological theory on the deformed conifold , it is natural to identify the localized ( compact ) brane with the lagrangian brane wrapping the @xmath208 of the deformed conifold .",
    "we believe that our analysis could be useful in recovering the bps sector of the gauge theory physics for branes on the conifold from an exact worldsheet description",
    ". it would be especially interesting to apply similar techniques to more general non - compact calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "for instance , it would be instructive to compute the superpotential for scalars arising from combinations of d - branes wrapping cycles in the calabi - yau purely from the worldsheet theory .",
    "our analysis could also be helpful to better understand the topological subsector of the ads / cft correspondence , and more generally , holography .",
    "recently , it was shown @xcite that the liouville field emerges as a holographic direction in topological theories involving the @xmath209 current algebra . in the last couple of years ,",
    "holography in theories involving the liouville theory has been understood better using d - branes in these theories @xcite .",
    "the identification of the d - branes in @xmath0 and the d - branes in the topological cigar goes a step towards completing this circle of ideas .",
    "we close by noting that the techniques used to map the closed string observables are not specific to the cigar at level one . in particular , one can do a similar computation for the @xmath210 theories coupled to liouville theory .",
    "recently it was suggested in @xcite that these are related to @xmath211 non - minimal matter coupled to liouville .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat the null vector analysis for @xmath14 at general level @xmath212 to get a better grip on the cohomology of the twisted supercosets , i.e. of the topological string on these @xmath213 superconformal backgrounds , from first principles .",

    "as these fields are independent of the free fermions , they are also primary fields of the superconformal @xmath14 at level @xmath212 . in order to obtain the primaries of the coset , it is useful to bosonize the various currents as follows : @xmath217 where the normalizations ensure that the scalars have canonical opes .",
    "since we have left - right symmetric conventions , there are similar expressions for the right - moving sector as well .",
    "these scalars are not all independent and using the definition of the bosonic currents and the @xmath1 algebra , we can rewrite all scalars in terms of @xmath218 and @xmath219 : @xmath220 the right moving currents have a similar expansion in terms of scalars . given these expressions , and knowing that the current that is gauged in the coset are @xmath216 ( in the bosonic case ) , we can decompose @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a primary of the bosonic euclidean coset cft ( at level @xmath39 ) .",

    "since we havent found an encoding of the extended algebra in terms of ope s in the literature ( although it immediately follows from the algebra in terms of the oscillators @xcite ) , we record it here for the readers convenience :      we have checked all these ope s on the representation in terms of asympotic variables , and also that the currents @xmath256 and @xmath243 have the correct ope s with the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath251 current in accord with their conformal dimension and r - charge .",

    "the operator @xmath90 is a chiral primary operator in the untwisted theory with conformal dimension and r - charge @xmath259 . from equation in the bulk of the paper",
    ", it follows that it can be mapped to the left - moving part of the operator @xmath260 , which has the @xmath0 representation [ omega ] r(z)ce^-i x(z ) . from the definition of the operator @xmath261 in , and the mapping of the supercurrent @xmath262 in",
