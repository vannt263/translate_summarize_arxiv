    "the einstein equations have been a source of several interesting problems in physics , analysis and geometry . despite the great deal of work that has been devoted to them , with many success stories ,",
    "several important questions remain ( see @xcite for an account of what is currently known and some directions of future research ) .",
    "one of them is finding a satisfactory theory of isolated systems , such as stars , both from a perspective of the time development of the space - time , as well as from the point of view of the geometry induced on a space - like three surface . to quote rendall , `` of the physical situations which can be described by the general theory of relativity , those which are at",
    "the present most accessible to observation are the isolated systems .",
    "in fact , all existing tests of einstein s equations concern such situations . it is therefore important to have a theory of these systems which is as complete as possible , not only in terms of the range of phenomena which are covered but also with respect to logical and mathematical solidity '' @xcite .",
    "stars are the prototypes of isolated systems .",
    "they are typically modeled by considering a region of space filled with a fluid and separated from an exterior that corresponds to vacuum .",
    "the properties of the fluid , such as perfection , viscosity , charge , etc . ,",
    "depend on the particular situation one is interested in .",
    "the dynamics of the fluid region is then described by einstein equations coupled to matter , whereas vacuum einstein equations hold on the complement of this set . from the point of view of the cauchy problem , which will be the main case of interest in this work , there are two primary questions to be addressed .",
    "\\(i ) first , the solvability of einstein equations in the two different situations of interest , i.e. , coupled to fluid sources and in vacuum , should be addressed .",
    "since the short - time existence for vacuum einstein equations is well understood ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this leaves us with the coupling to matter .",
    "a specific matter model has then to be chosen , and one of the most customary choices , sufficient for many applications , is that of a perfect fluid @xcite , in which case einstein equations are coupled to the ( relativistic ) euler equations .",
    "the well - posedness of this system was proven by choquet - bruhat @xcite and extended by lichnerowicz @xcite to include entropy  in which case the resulting system will be called the einstein - euler - entropy system , whose equations are stated in section [ eee_system_section ] .",
    "\\(ii ) the second question is more delicate and consists of trying to bring together the two different scenarios described in the previous paragraph , namely , vacuum and coupling to matter .",
    "more precisely , we attempt to formulate and solve the cauchy problem with an interior region  thought of as the star  governed by the einstein - euler ( or einstein - euler - entropy ) equations and an exterior one that evolves according to the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "this corresponds to a genuine free - boundary problem in that the boundary of the star can not be prescribed for time @xmath0 , being rather a dynamic quantity that has to be determined from the evolution equations .",
    "the star boundary at time zero is obtained as the boundary of the support @xmath1 of the initial matter density @xmath2 , which is a function on the initial cauchy surface typically of the form @xmath3 solving the cauchy problem then requires a refined analysis of the boundary behavior of the quantities involved , where the change from @xmath4 to @xmath5 causes severe technical difficulties ( here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the einstein and stress - energy tensor , respectively ) .",
    "lindbom @xcite has proven that any isolated static fluid stellar model ought to be spherically symmetric , generalizing a classical result of carleman and lichtenstein for newtonian fluids @xcite .",
    "more precisely , he has shown that a static asymptotically flat space - time that contains only a uniform density perfect fluid confined to a spatially compact world tube is necessarily spherical symmetric .    under the assumption of spherical symmetry",
    ", it is possible to deal with many of the technicalities that arise , and a number of satisfactory and general results have been obtained .",
    "rendall and schmidt have proven existence and uniqueness results for global solutions of the einstein - euler system @xcite .",
    "they also gave a detailed account of how the properties of these solutions depend on features of the equation of state .",
    "kind and ehlers have treated the mixed initial - boundary value problem in @xcite , where they have also given necessary and sufficient conditions for attaching the solutions they constructed to a schwarzschild space - time .",
    "makino @xcite refined the results of rendall and schmidt by providing a general criterion for the equation of state , which ensures that the model has finite radius ( and therefore finite mass ) .",
    "this result is used to study the linear stability of the equations of motion .",
    "regarding the relation between mass and radius , in @xcite the authors derive , among other results , interesting mass - radius theorems .",
    "a very extensive treatment of the cauchy problem for spherically symmetric data is given in the work of groah , smoller , and temple @xcite .",
    "these works do not exhaust all the results known in spherical symmetry ; see the references in the above papers for more details .",
    "if we drop the hypothesis of spherical symmetry , however , not much is known about the well - posedness of the cauchy problem when the matter density is allowed to vanish outside a compact set , as in ( [ intro_matter_vanish ] )  a situation generally referred to as a `` fluid body '' .",
    "one could attempt to change @xmath2 to a function that is always positive , but decays sufficiently fast and is very small in the region outside @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , this does not improve things considerably because generally the time - span of solutions can not be shown to be uniform , and as a result , the domain of definition of the solution contains no space - like slice @xmath8constant ( except obviously the @xmath9 slice ) .",
    "another problem which arises in this context is that the usual conformal method for solving the constraint equations @xcite can not be applied .",
    "following the ideas of makino @xcite , who studied non - relativistic gaseous stars , rendall has shown that the above problems can be circumvented for fluids obeying certain equations of state @xcite  although , as the author himself points out , the solutions obtained in these cases have the undesirable property of not including statically spherically symmetric space - times , and the restrictions on the equation of state are too strong .",
    "initial data sets for the einstein - euler equations describing a fluid body have been successfully constructed by brauer and karp @xcite and dain and nagy @xcite , but well - posedness of the system with such prescribed initial values has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "therefore , the solution to the cauchy problem for a self - gravitating isolated fluid body is still largely open ( although some recent results of brauer and karp @xcite address directly some of the technical issues we referred to ) .",
    "an important step forward has been achieved by friedrich in @xcite . using a lagrangian description of the fluid motion",
    ", he has been able to derive a set of reduced equations which form a first order symmetric hyperbolic system .",
    "while it has been known that the vacuum einstein equations can be cast in such a form since the work of fischer and marsden @xcite , and the einstein - euler system had also been investigated within the formalism of first order symmetric hyperbolic systems in the aforementioned work of rendall , what makes friedrich s construction particularly attractive is the use of the lagrangian description of the fluid flow , as it is known that lagrangian coordinates are uniquely suited for treating free boundary problems involving the non - relativistic euler equations , and have in fact been employed to a great success to study them @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether friedrich s ideas will lead to satisfactory existence theorems for the cauchy problem for fluid bodies .",
    "but for such a project to be successful , one needs to be able to carry out step ( i ) as explained above , namely , to use the reduced system of @xcite to separately solve einstein equations in the cases of vacuum and coupled to fluid matter .",
    "only then the passage across the boundary from the einstein - euler - entropy to the vacuum equations can be analyzed .",
    "notice that in the case of vacuum , the notion of a lagrangian description is somewhat artificial , but it can be given meaning by the choice of a time - like vector field which should agree with the fluid four - velocity once matter is introduced .",
    "well - posedness of the vacuum einstein equations using the formalism of @xcite has been established in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves us with the question of well - posedness of the einstein - euler - entropy system . in other words ,",
    "we seek a solution to the following :    _ establish a well - posedness result for the einstein - euler - entropy system with a general equation of state , by writing the set of equations as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system via a lagrangian description of the fluid flow , as in @xcite , and under the assumption that the fluid fills the entire initial cauchy surface @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 , with possibly additional hypotheses consistent with physical requirements . _    this is the problem addressed and solved in this work .",
    "some terminology is needed before we can make a precise statement  see theorem [ main_theorem ] in section [ eee_system_section ] .",
    "we stress that theorem [ main_theorem ] had been proven much earlier by choquet - bruhat @xcite and lichnerowicz @xcite . what is new is the method of proof , employing the lagrangian description of the fluid flow .",
    "it should also be noticed that , while the equations we use are essentially those of @xcite and @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , a complete proof of well - posedness relying on friedrich s techniques is not available in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basic_setting ] , we recall several basic definitions , fix our notation , introduce the main equations and hypotheses , and state the main theorem . in section [ frame_formalism ] , we introduce the frame formalism and gauge conditions that constitute the basis of friedrich s method . the gauged or reduced einstein - euler - entropy system",
    "is also presented in this section .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is carried out in section [ proof_main_theorem_section ] .",
    "it consists of three parts : determination of the initial data ( section [ initial_data_section ] ) , well - posedness of the reduced system ( section [ well_posedness_reduced_section ] ) , and the `` propagation of the gauge '' ( section [ propagation_gauge ] ) .",
    "this last step is what guarantees that a solution of the einstein - euler - entropy system in a particular gauge  the reduced system  yields a solution to the original set of equations .",
    "finally , in section [ further ] , we make some closing remarks .",
    "we have chosen to present our arguments in a logical rather than constructive order .",
    "this means that instead of starting by showing how the reduced equations are obtained from the einstein - euler - entropy system by means of a gauge choice , we first state the reduced equations , then derive its solutions , and finally show that they correspond to solutions of the original equations of motion . this particular order",
    "is adopted because the equations we use in both the reduced and the propagation of the gauge systems are equivalent to those of @xcite and @xcite , although we shall write them in a slightly different fashion .",
    "hence , as they have been considered before , there is no immediate need to show how the reduced equations are extracted from the original ones by a suitable choice of gauge .",
    "this procedure is briefly presented nonetheless in the appendix for the reader s convenience . those not familiar with the work @xcite are encouraged to read appendix [ derivation_appendix ] prior to section [ proof_main_theorem_section ] .",
    "the sobolev space between manifolds @xmath12 and @xmath13 will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "when no confusion can arise , the reference to @xmath13 will be suppressed , and @xmath14 will be written @xmath15 , or even @xmath16 when @xmath12 is clear from the context . @xmath17 denotes the uniformly local sobolev spaces , whose definition is recalled in appendix [ ul_sobolev_appendix ] .",
    "our main object of study is a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath18 , called a space - time . in general relativity , we are interested in the sub - class of lorentzian manifolds where einstein equations are satisfied .",
    "we recall that these are @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the ricci and scalar curvature of the metric @xmath22 , @xmath7 is the stress - energy tensor which encodes information about the matter fields , and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the speed of light and @xmath25 newton s constant , and we adopt units where @xmath26 , we could set @xmath27 .",
    "but since we will be working with a lesser familiar formalism , it is useful to keep the constant @xmath28 , in which case it is always possible to set @xmath29 in order to compare the resulting equations with the well studied vacuum case . ] . a space - time",
    "is called an einsteinian space - time when ( [ einstein_eq ] ) is satisfied .",
    "@xmath30 will always be assumed to be oriented and time - oriented .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ einstein_eq ] ) is divergence free as a consequence of the bianchi identities .",
    "hence , regardless of the particular matter model which is considered , the stress energy tensor has to satisfy @xmath31 which then gives equations of motion for the matter fields ( see section [ eee_system_section ] below ) ; @xmath32 in ( [ conservation_t ] ) denotes the levi - civita connection associated with @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ conservation_t ] ) is sometimes referred to as the local law of momentum and energy conservation .    throughout the paper",
    "we shall adopt the convention @xmath33 for the metric .",
    "a fluid source is a triple @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a domain of a space - time and @xmath36 a time - like vector field on @xmath37 of unit norm .",
    "physically , the trajectories of @xmath36 represent the flow lines of matter .",
    "given a fluid source , the stress - energy tensor of a perfect fluid is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , called the pressure of the fluid , and @xmath40 , called the density of the fluid , are non - negative real valued functions .",
    "a perfect fluid source is a fluid source together with a stress - energy tensor given by ( [ perfect_fluid_source ] ) .",
    "perfect fluid sources , or perfect fluids for short , are often used to study space - times where a continuous distribution of matter exists ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption that matter is described by a stress - energy tensor of the form ( [ perfect_fluid_source ] ) means that no dissipation of any sort is present ; in particular one neglects possible effects due to heat conduction , viscosity or shear stresses ) , can be motivated from basic physical principles , which can be taken as characterizing ideal fluids ; see e.g. @xcite . ] .    for perfect fluids , equation ( [ conservation_t ] )",
    "becomes @xmath41 taking the inner product of ( [ conservation_t_perfect ] ) with @xmath36 and using @xmath42 ( which also implies @xmath43 ) , gives @xmath44 known as the conservation of energy or continuity equation .",
    "then , using ( [ euler_1 ] ) into ( [ conservation_t_perfect ] ) produces @xmath45 known as conservation of momentum equation .",
    "together , equations ( [ euler_1 ] ) and ( [ euler_2 ] ) are known as the euler equations for a relativistic fluid .    in physically relevant models ,",
    "the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not independent but are related by what is called an equation of state , which is an ( usually smooth ) invertible function @xmath46 fluids where ( [ barotropic ] ) is satisfied are called barotropic fluids , with the particular case @xmath47 called dust or pressure - free matter .",
    "physical situations of interest where barotropic fluids are employed include some models of cold ( more precisely , zero temperature ) matter , such as completely degenerate cold neutron gases ( which are used to model nuclear matter in the interior of neutron stars ) @xcite ; the so - called ultra - relativistic fluids , i.e. , fluids in thermal equilibrium where the energy ( which in relativistic terms is described by @xmath40 due to the equivalence of mass and energy ) is largely dominated by radiation @xcite ; and fluids of electron - positron pairs @xcite .",
    "barotropic fluids are also important in cosmology , where several models of the early universe assume that the distribution of matter is described by an ultra - relativistic fluid @xcite .    as usual in general relativity ,",
    "space - time itself is a dynamic quantity , therefore its geometry , encoded in the metric @xmath22 , as well as the the dynamics of other fields present on space - time , have to be determined as solutions to the einstein equations ( [ einstein_eq ] ) coupled to matter via ( [ conservation_t ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the fluid source @xmath48 is not a given , but has to arise from the solutions of the coupled system .",
    "the einstein - euler system for barotropic fluids , or barotropic einstein - euler system , is given by equations ( [ einstein_eq ] ) , ( [ euler_1 ] ) , ( [ euler_2 ] ) , and ( [ barotropic ] ) , with @xmath7 given by ( [ perfect_fluid_source ] ) , and subject to the constraint @xmath49 . the unknowns to be determined are the metric @xmath22 , the four - velocity @xmath36 , and the matter density @xmath40 .",
    "the einstein - euler system for barotropic fluids has been studied by many authors .",
    "in fact , most of the results cited in the introduction deal with this case .",
    "the interested reader can consult the papers @xcite and the monographes @xcite , as well as the references therein .",
    "similar to the well - known case of vacuum einstein equations @xcite , when addressing the solvability of the barotropic einstein - euler system , one has to investigate its constraints and make suitable choices for the spaces where solutions will be sought . since we shall deal with the more general case of fluids that are not necessarily barotropic , we postpone this discussion for the time being , turning our attention first to some thermodynamic tools that will be necessary in the sequel .",
    "we shall return to the barotropic case in section [ further ] .",
    "there are important scenarios where it is known that the pressure is not determined by the matter density only .",
    "these include the so - called polytropic fluids , which are used in several stellar models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in such cases , ( [ barotropic ] ) has to be replaced by a more general equation of state involving other physical quantities , which are usually assumed to be of thermodynamic nature , as we now describe .    as in many situations in general relativity , it is important to identify those quantities measured by a local inertial observer .",
    "let @xmath50 be the rest mass ( or energy ) , we shall use the terms mass and energy interchangeably . ]",
    "density , defined as the mass density measured in the local rest frame .",
    "it is assumed that this quantity obeys the conservation law @xmath51 which states that mass is ( locally ) conserved .",
    "notice that on dimensional grounds , @xmath52 is the specific ( i.e. , per unit of mass ) volume .",
    "the difference between the mass density @xmath40 and the rest mass density @xmath50 is by definition the specific internal energy @xmath53 ( as measured in the local rest frame ) : @xmath54 therefore , as @xmath39 , @xmath50 and @xmath40 , @xmath53 is a real valued function on @xmath55 . in the context of relativistic fluids , the relation ( [ internal_energy ] )",
    "has been first introduced by taub @xcite and has been widely used since @xcite .    for non - barotropic fluids ,",
    "further relations among the variables of the problem have to be introduced in order to have a well - determined system of equations .",
    "it is natural to assume that the first law of thermodynamics holds , i.e. , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the absolute temperature , @xmath58 the specific entropy , and @xmath59 the specific volume .",
    "these are all non - negative real valued functions on @xmath37 . in light of ( [ internal_energy ] ) and @xmath60 , the first law",
    "can be written as is well defined because of ( [ internal_energy ] ) .",
    "the case of vanishing @xmath40 is , however , important , as explained in the introduction . ]",
    "@xmath61 we now turn to the generalization of ( [ barotropic ] ) , i.e. , to the appropriate equation of state that has to be provided .",
    "although we presently have seven thermodynamic variables , namely , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath50 , @xmath53 , @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 , the above equations imply relations among them .",
    "in fact , for a perfect fluid , only two of such quantities are independent @xcite , with the remaining ones determined by relations depending exclusively on the nature of the fluid . on physical grounds",
    ", we should assume that such relations are invertible , what renders the question of which two thermodynamical quantities are the independent ones a matter of preference .",
    "we shall assume henceforth that @xmath50 and @xmath58 are independent .",
    "we thus postulate an equation of state of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a given smooth function , invertible in the sense that we can solve for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . from ( [ first_law ] ) and ( [ eq_of_state ] )",
    "we then obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 the validity of ( [ first_law ] ) along with ( [ euler_1 ] ) implies @xmath68 therefore , in light of ( [ rest_mass_conservation ] ) , and assuming that the temperature is not zero ( which is consistent with ( [ temperature ] ) and ( [ eq_of_state ] ) ) , @xmath69 in other words , the entropy is conserved along the flow lines of the fluid .",
    "when ( [ loc_adiabatic ] ) holds , the motion of the fluid is said to be locally adiabatic .",
    "a fluid is said to be isentropic if @xmath70constant , and non - sentropic otherwise .",
    "if ( [ rest_mass_conservation ] ) is not assumed , then from ( [ derivation_loc_adiabatic ] ) it only follows that @xmath71 and @xmath72 although these two inequalities have a clear physical interpretation  from the point of view of inertial observers the rest mass can not increase and the entropy can not decrease  if ( [ rest_mass_conservation ] ) , and therefore ( [ loc_adiabatic ] ) , is not assumed , the motion of the fluid is underdetermined .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics , equation ( [ first_law ] ) , will always be assumed to hold , therefore , because of ( [ derivation_loc_adiabatic ] ) , we shall work with ( [ loc_adiabatic ] ) rather than ( [ rest_mass_conservation ] ) to form our system of equations .",
    "the einstein - euler - entropy system is the system comprised of equations ( [ einstein_eq ] ) , ( [ euler_1 ] ) , ( [ euler_2 ] ) , ( [ eq_of_state ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) , ( [ loc_adiabatic ] ) , subject to the constraint @xmath49 , with @xmath7 given by ( [ perfect_fluid_source ] ) , and @xmath63 in ( [ eq_of_state ] ) a given smooth invertible function .",
    "the unknowns to be determined are the metric @xmath22 , the four - velocity @xmath36 , the rest mass density @xmath50 , and the specific entropy @xmath58 .    for previous works on the einstein - euler - entropy system",
    ", the reader can consult the monographes @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the cauchy problem , therefore we need to state what the initial data are .",
    "this should consist of the usual initial data for the einstein equations and initial data for the matter fields .",
    "these have to satisfy suitable constraint equations , as we now recall .",
    "because of our signature convention , the metric @xmath73 on the initial three slice @xmath10 is negative - definite , a fact which we stress by calling the pair @xmath74 a negative riemannian manifold .",
    "a pre - initial data set for the einstein equations , or pre - initial data set for short , is a triple @xmath75 , where @xmath74 is a three - dimensional negative riemannian manifold and @xmath76 a symmetric two - tensor on @xmath10 .",
    "a development of a pre - initial data set @xmath75 is a space - time @xmath18 which admits an isometric embedding of @xmath74 , with @xmath76 being the second fundamental form of the embedding .",

    "@xmath113 is well defined in that , for physically relevant equations of state , pressure can not decrease as @xmath40 increases .",
    "the fact that ( [ sound_speed ] ) is correctly interpreted as the speed of acoustic waves follows from analyzing the characteristic manifolds of the system formed by equations ( [ euler_1 ] ) , ( [ euler_2 ] ) , ( [ loc_adiabatic ] ) and ( [ eq_of_state ] ) with a given background metric ; we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "we shall require that the following inequalities hold :    [ positivity_conditions ] @xmath114    ( [ sound_speed_positive ] ) and ( [ sound_speed_causal ] ) assert the physical requirements that the sound speed is positive and does not exceed the speed of light ) happens if , and only if , the four - divergence of @xmath36 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath115 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when this happens , the fluid is called incompressible .",

    "the interpretation of ( [ enthalpy_positive ] ) is that specific enthalpy of the fluid , defined as @xmath116 , is positive . in view of ( [ sound_speed ] ) , it should be noticed that ( [ sound_speed_positive ] ) together with ( [ enthalpy_positive ] ) excludes the possibility of pressure - free matter .",
    "our techniques can be easily adapted to allow such a case nonetheless , leading to a theorem similar to [ main_theorem ] below ( see section [ further ] ) .",
    "when the initial slice @xmath10 is compact and the functions involved continuous , inequalities ( [ sound_speed_positive ] ) and ( [ enthalpy_positive ] ) automatically imply that on @xmath10 @xmath117 for some constant @xmath118 . these conditions are needed to apply certain existence results for first order symmetric hyperbolic systems .",
