    "<S> we present the first extensive test of the critical point symmetry x(5 ) for the @xmath0 degree of freedom , based in part on recent measurements for the @xmath0-band in @xmath1sm . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is good for some observables including the energies and most intra- and inter - band transitions , but there is also a serious discrepancy for one transition .    the recent @xcite proposal of the critical point symmetry x(5 ) describing a vibrator to axial rotor first order phase transition has introduced a new paradigm into the arsenal of nuclear models and has generated considerable interest , both experimental and theoretical . </S>",
    "<S> of course , no nucleus need exhibit exact agreement with such a symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> since nuclei contain integer numbers of nucleons , their properties change discretely with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and a transition region may well by - pass the exact critical point . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , empirical examples of nuclei close to x(5 ) in structure were identified in @xmath1sm @xcite and @xmath4nd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although x(5 ) is parameter - free ( except for scale ) , the overall agreement with the data is quite good . </S>",
    "<S> a notable discrepancy in the absolute scale of inter - band @xmath5 values , discussed in detail in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and very recently , in @xcite , probably reflects the fact that these @xmath2 = 90 nuclei are slightly to the rotor side of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> recently , other candidates for x(5 ) have been discussed @xcite .    to date , </S>",
    "<S> the x(5 ) predictions have been discussed primarily for the yrast and yrare degrees of freedom , that is , for the quasi - ground band and for the sequence of levels built on the @xmath6 level . </S>",
    "<S> however , the solution for the infinite square well ( in @xmath7 ) ansatz underlying x(5 ) involves a separation of variables in the @xmath7 and @xmath0 degrees of freedom , and leads to a full set of predictions for the quasi-@xmath0-vibrational levels as well .    to date , </S>",
    "<S> the most significant comparison of x(5 ) predictions with data for the @xmath0 degree of freedom was presented for @xmath8mo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it includes relative @xmath0-band energies and several branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of the present rapid communication to exploit recent experiments using the grid technique at the ill and polarization measurements of @xmath9 mixing ratios at yale @xcite to present an extensive comparison of x(5 ) with @xmath0-band data in @xmath1sm , the first nucleus proposed to exhibit x(5 ) character . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison , including spins up to @xmath10 , about 15 absolute @xmath5 values , and a number of independent branching ratios , is the most thorough to date .    to compare </S>",
    "<S> these and other data on the @xmath0-band in @xmath1sm with x(5 ) one needs to explicitly solve the x(5 ) equation in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is the bohr hamiltonian @xmath11 + v(\\beta,\\gamma ) ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potential in @xmath7 is taken to be an infinite square well with @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , whereas the potential in @xmath0 is assumed to be harmonic around @xmath17 with @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> approximate solutions can be obtained in the limit of small oscillations in the @xmath0 variable combined with an adiabatic limit to separate the @xmath7 and @xmath0 variables . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th zero of a cylindrical bessel function @xmath22 with @xmath23 for @xmath24 this form reduces to the result obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this solution is valid for both the prolate ( @xmath25 ) and the oblate case ( @xmath26 ) due to the appearance of the irrotational moments of inertia in the bohr hamiltonian which vanish about the symmetry axes . </S>",
    "<S> there is an important difference with the moments of inertia of a rigid rotor , for which the relative sign of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 terms would depend on whether the deformation is prolate or oblate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 values can be obtained from the matrix elements of the quadrupole operator @xmath29 ~. \\label{te2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term describes @xmath30 transitions and the second one @xmath31 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of matrix elements of the quadrupole operator involves an integral over the euler angles @xmath32 , and over the deformation variables @xmath7 and @xmath0 @xmath33 where @xmath34 contains the integral over @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath35 over @xmath0 . in the derivation of the @xmath5 values of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ be2 ] ) we have , just as for the energies , assumed small oscillations in @xmath0 . for @xmath30 transitions </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-integral reduces to the orthonormality condition of the wave functions in @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath36 , whereas for @xmath31 transitions this integral can be interpreted as an intrinsic transition matrix element .    </S>",
    "<S> the four independent coefficients that enter in the calculations , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be determined from two excitation energies , e.g. @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and two b(e2 ) values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 transitions , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in table </S>",
    "<S> i we present the x(5 ) results for the energies of the first two bands with @xmath46 , @xmath24 , and the @xmath0-band with @xmath47 , @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> . the moments of inertia of the ground band and the @xmath0-band are almost identical , and much larger than that of the first excited @xmath24 band . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 values for intraband transitions in the @xmath0-band are shown in table ii , and those for interband transitions to the ground and 0@xmath49 bands in tables iii and iv . </S>",
    "<S> the values are normalized to the @xmath30 ground band transition @xmath50 and the @xmath31 transition @xmath51 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> many of these results are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that while the relative @xmath52 and @xmath0-ground band @xmath5 values are close to the alaga rules , the @xmath53 0@xmath49 band values differ significantly .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . 2 and table v give a comparison with x(5 ) for all known quasi-@xmath0-band energies and absolute @xmath5 values in @xmath1sm . </S>",
    "<S> table vi presents a comparison of the data with x(5 ) for cases where relative @xmath5 values are known . the data in these tables and fig .  2 are taken from refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons in tables v , vi and fig </S>",
    "<S> .  2 , like other x(5 ) predictions , are parameter - free except for scale . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned before , for the @xmath0 degree of freedom , there are two additional scales that must be fixed beyond the normalization in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the yrast and yrare levels . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in table v and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( left ) we have normalized @xmath54 to the experimental value and the @xmath5 values for the @xmath31 transitions to an average of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 transitions . the @xmath57 in - band transitions have the same normalization as for the @xmath30 transitions among the yrast and yrare levels in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and are not affected by the scale factor for the @xmath31 transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are quite interesting . </S>",
    "<S> first , they provide an extensive test of x(5 ) for the @xmath0-degree of freedom . secondly , they exhibit both excellent agreement and at least one severe discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> x(5 ) agrees quite well with the data for the @xmath0-band energies , and far better than other paradigms such as the the axial rotor , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . as with the yrast and yrare levels </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1sm deviates from x(5 ) slightly in the direction of the rotor . </S>",
    "<S> the spacings @xmath58 the odd - even spin couplets ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) are almost exact while the spacings @xmath65 couplets are slightly smaller in x(5 ) compared with the data .    turning to transition rates , </S>",
    "<S> the three known intraband @xmath5 values in the quasi-@xmath0-band are reasonably consistent with the data , and the @xmath5 values to the ground band are in rather good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> of these latter transitions , the agreement is poorest for the @xmath66 , transition [ 0.59 ( 17 ) w.u . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally compared to 2.86 w.u .  in x(5 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> most of the transitions to the yrare , or @xmath6-band , levels are , experimentally , very weak ( or else only upper limits are known ) , and so are the x(5 ) predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is one glaring discrepancy , namely for the @xmath67 transition , whose measured @xmath5 value @xcite is 27(4 ) w.u . , while x(5 ) predicts 0.20 w.u . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this problem may be that , in the x(5 ) solution , the @xmath7 and @xmath0 degrees of freedom are separated . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , calculations with both the iba @xcite and gcm @xcite models , where their coupling is included , predict much higher @xmath68 values , which actually exceed the experimental ones . </S>",
    "<S> we noted earlier that the @xmath53 0@xmath49 band @xmath5 values differ significantly from the alaga rules . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio from the 4@xmath69 level ( @xmath70 0.7 ) is consistent with x(5 ) ( 0.84 ) but differs from the alaga rule ( 2.93 ) </S>",
    "<S> . it would clearly be of interest to measure relative @xmath5 values from higher lying members of the quasi-@xmath0-band to further test the x(5 ) predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the comparison of branching ratios in table vi ( where absolute rates are not known or poorly known ) shows mixed agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the very small values , which are ratios of interband transitions to the ground band to intra - quasi-@xmath0 band transitions , are likewise very small in x(5 ) and in good agreement with the data . however , for the three cases of branching ratios to the ground band , the experimental ratios are about 36 times larger than in x(5 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , considering that x(5 ) is an invariant paradigm based on an infinite square well potential in @xmath7 and a harmonic potential in @xmath0 that is parameter free ( except for scale ) , the agreement is quite good . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the striking disagreement for the @xmath67 transition needs to be better understood . </S>",
    "<S> another area worth investigating are other forms of @xmath71 @xcite and/or @xmath72 , in particular their effects on energies and @xmath5 values . </S>"
