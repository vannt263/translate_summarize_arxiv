    "in the past years , many works have been devoted to the study of anomalous processes at finite temperature and density , and in particular near the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "in particular , pisarski @xcite concluded that the neutral pion decay amplitude @xmath4 vanish when chiral symmetry is restored ( the 4-velocity of the plasma in the observer s frame ) that can enter the general form of thermal amplitudes . ] .",
    "this conclusion is based on a direct calculation of the corresponding diagrams at finite temperature ( and zero density ) in the imaginary time formalism , and on symmetry considerations that forbid certain couplings in the symmetric phase .",
    "an additional conclusion was that this decay might be replaced by @xmath5 in the chirally symmetric phase ( which is allowed by the same symmetry argument ) , as indicated by a calculation of the box diagram at finite temperature .",
    "this result has been confirmed by baier , dirks and kober @xcite and by salcedo @xcite using functional approaches in which one integrates out the fermions at the level of the the generating functional .",
    "salcedo in @xcite gives also general arguments according to which @xmath4 ( or @xmath1 in two dimensions ) should vanish in the chiral phase , and be replaced by amplitudes involving the @xmath0 meson . from a technical perspective , the common point of all these studies is the use at some stage of the imaginary time formalism , in the limit of vanishing external momenta .    in another study ,",
    "one of us @xcite studied how the neutral pion decay amplitude depends on the kinematical configuration of the external legs in order to explain the discrepancies found between @xcite and calculations performed in the real time formalism by @xcite .",
    "to that purpose , the @xmath6 amplitude has been calculated at finite @xmath7 in the real time formalism , in the limit of small external momenta .",
    "it appeared that this limit can not be uniquely defined ( it depends on the path followed to reach the zero momenta point ) and that the results of @xcite concerning this amplitude do not correspond to its on - shell value , but to a different way of reaching the limit .",
    "additionally , the conclusion according to which the pion decay amplitude vanish above the critical point appeared to be questionable since the physical ( on - shell ) amplitude has a non vanishing limit at the critical point .    to accommodate this result with the general arguments provided in @xcite , one can notice that both pisarski s symmetry argument @xcite and salcedo s argument @xcite amount to the fact that one power of the quark mass ( the mass the quarks acquire through the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry , via their coupling to the average value of the @xmath0 field ) appears in the numerator when evaluating the dirac trace associated to anomalous amplitudes .",
    "therefore , since the average value @xmath8 goes to zero in the chiral phase , the numerator vanishes above the critical point .",
    "implicit in the argument is the fact that the correct dimension is provided by inverse powers of the temperature ( as opposed to powers of the quark mass ) , as is the case in the imaginary time formalism at the static point .",
    "in other words , this argument is valid only if the denominator does not vanish when the mass goes to zero .",
    "this is precisely what fails when the amplitude is calculated on shell .",
    "one gets as expected one power of @xmath9 in the numerator , but the denominator turns out to be @xmath10 .",
    "the remaining power of @xmath11 in the denominator indicates that the infrared or collinear behavior of the triangle diagram worsens when @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , as noted in @xcite and @xcite , the constituent quark mass @xmath11 ceases to be the relevant infrared regulator when @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath12 , and should be replaced by a thermal mass of order @xmath12 that do not vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "since an additional property of fermionic thermal masses is that they respect chiral symmetry , this thermal mass can not appear in the dirac s trace . as a consequence the result @xmath13 obtained for the on - shell amplitude in the bare theory becomes @xmath14 after one has resummed the quark thermal mass @xmath15 ( if @xmath16 ) .",
    "the consequence of this regularization is that the resummed on - shell decay amplitude vanish in the chiral limit . in other words , pisarski s symmetry arguments holds for the physical amplitude only after a proper regularization ( in order to get rid of all potential infrared or collinear singularities ) has been issued .",
    "essential in this discussion is the influence of the kinematical conditions for the external legs on the infrared behavior of a thermal amplitude , since it can dramatically alter one s conclusions .",
    "the second important point is that a calculation in the imaginary time formalism at the static point does not give a physical amplitude .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to test the second half of pisarski s conclusions , related to the @xmath17 amplitude , by calculating this amplitude in the real time formalism and studying how it depends on the kinematics ( up to now , this amplitude has only be considered at the static point ) . since this amplitude",
    "is given by a four point function , it is a very complicated task to extract this behavior in its full generality .",
    "there is however a toy model in which this kind of study can be done quite simply : the 2-dimensional linear @xmath0 model .",
    "indeed , in this model the neutral pion decays into a single photon , and the analogous of the 4-point amplitude suggested by pisarski would be @xmath3 , which , being a 3-point function , is rather easy to calculate .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an analysis of the anomalous amplitudes in the 2-dimensional @xmath0 model at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we consider both the pion decay @xmath1 2-point function , and the @xmath3 3-point function .",
    "emphasis is put on studying how these functions depend on the kinematics in the limit of small external momenta , near the chiral limit ( @xmath11 small compared to @xmath18 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : notations ] defines the model , as well as some notations and shorthands that will be used extensively later . in section [ sec:2-point ]",
    ", we calculate the amplitude for the @xmath19 decay , and reduce it to a very compact form . in section [ sec:3-point ] , we study the amplitude of @xmath20 .",
    "although a priori much more involved , this amplitude can also be reduced to a simple expression .",
    "all our results are expressed in terms of some function @xmath21 defined by an integral .",
    "basic properties and limits of this function are derived in appendix [ app : i - integral ] .",
    "finally , appendix [ app : integrals - relations ] derives some relations between a few integrals that appear in intermediate stages of section [ sec:3-point ] .",
    "we consider the 2-dimensional linear @xmath0 model @xcite with two quark flavors , in which the mesons are coupled to quark fields as indicated by the following lagrangian : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we recall that in two dimensions the dirac algebra is defined by the following set of relations : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 2-dimensional levi - civita tensor , normalized by @xmath27 . for later use ,",
    "let us quote first a generic trace formula : @xmath28    in order to keep the following expressions compact , it is helpful to define the `` dual '' of a given vector by : @xmath29 as well as the `` wedge product '' of two vectors : @xmath30 according to these definitions , we have the obvious relations @xmath31 when @xmath32 , we have also : @xmath33 finally , we have @xmath34",
    "we consider first the 1-loop contribution to the @xmath19 decay amplitude depicted on figure [ fig:2point ] .     amplitude . ]",
    "the feynman rules for the retarded - advanced formalism in statistical weights where the feynman rules give an argument @xmath36 . in other words",
    ", @xmath18 appears in the formalism to account for the fact that the fermions carry some conserved charge , and the sign of this charge for a given propagator depends on how one orientates the propagator . ] @xcite give for the retarded amplitude the following expression @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the retarded and advanced propagators , @xmath39 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , and where the notation `` disc '' denotes the discontinuity across the real energy axis : @xmath40    the expression of the trace is very simple @xmath41 and in particular it makes obvious the fact that @xmath42 is transverse with respect to the photon momentum . moreover , being independent of the loop momentum @xmath43 , it can be immediately factorized out of the integral .      at this point , it is convenient to perform the change of variable @xmath44 on the second term of eq .",

    "@xmath46 where we denote @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is now trivial to perform an expansion in powers of the external momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the first term in this expansion , of degree @xmath50 in @xmath49 , vanish because the corresponding integrand is an odd function of @xmath51 .",
    "the first non vanishing term in this expansion comes at the next order , and is of degree @xmath52 in @xmath49 : @xmath53 where @xmath21 is an homogeneous function of degree @xmath50 in @xmath49 , containing the non trivial part of the momentum dependence , and defined by : @xmath54 this integral is studied in some important limits in the appendix [ app : i - integral ] .",
    "we observe for this amplitude the same features as in four dimensions .",
    "the most striking effect is related to what happens near the chiral limit @xmath2 , and is visible in formulas eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i - off - shell ] ) and ( [ eq : i - on - shell ] ) . in the limit @xmath55 , the function @xmath21 behaves as follows : @xmath56 the configuration obtained with @xmath57 and @xmath58 corresponds to salcedo s result , previously obtained in the imaginary time formalism at the static point .",
    "this point is particular because the first term in the expansion of @xmath21 at small @xmath11 vanishes if @xmath57 .",
    "for any other point , the expansion starts with a term behaving like @xmath59 .",
    "however , as one turns the chemical potential on , we see that this leading term is exponentially suppressed when @xmath60 . as a consequence , in a dense and cold system , the function @xmath21 starts by a term in @xmath61 , whether @xmath57 or not .",
    "the reason why the on - shell value is so singular when @xmath2 is related to collinear singularities : in @xmath62 dimensions , all the spatial vectors are aligned , so that we are always at the most singular point . here also , in order to be able to apply pisarski s argument , one should first regularize the theory by resumming a thermal mass@xcite .",
    "then , all the powers of @xmath11 in the denominators would be replaced by powers of the thermal mass , leaving an uncompensated power of @xmath63 in the numerator . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2point - final ] ) , we can write an effective lagrangian coupling the neutral pion to the photon : @xmath64 this result completes the effective coupling found by salcedo in @xcite , by incorporating all the nonlocal terms .",
    "the reason why the non - locality of this coupling has been missed in @xcite can be traced back in a misuse of the imaginary time techniques to get the zero momenta limit .",
    "we now consider the one - loop contribution to the @xmath20 amplitude , represented on figure [ fig:3point ] .     amplitude . ]    in the retarded - advanced formalism , the @xmath65 component of the vertex receives the following contribution from the first diagram : @xmath66 again , the expression becomes simpler if we perform the changes of variables @xmath67 on the second term , and @xmath68 on the third one .",
    "this enables one to have common statistical weight and discontinuity for the three terms , the tradeoff being that the trace becomes different for the three terms .",
    "we can apply the same manipulations to the contribution of the second diagram . with the additional change @xmath69 on the second diagram",
    ", we can merge the two contributions and find @xmath70 where the traces are given by @xmath71      we can now proceed with the expansion in powers of the external momenta .",
    "the first term in this expansion is of degree @xmath72 in the external momenta .",
    "an explicit calculation of this term shows that it vanishes thanks to energy - momentum conservation : @xmath73 .",
    "the next term , of degree @xmath50 in the external momenta , vanishes also because the corresponding integrand is an odd function of @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath78 where @xmath79 can be any of @xmath80 .",
    "the major difference compared to the case of the @xmath81 amplitude is that the above three - point amplitude is not manifestly transverse with respect to the photon momentum .",
    "the fact that the dirac s traces depend upon the loop momentum @xmath43 indicates that it could be necessary to calculate all the integrals before one can see the transversality .",

    "however , one can check that this is not the case , because the numerator behaves like @xmath91 when @xmath92 becomes small .",
    "we see that this 3-point amplitude involving the @xmath0 field depends on the same function @xmath93 defined above , and has one power of the mass @xmath11 less when compared to the @xmath94 amplitude , in agreement with the general arguments of @xcite .",
    "again , it is found that this limit depends on the kinematics , i.e. on the way one is approaching the zero momenta limit . in particular , the way this amplitude depends on @xmath11 at small @xmath11 depends strongly on the kinematics .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the result of @xcite , which only picked one particular limit . except at the static point ( @xmath95 ) , this amplitude becomes singular at the critical point where @xmath2 , indicating the necessity of regularizing the fermion propagator by a thermal mass . after this resummation has been performed",

    "the zero momenta limit is not unique and strongly depends on the kinematical configuration .",
    "in particular , the imaginary time formalism should be used with great care when looking at this limit .",
    "indeed , if one first sets the external discrete energies to zero , then all the information regarding the non - locality of the amplitude is lost , and in particular the physical limit can not be recovered .",
    "a proper way to use the imaginary time formalism would be to perform the sum over the loop discrete energies while keeping nonzero external discrete energies .",
    "after that , one should perform the analytical continuation to real external energies , and only then consider the zero momenta limit .",
    "the other conclusion of this work is that collinear or infrared singularities spoil the general symmetry arguments given in @xcite to justify the nullity of the pion decay into photons in the chirally symmetric phase : the _ on - shell _ decay amplitude in the bare theory does not vanish .",
    "for these arguments to be valid , one should perform the resummation of a thermal mass that will regularize the fermion propagators .",
    "if such a regularization is used , then the conclusion is that @xmath1 vanishes when @xmath2 , while @xmath3 does not , in agreement with the conjecture of @xcite .",

    "a first check is to look at the zero temperature and chemical potential limit of this function , which gives immediately @xmath98 as one could expect , this @xmath99 limit does not exhibit any non - locality in its momentum dependence , since this is a purely thermal feature .",
