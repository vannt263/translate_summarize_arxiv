    "the particle production in heavy ion collisions was well represented by the fireball model [ 1 ] at medium energy range , where the concept of global equilibrium may be accepted .",
    "the fireball model was developed to fit experimental data at higher energies .",
    "a local equilibrium was assumed in the so called fire - streak model [ 2,3 ] that treats the variation across the overlap region of the target and projectile in the amount of energy and momentum that it deposited .",
    "the expression for calculating any observable takes the form of a sum over a series of terms , each one of which concerns to a local equilibrium and consists of a geometric , kinematics and statistical factors . as the energy increases more , it is expected that collision time becomes small enough so that particle emitted in the early stage of the reaction possesses non - equilibrium characteristics .",
    "the density function in phase space should be treated on the time scale to follow up the time grow of the reaction .",
    "many trials have been done in this concern .",
    "the equation of motion can be reformulated to give it the appearance of classical equation for the phase distribution function . in this approximation ,",
    "a local one body potential can be defined and the phase distribution function may contain the same information as the one body density matrix .",
    "this is the hartree - fock approximation [ 4 ] .",
    "the many body physics enters only through the relation of the potential and the density .",
    "one more approximation reduces the equation to completely a classical form is to make a power series expansion of the one body potential and get the so called vlasov equation [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "a situation that can be analyzed with the vlasov equation is the short time behaviour of the system subjected to an impulsive force .",
    "if the potential is sufficiently weak , the solution of the excited system may be treated by the quantum mechanical sum rules introduce first by fallieros [ 8 ] and noble [ 9 ] .",
    "while it is not possible to integrate the vlasov equation in general , some insight may be given by expanding the solution for small intervals of time .",
    "the starting point is the equilibrium solution , which is perturbed by the impulsive potential .",
    "another treatment of the vlasov equation depends on the theory of small oscillations in finite system [ 10 ] .",
    "a closed expression has the appearance of rayleighs variation principle with a certain explicit form for the potential energy function .",
    "the solution is represented in the form of a sum of an equilibrium function plus a time dependent one which is assumed small compared with the first .",
    "the motion is assumed to have a sinusoidal time dependence with frequency .",
    "the variational principle was applied to estimate the frequencies of nuclear vibrations of various multi - polarity . in this work",
    "a method is developed to solve the vlasov equation with reasonable approximations in a frame of a time dependent thermodynamic model , which enables the calculation of light and heavy particle spectra on the different reaction stages .",
    "the details of the model are presented in section 2 .",
    "results and discussion are displayed in section 3 , and finally in section 4 , we present conclusive remarks .",
    "let us consider the collision between a target nucleus t and a projectile one p at a given impact parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the collision goes through sequential stages .",
    "the first is a compression of the nuclear matter due to the high energy interaction , forming a fireball with diffuseness surface on the contrary of the fireball model assumptions [ 1 ] which support the concept of the participant and spectator nucleons with pure cylindrical cut in the nuclear matter .",
    "the nuclear matter is then treated as a heterogeneous thermodynamic system .",
    "multiple nuclear collisions run inside the fireball which increases the energy density and allows the formation of quark gluon plasma state[11 - 14 ] .",
    "this leads to the creation of new particles and expansion of the system which gradually approaches the equilibrium state .",
    "the last stage is the fireball decay .",
    "particle emission from the fireball is allowed at different points on the time scale of the reaction .",
    "light created particles are expected to be emitted on the early stage at narrow forward cone angle , i.e. due to the first few collisions .",
    "the higher order collisions draw the system towards the equilibrium state producing particles in isotropic distribution in phase space .",
    "it is then convenient to consider the state of equilibrium as a time reference of the reaction .",
    "drawing back , we may follow the historical grow of particle emissions on the time scale .",
    "hadronic matter inside the fireball is partially formed by the fast projectile nucleons and the slow target ones .",
    "the relative projectile density in this mixture is a very important parameter .",
    "it determines the fireball parameters , the center of mass velocity , the temperature and the temperature gradient inside the fireball matter .",
    "we use a gaussian density distribution [ 15 ] for nuclei of mass number @xmath1 , while a fermi density for @xmath2 . consider a frame of reference coincides with the center of the target nucleus in the lab . system , then the relative projectile density @xmath3 , at a given distance @xmath4 inside the fireball matter and a given impact parameter b ,",

    "the temperature is very sensitive to the form of the nuclear density .",

    "the vlasov eq . has the form ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a scalar potential acting among the particles .",
    "eq.(9 ) may be solved under some approximations .",
    "first , we shall consider a pre - equilibrium state where the time derivative @xmath21 may be approximated as @xmath22 .",
    "where @xmath23 is the equilibrium distribution . since we are dealing with a state near equilibrium ,",
    "so it is convenient to consider that the rate of change of the function f is approximately equal to that of @xmath24 .",
    "so we replace @xmath25 by @xmath23 in the rhs of eq.(9 ) .",
    "moreover , let us consider the particles as almost free so that we neglect the potential @xmath26 in this stage of approximation .",
    "eq.(9 ) then becomes , @xmath27    @xmath28 @xmath29 is the first order approximation of the particle spectrum , @xmath30 is the time interval required by the system to approach the equilibrium state @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the scattering angle , the angle between the direction of particle emission @xmath33 and the radial direction @xmath34 .",
    "a second order approximation is obtained by using @xmath29 instead of @xmath25 in the rhs of eq.(9 ) , so that,@xmath35@xmath36 by the same analogy we get the recursion relation for the @xmath37 order approximation as ;    @xmath38 so that the third and fourth order approximations are ;    @xmath39    @xmath40",
    "the predictions of the pre equilibrium model are applied to the ne - u collisions at 400 and 2100 a mev . assuming a frame of reference coincide with the center of the target , and that the projectile is located at a position @xmath9 , with an impact parameter @xmath0 as shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the relative projectile density @xmath3 is calculated according to eq.(1 ) . in fig.(2 ) we demonstrate @xmath41 averaged over the whole range of impact parameter .",
    "the function @xmath42 shows a peak value of a height   0.5 at a distance  @xmath43 , where the projectile and the target have equal densities .",
    "according to the model assumptions , the nuclei have no sharp surface density but instead , a diffuseness surface which extends the range of the nuclear matter to about twice the sum of the nuclear radii . on the other hand",
    "the geometrical factor represented by the size of the nuclear matter has heavy weight near the origin and falls exponentially with @xmath34 toward the surface as may be described by the tail of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the effective range , where the nuclear matter forming the nuclear thermodynamic system has appreciable value is estimated to about @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 has a main role in evaluating the temperature and its gradient inside the nuclear matter as seen by eq.(4 ) .",
    "fig.(3 ) shows the temperature as a function of @xmath46 for the reactions at 400 and 2100 mev incident kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "the maximum temperature is found to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 respectively",
    ". the proton density function in its equilibrium form is calculated according to eq.(6 ) over the effective range of the thermodynamic system .",
    "the results are shown in fig.(4 ) for protons emitted with @xmath50 and @xmath51 with emission lab angle @xmath52 . the protons produced at low energy show anisotropic distribution with peaks near the origin and the surface of the thermodynamic system .",
    "the position of the two peaks correspond to the regions characterized by low @xmath46 values and consequently low temperature .",
    "high energy emission @xmath53 shows plateau shape density distribution .",
    "the bulk of which corresponds to high temperature zones .",
    "the yield from the low temperature zones decreases with increasing the energy of the emitted protons .",
    "the spatial variation of the function @xmath54 is also studied .",
    "fig.(5 ) exhibit the nth order derivative of @xmath23 .",
    "maximum variation of the derivatives occurs at the origin and near the surface where the temperature and its gradient also change rapidly .",
    "the solution of the vlasov equation is calculated to the fourth order approximation as clarified by eq.(8 ) .",
    "the result is integrated over the effective range with a geometrical weight factor @xmath55 , depends on the size of the nuclear matter .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry of the system then one can finally find the lab energy spectra , which is calculated at specific values of emission angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58    figs(6 - 11 ) shows the lab energy spectra of protons produced in ne - u at 400 a mev corrected to the second order .",
    "the prediction of the model is compared to the zero order correction ( the equilibrium distribution ) as well as the experimental data .",
    "the emission time parameter is found by fitting method to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 corresponding to the emission angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "a global fair agreement is obtained by the second order corrected solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "an appreciable improvement is observed in the prediction of the model , particularly in the forward emission spectra ( @xmath32 = 30 and 60@xmath61 ) .",
    "the prediction of the model comes closer to the equilibrium distribution for the wide emission angles ( @xmath32 = 90 , 120 and 150@xmath61 ) .",
    "particle produced at this wide angles are expected to make multiple collisions inside the nuclear matter before emission takes place . in other words ,",
    "the wide angle production is a signal to the approach to the equilibrium state .",
    "such a system is characterized by large number of inter - nuclear cascade collisions which increases the entropy of the system and leads to equilibrium .",
    "it is found that the solution of the vlasov equation through the present approximation forms a converging series .",
    "it is enough to consider only the first two terms in the series on dealing with the ne - u collisions at 400 a mev . while terms up to the fourth order are found to have appreciable values for the case of ne - u collisions at 2100 a mev .",
    "the second correction and the fourth order correction improve the calculation toward the virtual values .",
    "although we considered four terms for the reaction at 2100 mev , but the agreement with experimental data was not fair enough .",
    "the hypothesis of pre - equilibrium includes many approximations that may not fit the systems formed at high energies .",
    "the last term in vlasov equation containing the field potential between the interacting particles should be considered , and the problem then is treated microscopically instead of the macroscopic picture as presented in this article . despite of the existence of the field theory of strong interactions ,",
    "the theoretical description of this phenomena is necessarily phenomenological because of the very nature of the problem which involves many degrees of freedom . in a forthcoming article",
    ", one may encounter the problem taking into consideration the study of collective properties of hadronic matter , in particular its possible phase transition to the quark - gluon phase .",
    "the main merits of this approach lie , in our view , in the fact that the phenomenology is reduced to microscopic concepts like parton- parton cross sections and structure function and different equilibrium properties of the gluon and quark components of hadrons which allow for identification of the coherent parts of the interactions .",
    "i- the pre - equilibrium model with reasonable approximations may fit the experimental data of heavy ion collisions within the regime of few hundreds a mev . in this case ,",
    "a power series is presented to describe the nuclear density function in the frame of a thermodynamic picture .",
    "iv- the temperature has minimum values around the center and near the end of the effective range of the nuclear matter .",
    "these regions are responsible of the emission of low energy particles , while fast particles are produced in the bulk region characterized by @xmath62and high temperature .",
    "vii- particles emitted in the forward direction are produced in the early stage of the reaction , far from the equilibrium .",
    "backward production comes in a later stage when the system constituents undergo multiple cascade collisions .                                          1",
