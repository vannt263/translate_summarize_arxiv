    "supernova explosions are among the most violent and spectacular phenomena in our universe [ for reviews , see , e.g. @xcite and references therein , or see the talk by sumiyoshi on this workshop @xcite ] . in later stage of the evolution of massive stars , thermal - nuclear fusions which power the stars stop at the formation of irons , the most stable nuclei .",
    "the collapse takes place when the pressure can not sustain gravitational forces due to drop of temperature .",
    "compact stars or sometime called neutron stars are one possible product of such a collapse . just before collapse",
    "the fraction of protons reach the level of the most neutron - rich terrestrial matter , about 0.4 , much larger than that in nuclear matter in neutron stars .",
    "therefore the electron capture process @xmath1 can occur during the collapse because the fermi surface of protons is high enough to open up phase space . during the explosion the total energy released in neutrino bursts can reach as much as 20% of the solar mass . after the explosion",
    ", the proton abundance falls to the lower level characteristic of a compact star .",
    "the temperature of the newborn compact star exceeds some tens of mev @xcite .",
    "the compact star cools down mainly by neutrino emissions in its earlier age and gamma - ray emissions when it gets very old [ for reviews of neutron star cooling , see , e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "the baryon density in the core of a compact star is likely to reach several times the nuclear saturation density , @xmath2 or @xmath3 . at such a high density",
    ", nucleons in nuclear matter are crushed into their constituents , i.e. quarks and gluons .",
    "this deconfinement transition to quark matter was suggested by collins and perry already in 1975 @xcite based on the asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics . in the same paper they also mentioned the possibility that quark matter could be a superfluid or a superconductor resulting from the attractive inter - quark force in some channels .",
    "barrois , bailin and love developed this novel idea and studied the unusual variant of superconductivity in quark matter , which we now call color superconductivity ( csc ) @xcite .",
    "they did their calculations in the framework of weak coupling approach and did not take into account the dynamic screening of magnetic gluons which are dominant agents in pairing quarks .",
    "therefore the gap or equivalently the transition temperature they obtained are too small to be of relevance to any sizable observables .",
    "about fifteen years later the color superconductivity had been re - discovered by several groups who found the gap could be large enough to bring some real effects in compact stars @xcite .",
    "[ for recent reviews on color superconductivity , see , for example , @xcite . also see zhuang s talk on this workshop based on ref . @xcite .",
    "]    considering that neutrino emissions are main source of cooling for young compact stars and that the star core is very likely to be csc quark matter , it is important to study neutrino emissions in a csc and how they influence the thermal history of the stars .",
    "it is well known that the most efficient or fast cooling processes in quark matter of normal state are the direct urca processes , less efficient are the modified urca and bremsstrahlung processes or slow processes .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : main - neutrino ] .",
    "the direct urca in color superconducting quark matter was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a csc , besides these neutrino processes , there are other neutrino sources such as decays of goldstone modes in the color - flavor - locked phase @xcite or in particular kaon condensed phase of color flavor locked phase @xcite . in this paper , we will briefly address several issues about direct urca processes .",

    "the name of urca was coined by gamow and schoenberg when they studied the star cooling mechanism by neutrino emissions @xcite .",
    "as gamow commemorated , the name actually came from a casino in rio de janeiro considering that urca processes accounting for rapid energy loss in stars is just like the casino s exhausting money from gamblers pockets @xcite .",
    "later they gave urca a physical meaning , i.e. the abbreviation of _ unrecordable cooling agent_.    in nuclear matter , the proton abundance is crucial to phase space for urca processes to proceed . in normal state",
    "quark matter , the abundance of @xmath0 quarks plays an equal role .",
    "suppose there are only light quarks and electrons in the system and they are ultra - relativistic at high baryon densities .",
    "let us estimate the fraction of @xmath0 quarks from the electric charge neutrality and @xmath4 equilibrium condition , @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number density , chemical potential and fermi momentum for particle @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 equilibrium condition means that it costs no energy to convert a @xmath0 quark and an electron to a @xmath10 quark and vice versa . in @xmath4 equilibrium",
    "the abundances of quarks and electrons are stable and do not change with time .",
    "the chemical potential is just the fermi energy , so in @xmath4 equilibrium and at zero temperature there is no phase space for urca processes because participating particles on their respective fermi surfaces do not satisfy energy conservation . at non - zero temperatures , quarks and electrons",
    "can be excited above their fermi surfaces of order @xmath11 , energy conservation for urca processes can be reached in a small range .",
    "the third condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase - neutrality ] ) is the triangle relation among fermi momenta of light quarks and electrons .",
    "we know that at low temperature momenta of participants are close to their fermi surfaces .",
    "so in order to satisfy momentum conservation @xmath12(the neutrino momentum is negligible ) , three momenta form a triangle in a plane , so the length of each side should be be less than the sum of lengths of other twos .",
    "rewriting the electric neutrality condition as @xmath13 where the number densities are given by @xmath14 for quarks and @xmath15 for electrons . applying the triangle relation , we have @xmath16 in terms of the ratio @xmath17 , the above inequality becomes @xmath18 which leads to @xmath19 from the @xmath4 equilibrium condition in ( [ eq : phase - neutrality ] ) and the inequality ( [ eq : pfupfd ] ) , we obtain@xmath20 the above inequality means the fermi momentum of electrons must be less than 20% of that of @xmath10 quarks . following ( [ eq : pfupfd ] ) , the fraction of @xmath0 quarks then satisfies the inequality @xmath21 hence the fraction of @xmath0 quarks must exceed @xmath22 for urca processes to proceed . the factor @xmath22 comes naturally if the electron density is neglected .",
    "in ultra - relativistic case , the @xmath4 equilibrium condition is not compatible with the triangle relation in ( [ eq : phase - neutrality ] ) since the former requires that @xmath23 .",
    "this means phase space for neutrino emissions is zero for direct urca .",
    "if the quark - quark interaction is switched on , fermi momenta are not equal to chemical potentials any more , instead they get negative corrections from landau fermi liquid property @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath27 with the number of colors @xmath28 .",
    "the reduction in fermi momentum means a non - zero effective mass on the fermi surface .",
    "this opens up phase space characterized by the triangle inequality @xmath29 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cap : phasespace ] , two dashed circles denote the fermi surfaces for free @xmath10 and @xmath0 quarks .",
    "they shrink to two smaller solid circles after the interaction is turned on .",
    "the amount of reduction in fermi momentum for @xmath10 quarks is larger than that for @xmath0 quarks , then there is a triangle among fermi momenta implying non - vanishing phase space .",
    "the corrections proportional to @xmath30 is from the quark - quark forward scattering via one gluon exchange with zero quark mass .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we re - analyzed phase space for du processes by deriving @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 in qcd with non - zero quark masses and some other features not considered in ref .",
    "we also carry out the same task in the njl model .",
    "when @xmath26 and @xmath33 are small , @xmath33 as a function @xmath32 can be solved , @xmath34\\frac{\\mu_{0}^{2}}{\\mu^{2}}+\\frac{c_{f}\\alpha_{s}}{2\\pi},\\label{eq : kappa - qcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one sees that if @xmath35 at @xmath36 , then @xmath37 is always true for any values of @xmath32 .",
    "this is the physical branch , the other one corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "a similar result can also be found in njl model , @xmath39\\frac{\\mu_{0}^{2}}{\\mu^{2}}+\\frac{4g_{s}\\mu^{2}}{3\\pi^{2}},\\label{eq : kappa0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the coupling constant for the scalar and pseudoscalar channels in njl model . as in the qcd case , @xmath41 is the physical solution .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa - qcd ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa0 ] ) , both physical solutions show that the fermi momentum reduction coefficient @xmath33 are monotonously increasing functions of the chemical potential .",
    "such a trend implies that phase space for neutrino emissions is quenched at lower baryon densities .",
    "the property seems robust and independent of specific models in computing the landau coefficients .",
    "phase space for du processes with massless quarks ]",
    "in calculating the neutrino emissivity in urca processes , it is convenient to use the fermi effective model of weak interaction since the characteristic energy scale is about a few hundred mev , much less than the w - boson mass .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of the model is @xmath42 where the weak current is @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here",
    "the flavor matrices @xmath46 are defined by @xmath47 the matrix elements for urca processes amount to calculating @xmath48 , \\label{eq:4-fermion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have only kept terms relevant to direct urca . by renaming indices @xmath49 in the second term , one can prove that the second is identical to the first .",
    "these terms correspond to two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ cap : diagrams ] in the quark tensor , so we get a factor of 2 , which we took into account in eq .",

    "( [ eq:4-fermion ] ) .",
    "the dashed lines denote w - bosons . ]",
    "the flavor sector of neutrino emissivity in csc is more complicated than that in the normal phase because of pairings in flavor space .",
    "nambu - gorkov ( ng ) basis is a convenient mathematical tool to describe pairings .",
    "we have to write down the quark - quark - w - boson vertices in ng basis . to this end , we enlarge the spinor space by introducing a couplet field consisting of a quark field and its charge conjugate partner , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the charge conjugate operator . here",
    "we suppress the quark index @xmath52 in quark fields .",
    "now we rewrite the bilinear term @xmath53 in the weak current in eq .",

    "therefore the weak vertex in ng basis is , @xmath57        where the trace is over ng , color , flavor and dirac indices .",

    "[ cap : flavor - trace ] for the flavor trace , one can easily verify that for single flavor or spin - one pairings @xcite off - diagonal parts are absent , but it is not the case for spin - zero pairings such as the color - flavor - locked phase [ see , e.g. ref .",
