    "the last few years witnessed the emergence of a new channel of human communication in the world wide web .",
    "this is called _ social networking sites _ ( sns ) .",
    "an sns provides an arena on the internet , where millions of people are creating personal pages , featuring profiles , photos , music , movies , daily records etc . , and at a same time , they are watching activities of others and occasionally responding to some of them",
    ". people frequently have communication with each other by sending messages , during chats on same subjects , in on - line communities or groups of people with similar interests , and thus grow up friendship .",
    "an early example is friendster for which a million people , in a single quarter of 2003 , had registered .",
    "myspace attracted more than a hundred million people in the end of 2006 , which ranks fifth among all the internet access to every www sites .",
    "other sites include orkut with 36 million accounts , 65% in brazil , cyworld , 18 million mostly in korea , and facebook , more than 13 million , 85% students in usa ( the numbers are so recorded at the time of writing ) .",
    "we believe that the present reader has experience in one sns or more , and that it is not disputable that these sites provide _ societies _ on the internet , which form giant human networks .",
    "this fact that recently an increasing amount of social interactions are recorded electronically can boost the understanding of the structural formation of human networks in a society - wide scale , which had never been accessible .",
    "indeed , traditional social network studies ( see @xcite for review ) usually carry out collection of data by querying people using questionnaires or interviews .",
    "such methods have been limiting the size of the network under study .",
    "additionally , survey data are often relying on individual s memory even to list up friends .",
    "researchers can now access to social networks of much larger scale and of different nature .",
    "see the studies on e - mail @xcite , phone calls @xcite , for example , in this new direction .    there are some works on social networks on the internet .",
    "sociologists have attempted to measure how the internet and the web services have effect on real - life social interactions .",
    "such effect is present in occasions of `` off - line '' social events and `` on - line '' communities as integrated patterns of social life ( see wellman s viewpoint @xcite on this matter ) .",
    "holme  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite investigated a dating site .",
    "it should be mentioned that a dating site has different characteristics in the network structure , because the incentives of participants in forming ties are relatively limited .",
    "actually , clustering coefficients are much lower than those in many sns .",
    "adamic  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite studied a social networking site at a university , which includes analysis of friendship , called buddy , in relation to the attributes and personalities of the users .",
    "backstrom  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite investigated group formation in an sns , livejournal , and a dataset of academic collaboration .",
    "they focus on how on - line communities and interaction therein affect group formation and network structure .",
    "it is remarked that in this paper , we shall reserve the word , `` community '' , to mean a tightly - knit group of people in a linkage property , and distinguish it from `` on - line community '' , an on - line group of people who have similar interests but are not necessarily linked with each other .",
    "see also the recent work @xcite on messages exchanged by users in facebook .    in this paper",
    ", we study a friendship network recorded at the largest sns in a country , which comprises more than third million people and nearly two million links .",
    "each link is a mutually acknowledged friendship .",
    "our main concern here is the community structure in the network  how people cluster into tightly - knit groups with relatively high density , and how bunches of these groups are embedded in the entire network . to uncover the structure of the giant network of people ,",
    "we employ a community - extracting method @xcite .    in section  [ sec : sns ]",
    ", we describe the sns , activities of users in it , and the definition of link , namely friendship in the network . in section  [ sec :",
    "stat ] , we examine the structure of the friendship network .",
    "in particular , we show that the network has a scale - free degree distribution in its tail , high transitivity , and positive degree - degree correlation , as observed in many social networks . in section",
    "[ sec : commun ] , however , we found a novel feature in the distribution of community - sizes that there is a gap in the community - sizes such that only few communities are extracted . in section",
    "[ sec : cnnr ] , we propose a simple model with connecting nearest neighbors and random linkage , and show that it can explain the gap as well as the other statistical properties .",
    "the largest sns in japan , as of december 2006 , is mixi , which had started with a small group in march 2004 and has been rapidly growing , a million accounts in august 2005 , 6.6 million in november 2006 .",
    "our dataset , as of march 2005 , is consisted of third million accounts , nearly two million links of on - line friendship , and about a million on - line communities .",
    "individuals in all these data are encrypted for privacy protection .",
    "the number of users is roughly 10% of all the domestic people who have access to the internet , from teenagers to adults , equally males and females , including workers and non - workers .",
    "mobile - phone users have access at any location and time . at this epoch ,",
    "the number was growing as a power function of physical time with exponent 2 to 2.6 , which implies that the rate of growth was proportional to the user - number to the power 0.5 to 0.6 . since the start",
    ", it has been reported that about 70% of the accounts visit the sites at least once in three days week by week .",
    "indeed , according to a survey , the mixi is the third most active sns ( myspace and orkut are the top two ) in terms of access from users , matching facebook at activity .",
    "activities of the users are summarized as follows .",
    "a new person participates in the site , provided that an already registered user invites him or her who accepts the invitation .",
    "otherwise the site is not public to the internet and is accessible only for the registered users .",
    "this policy of publicity , which is taken by other sns such as orkut , endows the site with a feature differing from blogs and bulletin board systems in the www .",
    "while some sns have different policies about publicity , it is said that the users feel less fear and anxiety about personal abuse and , actually , many users are observed to name themselves as they do in real life , rather than anonymously .",
    "this is presumably due to the invitation scheme , being invited by a person , an acquaintance , to find oneself within many acquaintances .",
    "many people consider that this is a less uneasy environment to start with .    after the registration ,",
    "the users make their own profiles , write diaries with varying frequencies , to which others make recommendations and comments . like other sns",
    ", they are able to see logs of visitors and to send and receive messages to anyone .",
    "the profiles and diaries are selectively public either to friends , to friends of friends , or to all in the sns .    on - line communities",
    "are another design for promoting communication , each with participants having shared interests and chats on same subjects . a new on - line",
    "community is launched by an arbitrary user as administrator , who sets its publicity either to participants or to the entire sns .",
    "one can search particular persons and on - line communities in the whole site by keywords and classified categories .    through exchange of multiple information , from diaries to on - line communities , one gets to know who has similar interests as his or hers , and eventually become _ friends _ by mutual acknowledgement , which is done by sending messages .",
    "this is the links and friendship network which we study in this paper .",
    "one s friends are listed in thumbnails at the top page of the user .",
    "note that the devices of diaries , footprints , lists of friends and on - line communities foster growth of friendship collectively and in different ways .",
    "even if a new comer starts with a single link , he or she will quickly find acquaintances at one or two steps in friends of friends , then sometimes gets acquainted with more people noticed from footprints or by search deep in the site .",
    "the number of user accounts and links of friendships are respectively , 363,819 and 1,906,878 , in our dataset . in average",
    ", one has about ten friends",
    ". we shall examine more statistical properties in the next section .",
    "people can be disconnected , because links are possible to be lost by unregistration of users or by refusal of the corresponding friendship .",
    "however , we found that most people are connected with each other .",
    "the largest connected component , in fact , contains 360,802 people , 99.2% of all the users . the rest",
    "is composed of 1,213 disconnected components , most of which are tiny groups each of a few people .",
    "we examine the largest component in the following . denoting the numbers of nodes and links by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we use the words , participant and vertex , interchangeably below .",
    "shortest - path lengths averaged over all pairs of vertices is given by @xmath4 .",
    "the longest shortest - path has length @xmath5 , called diameter of the network .",
    "the number of links , or degree , have a long - tail distribution .",
    "the degree distribution is denoted by @xmath6 , i.e. the fraction of vertices in the network with degree @xmath7 .",
    "cumulative degree distribution is given by @xmath8 .",
    "we plot @xmath9 in fig .  [",
    "fig : stat ]  ( a ) .",
    "the maximum degree is @xmath10 .",
    "there are a small number of hubs , about 100 people with links exceeding 300 , even 3 persons with degree 1000 or more .",
    "the time corresponding to the acquisition of the data coincides when the site forbids participants to create more than 1,000 links per each .",
    "this rule , however , did not essentially impose a threshold in the degree studied here , as we have checked in historical information of the site . on the other hand , 83,525 people ( 23% )",
    "have a single link , mostly new comers linked only to those who invited ; 182,125 people ( 50% ) have less than 5 links .",
    "the first two moments of degree are @xmath11 the tail of degree distribution follows a power - law @xmath12 .",
    "the exponent was estimated in the region of @xmath7 greater than 60 by the conventional mean - square - error in logarithmic variables , and is given by @xmath13 , although the exponent here , and the other ones given below , should be understood simply as rough estimates .      in many social networks ,",
    "the friend of one s friend is quite likely also to be the one s friend .",
    "transitivity means how high the number of triangles is present in the network ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "global clustering coefficient is defined by @xmath14 where a connected triple means a pair of vertices that are connected to another node .",
    "@xmath15 is the mean probability that two persons who have a common friend are also friends of each other .",
    "our dataset gives the value @xmath16    to compare this with a class of random graphs which have the same size and degree distribution , one can use the expected value of global clustering coefficient given by @xcite @xmath17 ^ 2    \\ .",

    "( for the class of poisson random graphs , ( [ random_cg ] ) reduces to @xmath19 , which is @xmath20 . )",
    "the observed value ( [ cg ] ) clearly shows strong cliquishness in the local structure .",
    "people choose new acquaintances who are friends of friends , well known as triadic closure .",
    "local clustering coefficient is a related and distinct measure of cliquishness . for each vertex @xmath21 , define @xmath22 the denominator is equal to @xmath23 for the degree @xmath24 of the vertex @xmath21 . for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 by convention .",
    "the averaged clustering coefficient is then defined by @xmath28 .",
    "our dataset gives the value , @xmath29 .",
    "local clustering coefficient @xmath30 has a strong dependence on the degree @xmath24 . to quantify it",
    ", one usually defines @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ]  ( b ) , we plot the correlation between degree @xmath7 and @xmath32 .",
    "we observe that @xmath32 decreases as @xmath33 for the range @xmath34 .",
    "this differs from many other networks , where @xmath35 gives a fit as reported @xcite .",
    "are people with high - degrees preferentially linked to those of high - degrees or low - degrees ? to see the assortative mixing with respect to degree @xcite , or degree correlation , one often calculates the averaged nearest - neighbor degree @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the probability that a randomly chosen edge has a vertex with degree @xmath38 at either end , while at the other end with degree @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig : stat ]  ( c ) shows @xmath39 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "we can observe that in the range @xmath40 there is a positive correlation .",
    "nevertheless , the positive correlation does not extend to the region @xmath41 , where it is slightly negative instead .",
    "this fact can be interpreted in the way that hubs with high - degrees , say a few hundreds , have propensity to acknowledge a proposed friendship from anyone who is necessarily in the majority of lower - degrees .",
    "vertices with degrees of dozens , on the other hand , tend to form assortative mixing among them as the region of positive correlation implies .",
    "the negative correlation in extremely low - degree @xmath42 is due to the new comers just invited .",
    "related quantity is the degree - degree correlation , which is the pearson correlation coefficient for degrees of vertices @xmath43 at either end of a link @xmath44 .",
    "that is @xcite , @xmath45 ^ 2}{m^{-1 }    \\sum_a\\frac{1}{2}(j_a^2+k_a^2 )    -\\left[m^{-1}\\sum_a\\frac{1}{2}(j_a+k_a)\\right]^2 } \\ .\\ ] ] we obtain the value @xmath46 , where the standard error was calculated by the method in @xcite . in terms of this single measure",
    ", the correlation coefficient shows a statistical significance of positive correlation .      social interaction between two non - neighboring persons might depend on another who is on the paths between the first two .",
    "a vertex with relatively low - degree can possibly play an intermediary role in the flow and diffusion of information .",
    "betweenness centrality @xcite of vertex @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of shortest - paths between a pair of vertices @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the number of such paths that go through @xmath47 .",
    "the factor of @xmath53 takes into account the fact all shortest - paths are visited twice .",
    "the distribution @xmath54 for @xmath55 is depicted in the _ cumulative _ form , @xmath56 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ]  ( d ) .",
    "similar results were obtained in other networks , especially the power - law tail @xcite . in our case , we have @xmath57 in the upper - tail regime .        while the vertices with higher - degrees tend to have higher betweenness centralities , it is important to see that vertices with relatively low - degrees have also high betweenness values .",
    "we draw the scatter - plot for the pair of @xmath7 and @xmath58 of vertices in fig .  [",
    "fig : deg - bet ] .",
    "while there is obviously positive correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath58 , we notice that a same high value of @xmath58 , e.g. @xmath59@xmath60 in the center of the figure , is produced by vertices with a wide range of @xmath7 , @xmath61",
    ". those vertices may be connectors between tightly - knit groups of people , and can provide bridge in the process of acquaintance along friendship .",
    "think of your friend s friend who is not your friend .",
    "however little you know about him or her , you might have experienced that your friend introduced the person to you and that you find that such a person eventually brings you some new or useful information .",
    "the circle of friends of friends forms a `` horizon '' beyond which you reach to new people and information .",
    "thus the number of one s friends of friends gives the size of the horizon .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] shows , from a single and typical person , the numbers of people who are at distance of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , and the accumulated numbers at each distance . within the distance of six - degree",
    "are 96.1% of people .        in particular ,",
    "because of the long - tail distribution of degree , the number of friends of friends is larger than one can naively expect as @xmath64 from the average degree @xmath65",
    ". it may be interesting to compare the average number of friends of friends in the sns , denoted by @xmath66 , with the value given theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the actual value is @xmath67 , while @xmath64 gives 111.5 , small by factor of three .",
    "the approximate estimation of @xmath66 with non - vanishing @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 , which gives the value 424.0 .",
    "this is approximation assuming there is no `` squares '' , the case that you know two people who have another friend in common , but whom you personally do not know .",
    "in a further approximation followed from the assumption that such squares are composed of triangles , one has the estimate @xmath70 , where @xmath71}\\right\\rangle}/{\\left\\langle{k}\\right\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "this gives the value 299.4 , within 3% of the actual value .",
    "one feature among the properties of networks which has attracted much interest is the property of community structure ( see @xcite for example and @xcite for review ) .",
    "detection of community structure is to find how vertices in the network cluster into tightly - knit groups with high density in intra - groups and with lower connectivity in inter - groups . without _ a priori knowledge _ of how vertices with similar attributes are assortatively linked to each other ,",
    "the community detection would be based solely on the structure of links .",
    "we use a community - extracting algorithm based on the idea of modularity introduced by newman @xcite .",
    "we employ the implementation developed by clauset _",
    "et  al._@xcite , which has made a community - extraction feasible in a practical computational time for giant networks with millions of vertices ( see @xcite for related but different girvan - newman algorithm which is based on edge - betweenness ) .",
    "let us call the employed algorithm as the cnm algorithm and the extracted communities as newman communities ( ncs ) .",
    "let @xmath72 be the fraction of edges in the network that connect vertices in group @xmath21 to those in group @xmath73 , and let @xmath74 .",
    "then modularity @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76 which is the fraction of edges that fall within groups , minus the expected value of the fraction under the hypothesis that edges fall randomly irrespectively of the community structure .",
    "detection of community structure is then formulated as an optimization problem to find a devision of @xmath77 vertices into mutually disjoint groups such that the corresponding value of @xmath75 is maximum .",
    "the algorithm@xcite is a greedy optimization algorithm of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering .",
    "the implementation given in @xcite , when applied to sparse and modular networks , runs in essentially linear time @xmath78 .    in each step of",
    "the algorithm involves calculating @xmath79 that would result from the amalgamation of each pair of groups @xmath21 and @xmath73 , choosing the largest of the changes , and doing the corresponding amalgamation . because different pairs can give a same amount of largest change @xmath80 , choice of a particular pair would alter the subsequent process of amalgamations , resulting in different community structures as local maxima .",
    "the output of the algorithm gives the following results .",
    "the maximum modularity is @xmath81 , which is considered to be high and to indicate strong community structure@xcite . resulting structure includes 3,956 communities .",
    "we performed a coarse - graining visualization by drawing the graph of communities in a physical model which consists of attractive force between connected pairs of communities and repulsive force between unconnected pairs .",
    "[ fig : commun ]  ( a ) is the visualization , which shows a few large communities , small - sized numerous communities connected to them , and medium - sized communities ( depicted as a bunch of densely connected balls in the upper - left portion of the figure ) , that are connected mutually as well as to the large ones . here",
    "size refers to the number of vertices contained in each community , and is depicted as each ball - size in log scale .",
    "colors of balls are randomly assigned for the purpose of visibility .",
    "the distribution of community - sizes uncovers a novel structure hidden in the network .",
    "[ fig : commun ]  ( b ) shows the plot for the community - size and the rank of the size . in the lower rank corresponding to the size up to 20 ,",
    "there are numerous small - sized communities , 3,873 in the number , with 220 people in each . in the intermediate range of the size between 20 and 400",
    ", we found a gap where few communities are extracted .",
    "up to the size of 4000 , there are 80 medium - sized communities with hundreds to thousands people in each community .",
    "then in the very end of the tail , one sees four largest communities , whose presence is quite similar to other results of the cnm algorithm applied for giant networks ( see @xcite for example , and also fig .",
    "[ fig : commun_diff ]  ( g ) ) .",
    "since the algorithm is a greedy optimization as remarked above , one should check different locally optimal solutions of community structures .",
    "we did so by randomly shuffling the stored order of edge - lists without changing the network structure , thus effectively altered the order of amalgamation during the agglomerative clustering .",
    "[ fig : commun ]  ( c ) is the rank - size plots for typical outputs , which shows that the distribution of community - sizes does not differ for different optimals .",
    "especially , the presence of the gap is obvious .",
    "the value of modularity is estimated as @xmath82 , where the error is the standard deviation for 10 shuffles .",
    "one may expect that the presence of hubs has a considerable effect to the community structure .",
    "it is , however , the case that the vertices of high - degrees have only a limited effect onto the community structure .",
    "in fact , we take a subgraph consisting of vertices whose degrees are smaller than a threshold @xmath83 , i.e. obtained by deleting the vertices with @xmath84 and links emanating from them . fig .",
    "[ fig : commun ]  ( d ) shows the results of the cnm algorithm to these subgraphs . even if @xmath83 is as low as 30 , deleting more than 8% of vertices ,",
    "the community - size distribution does not differ significantly . when @xmath85 , deleting 25% of vertices , the gap is still present while exceptionally large - sized communities are not extracted with this and smaller thresholds",
    ". only when the threshold is as small as @xmath86 , one has many disconnected components with relatively similar sizes , and the gap disappears .",
    "this result implies that it is important to understand how the majority of vertices with dozens of links are constructing the overall structure of network .",
    "previous models of growing networks do not explain the presence of such a gap found in the distribution of community - sizes .",
    "let us consider three growth models here .",
    "numbers of vertices and links in simulations are precisely equal to the numbers of the sns by adjusting parameters in each model as follows . the preferential attachment model , barabsi - albert ( ba ) model with each new vertex having degree @xmath87 ( see the review @xcite ) shows the distribution of community - sizes in fig .",

    "also visualization of the network of communities differs among the models and from the result for the sns .",
    "the models do not show a gap in the community - sizes which was observed for the friendship network of the sns .",
    "in addition , we performed the cnm algorithm to a real data of collaboration network in physics community , taken from cond - mat , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : commun_diff ]  ( g ) with its visualization in fig .",

    "in order to understand why the community - size distribution has a gap , let us consider how the friendship network in the sns is formed by people .",
    "the network has the following features .",
    "\\(i ) new vertices are added to the network all the time .",
    "the timescale on which vertices join is not much longer than the timescale on which they create and break friendship .",
    "this may differ from other social networks .",
    "\\(ii ) since there is little cost in maintaining a friendship , much smaller than real - life , people can easily accumulate links of friendship .",
    "a vertex degree is a _",
    "variable , so to speak , a quantity integrated in time .",
    "the long - tail distribution of degree observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ]  ( a ) is partly due to this fact .",
    "\\(iii ) as in many social networks , high transitivity is an important feature , a process of triadic closure  people choose new acquaintances who are friends of friends .",
    "the sns facilitates this process with various devices as described in section  [ sec : sns ] .",
    "\\(iv ) the local clustering coefficient has dependence on the degree as @xmath93 .",
    "additionally , the averaged nearest - neighbor degree @xmath39 shows positive degree - correlation in an intermediate range of degrees , while there is a slight negative correlation for high - degrees .",
    "previous studies including @xcite suggest that a process of _ connecting nearest neighbors _ in a growth model of network can provide explanation of the features ( i)(iv ) .",
    "in particular , the concept of _ potential edge _ proposed by vzquez @xcite has a good interpretation here .",
    "a pair of vertices is connected by a potential edge if they are not connected by a link and they have one or more common neighbor .",
    "actually , in the context of sns , people have frequent occasions to get acquainted with friends of friends by potential edges .",
    "unfortunately , however , the community structure studied in section  [ sec : commun ] revealed a feature which can not be explained by previous models of connecting nearest neighbors .",
    "in fact , applying the cnm algorithm to numerically simulated networks generated by the model in @xcite , we found that the distribution of community - size for the cnn model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : commun_diff ]  ( e ) , differs from what we observed for the actual sns in fig .",
    "[ fig : commun ]  ( b ) .",
    "we thus seek for explanation of the feature : +  ( v ) the distribution of community - size has a gap or a discontinuity where few communities are eventually detected by the cnm algorithm .    in social networks including the sns ,",
    "individuals are endowed not only with links , but with sets of characteristics attributed to them .",
    "examples are association to particular groups with specific interests ( hobbies , thoughts , jobs etc . ) , living in geographically near regions , relation of families and relatives , and so on .",
    "one gets acquainted with other people , because one considers them to share one or more characteristics with oneself , but they may not be in the circle of the one s acquaintances before .",
    "thus , in addition to connecting nearest neighbors , people are reaching beyond each circle of friends by making access along dimensions of characteristics which are often unexpected from what the current ties show .",
    "this process would appear to be _ random _ in the current structure of network , as we assume here .",
    "we propose a model based on these two process , connecting nearest neighbors with apparently random linkage , which we refer to as cnnr .",
    "this is a simple extension of cnn @xcite .",
    "the model starts with a single vertex and no links , and iteratively performs the following .    1 .   with probability @xmath94 ,",
    "add a new vertex in the network , create a link from the new vertex to a randomly selected vertex @xmath47 .",
    "at the same time , create a set of potential edges from the new vertex to all the neighbors of @xmath47 .",
    "2 .   with probability @xmath95 , one of the following two processes is performed . 1",
    ".   with probability @xmath96 , convert one potential edge selected at random into an edge .",

    "connect one pair of vertices selected at random with an edge .    while a new vertex joins the network with an additional link at the rate @xmath95 , an edge is either realized from a potential edge or newly created by random linkage at the rate @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath97 .",
    "the rate @xmath91 is the relative frequency of random linkage compared with that of connecting nearest neighbors . if @xmath98 , the model reduces to cnn .",
    "we give a set of results in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ] .",
    "the numbers of vertices and links are adjusted to be equal to @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the sns respectively , by the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ]  ( a ) is the degree distribution , having a long tail .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ]  ( b ) is @xmath32 , which decreases as @xmath7 increases .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ]  ( c ) shows the averaged nearest neighbor degree @xmath39 , which displays a similar result as the real - data .",
    "these properties are basically the same as the cnn model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of community - size has a completely different shape from fig .  [",
    "fig : commun_diff ]  ( e ) .",
    "there exists a gap in a certain range of community - sizes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ]  ( e ) .",
    "note that when @xmath91 is smaller , the gap is smaller in its size and vanishes for @xmath98 . by comparing the values of modularity @xmath75 for different values of @xmath91 , we suppose that the parameter @xmath91 is close to 4% .",
    "additionally , we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnnr ]  ( f ) that the gap in the distribution of community - sizes grows larger as the size of the network increases according to the model of cnnr .",
    "we remark that the size of the network must be large enough in order to detect the presence of the gap .",
    "what does this model tell us about the sns ?",
    "people make the acquaintance of new and yet unfamiliar people more easily , selectively and inexpensively , far more than what had been previously possible without such networking sites . but how can one measure the importance of such augmented acquaintance , in comparison with other social networks ? our model could possibly measure quantitatively the extent with which the apparently random linkage is at work simultaneously as people enlarge the circle of friends _ via _ friends of friends .",
    "for example , it is our implication that the process of random linkage takes place much slower in off - line social networks than it does in the sns we studied and , quite possibly in other such social networking sites . also one could measure possible difference , among individual networking sites , of",
    "how efficiently the process of random linkage is working with the help of various designs and devices in social networking sites .",
    "we studied the network of mutually acknowledged friendships in the largest sns in japan , currently with more than six million people . in our dataset when the site is under uniform growth in the access and in the recruitment , the network is comprised of more than 360,000 people and nearly two million links . by applying to the friendship network the community - extracting method developed by newman and others",
    ", we found a novel feature that there is a certain range of community - sizes for which only few communities are extracted .",
    "this gap in the distribution of community - sizes was not present in giant human networks such as co - purchasing data from a large on - line retailer and collaboration network in physics . also this is not explained by previous growth models of networks .",
    "we present a simple model in order to explain this fact as well as other properties of long - tail degree distribution , correlation between degree and clustering coefficient , and degree correlation .",
    "the model includes two processes of how people get acquainted with others .",
    "one is connecting nearest neighbors  acquaintance occurs at distance of two , friends of friends .",
    "and the other represents the fact that the process of forming links along individual s social attributes other than the current set of ties , itself , e.g. to know the presence of persons with same interests , beyond the circle of friends of friends .    in conclusion",
    ", this apparently random linkage is the process that can explain the gap in the community - size distribution .",
    "the two processes of connecting nearest neighbors and random linkage should be ubiquitous in social networks , but would be at work with varying relative frequency .",
    "it is our conjecture that the size of the gap will increase as the network grows further in the sns .",
    "we claim that it would increase faster than it does in other social networks , as one could estimate quantitatively based on our model .",
    "we would like to thank mixi , inc . for providing us the dataset ,",
    "in which users are all encrypted except us as three users .",
    "our work does not evaluate personality of participants or services in any social networking sites .",
    "we declare no competing interests ."
