    "recently , a great deal of attention has been devoted to metamaterials because such materials can be artificially engineered to have remarkable properties , such as negative index of refraction@xcite , invisibility cloaking@xcite , and superimaging / hyperimaging@xcite , which are difficult or impossible to achieve with natural materials .",
    "initiated by pendry s seminal concept of the perfect lens that could ideally image a perfect copy of a source@xcite , a great variety of superlens@xcite were proposed to achieve sub - diffraction - limited resolution .",
    "fang @xmath1@xcite demonstrated experimentally the feasibility of subwavelength imaging by enhancing evanescent waves through a slab of silver in the optical frequency range .",
    "however , such a silver superlens can only work for the near field , which makes the image difficult to be processed or brought to a focus by conventional optics . to solve this problem , the hyperlens based on metamaterial crystals was proposed@xcite and experimentally realized@xcite , which has the ability to form a magnified image of a subwavelength object in the far field .    in general ,",
    "the hyperlens is a hollow core cylinder or half - cylinder made of anisotropic materials , with the two permittivity tensor components in the radial direction , @xmath2 , and the tangential direction , @xmath3 , being opposite in sign , resulting in a hyperbolic dispersion relation for tm - polarized waves .",
    "the simplest anisotropic metamaterials can be constructed by the deposition of alternating metal - dielectric multilayers . by bending the flat layers into concentrically curved layers",
    ", we could compress progressively the tangential wave - vectors as the waves travel along the radial direction .",
    "therefore , a magnified image carrying information about the detailed structure of the object could propagate into the far field@xcite .",
    "however , owing to its use of curved surfaces , such a hyperlens may not be convenient for practical applications .    in this work",
    ", we present a novel hyperlens made of vortex - like metamaterials that is capable of manipulating subwavelength images along a spiral route .",
    "in one single design , super - resolution image transfer through a curved route of arbitrary angle , long - range image transfer , plane - to - plane imaging and image magnification can be achieved .",
    "such a multi - functional design may contribute to potential applications such as biomedical imaging and nanolithography .",

    "we begin with a vortex - like @xmath17-layered structure shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "1(a ) ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the inner and outer radii of the metamaterial device ) with alternating layers of dielectric and plasmonic materials whose permittivities are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . for the shape of each layer , we have the formula in the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath22,@xmath4,@xmath23 ) [ the @xmath24 is homogenous]@xcite @xmath25 with the starting point in the inner circle , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here , @xmath7 is an oblique angle , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... , @xmath31 .",
    "starting with these @xmath17 points , we can produce @xmath17 curves that inside the metamaterials ( @xmath32 ) into @xmath17 fan - shaped parts shown in fig .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to @xmath22-@xmath4 plane ( tm polarization , magnetic field in the @xmath24 direction ) and the time harmonic factor is @xmath33 .",
    "next , let us cut the layered system along two lines of @xmath14 and @xmath34 , which are taken respectively as the input ( source ) plane and output ( image ) plane , and two other fixed curves @xmath26 and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 the distance between the origin @xmath16 and a fixed point @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) , which are considered as the interfaces of the hyperlens shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "for the simplicity and generality of illustration , we consider the normal direction of the alternating layers as the @xmath5 direction , by rotating at a fixed angle , @xmath7 , from the @xmath8 direction and the @xmath6 direction as another principal axis perpendicular to the @xmath5 direction . in the long - wavelength limit ,",
    "the optical properties of the layered system can be represented by an anisotropic effective medium in the principal coordinate system ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 , \\label{perm}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the kinematical properties of wave propagation in such an effective medium could be understood by looking at the equifrequency contours ( efcs ) of the following dispersion relation@xcite , @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the vacuum wave number ( and @xmath45 the corresponding wavelength ) , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 referring to wave vector components of the principal coordinate system @xmath48 illustrated by fig .",
    ". the equation may be either elliptic or hyperbolic , depending on the signs of the permittivity tensor elements . when sign@xmath49 sign@xmath50 , the efcs represents a hyperbola .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath51 , the hyperbolic efcs tends to be very flat along the @xmath52 direction , which allows high spatial frequency components of any field propagate close to the @xmath53 direction in a raylike fashion , thereby in our proposed hyperlens subwavelength details can be transported along a particular direction @xmath54 from source point to image point indicated by fig .",
    "1(c ) , when the point source is placed at the input plane of @xmath55 , and the distance @xmath15 away from the origin of the hyperlens .     and the corresponding effective anisotropic medium [ ( d)-(f ) ] , respectively .",
    "three cases of different angles of rotation @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are considered .",
    "the point source is placed at the input plane of @xmath55 , and the distance @xmath59 away from the origin of the hyperlens .",
    "the oblique angle is taken as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62.,width=321 ]",
    "we consider a practical and lossy configuration featuring a point source placed at the input plane @xmath55 and a distance @xmath59 away from the origin of the hyperlens , constitutive parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the mask near the input plane is used to block the input light in our simulations .",
    "figures 2(a)-2(c ) show the image of a point source through three layered structures for different rotation of image with @xmath65 and @xmath58 . as we expect , light rays are bent along a fixed curve @xmath54 and form a resolvable image at a flat output plane @xmath34 , which is in agreement with the fact that subwavelength details of the source are effectively transported with small distortion . it is observed that worse localization and weaker intensity of images are accompanied by larger angle rotation of image . to give us intuitive guidance",

    "figure 3(a ) gives the fwhm and ( normalized ) peak intensity as a function of @xmath4 for two cases of different oblique angle @xmath60 and @xmath73 .",
    "consistently with the the visual impression from fig .",
    "2 , both of the observables deteriorate .",
    "more specifically , over the range @xmath74 in the case of @xmath60 , the fwhm increases from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , while the ( normalized ) peak intensity decreases from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . however , larger oblique angle [ i.e. @xmath66 shown by dotted lines in fig .",
    "3(a ) ] results in a larger degradation of the image resolution and intensity .",
    "as we tune the permittivity @xmath20 of dielectric layer , and the real part of effective parameter @xmath79 deviates away from zero , the image quality will be reduced rapidly , while the peak intensity varies slowly as seen from fig .",
    "however , just for re@xmath80 , over - amplification of some evanescent waves can not be eliminated completely , it may deteriorate image quality to some extent @xcite .     when @xmath7 are taken as @xmath81 ( solid lines ) , and @xmath73 ( dotted lines ) , respectively .",
    ", width=321 ]    on the other hand , we show in fig .",
    "4 that subwavelength image could be transferred over several wavelengths for larger @xmath7 and @xmath67 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath66 and @xmath82 , image transfer distance of nearly four wavelengths could be attained , which follows the formula @xmath83 - 1)$ ] .",
    "therefore such a hyperlens could act as an optical component that makes long - distance transfer of subwavelength image between unparallel input and output planes , simultaneously with an arbitrary angle of rotation , @xmath84 with respect to the origin of the hyperlens .     and",
    "two point sources at the input plane @xmath55 are separated by @xmath86 , where the ratio of the source amplitudes is @xmath87.,width=283 ]     of the magnetic energy density for different cases of oblique angle @xmath88 and @xmath85 .",
    "other parameters are the same as fig .",
    "5.,width=359 ]    moreover , for our proposed hyperlens , if we put two sources on the input plane with their distance @xmath89 , their images will be transferred to the output plane by means of two curved rays [ along the direction @xmath54 ] , and the image separation will appear to be @xmath91 $ ] on that plane . since @xmath92 could be much greater than zero",
    ", images generated on the output plane could be far enough apart to be resolved by a conventional optical device on the output plane .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "5 the functionality of the image magnification through the proposed hyperlens for three configurations of different oblique angle @xmath7 with a fixed angle of rotation @xmath93 .",
    "two point sources at the input plane separated by @xmath86 have been well imaged at the output plane .",
    "the magnification could even approach to be near @xmath94 times shown in fig .",
    "the line scans at the output plane of magnetic energy density have been illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , which clearly indicate planar objects with deep subwavelength features can be projected and magnified to wavelength scale planar image .",
    "unfortunately , the special dispersion of such a vortex - like metamaterial and its geometry provide only 1d magnification@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , compared to the  oblique cut \" geometry in ref .",
    "@xcite , the proposed vortex - like structure can transfer subwavelength images along a spiral route of any rotating angle , which provides a more flexible way to manipulate super - resolution image .",
    "it is noticed that the images display different magnitudes of intensity due to the variant length of light path , which leads to different losses .",
    "this effect can , in principle , be compensated through a nonuniform illumination of the input plane@xcite , or by designing a compensating lens to ensure the lengths of ray traces from input plane to the output plane are the same@xcite .",
    "we remark that practical fabrication of such a vortex - like metamaterial could be challenging .",
    "however , it is found that complicated ultrafine nanostructures could be fabricated with single - nanometer precision in both feature size and location .",
    "therefore , it is expected that several advanced fabrications may enable us to achieve such a vortex - like structure@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we demonstrated that a vortex - like metamaterials is capable of manipulating subwavelength images along a spiral route of arbitrary turning angle . using the same design , long - range image transfer , plane - to - plane imaging and image magnification can also be achieved .",
