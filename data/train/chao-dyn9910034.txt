    "the study of heat conduction in models of insulating solids is a long - standing and debated problem . in 1929",
    "r. peierls provided the first convincing theoretical explanation of this phenomenon , relying upon the hypothesis that lattice vibrations responsible for heat transport in insulating solids can be described as a diluted gas of quantum quasi - particles , the _ phonons _ @xcite .",
    "peierls model extends boltzmann s kinetic theory of the classical ideal gas to the phonon gas , by substituting collisions in real space with umklapp processes in momentum space . due to the quantum character of this approach ,",
    "umklapp processes were theoretically justified as a perturbative effect , epitomizing the scattering of phonons originated by intrinsic features of real solids : disorder and nonlinearity .",
    "the main achievement of peierls theory is the prediction of the proportionality relation between the thermal conductivity @xmath1 and the specific heat at constant volume @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the average velocity and the mean free path of phonons , respectively . using debye s formula ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on the temperature @xmath6 was found to agree with experimental observations in the low - temperature regime .",
    "nonetheless , at least in the high temperature regime , there is no reason why a purely classical model of an insulating solid should not reproduce the correct behaviour of @xmath7 and fourier s law @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the heat flux and the temperature field , respectively . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first attempt of its theoretical justification on the basis of a microscopic model of a solid was made in a seminal paper by rieder , lebowitz and lieb @xcite .",
    "they considered a chain of @xmath11 coupled harmonic oscillators in contact at its extrema with stochastic thermal baths at different temperatures .",
    "they prove that in this simple model of a purely harmonic solid thermal conductivity diverges in the thermodynamoc limit as @xmath12 .",
    "consistently , the temperature profile in the bulk of the chain is flat .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results is that harmonic lattice waves , i.e. fourier s modes , freely propagate through the lattice , thus contributing to a ballistic rather than diffusive transmission of heat .",
    "the same result was obtained numerically for another integrable model , the 1d toda lattice @xcite .",
    "its normal modes , the so - called _ toda solitons _ , are nonlinear waves localized in space and also freely propagating through the lattice .",
    "more generally , any integrable hamiltonian system is expected to be characterized by anomalous transport properties since its normal modes , in the perspective of kinetic theory , are equivalent to a `` gas '' of non - interacting free particles . following peierls , the addition of generic disorder and nonlinearity should overtake these anomalies by introducing effective diffusive behaviour .",
    "numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite estimates performed for the mass - disordered harmonic chain still yield anomalous transport , @xmath13 , although the temperature gradient was found to be nonzero @xcite . accordingly",
    ", disorder is not sufficient to guarantee normal transport properties .",
    "it remains nonlinearity , that since the 70 s has been widely studied also as a source of chaotic behaviour .",
    "in fact , despite its deterministic nature , chaos was shown to yield good statistical properties , namely ergodic behaviour , for most of the thermodinamically relevant observables . accordingly",
    ", many attempts were made with models of chains of nonlinearly coupled oscillators , that did not achieve convincing conclusions ( e.g. , see@xcite ) . finally , casati et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the ding - a - ling model that exhibits normal heat conductivity .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same result has been confirmed one decade later by prosen and robnik @xcite for the ding - dong model - a variant of the ding - a - ling one .",
    "the great merit of the former paper has been to point out the possibility of obtaining normal conductivity in a nonlinear dynamical model ; the latter , thanks also to the increase of computational facilities , has provided convincing evidence of this result by very careful and time consuming numerical simulations .",
    "anyway , in both cases strong chaos has been argued to be the basic mechanism responsible for normal transport properties . in this perspective , one could conjecture that the doubtful results obtained for chaotic potentials , yielding interactions smoother than elastic collisions could deserve extremely lengthy numerical simulations before showing standard transport properties ( e.g. , see@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the explanation of the above mentioned results is quite different .",
    "both ding - models can be thought as interacting particles bounded to a local , or _",
    ", potential . by substituting the elastic collisions - responsible for the strong chaotic behaviour of these models - with any nonlinear nearest - neighbour interaction potential , numerical evidence of finite thermal conductivity",
    "is achieved ( for instance , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "conversely , if the substrate term is absent small wavenumber , i.e. _ hydrodynamic _ , modes , as a consequence of the conservation of momentum , exhibit a peculiar slow relaxation @xcite .",
    "this effect can be traced back to the vanishing of the generalized frequency @xmath14 in the limit of small wavenumber , @xmath15 , characterizing the dispersion relation in presence of an acoustic band @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the frequency associated with the local potential lifts the acoustic band from zero , thus making possible the diffusion of the _ hydrodynamic _ modes energy .",
    "this notwithstanding , it is certainly non - trivial that a purely deterministic chaotic dynamics can give rise to an effective diffusive behaviour . nonetheless , chaos alone is a necessary but not sufficient ingredient for obtaining normal trasport properties .",
    "some progress in the understanding of transport properties in nonlinear lattices has been made recently by exploiting the analogy with the mode - coupling theory , that applies to models of dense fluids rather than diluted gases .",
    "numerical simulations carried out for a 1d lattice with quartic nonlinearity - the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) @xmath16-model - have shown a power law dependence of the thermal conductivity on the system size : @xmath17 , with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained for a chain in contact with thermal baths and by equilibrium measurements of @xmath1 based on the green - kubo formula of linear response theory ( for technical details , see also sec.4 ) .",
    "taking advantage of the results reported in @xcite , it was possible to conclude that , even for strongly chaotic dynamics , the amplitudes of low wavenumber modes evolve like weakly damped stochastic harmonic oscillators , whose frequencies are _ renormalized _ w.r.t .",
    "the standard harmonic component of the fpu @xmath16-model by leading nonlinear terms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "large wavenumber modes behave like _ fast variables _ , governed by a _ thermal _ behaviour .",
    "this is the typical scheme that applies to dense fluids in fourier space .",
    "self - consistent mode coupling theory ( smt ) @xcite allows one to determine the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath11 from the integral of the time - correlation function of the total heat flux , yielding in the 1d case the power law @xmath19 in very good agreement with numerics .",
    "this power - law has been recovered also in many other models of nonlinearly coupled oscillators like the diatomic toda chain @xcite , the lennard - jones ( lj ) 6/12 model and the morse potential @xcite .",
    "all of these models share one common feature : they are single - well confining potentials .",
    "also in the light of the results recently obtained in @xcite , the scaling law ( [ scal ] ) , typical of this class of models , seems to be directly related to this property .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , due to its generality , smt can be extended to determine the dependence of transport coefficients on the system size in higher space dimensions . for the class of models of interest in this paper",
    ", it predicts that @xmath1 should diverge logarithmically with @xmath11 in 2d ( see section 4 ) , while in 3d @xmath1 is normal , i.e. independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the aim of this paper is the numerical and analytical study of the thermodynamic limit properties of thermal conductivity @xmath1 in the 2d case , by taking into account two examples of single - well confining potentials : the fpu @xmath16 and the lj-(6/12 ) models .",
    "more precisely , in section 2 we introduce the models and we also discuss some general features of the simplified lattice representation of anharmonic 2d solids used in this paper . in section 3",
    "we present the results concerning the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath11 obtained by two different numerical approaches , based on two different definitions of @xmath1 .",
    "an explicit derivation of the analytical prediction of smt is worked out in section 4 , where we also discuss the presence of a _ superanomalous _ divergence of transport coefficients in the weakly chaotic regime , that typically characterizes the above mentioned models for sufficiently small energy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are contained in section 5 .",
    "most of the studies on the heat conduction problem in anharmonic lattices has been devoted to 1d systems .",
    "time - consuming numerical simulations were the main limitation for large scale analysis of this problem in 2d .",
    "in fact , only a few contributions have been worked out .",
    "for instance in @xcite the dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath1 on the temperature @xmath6 is studied in a 2d triangular lattice of unit mass atoms interacting via a lj 6/12 potential .",
    "numerical data are consistent with the expected classical law @xmath20 , while the dependence of @xmath1 on the system size is not investigated .",
    "an interesting contribution in this direction is the paper by jackson and mistriotis @xcite .",
    "the authors compare measurements of @xmath1 in 1d and 2d fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattices and they conclude that in both cases there is no evidence that the transport coefficient is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more recent and extended numerical simulations performed for the 2d toda - lattice @xcite have been interpreted in favour of the finiteness of @xmath1 in this case .    as usual ,",
    "numerical analysis alone without any piece of a theory can hardly yield conclusive results . on the other hand ,",
    "as already stressed in @xcite , the dependence of @xmath1 on the system size can not be adequately described by peierls model : at least in the high temperature ( i.e. , classical ) limit .",
    "the perturbative umklapp processes can not account for the genuine nonlinear effects that characterize such a dependence .",
    "the theoretical approach proposed in @xcite and careful numerical analysis of 1d systems @xcite , provide a first coherent explanation of the divergence of @xmath21 in the thermodynamic limit .    in this paper",
    "we want to extend this study to 2d systems . for this purpose ,",
    "let us first describe the adopted lattice model of a homogeneous 2d solid .",
    "we consider a square lattice made of @xmath22 equal mass ( @xmath23 ) atoms .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the atoms coincide with the lattice sites , labelled by a pair of integer indices @xmath24 . without loss of generality",
    ", the lattice spacing @xmath25 can be set equal to unit and the origin of the cartesian reference frame can be fixed in such a way that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , the 2d - vector of equilibrium position , @xmath28 , coincides with @xmath24 .",
    "the _ short - range _ character of interatomic forces in real solids is simplified by assuming that the atoms interact by a nearest - neighbour confining potential @xmath29 , that depends on the relative displacement @xmath30 with respect to the equilibrium distance .",
    "the natural ordering of the atoms induced by this kind of local interaction allows to identify with the same couple of indices @xmath24 the corresponding atom in any dynamical configuration .",
    "specifically , the model is described by the general hamiltonian @xmath31 \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the instantaneous position vector of the @xmath24-atom and @xmath34 is the corresponding momentum vector .",
    "the time dependence of the canonical variables has been omitted in eq.([ham ] ) . without prejudice of generality",
    "we set also @xmath35 .    since we are interested in studying the thermal conductivity @xmath1 in this 2d model , we have also to define the relevant physical observables , namely the temperature @xmath36 and the heat flux @xmath37 .",
    "let us start from the local energy density @xmath38 where @xmath39 \\label{dh } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that local equilibrium holds we obtain immediately a definition of the local temperature @xmath36 by applying the virial theorem : @xmath40 where @xmath41 indicates either the @xmath42- or the @xmath43-component of the corresponding vector variables .",
    "the formal definition of the time average symbol is @xmath44 . in numerical experiments the time - average must be performed over a finite time span , in general much larger that the local equilibration time .    for hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "one can use the simple expression @xmath45 the heat flux vector is implicitely defined by the continuity equation @xmath46 by rewriting this equation in fourier - space and retaining the leading hydrodynamic contribution ( i.e. , by applying the large wavelenght limit ) one obtains an explicit expression for the components of @xmath47 @xmath48 \\cr j^{(y)}_{ij } & = - \\frac { 1}{4 } a\\left[f^{xy}_{ij}\\left(p^{(x)}_{ij } +   p^{(x)}_{ij+1}\\right ) + f^{yy}_{ij}\\left(p^{(y)}_{ij } + p^{(y)}_{ij+1}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the components of the local vector forces are defined as follows @xmath49 } { \\partial q^{(x)}_{ij } } \\quad f^{yx}_{ij } = - \\frac{\\partial v \\left[\\left| \\vec q_{i+1j }   - \\vec q_{ij}\\right|\\right]}{\\partial q^{(y)}_{ij}}\\ ] ] @xmath50 } { \\partial q^{(x)}_{ij } } \\quad f^{yy}_{ij } = - \\frac{\\partial v \\left[\\left|",
    "\\vec q_{ij+1 }   - \\vec q_{ij}\\right|\\right]}{\\partial q^{(y)}_{ij}}\\ ] ]    it is worth defining also the space - time average of the heat flux vector @xmath51 that will be widely used in the following sections .",
    "finally , since we are interested to investigate thermodynamic limit properties , we should impose periodic boundary conditions ( _ pbc _ ) , that are the standard choice for reducing as much as possible undesired boundary effects on bulk properties .",
    "the numerical simulations that we are going to describe in this section have been performed for two different single - well potentials :    @xmath52    @xmath53    the reasons for this twofold choice are the following :    * analyzing heat tansport in the 2d version of the widely studied case of potential @xmath54 ; * verifying the theoretical prediction ( see next section ) that nearest - neighbour single - well nonlinear potentials exhibit the same kind of dependence of @xmath21 in the large @xmath11 limit ; * investigating the possible consequences on transport properties of the slowing - down of relaxation below the so called _ strong stochasticity threshold _",
    ", that was measured for potential @xmath55 in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath54 does not contain any natural energy and length scales ; all numerical simulations with this potential have been performed with @xmath56 and with an integration time step @xmath57 , that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum harmonic period ( @xmath58 ) .    at variance with @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath55 is characterized by natural length and energy scales , the equilibrium distance @xmath59 and the well depth @xmath60 , respectively . in order to make the two models as close as possible",
    "we have chosen the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 in such a way that the coefficients of the second and fourth order terms of the taylor series expansion of @xmath55 around its minimum coincide with those of @xmath54 , thus obtaining @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in numerical experiments",
    "we have adopted a time step @xmath66 , that guarantees a sufficient sampling of the integration algorithm especially when strong nonlinearities are explored by the dynamics .",
    "numerical measurements of the thermal conductivity @xmath1 as a function of the lattice size @xmath11 have been performed under nonequilibrium and equilibrium conditions : the former are inspired by an ideal experiment for the verification of fourier s law ( [ fourier ] ) , the latter stem from linear response theory ( see sec .",
    "both approaches are theoretically equivalent ; nonetheless , their comparison on a numerical ground is quite instructive .",
    "nonetheless , this kind of numerical simulations are quite heavy , so that any trick for saving cpu time is worth to be applied . since we are interested in investigating thermodynamic limit properties we have to perform measurements keeping the ratio @xmath67 constant .",
    "on the other hand , there is _ a priori _ no reason for choosing @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , we have checked that reliable measurements of @xmath1 can be obtained in lattices with @xmath69 . as an example , in fig.[fluxtras ] we show the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath70 for @xmath71 and for potential @xmath55 , in the presence of thermal baths acting on the boundary atoms at temperatures @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( details are given in the next subsection ) . after a sharp increase for small values of @xmath70 thermal conductivity",
    "@xmath1 reaches a plateau already for @xmath74 .",
    "this preliminary analysis has been performed for both potentials @xmath54 and @xmath55 in nonequilibrium and in equilibrium simulations : we have concluded that @xmath75 is a reasonable compromise , valid in all of these cases .      a straightforward way of measuring thermal conductivity @xmath1 amounts to simulate numerically a true experiment where the atoms at the left and right edges of the 2d lattice are coupled with two thermal baths at different temperatures @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this setting restricts the application of _ pbc _ to the direction orthogonal to the temperature gradient : we impose _ pbc _ along the y - axis , while the boundary atoms are coupled to a rigid wall through the force link with the missing atom in the @xmath42-direction .",
    "various models of thermal baths , either stochastic or deterministic ones , are at disposal .",
    "the results of numerical simulations reported in this paper have been obtained by using the nos - hoover deterministic model @xcite .",
    "it has two advantages with respect to stochastic algorithms : it can be easily implemented as an ordinary differential equation and it reduces the residual thermal impedence effects at the lattice boundaries .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath78 \\cr \\dot\\zeta_{n_xj } & = & \\frac{1}{\\theta^2}\\left[{|{\\vec p}_{n_xj}|^2   \\over { 2t_r } } -1\\right ] \\label{algo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the kronecker symbol . in practice ,",
    "the integration scheme ( [ algo ] ) has been implemented by a standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "note that each boundary atom is coupled through the momentum equation to its thermal bath variable @xmath80 , that guarantees local thermal equilibrium at temparature @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the left and right boundaries , respectively .",
    "starting from random initial conditions after a sufficiently long transient time stationary nonequilibrium evolution is eventually approached .",
    "according to the heat equation ( [ fourier ] ) , a constant thermal gradient should establish through the lattice in the x - direction and @xmath81 , while @xmath82 . here",
    ", the symbol @xmath83 indicates the time average over stationary nonequilibrium states .",
    "the time span , over which good convergence of the time - average is obtained , increases with @xmath84 : for instance , @xmath85 integration steps are sufficient for @xmath86 , while for @xmath71 this time grows up to @xmath87 .",
    "the occurrence of stationary nonequilibrium conditions can be checked by verifying the equality @xmath88 where the r.h.s .",
    "is the average heat flux flowing through the boundaries . despite in numerical simulations",
    "finite time - averages never yield exactly @xmath89 , one finds that @xmath90 is very well approximated by @xmath91 .",
    "some of the stationary temperature profiles obtained for different values of @xmath84 for potential @xmath54 and @xmath55 are shown in figures [ profpu ] and [ prolj ] , respectively .",
    "the values of the temperature @xmath92 have been averaged also in space over all the @xmath70 atoms with abscissa @xmath93 : @xmath94 it is worth stressing that the local temperature @xmath36 is a time - averaged quantity ( see eq.([temp ] ) ) over the stationary nonequilibrium evolution .",
    "the lattice length has been rescaled to unit in order to verify the overlap of the profiles for increasing values of @xmath84 : in both cases we observe a good data collapse for @xmath95 indicating that the temperature gradient in the thermodynamic limit vanishes as @xmath96    in the fpu @xmath16-model the temperatures of the thermal baths , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , have been chosen for obtaining good ergodic properties of the dynamics , i.e. fast relaxation to local equilibrium .",
    "boundary effects of thermal impedence induced by the coupling with the thermal baths are reduced for increasing values of @xmath84 .",
    "the temperature gradient looks quite close to a constant , but a more careful inspection shows that the profile has a slight curvature .",
    "the effect is even more evident for the lennard - jones model , whose temperature profiles converge to an s - shaped curve . in particular , thermal impedence at the boundaries seems to persist also in the large @xmath84 limit , despite the smaller values of @xmath99 and @xmath73 , that already guarantee ergodicity for this model .",
    "such deviations from fourier s law indicate that nonlinearities influence boundary effects and also the dependence of @xmath1 on the temperature . on the other hand , we are interested in extracting the scaling of @xmath1 with the system size @xmath84 . it can be obtained on the basis of fourier s law and eq.([gradsc ] ) by plotting the quantity @xmath100 versus @xmath84 ( see figures [ kappafpu ] and [ kappalj ] ) . for both 2d models",
    "we find evidence of a logarithmic scaling of @xmath1 with @xmath84 .",
    "the above described nonequilibrium measurements of the heat transport coefficient @xmath1 have been made keeping @xmath76 and @xmath77 constant for increasing values of @xmath84 .",
    "the data collapse of the temperature profiles implies also that in the thermodinamic limit , @xmath101 , the temperature gradient in the bulk of the chain drops to zero .",
    "accordingly , for increasing values of @xmath84 nonequilibrium measurements are expected to reproduce better and better linear response conditions .",
    "the green - kubo linear response theory @xcite provides an alternative definition of @xmath1 with respect to the one contained in fourier s law .",
    "more precisely , a general expression of the heat conductivity tensor for a solid contained in a volume @xmath102 is given by the formula @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the boltzmann constant and the time correlation function of the heat flux components along the @xmath105 and @xmath106 directions is averaged over equilibrium states at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "note that the symbol @xmath107 indicates now the equilibrium ensemble average .",
    "in our models of homogeneous 2d nonlinear solids the thermal conductivity corresponds indifferently to anyone of the diagonal components of the transport coefficient tensor defined in ( [ gk ] ) . in particular",
    "we have chosen to measure    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the @xmath42-component of the space - averaged heat flux vector ( [ avflux ] ) .",
    "as in nonequilibrium measurements fixing the ratio @xmath110 is a good compromise for reducing cpu time , while maintaining reliable asymptotic estimates of @xmath1 .    we have performed numerical simulations at constant energy density , @xmath111 , by eliminating the thermal bath variables @xmath80 s from eq.([algo ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been imposed also in the @xmath42-direction , so that the 2d lattice becomes a torus . in practice",
    "the integration scheme has been implemented by a fourth order maclachlan - atela symplectic algorithm @xcite , that is more appropriate than a runge - kutta one for this kind of _ microcanonical _ simulations .",
    "the expression on the r.h.s of eq.([gkx ] ) can be evaluated numerically for finite values of @xmath112 .",
    "accordingly , we define a `` finite time '' thermal conductivity @xmath113 by removing from eq.([gk ] ) the limit operation @xmath114 . in order to reduce fluctuations ,",
    "the heat flux time - correlation function has been averaged over a sufficiently large set of random initial conditions , extracted from the microcanonical probability distribution . for sufficiently large values of @xmath112 both models ( [ fpupot ] ) and ( [ ljpot ] ) exhibit a logarithmic divergence of @xmath113 . as an example , in figure [ ljkubo ] we report the case of the lennard - jones ( 6 - 12)-model . despite highly time",
    "consuming simulations have been performed for averaging over initial conditions , in this example fluctuations are still persistent for large values of @xmath112 .",
    "this notwithstanding , numerical data are compatible with the expected logarithmic divergence .",
    "according to the argument reported in @xcite this divergence in time can be assimilated to a divergence with the system size @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , numerical estimates of the time - correlation function of the local heat flux , @xmath115 show that in single - well nonlinear potentials , due to the `` rigidity '' of low - wavenumber modes ( see next section ) , the energy propagates with the velocity of sound in a nonlinear medium ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the velocity of sound due to the harmonic component of the nonlinear potential and the renormalization factor @xmath118 introduces a dependence of @xmath119 on the total energy , indicating its nonlinear character .",
    "we have verified that these features are common to the potentials ( [ fpupot ] ) and ( [ ljpot ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath120 for finite time @xmath112 in the green - kubo integral can be assimilated to an estimate of the divergence with the system size by the formal relation @xmath121 . in this sense ,",
    "equilibrium simulations confirm the results of nonequilibrium ones .",
    "the conjecture that deterministic chaos is an efficient mechanism for ergodic behaviour has been extensively investigated by numerical experiments in many degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems , like those introduced in section 2 .",
    "one of the main issues is that , for sufficiently high energy density @xmath111 , the time averages of most observables of thermodynamic interest rapidly approach the expectation value predicted by equilibrium ensembles .",
    "this notwithstanding , below a specific value @xmath122 - the so - called strong stochasticity threshold ( _ sst _ ) ( see @xcite and the references therein contained ) - the equilibration time may increase dramatically , despite the persistence of deterministic chaos .",
    "it is not our aim , here , to discuss why such a slow relaxation mechanism typically occurs in these models .",
    "we just want to stress that their _ mild _ nonlinear character make them quite different from _ mathematically _ standard chaotic models like k- or a - systems .",
    "in fact , the results obtained in @xcite show that regularities are present even above the sst .",
    "more precisely , in a 1d fpu chain the amplitudes of low-@xmath123 fourier modes are found to evolve like weakly damped and forced harmonic oscillators .",
    "dissipation and forcing epitomize the complex nonlinear mechanism of energy exchange among the modes and they are found to vanish in the limit @xmath124 .",
    "one can argue that these can be only an effect induced by global , i.e. _ hydrodynamic _ , conservation laws of total momentum and energy . in this sense , such a behaviour is expected to be present in any space dimension @xmath125 , although the possibilities of energy exchanges among the modes are expected to become more and more efficient for increasing values of @xmath125 .",
    "these remarks suggests that , in a nonlinear model of a solid , fourier modes can be assimilated to a dense fluid rather than to a diluted gas , as in peierls phonon theory .",
    "relying upon the above conjecture , strongly supported by numerical simulations , we want to derive an analytical estimate of the thermodynamic limit behaviour of thermal conductivity @xmath1 for 2d single - well anharmonic lattices . in practice , here we explicitely extend to the 2d case the method introduced in @xcite and described in detail for the 1d case in @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of the fourier modes in a 2d square lattice have the standard expression @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the canonical space coordinate and the 2d wave - vector @xmath128 has components @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "numerical experiments show that low-@xmath123 fourier modes behave like _ slow _ dynamical variable , whose relaxation time scales are much longer than those of high-@xmath123 modes , that play the role of _ fast _ variables .",
    "this analogy with hydrodynamic properties of dense fluids suggests the application of smt @xcite .",
    "since the hydrodynamic behaviour is ruled by low-@xmath123 modes , the first step amounts to project the dynamics onto the subspace of slow variables @xmath138 by a proper projection operator @xmath139 \\label{mori}\\ ] ] according to linear response theory the equations of motion can be casted in the form @xcite : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the effective force , that is related by the dissipation - fluctuation theorem to the memory kernel as follows : @xmath142 note that in the projected equations of motion the harmonic frequency @xmath133 is renormalized to the energy dependent frequency @xmath143 where @xmath144 in the last formula we have introduced the microcanonical average by assuming that equilibrium properties are practically guaranteed by the fast thermalization of high-@xmath123 modes . as observed also in @xcite the projected slow variables can be interpreted as `` nonlinear '' fourier modes , whose frequency is renormalized by anharmonic contributions .",
    "numerical simulations support this approach also thanks to the remarkable quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ renor ] ) .",
    "the projected equations of motion have a clear theoretical interpretation but they are practically useless for working out analytical calculations .",
    "we have to introduce some simplifying hypotheses .",
    "we suppose that the time scale of slow hydrodynamic variables can be unambigously separated form the typical microscopic time scales : specifically , this amounts to reduce the memory kernel @xmath145 to a @xmath79 distribution and the fluctuating force @xmath146 to a stochastic force . by introducing an explicit complex - variable representation of the mode amplitudes , @xmath147",
    "we rewrite the set of equations ( [ projec ] ) in the approximate form of standard stochastic equations : @xmath148 where @xmath149 can be interpreted as an effective dissipation coefficient , while fluctuations are now assumed to be represented by gaussian white noise processes : @xmath150 it is convenient to introduce the scalar variable @xmath151 that satisfies the langevin type equation : @xmath152 where @xmath153 according to the definition ( [ avflux ] ) the average heat flux vector can be thought as the sum of a harmonic term and an anharmonic one , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "the harmonic term is obtained by considering only the forces given by the quadratic part of the interaction potential : simple calculations show that its components can be written in the form : @xmath156 where @xmath157 in close analogy with the renormalization of the effective frequency of slow variables , it can be shown that the leading contribution to @xmath155 , stemming from the anharmonic part of the interaction potential , is proportional to @xmath154 through an energy ( and also model ) dependent factor @xmath158 , i.e. @xmath159 . for instance , the expression of @xmath158 in the fpu @xmath16-model ( [ fpupot ] ) is @xmath160    summarizing , the components of the average heat flux vector can be expressed in general by the proportionality relations @xmath161 assuming the validity of the generalized equipartiton theorem @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a function of the energy @xmath164 , and using the solution of ( [ lang ] ) , one can obtain an analytical estimate of the heat flux time - correlation function present in the green - kubo integral ( [ gk ] ) : @xmath165 where the last expression is obatined by assuming that in the thermodynamic limit the summation can be approximated by an integral .",
    "the explicit dependence of the dissipation coefficient @xmath166 on the modulus of the wave - vector @xmath136 is provided by smt @xcite .",
    "specifically , it predicts that the time - correlation functions of hydrodynamic modes decay in time as follows : @xmath167 where the @xmath14 are complex generalized frequencies ruling the oscillatory and relaxation behaviour of the hydrodynamic modes . for 2d homogeneous systems they depend just on @xmath168 and their explicit expression in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath124 ,",
    "is found to be @xmath169 where @xmath119 is the velocity of sound in the homogeneous medium and the second addendum of the r.h.s .",
    "is the dissipation term @xmath170 . substituting into eq.([corr ] ) and retaining only the leading contribution to the function @xmath171 in the limit @xmath124 , one obtains the estimate @xmath172 accordingly , the heat conductivity @xmath1 is predicted to diverge as @xmath173 in the @xmath114 limit in 2d lattices .",
    "it is worth stressing that smt predicts also that @xmath174 in 1d systems , yielding a diverging heat conductivity @xmath175 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the very good agreement with numerical experiments ( see @xcite ) strengthen the conjecture that the anomalous properties of transport coefficients in nonlinear lattice models stems from the hydrodynamic nature of low-@xmath123 effective modes .",
    "said differently , total energy and momentum conservation laws impose on models with single - well potentials a dispersion relation yielding a subdiffusive behaviour of the energy exchange among these modes and , consequently , ill - defined transport coefficients . on the other hand",
    ", smt predicts that in 3d the green - kubo integral is convergent so that @xmath1 becomes a well defined quantity .",
    "this dependence on the space dimension and the generality of predictions ( at least for what concerns the class of single - well nonlinear potentials ) make this piece of theory quite elegant and physically sound .",
    "all the numerical simulations presented in section 3 have been performed in the strong chaotic regime of the dynamics . in this case",
    "ergodic behaviour occurs quite rapidly on the microscopic time scale , with the exception of hydrodynamic modes , whose slow relaxation , due to macroscopic conservation laws , rules the observed divergence of transport coefficients . in the above theoretical treatment this corresponds to the assumption that time - correlation functions can be estimated on the basis of equilibrium ensemble averages .    on the other hand , we know that below the sst relaxation to equilibrium may slow - down dramatically for most of the physically interesting observables . according to the results reported in @xcite the heat flux is expected to belong to this class of observables .",
    "then , we expect also that in such a dynamical regime the transport mechanism can be significantly modified .    we have checked this conjecture by considering model ( [ ljpot ] ) , whose sst has been estimated @xcite at a value of the energy density @xmath176 in the units adopted in this paper .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations with thermal baths at temperature @xmath177 and @xmath178 for different values of @xmath84 verifying the data collapse of the temperature profiles .",
    "following the same approach described in section 3.1 we have estimated the dependence of the thermal conductivity on @xmath84 .",
    "we find evidence of a power - law divergence @xmath179 with @xmath180 ( see fig.[kappasst ] ) .",
    "note that below the sst the exponent @xmath181 is a function of the energy density @xmath111 .",
    "the power law divergence of @xmath1 below the sst is confirmed by the numerical estimate of the green - kubo integral . in fig .",
    "[ gkubosst ] we compare dependence of @xmath1 on time @xmath112 for @xmath182 and for @xmath183  , below and above the sst , respectively . the comparison of the two curves in a linear versus logarithmic scale shows that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath120 is completely different in the two chaotic dynamical regimes . in particular , for @xmath183 we recover a logarithmic divergence , while for @xmath182 we find a power law divergence @xmath184 with @xmath185 .    for what concerns the interpretation of this last result , one has to observe that for a sufficiently long time equilibrium conditions will be eventually approached .",
    "the asymptotic time dependence of the green - kubo integral should turn to the logarithmic growth on any finite system .",
    "the relevance of this _ superanomalous _ effect could be established only by evaluating the dependence of the relaxation time on the system size .",
    "estimates obtained for relatively small size systems seem to indicate that the crossover time between the power - law and the logarithmic behaviour of the green - kubo integral icreases more than linearly with the system size @xmath84 . on the other hand , as we have often pointed out along this paper , numerics may can provide crucial insight for the understanding of these phenomena , but can not be assumed as a proof of anything . since this effect might have very interesting physical consequences we hope to work out in the near future an analytical approach apt to describe the _ superanomaly _ of transport coefficients below the sst .",
    "the presence of anomalous thermal conductivity in 2d lattices of atoms coupled by nonlinear nearest - neighbour single - well potentials has been verified by numerical experiments and analytical estimates . according to smt",
    ", the effect of dimensionality is found to make the thermodynamic limit power - law divergence of 1d models turn to a logarithmic divergence of 2d models , thus confirming the soundness of the general theoretical framework worked out to interpret such anomalous properties emerging from strongly chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in this dynamical regime 3d models are predicted to exhibit normal transport properties , i.e. finite thermal conductivity .    in this paper",
    "we have also pointed out that a superanomalous behaviour ruled by a power - law divergence of the thermal conductivity , seems to characterize transport properties of 2d models below the sst .",
    "such a behaviour has been observed also in 1d systems where the crossing of the sst corresponds to an increase of the power from the value 2/5 towards the limit value 1 , that is expected to be approached for vanishing energy densities ( i.e. in the harmonic limit ) .",
    "here we have decided to report just the results for 2d systems , where the comparison between the power - law and the logarithmic divergence stresses the effect of the extremely slow relaxation mechanism already observed almost half a century ago in the seminal numerical experiment by e. fermi , j. pasta and s. ulam @xcite .    at present",
    "we are not able to conclude just on the basis of numerical simulations if superanomalous transport is a finite size effect or an asymptotic property , that could even concern 3d systems .",
    "also in this case , the construction of a suitable theoretical approach would greatly help in answering to this interesting question .        we want to thank s. lepri , a. politi and m. vassalli for many useful discussions and suggestions .",
    "one of the authors ( r.l . ) wants to acknowledge also the kind hospitality of the institute for scientific interchange in torino during the workshop `` complexity and chaos '' 1999 , when part of this work has been performed ."
