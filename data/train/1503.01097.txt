    "topological insulators ( tis ) are a new class of materials with a fully insulating gap in the bulk but gapless ( conducting ) dirac fermion states on the surface@xmath2 , and have garnered tremendous interest in condensed - matter physics , material science and electrical engineering communities@xmath3 .",
    "recent experimental realizations of ti states in compounds like @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 fueled further enthusiasm in their possible application in devices .",
    "the dirac cones on the surface of 3-dimensional tis are reminiscent of the dirac cones in 2-dimensional graphene , another exotic material which has attracted considerable attention@xmath7 .",
    "notably , graphene has been theoretically predicted@xmath8 and subsequently experimentally shown@xmath9 to exhibit strong nonlinear electromagnetic response owing to its unique linear dirac dispersion @xmath7 .    inspired by these properties of graphene",
    ", we ask if similar , if not more desirable , nonlinear behavior is also present in the tis . as we will show in this work ,",
    "the answer is in the affirmative : in fact , the response curve of tis is even more nonlinear , with an exotic regime of negative differential resistance that persists even in the absence of a strictly linear dispersion .",
    "more precisely , the response curve takes the form of an n shape with negative differential resistance in the middle segment , similar to the shape of the response curve leading to the gunn effect in gaas@xmath10 , but due to a completely different physical mechanism .",
    "this suggests an array of potential optoelectronics applications beyond those of graphene and the gunn diode .",
    "the enhanced nonlinearity of the response of ti surface states can be understood as follows .",
    "a ti heterostructure has two conducting surfaces , the top and bottom surfaces , while a graphene sheet only has one .",
    "due to the existence of the substrate in the ti heterostructure , structural inversion symmetry has to be broken , leading to a breaking of the degeneracy of the two ti surface states which opens up a rashba - type spin splitting@xmath11 .",
    "this results in an unique dirac ring bandstructure which exhibits a much stronger nonlinear electromagnetic response than a dirac cone alone , thereby opening up a venue for interesting physics as well as potential applications .    in this work ,",
    "we model a ti heterostructure as a dirac ring system , and analytically and numerically study its semiclassical nonlinear response .",
    "we first consider the case of an ideal dirac ring , i.e. at zero mass gap , temperature and impurities .",
    "next we consider deviations from these ideal conditions , and crucially show that the characteristic features of the response curve remain robust .",
    "we further discuss how this semiclassical analysis can be generalized to a more general setting with scattering and/or rashba - like dispersion , and its implications for the output signal .",
    "finally , we discuss some experimental proposals and engineering applications .",
    "we first introduce some basic theory on the semi - classical electromagnetic response of a generic hamiltonian . with that , we present our main results on the characteristic nonlinear response curve of dirac ring systems .",
    "such systems have been detected in the surface states of thin films of @xmath12 tis via arpes experiments@xmath11 , and we will return to discussing the experimental signatures of our results after developing its theory .      consider a generic system described by a hamiltonian @xmath13 under the influence of a driving field @xmath14 . at the semi - classical level , the field shifts the crystal momenta @xmath15 of the partially occupied bands , leading to an induced current @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the canonical velocity and @xmath18 is the eigenenergy for a particular band .",

    "henceforth , we shall work in units where @xmath31 and @xmath32 for notational simplicity .",
