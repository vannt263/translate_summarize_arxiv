    "for decades now , it has been well established that pne are the result of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars ( m@xmath4 10 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "the actual nebular formation process has been well understood since kwok , purton & fitzgerald ( 1978 ) explained the formation of pn as the result of the interaction of a low density fast wind with a high density slow wind .",
    "the only drawback of this _ two wind _",
    "model is that it can not explain well the formation of asymmetric pne . since it has been long observed that most pne do not have a round , regular shape , some other mechanism has to be invoked to produce asymmetry .",
    "mellema & frank ( 1995 ) implemented an interacting wind model with an equatorial density enhancement .",
    "the fast low density wind interacts with an azimuthal dependent wind forming an asymmetrical pn .",
    "rotation as a way to produce asymmetric pne has been proposed by different authors ( e.g. calvet & peimbert 1983 ; ignace , cassinelli & bjorkman 1996 ; garca - segura 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field is also able to convey an asymmetrical nebular evolution ( e.g. pascoli 1992 ; chevalier & luo 1994 ; soker 1998 ; garca - segura 1999 ) .",
    "the common envelope evolutionary phase , typical of a close binary star , also produces the appropriate equatorial density enhancement to make the pn ejecta asymmetric ; a similar effect can be obtained by the presence of a substellar object in the system ( e.g. soker 1997 ) .    by correlating the morphological class with the different nebular and stellar parameters , it may be possible to disclose the predominant mechanism responsible for the observed morphology .",
    "morphological studies of pne have lacked a univocal classification scheme . since the pioneer work by curtis ( 1918 ) , who discovered large structured `` haloes '' around some pne",
    ", there have been several studies all aimed at the same goal : a better understanding on the physical meaning of nebular shapes .",
    "greig ( 1971 ) classified pne into 15 morphological classes , ultimately grouped in two main classes : binebulous and circular ; he found that binebulous pne have lower galactic height distribution than circular pne ( greig 1972 ) .",
    "zuckerman & aller ( 1986 ) studied a sample of 108 pne , classifying them into 16 morphological types , then regrouped the many classes into bipolar , elliptical , round , irregular , and other shapes ; 50 % of their pn sample was bipolar , 30 % elliptical , 15 % round , and the rest irregular or other shapes .",
    "zuckermann & aller ( 1986 ) could not find any correlation between the morphological class and the c / o abundance .",
    "balick ( 1987 ) divided the morphological classes in round , elliptical , and butterfly .",
    "he proposed an evolutionary sequence within each morphological type .",
    "chu , jacoby & arendt ( 1987 ) , studied a sample of 126 extended pne .",
    "they found that the frequence of multiple - shell planetary nebulae ( mspn ) was 50 % .",
    "schwarz , corradi & stanghellini ( 1993 ) classified the schwarz , corradi & melnick ( 1992 ) sample of southern galactic pne into elliptical , bipolar , pointsymmetric , irregular , and stellar shapes . on a subsample of the same catalog of pne , stanghellini , corradi & schwarz ( 1993 ) found that the central star distribution was different for bipolar and elliptical pne .",
    "corradi & schwarz ( 1995 ) , using a large pn sample ( @xmath6 400 pne ) , found a different galactic height distribution for elliptical ( z=320 pc ) and for bipolar ( z=130 pc ) pne .",
    "most of these classification schemes are based on incomplete or inhomogeneous samples . on this basis , manchado ( 1996 ) presented a complete set of northern galactic pne , to be analyzed for their morphological properties . in @xmath72",
    "we will illustrate this sample ; we also discuss the completeness and the morphological classification based on the sample .",
    "@xmath7 3 presents some of the relations found between the morphology and other nebular and stellar parameters , and includes a discussion on the possible evolutionary scheme for the different types of pointsymmetric pne .",
    "conclusions are in @xmath7 4 .",
    "the selection criteria for our homogeneous sample of northern galactic pne includes : ( 1 ) all northern pne with declination larger than 11 in the acker ( 1992 ) catalog ; ( 2 ) all the pne larger than 4 arc - second ; ( 3 ) images must be obtained in the narrow band filters ( e.g. h@xmath8 , [ n ii ] or ) .",
    "there are 255 pne that fulfill these selection criteria , 205 from the survey by manchado ( 1996 ) , 28 from balick ( 1987 ) and 22 from schwarz , corradi & melnick ( 1992 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show a selection of these images , representative of the various morphologies .    after a thorough analysis of the whole sample we decided to revise the morphological classification by manchado ( 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , to make the individual morphological classes statistically meaningful , we decided to make only three major morphological classes : round ( 63 cases ) , elliptical ( 149 cases ) , and bipolar ( 43 cases ) pne .",
    "the quadrupolar pne ( 7 cases ) were included in the bipolar class , because the formation mechanisms could be very similar ( manchado , stanghellini & guerrero 1996 ) .",
    "pointsymmetry can be defined as a sub - class of elliptical and bipolar pne : in fact , most pointsymmetric pne have either bipolar or elliptical main shapes .",
    "a typical case of an elliptical pointsymmetric pne is a pn with fliers ( e.g. balick 1993 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a diagram with the new morphological scheme .",
    "although the sample is complete as far as known pne are concerned , there may be observational biases due to a different surface brightness limit for each morphological class . in order to investigate this possible bias",
    "we compare the statistical distribution of each morphological class taking into account the distance ( cahn , kaler & stanghellini 1992 ) and the extinction ( cahn , kaler & stanghellini 1992 ; tylenda 1992 ) .",
    "the overall distribution of morphology in our pn sample is 58 % elliptical , 25 % round and 17 % bipolar .",
    "however , we realized that the sample is only complete up to a distance of 7 kpc for all the morphological classes .",
    "if we were to limit the statistical studies to those pne within a distance of 7 kpc , the morphological distribution would be like 61 % elliptical , 26 % round and 13 % bipolar .",
    "it can be argued that the statistical distances are not correct , so we used the extinction to infer completeness .",
    "if the sample is confined to the galactic plane , we can assume an extinction distance relationship of c = 0.2 per kpc .",
    "therefore , if we limit the sample to pne with @xmath9 4@xmath10 , c must be @xmath4 1 . in this newly defined space volume",
    ", we find 59 % elliptical , 28 % round , and 13 % bipolar pne .",
    "therefore , the results obtained using the statistical distance and the extinction rule are very similar , which means that the completeness within this space volume is sound .",
    "each morphological class was correlated with a set of nebular and stellar parameters from the literature ( for a complete reference list , see manchado 2000 ) .",
    "it was found that electronic density has different values for each morphological class ; the median value is 1500 @xmath11 for elliptical , 400 @xmath11 for round , and 1000 @xmath11 for bipolar .",
    "dust temperatures were derived using the iras 25 and 60 @xmath12 fluxes and dust emissivities taken from draine & lee ( 1984 ) . both elliptical and round pne",
    "have a median dust temperature of 82 k , while bipolar temperature is 69 k.    the [ n ii]/h@xmath8 ratio is higher for bipolar than for elliptical and round pne .",
    "the n / o and he abundances of bipolar pne are consistent with type i pne ( as defined by peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ) and in mspn they are consistent with type ii pne .",
    "the galactic latitude distribution is different for each morphological class .",
    "the median of the galactic latitude is @xmath13 for elliptical , @xmath012 for round and @xmath14 for bipolar pne .",
    "figure 3 shows the galactic distribution of these three morphological classes .",
    "the median values of the galactic height are @xmath1308 pc for elliptical , @xmath1753 pc for round , and @xmath1179 pc for bipolar .    by studying the pointsymmetric pne",
    ", we find that for elliptical pointsymmetric the scale height is @xmath1310 pc , while the elliptical pne without pointsymmetry have a @xmath1 308 pc .",
    "bipolar with pointsymmetric structure have @xmath15248 pc , while bipolar without pointsymmetry @xmath1110 pc .",
    "the different galactic height for the various morphological classes may imply a different stellar population . according to miller & scalo ( 1979 )",
    "@xmath1300 pc implies that the progenitor star has mass @xmath4 1.0 m@xmath5 . for @xmath1150 pc ,",
    "the mass is @xmath16 1.5 m@xmath5 , while for @xmath1230 pc and @xmath1 110 pc masses will be @xmath16 1.2 m@xmath5 and @xmath16 1.9 m@xmath5 .",
    "therefore elliptical and bipolar pne might have different distribution masses for their progenitor stars ( @xmath4 1.0 m@xmath5 and @xmath16 1.5 m@xmath5 ) . in the bipolar class",
    "there is also a mass segregation .",
    "in fact , according to to their scale height on the galactic plane , pne with pointsymmetric structure evolve from stellar masses @xmath16 1.2 m@xmath5 , while those without the pointsymmetric structure evolve from stellar masses @xmath16 1.5 m@xmath5 .",
    "these results are consistent with the other results from our statistical analysis , as bipolar pne have higher n / o and helium abundances .",
    "the fact that two different mass distributions can be inferred for bipolar pne , depending on the presence of pointsymmetry , can be explained with two evolutionary schemes for the two types : a single , high mass star would form a bipolar pne , due possibly to rotation and magnetic field ( e.g. garca - segura 1999 ) , while a bipolar pointsymmetric pn could be due to magnetic collimation around a precessing star ( e.g. garca - segura 1997 ) .",
    "a proper statistical analysis of a complete sample of pne has allowed us to classify them into elliptical , round , and bipolar , with the sub - classes of multiple - shell and pointsymmetric pne .",
    "it was found that 60 % of our pn sample present an elliptical shape , while 26 % are round , and 13 % bipolar .",
    "we use statistical distances that appear to be sound for the task . if they are indeed correct , the different scale heights that characterize each morphological class hint of different progenitor mass distribution for each class . two evolutionary schemes are proposed for bipolar pne and bipolar pne with pointsymmetric structure .",
