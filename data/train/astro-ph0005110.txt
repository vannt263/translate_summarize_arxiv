    "we predict the temporal evolution of the surface properties of rotating massive stars .",
    "this is of particular interest , as it allows a direct comparison of these models with observations .    besides abundance changes , lifetime and evolution in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram of rotating stars differ from those of non - rotating stars",
    "this is particularly interesting for age determinations of young stellar clusters . since appropriate sets of rotating stellar models",

    "a list of our initial models and the evolution of stellar structure and angular momentum in the stellar interior are given in @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the observable stellar properties , which is the topic of the present paper , is divided in two major parts : the main - sequence evolution (  [ sec : hburn ] ) and the post - main sequence evolution (  [ sec : posth ] ) . in  [ sec : obs ] we compare our results to observations and give our conclusions in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "[ sec : hburn ]    core hydrogen burning comprises about @xmath5 of the total stellar lifetime and is therefore the evolutionary phase which can be most easily compared with observations .",

    "this deviates distinctly from typical initial ratios of about @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "most of the initial carbon and oxygen is converted into n. a subcycle of the cno process , which transforms the initial o into n , passes through f and o and is responsible for the production of o. further characteristic properties of the cno cycle are the production of c and the destruction of n.    in the stellar layers above the convective core the cno equilibrium abundances are not reached . in particular , there is almost no processing of hydrogen into helium .",
    "however , isotopes which are produced at lower temperatures than where they are destroyed ( e.g. , c and o ) can have abundance maxima in the envelope .",
    "other nuclear cycles occurring during hydrogen burning involve , e.g. , neon , sodium , magnesium , and aluminum .",
    "they do not contribute significantly to the energy generation , but they do alter the abundances of the involved isotopes . as the abundance changes of different isotopes occur at different temperatures , measuring their abundances at the stellar surface may contribute additional information about the mixing processes in the stellar interior .",
    "the light isotopes 3he , 6li , 7li , 9be , b , and b are destroyed at the low temperature in the stellar envelope .",

    "mixing is efficient ( fig .",

    "therefore , a stronger enrichment of nitrogen close to the surface results in model e20b , due mainly to the processing of carbon into nitrogen .",
    "the o abundance in the envelope hardly changes in model e20b , because the temperature above the @xmath15-barrier is never high enough to allow for its processing .",
    "helium , being the main reason for the @xmath15-barrier , remains small in the envelope .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - d - e15ab ] _ _ we show the total diffusion coefficient as resulting from all mixing processes taken into account at the beginning , about the middle , and the end of central hydrogen burning for models e15 and e15b . for model",
    "e15b the @xmath15-barrier can be seen a deep drop in the diffusion coefficient above the convective core at the two later times , while the @xmath15-barrier is not yet present at the beginning of core hydrogen burning ( solid line ) . in model e15",
    "such a @xmath15-barrier never forms , since the rotationally induced mixing is assumed insensitive to @xmath15-gradients , and thus material from the core can be mixed up to the surface during whole central hydrogen burning .",
    "however , note that the diffusion coefficient by rotationally induced mixing processes , dominated by eddington - sweet circulation in the envelope , is lower by a factor three compared to model e15b , since @xmath19 is lower by this factor .",
    "therefore , also the time - scale for mixing in the envelope is longer by that factor .",
    "[ sec : h - light ]    the light elements , which are already destroyed at the rather low temperatures in the upper part of the envelope , allow to study the mixing close to the surface .",
    "lithium is the most fragile and destroyed first , closely followed by beryllium . at somewhat higher temperatures , boron follows , and further in , more than five solar masses below the surface in the @xmath11 models , the destruction of 3he proceeds ( fig .  [ fig : m - x3 - 20ab ]",
    "_ _ ) .    in non - rotating stars ,",
    "the isotopes are just destroyed `` in place '' wherever the temperature gets high enough , while at lower temperatures , i.e. , closer to the surface , they are not altered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - x3 - 20ab ] _ _ ) .",
    "thus their surface abundance during central hydrogen burning changes only if mass loss is sufficiently strong to remove the unaltered layers .",
    "this is the case in model d20 for lithium and beryllium . due to the strong temperature dependence of the destruction rates",
    ", the resulting abundance changes can become quite dramatic .",
    "though model d25 experiences more mass loss than model d20 , its envelope is more extended and a more massive surface layer can preserve the initial stellar abundances till the end of central hydrogen burning  enough to result in lower depletion of lithium and beryllium then model d20 .    in rotating stars , however , rotationally induced mixing causes a downward transport of the light elements .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "first , the light elements are transported into regions where the temperature is sufficiently high to destroy them .",
    "this leads to a depletion of these isotopes by the rotating massive stars during central hydrogen burning .",
    "the faster the mixing in the envelope , the stronger the depletion .",
    "secondly , due to mass loss and expansion of the stars during central hydrogen burning , envelope layers which have been hot enough to destroy the light elements cool down , and the rotationally induced mixing can enrich these layers again with the residual of the light elements in the layers above before these outer layers get lost by winds .",
    "that is , some of the light isotopes can actually be _ preserved _  to a small extent  by the rotationally induced mixing ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : m - x3 - 20ab]_a _ for lithium ) .",
    "we denote this effect as _ rotationally reduced depletion_.    obviously , these two effects compete with each other . as long as mass loss",
    "is not large enough to remove most of the unprocessed matter from the surface , both the surface abundance and the total mass of the corresponding isotope will be higher in the non - rotating star .",
    "but if mass loss is great enough to remove all the unprocessed matter of a non - rotating star , the rotating model can , for the same amount of mass loss , actually retain both a higher total mass and surface mass fraction of the fragile isotope .    in the models of series `` b '' , where the mixing in the envelope is relatively fast , the destruction due to the mixing of the light elements into hot layers dominates .",
    "this effect increases with initial angular momentum , and it can destroy lithium , beryllium , and boron almost completely , and reduce 3he by more than a factor ten , even at the surface .",
    "nuclear processing of the stable isotopes of neon , sodium , magnesium , and aluminum occurs only in the hot convective core of the star , i.e. , below the @xmath15-barrier . in the core , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are converted to @xmath22 by the reaction @xmath20(@xmath23,@xmath24)@xmath25(@xmath26@xmath27)@xmath21(@xmath23,@xmath24)@xmath22 .",
    "thus a depletion of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is accompanied by an enrichment of @xmath22 .",
    "the long - lived radioactive isotope @xmath28 is produced from @xmath29 by proton capture , but decays by electron capture to @xmath30 with a lifetime of @xmath31 .",
    "the processing of @xmath30 to @xmath32 leads to a slight enrichment of this aluminum isotope , but it is unimportant for @xmath30 .",
    "the abundances of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are essentially unaffected .",
    "no sodium or @xmath28 enrichment was found in the envelope of the non - rotating model d20 , but strong abundance gradients of these species exist inside the envelope of the rotating model e20 ( inefficient @xmath15-barriers ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : m - x2 - 20ab ] _ _ ) , and a slight enrichment is even found at the surface . in model",
    "e20b the @xmath15-gradient is weak enough to allow efficient transport of these processed isotopes from the core into the envelope only during the early phase of hydrogen burning . in particular",
    ", the rapid conversion of @xmath21 to @xmath22 at hydrogen ignition allows it to be mixed into the envelope before the formation of the @xmath15-barrier . due to the more efficient mixing inside the envelope , @xmath22 is even more enriched at the surface than in model e20 , even though its total mass inside the envelope is much less .",
    "similar processes occur for the other isotopes of the neon / sodium and the magnesium / aluminum cycles .    the strength of enrichment of nuclear processed matter increases with initial mass @xcite .",
    "several effects contribute : with increasing stellar mass the stellar interior becomes increasingly dominated by radiation pressure , and the radiative zone of the star is closer to the adiabatic stratification , which , for example , increases the velocity of the eddington - sweet circulation @xcite .",
    "additionally , the convective core comprises a larger fraction of the total stellar mass and mass loss increases . both help to bring processed matter to the surface of the star .",
    "[ sec : hburnhrd ]    at core hydrogen ignition , a rotating star behaves , in some respect , as if it had less mass .",
    "it is less luminous @xcite , i.e. , burns hydrogen at a lower rate , and ages slower .",
    "this is due to the reduction of the effective gravity by the centrifugal force @xcite . at the same time , the radius of a rotating star is larger than that of a non - rotating star of same mass .",
    "therefore , it appears in the hr diagram at lower effective temperature . this can be seen in figs .",

    "however , rotationally induced mixing increases the average mean molecular weight in the star by enriching the envelope in helium (  [ sec : hnucenv ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of enrichment depends upon the inhibiting effect of @xmath15-gradients and on initial angular momentum of the star @xcite . in chemically homogeneous stars , @xmath35 @xcite",
    "that is , an increasing helium enrichment makes rotating stars to evolve at higher luminosity which can exceed the luminosity of a non - rotating star of same initial mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ms - hrd-12ab ] _ _ ) .",
    "the higher luminosity also causes the convective core to recede less or even to grow @xcite .    for faster initial rotation ,",
    "the stars tend to live longer . at the beginning of hydrogen burning",
    "they are less luminous due to the reduced effective gravity , and use their fuel supply more sparingly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_e1-e3 _ ) . only at later times",
    "they evolve to higher luminosities because of the higher average mean molecular weight @xcite , but at the same time they have a larger fuel supply and larger convective cores .",
    "this latter effect is analogous to the effect of `` convective core overshooting '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the helium enrichment in the envelope can also cause the star to evolve to higher surface temperatures , and therefore to a position in the hr diagram where less evolved non - rotating stars of higher initial mass would be located @xcite .",
    "these trends are demonstrated in fig .",

    "the mixing efficiency is smaller in the former models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models ,",
    "the mixing occurs continuously without any hindrance by a @xmath15-barrier (  [ sec : mixhmu ] ) and the stars gradually evolve towards higher luminosities compared to non - rotating stars .",
    "they reach the end of central hydrogen burning at higher luminosities for higher zams rotational velocity .",
    "as the fastest rotators remain close to uniform rotation , model f12 hits the @xmath37-limit of critical rotation @xcite at the end of central hydrogen burning .",
    "therefore , it can not contract and move back to higher temperatures before the `` turn - off '' , like the other models shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ms - hrd-12ab]_a_. the same occurs for model h15b .    in the case where rotationally induced mixing is sensitive to @xmath15-gradients ,",
    "the envelope helium enrichment is only weak for the slowly rotating models ( @xmath38 ) , since the @xmath15-barrier becomes effective early on .",
    "these stars evolve very similar to the non - rotating models . in the faster rotating models ( see models f12b and h12b in fig .  [",
    "fig : ms - hrd-12ab]_b _ ) the rotationally induced mixing initially operates efficiently enough to penetrate the growing @xmath15-barrier .",
    "the stars evolve to higher luminosities and surface temperatures for some time and follow , in the hd diagram , a track almost perpendicular to the evolution of the non - rotating model d12 . during this time",
    ", their convective core mass remains about constant or even grows ( in model h12b ) .",
    "eventually , the @xmath15-barrier becomes strong enough to suppress the rotationally induced mixing , and the stars continue their evolution in the hr diagram parallel to that of the non - rotating model , but at a higher luminosity .",
    "this `` @xmath15-turn '' occurs the later the higher the initial rotational velocity is ( for a given initial mass ) .",
    "it also affects the evolution of the surface abundances (  [ sec : surfabu ] ) , because it marks the point where the chemical evolution of the envelope becomes disconnected from that of the core .",
    "very similar behavior is also found for the @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ms - hrd-15b ] _ _ ) and @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ms - hrd-20b ] _ _ ) stars .",
    "the effects described above are stronger for the fast - rotating stars of lower mass because those are closer to their critical rotation rate .",
    "additionally , the more massive stars are more dominated by radiation pressure in their interiors , and so helium enrichment affects them less .    as a result of these dependences of the stellar evolutionary tracks in the hr  diagram on the initial rotation rate , a given point in the hr diagram",
    "is not uniquely related to a single initial mass , even for core hydrogen burning stars .",
    "in contrast , stars which differ in initial mass _ and _ rotation rate can evolve to the same position ( fig .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the fast rotating models h12b and h15b share , at the end of their central hydrogen burning , the same position in the hr  diagram as the slowly rotating models of @xmath39 and @xmath11 ( figs .  [ fig : ms - hrd-12ab]_b _ , [ fig : ms - hrd-15b ] _ _ , and [ fig : ms - hrd-20b ] _ _ ) .",
    "the rotating models can also reach positions in the hr diagram to the right of the main sequence band of non - rotating stars , i.e. , the main sequence is broadened by the action of rotation .",
    "a distinguishing feature , however , between lower - mass fast rotators and higher - mass slow rotators which share the same position in the hr diagram , is the different evolutionary time they need to get to that position .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_e1-e3 _ : for example , the fast rotating model h12b reaches the same luminosity and also about the same surface temperature after @xmath40 , while the slowly rotating @xmath39 stars terminate central hydrogen burning at the same position already after only @xmath41 .",
    "another such distinguishing feature is the expected surface abundance pattern , which is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : surfabu ] .",
    "hot stars may become wolf - rayet stars with surface hydrogen mass fractions below @xmath42 , either due to mass loss or due to mixing @xcite . as mentioned above , stars with more internal mixing also have more mass loss due to their higher luminosity . as an example , the extremely rapidly rotating model h20b becomes a wolf - rayet star at a central hydrogen abundance of @xmath43 , i.e. , during central hydrogen burning ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ms - hrd-20b ] _ _ ) .",
    "thus , rotationally induced mixing can significantly influence the lower limiting initial mass required for wolf - rayet star formation during central hydrogen burning in single stars @xcite .",
    "[ sec : roth ]    the evolution of the surface rotational velocity for various models is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_d1-d3_. it is affected by several different contributions : first , the loss of angular momentum due to stellar winds leads to a slow - down of the star . for the models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_d1-d3 _ , this reduces the initial angular momentum of the @xmath11 models by @xmath44 , by @xmath45 for the @xmath39 models , and @xmath46 for the @xmath36 models .",
    "the second effect is the increase of the total moment of inertia of the star , for the stars considered here by about a factor two from core hydrogen ignition until shortly before core hydrogen exhaustion , due the expansion of the envelope . both the moment of inertia and the angular momentum of the models",
    "are dominated by the envelope , which stays close to uniform rotation .",
    "third , the increase of the stellar radius by about a factor two to three during core hydrogen burning leads to an increase of the surface rotational velocity of the stars by the same factor for a given angular velocity , @xmath47 .",
    "this effect almost completely cancels out the slowing down due to the two preceding effects , as can be seen from the small change in the surface rotational velocity in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_d1-d3_.    the rise in rotational velocity at the end of core hydrogen burning is due to the overall contraction of the star before ignition of hydrogen shell burning . the deep drop of the rotational velocity in model h20b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_d3 _ ) is caused by the angular momentum loss occurring as a consequence of the strong mass loss as it becomes a wolf - rayet star .",
    "[ fig : t - cnovl]_d1 _ ) reaches the @xmath37-limit @xcite at the end of core hydrogen burning , and therefore strong anisotropic mass loss is expected in this case @xcite .",
    "[ sec : surfabu ]    the efficiencies of the rotationally induced mixing in our models have been calibrated @xcite such that the _ average _ surface abundance trends for helium and cno abundances on the main sequence are consistent with the observations . however , the enrichment or depletion of these elements as a function of rotation rate , time , and initial mass were not adjusted .",
    "also , the surface abundances of the rare helium and cno isotopes , as well as the abundances of all other elements were not considered in the calibration process .",
    "it is thus essential for a comparison with observations to also investigate the surface abundances of our models during the main sequence phase .",
    "an important feature of rotationally induced mixing is the depletion of light elements , like lithium and boron , at the surface .",
    "these elements are destroyed at much lower temperatures than those necessary for cno processing .",
    "therefore , much stronger abundance changes are induced by rotation .",

    "even the slow rotators with zams rotational velocities of @xmath49 , which barely show any nitrogen enrichment , become depleted in boron by @xmath50 .    at the end of central hydrogen burning",
    ", the non - rotating model d20 shows a lithium depletion which is more than two orders of magnitude greater than that of the slowly rotating model g20 .",
    "this is due to the rotationally reduced depletion (  [ sec : h - light ] ) . in a similar way , model e20 , where the efficiency of the mixing in the envelope is less than in model e20b , experiences less destruction of lithium than model d20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m - x3 - 20ab]_a _ ) .",

    "that is , the envelope is already well - mixed before the dredge - up .    since , during the dredge - up , the convective envelope penetrates into regions which were located below the @xmath15-barrier , the surface carbon mass fraction is reduced by diluting the c in the envelope with the c - depleted matter from deeper inside the star . in a similar way , o is depleted and 4he is enriched",
    ". the bottom of the convective envelope does not get hot enough for nuclear burning , i.e. , the abundance changes at the surface during the dredge - up result only from mixing of already processed matter into the convective envelope as it extends to lower mass coordinates",
    ".    in the case of rotationally induced mixing , conversion of c into n occurs above the @xmath15-barrier and therefore the composition of matter originally located close to the surface of the stars can be altered by first mixing it down , then processing it , and mixing it up again .",
    "due to this , the surface enrichment in the faster rotating stars is stronger , both before and after the dredge - up , than in the slowly or non - rotating stars .",
    "the stronger depletion of o and enrichment of 4he for the faster rotating stars is mainly because in those the rotationally induced mixing can overcome the @xmath15-barrier for a longer time during core hydrogen burning than in the slow rotators .",

    "however , in most of the models considered here , the convective envelope does not penetrate much deeper during the second dredge - up than it did during the first dredge - up . additionally , not much mixing occurs in the radiative part of the envelope during core helium burning , and the temperatures are mostly too low for significant thermonuclear processing .",
    "thus , with the exception of the lowest masses ( e.g. , models d10 and e08 ) , no strong changes in the surface abundances occur during the second dredge - up . in stars which experience a blue loop",
    ", the processing can be slightly stronger , since during this loop the envelope contracts and a larger part of it can become sufficiently hot for thermonuclear reactions to occur .",
    "the surface abundances of the most important isotopes after the second dredge - up are given in table  [ tab:2nd ] .",
    "since in the case of the second dredge - up the mixing in the convective envelope is also fast enough to make it chemically homogeneous , table  [ tab:2nd ] gives the presupernova abundances of the entire envelope .",
    "[ sec : rotvel ]    the majority of the stellar models investigated here expand to red supergiants after core hydrogen depletion .",
    "the expansion of the stellar envelope increases the moment of inertia and the angular velocity of the rigidly rotating convective envelope of the star decreases considerably .",
    "this is the most important effect contributing to the slow - down of the star s rotation when evolving from the main sequence to the red supergiant regime . additionally , strong mass loss sets in during the red supergiant phase , and",
    "the corresponding loss of angular momentum due to stellar winds becomes important .",
    "this is also true for the models of lower initial mass , in which angular momentum loss was almost negligible during central hydrogen burning . since the rise of the moment of inertia is much larger than the growth in radius @xcite , the surface rotational velocity decreases considerably and drops below @xmath71 in most models ( table  [ tab : rot ] , fig .",

    "i.e. , after core helium exhaustion , the models become even more luminous and extended ( table  [ tab : rot ] ) .    models with an initial mass of @xmath36 or below , experiencing a blue loop , show a remarkable spin - up during this phase and can lose the major part of their total angular momentum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this explains the small difference in the angular velocity of the @xmath36 models compared to the corresponding @xmath39 models , which do not develop blue loops , in relation to the differences between other models with same input physics but different initial mass ( see e.g. , models e12b , e15b , and e20b in table  [ tab : rot ] ) .",
    "blue supergiants born out of such a transition can rotate close to their critical rotation rate .",
    "this fast rotation occurs because the envelope angular momentum is concentrated in a small mass fraction at the surface of the star .",
    "due to mass loss the rapidly rotating layers get lost soon and the star slows down quickly ( see * ? ? ?",
    "model h12b evolves as a blue supergiant during the first part of core helium burning .",
    "since it has a large initial angular momentum and does not experience any significant previous angular momentum loss , it evolves close to critical rotation during this phase .",
    "even the enhancement of the mass loss rate due to rotation does not cause a sufficiently high angular momentum loss to slow it down from critical rotation",
    ".    models e25 and h20b become wolf - rayet stars during central helium burning . the evolution of model e25 has been followed until core collapse .",
    "the strong mass loss during the wolf - rayet phase rapidly slows down the rotation of the helium envelope .",
    "none of the instabilities considered in the present work is fast enough to keep it in rigid rotation with the core or the rest of the helium - rich layers .",
    "thus strong differential rotation occurs in the envelope and the core is not slowed down significantly .",

    "nevertheless , some tentative support for a positive correlation of enrichment and rotation comes from @xcite and @xcite , although other interpretations of the observational data appear possible as well .",

    "@xcite interpreted the boron depletion in b  stars which at the same time are not enriched in nitrogen as evidence for rotational mixing .",
    "there is also evidence from more evolved luminous stars supporting the scenario of rotational mixing of the kind obtained by our models .",
    "however , an additional problem appears in this case , namely that  for stars in the mass range considered here  the post main sequence radius or temperature evolution can not yet be reliably predicted by stellar evolution theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is often not unambiguous which fraction of an abundance anomaly in an evolved massive star might be attributed to a possible previous convective dredge - up which would have occurred were the star a red supergiant in the past .",
    "however , @xcite has analyzed abundances in galactic and magellanic cloud a  supergiants and found results which are incompatible with standard evolution with or without red supergiant dredge - up but rather call for an additional enrichment process like rotationally induced mixing .",
    "further abundance anomalies which might be related to rotational mixing are the strong signature of cno processing in the progenitor of sn  1987a @xcite , small c / c - ratios in red giants @xcite , sodium enrichment in cool supergiants @xcite , and simultaneous carbon and nitrogen enrichment in several wolf - rayet stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "while perhaps none of the quoted observational evidences is completely convincing by itself , their huge amount gives strong support for the idea that a non - standard ( i.e. , non - convective ) enrichment process must in fact operate in massive stars . as the rotational mixing during core hydrogen burning can also increase the luminosity - to - mass ratio , the so called mass discrepancy , i.e. , the finding that masses of massive main sequence stars derived through spectroscopy or by constraints from radiation driven wind models are on average smaller than masses derived from stellar evolutionary tracks ( cf .",

    "the only scenario presently competing with the rotational mixing scenario is that of close binary mass transfer .",

    "in particular , the cno pattern , and the helium and sodium enhancements are found to be very similar . moreover , those binary components which accrete significant amounts of mass from their companion end up in rather wide orbits , with companions of much lower mass . that is , after the supernova explosions of the companions",
    ", the accretion stars may not be easily recognizable by a large space velocity . due to the accretion of angular momentum they might also be rapid rotators , which may lead to a positive correlation of enrichment and rotational velocity .    nevertheless , we identify two distinguishing characteristics of the rotation and the binary enrichment scenarios .",
    "first , as already anticipated by @xcite , boron depleted main sequence stars which are _ not _ nitrogen enriched are only produced by rotation .",
    "while @xcite used estimates to exclude such abundance pattern for the binary scenario , this is now confirmed in detail by the recent grid of binary models of @xcite .",
    "second , the rotational mixing scenario predicts a stronger enrichment for more luminous stars ( see above ) .",
    "in contrast , the binary models of @xcite and @xcite , which cover a luminosity range of @xmath77 , do not show this trend .    as there is empirical evidence for both distinguishing predictions of the rotational mixing scenario ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the contribution of the binary scenario seems not to be the dominant one .",
    "however , more observations are clearly needed to prove its significance .",
    "we suggest that in particular the combined study of boron and cno elements in hot stars will allow to draw more stringent conclusions , and that a simultaneous derivation of the rotational and also of the radial velocities would be very valuable to provide further clues as to the relative importance of the mass transfer and the rotational mixing scenario for an understanding of the multitude of abundance peculiarities in massive stars .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of the surface properties of models for rotating massive stars , i.e. , their luminosities , effective temperatures , surface rotational velocities , and surface abundances of all isotopes , from the zero age main sequence to the supernova stage . </S>",
    "<S> our results are based on the grid of stellar models by @xcite , which covers solar metallicity stars in the initial mass range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> results are parameterized by initial mass , initial rotational velocity and major uncertainties in the treatment of the rotational mixing inside massive stars .    </S>",
    "<S> rotationally induced mixing processes widen the main sequence and increase the core hydrogen burning lifetime , similar to the effects of convective overshooting . </S>",
    "<S> it can also significantly increase the luminosity during and after core hydrogen burning , and strongly affects the evolution of the effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our models predict surface rotational velocities for various evolutionary stages , in particular for blue supergiants , red supergiants , and for the immediate presupernova stage .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the changes of the surface abundances due to rotationally induced mixing for main sequence and post main sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> we single out two characteristics by which the effect of rotational mixing can be distinguished from that of massive close binary mass transfer , the only alternative process leading to non - standard chemical surface abundances in massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with observed abundance anomalies in various types of massive stars supports the concept of rotational mixing in massive stars and indicates that it is responsible for most of the observed abundance anomalies . </S>"
