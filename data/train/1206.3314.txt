    "magnetism is an important component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) : it contributes to gas pressure to balance it against gravity , achieving hydrostatic equilibrium ; it helps to remove angular momentum from a collapsing molecular cloud , allowing star formation to proceed ; and it also confines and deflects cosmic rays . yet",
    ", we still do not understand the details of processes that generate large - scale coherent galactic magnetic fields , especially those in regions outside the galactic disk .",
    "the existence of large - scale magnetic fields in galactic disks can be explained by the classical mean - field dynamo  the amplification of magnetic fields by small - scale turbulent motion ( the @xmath9-effect ) and differential rotation ( the @xmath10-effect ) on a time scale of 10@xmath11 years @xcite . according to dynamo theory , an axisymmetric magnetic field with quadrupole symmetry ( even parity ) with respect to the galactic mid - plane is most readily excited in the disk .",
    "this is found to be the case for the milky way ",

    "dynamo modes excited in the thick disks or halos of galaxies can have dipolar symmetry ( odd parity ) with respect to the galactic disk .",
    "these modes could also be oscillatory , resulting in large - scale transient magnetic field reversals @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to establish the halo field symmetry with respect to the galactic plane even in the most well - studied edge - on galaxy , ngc 253 .",
    "@xcite found that a large - scale magnetic field model of an axisymmetric spiral form plus an out - of - plane quadrupole extension that could reproduce polarization patterns observed in a number of face - on galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the backside halos in their target galaxies were severely depolarized and the field symmetry with respect to the mid - plane could not be determined .",
    "disk and halo fields could be of different axial geometries : for example , m 51 ( inclination of @xmath420@xmath0 ) was found to have a bisymmetric halo field and an axisymmetric disk field @xcite .",
    "characterizing the halo magnetic field symmetry in our own milky way is even more challenging because of our location within it .",
    "early works based on a sparsely sampled all - sky faraday rotation measure ( rm ) distribution of pulsars and extragalactic sources ( egss ) have suggested a dipolar - type galactic halo magnetic field @xcite . however , using the rm of @xmath12 1,000 extragalactic sources , @xcite demonstrated that the milky way s vertical magnetic field at the location of the sun is of neither quadrupolar nor dipolar symmetry .",
    "more recently , @xcite used rms of diffuse polarized galactic synchrotron emission to show that the egs rm pattern thought to be the signature of a dipolar halo field is at least partly due to a local magnetized shell . clearly , further effort is needed to properly describe the geometry of the galactic halo magnetic field .    in this paper , we characterize the symmetry of the galactic halo magnetic field by studying rms of egss in the region 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 , @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath330@xmath0 ( towards the perseus arm ) .",

    "we construct a simple galactic halo field model in section  [ vlasubsection : b_toy_model ] that can successfully reproduce the general observed rm trend in the surveyed area .",
    "to directly measure the parity of the milky way s disk and halo magnetic field in a latitude strip , we extend the latitude coverage of the cgps latitude extension region by conducting an egs rm survey with the vla . we construct a magnetic field model for the milky way to estimate the number of sources needed for such a detection .",
    "we assume the milky way has a symmetric 1 @xmath8 g disk field with a scale height of 1 kpc and an antisymmetric 1 @xmath8 g halo field with a scale height of 4 kpc .",

    "the difference in rm for sight lines above and below the plane becomes pronounced at @xmath1b@xmath1@xmath1415@xmath0 .",
    "magneto - ionic structures along the sight lines toward the outer galaxy are less complex than those towards the inner galaxy as the former only pass through one major spiral arm : the perseus arm . for this reason and because of the high angular density of rm measurements in our new sample at 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 , the symmetry properties of the disk field can be revealed by plotting rm against @xmath2 ( figure  [ vlafig : rm_vs_b ] ) without needing to apply wavelet analysis @xcite or averaging algorithms @xcite .",
    "the signs of rm above and below the disk within @xmath12 15@xmath0 of the galactic plane are the same , implying that towards the outer galaxy , the plane - parallel disk magnetic field preserves its direction across the galactic mid - plane ( even parity ) , in agreement with previous works .",
    "this picture fits in well with our current understanding of the disk field origin : the dynamo mechanism predicts a symmetric disk field as it is the easiest mode to be excited ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite investigated the symmetry plane of the disk field by fitting a gaussian to the rm versus @xmath2 behavior using egs rms in the cgps latitude extension region which mostly probe sight lines above the plane ( latitude coverage @xmath43.5@xmath0@xmath3@xmath2@xmath3@xmath2318@xmath0 ) .",

    "the distance to the warp is estimated to be at least 5 kpc from the sun towards the outer galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our new vla observations provide egs rms towards negative latitudes in the same longitude range as the cgps data .",
    "this puts us at a position to re - examine results of @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , we center the rm distribution about the galactic disk by fitting a gaussian .",
    "the gaussian centroid fit is sensitive to the latitude range within which rms are fitted .",
    "we use @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1=10@xmath0 as the initial boundary of the fit since it is where the rm - vs-@xmath2 trend changes abruptly .",
    "this is likely because rms of egss at higher galactic latitudes are dominated by the galactic halo magnetic field which has a different vertical symmetry from the disk field .",
    "including rms at higher @xmath2 when fitting will then likely degrade the quality of the centroid fit .",
    "we vary the latitude boundary of the fit until the reduced @xmath20 of the gaussian fit is minimized .",
    "we found that the distribution of rotation measure is symmetric about @xmath2=@xmath40.13@xmath0@xmath50.48@xmath0 , with corresponding fit boundaries at @xmath2=@xmath522.15@xmath0 .",
    "this is different from the offset of the rm symmetry axis to positive @xmath2 reported in @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the limited galactic latitude coverage ( mostly above the galactic plane ) of the cgps data , and the fact that we have used a recently revised cgps rm catalogue , different from that used in @xcite .",
    "our findings of the rm symmetry with respect to the galactic mid - plane at low galactic latitude is in agreement with the conclusion reached by @xcite , who showed , using the scattering of egss , that the ionized galactic disk is not warped towards the outer galaxy .",
    "the fitted rm distribution has a width of 5.49@xmath0@xmath50.78@xmath0 : the @xmath1rm@xmath1 produced by the disk field is less than 5 rad m@xmath6 for @xmath7 @xmath1415@xmath0 .",
    "the symmetric rm behavior about the galactic plane within @xmath12 15@xmath0 is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "these authors used a smoothed all sky rm data set to show that the milky way s disk magnetic field stays symmetric about the mid - plane for @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath315@xmath0 .",
    "we note that translating this latitude boundary into a physical height below which the disk field dominates requires the knowledge of where along the line of sight most of the faraday rotation occurs .",
    "if we assume that most faraday rotation is mainly produced by magnetic fields and electrons in the perseus spiral arm at a distance of 2 kpc @xcite , then the disk magnetic field dominates within @xmath12 540 pc of the galactic plane .",
    "in this section , we investigate the rm behavior in our surveyed longitude range at 15@xmath0@xmath3@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath330@xmath0 .",
    "we first establish the location of the faraday rotating layer and then determine if structures in thermal electrons or in magnetic fields are responsible for producing the observed rms .",
    "finally , we construct a simple model of the galactic halo magnetic field to explain the observed rm trend as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "since faraday rotation is an integral from the egs to the observer , the observed rm could originate anywhere along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine where most of the faraday rotation takes place .",
    "the observed rm could be of extragalactic or galactic origin .",

    "since the mid - galactic latitude region in our vla survey does not coincide with extended galaxy clusters or superclusters , we rule out the possibility that the rms we measure toward the survey area are produced in the intracluster medium . as high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) can produce observable rms @xcite , we verified , by comparing maps of the high velocity neutral hydrogen sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite suggested that the unusually large and negative rm in region a is produced by loop ii .",
    "loop ii is thought to be the shell of a nearby ( @xmath12 100 pc ) supernova remnant expanding into the magnetized interstellar medium , as by @xcite and by @xcite . in their models , a shell of thickness 10 pc , with an electron density of 1.2 @xmath24 and a magnetic field strength of @xmath12",
    "10 @xmath8 g could produce rms of similar magnitudes to those observed within region a. however , one expects the thermal electrons in this shell to produce an emission measure of @xmath12 14 pc @xmath25 .",
    "this is inconsistent with wham observations : the mean emission measure in region a is roughly 2 pc @xmath25 , far smaller than the predicted value ( since region a is far outside the galactic plane , we expect little extinction ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no enhancement in h@xmath9 along the boundary of region a , that might correspond to limb - brightening .",
    "one alternative is that a magneto - ionic medium which is non - h@xmath9 emitting is responsible for producing the observed faraday rotation . @xcite",
    "considered the possibility that low energy relativistic electrons , which are not visible in h@xmath9 , produce the observed rm , but the estimated density of these low - energy cosmic rays was too low to explain the observed rm magnitude .",
    "@xcite further suggested that given the dimension of loop ii , the total energy injection requires multiple supernova explosions .",
    "it is unclear how magnetic fields can stay coherent on such a large area in the sky after a few of these violent events unless they produce a single coherent superbubble .",
    "we also note that the boundary of loop ii does not lie within our survey area .",
    "more recently , @xcite used rms derived from the nvss @xcite to revisit the possible connection between loop ii and region a. they argued that the rm sign - change from negative within to positive outside region a appears to coincide with the boundary of loop ii at @xmath13@xmath12160@xmath0 .",
    "this was taken as evidence by @xcite of a magnetic field reversal due to loop ii . upon close inspection , however , we find that positive rms outside region a near @xmath13@xmath12160@xmath0 is likely produced by ionized gas and magnetic fields in the hii region sh2 - 220 ( the california nebula ) and a more extended h@xmath9 emission region around it @xcite .",
    "the coherent magnetic field properties of sh2 - 220 have been investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the rm sign change is likely at least partly due to the presence of the hii region , rather than due to the absence of loop ii .",
    "finally , using rms towards pulsars in region a , @xcite reached the conclusion that faraday rotation along sight lines within region a must be produced at least 0.95 kpc away from the sun .",
    "this once again weakens the possible connection between region a and loop ii , the latter of which is thought to be located within @xmath12100 pc .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the negative rms that we see at mid - latitude below the galactic plane are likely not produced by local structures in the ism , but rather by larger scale structures located at least 1 kpc from the sun .",
    "our surveyed region above the galactic plane lies within the boundary of radio loop iii @xcite .",
    "although rms at the low galactic longitude edge of loop iii appear to be enhanced ( see  figure [ vlafig : rm_prediction_q2 ] ) , the rm distribution within loop iii itself does not appear to be anomalous .",
    "since rm is sensitive to magnetic field weighted by thermal electron density , an increase in egs rm could reflect either an increase in the average line - of - sight magnetic field strength , in the thermal electron density or in both quantities .",
    "if thermal electrons are responsible for producing the observed rm as @xcite argued , and the same thermal electrons also emit in h@xmath9 , then one can distinguish between rm due to an increase in line - of - sight magnetic field strength from that due to an increase in electron density by inspecting the distribution of h@xmath9 emission along the sight lines of interest .",
    "we found that for both local ( @xmath425 km s@xmath26@xmath3v@xmath27@xmath3@xmath2325 km s@xmath26 ) and perseus arm ( @xmath460 km s@xmath26@xmath3v@xmath27 @xmath3 @xmath440 km s@xmath26 ) ionized gas , the emission measure is distributed symmetrically about the galactic plane ",
    "there is comparable amount of thermal electrons at + 20@xmath0@xmath3@xmath2@xmath3 + 30@xmath0 as that towards @xmath430@xmath0@xmath3@xmath2@xmath3@xmath420@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the structure in rm is unlikely to be due to enhancements in thermal electrons .",
    "instead , it is likely that the observed rm in the surveyed region reflects changes in magnetic field structures .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that if the increase in rm was primarily due to an increased electron density , then the electron density would be a factor of 50 larger towards the southern galactic hemisphere than towards the northern galactic hemisphere ( this is roughly the ratio of @xmath1rm@xmath1 at @xmath2=@xmath420@xmath0 to that at @xmath2=@xmath2320@xmath0 ) .",
    "if the pulsars were beyond the faraday rotating region , their dms would reflect this increase in electron densities .",
    "if that is the case , then pulsars at @xmath2@xmath14@xmath2320@xmath0 should on average have much smaller dms than those at @xmath2@xmath3@xmath420@xmath0 .",

    "[ vlasubsection : enhancement ] , we have established that rms towards mid - latitudes in the longitude range 100@xmath0 - 117@xmath0 are of galactic origin and are likely due to large - scale structures .",
    "we also reach the conclusion that rms at mid - galactic latitudes likely reflect structures in magnetic fields rather than electron densities . in this section , using expressions for the halo magnetic field in the literature , we show that no existing models are successful in reproducing the observed egs rms for sight lines @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath1415@xmath0 in the longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 .",
    "it is evident that additional modeling is required to properly characterize the galactic halo magnetic field .",

    "this is consistent with recent findings of @xcite : these authors used near ir polarimetry of starlight towards @xmath13 @xmath28 150@xmath0 between @xmath475@xmath0 @xmath3b@xmath3 @xmath2310@xmath0 and simulations to rule out magnetic fields of odd parity towards the outer galaxy .",
    "since we did not find an asymmetric electron density distribution about the galactic mid - plane at @xmath1b@xmath1@xmath1420@xmath0 in section  [ vlasubsection : enhancement ] , the different rm magnitudes or orientations above and below the plane are likely due to different halo magnetic field strengths in the northern / southern hemispheres .",
    "expressions for the halo magnetic field in the literature often contain a magnetic field reversal across the galactic plane . @xcite and @xcite claim , based on the anti - symmetric sign of egs rms at high galactic latitudes towards the inner galaxy , that the milky way s halo magnetic field is dipole - like ( for which the horizontal component reverses direction across mid - plane , but the vertical component does not ) .",
    "this claim is challenged by @xcite , who demonstrated that the magnetic field geometry at the location of the sun can not be a pure dipole or a quadrupole .",
    "moreover , @xcite used rms determined from diffuse synchrotron polarized emission to show that a nearby magnetized bubble could produce part of the anti - symmetric egs rm pattern that @xcite interpreted as a signature of a global dipole - like field .",
    "although models in the literature that predict a reversal in magnetic field direction across the plane towards galactic quadrant 2 are unlikely to be physical in light these more recent works , we nonetheless plot the predictions from these models in this section .",
    "existing halo magnetic field models consist of two general types : toroidal fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or exponential plane - parallel halo fields that fall off with galacto - centric radius and distance from the mid - plane .",
    "parameters of the halo field models can be divided into two different groups as well : values that can qualitatively reproduce the halo field observables ( rms of egss , diffuse synchrotron emission and starlight polarization)(e.g .",
    "* ) , or values that are obtained by finding a best fit to the halo field observables , minimizing the @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the following , we list all the halo field expressions in the literature .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath29 that captures the dipolar nature of the halo field : its value is @xmath41 for @xmath2@xmath140@xmath0 and + 1 for @xmath2@xmath30@xmath0 .",
    "the sign is chosen such that the halo field points in the same direction ( clockwise ) as the disk field below the plane and reverses such that it is ( counterclockwise ) above the plane in galactic quadrant 2 when viewed from the north galactic pole .",
    "the halo field expressions are given in a cylindrical galacto - centric coordinate system , for which components in the radial ( @xmath30 ) , azimuth ( @xmath31 ) and vertical ( @xmath32 ) directions are listed separately .",
    "we also provide the corresponding model parameters and note whether these parameters are found qualitatively by eye or by a quantitative fit to halo field observables .    the @xcite halo field ( @xmath33 ) is given by : @xmath34 the best fit parameters are : @xmath35=8.72 kpc , the radius beyond which the horizontal field reverses across the mid - plane ; @xmath36 = 2.3 @xmath8 g , the strength of the horizontal field ; and @xmath37=@xmath42@xmath0 ( @xmath38 = @xmath430@xmath0 ) , the pitch angle for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a variation of the @xcite double torus magnetic field of the following form has been heavily used in the literature : @xmath41 the values of @xmath36 , @xmath42,@xmath43 and @xmath44 used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are summarized in table  [ vlatable : ps_field_form ] .",
    "the nature of these parameters ( qualitative or fit ) are listed in the last column of table  [ vlatable : ps_field_form ] . to illustrate the magnetic field strength of the double torus model , we have plotted the azimuthal magnetic field strength using the best fit parameters of @xcite in a vertical cross - section of the milky way in the top panel of figure  [ vlafig : visualizeb ] .",
    "finally , @xcite used a bi - toroidal halo field : @xmath45 the corresponding azimuthal magnetic field strength in a vertical cross - section of the milky way is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ vlafig : visualizeb ] .",
    "the best fit values are @xmath46 @xmath14 33.8 kpc , @xmath47 = 2.9 kpc and @xmath48 @xmath14 4.7 kpc .    in computing expected rms from various halo field models , we assume that the sun is located @xmath49= 8.4 kpc from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we further assume a disk - field - to - halo - field transition height of @xmath12 540 pc ( as inferred from the rm - vs-@xmath2 trend presented in section  [ vlasection : disk_symmetry ] ) . for the faraday rotating electrons",
    ", we use the thermal electron thick disk model of @xcite , in which the wim is modeled as an exponential disk of scale height @xmath50=1.83 kpc with a mid - plane density near the sun of @xmath51=0.014 @xmath24 .",
    "we adopt the radial dependence of the thick disk used by @xcite with a truncation at galacto - centric radius a@xmath52= 20 kpc .",
    "the exact electron density distribution used is @xmath53 @xcite adopt a vertical distribution in the form of sech@xmath54(z / h@xmath55 ) rather than the exponential in the above expression .",
    "we verify that the two z dependence produce rm against galactic latitude trends that are very similar .",
    "since we are focusing on fitting mid - latitude rms , we do not seek to fit to egs rms at @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath2215@xmath0 .",
    "we numerically integrate the thermal electron density weighted magnetic fields toward @xmath13=108.5@xmath0 , the median longitude of our surveyed area .",
    "the predicted rm - vs-@xmath2 trends are shown in figure  [ vlafig : plot_all_halo_model ] .",
    "we note that a low disk - to - halo transition height is strongly favored simply because there are more thermal electrons closer to the mid - plane , which produce larger rms given the same magnetic field distribution .",
    "if one adopts larger transition heights , the predicted @xmath1rm@xmath1 will be smaller than that shown in figure  [ vlafig : plot_all_halo_model ] due to the decrease in thermal electron density at larger distances from the galactic plane .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ vlafig : plot_all_halo_model ] that existing milky way halo magnetic field models do poorly in reproducing the observed rm - vs-@xmath2 trend for both positive and negative latitudes in the surveyed region .",
    "none of the models can simultaneously reproduce the symmetry property of the observed rm and the magnitude of the rms .",
    "the disagreement between observed rms and model predictions in this @xmath13 and @xmath2 range have been noted by several authors .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have attributed the discrepancy to radio continuum loops and region a , but we have shown in section  [ vlasubsection : location ] that these are unlikely to be the cause .",
    "we first attempt to vary parameters of the existing halo field models to match our observed rms .",
    "unfortunately , adjusting the parameters to match the observed rm magnitudes produces excess rm towards the galactic poles , for which the observed values are zero towards the north and + 6 rad m@xmath6 towards the south @xcite . instead of fitting the observed rm with a global exponential field or a double toroid above and below the plane , we choose to approach the problem by constructing a very simple model of a part of the milky way s magnetic halo to reproduce the observed rm trend .    since we reside in the milky way , drawing conclusions on the galactic halo magnetic field configuration based on egs rms is challenging without a bird s eye view .",
    "observations of external galaxies have revealed x - shaped magnetic fields in edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and axisymmetric spiral with an out - of - plane quadrupole extension in face - on spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "none of these external galaxies possess magnetic field structure similar to the milky way halo field models proposed in the literature : a pure toroidal field or a simple exponential field .",
    "therefore , current galactic halo field models might be unrealistic .    on the theoretical front , the popular double - torus model might be physically too simplistic as its pitch angle is zero everywhere in the halo .",
    "it is thought that a pure circular magnetic field can not be maintained by any velocity field against turbulent magnetic diffusion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the halo magnetic fields were of dynamo origin , then spiral magnetic field lines would form naturally , since the dynamo mechanism relies on differential rotation to transform radial fields into azimuthal fields . motivated by both observation and theory , we seek a new halo magnetic field model to explain the rms in our observed region .",
    "we assume that there is a constant , coherent azimuthal magnetic field @xmath36 parallel to the galactic plane in galacto - centric radius range @xmath56 kpc and at a height @xmath57 kpc from the galactic mid - plane .",
    "we assume the halo magnetic field strength outside this specified region is zero : @xmath58 we allow different values of @xmath36 above and below the mid - plane and assume that the faraday rotating medium is the wim thick disk @xcite .",
    "we found by performing a search in parameter space that a clockwise toroidal halo field with @xmath36 = 2 @xmath8 g above the plane and @xmath36 = 7 @xmath8 g below the plane , @xmath59 = 8.8 kpc , @xmath60 = 10.3 kpc , @xmath61=0.8 kpc and @xmath62 = 2 kpc can successfully reproduce the rm - against-@xmath2 trend in our observed area for @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath1415@xmath0 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ vlafig : b_toy_model_rm_fit ] , where the predicted rm variation as a function of latitude towards @xmath13=108.5@xmath0 ( the average galactic longitude of the observed region ) is plotted .",
    "the shape of the model - predicted rm closely matches that of the data .",
    "the 2d spatial distribution of the predicted rms in the surveyed area is plotted in the left panel of figure  [ vlafig : b_toy_model_rm_fit_2d ] , where egs rms at @xmath7@xmath1415@xmath0 are overlaid as circles with the same color scale .",
    "the color of filled circles and that of the background ( prediction from our simple model ) are in general agreement . the right panel of figure  [ vlafig : b_toy_model_rm_fit_2d ] shows the distribution of the residual rms after subtracting the model prediction from the observed rms .",
    "the residual rms are small and mostly consistent with zero .",
    "we have compared the reduce @xmath20 of our simple model to all of the models presented in section  [ vlasubsection : halo_models ] at @xmath7@xmath1415@xmath0 , in the galactic longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 .",
    "our simple model is superior to existing halo field models at larger than 99.9 % confidence level in the region of interest    the modeled coherent magnetic field exists at a distance between 0.8 and 2 kpc from the galactic disk , which is well above the @xmath32 height where the disk field dominates ( @xmath12 540 pc , section  [ vlasection : disk_symmetry ] ) .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium in the galactic halo predicts a magnetic field strength of @xmath12 3 - 4 @xmath8 g at a distance 1 - 2 kpc from the mid - plane @xcite .",
    "the best - fit magnetic field strengths towards the northern and the southern galactic hemispheres of 2 and 7 @xmath8 g are in rough agreement with hydrostatic equilibrium . the need for a strong ( 7@xmath8 g ) field could be a consequence of the simplicity of our model : we have set the coherent magnetic field strength to be zero external to galactocentric radii in the range 8.8 - 10.3 kpc . although our best - fit value for the magnetic field strength in the southern halo is comparable to that derived in the double - torus model used by @xcite , our model is unlikely to over - predict the corresponding synchrotron emission as did the @xcite model .",
    "this is because our 7@xmath8 g halo magnetic field has a much lower volume filling factor than the @xcite double - torus field model . in our model ,",
    "the distance to the region where faraday rotation occurs is approximately 1 kpc , similar to the limit implied from pulsar rms ( see section  [ vlasubsection : location ] ) .",
    "therefore , the best - fit parameters of our model appear to be consistent with other observables .    the first step to test if this simple model is realistic is to check its predictions for rm outside the vla / cgps coverage .",
    "we do so first by comparing the rm prediction in a strip from the south to the north galactic pole in the same longitude range . beyond @xmath2= @xmath530@xmath0 ,",
    "the @xcite rms can be used to test the prediction of our model . in figure",
    "[ vlafig : b_toy_model_rm_fit_ptp ] , we plot the predicted rm as a function of latitude towards @xmath13=108.5@xmath0 from @xmath2=@xmath490@xmath0 to + 90@xmath0 .",
    "the @xcite rms are binned every 2@xmath0 and the error bars represent the standard deviation of rm within each bin .",
    "our model can reproduce the rm - vs-@xmath2 trend in the observed longitude range from the south to the north galactic pole .",
    "we note that the disagreement between nvss rms and the rm prediction at @xmath2=+50@xmath0 is due to the edge of radio continuum loop iii , which could contribute at least + 18 rad m@xmath6 to the rm of egss @xcite .",
    "we did not include a @xmath12 0.3 @xmath8 g vertical magnetic field component below the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that a constant and small vertical field would only shift the entire curve up or down slightly and therefore would not affect the overall shape of rm against the @xmath2 trend .",
    "next , we compare the predicted rm from our model with the observed rms in the entire second quadrant from the south to the north galactic pole .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ vlafig : rm_prediction_q2 ] : our model can reproduce large and negative rms below the galactic plane ( region a ) . above the galactic plane , besides discrete regions where rms are affected by foreground hii regions and the boundary of the radio continuum loop iii ( at @xmath2 @xmath12 + 50@xmath0 ) , the predicted rm distribution matches the observed egs rms well .",
    "the match between the nvss rms and our model prediction can be further improved by varying the galacto - centric radius at which this non - zero azimuthal field exists , specifically by moving the region of non - zero magnetic field to larger galacto - centric radii at larger galactic longitudes .",
    "this suggests that our halo field model that can reproduce the rm - vs-@xmath2 trend towards 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 might belong to a logarithmic magnetic spiral arm in the galactic halo . in the longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 ,",
    "the best fit parameters place a strong coherent magnetic field between galacto - centric radii 8.8 and 10.3 kpc , roughly coinciding with the region between the local and perseus arm ( at a galacto - centric radius of @xmath12 9.95 kpc at galactic longitude of 134@xmath0 ) .",
    "this could be similar to the magnetic arm phenomenon seen in external galaxies such as m51 and ngc 6946 , in which coherent magnetic fields are observed to be stronger in inter - arm regions than within the arms @xcite .      as shown in sections  [ vlasubsection : halo_models ] and [ vlasubsection : b_toy_model ]",
    ", existing exponential and double - toroid galactic halo field models can not reproduce the rms in our surveyed longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 at @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath1415@xmath0 .",
    "a simple double - toroid halo field also does not conform to theory and does not provide a good match to observations of the galactic halo magnetic field . in section  [ vlasubsection : b_toy_model ] , we show that the presence of a coherent magnetic field within radial range 8.8 - 10.3 kpc at a distance 0.8 - 2 kpc from the galactic plane can reproduce the rm - vs-@xmath2 trend within the cgps / vla survey region .",
    "our model places a strong coherent field within interarm region towards the outer galaxy .",
    "moreover , we find that shifting the radial range of non - zero magnetic field strength to larger radii at larger longitude can provide a good match to the rm distribution in the entire second galactic quadrant .",
    "this is suggestive of a spiral - like galactic halo magnetic field .",
    "@xcite used the 408 mhz @xcite map and decomposed the galactic synchrotron emission into a thin disk and a thick disk .",
    "the authors estimated that the milky way synchrotron thick disk has a scale height of 1.5 kpc at the location of the sun and increases to 2.7 kpc beyond a galacto - centric radius of 12 kpc .",
    "the synchrotron thick disk has comparable height to our halo magnetic field , supporting the presence of magnetic fields at distances 1 - 2 kpc from the galactic mid - plane .",
    "moreover , this thick disk exhibits spiral structure , and the magnetic field in the thick disk is modeled to align moderately with the spiral arms .",
    "we suggest that rms in our vla / cgps latitude extension region could be probing the spiral magnetic field in the thick synchrotron disk .",
    "further insights into this proposed spiral - like thick disk field can be obtained by studying magnetic fields in milky way - type face - on galaxies such as m51 . @xcite and @xcite modeled m 51 s disk and halo field simultaneously , and found spiral magnetic fields ( of different axial symmetry ) in both its disk and its halo .",
    "the halo field has similar radial extent to the disk field with a total faraday depth of @xmath12 100 rad m@xmath6 .",
    "this is in agreement with our fitted milky way halo field : the halo field remains substantial beyond the solar radius , with @xmath1rm@xmath1 up to 100 rad m@xmath6 . in m51 ,",
    "the ratio of the total rm through the disk to that through the halo is @xmath12 2 , which is similar to the observed value for the milky way .",
    "moreover , similar to what we found in the milky way towards the outer galaxy , strong coherent halo magnetic field has been found in galactocentric radii that correspond to interarm regions in m51@xcite .",
    "other external galaxies are likely to possess spiral - like halo fields : @xcite modeled the ghz polarized emission from a sample of sings galaxy with axisymmetric thick disk spiral fields with quadrupole topology from the near - side out to @xmath12 30% of the disk radius of these galaxies .",
    "this is further evidence that the milky way could possess magnetic fields in the halo at @xmath12 few kpc from the mid - plane that trace out spiral arms .",
    "we propose that modeling of the milky way s halo magnetic field might require similar approaches to those used to model the magnetic field of the galactic disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sight lines towards mid- to high- galactic latitudes could be divided into spiral arm / inter - arm regions as well as plane parallel slabs ( in the @xmath32 direction ) .",
    "each region would have a thermal electron density described by the wim thick disk model of @xcite .",
    "the strength and direction of magnetic fields within these regions can then be derived by performing a fit to the observed egs rms empirically .",
    "carrying out such a fitting procedure to the entire galactic halo is outside the scope of this paper , but we suggest that this will yield a complete picture of the galactic halo magnetic field .",
    "locations of magnetic field reversals as well as regions with enhanced magnetic field strength in the halo can be identified , as well as the overall axial and vertical field symmetry . a better characterization of the milky way halo magnetic field would be extremely useful to constrain its origin .",
    "the existing egs rms from @xcite combined with those from future surveys , such as the polarization sky survey of the universe s magnetism ( possum ) to be conducted with the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) , will provide an evenly sampled all sky rm grid for such studies .",
    "in this paper , we set out to characterize the symmetry of the disk and halo magnetic field of the milky way .",
    "building on the cgps latitude extension region , we have conducted a vla survey of egs rms in the longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 , -30@xmath0@xmath3@xmath2@xmath3 - 3@xmath0 and + 18@xmath0@xmath3@xmath2@xmath6330@xmath0 , from which we extracted 341 reliable rms .",
    "we have shown that the disk field in this region is symmetric about the galactic mid - plane , consistent with the lack of warp of the ionized disk towards the outer galaxy .",
    "we have shown that towards mid galactic latitudes in our surveyed area , rms of egss are likely produced by a global halo magnetic field combined with thermal electrons in the thick wim disk .",
    "we demonstrate the unsatisfactory predictions for the galactic rm of existing milky way halo magnetic field models in the literature .",
    "finally , we have constructed a simple halo field model with reasonable parameters that can reproduce the rm distribution in the longitude range 100@xmath0@xmath3@xmath13@xmath3117@xmath0 from @xmath2=@xmath490@xmath0 to @xmath2390@xmath0 reasonably well .",
    "this model can be extended to explain the egs rm distribution in the entire second galactic quadrant .",
    "we propose future modeling of the galactic halo magnetic field might require techniques similar to those used to model the disk magnetic field . in future work , we will make predictions of the synchrotron emission using the simple halo field model proposed in section  [ vlasubsection : b_toy_model ] and compare it to existing galactic synchrotron emission survey data .",
