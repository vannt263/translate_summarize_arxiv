    "phosphorus nitride , pn , is a stable , strongly bound , closed shell diatomic molecule .",
    "its electronic ground state has @xmath6 symmetry and its dissociation energy is 51940@xmath7170  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has no low - lying electronically excited states : the lowest excited state is the a  @xmath8 state at about 25000  @xmath3 ( for near - equilibrium geometries , @xmath91.5   ) while the lowest - lying singlet is the a  @xmath10 state at about 40000  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "pn is an astrophysically important molecule used to probe different regions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "pn was first observed in the ism by @xcite , where it was noted that pn was more abundant than originally predicted .",
    "it was also observed in the warm star forming regions ori ( kl ) , w51 m , sgr b2 by @xcite as well as in warm molecular clouds of the star forming regions m17sw and dr  12oh by @xcite , suggesting high temperature chemistry is important for its formation .",
    "pn was detected in the carbon - rich source crl 2688 by @xcite .",
    "most recently it was observed in the lynds 1157 b1 shocked region by @xcite and in the outflow from the protostar iras 20386 + 6751 by @xcite .",
    "the chemical mechanism of the pn formation was recently studied by @xcite .",
    "as yet pn has not been observed in hotter bodies ; however @xcite studied phosphorous and found that in hotter objects , such as brown dwarfs , p - bearing gases such as pn become increasingly important at higher temperatures .",
    "similar results can be expected from exoplanets .",
    "laboratory spectroscopic studies of pn started with those of @xcite .",
    "further experimental investigations were undertaken in the sub - millimetre , radiowave , microwave and infra - red frequency ranges @xcite .",
    "some molecular and spectroscopic constants for pn computed _ ab initio _  were reported by @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to construct potential energy curves of pn @xcite .",
    "the vibrationally averaged dipole moments of @xmath0p@xmath1n for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 were determined by @xcite from molecular beam electric resonance measurements .",
    "the aim of this work is to produce accurate rotational - vibrational ( ro - vibrational ) catalogues of transitions ( so called line lists ) for the two stable isotopologues of pn , @xmath0p@xmath1n and @xmath0p@xmath2n , in their ground electronic states . to this end an _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moment curve ( dmc ) is used in conjunction with an empirically refined potential energy curve ( pec ) .",
    "our line lists should be complete enough to describe the absorption of pn up to 5000  k. this work is performed as part the exomol project , which aims to provide line lists for all the molecular transitions of importance in the atmospheres of ( exo-)planets and cool stars @xcite .",
    "the exomol methodology has been already applied to a number of diatomic molecules : beh , mgh , cah @xcite , sio @xcite , nacl and kcl @xcite , and alo @xcite .",
    "a spectroscopic line list comprises transition frequencies ( i.e. , line positions ) , einstein coefficients as well as energies , degeneracies and quantum numbers of the states involved in the transition @xcite .",
    "when combined with a partition function , a line list can be used to produce spectra at a given temperature , both in absorption and emission .",
    "each record in the line list corresponds to a transition between two energy levels , in this case ro - vibrational .",
    "these levels correspond to characteristic nuclear motions of the molecule , and thus to compute a line list one has to solve the corresponding schrdinger equation and obtain the energy levels required .",
    "the general form of the radial schrdinger equation for a diatomic molecule with atoms @xmath13 and @xmath14 in a @xmath6 electronic state is given by @xmath15\\psi_{v , j}(r ) = e_{v , j } \\psi_{v , j}(r ) , \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the potential energy curve , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the bound state eigenvalues and eigenvectors and @xmath19 is the reduced mass given by @xmath20 in this work for all nuclear motion calculation we used the following ( atomic ) masses @xcite : @xmath21  u , @xmath22  u and @xmath23  u.    einstein @xmath24 coefficients in s@xmath25 for rovibrational transitions in @xmath26 electronic terms are given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the upper and lower rotational angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath30  erg s is planck s constant in cgs units , @xmath31 is the hnl - london rotational intensity factor , @xmath32 is the transition wavenumber in @xmath3 and @xmath33 is the dipole moment curve ( dmc ) in debyes .",
    "integrated absorbtion cross - sections @xmath34 ( also referred to as integrated absorption coefficients of simply as `` line intensities '' ) in cm molecule@xmath25 can be obtained by @xmath35 where @xmath36 cm s@xmath25 is the speed of light in cgs units , @xmath37 is the lower state energy , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 is the temperature , @xmath40 is the partition functions , and @xmath41 is a nuclear spin factor .    to solve the radial schrdinger equation and compute the energy levels , spectroscopic constants and einstein coefficients required we make use of the program level  8.0 @xcite .",
    "the pec and dmc are two prerequisites for these calculations and can be obtained from first principles by solving the schrdinger equation for the motion of the electrons . since _ ab initio _",
    "pecs are not usually capable of providing accuracies better than a few @xmath3 , they are commonly refined by fitting to experimental energies or transition frequencies , subject to availability .",
    "conversely , the accuracy of _ ab initio _",
    "dmc can be high enough to be competitive with , or even better than , experiment @xcite .",
    "we use the dpotfit program @xcite to empirically refine the _ ab initio _",

    "figure [ f : absorp ] shows the absorption spectrum of @xmath0p@xmath1n at @xmath42  k. only @xmath0p@xmath1n is presented as the difference with spectra for @xmath0p@xmath2n can only be distinguished at high resolution .",
    "figure [ f : exp ] compares a spectrum of @xmath0p@xmath1n recorded by @xcite with the spectrum from this work . due to pollution of the experimental spectrum with water lines ,",
    "the spectra are far from identical ; however they show similar structure , with the @xmath43 and @xmath44 branches clearly visible in both spectra .",

    "we produced three new potential energy curve ( pec ) for pn : an _ ab initio _ pec - a , a one - parameter semi - empirical pec - s and a fully empirical 8-parameter pec - r .",
    "the produced pecs are applicable to both the @xmath0p@xmath1n and @xmath0p@xmath2n isotopologues .",
    "the empirical pec - r reproduces all known @xmath0p@xmath1n experimental data up to @xmath45 with a typical error of less than 0.01  @xmath3  and is expected to be the most accurate of the three .",
    "transition frequencies for the minor isotopologue @xmath0p@xmath2n are expected to be somewhat less accurate .",
    "experimental pure rotational transitions for both isotopologues with @xmath46 @xcite in the microwave region are reproduced within @xmath47  @xmath3 .",
    "levels with @xmath48 to @xmath49 are expected to have larger errors , in the range 0.1 to 1.0  @xmath3 .",
    "the accuracy of semiempirical pec - s should be in most cases not much worse than the quoted values for pec - r .",
    "errors in the _ ab initio _ pec - a are larger by a factor 10100 .",
    "levels with @xmath50 are expected to have very large errors for all pecs , in the range 10200  @xmath3 ; however , transition frequences with @xmath50 and @xmath51 should be accurate to @xmath525  @xmath3 .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to improve the accuracy for high @xmath4 s .",
    "an _ ab initio _ dipole moment was produced and , together with the pec - r , used to compute line lists ( comprising transition line positions and einstein coefficients ) for @xmath0p@xmath1n and @xmath0p@xmath2n .",
    "details of the line lists are reported in table  [ t : linelist ] .",
    "the line list cover all rotational - vibrational levels up to dissociation but , as discussed above , transitions involving @xmath53 may be seriously in error .",
    "partition functions accurate to about 0.01% were also calculated for a range of temperatures for both isotopologues .",
    "work done previously by @xcite shows a great deal of agreement with our partition function , with the exception of temperatures below 1000  k where irwin s results are not valid .",
    "the supplementary material to this paper includes the line lists and partition functions of @xmath0p@xmath1n and @xmath0p@xmath2n , as well as the pecs and dmcs used in these calculations together with the level  8.0 and dpotfit input / output files , and a fortran program which uses the state and transition files to compute spectra .",
