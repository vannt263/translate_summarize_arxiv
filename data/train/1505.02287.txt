    "within @xmath1 yang - mills gauge theories , it is well accepted that the asymptotic particle spectrum does not contain the elementary excitations of quarks and gluons .",
    "these color charged objects are confined into color neutral bound states : this is the so - called color confinement phenomenon .",
    "it is widely believed that confinement arises due to non - perturbative infrared effects .",
    "many criteria for confinement have been proposed ( see the nice pedagogical introduction @xcite ) .",
    "a very natural observation is that gluons ( due to the fact that they are not observed experimentally ) should not belong to the physical spectrum in a confining theory . on the other hand",
    ", the perturbative gluon propagator satisfies the criterion to belong to the physical spectrum ( namely , it has a klln - lehmann spectral representation with positive spectral density ) .",
    "hence , non - perturbative effects must dress the perturbative propagator in such a way that the positivity conditions are violated , such that it does not belong to the physical spectrum anymore .",
    "a well - known criterion is related to the fact that the polyakov loop @xcite is an order parameter for the confinement / deconfinement phase transition via its connection to the free energy of a ( very heavy ) quark .",
    "the importance to clarify the interplay between these two different points of view ( nonperturbative green function s behaviour vs.  polyakov loop ) can be understood by observing that while there are , in principle , infinitely many different ways to write down a gluon propagator which violates the positivity conditions , it is very likely that only few of these ways turns out to be compatible with the polyakov criterion .",
    "one of the most fascinating non - perturbative infrared effects is related to the appearance of gribov copies @xcite which represent an intrinsic overcounting of the gauge - field configurations which the perturbative gauge - fixing procedure is unable to take care of . soon after gribov s seminal paper , singer showed that any true gauge condition , as the landau gauge , presents this obstruction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of gribov copies close to the identity induces the existence of non - trivial zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator , which make the path integral ill defined .",
    "even when perturbation theory around the vacuum is not affected by gribov copies close to the identity ( in particular , when ym - theory is defined over a flat space - time with trivial topology @xcite ) , gribov copies have to be taken into account when considering more general cases ( such as with toroidal boundary conditions on flat space - time @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the following only the standard boundary conditions will be considered .    the most effective method to eliminate gribov copies , at leading order proposed by gribov himself , and refined later on by zwanziger",
    "@xcite corresponds to restricting the path integral to the so - called gribov region , which is the region in the functional space of gauge potentials over which the faddeev - popov operator is positive definite .",
    "the faddeev ",
    "popov operator is hermitian in the landau gauge , so it makes sense to discuss its sign . in @xcite dellantonio and",
    "zwanziger showed that all the orbits of the theory intersect the gribov region , indicating that no physical information is lost when implementing this restriction .",
    "even though this region still contains copies which are not close to the identity @xcite , this restriction has remarkable effects .",
    "in fact , due to the presence of a dynamical ( gribov ) mass scale , the gluon propagator is suppressed while the ghost propagator is enhanced in the infrared .",
    "more general , an approach in which the gluon propagator is `` dressed '' by non - perturbative corrections which push the gluon out of the physical spectrum leads to propagators and glueball masses in agreement with the lattice data @xcite . with the same approach",
    ", one can also solve the old problem of the casimir energy in the mit - bag model canfora:2013zna .",
    "moreover , the extension of the gribov gap equation at finite temperature provides one with a good qualitative understanding , already within the semiclassical approximation , of the deconfinement temperature as well as of a possible intermediate phase in which features of the confining phase coexist with features of the fully deconfined phase in agreement with different approaches ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , within this framework the presence of the higgs field @xcite as well of a chern - simons term in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite can be accounted for as well .",
    "for all these reasons , it makes sense to compute the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop when we eliminate the gribov copies using the gribov ",
    "zwanziger ( gz ) approach .",
    "related computations are available using different techniques to cope with nonperturbative propagators at finite temperature , see e.g.  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we will perform for the first time ( to the best of the authors knowledge ) this computation , using two different techniques , to the leading one - loop approximation . in @xcite ,",
    "it was already pointed out that the gribov ",
    "zwanziger quantization offers an interesting way to illuminate some of the typical infrared problems for finite temperature gauge theories .    in section 2",
    ", we provide a brief technical overview of the gribov  zwanziger quantization process and eventual effective action . in the following section 3 ,",
    "the polyakov loop is introduced into the gz theory via the background field method , building on work of other people @xcite .",
    "next , section 4 handles the technical computation of the leading order finite temperature effective action , while in section 5 we discuss the gap equations , leading to our estimates for both polyakov loop and gribov mass .",
    "the key finding is a deconfinement phase transition at the same temperature at which the gribov mass develops a cuspy behaviour .",
    "we subsequently also discuss the pressure and energy anomaly .",
    "due to a problem with the pressure in the gz formalism ( regions of negativity ) , we take a preliminary look at the situation upon invoking the more recently developed refined gribov ",
    "zwanziger approach .",
    "we summarize in section 7 .",
    "let us start by giving a short overview of the gribov  zwanziger framework @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction , the gribov ",
    "zwanziger action arises from the restriction of the domain of integration in the euclidean functional integral to the gribov region @xmath2 , which is defined as the set of all gauge field configurations fulfilling the landau gauge , @xmath3 , and for which the faddeev  popov operator @xmath4 is strictly positive , namely @xmath5the boundary @xmath6 of the region @xmath7 is the ( first ) gribov horizon .",
    "one starts with the faddeev ",
    "popov action in the landau gauge @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote , respectively , the yang  mills and the gauge - fixing terms , namely @xmath11and @xmath12where @xmath13 stand for the faddeev ",
    "popov ghosts , @xmath14 is the lagrange multiplier implementing the landau gauge , @xmath15 is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation of @xmath1 , and @xmath16 denotes the field strength : @xmath17following gribov:1977wm , zwanziger:1988jt , zwanziger:1989mf , zwanziger:1992qr , the restriction of the domain of integration in the path integral is achieved by adding to the faddeev ",
    "popov action @xmath18 an additional term @xmath19 , called the horizon term , given by the following non - local expression @xmath20 ^{ad}(x , y)f^{dec}a_{\\mu } ^{e}(y)\\ ; , \\label{hf1}\\]]where @xmath21 stands for the inverse of the faddeev ",
    "popov operator .",
    "the partition function can then be written as gribov:1977wm , zwanziger:1988jt , zwanziger:1989mf , zwanziger:1992qr : @xmath22where @xmath23 is the euclidean space - time volume .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 has the dimension of a mass and is known as the gribov parameter .",
    "it is not a free parameter of the theory .",
    "it is a dynamical quantity , being determined in a self - consistent way through a gap equation called the horizon condition @xcite , given by @xmath25where the notation @xmath26 means that the vacuum expectation value of the horizon function @xmath27 has to be evaluated with the measure defined in eq ..",
    "an equivalent all - order proof of eq . can be given within the original gribov no - pole condition framework @xcite , by looking at the exact ghost propagator in an external gauge field @xcite .    although the horizon term @xmath28 , eq .",
    ", is non - local , it can be cast in local form by means of the introduction of a set of auxiliary fields @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are a pair of bosonic fields , while @xmath31 are anti - commuting .",

    "mills action plus gauge fixing and gribov  zwanziger terms , in its localized version , @xmath44with @xmath45and @xmath46it can be seen from that the horizon condition takes the simpler form @xmath47which is called the gap equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the vacuum energy defined by @xmath49    the local action @xmath50 in eq .",
    "is known as the gribov ",
    "zwanziger action .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown to be renormalizable to all orders zwanziger:1988jt , zwanziger:1989mf , zwanziger:1992qr , maggiore:1993wq , dudal:2007cw , dudal:2008sp , dudal:2010fq , dudal:2011gd .",
    "this important property of the gribov ",
    "zwanziger action is a consequence of an extenstive set of ward identities constraining the quantum corrections in general and possible divergences in particular .",
    "in fact , introducing the nilpotent brst transformations @xmath51it can immediately be checked that the gribov ",
    "zwanziger action exhibits a soft breaking of the brst symmetry , as summarized by the equation @xmath52where @xmath53notice that the breaking term @xmath54 is of dimension two in the fields . as such",
    ", it is a soft breaking and the ultraviolet divergences can be controlled at the quantum level .",
    "the properties of the soft breaking of the brst symmetry of the gribov  zwanziger theory and its relation with confinement have been object of intensive investigation in recent years , see baulieu:2008fy , dudal:2009xh , sorella:2009vt , sorella:2010it , capri:2010hb , dudal:2012sb , reshetnyak:2013bga , cucchieri:2014via , capri:2014bsa , schaden:2014bea . here , it suffices to mention that the broken identity is connected with the restriction to the gribov region @xmath2 .",
    "however , a set of brst invariant composite operators whose correlation functions exhibit the klln - lehmann spectral representation with positive spectral densities can be consistently introduced @xcite .",
    "these correlation functions can be employed to obtain mass estimates on the spectrum of the glueballs @xcite .",
    "let us conclude this brief review of the gribov ",
    "zwanziger action by noticing that the terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 in expression can be rewritten in the form of a pure brst variation , i.e. @xmath57 so that @xmath58 from which eq . becomes apparent .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of the @xmath0 gauge field theory in the presence of two static sources of ( heavy ) quarks .",
    "the standard way to achieve this goal is by probing the polyakov loop order parameter , @xmath59 with @xmath60 denoting path ordering , needed in the non - abelian case to ensure the gauge invariance of @xmath61 .",
    "this path ordering is not relevant at one - loop order , which will considerably simplify the computations of the current work . in analytical studies of the phase transition involving the polyakov loop ,",
    "one usually imposes the so - called `` polyakov gauge '' on the gauge field , in which case the time - component @xmath62 becomes diagonal and independent of ( imaginary ) time .",
    "this means that the gauge field belongs to the cartan subalgebra .",
    "more details on polyakov gauge can be found in @xcite . besides the trivial simplification of the polyakov loop , when imposing the polyakov gauge it turns out that the quantity @xmath63 becomes a good alternative choice for the order parameter instead of @xmath61 .",
    "this extra benefit can be proven by means of jensen s inequality for convex functions and is carefully explained in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "for example , for the @xmath0 case we have the following : if @xmath64 then we are in the `` unbroken symmetry phase '' ( confined or disordered phase ) , equivalent to @xmath65 ; otherwise , if @xmath66 , we are in the `` broken symmetry phase '' ( deconfined or ordered phase ) , equivalent to @xmath67 . since @xmath68 with @xmath69 the temperature and @xmath70 the free energy of a heavy quark , it is clear that in the confinement phase , an infinite amount of energy would be required to actually get a free quark .",
    "the broken / restored symmetry referred to is the @xmath71 center symmetry of a pure gauge theory ( no dynamical matter in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "a slightly alternative approach to access the polyakov loop was worked out in @xcite . in order to probe the phase transition in a quantized non - abelian gauge field theory , we use , following @xcite , the background field gauge ( bfg ) formalism , detailed in general in e.g.  @xcite . within this framework",
    ", the effective gauge field will be defined as the sum of a classical field @xmath72 and a quantum field @xmath73 : @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the infinitesimal generators of the @xmath1 symmetry group .",
    "the bfg method is a convenient approach , since the tracking of breaking / restoration of the @xmath76 symmetry becomes easier by choosing the polyakov gauge for the background field .    within this framework ,",
    "it is convenient to define the gauge condition for the quantum field , @xmath77 known as the landau  dewitt ( ldw ) gauge fixing condition , where @xmath78 is the background covariant derivative . after integrating out the ( gauge fixing ) auxiliary field @xmath14",
    ", we end up with the following yang ",
    "mills action , @xmath79 notice that , concerning the quantum field @xmath73 , the condition is equivalent to the landau gauge , yet the action still has background center symmetry . the ldw gauge is actually recovered in the limit @xmath80 , taken at the very end of each computation .",
    "it is perhaps important here to stress that we are restricting our analysis to the ( background ) landau gauge , for which a derivation argument in favor of the action can be provided . for a vanishing background , this is precisely the original gribov - zwanziger construction @xcite , also applicable to the coulomb gauge .",
    "more recently , it was also generalized to the @xmath0 maximal abelian gauge in @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it might be clear that the precise influence on the quantum dynamics by gribov copies can strongly depend on the chosen background , given that gribov copies are defined via the zero modes of the faddeev - popov operator of the chosen gauge condition , which itself explicitly depends on the chosen background .",
    "this is open to further research , as it has not been pursued in the literature yet .",
    "though , for a constant background as relevant for the current purposes , it will be discussed elsewhere that the action is indeed obtainable via a suitable extension of the arguments of @xcite .    in the absence of a background ,",
    "a proposal for a generalization to the linear covariant gauges was put forward in @xcite , albeit leading to a very complicated nonlocal lagrangian structure , containing e.g.  reciprocals and exponentials of fields . to our knowledge",
    ", no practical computations were done so far with this formalism .",
    "nonetheless , potential problems with gauge parameter dependence of physical quantities were discussed in @xcite , not surprisingly linked to the softly broken brst symmetry , see also our section 2 for more on this and relevant references .",
    "a very recent alternative for the linear covariant gauges was worked out in @xcite , partially building on earlier work of @xcite . with this proposal ,",
    "it was explicitly checked at one loop that the gribov parameter @xmath81 and vacuum energy are gauge parameter independent .",
    "this at least suggests that in this class of covariant gauges , an approach to gribov copies can be worked out that is compatible with gauge parameter independence @xcite .",
    "as explained for the simple landau gauge in the previous section , the landau background gauge condition is also plagued by gribov ambiguities , and the gribov ",
    "zwanziger procedure is applicable also in this instance .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is , therefore , the gz action modified for the bfg framework ( see @xcite ) : @xmath82 as mentioned before , with the polyakov gauge imposed to the background field @xmath72 , the time - component becomes diagonal and time - independent . in other words , we have @xmath83 , with @xmath84 belonging to the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group .",
    "for instance , in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath0 only the @xmath85 generator is present , so that @xmath86 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , at leading order we then simply find , using the properties of the pauli matrices , @xmath87 where we defined @xmath88 with @xmath89 the inverse temperature .",
    "just like before , @xmath90 corresponds to the confinement phase , while @xmath91 corresponds to deconfinement . with a slight abuse of language",
    ", we will refer to the quantity @xmath92 as the polyakov loop hereafter .",
    "since the scope of this work is limited to one - loop order , only terms quadratic in the quantum fields in the action shall be considered .",
    "one then immediately gets an action that can be split in term coming from the two color sectors : the 3rd color direction , called cartan direction , which does not depend on the parameter @xmath92 ; and one coming from the @xmath93 block given by the 1st and 2nd color directions .",
    "this second @xmath94 color sector is orthogonal to the cartan direction and does depend on @xmath92 .",
    "the scenario can then be seen as a system where the vector field has an imaginary chemical potential @xmath95 and has isospins @xmath96 and @xmath97 related to the @xmath94 color sector and one isospin @xmath98 related to the @xmath99 color sector .",
    "considering only the quadratic terms of , the integration of the partition function gives us the following vacuum energy at one - loop order , defined according to , @xmath100where @xmath23 is now just the spacial volume . here",
    ", @xmath101 is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation in the presence of the background @xmath102 field and @xmath103 . throughout this work ,",
    "it is always tacitly assumed we are working with @xmath104 colors , although we will frequently continue to explicitly write @xmath105 dependence for generality . using the usual matsubara formalism , we have that @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the matsubara mode , @xmath108 is the spacelike momentum component , and @xmath109 is the isospin , given by @xmath97 , @xmath98 , or @xmath96 for the @xmath0 case case was handled in @xcite as well ( see also @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the general trace is of the form @xmath110 which will be computed immediately below .",
    "we want to compute the following expression : @xmath111 one way to proceed is to start by deriving the previous expression with respect to @xmath112 .",
    "then , one can use the well - known formula from complex analysis @xmath113 where the sum is over the poles @xmath114 of the function @xmath115 .",
    "subsequently we integrate with respect to @xmath112 ( and determine the integration constant by matching the result with the known @xmath116 case ) .",
    "finally one can split off the analogous @xmath116 trace ( which does not depend on the background field ) to find @xmath117 where the limit @xmath118 was taken in the ( convergent ) second integral . the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "is the ( divergent ) zero temperature contribution .",
    "another way to compute the above integral is by making use of zeta function regularization techniques , which are particularly useful in the computation of the casimir energy in various configurations see @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this second technique is that , although it is less direct , it provides one with an easy way to analyze the high and low temperature limits as well as the small mass limit , as we will now show .",
    "moreover , within this framework , the regularization procedures are often quite transparent .",
    "one starts by writing the logarithm as @xmath119 , after which the integral over the momenta can be performed : @xmath120 ^{\\frac{3}{2}-s}\\right ) \\;,\\]]where the renormalization scale @xmath121 has been introduced to get dimensional agreement for @xmath122 , and where we already put @xmath123 , as @xmath109 will function as a regulator  i.e.  we assume @xmath124 and analytically continuate to bring @xmath125 . using the integral representation of the gamma function , the previous expression can be recast to @xmath126where the variable of integration was transformed as @xmath127 in the second line . using the poisson rule ( valid for positive @xmath40 ) : @xmath128we obtain that @xmath129 \\;,\\end{gathered}\\]]where @xmath130 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . simplifying this ,",
    "we find @xmath131 -\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } { \\frac{m^{2}t^{2}\\cos { ( nr)}}{\\pi ^{2}n^{2}}k_{2}\\left ( \\frac{nm}{t}\\right ) } \\ ; ,   \\label{result2}\\]]where the first term is the @xmath116 contribution , and the sum is the finite - temperature correction . using numerical integration and series summation , it can be checked that both results and are indeed identical . throughout this paper",
    ", we will mostly base ourselves on the expression .",
    "nonetheless the bessel series is quite useful in obtaining the limit cases @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 by means of the corresponding behaviour of @xmath135 .",
    "observing that @xmath136we obtain @xmath137,\\]]where @xmath138 is the polylogarithm or jonquire s function .",
    "analogously , @xmath139 so that @xmath140 + \\frac{t^2}{4 \\pi^2 } \\left\\{m^2 \\left[\\text{li}_2\\left(e^{-i r s}\\right)+\\text{li}_2\\left(e^{i r s}\\right)\\right]-4 t^2 \\left[\\text{li}_4\\left(e^{-i r s}\\right)+\\text{li}_4\\left(e^{i r s}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] finally for @xmath141 we can use the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath143 are finite factors .",

    "as a first simpler case , let us simplify matters slightly by assuming that the temperature does not influence the gribov parameter @xmath149 .",
    "this means that @xmath149 will be supposed to assume its zero - temperature value , which we will call @xmath150 , given by the solution of the gap equation at zero temperature . in this case , only the terms with the function @xmath151 matter in , since the other terms do not explicitely depend on the polyakov line @xmath92 .",
    "plotting this part of the potential ( see  [ energieplot ] ) , one finds by visual inspection that a second - order phase transition occurs from the minimum with @xmath90 to a minimum with @xmath152 .",

    "it can be seen that the minimum of the potential moves away from @xmath160 in between @xmath161 and @xmath162 . ]",
    "let us now investigate what happens to the gribov parameter @xmath149 when the temperature is nonzero .",
    "taking the derivative of the effective potential with respect to @xmath163 and dividing by @xmath164 ( as we are not interested in the solution @xmath165 ) yields the gap equation for general number of colors @xmath105 : @xmath166 where the notation @xmath167 denotes the derivative of @xmath151 with respect to its first argument ( written @xmath112 in ) .",
    "if we now define @xmath159 to be the solution to the gap equation at @xmath116 : @xmath168 then we can subtract this equation from the general gap equation . after dividing through @xmath169 and setting @xmath170 and @xmath104 ,",

    "this is in contrast with the original gz predictions , such that it could happen that the finite temperature version of rgz is also better suited to describe the phase transition and/or thermodynamical properties of the pure gauge theory .    due to the more complex nature of the rgz effective action ( more vacuum condensates )",

    "therefore , we will always consider the difference @xmath229 . since in the present ( rgz )",
    "prescription the condensates are given by the zero temperature lattice results instead of satisfying gap equations , the divergent contributions to the free energy are subtracted , and no specific choice of renormalization scheme is needed . furthermore , explicit dependence on the coupling constant seems to drop out of the one - loop expression , such that no renormalization scale has to be chosen . following the steps taken in section [ tonafhankelijk ] , we find a second order phase transition at the temperature :    @xmath230    which is not that far from the value of the @xmath0 deconfinement temperature found on the lattice : @xmath231 , as quoted in @xcite .    in future work",
    ", it would in particular be interesting to find out whether upon using the rgz formalism the gribov mass and/or rgz condensates directly feel the deconfinement transition , similar to the cusp we discovered in the gribov parameter following the exploratory restricted analysis of this paper .",
    "this might also allow to shed further light on the ongoing discussion of whether the deconfinement transition should be felt at the level of the correlation functions , in particular the electric screening mass associated with the longitudinal gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "let us also consider the pressure and interaction measure once more .",

    "zwanziger ( gz ) action for @xmath0 gauge theories with the polyakov loop coupled to it via the background field formalism .",

    "the latter dynamical scale enters the theory as a result of the restriction of the domain of gauge field integration to avoid ( infinitesimally connected ) gribov copies .",
    "our main result is that we found clear evidence of a second order deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature , an occurrence accompanied by a cusp in the gribov mass , which thus directly feels the transition .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to stress here that at temperatures above @xmath213 , the gribov mass is nonzero , indicating that the gluon propagator still violates positivity and as such it rather describes a quasi- than a freeobservable particle , see also @xcite for more on this .",

    "a further result of the present paper , which is interesting from the methodological point of view , is that it shows explicitly that finite - temperature computations ( such as the computation of the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop ) are very suitable to be analyzed using analytical casimir - like techniques .",
    "the interesting issue of casimir - style computations at finite temperatures is that , although they can be more involved , they provide one with easy tools to analyze the high and low temperature limits as well as the small mass limit .",
    "moreover , within the casimir framework , the regularization procedures are often quite transparent .",
    "indeed , in the present paper , we have shown that the computation of the vacuum expectation value of the polyakov loop is very similar to the computation of the casimir energy between two plates .",
