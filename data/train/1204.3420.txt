    "the origin of the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) still remains unclear though it has been found for more than 40 years and many progresses have been made .",
    "generally grbs have complex temporal profiles with plenty of pulses and pulse is the basic element of light curves . the pulses for most bursts overlap each other , while there also exist well - separated pulses within some bursts .",
    "a lot of statistical studies about pulses have been made because they can provides us valuable clues to the radiation mechanism and underlying processes of grb . in early statistical analysis ,",
    "the width of grb pulses was found to be energy dependent , i.e. , the higher energies , the narrower widthes ( e.g. , link , epstein & priedhorsky 1993 ) . using the average autocorrelation function to study the average pulse width , fenimore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the average pulse width of many bursts dependence on energy is well fitted by a power - law function with the power - law index about -0.4 .",
    "the result was confirmed by later studies ( e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1996 ; norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ; nemiroff 2000 ; crew et al . 2003",
    "; norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "peng et al .",
    "( 2006 ) employed two samples consisting of 82 well - separated pulses to test the relation and found a power - law anti - correlation between the full pulse width and energy . a power - law correlation between the pulse width ratio and energy",
    "is also seen in the light curves of the majority of bursts in the two samples within the energy range of batse ( burst and transient source experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ) .",
    "recently it is found that this power - law relation can be extended to x - ray bands ( see , zhang & qin 2008 , zhang 2008 ) as well as x - ray flare ( chincarini et al . 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , zhang & qin ( 2007 ) showed that the pulse peak time , the rise time scale , and the decay time scale on energy are also power - law functions .",
    "the origin of the dependence of the pulse width on photon energy is still unclear to date .",
    "it has been suggested that the power - law relation could be attributed to synchrotron cooling ( e.g. , kazanas , titarchuk & hua 1998 , chiang 1998 ; dermer 1998 ; wang et al .",
    "2000 ) , which gives a slope of -1/2 between the pulse width and photon energy , similar to the observed -0.4 . however , the synchrotron cooling is unlikely to be responsible for the relation due to its too short timescale relative to the pulse width . under the assumption that the doppler effect of the relativistically expanding fireball surface ( or , in some papers , the curvature effect ) is important , qin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that , in most cases , this power - law relationship would exist in a certain energy range , and , within a similar range , a power - law relation of an opposite trend between the ratio of the rising width to the decaying width and energy would be expected for the same burst .",
    "shen , song & li ( 2005 ) also considered the curvature effect and found the slope of the power - law relation to be -0.1@xmath8 - 0.2 , less than the observed -0.4 .",
    "these suggest that the curvature effect is an important factor to form the relation .",
    "the observed spectrum of grb is usually a broken power - law form .",
    "the smooth connection of two power laws is the so - called band function , which can described well the observed spectrum ( band et al . 1993 ) .",
    "three parameters in the band function are used to characterize the spectral shape : the low - energy power - law index @xmath3 , the high - energy power - law index @xmath4 , and the peak of the spectral energy distribution @xmath9 .",
    "it is found that the distributions of the power - law slopes of pulse width and photon energy obtained by peng et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and zhang & qin ( 2007 ) have large dispersions for different bursts , while the grb spectra also vary dramatically for two different bursts . whether the energy dependence of pulse is connected with the observed spectrum in some way or not ? if it is true , then what does it imply for the mechanism of energy dependence of grb pulse and whether does it supply some useful clues to the origin of the pulse rise and the decay phase ?",
    "these motivate our investigations below . in section 2",
    ", we present the sample description and pulse modeling .",
    "the analysis results are given in section 3 .",
    "we give the possible implications of the statistical correlations in section 4 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in the last section .",
    "the sample we selected comes from peng et al . ( 2010 ) observed by cgro / batse with durations longer than 2 s , which contains 52 individual fred pulses with the peak fluxes are greater than 1.0 photon @xmath10 @xmath11 on a 256-ms time - scale ( for further information about the sample selection and spectral analysis , see kocevski et al . 2003 ; peng et al . 2009a ; peng et al . 2010 ) .    in order to investigate the pulse temporal properties , we must model these pulses with a pulse model . a form proportional to the inverse of the product of two exponentials , one increasing and one decreasing with time , derived by norris et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , is a good model to describe the grb pulses .",
    "thus we select the pulse model to model our selected pulses , which can be rewritten as @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the time since trigger , @xmath14 is the pulse amplitude , @xmath15 is the pulse start time , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the characteristics of the pulse rise and the pulse decay , and @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] .    similar to peng et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2009a ) and hakkila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we use the nonlinear least squares routine mpfit and develop and apply an interactive idl routine to fit all of the pulses , which allows the user to set and adjust the initial pulse parameters manually before allowing the fitting routine to converge on the best - fitting model via the reduced @xmath19 minimization . for each burst",
    "we require that the signal should be detectable in at least three channels ( in this way , the relationship between the pulse width and energy can be studied ) .",
    "the fits are examined many times to ensure that they are indeed the best ones .",
    "we demonstrate the results with the fitting to grb 950624b ( batse trigger 3648 ) , in which three well - separated pulses were observed in four batse energy channels .",
    "the narrow distribution of the fitting @xmath19 values per degree of freedom ( see , the right panel in figure 1 ) indicates that the two - exponential model is sufficient to model the pulse light curves .",
    "the parameter values for all identified pulses are obtained , including the pulse peak intensity ( @xmath14 ) , pulse onset time ( @xmath15 ) , effective onset time ( @xmath20 ) , and peak time ( @xmath21 ) , as well as the two fundamental timescales ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) ( see table 2 in norris et al .",
    "the effective onset time , @xmath20 , is defined as the time when the pulse reaches 0.01 times of the peak intensity .",
    "both onset times are relative to the burst trigger time . according to the fitting parameters",
    "we can obtain the measured pulse temporal properties including the pulse width @xmath22 , the pulse rise width , @xmath23 , and the decay width @xmath24 .",
    "fitting the pulse width , the pulse rise width , the pulse decay width ( in the logarithm ) per channel as a function of the geometric means of the lower and upper batse channel boundaries ( using 300@xmath251000 kev for channel 4 ) ( norris et al . 2005 ) shows the power - law relations indeed exist and the power - law indices are thus obtained ( let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denote the indices of the power - law relations between @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and energy , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the dependence of the three time quantities on energy can be parameterized by the power - law index .",
    "example plots of the relations between the temporal properties and energy are illustrated in figure 2 and the three power - law indices are presented in table 1 .    in order to obtain the consistent time intervals between the light curves and spectra in the same pulse the time - integrated spectra",
    "are reanalyzed for each pulse of our sample based on the analysis of peng et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , which provided a detailed data description and spectral modeling of our sample . only the so - called band model ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) is used to model the pulse spectra in this work . in the end",
    "there are 51 pulses that are included in our analysis after removing one bad pulse spectrum with band model in the certain time interval .",

    "these artificial definitions of pulse width could lead to the result that the energy dependence of pulse width with energy does not be _ measured _ though it can present .",

    "only if one of the photon energies or both of them satisfy the condition @xmath95 $ ] , the energy dependence of pulse width would be _",
    "measured_. if we consider the time @xmath83 , then @xmath96 gives [ alpha ] > 1 - 1/ln(e_p / e_a ) . in this condition ,",
    "the closer to @xmath5 the photon energy ( i.e. , the higher energy ) , the narrower the pulse width of this energy , shown in figure 8 .",
    "this naturally explains the energy dependence of pulse width .",
    "if two energy bands are both more energetic than @xmath5 , then the pulse widthes in these two bands will be the same , i.e. , no pulse broadening with energy presents in current consideration .",
    "batse bursts , the typical @xmath5 is @xmath97 kev , the typical low energy slope is @xmath98 and four energy channels are ( 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , and 300 - 1000 kev ) ( preece et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the condition ( [ alpha ] ) give @xmath99 kev for the typical parameters .",
    "therefor for energy channels 1 and 2 , the condition is not satisfied and thus the pulse broadening in low energy band will not be measured in the two channels .",
    "however , it is so only for typical parameters .",
    "for a specific burst , @xmath100 may be satisfied .",
    "channel 3 crosses the typical @xmath5 , while channel 4 is larger than it and thus only decays with @xmath78 .",
    "thus the pulse width will generally decrease from energy channel 4 to channel 2 . in current consideration ,",
    "our results indicate no broadening measured in channels 1 and 2 for the bursts with typical parameters . however , there are two possibilities to lead to the broadening in channels 1 and 2 .",
    "one possibility is that the shell of internal shock is not a spherical symmetry , which is proposed by some authors , e.g. , fenimore & sumner ( 1997 ) and kocevski , ryde & liang ( 2003 ) .",
    "kocevski , ryde & liang 2003 found that only @xmath101 bursts are consistent with the spherical curvature .",
    "their results point to a picture that the shell is a prolate geometry for a large number of bursts . in this case",
    ", the doppler factor is decreasing faster than the spherical geometry so that the condition of ( [ alpha ] ) is easier to satisfy .",
    "thus the prolate shell could lead to the broadening in channels 1 and 2 .",
    "another one is that the intrinsic spectrum can be evolving .",
    "if the intrinsic spectrum is evolving , e.g. , @xmath5 decreasing with time , then the condition ( [ alpha ] ) can be satisfied so that the pulses in channels 1 and 2 also broaden with energy .",
    "however , we do not know how the intrinsic spectrum evolves and how fast it does .",
    "the curvature effect naturally gives rise to an observed spectral evolution due to the doppler effect , which gives an @xmath5 decay with @xmath102 for a spherical curvature .",
    "if intrinsic spectral evolution gives a steeper observed one than @xmath102 , then it will be masked and thus yield to @xmath102 given by curvature effect .",
    "the above analysis assumes the intrinsic spectrum is broken power law , so the light curve broken of decay phase at @xmath80 can be seen clearly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lcc ] ) .",
    "actually the grb spectrum is generally smoothly connected at the broken energy , namely , the band spectrum , and the observed light curve is usually from an energy interval , not a single energy , so the observed decay phase is usually smooth .",
    "note that total pulse width in grb is dominated by decay phase . thus the curvature effect+band spectrum we consider here can provide a natural explanation to the energy dependence of grb total pulse width , not only the decay width .    .",
    "the dashed lines label the positions of half and @xmath82 maximum flux .",
    "line a decays as @xmath103 , lines b , c , d and e first as @xmath104 and then as @xmath103 and line f as @xmath104 .",
    "lines b and c show energy dependence of width of decay while the lines d and e do not due @xmath105 if considering fwhm as the decay width . ]",
    "we have shown the band spectrum+curvature effect is a reason of pulse broadening with photon energy .",
    "different band function parameters will cause the differences of the degree of pulse broadening .",
    "however , the effects of the three band function parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , on the degree of pulse broadening are different .",
    "the main effect seems to come from the low - energy slope .",
    "the reason is the low - energy section is usually flatter than the high one , i.e. , @xmath106 .",
    "thus the decay , @xmath77 , is also more shallow than @xmath107 with the pulse decay width dominated by @xmath3 , unless the given energy @xmath108 .",
    "one can come to the conclusion that the larger @xmath3 , the more significant the broadening with energy .",
    "suppose two extreme cases : @xmath109 , i.e. , the spectrum is a single power law ; @xmath110 and @xmath111 , i.e. , the spectrum is composed of a horizon line and the vertical line",
    ". the pulse width would be the same for different energy bands in the former case , while the broadening of pulse with energy is the most significant in the latter case .",
    "other cases lies between the two cases .",
    "it is difficult to find directly whether this is consistent with the observed anticorrelation in the earlier sections .",
    "we thus make a calculation to test that .    in order to compare with the observations ,",
    "we calculate the count rate within four energy channels ( 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , and 300 - 1000 kev ) with equation [ eq : count rate ] .",
    "further we calculate the decay width of pulse within the four energy channels , fit linearly the width - energy relation and then find the power law slope , @xmath1 .",
    "figure 9 shows our theoretically calculated @xmath112 relation .",
    "obviously , @xmath3 and @xmath1 are roughly linearly anti - correlated , which is consistent with the statistical results of the observations .",
    "the fitted slope in figure 9 is  0.3 , also roughly consistent with the statistical results .",
    "this suggests that the curvature effect+band spectrum could lead to the observed @xmath6 correlation . strictly speaking , @xmath1 and @xmath3",
    "are not linearly correlated for the theoretical results ( still see figure 9 ) , not completely consistent with the observations . however , in our calculations , some plausible values of the parameters , for instance the lorentz factor and the peak energy , are used , disregarding the variety of the parameter value for different bursts , which could lead to the inconsistency .",
    "further whether the relation in physics is linearly anti - correlated or other forms is not important .",
    "the observed relation results from the sum of intrinsic physical factors , such as the band spectrum , curvature effect and some artificial factors , such as the energy channel selection of batse and the pulse width definition , which is difficult to figure out one by one . here",
    "we only focus on the band spectrum and curvature effect .",
    "what we concern here is the effect of the combination of them on the pulse .",
    "we find that the curvature effect+band spectrum can indeed result in such an anti - correlated trend of @xmath112 .     relation .",
    "the solid lines are for 4 channels of batse considered , while the dashed lines for 1 , 2 and 3 channels case .",
    "the latter is considered due to the fact that the fitted @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in statistical part of the paper are obtained mainly using channels 1 , 2 and 3 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have selected 51 well - separated long - duration fred grb pulses from the available sample of batse and analyzed the pulse temporal and spectral parameters with the aim to search for their connections .",
    "our analysis first shows that the pulse width , pulse rise width and pulse decay width with energy all scale as a power law with the power - law slopes of @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the slopes are correlated to each other but the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is much stronger than that of @xmath2 and @xmath0 as well as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which may be due to the pulse width is dominated by the decay phase and the rise and decay phase have different origins .",
    "then we investigate the relations between the power - law indices and the three band spectral parameters .",
    "our results show that the power - law indices , @xmath2 , @xmath1 are strongly correlated with the low - energy index @xmath3 and much less correlated with high energy slope @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 weakly correlates with @xmath4 but does not show apparent correlated with @xmath3 .",
    "we do not find that there are apparent correlated relations between the peak energy @xmath5 and three power - law indices based on our current sample ( see , figure 7 and table 4 ) .",
    "however , we think the demonstrations that @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are independent of @xmath5 may be weak only based on our current sample .",
    "several reasons may cause the case .",
    "firstly , it is well known that the batse @xmath5 distribution is narrow ( e.g. band et al .",
    "1993 , mallozzi et al .",
    "1995 , schafer 2003 ) , and thus it can be hard to clearly identify the correlations in data drawn from a narrow distribution .",
    "secondly , the sample is likely biased toward low @xmath5-valued pulses .",
    "the sampled pulses have been selected on the basis of long durations and bright peak fluxes . because of pulse property correlations , such pulses tend to be softer than the mean ( hakkila and preece , 2011 ) .",
    "this pulse selection bias can have contributed to the narrowness of the sample .",
    "lastly , some of the highest @xmath5 pulses in this sample may have been incorrectly identified as single pulses , when in actuality they represent merged pulses . if the hard - to - soft pulse evolution demonstrated by peng et al .",
    "( 2009a ) is normal , then a pulse made from two merged pulsed will experience a re - hardening when the second pulse kicks in ( hakkila and preece 2011 ; ukwatta 2011 ) , which can give these pulses higher @xmath5 values than the other single pulses to which they are being compared . due to the bad fits to those merged pulses with given pulse model we are not sure how the merging of pulses affects the @xmath113 values from the data analysis .",
    "but we can give some reasonable deductions .",
    "firstly , it seems that the smallest @xmath113 value from a merged pulse occurs when pulses overlap completely ( i.e. when they peak at the same time ) .",
    "otherwise , the pulses should appear to be longer in all energy channels , and the pulse separation will make a larger contribution to the pulse broadening than the energy - dependent broadening embedded within it .",
    "secondly , we find that the correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath113s are still positive and the correlations get much weaker after removing those merged pulses with high @xmath5 values . therefore ,",
    "if the merged pulses can cause high @xmath5 and the positive correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath113s indeed exist the overlapping pulses may also make the @xmath113s small . based on the above analysis we think the merged pulses would make the @xmath113 values decrease . in order to identify further the correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath113s more wider energy band and cleaner singe pulse data are needed .",
    "we further investigate the implications of the statistical relations .",
    "we find that the energy dependence of decay width ( also the pulse width since it is dominated by the decay section ) can be caused by the curvature effect+band spectrum .",
    "usually we study the observed light curve for a given energy or energy internal ( e.g. , batse has 4 energy channels ) .",
    "the light curve decays due to the delay arrival of high - latitude photons with lower flux , i.e. , curvature effect . for a given observed energy less than the peak energy of band spectrum",
    ", the intrinsic photon energy contributing to the energy will move from low energy part of band spectrum to high energy one due to the lower doppler factor at high latitude .",
    "this will naturally lead to the energy dependence of decay width and thus the pulse width .",
    "this in turn supports the decay phase is indeed due to the curvature effect , or at least related to it .",
    "in addition , different band function parameters may lead to the different degree of pulse broadening .",
    "the main effect seems to be from the low - energy slope as analyzed above .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 also appears to result from the curvature effect and band spectrum ( see fig.[a - d relation ] ) .",
    "the rise phase of the grb pulse contributes less to the pulse width than the decay phase .",
    "however it is important and is considered to be relevant to the hydrodynamic time of shock crossing shell .",
    "statistical studies have found that the rise phase is also related to the time - resolved band spectrum in single pulse .",
    "for instance , some authors found that the time - resolved peak energy of pulse is tracking the pulse profile within a pulse for some bursts ( kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ; peng et al .",
    "2009b , however , see hakkila & preece 2011 for different view ) .",
    "in current investigations , we did nt find correlations between broadening of the rise phase and the ( time - integrated ) band spectrum parameters for different pulses , suggesting that the formation of the rise phase is related to emission mechanism , while its energy dependence is independent of emission mechanism .",
    "the energy dependence of rise phase may arise from the intrinsic spectral evolution .",
    "as pointed by fenimore & sumner ( 1997 ) , the intrinsic spectral evolution affects the rise phase much more significant than the decay phase .",
    "a deduction of the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 we found is that the energy dependence of pulse with single power law ( corresponding to @xmath109 in band spectrum ) spectrum is systematically weaker than that with band spectrum .",
    "if it is verified , this will support that the intrinsic band spectrum and the curvature effect is indeed an important factor leading to the photon energy dependence of grb pulses .",
    "also it in turn supports that the decay phase of pulse is produced by the curvature effect",
    ". we will consider it in a future paper with fermi / gbm or konus - wind data .",

    "<S> previous studies have found that the width of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) pulse is energy dependent and that it decreases as a power - law function with increasing photon energy . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the relation between the energy dependence of pulse and the so - called band spectrum by using a sample including 51 well - separated fast rise and exponential decay long - duration grb pulses observed by batse ( burst and transient source experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first decompose these pulses into rise , and decay phases and find the rise widths , and the decay widths also behavior as a power - law function with photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> then we investigate statistically the relations between the three power - law indices of the rise , decay and total width of pulse ( denoted as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) and the three band spectral parameters , high - energy index ( @xmath3 ) , low - energy index ( @xmath4 ) and peak energy ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that ( 1)@xmath3 is strongly correlated with @xmath2 and @xmath1 but seems uncorrelated with @xmath0 ; ( 2)@xmath4 is weakly correlated with the three power - law indices and ( 3)@xmath5 does not show evident correlations with the three power - law indices . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the origin of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the curvature effect and the intrinsic band spectrum could naturally lead to the energy dependence of grb pulse width and also the @xmath6 and @xmath7 correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our results would hold so long as the shell emitting gamma rays has a curve surface and the intrinsic spectrum is a band spectrum or broken power law . the strong @xmath6 correlation and inapparent correlations between @xmath0 and three band spectral parameters also suggest that the rise and decay phases of grb pulses have different origins . </S>"
