    "assuming that cosmic ray ( cr ) protons are injected at the shock front of a nova explosion at a constant rate with an energy spectrum @xmath9 , such that the total energy stored in cr protons over the source lifetime of the ejecta , @xmath10 , is : @xmath11 we define the cr proton production efficiency factor : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total kinetic energy of the ejecta , hence : @xmath14    cr protons injected at the shock front are advected downstream , where they interact with the ambient plasma through proton - proton ( @xmath15 ) interactions , and may eventually escape diffusively .",
