    "the discovery of graphene@xcite has marked the beginning of a new chapter in condensed matter physics , with the appearance of new fundamental concepts and materials with unconventional properties .",
    "we have known about other genuine 2d materials like the transition metal dichalcogenides , and we have learned about the features hidden in the band structure of the topological insulators@xcite . lately",
    ", we have also seen the discovery of 3d dirac semimetals which are the higher - dimensional analog of graphene@xcite , and we have witnessed the ongoing search of weyl semimetals with a built - in breakdown of parity and time - reversal invariance .    in the above instances , most part of the unconventional features of the materials come from the peculiar geometrical and topological properties of the band structure",
    ". moreover , these are electron systems that are prone to being placed in the strong coupling regime , with a large relative strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "graphene should be a clear example of electron system with strong interaction , given the large ratio between the square of the electron charge and the fermi velocity in the 2d material .",
    "however , graphene is not a prototype of strongly correlated system , even in the case of the free - standing material in vacuum , as experimental observations have shown no sign of electronic instability down to very low doping levels@xcite .    on the other hand , most part of theoretical studies@xcite",
    "have estimated that 2d dirac semimetals should have an excitonic instability at a critical point below the maximum interaction strength attained in graphene suspended in vacuum .",
    "the absence of any signature of a gap in the electronic spectrum , even below the mev scale , is certainly a puzzling evidence regarding the behavior of the 2d material .",
    "given that the theoretical analyses have been mainly based on a ladder approximation to the electron self - energy corrections , the discrepancy between theory and experiment calls into question the use of such approximate methods in electron systems that are placed in the strong - coupling regime@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we apply a nonperturbative approach to the investigation of the effects of the coulomb interaction in both 2d and 3d semimetals , with the aim of mapping more confidently the different phases that may appear in those electron systems .",
    "more precisely , we carry out the self - consistent resolution of the schwinger - dyson equations for the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) of 2d and 3d dirac semimetals , in which the scalar part of the electromagnetic potential is used to mediate in each case the long - range @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction .",
    "this approach has to be implemented in general with some kind of truncation to guarantee its practical feasibility . in this regard ,",
    "we have relied on a formulation of the equations that amounts to including all kinds of diagrammatic contributions except those containing vertex corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the solutions obtained in this way account for the renormalization of all the quasiparticle parameters , giving rise to frequency and momentum - dependent forms of the quasiparticle weight , the fermi velocity and the dynamical dirac fermion mass .    in this framework , we will see that 2d dirac semimetals have just a strong - coupling instability characterized by exciton condensation ( and dynamical generation of mass ) that we find at a critical coupling well above the estimates based on a ladder approximation , thus explaining the absence of that instability in free - standing graphene samples . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that 3d dirac semimetals have a richer phase diagram , with a strong - coupling instability leading to dynamical mass generation up to @xmath0 = 4 and a line of critical points for larger values of @xmath0 characterized by the vanishing of the electron quasiparticle weight in the low - energy limit@xcite .",
    "we will see that such a critical behavior marks the transition to a strongly correlated liquid , characterized by noninteger scaling dimensions that imply the absence of a pole in the electron propagator and are the signature of non - fermi liquid behavior with no stable electron quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "we focus on the qed of dirac semimetals , for which the fermi velocity @xmath2 is much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "the dynamics of these systems can be then described by the interaction of a number @xmath0 of four - component dirac spinor fields @xmath3 representing the electron quasiparticles and the scalar part @xmath4 of the electromagnetic potential . in principle",
    ", each spinor can represent the electronic states around a different dirac point in momentum space , but we will not make more explicit such a discrimination as it does not play any role in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in general as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a set of dirac matrices satisfying @xmath7 ( with the minkowski metric in @xmath8 dimensions @xmath9 ) .",
    "the expression ( [ ham ] ) holds equally well for dimension @xmath10 and @xmath11 , but the propagator of the @xmath12 field is very different in the two cases .",
    "the scalar field has to mediate the @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction with long - range coulomb potential @xmath13 , irrespective of the spatial dimension . at @xmath10 ,",
    "this leads to a bare propagator @xmath14 for the @xmath12 field @xmath15 while in 3d space the bare propagator is instead @xmath16    the effects of the interaction can be characterized through the corrections undergone by the scalar and the dirac field propagators .",
    "the full dirac propagator @xmath17 has in general a representation of the form @xmath18 in terms of a self - energy correction @xmath19 that contributes to renormalize the bare quasiparticle parameters .",
    "this object is given in turn by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the full propagator of the scalar potential and @xmath22 represents the irreducible three - point vertex .",
    "more precisely , this function is defined by the expectation value @xmath23 where 1pi means that we must take the irreducible part of the correlator .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 has also its own equation representing it in terms of the full propagators and the irreducible vertex .",
    "we can write @xmath24 with the polarization @xmath25 being given by @xmath26 \\label{pi}\\ ] ] moreover , the form of the irreducible vertex @xmath22 is constrained by the ward identity arising from the reduced gauge invariance of the model , admitting also a representation in terms of the full propagators@xcite .",
    "the expressions ( [ si ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) correspond to the schwinger - dyson equations of the model .",
    "together with a suitable representation of the irreducible vertex , they may lead to valuable information about the form of the full fermion and interaction propagators .",
    "in general , however , one has to resort to some kind of truncation to achieve a self - consistent resolution of the integral equations . in what follows",
    ", we will apply a common procedure , the so - called bare vertex approximation , by which @xmath22 is set equal to the unit matrix in the resolution of ( [ si ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "we note that this truncation does not satisfy the mentioned ward identity , which relates the irreducible vertex to the derivative with respect to the frequency of the fermion self - energy . in this regard ,",
    "the present work focuses on the investigation of dynamical effects in the renormalization of the quasiparticle parameters , which could be further improved by introducing a suitable ansatz for the vertex ( in similar fashion as in the fully relativistic qed@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the relevant features reported below within our approach are consistent with the results found by means of renormalization group methods@xcite , which supports the present formulation .",
    "the main advantage of adopting the mentioned truncation is that it leads to a very convenient implementation of the self - consistent approach , allowing us to attain easily convergence in the recursive resolution of the schwinger - dyson equations .    without the vertex corrections ,",
    "( [ si ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) lead indeed to closed self - consistent equations , shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "this representation allows us to establish a comparison with other standard approaches used to deal with many - body corrections . in particular , it becomes clear that the contributions accounted for by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ one ] have a much more comprehensive content than other approaches dealing with the rpa sum of bubble diagrams for the polarization .",
    "this makes the present computational scheme much more reliable to describe the electron system away from the weak - coupling regime , incorporating effects like the renormalization of the fermi velocity and the quasiparticle weight which are essential to capture the different critical points of the dirac semimetals .",
    "the integral equations represented in fig . [ one ] can be solved numerically by applying a recursive procedure , after rotating first all the frequencies in the complex plane , @xmath27 , to make the passage to a euclidean space in the variables @xmath28 . in practice",
    ", the integrals can be done numerically by discretizing the frequency and momentum variables . by choosing a set of frequencies @xmath29 with @xmath30",
    ", we can interpret such a discretization as the result of placing the theory at finite temperature @xmath31 . on the other hand , computing with a grid in momentum space is equivalent to describing a system with finite spatial size . in this case",
    ", we can check the finite - size scaling of the results in order to extrapolate the behavior over large distances .    for the self - consistent resolution",
    ", it becomes convenient to represent the fermion propagator in terms of renormalization factors @xmath32 for the electron wave - function and @xmath33 for the fermi velocity , adding moreover another factor @xmath34 to allow for the dynamical generation of a mass for the dirac fermions .",
    "thus we write the full dirac propagator in the form @xmath35 in this way , the resolution consists in finding the functions @xmath36 and @xmath34 that attain the self - consistency in the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "one more important detail is that the polarization @xmath25 may develop spurious divergences when computing the momentum integrals with a simple cutoff @xmath37 . in general ,",
    "only a gauge - invariant regularization scheme can produce results without non - physical power - law dependences on the cutoff@xcite .",
    "these are anyhow additive contributions to the polarization , which makes possible to get rid of them by a suitable subtraction procedure .",
    "thus , computing with the momentum cutoff , the polarization at @xmath10 shows a contribution proportional to @xmath37 , while the corresponding function at @xmath38 has terms growing as large as @xmath39 . in our self - consistent resolution , we have carried out the frequency integrals first with a cutoff @xmath40 , implementing afterwards the subtraction procedure to remove the power - law dependences on @xmath41 from the polarization . in this way",
    ", we have ended up with expressions of @xmath25 that are functionals of the renormalization factors , displaying leading behaviors at small @xmath42 proportional to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , for @xmath10 and @xmath38 .",
    "solving the schwinger - dyson equations at @xmath10 , we find in general that the function @xmath32 giving the quasiparticle weight remains bounded , while @xmath33 diverges in the limit of small momentum @xmath45 .",
    "as long as the effective fermi velocity depends on the momentum scale , it is convenient to define the bare value @xmath46 , which can be taken as a good measure of the fermi velocity at the microscopic scale ( it is always verified that @xmath47 ) .",
    "we can then define the unrenormalized coupling giving the bare interaction strength as @xmath48 which can take different values depending on the particular fermi velocities of the 2d dirac semimetals .    as an illustration of the general behavior , fig .",
    "[ two ] represents the solution obtained for @xmath32 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , that is , for parameters that should be appropriate to describe graphene samples suspended in vacuum .",
    "the resolution has been carried out taking a discretization of the frequency variables such that @xmath52 ev . in this case , the self - consistency in the equations is only attained when @xmath34 is set identically equal to zero .",
    "the behavior found for @xmath32 and @xmath33 is in agreement with the general trend obtained from renormalization group methods , which found the divergence of the fermi velocity in the low - energy limit as a most relevant feature@xcite .    for comparison ,",

    "this is characteristic of correlated systems in low dimensions , where the interactions may drive into a non - fermi liquid phase with nontrivial scaling exponents@xcite .",
    "our system provides in this respect an example of such a behavior at @xmath38 , illustrating moreover the transition to the strongly correlated phase from the renormalized fermi liquid , which is the phase of 3d dirac semimetals at sufficiently weak coupling .",
    "we have seen that the behavior of 2d and 3d dirac semimetals is governed by quite different effects in their respective strong - coupling regimes . in our approach to the 2d semimetals , there is in general a tendency of the fermi velocity of quasiparticles to grow large in the low - energy limit , in agreement with the renormalization group studies carried out in the large-@xmath0 approximation@xcite . in the case of the 3d dirac semimetals , we observe instead that the electron system is prone to develop an attenuation of the quasiparticle weight , with a less significant renormalization of the fermi velocity .",
    "this tendency has been also identified in the large-@xmath0 limit of the 3d dirac semimetals , which shows the existence of a critical coupling characterized by the divergence of the electron scaling dimension@xcite .    in the 2d dirac semimetals ,",
    "the divergence of the fermi velocity in the low - energy limit is the dominant feature that explains for instance the absence of significant correlation effects in the graphene layer .",
    "our nonperturbative solution of the schwinger - dyson equations incorporates naturally the scaling of the fermi velocity , allowing us to reach very good agreement with the experimental measures from graphene samples at very low doping levels@xcite . as a result of such a renormalization",
    ", we have found that the interaction strength has to be set to relatively large values , above those attained in the suspended graphene samples , in order to open up a phase with exciton condensation and dynamical generation of a gap in the 2d dirac semimetals .",
    "the picture changes into a richer phase diagram for the 3d dirac semimetals , as a consequence of the interplay between the attenuation of the electron quasiparticles that prevails at large @xmath0 and the tendency to dynamical mass generation ( analogous to the chiral symmetry breaking of the fully relativistic qed@xcite ) that is dominant at small @xmath0 .",
    "both effects seem to coexist at the interface found for a number of dirac fermions @xmath109 .",
    "most interestingly , our self - consistent resolution has also revealed the phase of the system above the large-@xmath0 critical point , allowing us to characterize the properties of a strongly correlated liquid that is reminiscent of other systems with suppression of electron quasiparticles making the transition from marginal fermi liquid@xcite to non - fermi liquid behavior@xcite .",
    "we remark that our analysis of the 3d dirac semimetals can be extended to map also the large-@xmath0 regime of 3d weyl semimetals .",
    "these are a class of semimetals in which a number of weyl points host fermions with a given chirality , represented in terms of two - component spinors .",
    "this means that a self - consistent resolution of the schwinger - dyson equations may be also carried out for these systems , writing now the full propagator of the weyl fermions around a given weyl point as @xmath110 we may parallel the above approach to predict the existence of a phase with suppression of electron quasiparticles , similar to that found for the 3d dirac semimetals and covering the right part of the phase diagram in fig .

    "( taken now as the number of pairs of weyl points ) , a strong - coupling phase corresponding to fermion condensation may also arise , with an order parameter mixing fermions at different weyl points as in ( [ dij ] ) .",
    "the strength of this instability can not be assessed generically , however , since it may be highly dependent on the particular overlapping of spinors from different weyl points .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect a strong - coupling symmetry broken phase for 3d weyl semimetals at small @xmath0 , with a phase boundary determined by the particular form of the spinors in the material hosting the weyl points .",
    "we finally comment on the feasibility to observe the strong - coupling phases of the 3d semimetals , according to the values of the fermi velocity and number of dirac or weyl points found in different materials .",
    "we recall in this regard that the best known examples of 3d dirac semimetals ( na@xmath65bi and cd@xmath65as@xmath66 ) have a number @xmath50 of dirac fermions and fermi velocities that have been measured with certain accuracy@xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion shows in both cases an anisotropy that is reflected in the values of @xmath2 , which may be reduced by a factor of @xmath111 in one of the directions in momentum space@xcite .",
    "we can make conservative estimates of the coupling defined in ( [ defg ] ) by taking the largest fermi velocity in each case , with the result that @xmath112 for na@xmath65bi and @xmath113 for cd@xmath65as@xmath66 .",
    "these couplings turn out to be below the critical coupling for dynamical mass generation , which corresponds to the critical point at @xmath114 for @xmath50 in the phase diagram of fig . [",
    "this places the two mentioned 3d dirac semimetals in the gapless phase , showing that the transition to the regime with dynamical mass generation would require a fermi velocity at least about @xmath115 smaller than the largest value in na@xmath65bi .    on the other hand",
    ", there should be good prospects to observe the strong - coupling phase at large @xmath0 in weyl semimetals .",
    "the most promising candidates for this class are the pyrochlore iridates and taas , which have 12 pairs of weyl points . with the value of the fermi velocity measured for taas@xcite",
    ", the large value of @xmath0 already sets the effective coupling @xmath116 for this material well above the critical coupling for the non - fermi liquid regime , which is at @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "this leads us to expect that such a material should not behave as a regular fermi liquid when observed at filling levels sufficiently close to the weyl points .",
    "in general , we conclude that the strong - coupling phases that we have studied in this paper are not beyond reach , and that they may be found in systems with reasonably low fermi velocities , or with a sufficiently large number of dirac or weyl points already exhibited by several materials .",
