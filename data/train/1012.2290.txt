    "the `` microcalorimeter arrays for a rhenium experiment '' ( mare ) project aims at providing a competitive alternative to the katrin experiment in the effort of measuring the neutrino mass  with a sensitivity as low as 0.1ev .    to date",
    ", the most sensitive experiments were carried out analyzing the  decay in magnetic adiabatic collimation spectrometers with electrostatic filter , yielding an upper limit on the electron anti - neutrino mass of 2.2ev @xcite .",
    "the soon starting experiment katrin will analyze the  beta decay end - point with a much more sensitive electrostatic spectrometer and with an expected statistical sensitivity of about 0.2ev @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments suffer from many systematic uncertainties since the  source is external to the spectrometer and the measured electron energy has to be corrected for the energy lost in exciting atomic and molecular states , in crossing the source , in scattering through the spectrometer , and more .",
    "therefore , to improve the sensitivity , it is necessary to reduce both the systematic and the statistical uncertainties .",
    "because of the large weight of systematics , it is inherent in neutrino mass measurements that confidence in the results can be obtained only through confirmation by independent experiments .",
    "an alternative approach to spectrometry is calorimetry where the beta source is embedded in the detector so that all the energy emitted in the decay is measured , except the one taken away by the neutrino . in this configuration ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties arising from the external electron source are eliminated . on the other hand ,",
    "since calorimeters detect all the decays occurring over the entire beta energy spectrum , the source activity must be limited to avoid spectral distortions and background at the end - point due to pulse pile - up . as a consequence",
    "the statistics near the end - point is limited as well .",
    "direct kinematical neutrino mass experiments look for a deformation in the energy spectrum of visible particles for neutrino kinetic energies in an interval @xmath1 approaching zero ",
    "i.e. at the spectrum end - point @xmath0 .",
    "the fraction of these events in beta decay is only @xmath2 .",
    "the limitation to the statistics may be then partially balanced by using beta decaying isotopes with an end - point energy as low as possible , like , which has the second lowest known transition energy ( @xmath3kev ) .    a perfect practical way to make",
    "a calorimetric measurement is to use thermal detectors . at thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the temperature rise of the detector  measured by a suitable thermometer  is due to the sum of the energy of the emitted electron and of all other initial excitations .",
    "the measurement is then free from the systematics induced by any possible energy loss in the source and is not affected by problems related to decays on excited final states . in principle one",
    "remaining systematics may be due to energy lost in metastable states living longer than the detector integration time which is always more than about 1 .",
    "the microcalorimeter arrays for a neutrino mass experiment ( mare ) project was launched by a large international collaboration in 2005 with the aim of measuring the neutrino mass with a calorimetric approach .",
    "the baseline of the mare project consists in a large array of rhenium based thermal detectors . as discussed in the following section , different options for the isotope",
    "are also being considered .",
    "rhenium is in principle perfectly suited for fabricating thermal detectors .",
    "metallic rhenium crystals undergo a superconducting transition below 1.6k allowing to reach very high sensitivity thanks to the reduced thermal capacity in the superconducting state .",
    "moreover , the lifetime  about @xmath6years  and the natural isotopic abundance of   about 60%  give an ideal decay rate of about 1decay per second per milligram . also dielectric compounds in proper crystalline forms can be used . to date , only two experiments have been carried out with thermal detectors containing : the manu @xcite and mibeta @xcite experiments .",
    "manu used one detector with a ntd thermistor glued to a 1.6 mg metallic rhenium single crystal , while mibeta used an array of eight silicon implanted thermistors with  crystals for a total mass of about 2.2 mg .",
    "both the experiments collected a statistics of about 10@xmath7 decays , yielding limits on  of about 26ev at 95% cl and 15ev at 90% cl , respectively .",
    "the systematics affecting these experiments are still small compared with the statistical error .",
    "lowering these limits requires better performing detectors and larger statistics . from a simple statistical analysis for the 90% cl limit on , @xmath8 , one can write @xcite @xmath9{n_{ev } } } \\left[{\\frac { \\delta e}{q } + \\frac{q}{\\delta e } \\left ( \\frac{3}{10 } \\",
    "f_{pp } + b \\frac{q}{a_\\beta}\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\ ] ] where : i ) @xmath10 is the  activity of each detector .",
    "ii ) @xmath11 is the average background rate for unit energy and for a single detector .",
    "iii ) @xmath12 is the total number of events , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the number of detectors and the measuring time , respectively .",
    "iv ) @xmath15 is the probability that two  decays pile - up and it is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the time resolution , strictly related to the detector rise time .",
    "two decays happening closer than @xmath17 are mistaken as one single decay with energy equal to the sum of the two decay energies .",
    "the frequency of these piling up events is about @xmath18 and their spectrum @xmath19  where @xmath20 is the  spectrum",
    " extends from 0 to about @xmath21 .",
    "v ) finally @xmath1 is the optimal analysis interval given by the largest between the detector energy resolution @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see @xcite for more details ) .    the three terms in eq.([eq : sensitivity ] )",
    "arise respectively from the statistical fluctuations of the , pile - up and background spectra .",
    "eq.([eq : sensitivity ] ) shows the importance of improving the detector energy resolution and of minimizing pile - up by reducing the detector rise time . on the other hand",
    "it shows also that the largest reduction on the limit can only come by substantially increasing the total statistics @xmath24 .",
    "if pile - up and background are kept negligible the sensitivity improves as @xmath25{1/n_{ev}}$ ] . therefore improving the present limit of mibeta and manu by a factor 100 , would require to increase the statistics by a factor @xmath26 , i.e. to collect a statistics of about @xmath27 decays .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the sensitivity can be obtained by montecarlo frequentist approach @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the same montecarlo approach may be used also to investigate the source of systematic uncertainties peculiar to the calorimetric technique : from this study it appears that the most crucial sources are the beta environmental fine structure ( befs ) @xcite , the theoretical spectral shape of the  decay , the background and the pile - up @xcite .",
    "statistical sensitivity of a  neutrino mass calorimetric experiment estimated with both montecarlo ( points ) and analytic ( curves ) approaches , assuming @xmath28    considering only the statistical sensitivity , fig.[fig : sens ] shows the results of both the analytic and the montecarlo approaches for few hypothetical experimental parameters .",
    "the first two rows of tab.[tab : sens ] show the total statistics and exposures @xmath29 required to reach a statistical sensitivity @xmath8 of 0.2 and 0.1ev , respectively , for two plausible experimental configurations .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for example a target neutrino mass statistical sensitivity of 0.2ev could be expected running for 10years @xmath30 rhenium detectors , each with a mass of 10 mg  for an activity of about 10hz  and with energy and time resolutions of about 3ev and 3  respectively .",
    "the total required mass of natural rhenium is about 400 g .",
    "this calls for the use of large arrays  for a total number of channels of the order of 10000  coupled to an appropriate signal multiplexing scheme to avoid running into insurmountable cryogenic and economic problems .",
    "altogether these requirements are about the same as for ixo  the next generation x - ray space observatory  and largely proved to be technically feasible .",
    "the major open issue remains the metallic rhenium absorber coupling to the sensor .",
    "in fact , in spite of the many efforts , persisting technical difficulties prevented from realizing the target performances with rhenium absorbers so far . in order to have a viable alternative to the baseline mare design using rhenium  decay , the mare collaboration is considering the possibility to use  electron capture @xcite .",
    "since the 80s  electron capture ( ec ) decay has been the subject of many experimental investigations as a powerful means for neutrino mass determination thanks to its very low transition energy ",
    "@xmath31 is about 2.5 kev .",
    "decays to @xmath5dy with a half life of about 4570 years and , because of the low transition energy , capture is only allowed from the m shell or higher .",
    "the ec decay may be detected only through the mostly non - radiative atomic de - excitation of the dy atom and from the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) radiation .",
    "there are at least three proposed independent methods to assess the neutrino mass from the  ec decay : 1 ) absolute m capture rates or m / n capture rate ratios @xcite , 2 ) inner bremsstrahlung end - point @xcite , and 3 ) total absorption spectrum end - point @xcite .",
    "practically all the experimental research has focused on the atomic emissions ",
    "photons and electrons  following the ec to exploit the possibility to constrain simultaneously the transition @xmath31 and the neutrino mass from relative probabilities of m and n shell capture or absolute m capture rate ( method 1 ) ) @xcite .",
    "the main limitation to this approach is the relatively large uncertainty on the atomic physics factors involved",
    ". only one experiment measured the  ib ( method 2 ) ) but sensitivity at the end - point was impaired by background @xcite .    on the contrary",
    ", so far there has been no experimental attempt to exploit the third method which consists in studying the end - point of the total absorption spectrum ( or calorimetric spectrum , i.e. where all the energy released in the decay is measured except that carried away by the neutrino ) as proposed by de rujula and lusignoli in @xcite .",
    "the total absorption spectrum is made up of peaks with breit - wigner shapes .",
    "positions and widths correspond to the binding energies and natural widths of the atomic levels from which the electron can be captured , while the relative intensities are given by the relative capture probabilities .",
    "the right side wings of all peaks sum up and contribute to the upper tail of the spectrum which is truncated at @xmath32 , in analogy to what happens for nuclear  decay spectra . in spite of the many experiments , atomic and nuclear details of the  decay are still affected by unknowns which reflect in uncertainties in the expected calorimetric spectrum shape @xcite .",
    "in particular , the various @xmath31 determinations span from 2.2 to 2.8 kev @xcite with a recommended value of about 2.555kev @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : ho - spe ] shows the  ec decay calorimetric spectrum for two hypothetical @xmath31 values and for a choice of atomic parameters found in the literature .",
    "the shown spectrum is convoluted with an instrumental energy resolution @xmath33 of about 2ev .",
    "the effect of a finite neutrino mass is shown in fig.[fig : ho - endpoint ] for a @xmath31 value of 2.555kev .",
    "total absorption spectrum calculated for an energy resolution @xmath34ev and a pile - up fraction @xmath35 . ]     blow up of the spectrum in fig.[fig : ho - spe ] close to the end - point . ]",
    "fraction of events in an energy interval @xmath36ev below the end - point of the total absorption spectrum of  ec decay ( left y - axis and squared ) and neutrino mass statistical sensitivity for @xmath37events , @xmath38 and @xmath39ev ( right y - axis and triangles ) . ]    as for  decay end - point experiments , also in  experiments the sensitivity on the neutrino mass depends on the fraction of events at the end - point : fig.[fig : ho - sens ] shows how this fraction increases for decreasing @xmath31 and how the neutrino mass sensitivity increases accordingly . for the lowest measured @xmath31 values ,",
    "the fraction of events at the end - point is about the same as for .",
    "neutrino mass sensitivity in fig.[fig : ho - sens ] is estimated by montecarlo methods , as in ref.@xcite for  decay ; the parameters of the simulations are reported in the caption . as discussed above ,",
    "calorimetric measurements are always affected by pile - up .",
    "in the case of  the pile - up spectrum is quite complex , being the self convolution of the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : ho - spe ] ( see for example fig.4 in @xcite ) . the sensitivity calculated in fig.[fig : ho - sens ] includes the effect of pile - up .",
    "the loss of sensitivity for a @xmath31 value of about 2.5kev can be explained by the presence of a peak around 2.5kev in the pile - up spectrum .",
    "the effect of this peak can be appreciated on the full curve of fig.[fig : ho - endpoint ] as well .    in order to assess the real potential of the total absorption approach for measuring the neutrino mass with , it is mandatory to precisely measure the @xmath31 value and the relevant atomic parameters ( i.e. natural widths and capture probabilities ) . in case these parameters turn out to be favorable ,",
    "may then represent a very interesting alternative to .",
    "because of the relatively short half life , detectors may be realized by introducing only few  nuclei ( about @xmath40 for 1 decay / s ) in low temperature microcalorimeters optimized for low energy x - ray spectroscopy , without any further modification . given the status - of - the - art and perspectives of this class of microcalorimeters @xcite , the  option of the mare project make reaching very appealing  sensitivities plausible .",
    "last two rows of tab.[tab : sens ] show the total statistics and exposures @xmath29 required to reach a statistical sensitivity @xmath8 of 0.2 and 0.1ev respectively , in the fortunate case @xmath31 is 2.2kev .",
    "for example , a target neutrino mass statistical sensitivity of 0.2ev could be expected running for just one year @xmath41 detectors , each with a  activity of 100decay / s and with energy and time resolutions of about 1ev and 0.1  respectively .",
    "the total number of implanted  nuclei would be about @xmath42 .",
    "the mare project is subdivided into two phases . the second phase ",
    "mare-2  is the final large scale experiment with sub - electron sensitivity .",
    "the first one  mare-1  is a collection of activities with the aim of sorting out both the best isotope and the most suited detector technology to be used for the final experiment .    as discussed above the two competing isotopes",
    "are  and .",
    "the latter lacks the burden of information that have been collected for  over the years .",
    "a small scale experiment is being set - up by the milano , genova and lisbon groups to perform a high statistics calorimetric measurement of the  spectrum .",
    "this will allow to determine the transition energy @xmath31 , to assess the spectrum shape and therefore to estimate the potential for a neutrino mass measurement .",
    "this experiment will use a small array of silicon thermistors with tin absorbers .",
    "the  nuclei will be implanted in tin by means of a process which is currently being defined and tested .    on the  side , the milano group , together with the nasa / gsfc and wisconsin groups ,",
    "has developed arrays of silicon implanted thermistors coupled to 500  absorbers .",
    "the experiment , which is presently being assembled , uses up to 8 xrs2 arrays with 36 pixels each @xcite .",
    "so far , the established energy and time resolutions are about 25ev and 250respectively . with all 288 pixels instrumented , a sensitivity better than about 4ev at 90% cl would be reached in 3 years with a statistics of almost @xmath43 decays .",
    "the purpose of this experiment is to investigate the systematics of  neutrino mass measurements , with a special focus on those caused by the befs , the beta spectrum theoretical shape and the summing of many spectra from an array .",
    "more mare-1 activities are devoted to the design of the single detector for the final mare large scale experiment .",
    "this mainly consists in optimizing the coupling between rhenium crystals  or  implanted absorbers  and sensitive sensors like transition edge sensors ( tes ) , metallic magnetic calorimeters ( mmc ) or kinetic inductance detectors ( mkid ) in particular , groups in genova , miami and lisbon are concentrating their efforts to the optimization of tes , while a group in heidelberg focuses on mmc @xcite .",
    "the same groups are also developing signal multiplexing schemes .",
    "it is realistic to expect the mare-1 phase to conclude with the pinning down of the best isotope and the best detector technique within 2  3 years .",
    "the mare project will then proceed to its second phase beginning with the design and construction of one first large array .",
    "more arrays will then be added and run in different refrigerators within the collaboration .",
