    "the statistical analysis of dna coding and non - coding sequences has revealed structures and correlations that go beyond the extent of short - range models , for example uncovering scale - invariant properties of the sequence as a whole .",
    "results in this direction date back to the early 80 s @xcite . despite these early observations , the functional role and nature ( if any ) of such long - range correlations are still to be clarified @xcite .",
    "other statistical measures on genetic sequences have also been investigated , like entropies @xcite or return time statistics for specific oligonucleotides @xcite .",
    "in particular , the first - return - time distribution proved to be a powerful tool to investigate the statistical properties of symbolic sequences in general .",
    "the idea dates back to the pioneering work of poincar @xcite , on the trajectories of bounded dynamical systems .",
    "thereafter , much effort has been devoted to the analysis of symbolic trajectories in very different contexts : stochastic processes @xcite , biological data @xcite and literary texts @xcite , to mention just a few .",
    "these tools have been applied to genomics in different forms for about the last 10 years @xcite , becoming nowadays rather common , e.g. for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree @xcite , for the detection of cpg islands @xcite and for the characterization of long - range correlations in dna @xcite .    while the identification and quantification of the statistical features of a genetic sequence can be instrumental in understanding certain properties of its primary structure",
    ", a more biologically motivated study can bring new insight on these patterns .",
    "the statistical analysis of dna sequences can reveal functional and structural properties of biological relevance , and also , in principle , universal features that go beyond the single organism , which can help characterize and classify different levels of organism complexity .",
    "it can also help comprehend complex mechanisms such as chromatin structure @xcite and epigenetic regulation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is nowadays recognized that in complex organisms the non - coding regions of dna , the once - called `` junk dna '' , are continuously annotated with novel regulatory functions @xcite",
    ". a deeper knowledge of the characteristics of dna structure ( not only the coding part ) could help understand the effects of some pathologies that involve mutated genes with a structural rather that a functional role , as in the case of laminopathies @xcite .",
    "in this study we employ a distance - based approach to characterize the distribution of dinucleotides inside human and other genomes .",
    "in particular , for a given sequence and a given dinucleotide , we compute the distance ( counted in number of bases ) between two consecutive occurrences of that dinucleotide .    more precisely ,",
    "consider a sequence @xmath0 where @xmath1 take value in the alphabet @xmath2 .",
    "for a given dinucleotide @xmath3 with @xmath4 , construct the sequence of indexes where xy occurs : @xmath5 .",
    "the sequence of inter - distances @xmath6 is then computed from the difference of successive indexes @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to the choice of an overlapping - window frame ( @xmath8 ) , we removed overlapping occurrences , namely , the case of the subsequence @xmath9 is considered as two @xmath10 dinucleotides with a distance of two , and all distances are subtracted by one at the end of the process in order to obtain a minimum distance of 1 . ] . here",
    "we focus on the relative frequencies of such distances , that is : @xmath11    for all the considered organisms , the different sequences of inter - dinucleotide distances @xmath12 , for each of the 16 dinucleotides , were computed from the whole genome sequence obtained by concatenating all chromosomes . note that , since we focus on the probability distribution @xmath13 only , the precise order of the concatenation has a negligible effect on the results .",
    "finally , unknown nucleotides ( corresponding to the symbol @xmath14 on the dna sequence ) were removed from the sequences to be analyzed .",
    "logarithmic and double - logarithmic plots of the distributions were used to visually inspect the exponential or power - law behavior of their tails . moreover",
    ", a quantitative estimation of the differences between dinucleotide distributions was obtained using the jensen - shannon distance @xmath15 , a symmetrized version of the kullback - leibler divergence @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this analysis was performed between dinucleotide distributions for the same organism , and between the distributions of the dinucleotide cg for all the studied organisms .    given two probability distributions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) we have :    @xmath22    21 organisms have been analyzed for this study : _ homo sapiens _ , primates ( _ macaca mulata _ , _ pan troglodytes _ ) , mammals ( _ bos taurus _ , _ canis familiaris _ , _ equus caballus _ , _ monodelphis domesticus _ , _ mus musculus _ , _ rattus norvegicus _ ,",
    "_ ornithorynchus anatinus _ ) , fish ( _ danio rerio _ , _ tetraodon nigroviridis _ ) , insects ( _ apis mellifera _ , _ drosophila melanogaster _ , _ tribolium castaneum _ ) , sea organisms ( _ ciona intestinalis _ , _ oikopleura diotica _ ) , _ caenorhabditis elegans _ , unicellular organisms ( _ escherichia coli _ , _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ) , and a virus ( human _ adenovirus _ ) .",
    "most of the chosen organisms were described in two papers @xcite .",
    "the details on the organisms , and the link to the dna sequence available online , are shown in supplementary table 1 .",
    "custom code was written ( python and matlab software ) to implement data import , processing and analysis .",
    "the characterization of dinucleotide inter - distance distributions in human dna reveals a striking difference of the the dinucleotide cg and all the other couples , as shown in fig .",
    "[ homodna ] , [ sup ] , and in supplementary figure 1 .",
    "the double logarithmic plot shows the presence of `` heavy '' tails in the distributions of all the remaining dinucleotides , with an algebraic decay @xmath23 , with a similar exponent close to @xmath24 ( average exponent @xmath25 ) ( regression correlation coefficient @xmath26 for all distributions , except for cg , see supplementary table 2 also for a chi - square test comparison ) .",
    "in contrast , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ homodna ] , the tail of the cg inter - distance distribution is asymptotically exponentially decaying : @xmath27 with parameter @xmath28 , ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , see table [ tabfit ] ) .    in order to find a biological meaning for such striking differences , we remark that an exponential distribution is associated with a `` characteristic length @xmath31 '' between consecutive appearances of the same dinucleotide , given by the inverse of the exponential rate @xmath32 , with a value of @xmath33 bases for human dna .",
    "cg dinucleotides thus perform a sort of `` bernoulli walk '' along the whole dna sequence , at difference with the other dinucleotides for which a power - law tail implies a scale - invariant distribution .",
    "this result can be associated with the different role that cg dinucleotides have in human dna , since they are the sites in which a methyl group can be attached by the specific enzyme family of dna methyltransferases @xcite .",
    "regarding our analyses , we remark that , since the coding regions of human dna constitute only a small part of the overall sequence ( about @xmath34 ) , our statistics are mainly affected by the features of the non - coding regions , believed to have functional roles for the three - dimensional structure of the chromatin @xcite and for the regulation of transposable elements @xcite . moreover , if we consider a known structure for the dinuclotides cg in human dna , the so - called `` cpg islands '' @xcite ( that seem to have a role in regulating the expression of the contiguous genes @xcite ) , it is known that cg s are at close distance between each other ( inside an island ) . since we are studying the long - range interval of the inter - distance distributions ( the right tail of the distributions ) we can assert that our analyses are not affected by these entities in the interval considered for fitting .          after performing our analyses on the human dna",
    ", we have considered the dna sequence of other organisms for comparison . in this way we aim to find relations between the features of the cg distributions and the biological information actually available on dna methylation mechanisms , for a large class of organisms ( as described in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we remark that many results on dna methylation in living organisms are still unknown , or at least still object of debate .",
    "for all the 21 organisms , we have estimated the inter - distance distributions for all the 16 dinucleotides , and compared the distributions with each other via the jensen - shannon distance .",
    "we observe that a group of 10 organisms , that we can recognize as mammals , has a strikingly different distribution of cg distances , compared to the others ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ sup ] ) .",
    "this difference is particularly evident in the tail of the cg distributions , cf .",
    "figure [ homodna ] for man and mouse .",
    "the remaining 11 organisms show a more heterogeneous behavior , in term of the jensen - shannon distance : for _ adenovirus , apis _ , _ e. coli _ and _ oikopleura _ no clear difference can be seen , while for the other organisms the dinucleotide cg , but also cc , gc and gg , appears different from the other distributions , showing analogous patterns of js distances ( see fig .",
    "[ inf ] ) .",
    "the power of the js distance in differentiating between cg and other dinucleotides can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ dendro ] : a hierarchical clustering of all organism assigns to two distinct groups mammalians and the other organisms .        a plot of two sample organisms , _ drosophila _ and _ e. coli _ , shows that the 16 dinucleotide distributions are not as different between each other as for higher - order organisms ( see fig .",
    "[ ecolidna ] ) .",
    "it might be plausible that , in this group of lower - order organisms , different mechanisms related to cg methylation are present , possibly related to their different degrees of complexity , since this group comprises viruses , bacteria , a yeast strain , insects and fish .         in order to verify the goodness of this hypothesis , and also to compare the different organisms ,",
    "we have generated the cumulative distribution of the cg inter - distances for each organism , and fitted their tails with an exponential function . since _",
    "adenoma _ , _",
    "e. coli _ ,",
    "_ oikopleura _ and _ saccharomices _ have a smaller maximum observed distance ( 517 , 318 , 679 and 308 respectively ) , in these cases we have fitted the whole cg distribution .",
    "[ tabfit ]    the resulting fit parameters are shown in table 1 . as it can be seen , the fit is very good ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) for the group of organisms in fig .",
    "[ homodna ] which showed a different cg distribution .",
    "moreover , for these organisms , the fit parameters are very similar , with a characteristic length ranging from @xmath37 to about @xmath38 bases ( from a minimum of @xmath39 for _ equus _ to a maximum of @xmath40 for mouse ) .",
    "the only exception is _ monodelphis _ , which has a characteristic length of 452 , nearly double the others .",
    "this can be due to the fact that in this organism cpg autosomal density is very different from the other amniotes ( @xmath41 versus @xmath42 @xcite ) .",
    "for the other group of organisms , once again , the situation is more heterogeneous : for example , for _ apis _ and _ danio _ the exponential function seems to fit the empirical data well ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and also the characteristic lengths are comparable with the ones of the first group ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , respectively ) , while _ drosophila _ and _ saccharomices _ have very good fits ( @xmath47 , @xmath44 for s. cerevisiae ) , but their characteristic lengths differ by an order of magnitude ( @xmath48 respectively ) . for other organisms the exponential distribution seems unfit , even if with an heterogeneous degree of dissimilarity ( see supplementary figure 2 for a visual inspection ) .",
    "finally we remark that some small characteristic lengths could be related to the small size of the genome of the organism ( as for _ adenovirus _ , _ e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ ) , but this association between parameter @xmath32 and genome size can not be generalized to the other organisms .",
    "we have characterized the first - return time distributions of dinucleotides in dna sequences , from a large set of organisms with different levels of complexity ( from viruses to primates ) .",
    "what we have found in human dna is a striking difference for the dinucleotide cg : the inter - distance distribution of cg s has an exponential tail , while the distributions for the other dinucleotides exhibit a power - law tail .",
    "an exponential distribution of return times is found in a stochastic process with a characteristic time scale , that in our case represents a characteristic distance between the dinucleotides , which is very different from a process with a power - law distribution of return times .",
    "this feature of the dinucleotide cg might reflect their peculiar functional and structural role inside dna , since cg dinucleotides are known to be the sites for dna methylation , an epigenetic mechanism known to be involved in gene regulation and also in structural conformation of dna chromatin .",
    "we have extended this analysis to other 20 organisms , many of which ( such as mammals ) should be very similar to man in terms of dna processing while others ( like viruses , bacteria and unicellular organisms ) should be very different . finally for the other organisms considered in our study ( such as insects , fish and worms ) , the differences are not in principle so clear .",
    "for example , many of the chosen organisms ( e. coli , c. elegans , honeybee , fruitfly , ciona , tribolium , danio , tetraodon , mouse , man ) are known to have different degrees of functional similarities between each other , in terms of hortologies of the main family of enzymes governing dna methylation processes ( see @xcite ) , but for many of the organisms we studied such information is not actually available .",
    "what we observe is a striking similarity between mammals ( fig .",
    "[ sup ] ) , which are known to have very similar dna methylation processes , and also similar levels of global dna methylation .",
    "the investigation of the cg cumulative distributions in these organisms showed a common exponential distribution for the long - range dinucleotide inter - distances .",
    "moreover , the characteristic lengths associated to these distributions are also consistently similar ( @xmath49 ) , thus suggesting that the common biological mechanisms involved in cg methylation are reflected in the similar dna structure at the scale of dinucleotide inter - distance .    the remaining organisms ( fig .",
    "[ inf ] ) span a larger range of organismal complexity , thus the overall picture appears more heterogeneous from a biological point of view , and this is reflected in our analysis .",
    "for example escherichia coli , a bacterium that does not possess similar epigenetic mechanisms and probably does not exploit dna methylation processes for the same purposes as pluricellular organisms , does not present significant differences between dinucleotide distributions .",
    "the same is true for adenovirus .",
    "this different behavior might be justified by a different role of dna methylation in bacteria , or by the fact that only a small portion of bacterial dna is affected by this process @xcite .",
    "thus , our statistical approach might not be sensitive enough to highlight possible differences .",
    "the case of fruitfly looks similar , since the difference between dinucleotide distributions is not as marked , as shown in the double logarithmic plot of fig .",
    "[ ecolidna ] .",
    "this is consistent with what is known about the very low levels of dna methylation in fruitfly , and the absence of dnmt family hortologs @xcite .",
    "this approach has been exploited to classify organisms in phylogenetic trees @xcite , but our analysis shows that it might also help infer the presence of dna epigenetic mechanisms in poorly characterized organisms , even if a clear association of these observations with specific biological mechanisms is yet to come .",
    "the exponential function used to fit of the cg inter - distance distribution at a whole - genome level seems to highlight a structural role of cgs in higher - level organisms , since it is the signature of a regular `` marking '' along all the dna sequence .",
    "an observation , that in our opinion might deserve deeper investigation , is that the characteristic lengths found in the first group of organisms is comparable to the length typically associated with histones , protein complexes that play a role in chromatin modelling .",
    "it is known that the length of a dna sequence wrapped around histones is the size of the nucleosome plus a variable linker dna region , summing up to about 220 bases , therefore the characteristic length of cg inter - distance could be associated with the positioning of histone positioning along the genome and possibly with three - dimensional structure of dna .",
