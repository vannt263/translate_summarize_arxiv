    "recently , georgi @xcite proposed unparticle stuff which has non - integer scaling dimension @xmath4 and looks like a number of @xmath4 massless invisible particles .",
    "the idea behind is the existence of a non - trivial scale invariant sector beyond the standard model ( sm ) , with non - trivial infrared fixed point and the scaling dimension @xmath4 .",
    "georgi suggested that , at the energy scales around @xmath5 , this sector appears as so called unparticle stuff .",
    "the effective lagrangian can be constructed to describe the interactions of unparticles with the sm fields in the low energy level and this approach opens a window to test the effects of the possible scale invariant sector , experimentally .",
    "the missing energies at various processes which can be measured at lhc or @xmath6 colliders , the dipole moments of fundamental particles and the processes in which the unparticle(s ) appears as mediator are the possible candidates in order to search the effects of unparticle(s ) .",
    "there is various phenomenological work done in the literature on unparticles @xcite-@xcite : their effects on the missing energy of many processes , the anomalous magnetic moments , the electric dipole moments , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mixing , lepton flavor violating interactions , direct cp violation in particle physics ; the phenomenological implications in cosmology and in astrophysics .    in this work",
    ", we study the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays of the randall sundrum ( rs1 ) radion field in the case that the lf violationsm @xcite-@xcite , the lepton mixing mechanism is permitted .",
    "however , the negligibly small branching ratios ( brs ) of lfv decays stimulate one to search for new lf violation mechanisms . in the present work",
    ", we do not take into account the lf violation coming from the possible massive neutrinos . ]",
    "is carried by the scalar unparticle mediation .",
    "the rs1 model is based on the non - factorizable geometry @xcite in the five space - time dimensions and the extra dimension is compactified into @xmath9 orbifold with two 4d brane boundaries . in one of the boundary , the so called planck brane",
    ", the gravity is localized and in the another one , the tev brane , all other fields are restricted .",
    "the size of extra dimension is proportional to the vacuum expectation of a scalar field and its fluctuation over the expectation value is called the radion field that has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite-@xcite . here",
    ", we predict the brs of the lfv decays in the framework of the rs1 scenario , by using the effective lagrangian in order to insert the possible scalar unparticle mediation .",
    "we observe that the brs of the processes we study are strongly sensitive to the unparticle scaling dimension @xmath4 and , for its small values @xmath10 , the brs enhance considerably .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the the effective lagrangian and effective vertices which drive the lfv decays with scalar unparticle mediation , by respecting the rs1 scenario .",
    "furthermore , we give the expression for their brs .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the discussion and to our conclusions . in the appendix ,",
    "we present the interaction vertices including the radion field .",
    "the lfv processes are among the rare decays in the sense that they exist at least in the one loop level and their brs are small .",
    "however , their existence in the loop level makes them worthwhile to analyze since physical quantities related to them contain considerable information about the model used and the free parameters existing . in the present work",
    ", we study the lfv decays of the radion field , in the framework of the rs1 scenario .",
    "here we assume that the lf violation is carried by the unparticle stuff which is introduced by georgi @xcite .",
    "the starting point of the idea is the interaction of two sectors , the sm and the ultraviolet sector with non - trivial infrared fixed point , at high energy level .",
    "the ultraviolet sector appears as new degrees of freedom , called unparticles , being massless and having non integral scaling dimension @xmath4 around , @xmath5 .",
    "this mechanism results in the existence of the effective field theory with effective lagrangian in the low energy level and the corresponding lagrangian reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unparticle operator , the parameter @xmath13 is related to the energy scale of ultraviolet sector , the low energy one and the matching coefficient @xcite and @xmath14 is the space - time dimension .    at this stage",
    ", we would like to give a brief explanation about the rs1 scenario and the effective lagrangian which is responsible for the lfv decay underconsideration .",
    "the rs1 model is formulated in the warped extra dimension , which is compactified into @xmath9 orbifold . there",
    "exist two 4d surfaces ( branes ) , which are boundaries of the extra dimension , in 5d world .",
    "one of the brane is called the planck brane where the gravity , extending into the bulk with varying strength , peaks near and the other one is called the tev brane where we live .",
    "the considered behavior of the gravity results in the explanation of the well known hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition to this , the cosmological constant problem is solved with the help of the equal and opposite tensions in these two branes .",
    "the background metric of this 5d world is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the bulk curvature constant , @xmath18 is the extra dimension parametrized as @xmath19 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath20 with the inter brane separation @xmath21 , is the warp factor which ensures that all the mass terms are rescaled in the tev brane . with a rough estimate @xmath22 the hierarchy problem",
    "is solved and all mass terms are pulled down to the tev scale . in this scenario , the radion field appears as fluctuation over the expectation value of the field @xmath23 that its vacuum expectation value is related to the size @xmath24 of extra dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the field @xmath23 should acquire a mass not to have a conflict with the equivalence principle and , the radion field can be stabilized with a mechanism , proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite . including the radial fluctuations , the metric in 5d is defined as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 the scalar field , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the normalized radion field ( see for example @xcite )",
    ". finally , the the induced metric at the orbifold point @xmath29 ( tev brane ) reads , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs boson .    here , we are ready the construct the effective interaction lagrangian for the lfv decays we study . notice that we choose the appropriate operators with lowest possible dimension since they have the most powerful effect in the low energy effective theory ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the part of the effective lagrangian which is responsible for the lf violation reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lepton field , @xmath36 is the scalar unparticle ( _ u _ ) operator and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) coupling .",

    "since the fv radion decays , @xmath48 , can exist at least in one loop level ( see fig.[figselfvert ] ) , one needs the scalar unparticle propagator which is obtained by using the scale invariance .",
