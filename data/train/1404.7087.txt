    "[ fig-1](a ) and ( b ) that for @xmath64 the peak density has increased , whereas the extent of the density profile has slightly decreased as compared to @xmath63 case .",

    "<S> an initial asymmetry in the locations of the vortices can lead to different decay rates for the constituent vortices as is the case for the condensates interacting via pure contact interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the anisotropic interaction between the component vortices manifests itself as the perceptible difference in the trajectories traversed by the vortices in the condensate at finite temperatures . </S>"
