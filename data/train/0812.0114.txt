    "stellar collapse results from the evolution of a massive star.@xcite all stars spend most of their lives burning hydrogen to helium in a central core , but in those with mass @xmath21 ( eight times the solar mass ) the helium ash eventually ignites and burns to carbon , and then perhaps to oxygen and magnesium . for @xmath22 additional core burning stages occur with increasing density and temperature , culminating with the production of iron - group nuclei ; these lie near the top of the nuclear binding energy curve , and so no further energy can be extracted by nuclear fusion .    in very rough caricature , burning to higher - mass nuclear species tends to proceed , at least at first , by successive captures of @xmath23 particles ( helium nuclei with proton number @xmath24 and mass number @xmath25 , that is , @xmath26he ) .",
    "two factors favor this .",
    "first , helium nuclei are unusually tightly bound , and this tends to make their presence in relatively high abundance energetically favorable .",
    "second , their modest proton number makes for a less formidable coulomb barrier : it is much easier for an @xmath23 particle to approach a higher - mass nucleus than it is for two higher - mass nuclei to approach each other .",
    "the dominant naturally - occuring isotope of iron is @xmath27fe , whose mass number @xmath28 is indeed an integer multiple of 4 .",
    "while it is not the most tightly bound nucleus overall,@xcite it is the most tightly bound nucleus near the valley of @xmath29 stability,@xcite which tends towards greater neutron richness with higher @xmath30 because of the increasingly high coulomb energy of confined protons .",
    "the synthesis of @xmath27fe is not merely an unbroken sequence of @xmath23 captures .",
    "a variety of strong and electromagnetic interactions occur ; these include fusion of higher - mass species when @xmath23 particles are scarce , but the high temperatures required by the associated high coulomb barriers also induce photodissociation that replenishes the @xmath23 particle abundance , enabling the predominant role of species whose mass numbers are multiples of 4 .",
    "moreover , the neutron excess manifest in @xmath27fe requires the conversion of two protons to neutrons for each nucleus of this isotope , and so weak interactions must also occur along the way .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption that the stellar core burns all the way to @xmath31fe , with a prominent role for @xmath23 capture , allows the pre - collapse iron core temperature @xmath32 to be estimated .",
    "the first step in this estimate is to understand the relationship between temperature and the most favorable energy @xmath33 for a nuclear reaction to proceed , which is typically higher than @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is boltzmann s constant ) .",

    "catastrophic collapse ensues when the iron core becomes sufficiently massive that it can no longer be supported against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure . as the mass and density of the iron core increase during the final burning stages ,",
    "the velocity of the degenerate electrons approaches the speed of light ; after this , the electrons contribution to pressure support can not be further increased .",
    "an estimate of the core s maximum mass follows from consideration of a uniform core whose pressure support comes solely from a degenerate fermi gas of relativistic electrons .",
    "the number of electrons in the core is @xmath73 where @xmath4 now denotes the mass of the core rather than the mass of the entire star , and the electron fraction @xmath74 is the ratio of the net number density of electrons @xmath75 ( or , by charge neutrality , the total number density of protons @xmath76 ) to the total baryon number density @xmath77 .",

    "the vigorous onset of electron capture ",
    "one proximate cause of the core s instability as it approaches the chandrasekhar mass  can be used to estimate the density of the iron core just before collapse .",
    "this new physical input is needed because , in a uniform - density model , the density follows from knowledge of the radius @xmath5 , which cancelled out of the estimate of the core mass @xmath4 in the previous section .",
    "electron capture @xmath86 begins in earnest when the electron fermi energy @xmath87 rises above the energy threshold required to convert a proton to a neutron_when both of these baryons are bound in a nucleus_.    hence calculation of the energy threshold for electron capture requires some model of the nucleus ; fortunately , the concept of degeneracy once again facilitates a simple estimate . crudely considering a nucleus of proton number @xmath88 and mass number @xmath30 as consisting of degenerate fermi gases of non - relativistic protons and neutrons confined to a volume of radius @xmath89 ,",
