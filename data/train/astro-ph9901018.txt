    "non - thermal hard x - ray radiation ( hxr ) is predicted in galaxy clusters with radio haloes , such as coma c in the central region of the coma cluster ( willson 1970 ) , due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by relativistic electrons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "the combined radio and hxr detections directly yield an estimate of the mean volume - averaged intracluster magnetic field , b , and of the electron energy density , @xmath4 .",
    "actually , to obtain informations on @xmath4 , knowledge of the size of the radio source and of the distance of the cluster are also needed .",
    "it is worth remarking that the procedure is based essentially only on observables .",
    "an accurate estimate of magnetic fields and electron and proton densities present in clusters of galaxies is essential for a clearer picture of the intracluster environment . in particular , these quantities are crucial to establish the role of magnetic fields on the cluster dynamical history and the contribution of the relativistic particles to the intracluster gas heating ( rephaeli 1979 ) .    here",
    "we present the first detection of hard x - ray emission from the coma cluster , obtained by ( boella 1997 ) .",
    "preliminary results have already been presented by fusco - femiano ( 1998 ) . the coma cluster was observed in december 1997 for an exposure time of @xmath5 ksec .",
    "here we discuss results from the two passively collimated instruments , the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) , whose energy range is 4 - 120 kev , and the phoswich detection system ( pds ) , working in the 15 - 200 kev energy range .    the main aim of this long observation was to search for non - thermal hard x - ray radiation exploiting the unique capabilities of the pds : an overall sensitivity better than a few times @xmath6 in the 40 - 80 kev energy band , a relatively small field of view ( fwhm=@xmath7 , hexagonal ) , a wide 15 - 200 kev energy range , a low and stable background thanks to the equatorial orbit .",
    "the cluster was also observed with the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) , an imaging instrument working in the 1.5 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "here we briefly summarize the results that will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy was performed on the core of the cluster with concentric annuli of @xmath8 within a region @xmath9 in radius ( @xmath0325 kpc ) .",
    "there is no evidence for variations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) temperature and metallicity in the observed region .",
    "the average temperature was determined to be @xmath10 kev , while the average iron abundance is 0.26@xmath110.02 .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that an angular distance of @xmath14 corresponds to 40.6 kpc ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "quoted confidence intervals are @xmath16 level , if not otherwise specified .",
    "the pds and the hpgspc instruments use the rocking collimator technique for background subtraction with angles of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in the pds ,",
    "the standard observation strategy is to observe the x - ray target with one collimator and to monitor the background level on both sides of the source position with the other , so that a continuous monitoring of the source and background is obtained .",
    "the standard dwell time in each position of both collimators is 96 sec .",
    "the background level of the pds is the lowest obtained thus far with high energy instruments onboard satellites , thanks to the equatorial orbit . in the 15 - 300 kev energy band ,",
    "the background is @xmath19 ( frontera 1997 ) .",
    "the background is very stable , again thanks to the favourable orbit , and no modelling of the time variation of the background is required .",
    "counts are excluded from the analysis for 300 sec after the passage of the satellite through the trapped radiation of the south atlantic geomagnetic anomaly . in the hpgspc",
    "the collimator assumes on and off - source position with the same dwell time of the pds ( manzo 1997 ) .",
    "the correctness of the pds background subtraction has been checked by verifying that the counts fluctuate about zero flux as the signal falls below detectability .",
    "this happens at energies greater than @xmath080 kev .",
    "two broad strong features peaked at @xmath030 kev and @xmath060 kev are present in the pds background spectrum ( frontera 1997 ) .",
    "however , even excluding the counts in the energy bands of these features , hard x - ray radiation is still detectable .",
    "the pds detected hard x - ray emission in the 15 - 80 kev energy range in the coma cluster spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . we started the spectral analysis by working only with the pds data to have a robust indication of the presence of a non - thermal component in the observed hxr radiation .",
    "the mecs data are not very helpful in this respect , as its field of view is much smaller than that of the pds . with the pds data",
    "alone , however , it is not possible to perform complex spectral fits , and one has to resort to fixing the temperature of the intracluster medium .",
    "different temperatures , in the range 7.5 - 8.5 kev , have been reported by previous x - ray observatories for the coma cluster ( hughes 1988 ; hughes , gorenstein & fabricant 1988 ; watt 1992 ; hughes 1993 ) , but with a clear pattern : the larger the field of view , the lower the measured temperature . by fixing the temperature of the thermal component to the average cluster value of 8.21 kev , as determined by the large area counter ( lac ) experiment onboard ( whose field of view of @xmath20 is not much different from that of the pds )",
    ", we obtain the fit shown in figure 1 .",
    "adopting a temperature as high as 9.1 kev , as observed by the mecs in the cluster core , the results are substantially the same .",
    "the flux of the thermal component is @xmath21 in the 2 - 10 kev energy range ; the reduced @xmath22 of the fit is 3.2 for 9 degrees of freedom , mainly due to a clear excess above 25 kev at a 4.5 @xmath1 level .",
    "leaving the temperature as free parameter , a value of kt=10.73@xmath23 is obtained ; the reduced @xmath22 is 2.14 for 8 degrees of freedom . the @xmath22 value decreases significantly when a second component is added .",
    "modelling this further component as a power law , as for non - thermal emission , the reduced @xmath22 value is 0.92 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the confidence interval for the power law spectral index is rather large , 0.7 - 3.6 , but the flux ( @xmath24 in the 20 - 80 kev energy range ) , does not depend much on the power law index . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider a second thermal component , instead of the non - thermal one , the fit requires a temperature greater than 40 kev .",
    "this unrealistic value may be interpreted as a strong indication that the detected hard excess is due to a non - thermal mechanism .",
    "it is worth remarking that the x - ray fluxes measured by and pds coincide , within the errors , in their common energy range 15 - 20 kev , where the flux is still dominated by the icm thermal component .",
    "the contribution of the non - thermal component is not greater than 20@xmath25 at 20 kev , even adopting the rather steep value of 2.34 ( see @xmath26 4 ) for the spectral index of the hard flux .",
    "the analysis of the pds data alone can not provide a precise estimate of the non - thermal spectral index .",
    "a tighter constraint can be obtained by including in our analysis the hpgspc data in the 4.5 - 20 kev energy range , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the hpgspc instrument has a field of view ( @xmath27 ) , comparable to that of the pds ( @xmath7 , hexagonal ) , and can therefore be used for a global spectral fit . combining hpgspc and pds data",
    "it is then possible to leave the temperature of the intracluster medium as a free parameter in the fit procedure .",
    "the relative normalization of the two instruments has been left free , to account for the slightly different field of views and the remaining uncertainties in the intercalibration .",
    "we obtain an icm temperature of 8.5@xmath28kev , consistent with the determination , and an iron abundance of @xmath29 .",
    "the reduced @xmath22 is 0.80 for 34 degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting allowed spectral index range is 0.7 - 2.5 , smaller than the previous one determined using only the pds data , but still not sufficient to distinguish between different emission mechanisms . if we fix the parameters of the thermal component to their best - fit values we obtain @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for the photon index of the non - thermal radiation , corresponding to a contribution of the non - thermal emission to the 2 - 10 kev flux between @xmath32 .",
    "the pds onboard the satellite detected hard x - ray emission up to energies of @xmath080 kev in the spectrum of the coma cluster , with a clear excess above the thermal intracluster emission , which is best explained as a non - thermal component .    one possible explanation for the observed excess is emission by a different source in the field of view .",
    "the most qualified candidate is the seyfert 1 galaxy x comae at z=0.092@xmath110.002 ( bond & sargent 1973 ) .",
    "the pspc observation ( dow & white 1995 ) reports a power law spectrum with photon index 2.50@xmath110.16 and a flux of 3.6@xmath33 in the 0.4 - 2.4 kev band ( corresponding to @xmath34 in the range 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "x comae has been observed also by ( branduardi - raymont 1985 ) and by ipc slew survey ( elvis 1992 ) at approximately the same flux level .",
    "the steep photon index reported by requires an unusual variability of a factor @xmath065 to explain the detected hard excess , considering that the source is @xmath35 off - axis and @xmath36 . with a more typical photon index of 1.8",
    "the variability factor is @xmath011 , no longer extreme but still large .",
    "luckily enough , x comae is located just on the edge of the field of view of the mecs , and part of the point spread function ( psf ) of the source lies within the field of view of the detector . considering the location of x comae and the lack of detection",
    ", it is possible to estimate an upper limit to the flux of the source of the order of @xmath37(2 - 10 kev ) , much lower than the flux of @xmath38(photon index = 1.8 ) required to account for the hxr .    if , instead , we assume that the hard spectral tail detected at energies above 25 kev is due to relativistic electrons scattering the cmb photons , it is possible to derive , using only observables , the value of the mean volume - averaged intracluster magnetic field , b. in the coma cluster , the radio halo coma c has an extension of @xmath01 mpc in radius and is located in the central region of the cluster .",
    "relating the observed synchrotron radio flux to the x - ray ic flux we obtain : @xmath39      the value of the radio halo spectral index is still uncertain for coma c. considering all the radio fluxes measured between 30.9 mhz and 1.4 ghz , kim ( 1990 ) and giovannini ( 1993 ) determined a value of @xmath44 , while @xmath45 is obtained using the flux measured at 1.4 ghz by deiss ( 1997 ) .",
    "we have re - modeled the radio flux spectrum of coma c between 30.9 mhz and 2.7 ghz using the data set given in giovannini ( 1993 ) , taking into account the electron energy losses due to synchrotron and ic emission ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the best - fit indicates an electron injection spectrum of 2.92@xmath110.20 ( @xmath46 , @xmath31 ) , while curvature of the radio spectrum is detected at @xmath47 100 mhz due to electron ageing . considering that the electron energy range should be 2.4 - 4.9 gev in order to give ic emission in the 20 - 80 kev band , and that the radio spectrum begins to steepen at @xmath47 100 mhz , @xmath40 is 0.96 for values of b@xmath48 .",
    "the radio data and the x - ray spectrum detected by the pds then imply a value of b@xmath49 , while b@xmath50 is obtained if the extreme value of 1.34 is adopted for @xmath40 . using the size , r , and the distance , d , of the radio source it is possible to estimate the electron energy density . assuming a radio halo size r=1 mpc ( @xmath51 ) and a distance d=138 mpc , the energy density of electrons with energies @xmath52 500 mev is @xmath53 .",
    "the estimated value of b is not very different from the lower limit of 0.1 @xmath54 derived from the 2@xmath1 upper bounds on the hxr reported by the osse experiment ( rephaeli , ulmer & gruber 1994 ) .",
    "binning the pds data between @xmath040 kev and @xmath080 kev , the hxr flux ( @xmath55 ) is lower by a factor @xmath02 with respect to the upper limit ( see fig .",
    "the non - thermal contribution to the 2 - 10 kev flux is @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath40= 0.96 , 1.16 and 1.34 , respectively .",
    "this contribution has implications for the determination of the intracluster gas properties .",
    "the value of the magnetic field derived here seems to be inconsistent with the measurements of faraday rotation of polarized radiation through the hot icm that give a line - of - sight value of b in the range @xmath58 ( kim 1990 ; feretti 1995 ) .",
    "we note , however , that feretti ( 1995 ) inferred also the existence of a weaker magnetic field component , ordered on a scale of about a cluster core radius , with a line - of - sight strength in the range @xmath59 . from the results obtained here with the ic model",
    ", we can argue that the strongly tangled magnetic field component of 6 @xmath54 is likely present in local cluster regions , while the overall cluster magnetic field may be more reasonably represented by the weaker and ordered component , whose strength is in good agreement with the present estimate . other determinations ( or lower limits ) of b based on different methods",
    "are in the range 0.2 - 0.4@xmath54 ( hwang 1997 ; bowyer & berghfer 1998 ; sreekumar 1996 ; henriksen 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the equipartition magnetic field is @xmath60 ( giovannini 1993 ) .",
    "very attractive suggestions have been proposed regarding the origin of the ic magnetic field , such as that in which galaxy motion may drive a turbulent dynamo which amplifies faint seed fields to an average value of @xmath61 .",
    "the seed fields are supplied through gas loss by galaxies ( goldman & rephaeli 1991 ; de young 1992 ) .",
    "larger magnetic fields require different amplification mechanisms , such as merger activity .",
    "different interpretations have also been proposed to explain the non - thermal hard x  ray emission .",
    "ensslin , lieu & biermann ( 1998 ) suggest that it might be bremsstrahlung emission by suprathermal electrons in the icm , accelerated by turbulences within the medium .",
    "another proposed emission mechanism is given by ic scattering of a large population of cosmic rays by the cmb photons ( lieu 1998b ) .",
    "in this model the relativistic component could be also responsible for the soft excess discovered in a few clusters in the 69 ev - 0.4 kev energy band ( lieu 1996a , b ; bower , lampton & lieu 1996 ; fabian 1996 ; mittaz , lieu & lockman 1998 ; bowyer , lieu & mittaz 1998 ; kaastra 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the re - modeled euv and soft x - ray data by lieu ( 1998a ) lead to a photon index of @xmath01.75 .",
    "an extrapolation of the euv spectra to higher energies gives an excess flux between 20 - 80 kev of @xmath62 , only a factor @xmath02 lower than the pds excess , suggesting a possible physical connection between the soft and hard excesses .",
    "the next step in studying the hard x  ray emission would be a precise estimate of its spectral shape , which would help in discriminating between competing emission mechanisms",
    ". a longer observation of the coma cluster would be valuable in this respect .",
    "sarazin & lieu ( 1988 ) suggest that a relic population of very low energy cosmic ray electrons may be responsible for the ic euv excess detected also in clusters of galaxies in which radio haloes are absent .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate radio quiet clusters of galaxies to verify whether hard x - ray excesses are common in galaxy clusters ."
