    "while the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has great potential in searching for strongly interacting particles , its reach in the electroweak sector of new physics scenarios is limited due to the suppressed electroweak production cross sections .",
    "although those electroweak particles could appear in the cascade decay of heavier colored objects , the discovery reach depends strongly on the mass scale of the colored ones .",
    "current lhc searches in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are mostly focused on the direct pair production of squarks and gluinos .",
    "null search results from both atlas and cms @xcite already exclude the mass of those colored particles up to about 800 gev .",
    "it is likely that those colored particles are so heavy that they are out of the reach of the lhc . in this paper",
    ", we consider the direct production of the electroweak sector of the mssm .",
    "in particular , we focus on the lhc reach for the discovery of the sleptons . a complementary study on the lhc",
    "reach in the neutralino and chargino sector with decoupled sleptons can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if low energy supersymmetry is realized in the nature , sleptons are likely to be light .",
    "this happens in the gauge mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scenarios @xcite , as well as the anomaly mediated susy breaking scenarios @xcite , in which the slepton masses are proportional to the electroweak gauge couplings . even in the minimal gravity",
    "mediated susy breaking scenarios ( msugra ) @xcite where all the scalars have a common mass @xmath9 at some high energy scale , renormalization group running to low energies typically pushes up the squark mass ( due to the contributions of strongly interacting gluinos ) while the sleptons remain light . while the masses of the superpartners of the colored objects have already been constrained by current search limits , it is timely to fully explore the discovery potential of the lhc for the superpartners of leptons .    in the @xmath10-parity conserving mssm with the lightest neutralino @xmath11 being the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , @xmath11 is a good candidate for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter @xcite . when sleptons are light , the @xmath12-channel diagram mediated by the exchange of sleptons is important in determining the annihilation cross section of @xmath11 dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , discovery of the sleptons is not only a verification of low energy supersymmetry in nature ; precise measurement of their masses also plays an important role in determining the relic density of the neutralino lsp .",
    "earlier studies on the slepton discovery potential at the lhc mostly focused on the drell - yan pair production of slepton pairs , with sleptons directly decaying down to lepton and @xmath11 @xcite . most of those studies are done either in the msugra framework or for a certain set of benchmark points only",
    ". the drell - yan production cross sections for slepton pairs are typically small , suppressed both by the electroweak coupling strength , as well as the scalar nature of the sleptons .",
    "the lhc reach is very limited : @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 gev for the lhc with center of mass 14 tev and 30 @xmath7 integrated luminosity @xcite .    in our study , we focused on an alternative production mechanism for the sleptons via the on - shell decay of heavier neutralino and chargino states @xcite .",
    "in particular , we considered the scenario where @xmath15 and studied the pair production of wino - like @xmath16 with the subsequent decay of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the collider signature is trilepton plus missing @xmath4 .",
    "compared to the traditional searches of slepton drell - yan pair production with dilepton plus missing @xmath4 signature , this channel is advantageous for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the production cross section for @xmath16 , although also at the electroweak strength , is larger than slepton pair production due to the fermionic nature of the neutralinos and charginos .",
    "secondly , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 being dominantly wino , the decay branching fraction into left - handed sleptons is almost 100% .",
    "thirdly , the sm backgrounds for this trilepton signature are also much smaller , with dominant contributions from the leptonic decay of @xmath21 , as well as @xmath22 with an extra lepton from heavy flavor decay .",
    "in addition , the invariant mass of the dileptons from the @xmath19 cascade decay chain , @xmath3 , has a distinctive triangle shape , with a sharp kinematic cutoff , @xmath23 completely determined by @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this triangle feature has been mostly used as a precise determination of the slepton mass @xcite .",
    "it is also used in the recent cms opposite sign dilepton searches to enhance the signal acceptance @xcite .",
    "although this spectral shape can be obvious to the eye , it could easily get washed out when sm backgrounds are considered . in our study , we explore the lhc discovery potential for sleptons by performing a fit to this triangle spectral shape .",
    "we also fit the dilepton invariant mass distribution from the dominant sm backgrounds ( either containing a @xmath27 or from @xmath22 ) .",
    "since we keep the overall normalization of the backgrounds that contain a @xmath28 as a fitting parameter , our treatment allows us to include other backgrounds that contain a @xmath28 as well , for example , those from other susy processes .",
    "we obtain the effective cross section , @xmath29 br @xmath30 acceptance , necessary for a 5@xmath6 discovery as a function of the cutoff mass .",
    "this result is model independent and can be applied to any new physics model that gives rise to the same decay topology and signature . when applied to the mssm slepton produced in the cascade decay of wino - like @xmath31",

    "we consider the low lying spectrum of the mssm electroweak sector , which includes only neutralinos , charginos , and light sleptons . in our discussion below , we assume the canonical case where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath32 and @xmath39 being the mass parameters for bino , winos and higgsinos , respectively ) and the lightest neutralino lsp is dominantly bino - type .",
    "scenarios with other mass orderings can be studied similarly .",
    "the slepton mass spectrum is determined by @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where each @xmath43 is a @xmath44 matrix , representing three generations . in our study , we take the simple assumption that the flavor mixing between generations is negligible .",
    "the phenomenology and implication of sizable flavor mixing in the slepton sector can be found in ref .",
    "furthermore , the left - right mixing in the slepton sector is typically proportional to the lepton yukawa , which is small for the first two generations .",
    "therefore , we assume there is no left - right mixing for selectrons and smuons and label the mass eigenstates as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , with masses @xmath33 and @xmath48 , respectively . for the stau , left - right mixing could be sizable , especially with large @xmath49 .",

    "the coupling of higgsinos to sleptons are highly suppressed by the small lepton yukawa coupling , therefore the production of sleptons from higgsino decay is negligible .",

    "it should also be noted that such slepton production via cascade decay of heavier neutralinos and charginos only works effectively for the left - handed charged sleptons . for the right handed sleptons ,",
    "even if it is lighter than @xmath32 , the branching fraction is small in general compared to the dominant decays of @xmath95 , @xmath96 since it is suppressed by the small wino - bino mixing .",
    "it only becomes important in the limited parameter regions with small @xmath97 such that the on - shell decay of @xmath19 into the dominant channels are forbidden .",

    "one distinctive feature of the dileptons from the on - shell cascade decay of @xmath19 ( see the right plot of fig .  [",

    ", it should be noted that our study works most effectively for the left - handed slepton , since the decay fraction of heavier neutralino / chargino states to right - handed sleptons is typically suppressed in most of parameter space , either by the small bino - wino / higgsino mixing , or the lepton yukawa couplings .",

    "the corresponding branching fraction into trilepton final states needs to be taken into account in such general cases .",
    "trilepton final states with all possible flavor combinations could also be studied , although the fitting to the triangle shapes might be more complicated when the slepton masses are not degenerate .    in our study",

    "the fitting strategy could be applied to final states containing two opposite sign same flavor dileptons .",
    "for example , charginos in @xmath0 production could decay to jets instead of leptons ; or we could consider productions originated from gluinos or squarks , with the cascade decay of gluino or quark containing a @xmath19 .",
    "sm backgrounds for dilepton plus jets plus missing @xmath4 signature , of course , are very different from the trilepton plus missing @xmath4 signal that we considered in our study .",
    "we could also consider wino type @xmath200 production with @xmath201 .",
    "the final state of dilepton plus missing @xmath4 is similar to the conventional slepton study of drell - yan pair production of @xmath202 with @xmath203 .",
    "although this channel is not as powerful as the trilepton plus missing @xmath4 study that we explored in this paper , it would still have better reach comparing to the drell - yan process given the larger production cross sections .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , our analyses can not be applied to the cases when the sleptons are heavier than @xmath32 , when the drell - yan is the dominant production mode .",
    "previous lhc analyses on the drell - yan channel focused on the dilepton plus missing @xmath4 final states . when left - handed sleptons are heavier than wino - like neutralino / charginos , the branching fractions of heavier sleptons into wino - like states are sizable given its @xmath204 coupling strength . considering the consequent decay of the wino - like neutralino / charginos , multiple leptons ( up to six ) + jets @xmath205 final states could appear , which provides additional channels for the left - handed slepton discovery at the lhc .",
    "for the right - handed sleptons , however , decays into lepton plus bino - like @xmath11 lsp are still dominant .",
    "light sleptons could also contribute sizably to low energy processes , for example , parity - violating electron scattering , leptonic pion and kaon decays , etc . @xcite .",
    "given the recent progress on both the theoretical and experimental studies in those low energy precision measurements , they have reached a sensitivity which is now able to probe new physics beyond the sm .",
