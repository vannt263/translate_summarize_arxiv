    "assets volatility plays an essential role in modern finance .",
    "it provides a measure of variability for the asset price over a certain period of time , and is a key parameter in many financial applications such as financial derivatives pricing , risk assessment , and portfolio management . because volatility is not observable , statistical modeling that produces accurate volatility estimation and prediction is of great assistance .",
    "the squared return of log prices , being the classical estimator of variance , used to be the `` ideal '' proxy of volatility . as a result ,",
    "many volatility models built on returns were proposed and , for a long time , had been very popular and successful .",
    "the celebrated arch ( engle 1982 ) and garch ( bollerslev 1986 ) models are examples of this type .",
    "recently , as the high - frequency transaction data become available , price changes can be practically monitored in a continuous way , and the traditional low - frequency ( e.g. , daily ) return is no longer quite representative of the volatility .",
    "for example , a small return does not necessarily imply low volatility , as the price may fluctuate a lot and close at a similar level to the opening . on the other hand",
    ", a big return could only be the result of a very different opening price from the previous day s closing .",
    "therefore , the return - based models , using too little information , are likely to produce inefficient or even incorrect estimates of the volatility .    in fact ,",
    "since closing price is only a `` snapshot '' among numerous prices during a day , there is nothing special about it and return needs not to be calculated solely from it . with the availability of high - frequency data , intuitively , the log difference between any two observed prices in two consecutive days can be called a `` return '' .",
    "this idea leads to a naturally generalized concept of daily return , which is an interval that includes all the `` snapshot '' returns .",
    "let @xmath0 be the log price of an asset at time @xmath1 on day @xmath2 . ideally @xmath1 should be a continuous time index .",
    "but since price can only be observed at discrete times even for high - frequency data , @xmath1 is assumed to be a discrete index here .",
    "we define the interval - valued daily return as @xmath3\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\left[\\min_{s}\\left\\{y_t\\left(s\\right)\\right\\}-\\max_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\ } , \\max_{s}\\left\\{y_t\\left(s\\right)\\right\\}-\\min_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\}\\right].\\label{def : rt-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] namely , @xmath4 is the range of `` snapshot '' returns during one day , which , apparently , contains more information about the daily volatility than the traditional closing - to - closing return .",
    "our goal is to build a volatility model that reveals the dynamics of @xmath4 as an interval .    throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we will view @xmath4 as a random interval and model its dynamics under the framework of random sets . to facilitate our presentation",
    ", we now briefly introduce the basic notations and definitions in the random set theory .",
    "( see , e.g. , kendall 1974 , matheron 1975 , artstein and vitale 1975 , molchanov 2005 , sun and ralescu 2014 . )",
    "let @xmath5 be a probability space .",
    "denote by @xmath6 or @xmath7 the collection of all non - empty compact subsets of @xmath8 . in the space @xmath7 , a linear structure is defined by minkowski addition and scalar multiplication , i.e. , @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a natural metric for the linear space @xmath7 is the hausdorff metric @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the euclidean metric .",
    "a random compact set is a borel measurable function @xmath15 , @xmath7 being equipped with the borel @xmath16-algebra induced by the hausdorff metric . for each @xmath17 ,",
    "the function defined on the unit sphere @xmath18 : @xmath19 is called the support function of a. if @xmath20 is convex almost surely , then @xmath21 is called a random compact convex set .",
    "much of the random sets theory has focused on compact convex sets via their support functions .",
    "especially , a one - dimensional random compact convex set is called a random interval .    under the linear structure ( [ set - lin ] ) , the random interval @xmath4 can be alternatively defined as @xmath22-\\left[\\min_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\ } , \\max_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\}\\right].\\ ] ] namely , @xmath4 can be viewed as the return of daily price ranges .",
    "an immediate observation from equation ( [ def : rt-2 ] ) is @xmath23\\right|+\\left|\\left[\\min_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\ } , \\max_{w}\\left\\{y_{t-1}\\left(w\\right)\\right\\}\\right]\\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the lebesgue measure or the length of an interval . that is , the length of @xmath4 is the sum of the high - low log price ranges of the two corresponding days .",
    "feller ( 1951 ) derived the asymptotic distribution of the range of a wiener process .",
    "this , together with the classical stochastic volatility models , provides the theoretical evidence that the log price range contains rich information of the integrated variance , and consequently the daily volatility too .",
    "it in turn explains from another perspective that @xmath4 is an invaluable resource for estimating the daily volatiity .",
    "there has been a great deal of effort in the literature on volatility modeling using the high - low ( log ) price range of either low - frequency or high - frequency data ( garman and klass 1980 , parkinson 1980 , rogers and satchell 1991 , kunitomo 1992 , alizadel et al .",
    "2002 , chou 2005 , engle and gallo 2006 , brandt and jones 2006 , christensen and podolskij 2007 ) .",
    "one common characteristic of the existing methods is that they consider the high - low price range as an indicator of the volatility and include it explicitly into the modeling by functions of certain forms . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we focus on the interval - valued [ low , high ] return range as opposed to the point - valued high - low price range .",
    "it is seen from the above discussion that the information from the high - low price range is already contained in the return range . in addition , the return range also includes the return itself somewhere in the interval .",
    "therefore , careful modeling of the [ low , high ] return range as a whole is expected to produce promising estimate of the volatility that accounts for information from both the return and the price range . to this end",
    ", we propose to model the return range process @xmath25 by developing a generalized interval - valued garch ( int - garch ) model . under this new framework",
    ", the classical point - valued garch process becomes the degenerate case of our int - garch model , where the return range @xmath4 has zero length .",
    "our theoretical results are two - fold .",
    "we first show that under certain conditions our int - garch model achieves a weak stationarity that is characterized by a time invariant mean and variance .",
    "then , under the assumption of weak stationarity , we define and give the explicit formula of the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the int - garch process .",
    "we propose a conditional least squares ( cls ) method to estimate the model parameters , which is implemented by a newton - raphson algorithm .",
    "simulation results are consistent with our theoretical findings and our cls estimates are very satisfactory .    for empirical study",
    ", we analyze the dow jones component stocks data using our proposed int - garch model .",
    "it is hard to judge how well it estimates the volatility , but we manage to demonstrate the characteristics and advantages of our int - garch via comparisons to both garch and realized volatility ( rv ) .",
    "it is shown that int - garch model , by implicitly utilizing the intraday data ( i.e. , daily price range ) , has the advantage of rv to reflect the intraday price variability , which the return - based models such as garch are usually insufficient for . the idea to embed high - frequency volatility measures such as rv ( andersen et al . 2001 , barndorff - nielsen and shephard 2002 ) and realized kernel ( barndorff - nielsen et al .",
    "2008 ) into low - frequency models is not new .",
    "for example , the garchx ( engle 2002 ) , heavy ( shephard and sheppard 2010 ) , and realgarch ( hansen et al .",
    "2012 ) models are all important contributions along this direction .",
    "as certainly these compound models improve over the daily models with intraday information , their strong dependence on the realized measures makes them sensitive to any uncertainty or bias in these measures .",
    "for instance , it is well known that rv suffers from microstructure noises ( see , e.g. , hansen and lunde 2006 , brandi and russell 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "so , in order for such a compound model with rv to achieve its optimal performance , caution needs to be taken , either to choose the right sampling frequency or the appropriate remedy such as pre - averaging ( jacod et al . 2009 ) and subsampling ( zhang et al .",
    "2004 ) , to ensure that rv well measures the intraday volatility .",
    "based on this discussion and the results of our empirical analysis , we believe that our int - garch model makes the contribution of systematically integrating the low and high frequency volatility measures in an effective and operationally simple way , without obvious vulnerability to the microstructure noises .",
    "we present in our study that it is especially useful when assets are frequently traded and the intraday variation is significant .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we formally introduce our int - garch model in section 2 .",
    "main theoretical results are presented in section 3 and section 4 .",
    "section 5 proposes the conditional least squares method for estimating model parameters and carefully investigates its performances by a simulation study .",
    "empirical study with the dow jones stocks data , as well as a detailed discussion , are reported in section 6 .",
    "we finish with concluding remarks in section 7 .",
    "proofs and useful lemmas are deferred to the appendix .",
    "we assume observing an interval - valued time series @xmath26 of the form @xmath27,\\ t=1,2,\\cdots , t.\\ ] ] that is , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the associated center and radius processes , both of which are observable .",
    "a practical example of @xmath26 we consider in this paper is the daily return range process .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the information set up to time t , i.e. @xmath31 we are concerned with the conditional variance of @xmath4 given @xmath32 .",
    "+ the garch model depicts the conditional variance of a point - valued return process as a linear function of the past returns and variances .",
    "this was inspired by the fact that assets returns usually exhibit volatility clustering : large variations in prices tend to cluster together , resulting in separate dynamic and tranquil periods of the market . extending this spirit to the interval - valued process @xmath25",
    ", one would expect , conceptually , a model such like @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the conditional variance of @xmath4 given @xmath32 , and @xmath35 is linear in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we point out that @xmath37 in ( [ model ] ) is only a notation , representing an estimate of the past variance .",
    "actually , the square of a set has not been formally defined in the literature yet .",
    "to realize such a model , we need to have a mathematical definition for the conditional variance of a random interval @xmath4 and explicitly express it in terms of the observable random variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the variance of a compact convex random set was originally introduced by lyashenko ( 1982 ) and further studied in krner ( 1995 ) .",
    "applying these results to the random interval @xmath4 , via straightforward calculations , we obtain @xmath40,\\label{meana}\\\\    \\text{var}(r_t)&=&\\text{var}(\\lambda_t)+\\text{var}(\\delta_t)\\label{vara}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interpretation of ( [ vara ] ) is obvious : the variance of a random interval consists of the variances from both the center and the radius . considering ( [ vara ] ) and assuming @xmath41 , a reasonable function @xmath35 in ( [ model ] ) seems to imply @xmath42    + \\sum_{i=1}^{q}\\beta_ih_{t - i}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 . since the unconditional mean of @xmath39 is a constant and therefore can be absorbed into the parameter @xmath44 , the above equation is simplified to @xmath45+\\sum_{i=1}^{q}\\beta_ih_{t - i}^2.\\ ] ] to give more flexibility to our model , we allow for different degrees of dependence of @xmath46 on the past centers and radii .",
    "in addition , we propose to model volatility @xmath46 directly , instead of via the conditional variance @xmath34 .",
    "given the above discussion , we propose the following int - garch @xmath47 model for the return range process : @xmath48,\\label{igarch_2}\\\\    \\epsilon_t&\\sim&n(0,1),\\label{igarch_3}\\\\    \\eta_t&\\sim&\\gamma(k,1),\\label{igarch_4}\\\\    h_t&=&\\mu+\\sum_{i=1}^{p}\\alpha_i|\\lambda_{t - i}|+\\sum_{i=1}^{q}\\beta_i\\delta_{t - i}+\\sum_{i=1}^{w}\\gamma_ih_{t - i},\\label{igarch_5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are positive constants . in ( [ igarch_1 ] ) , `` @xmath51 '' denotes the scalar multiplication . although we pose parametric assumptions on the error terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 to simplify our presentation here , they are not really necessary . in practice , it is best to use the true data generating distributions , which vary from data to data .",
    "so , in replacement of ( [ igarch_3])-([igarch_4 ] ) , a relaxed yet sufficient specification for @xmath52 and @xmath53 is @xmath54 we can get some insights into this interval - valued model by breaking it down into point - valued models .",
    "for example , let @xmath55 denote the high - low log price range on day @xmath2 .",
    "then , in view of ( [ rt - prc - range ] ) , it is easily derived from the int - garch model that @xmath56 or equivalently , @xmath57 separately , denoting by @xmath58 the close - to - close return on day @xmath2 , we have @xmath59 for some @xmath60 $ ] . the reduced model ( [ range - model])-([return - model ] ) implies @xmath61 the return @xmath58 can be anywhere in the return range @xmath4 , so the exact value of @xmath62 in the above equations is not known .",
    "but it should not be important anyway , as a single close - to - close return is not necessarily informative about the volatility .",
    "the idea of int - garch is to combine all these factors and calculate the conditional variance of the whole interval @xmath4 as @xmath63 where @xmath46 is used as the estimated volatility .",
    "finally , we notice that when @xmath64 , the radius @xmath65 , and the model ( [ igarch_1])-([igarch_5 ] ) reduces to the usual point - valued garch model , except that the linear dependence on the past is specified for the conditional standard deviation .",
    "similar to the garch model , the int - garch(1,1,1 ) process is the simplest but most often an effective model for analyzing interval - valued time series with conditional heteroskedasticity . in this section , we derive several important distribution properties of int - garch ( 1,1,1 ) . before we present our theoretical results , we first notice that for the int - garch ( 1,1,1 ) process , @xmath66 therefore , defining the i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 can be re - written as @xmath70 we will use ( [ def_x ] ) throughout this section to simplify notations .      it is derived in krner ( 1995 ) that the covariance between two random intervals is the sum of the covariances between the two centers and two radii .",
    "this implies @xmath71 we are ready to extend the notion of weak stationarity to interval - valued time series in the obvious way .",
    "an interval - valued time series @xmath25 is said to be weakly stationary , or second - moment stationary , if its unconditional mean @xmath72 and covariance @xmath73 exist and are independent of time @xmath2 for all integers @xmath1 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given in ( [ meana ] ) and ( [ covab ] ) , respectively .",
    "the existences of @xmath72 and @xmath74 are closely related to the those of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath77 implies the existences of the first two moments of @xmath4 .",
    "we give precise conditions in the following two theorems .",
    "[ thm : mean ] consider the int - garch model ( [ igarch_1])-([igarch_5 ] ) with @xmath78 .",
    "assume @xmath25 starts from its infinite past with a finite mean .",

    "so far we have found equivalent conditions for the existence of a time - invariant ( unconditional ) mean and variance . in order to guarantee weak stationarity , by definition ,",
    "we still need to find conditions under which the ( unconditional ) covariances are finite and time - invariant . according to the following theorem [ thm : cov ] , these conditions turn out to be the same as those for the existence of variance .",
    "this is not surprising as @xmath92 and , for a time series model with specified recursive structure , the existence of any unconditional moment usually implies time - invariance too .",
    "we summarize this conclusion in corollary [ cor : stat ] following theorem [ thm : cov ] .",
    "[ thm : cov ] consider the int - garch(1,1,1 ) process @xmath25 . under the assumptions of theorem [ thm : var ] ,",

    "we see that the centers are uncorrelated .",
    "this has been verified by ( [ eqn2 ] ) in the proof of theorem [ thm : cov ] .",
    "( we will elaborate more on this in the subsequent section . )",
    "the radii , or the lengths of the intervals , have a relatively persistent auto - correlation , which coincides with the phenomenon of `` volatility clustering '' .",
    "this long - term dependence of radii carries over to the intervals as a whole , and results in a slow - dying acf of the interval - valued process .",
