    "the metallicity of the cluster is rather controversial .",
    "malkan ( 1981 ) obtained a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath41.30 for palomar  6 using the @xmath13 index , ranking it an intermediate metallicity inner halo cluster .",
    "zinn ( 1985 ) derived [ fe / h ] = @xmath40.74 for palomar  6 by reanalyzing malkan s photometry .",
    "ortolani et al .  (",
    "1995 ) estimated [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath40.4 based on the @xmath19 cmd .",
    "minniti ( 1995 ) studied the metallicities of seven reddened clusters including palomar  6 .",
    "he obtained spectra of six red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars in palomar  6 with a 2   resolution covering @xmath21 4700  5400  .",
    "he suggested that the sum of mg @xmath22 5175  , fe @xmath22 5270  , and fe @xmath22 5535   lines ( mg + 2fe ) is the most sensitive to metallicity following faber et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and he derived [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 @xmath18 0.3 for palomar  6 based on the location of the giants in the mg + 2fe _ vs _ @xmath23 diagram .",
    "more recently , bica et al .  ( 1998 ) obtained [ @xmath24 = @xmath40.09 by measuring ca  ii triplet @xmath21 8498 , 8542 , and 8662   using the intermediate resolution integrated spectra .",
    "as discussed above , palomar  6 suffers a large interstellar reddening .",
    "the interstellar extinction in the visual passband @xmath25 for palomar  6 is expected to be @xmath1 3.9  4.3 mag , depending on its true interstellar reddening value , and the apparent visual magnitude of the horizontal branch ( hb ) @xmath26 is @xmath1 20 mag ( ortolani et al .",
    "thus , photometric study of palomar  6 in the visual passband is very difficult .",
    "it is also likely that differential reddening , which is commonly detected in heavily reddened clusters , is present .",
    "the ir photometry is , therefore , essential for studying palomar  6 , since it is less sensitive to the interstellar reddening and the differential reddening effect . in this paper",
    ", we explore the ground - based @xmath0 photometry of palomar  6 .",
    "a comparison with @xmath27 photometry of minniti , olszewski , rieke ( 1995 ) is made .",
    "the distance modulus using the @xmath28 magnitude of the red horizontal branch ( rhb ) and the metallicity estimate using the rgb slope of the cluster are discussed .",
    "our observations were carried out using the 4 m telescope at kpno on the night of june 15 1997 under photometric conditions .",
    "the detector was a 256@xmath29256 hgcdte nicmos3 array and the jhk filter system was employed .",
    "the image scale was 0.60 arcsec pixel@xmath20 providing a field of view ( fov ) of 2.56 @xmath29 2.56 arcmin .",
    "the journal of observations is presented in table  1 .    during our observations , we dithered the telescope pointing to minimize the effects induced by bad pixels and cosmic ray events . for standard star frames ,",
    "the telescope pointing was dithered with an offset of 37 arcsec between successive exposures .",
    "offsets of 6 and 10 arcsec were applied for palomar  6 object frames .",
    "nicmos3 detectors utilize a hybrid architecture in which each pixel has an associated unit cell which controls the biasing and readout of the pixel .",
    "thus , each pixel is essentially independent of the others and charge bleeding or trailing from saturated pixels is not present .",
    "however , this independence also means that such properties as linearity and dark current can vary from pixel to pixel , and it is necessary to calibrate these effects for optimum scientific performance .",
    "the mean dark current of nicmos3 is known to be @xmath1 2 @xmath30/sec .",
    "however it does not scale simply with the exposure time .",
    "thus we obtained dark frames with the same exposure times as object and standard star frames to calibrate the dark currents .",
    "the non - linearity of the detector sensitivity was also calibrated .",
    "we obtained a series of dome flats with exposure times of 3 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 sec maintaining the same illumination intensity .",
    "we also obtained 1 sec exposures before and after each exposure to monitor possible changes in the illumination .",
    "then the fluxes of each exposure were normalized to that of 1 sec exposures .",
    "the measured fluxes for each exposure were plotted as a function of expected fluxes with linear sensitivity .",
    "then we derived a third - order relation , @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corrected flux and the observed flux in adu , respectively .",
    "this relation was then applied to each object frame using the iraf task irlincor .",
    "figure  1 shows the non - linear response curve of nicmos3 detector .",
    "the solid line represents the linear relation and filled circles represent the observed fluxes and open circles represent the corrected fluxes using the relation above .",
    "the sky - flats were generated by median - combining object frames of the individual dithering sequences for each passband .",
    "this procedure essentially removes the stellar light and cosmic ray , and provides good sky - flats for less crowded fields , such as standard star frames .",
    "the sky - flats generated using palomar  6 object frames , however , show residuals of stellar images , indicating that this procedure fails when the field is too crowded . applying",
    "sky - flats generated from the other images taken at different times may cause potential problems .",
    "it is known that there are two predominant sources of infrared sky background , which are essentially independent , both physically and spectrally . at short wavelengths ( in particular @xmath34 passband ) , the sky is dominated by emission lines from oh in the upper atmosphere ( typically 90 km altitude ) .",
    "the strength of these lines can vary over the course of a night ; in addition , upper level winds create inhomogeneity and motion of the airglow . as a result",
    ", the intensity of the background can vary unpredictably during the night . at longer wavelengths , thermal emission from the telescope optics and optically thick telluric lines predominates .",
    "the transition between these two regimes occurs at approximately 2.3 microns , so the background with filters other than @xmath35 or @xmath28 is primarily oh airglow .",
    "we produced master sky - flats , which were median - combined sky - flats of the whole set of standard star frames , rather than using sky - flats from a single dithering sequence .",
    "since the standard star frames were taken over the night in our observation , using these master sky - flats will minimize the risk of the abrupt changes of infrared sky background .",
    "figure  2 shows a comparison between the sky - flat generated using the palomar  6 frame ( upper left ) and our master sky - flat ( upper right ) in the @xmath36 passband . as can be seen , the sky - flat using the palomar  6 frames shows residuals of stellar light .",
    "this causes serious problems in the central part of the cluster , where the field is more crowded .",
    "the flat - field corrected images are also shown in the figure .",
    "the lower left panel shows the final image using the sky - flat from the palomar  6 frames and the lower right panel shows that of using the master sky - flat .",
    "the former does not resolve fainter stars very well and even brighter stars were turned out to be affected by the residual flux on the sky flat in the central part of the cluster . therefore , we used the master sky - flat in our analysis .",
    "it is known that there are several hundred bad pixels in the nicmos3 detector used in our observation .",
    "the bad pixel correction was applied after the flat - field correction step .",
    "the bad pixel mask was generated using the standard star frames .",
    "the flat - field corrected standard star frames ( @xmath1 100 frames ) were normalized and then median combined . since the strict definition of a bad pixel is rather subjective except for the non - responsive ( dead ) pixels , the pixels deviating more than 7 @xmath37 around the mean value (= 1.0 ) were defined to be bad pixels .",
    "the pixel values at the bad pixel position were interpolated using those of nearby pixels .",
    "finally , the object frames in each dithering sequence were combined .",
    "our combined image of palomar  6 in @xmath28 passband is shown in figure  3 .    during the night , we observed the six ukirt faint standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the number of ir standard stars is small and the most of the ir standard stars by elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) are too bright for our camera plus telescope configuration .",
    "all standard frames were analyzed using the photometry task in daophotii ( stetson 1995 ) . with the results of aperture photometry , growth curve analysis was performed using daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) to obtain integrated magnitudes .",
    "the extinction coefficients were derived from one standard star ( fs25 ) .",
    "the first - order @xmath28 passband extinction term @xmath38 is 0.101 mag airmass@xmath20 and the first - order color extinction terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath40.004 and 0.045 mag airmass@xmath20 , respectively .    to calibrate the photometry , the photometric transformations were assumed to have the following form , @xmath41 the transformation coefficients are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 in the ukirt @xmath0 system .",

    "( the errors are those of the mean . )",
    "point - spread function ( psf ) photometry for all palomar  6 frames was performed using daophotii and allstar / allframe ( stetson 1987 , 1994 , 1995 ; turner 1995 ) .",
    "the first step was to perform the aperture photometry with star lists returned from the find routine .",
    "we calculated psfs using isolated bright stars . to obtain good psfs on each frame ,",
    "at least 3 iterations of neighboring - star removal were performed . for the psf calculations",
    ", we adopted a spatially invariable psf since , unlike modern ccds , a nicmos3 array has a small fov , so that the stellar radial profiles are not expected to show large variations over the frame .",
    "also , the number of psf stars is too small ( usually 20 - 30 stars ) to calculate reliable variable psfs in each frame . in case of 2k ccd system ,",
    "the number of psf stars are large enough ( for example 90 - 110 stars in lee & carney 1999 ) to calculate a variable psf in each frame .",
    "after the first allframe pass , we undertook an additional pass to find more stars on the subtracted frames .",
    "since we used a small psf radius ( usually , @xmath50fwhm ) to compute the psf magnitude due to crowding , a psf magnitude must be converted into an aperture magnitude with a larger radius , a process known as _ aperture correction_. the 20 to 30 psf stars on each frame were used for this purpose .",
    "comparisons of the psf magnitude and the aperture magnitude from the growth - curve method yielded aperture corrections . finally airmass corrections and photometric transformations were applied .    to convert the ukirt @xmath0 system to the cit @xmath0 system",
    ", we used the following transformation equations given by casali & hawarden ( 1992 ) , @xmath51",

    "the cmd data are available upon request to the authors or the electronic version of the journal .",
    "off - cluster field populations were not obtained during our observation , therefore , the field star contamination is not removed in our cmds .",
    "since palomar  6 lies near the galactic center , the off - cluster field contamination is expected to be very high ( see below ) , and probably variable due to differential reddening .",
    "our photometric measurements range from the rgb - tip to @xmath1 2 mag below the rhb .",

    "the scatter in the rgb sequences appear to be larger in ( @xmath54 ) than in ( @xmath55 ) .",
