    "after the discovery of half - metallic ferromagnetism in half - heusler alloy nimnsb by de groot et al.@xcite many of the compounds were found to be half - metallic in different experimental @xcite and theoretical studies@xcite .",
    "the half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmfs ) have band gap at the fermi level ( _ e@xmath3 _ ) in one spin channel while the other spin channel is strongly metallic .",
    "these materials show a complete spin polarization of the conduction electrons at the",
    "_ _ e@xmath3__. because of their exceptional band structures at the _ e@xmath3 _ , these materials are of great interest from theoretical and applications point of view .",
    "co containing full - heusler alloys were firstly proposed by ishida et al.@xcite and were synthesised by webster@xcite .",
    "fe@xmath0mnz type heusler alloys have also been proposed to show half - metallic ferromagnetism by fujii et al.@xcite . in the family of fe",
    "based heusler alloys only fe@xmath0mnsi@xcite and fe@xmath0crz ( z = si , ge , sn ) @xcite were predicted to be half - metallic ferromagnts theoretically .",
    "fe@xmath0mnsi is a ferromagnetic material with a curie temperature of 214 k and transforms at 69 k to the low temperature phase with smaller spontaneous magnetization @xcite .",
    "the total magnetic moment of fe@xmath0mnsi obtained by magnetization measurements is 2.1 @xmath4/f.u .",

    "fe@xmath0mnal on the other hand is not a half - metallic as there exist slight density of states at the _ e@xmath3 _ for minority spin channel @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) schemes for the exchange - correlation potential are not sufficient to describe the electronic structure and magnetism of some heusler alloys like co@xmath0fesi@xcite .",
    "such strongly correlated systems which contain atoms with open _ d _ or _ f _ shells , can be treated by adding on - site coulomb interaction ( _ u _ ) term as modification to lsda i.e. by using lsda + _ u _ approach @xcite .",
    "the lsda + _ u _ method accounts an orbital - dependent on - site electron - electron coulomb interaction which is not included in the pure lda or gga .",

    "they have also concluded that some co - based heusler alloys show half - metallic character when are treated with lsda + _ u_. it is well known that the systems in which there exist the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy for one spin , the on - site coulomb interaction ( _ u _ ) may bring a drastic change into their electronic and magnetic properties @xcite . as the electron - electron correlation plays an important role in the heusler compounds so it can be expected that it will also affect the fe - based heusler alloys .    in the present work",
    "we have employed the full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave methods to compute the electronic and magnetic properties of three full - heusler alloys viz .",
    "fe@xmath0mnsi , fe@xmath0mnal , and co@xmath0mnge .",
    "the electronic structures in the fm solutions without _ u _ show that fe@xmath0mnsi is half - metallic compound whereas fe@xmath0mnal is metallic .",
    "the large effect of _ u _ is observed on the electronic structures and magnetic moments of fe - based compounds whereas on co@xmath0mnge compound its effect is negligibly small .",
    "the magnetic moment of fe atom increases with _ u _ and in the mn atom it decreases with _ u_. the magnetic moments of fe and mn atoms are found to be coupled ferromagnetically in fe@xmath0mnsi for all values of _ u _ , whereas in fe@xmath0mnal they coupled antiferromagnetically below _",
    "u _ = 2 ev and ferromagnetically above it .",
    "the ground state of fe - based compounds remains half - metallic for all values of _ u _ , whereas it changes from metallic to semiconductor in fe@xmath0mnal after _",
    "u _ = 2 ev .",
    "also the ferromagnetic coupling between fe and mn atom is found to be responsible for the presence of semiconducting ground state in this compound .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of fe@xmath1mnsi , fe@xmath1mnal and co@xmath1mnge were calculated by using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method within the density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in wien2k code@xcite . the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) of perdew and",

    "@xcite formulation of the dft was also considered in the calculations . the around - the - mean - field ( amf ) version of the lsda+__u _ _ @xcite method was employed to account for the `` double - counting '' correction terms in the energy functional .",
    "the effective coulomb - exchange interaction _ _ u__@xmath6 is given by ( _ u _ - _ j _ ) , where _ u _ and _ j _ are the coulomb and exchange parameter . the value of _ u _ was varied from 1 to 5 ev and _ j _ was kept fixed to 0 ev , therefor _",

    "1(b ) it is clear that in fe@xmath1mnal the bands labeled by 1 - 5 are lying above the _ e@xmath3 _ , bands 6 and 7 which are crossing the _ e@xmath3 _ at 10 different k - points and band 8 is lying just below it .",

    "this figure shows that the spin - up channel of co@xmath1mnge is metallic for all values of _ u _ and down spin channel is semiconducting . as the value of _ u _",

    "the band gap is found to increase from @xmath21.0 ev at _ u _ = 2 ev to @xmath21.4 ev at _ u _ = 4 ev .",
    "we have not observed any significant shifting in the tdos for both spin channels .",

    "very few experimental work related to fe@xmath1mnal compound is found in the literature . in order to verify our predicted result",
    "it is necessary to perform electrical conductivity and neutron diffraction experiments , which directly probe the electronic transport behaviour and the nature of magnetic coupling between the fe and mn moments . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no experimental data on electrical conductivity in the @xmath12 phase",
    ". however liu et al .",
    "@xcite have reported resistivity data of the compound when it is in the b@xmath1 phase , which show insulating behaviour at the low temperature .",
    "similarly neutron diffraction experiments on fe@xmath1mnsi compound are also desirable to know the magnetic moments of the fe and mn atoms . these experiments will help in understanding the role of on - site coulomb interaction among the 3__d _ _ electrons of fe and mn by studying the magnitude and directions of the magnetic moments of fe and mn atoms in the fe@xmath1mnsi and fe@xmath1mnal compounds .",
    "the full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave methods have been employed to study the electronic and magnetic properties of fe@xmath0mnsi , fe@xmath0mnal and co@xmath0mnge .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( fm ) solutions without using on - site coulomb interaction _ u _ show the presence of half - metallic fm ground state in fe@xmath0mnsi however , in fe@xmath0mnal the ground state is found to be metallic .",
    "the total magnetic moment is contributed by mn atom with small contribution from fe atom in both cases .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of fe@xmath0mnsi and fe@xmath0mnal are affected significantly by _ u _ , whereas the almost negligible effect of _ u _ is found in co@xmath1mnge .",
    "the magnetic moment of fe atom in fe - based compounds is found to increase with _ u _ and for mn atom its value decreases . in fe@xmath1mnsi",
    "the fe and mn moments are coupled ferromagnetically for all values of u , whereas in fe@xmath1mnal they coupled antiferromagnetically below u = 2 ev and ferromagnetically above it .",
    "the study of electronic structures show that in fe@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath1mnge the ground state remains half - metallic ferromagnetic for all values of _ u _ , whereas in fe@xmath0mnal compound the ground state become semiconducting after _ u _ = 2 ev .",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling between fe and mn moments appears to be responsible for this in fe@xmath0mnal compound .",
