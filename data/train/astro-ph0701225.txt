    "stellar jets interact dynamically with their parent accretion disk in two fundamental ways .",
    "first , they extract angular momentum from the inner part of the disk @xcite , a theoretical prediction that has been confirmed recently by the observation of velocity asymmetries in the jet of rw auriga @xcite .",
    "second , a stellar jet has been proposed as the physical carrier of high temperature minerals from the sun s vicinity to the outer parts of the early solar system @xcite .",
    "the discovery of calcium - aluminum rich inclusions in the grains of comet wild 2 collected by stardust seem to confirm this hypothesis .    in this paper , we study a new dynamical interaction between the disk and jet that arises from the asymmetric removal of linear momentum from the star - disk system .",
    "a growing number of stellar jets appear to be asymmetric as the ejection velocities of the jet and counterjet differ by about a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "jet launching regions are confined to the inner part of the disk with estimates from 0.01 au for the x - wind model to a few au for disk - wind models ( e.g. 1.6 au for rw auriga , @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated momentum loss over the launching region accelerates the center of mass of the star - disk system which coincides with the star s center for axisymmetric systems .",
    "a gas element in the outer disk sees the matter around which it revolves accelerating and responds dynamically to such change .",
    "this response is the object of this work .",
    "an order of magnitude for the acceleration is obtained from the observed mass loss rates and ejection velocities in disk - jet systems as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the star s mass augmented by that of the jet launching region of the disk , @xmath2 is the mass loss rate , and @xmath3 is the jet s ejection velocity @xcite .",
    "this estimate is an instantaneous lower bound on the total momentum loss as we lack long time span observations of stellar jets as well as observations of the jet engine within a few au from the star .",
    "although small , the acceleration amplitude ( [ acc - mag ] ) was shown to offer a possible explanation for the large eccentricities and secular resonances of extrasolar planets orbits provided the planets formed in a jet - sustaining disk ( @xcite hereafter paper i ) . over the duration of the asymmetric jet episode , the star - disk system acquires a residual velocity , @xmath4 , that must be smaller than the stellar velocity dispersion in the galaxy , @xmath5 .",
    "this constraint yields an upper bound on the duration of the asymmetric jet episode , @xmath6 , as : @xmath7 where we used @xmath8 .",
    "asymmetric momentum removal would contribute at most a few kms@xmath9 to the observed velocity dispersion of young stars ( of order a few tens of kms@xmath9 , @xcite ) leading to an upper bound on the jet s lifetime comparable to the viscous time of the disk .",
    "the observation of ( the same ) asymmetric jets since 1994 , yields a lower bound of @xmath10 years on how long asymmetric jets may be sustained .",
    "jet asymmetry may have two origins : the ambient medium and/or an asymmetric magnetic field that threads the disk .",
    "the former @xcite has the advantage of not adding more complex geometries to the magnetic field responsible for jet generation .",
    "the latter option of an asymmetric magnetic field has been considered in the context of agn systems where it has been shown to warp the inner parts of the accretion disks through the asymmetric local magnetic pressure @xcite .",
    "future observations inside a few au from the central star will help elucidate the origin of jet asymmetry .    in this work , we show that the acceleration of the star - inner - disk system with respect to the outer disk ( section 2 ) alters the disk s state of minimum energy from a plane to a sombrero - shaped surface curved along the direction of acceleration ( section 3 ) .",
    "this flaring geometry has new consequences for the stellar irradiation of the disk ( section 4 ) as well as for its vertical structure ( section 5 ) .",
    "jet time - variability is reflected in the varying acceleration imparted locally to the disk leading to the global radial expansion and contraction of the disk ( section 6 ) .",
    "these results are summed up in section 7 by illustrating the disk s response as the jet is launched , and discussing their possible application to the hh30 disk - jet system .",
    "jet - induced acceleration arises from the removal of momentum from the star - disk system ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) in an inertial frame . to see this",
    ", we divide the star - disk system into three particles : the star , an inner disk materialized by a particle that looses mass and linear momentum located at 0.5 au , and the outer disk materialized by a constant mass particle located far outside , for instance at 50 au .",
    "this is justified because the jet launching region is confined to the inner part of the disk .",
    "gauss s theorem ( the divergence theorem ) for the gravitational potential of the form @xmath11 implies that the outer particle ( outer disk ) orbits around the combined masses of the star and the inner particle ( the inner disk ) which form what we shall call the central object .",
    "the outer particle is not concerned by the details of mass and momentum losses in the central object around which it revolves , it only responds to them . the central object or more accurately , the center of mass of the star and the inner disk , is loosing mass and linear momentum .",
    "it is therefore being accelerated with respect to the outer particle by an amount equal to the ratio of the momentum loss rate from the inner particle divided by the total mass of the central object note that the inner particle itself is accelerated by the ratio of the momentum loss rate to its mass .",
    "the two - body problem , central object - outer particle , being symmetric , this also amounts to saying that the outer particle is accelerated with respect to the central object that remains stationary .",
    "this shows that the outer particle evolution may be described by the equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the position and velocity and @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass @xmath1 is that of the star augmented by that of the inner particle and corresponds to the total mass contained in the jet launching region .",
    "the acceleration @xmath16 is obtained as the ratio of the total momentum loss to the total mass @xmath1 . in practice , we can neglect the contributions of the disk s mass and its variations in @xmath1 for two reasons .",
    "first , the mass of the inner disk is small compared to the mass of the star .",
    "second , the mass loss is small and amounts to a correspondingly small dynamical effect given by the jeans radial migration rate @xmath17yr@xmath9 for @xmath18yr@xmath9 @xcite .    from this simple picture",
    ", we can understand what goes on in an extended continuous disk .",
    "mass and linear momentum loss modify the disk s equations of motion by including the disk s gravitational potential as well as the momentum loss from the disk ( in the case of disk winds ) .",
    "the contribution of the disk s potential is negligible because the disk s mass is small and the migration resulting from mass loss is also small . as for the momentum loss",
    ", it is a function of the radius , @xmath19 , that represents the integrated momentum loss up to @xmath19 .",
    "calling @xmath20 the outer radius of the jet launching region , then for @xmath21 , the acceleration is not a function of @xmath19 as it represents the total momentum loss from the star - disk system . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the variation with @xmath19 of the momentum loss depends on the model of jet generation .",
    "being interested in the flaring of the disk which mostly concerns its outer parts , we may employ eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) to describe the evolution of a gas element located outside of the jet launching region where @xmath23 is independent of @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the steady state of the disk and accordingly take @xmath16 to be constant .",
    "the dynamical problem described by equation ( [ motion ] ) has two constants of motion , the energy @xmath24 , and the projected component of the angular momentum @xmath25 on the direction of acceleration @xmath26 .    before discussing the situation where the jet is not perpendicular to the disk , we first assume that the acceleration lies along the disk s plane normal .",
    "least energy orbits make up the invariable surface of the disk  if there is no acceleration , this surface is the disk s midplane .",
    "we determine the orbits of least energy by making use of cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and by expressing the conservation of the vertical component of angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the energy equation then reads :    @xmath30    minimizing the energy integral yields @xmath31 which corresponds to circular orbits and shows that @xmath19 and @xmath28 are not independent as the star s pull balances the acceleration @xmath23 according to : @xmath32 the vertical location of a circular orbit of radius @xmath19 and its orbital rotation rate , @xmath33 , are given as : @xmath34^\\frac{1}{2 } , \\ \\ \\",
    "\\omega= \\left[\\frac{gm}{\\left(r^2+z^2\\right)^{3/2}}\\right]^\\frac{1}{2 } \\label{sombrero}.\\ ] ] we see that orbits of least energy are circular but do not lie in the equator plane of the star , instead they hover above it in the direction of acceleration . the locus of circular orbits in the @xmath35plane is shown in fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] , upper panel )",
    ". however , not all circular orbits are stable in the long term .",
    "there is a natural truncation radius around the star where the star s gravitational acceleration becomes comparable to @xmath23 ( paper i ) . beyond this radius ,",
    "the star s pull is weak and orbits escape its gravity .",
    "the location of this radius denoted @xmath36 is given by the equality of the acceleration excitation time @xmath37 ( paper i ) and the orbital period @xmath38 .",

    "the profile thus obtained is that of a sombrero as shown in fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "we call @xmath40 the stable disk profile obtained by inverting equation ( [ sombrero ] )",
    ". we will also use the linearized profile , @xmath41 for @xmath42 which reads : @xmath43 .",
    "we remark that the sombrero profile coincides with the steady state profile of a thin jet - sustaining disk . for ( realistic ) thick disks",
    ", the sombrero corresponds to the invariable surface , the equivalent of the disk s midplane if there were no acceleration , as well as to the disk s surface of maximum density ( section 5 ) . in the case where the acceleration is not initially perpendicular to the disk ,",
    "the state of least energy is still a sombrero whose symmetry axis is that of the acceleration . to reach this state , the disk experiences a transient phase during which it dissipates energy ( section 6 ) .",
    "the stellar irradiation of a flat thin disk ( i.e. a planar disk with zero thickness ) with no jet - induced acceleration yields a decreasing temperature profile with distance @xcite .",
    "it is given as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the disk s temperature , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the star s temperature and radius respectively .",
    "for a non - planar disk , the disk s temperature at distance @xmath19 from the star is related to the stellar temperature through : @xmath48\\ \\left[\\frac{r_*}{r}\\right]^2 , \\label{eqn11}\\ ] ] @xcite where @xmath28 is the vertical location of the disk and @xmath49 . for @xmath42",

    "\\mbox{k}.\\label{td}\\ ] ] the fundamental state of the disk therefore has a residual temperature regardless of radius .",
    "the sombrero profile cancels out the @xmath53 distance factor responsible for the decrease of temperature with distance .",
    "relaxing @xmath42 and using the full shape of @xmath41 leads to a modest temperature increase with distance .",
    "the increase and decrease of the slopes of @xmath54 on both sides of the sombrero for a finite thickness disk will make the temperature grow beyond the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ td ] ) for the upper side of the disk and exposes the lower side to some irradiation .",
    "the unequal heating of jet - sustaining disks therefore sets a local vertical temperature gradient that leads to the stratification of the disk .",
    "for a disk with a finite thickness , we may seek the vertical profile obtained from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equations are now modified by the presence of the vertical acceleration @xmath16 .",
    "assuming an isothermal disk of pressure @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the density and @xmath57 the sound speed , the hydrostatic equilibrium equation reads : @xmath58 whose solution is : @xmath59.\\label{hydro}\\ ] ] the sombrero profile here corresponds to the surface of maximum density . with respect to this profile and where @xmath42 , the disk s thickness , @xmath60 , is similar to that of an unaccelerated disk .",
    "this solution however has a flaw : the linear term related to the acceleration yields an infinite disk mass when @xmath56 is integrated over all space .",
    "the finite value of @xmath56 for large positive @xmath28 is indicative of a matter outflow from the upper side of the disk in response to the lowering of the vertical pull of the star by the acceleration @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , eq . ( [ hydroeq ] )",
    "can no longer describe the vertical state of the disk .",
    "the steady state properties of the new wind component may be described by the unmagnetized grad - shafranov equation @xcite subject to the finite duration acceleration @xmath16 .",
    "we expect the density and velocity profile of the wind component to bear some resemblance to the hydrodynamic jets generated as force - free vortex funnels in accretion disks @xcite .",
    "stellar jets are time - variable processes @xcite . to ascertain the consequences of the jet - induced acceleration s time variations , we first consider an initially circular planar disk subject to a vertical acceleration of magnitude @xmath23 .",
    "this models an instantaneous increase of acceleration from zero to @xmath23 . solving the vertical equation of motion in ( [ motion ] ) under the assumption that @xmath42 yields : @xmath61    the vertical motion is an oscillation with respect to the linearized sombrero profile @xmath41 on a timescale equal to the local orbital period in the disk , @xmath62 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is given by the distance from the initial state which in this case is the equator plane to the location of the sombrero profile .",
    "if the acceleration grew from zero to @xmath23 on a timescale , @xmath63 , longer than the orbital period , @xmath62 , the disk s midsurface height @xmath28 would follow the evolving sombrero profile adiabatically and there will be no oscillation with respect to the surface of least energy . to illustrate the two excitation regimes , sudden and adiabatic , we show in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) the response of the disk s midsurface height obtained by numerically integrating the equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "the acceleration s time dependence is taken as @xmath64)\\times w(t)$ ] where @xmath65 , the same magnitude as in fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) , and @xmath66 is a window function that vanishes outside the range [ 0,5000yr ] and equals unity inside it .",
    "the minimum truncation radius is therefore 500au .",
    "as the launching timescale is @xmath67yr , the disk evolves adiabatically to the sombrero profile inside 22au as can be seen on @xmath68 at @xmath69au ( @xmath70yr ) in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "outside 22au , the dynamical time @xmath62 is longer than the launching timescale of 100yr implying that jet launching is perceived as a sudden excitation by most of the outer disk whose typical response is described by eq .",
    "( [ vertical ] ) and shown in fig ( [ f3 ] ) for @xmath71au .",
    "the acceleration is shut off suddenly after 5000yr .",
    "this determines an outer limit , @xmath72au , in the disk beyond which the state of least energy remains the disk s initial state ( star s equator plane ) as the dynamical time outside this radius is too long to travel all the way to the location of the sombrero profile ( eq . [ vertical ] ) . beyond this radius ,",
    "the jet - induced acceleration episode is felt as a short ( with respect to the orbital period ) velocity pulse to the outer disk resulting in the excitation of vertical motion with respect to the disk s initial midplane as seen in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) for @xmath73au .",
    "this type of excitation has been discussed extensively in paper i ( section 6 ) .",
    "the sudden absence of acceleration is felt everywhere in the disk , where for instance at @xmath69au , the lack of the jet - induced acceleration that balanced the star s vertical gravitational pull leads to a vertical oscillation with respect to the equator plane and with an amplitude equal to the distance from the sombrero to that plane .",
    "this effect is the same as the excitation described by eq .",
    "( [ vertical ] ) only this time the invariable surface is the disk s midplane and the initial state is the sombrero profile .",
    "for both the accelerated and unaccelerated phases , the vertical oscillations with respect to the surface of least energy ( be it a sombrero if @xmath74 or a plane if @xmath75 ) are damped by the viscous stresses of the disk . for instance , in a more realistic simulation taking into account the disk s viscosity , the observed oscillations about the sombrero height @xmath76 for @xmath71au , would be erased and the disk would settle into the sombrero profile before the acceleration is shut off at @xmath77yr .",
    "we note that the illustration of the disk s midsurface height response to the acceleration s growth shown here is not peculiar to the launching of the jet and equally represents the disk s response to more general variations of the jet - induced acceleration as those associated with a varying ejection velocity at the source @xcite .      for a time - variable acceleration , the conservation of the specific angular momentum @xmath78 forces the mean orbital radius to change in order to compensate for the increase of the midsurface height @xmath28 to the location of sombrero profile .",
    "the rate of this change is found using the conservation of @xmath79 only as :    @xmath80    where we neglected a term of second order in @xmath54 .",
    "the rate  ( [ hz ] ) is valid regardless of the time dependence of @xmath23 and whether the initial state of the disk is planar .",
    "the change in radius is of second order in @xmath23 and leads to a radial expansion of the disk if the acceleration increases with time .",
    "if however @xmath23 decreases , the midsurface height @xmath28 is lowered to the new sombrero location and eq .",
    "( [ hz ] ) shows that the disk undergoes a radial contraction .",
    "the expansion and contraction occur on the local dynamical time @xmath62 if it is larger than the variability timescale @xmath81 ( as in eq .",
    "[ vertical ] ) .",
    "otherwise , radial motion occurs adiabatically with respect to variability . outside the radius where @xmath82 , it is the former evolution that takes place implying that contraction and expansion start from the inside of the disk and proceed outward ( as @xmath62 increases with @xmath19 ) .",
    "the local radial displacement @xmath83 is given as : @xmath84 ^ 4 \\label{exp - con}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 if the acceleration s change is sudden , @xmath86 .",
    "for an adiabatic change , @xmath87 , the averaging of the linearized equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) yields @xmath88 .",
    "the outer half of the disk is the most affected by the expansion and contraction : at the disk s median radius , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "we also note that this rate is much larger than that of the jeans migration ( section 2 ) .",
    "figure  ( [ f4 ] ) shows the local expansion and contraction of the disk at different radii under the same conditions as those of the previous section and fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) . at @xmath69au",
    "the expansion is adiabatic as the launching timescale @xmath81 is larger than the dynamical time , while the contraction is sudden as the acceleration is abruptly turned off . where the dynamical timescale is much larger than the acceleration s duration as for @xmath73au ,",
    "there is a net radial expansion outward as the whole acceleration episode is felt as a velocity kick to the outer disk ( paper i , section 6 )  note for instance how for @xmath73 au , the expansion appears to be delayed until the end of the acceleration phase .",
    "another consequence of the acceleration s variability is the local excitation of eccentricity in the disk . using the linearized equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) for the radius @xmath19",
    ", it can be shown that the local eccentricity growth rate due to the vertical acceleration is : @xmath91 with a secular turnaround time equal to @xmath92 .",
    "the maximum eccentricity is therefore @xmath93 .",
    "we note that the eccentricity gradient @xmath94 is always smaller than unity implying that the forced eccentric distortions of the gas streamlines do not make them cross and consequently they do not shock .",
    "the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ ecc - rate ] ) is valid during the acceleration phase . outside the location where the dynamical time is smaller than the duration of the acceleration phase ,",
    "the net effect of acceleration amounts to a small amplitude velocity kick imparted to the disk . to the fluid elements of the disk s midplane",
    ", the velocity kick imparts an eccentricity given as ( paper i , section 6 ) : @xmath95 where @xmath4 is the total velocity obtained by integrating the acceleration over its duration .",
    "the global response of the disk s viscous stresses to the eccentric disturbance ( [ ecc - rate ] ) depends on the prescription of the viscous stresses that is employed as well as on the density profile @xcite .",
    "we expect the viscous stresses to damp the eccentric distortions as well as the vertical oscillations leading to the heating of the disk . in the outermost part of the accretion disk where the dynamical time",
    "is long compared to the acceleration s duration and where the viscous timescale is similarly long , we expect jet - sustaining accretion disks to exhibit global eccentric distortions .",
    "stellar jets are ubiquitous processes of star formation and star - disk interaction . the asymmetric removal of linear momentum from the star - disk system accelerates the outer part of the disk with respect the jet launching region .",
    "the acceleration amplitude is small ( [ acc - mag ] ) and can be modeled as a time dependent vector directed along the star s rotation axis .",
    "the state of minimum energy of the disk is a sombrero - shaped surface made up of circular planar orbits that hover above the star s equator plane ( [ sombrero ] ) increasingly higher with distance . as the jet is launched , the initially circular equator disk moves towards the state of minimum energy and the truncation radius moves from infinity to the location given by ( [ akplr ] ) .",
    "if the disk s size is larger than the minimum truncation radius over the acceleration phase , the disk will be truncated by the jet - induced acceleration . there is a specific radius in the disk where the orbital period @xmath62 matches the jet launching timescale @xmath81 . inside this radius ,",
    "the disk moves away from the equator plane to the instantaneous sombrero surface adiabatically .",
    "outside the matching radius , vertical motion ( [ vertical ] ) as well as eccentricity distortions ( [ ecc - rate ] ) with respect to the sombrero are excited .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum implies that as the jet is launched the disk expands radially ( [ hz],[exp - con ] ) .",
    "viscous stresses damp the vertical motion and the eccentricity distortions to heat up the disk especially in its outer regions .",
    "the steady state of the disk thus assumes a sombrero profile that exposes the upper face of the disk to the star s light canceling at first order the irradiation s decrease with distance ( [ td ] ) .",
    "the disk can not maintain hydrostatic equilibrium under the jet acceleration ( [ hydro ] ) . instead the disk looses mass from its upper side giving rise to a secondary asymmetric wind component .",
    "when the jet - induced acceleration decreases , the sombrero looses curvature , the disk contracts radially at the rate given by ( [ exp - con ] ) and the truncation radius moves outward ( [ akplr ] ) .    the mechanisms discussed above only require the onset of asymmetric momentum removal in the star - disk system .",
    "whether momentum is removed from the star itself through some peculiar stellar wind component , or more realistically from the disk or the star - disk interface @xcite , the outer disk will respond to the integrated momentum loss from the matter around which it gravitates .",
    "the mechanisms discussed above also do not have a time requirement on the acceleration s duration .",
    "the evolution towards the sombrero , the radial contraction and expansion proceed from the inner part of the disk outwards .",
    "therefore , these mechanisms affect the disk inside the radius where the dynamical time is comparable to the acceleration s duration . in this sense",
    ", disk observations can be used to constrain the duration of the jet episode and/or asymmetric momentum removal by identifying the outermost radius where relaxation toward the sombrero profile has taken place .",
    "asymmetric momentum removal imprints two more signatures on the star - disk system : the presence of a global eccentric distortion in the outermost part of the disk , and an enhancement of the random component of the stellar velocity in the galaxy .",
    "the eccentric distortion results from a perceived sudden pull of the star - inner disk system with respect to the outer disk along the jet system s axis and should be an increasing function of radius ( [ ecc - rateout ] ) that does not depend on the acceleration s timescales .",
    "the change in the stellar velocity dispersion may be ascertained by statistically analyzing young stars proper motion at different epochs of their evolution .",
    "a good illustration of some of the new properties discussed above is found in the hh 30 disk - jet system .",
    "this system @xcite is a nearly edge - on @xmath96 au disk that appears as two reflection nebulosities separated by a dark lane .",
    "the jet and counterjet appear to be asymmetric although both the ejection speed and the mass loss rate remain uncertain @xcite",
    ". the jet exhibits variability in the form of knots with periods of 2.5 years @xcite .",
    "the disk s variable lateral asymmetries appear mainly on one side of the disk with possible periods from a few days to a few years @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported the observation of a molecular outflow emanating from the upper nebulosity .",
    "the outflow was traced back to a scale smaller than the size of the disk while no rotation signatures were detected above 1 kms@xmath9 at 200 au .",
    "the variable lateral asymmetries are currently explained by the presence of a single hot spot on the star requiring a complex magnetic field structure that differentiates substantially between the two stellar poles @xcite .",
    "if the one - sided outflow resulted from the entrainment of surrounding material then the cloud structure would be substantially different on both sides of the disk . in the context of the jet - disk interaction studied here , it is natural to attribute the lack of lateral asymmetries in the lower nebulosity to a change in the disk s mean profile , and to identify the one - sided molecular outflow as the new secondary wind component .",
    "further modeling of the disk temperature , wind density and velocity profiles produced by the jet - induced acceleration will help determine the properties of the hh 30 disk and its molecular outflow .",

    "<S> jet systems with two unequal components interact with their parent accretion disks through the asymmetric removal of linear momentum from the star - disk system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as a result of this interaction , the disk s state of least energy is not made up of orbits that lie in a plane containing the star s equator as in a disk without a jet . </S>",
    "<S> the disk s profile has the shape of a sombrero curved in the direction of acceleration . for this novel state of minimum energy , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the temperature profile of thin disks . the flaring geometry caused by the sombrero profile increases the disk temperature especially in its outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> the jet - induced acceleration disturbs the vertical equilibrium of the disk leading to mass loss in the form of a secondary wind emanating from the upper face of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> jet time variability causes the disk to radially expand or contract depending on whether the induced acceleration increases or decreases . </S>",
    "<S> jet time variability also excites vertical motion and eccentric distortions in the disk and affects the sombrero profile s curvature . </S>",
    "<S> these perturbations lead to the heating of the disk through its viscous stresses as it tries to settle into the varying state of minimum energy . </S>",
    "<S> the jet - disk interaction studied here will help estimate the duration of the jet episode in star - disk systems and may explain the origin of the recently observed one - sided molecular outflow of the hh 30 disk - jet system . </S>"
