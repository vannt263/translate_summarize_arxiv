    "several new excited charmed baryon states have been observed by babar , belle and cleo collaborations , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the charmed baryons provide a rich source of states , including possible candidates for the orbital excitations . they serve as an excellent ground for testing predictions of the constituent quark models and heavy quark symmetry @xcite .",
    "the charmed and bottomed baryons , which contain a heavy quark and two light quarks , provides an ideal tool for studying dynamics of the light quarks in the presence of a heavy quark .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks form an @xmath14 flavor triplet , @xmath15 , two light quarks can form diquarks with a symmetric sextet and an antisymmetric antitriplet . for the @xmath16-wave baryons ,",
    "the sextet contains both spin-@xmath17 and spin-@xmath18 states , while the antitriplet contains only spin-@xmath17 states . by now ,",
    "the @xmath19 antitriplet states ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the @xmath19 and @xmath22 sextet states ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) have been established .",
    "the baryon @xmath25 , a @xmath26 candidate for the @xmath18 partner of the strange baryon @xmath27 , was observed by babar collaboration in the radiative decay @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 baryon @xmath29 was reconstructed in decays to the final states @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it lies about @xmath34 above the @xmath35 , and it is the last singly - charmed baryon with zero orbital momentum observed experimentally @xcite .    in this article , we calculate the mass and residue of the @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 as byproduct , the @xmath37 has not been observed experimentally yet ) with the qcd sum rules @xcite . in the qcd sum rules ,",
    "operator product expansion is used to expand the time - ordered currents into a series of quark and gluon condensates which parameterize the long distance properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "based on current - hadron duality , we can obtain copious information about the hadronic parameters at the phenomenological side .    the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the masses and residues of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 in section 2 ; in section 3 , numerical results and discussions ; section 4 is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation functions @xmath38 in the qcd sum rules approach , @xmath39 where the upper index @xmath40 represents the @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks respectively ; the @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for the rarita - schwinger spin vector and residue of the baryon @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are color indexes , @xmath49 is charge conjunction matrix , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are lorentz indexes .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath52 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath53 due to lorentz covariance . the first structure @xmath54 has an odd number of @xmath55-matrices and conserves chirality , the second structure @xmath56 has an even number of @xmath55-matrices and violate chirality . in the original qcd sum rules analysis of the nucleon masses and magnetic moments @xcite",
    ", the interval of dimensions ( of the condensates ) for the odd structure is larger than the interval of dimensions for the even structure , one may expect a better accuracy of results obtained from the sum rules with the odd structure .    in this article",
    ", we choose the two tensor structures to study the masses and residues of the heavy baryons @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as the masses of the heavy quarks break the chiral symmetry explicitly .    according to basic assumption of current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite",
    ", we insert a complete series of intermediate states satisfying unitarity principle with the same quantum numbers as the current operator @xmath57 into the correlation functions in eq.(1 ) to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the pole terms of the lowest states @xmath45 , we obtain the following result : @xmath58 where we have used the relation to sum over the rarita - schwinger spin vector , @xmath59    in the following , we briefly outline operator product expansion for the correlation functions @xmath60 in perturbative qcd theory .",
    "the calculations are performed at large space - like momentum region @xmath61 , which corresponds to small distance @xmath62 required by validity of operator product expansion .",
    "we write down the `` full '' propagators @xmath63 and @xmath64 of a massive quark in the presence of the vacuum condensates firstly @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then contract the quark fields in the correlation functions @xmath52 with wick theorem , and obtain the result : @xmath68 substitute the full @xmath13 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 quark propagators into above correlation functions and complete the integral in coordinate space , then integrate over the variable @xmath48 , we can obtain the correlation functions @xmath69 at the level of quark - gluon degree of freedom :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 .",
    "we carry out operator product expansion to the vacuum condensates adding up to dimension-6 . in calculation , we take assumption of vacuum saturation for high dimension vacuum condensates , they are always factorized to lower condensates with vacuum saturation in the qcd sum rules , factorization works well in large @xmath72 limit . in this article , we take into account the contributions from the quark condensate @xmath73 , mixed condensate @xmath74 , gluon condensate @xmath75 , and neglect the contributions from other high dimension condensates , which are suppressed by large denominators and would not play significant roles .",
    "once analytical results are obtained , then we can take current - hadron duality below the threshold @xmath76 and perform borel transformation with respect to the variable @xmath77 , finally we obtain the following sum rules :    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    differentiate the above sum rules with respect to the variable @xmath82 , then eliminate the quantity @xmath83 , we obtain two qcd sum rules for the masses @xmath84 :    @xmath85    and @xmath86",
    "the input parameters are taken to be the standard values @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite . the contribution from the gluon condensate @xmath95 is less than @xmath96 , and the uncertainty is neglected here .    for the octet baryons with @xmath97 ,",
    "the mass of the proton ( the ground state ) is @xmath98 , and the mass of the first radial excited state @xmath99 ( the roper resonance ) is @xmath100 @xcite . for the decuplet baryons with @xmath101 ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath102 ( the ground state ) is @xmath103 , and the mass of the first radial excited state @xmath104 is @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the separation between the ground states and first radial excited states is about @xmath106 .",
    "so in the qcd sum rules for the baryons with the light quarks , the threshold parameters @xmath107 are always chosen to be @xmath108 @xcite , here @xmath109 stands for the ground states .",
    "the threshold parameters for the heavy baryons @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be chosen to be @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the mass of the bottomed baryon @xmath37 with spin - parity @xmath2 is about @xmath112 , which is predicted by the quark models and lattice qcd @xcite .    . the contributions from different terms in the sum rules for the @xmath36 with the central values of the input parameters",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this article , the threshold parameters and borel parameters are taken as @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the charmed baryon @xmath36 , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the bottomed baryon @xmath37 .",
    "the contributions from different terms for the central values of the input parameters are presented in table.1 and table.2 , respectively . from the two tables",
    ", we can expect convergence of the operator product expansion .",
    "in the two sum rules in eqs.(11 - 12 ) , the contributions from the terms proportional to the quark condensate @xmath117 and mixed condensate @xmath118 are suppressed due to the small mass @xmath119 comparing with the terms proportional to the @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , from the full propagator of the @xmath13 quark , we can see that the mixed condensate @xmath118 is companied with additional large denominators , its contribution is even smaller . in the right - hand side of eqs.(11 - 12 ) ,",
    "the terms proportional to the @xmath120 are suppressed by the exponents @xmath121 $ ] , which is balanced by the factor @xmath122 $ ] in the left - hand side .",
    "although the masses of the @xmath41 quark and @xmath36 baryon are much smaller than the corresponding ones of the @xmath42 quark and @xmath37 baryon , the borel parameters @xmath123 are different , for the central values of the borel parameters @xmath123 , @xmath124 > \\exp [ m_{\\omega_c^*}^2/m^2-m^2_c / m^2]$ ] .",
    "it is not unexpected , the contributions from the @xmath120 are larger in the sum rules for the @xmath37 baryon than the ones for the @xmath36 baryon .",
    "if we approximate the phenomenological spectral density with the perturbative term , the contribution from the pole term is as large as @xmath125 for the charmed baryon @xmath36 and @xmath126 for the bottomed baryon @xmath37 .",
    "we can choose smaller borel parameter @xmath123 or larger threshold parameters @xmath127 to enhance the contributions from the ground states .",
    "however , if we take larger threshold parameter @xmath127 , the contribution from the first radial excited state maybe included in ; on the other hand , for smaller borel parameter @xmath123 , the sum rules are not stable enough , the uncertainty with variation of the borel parameter is large . in the case of the multiquark states ,",
    "the standard criterion of the lowest pole dominance can not be satisfied , we have to resort to new criterion to overcome the problem , for detailed discussions about this subject , one can consult ref.@xcite .",
