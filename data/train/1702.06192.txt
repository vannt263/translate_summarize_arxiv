    "cancer cells proliferate at a high rate and can be considered as a dynamic population of agents that grow and divide without constraints @xcite ( at least in the early phase of avascular growth ) . in the present work , we aim to investigate this preliminary stage of a tumor growth . as such , this study could also help in understanding the development of 3d microtumours . here ,",
    "we examine a population initially composed of several tens of cells that proliferate to reach several hundreds of cells within a few days . in this situation ,",
    "the experimental model consists of cancer cells grown in a culture medium containing all the necessary nutrients for their growth and division .",
    "the proliferation of the population is restricted to a single layer , which permits the use of simple two dimensional simulation models for the comparisons . in the proposed simulation model",
    "we do not include a detailed description of the cell cycle and mitosis events .",
    "instead we focus on the role of the orientation of the cell division planes in the morphology of the tumor cells cluster .",
    "we aim to investigate how the orientation of cell divisions influences the structure of the cell lineages .",
    "in particular , we would like to determine whether cell lineages break up and whether they have different morphologies according to their initial position in the cell population .",
    "the impact of the orientation of the division plane on the organization of the population has been suggested from recent studies . in particular , the influence of the geometry of the cell , the influence of neighboring cells and the role of external mechanical forces on the determination of the orientation of the division plane have been studied in @xcite .",
    "recent results also suggest that the orientation of the division plane plays a role in the differentiation of stem cells @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent discoveries tend to establish a link between cancer and disorientation of the division plane @xcite : dysfunction in cells can lead to disorientation and , conversely , disorientation can promote the development of cancer .",
    "the above observations lead us to focus on two main questions related to the organization of a growing tumor cell population : what is the impact of the multiplication of cells on the global organization of the entire cell population ? does the orientation of the division plane influence the evolution of the cell population and the organization of its lineages ?",
    "the comparison of a mathematical model with biological experiments performed in this work shows that indeed a relation exists between division and organization and that lineages are strongly influenced by the initial position of the parental cell inside the population .",
    "there exists a large number of mathematical models in the literature describing cell proliferation and tumor growth .",
    "some recent review papers can be found in @xcite . among the different ways of representing cells",
    ", one usually distinguishes between discrete models and continuous models . in a discrete model @xcite ,",
    "each element is treated as a separate entity .",
    "this makes the comparison with experiments easy but the main drawback of this viewpoint is the huge computational cost when dealing with a large number of agents . on the other hand ,",
    "continuous models @xcite , which typically deal with an average density of cells , are more efficient when the system contains a large number of particles .",
    "however , it is difficult to establish direct links between the model parameters and the physical measures @xcite .",
    "comparisons between the two approaches can be found in @xcite , while hybrid models which employ both approaches at the same time can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "many models of the literature tend to be exhaustive in the description of the biological , physical and chemical phenomena .",
    "this leads to the introduction of many empirical parameters and makes the interpretation of the results difficult .",
    "our approach is opposite : it relies on a simple mathematical model which focuses on few determinants and attempts to explore some specific questions through comparisons with experiments .",
    "this approach permits to explore the influence of any single modeling choice more efficiently and to formulate hypotheses about which mechanisms are associated with given observations .",
    "we follow a bottom - up strategy which starts from simple rules and gradually adds complexity into the model until a good fit with the experiments is reached . rather than quantitative agreement",
    ", we look for similar trends between the model and the experiments when some key parameters are varied . here , we show that the sole growth and division mechanisms are not sufficient to explain the observed lineage morphologies and that additional phenomena must be taken into account in the model in order to reproduce the experimental results .",
    "the biological situation we wish to investigate is a small population composed of 20 up to about 500 cells in which proliferation and movement are restricted to a two - dimensional plane . for this specific situation",
    ", the best modeling choice is an individual based models ( ibm ) ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this permits to make the mathematical model reproduce the experiment and to consider objects moving only in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "in addition , since we seek to study the impact of the growth of cells and the influence of the orientation of division on the organization of the population , we need to be able to track individual entities . indeed , a continuous model will not give access to such information . on the other hand , a discrete model on a grid @xcite could introduce artificial bias on the organization of the cells and it will not allow us to explore orientation issues in depth , since the number of possible orientations is limited by the underlying grid @xcite .",
    "the mathematical setting chosen is finally the following : cells aggregate spontaneously , grow and divide .",
    "after each growth or division event , a mechanical equilibrium between aggregation and cell - cell non overlapping is supposed instantaneously reached and gives the instantaneous configuration of the population .",
    "thus motion arises from stresses between neighboring cells @xcite .",
    "this approach is different from more classical models based on introducing a repulsion potential between the cells @xcite .",
    "indeed , the temporal scale associated with cell ( quasi)-incompressibility is much faster than that involved in the growth of the tumor as a whole . modelling cell - cell non - overlapping via a repulsion potential requires making these two scales closer than they are in reality ( to ensure numerical stability ) , thereby introducing a bias in the numerical solution . in a current study @xcite , we intend to document precisely the difference between these two approaches .",
    "since cell - cell non - overlapping is associated with a faster scale than growth an approach based on realizing a mechanical equilibrium at every time step permit to bypass the numerical stability issue . during the time evolution of the system different lineages are tagged and compared with experimental data as done for instance in @xcite .",
    "comparisons between the mathematical model and the biological experiments show that a relation exists between geometric determinants of cell , division , and the organization of the cell population and that lineage shapes are strongly influenced by the initial position of the parental cell inside the population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss the mathematical model and the numerical method adopted .",
    "we also discuss the statistical indicators used to measure the results of the numerical simulations , the experimental protocol and the image processing . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we resume the principal results of the simulations and a first series of comparisons between the model and the experiments are presented and discussed . in section [ sec:4 ] improvements introduced to the model and new comparisons with the data are analyzed . in section [ sec:5 ] conclusions are drawn and future investigations are discussed .",
    "since the roles of division and growth in the lineage organization are at the center of this study , we must be able to track individual cells during time . in order to do that , we use an agent based mathematical model in which each cell is represented by a discrete entity . in this model ,",
    "a cell / agent is defined by its center , its radius and its orientation .",
    "only the plasma membrane is described .",
    "the details of the intracellular phenomena are omitted .",
    "the cell shape is chosen to be a two - dimensional disk which is incompressible and continuously growing in time .",
    "the notion of preferred orientation , linked to the alignment of chromosomes during mitosis , necessary to define the division plane , is not inherently modeled by the shape of the agent .",
    "instead it is an internal parameter owned by each agent which may vary with time depending on the chosen division strategy and detailed next .",
    "the cell evolution is determined only by the growth and the division laws , respectively describing the interphase and the mitotic steps of a cell cycle . to reproduce the experimental setting , cells are free to move and have access to all the required nutrients .",
    "cell cycle phases of growth and division alternate continuously ; cell cycle checkpoints , @xmath0 phase variability between cells and temporary cell cycle exits are excluded .",
    "the interphase is constituted solely of the cell growth phase : @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-phases are combined into a single no - division phase during which growth is assumed to be linear in time .",
    "the mitosis trigger occurs as soon as the cell reaches a critical size , which is the only control condition .",
    "conservation of the volume is imposed during the division process .",
    "agents interact by minimizing at each time the global mechanical energy of the system subject to a non - interpenetration constraint modeling the fact that living cells can not intermingle .",
    "this dynamic causes global as well as individual cell movement , which is thus the product of the combined actions of growth and division on the one hand , and the non - overlapping constraint on the other hand .",
    "growth is modeled as a continuous phenomenon except at the time of division , which occurs when a cell reaches approximately twice the volume of a newborn daughter cell .",
    "a uniform probability distribution is added to the growth increment over a time - step to introduce some randomness in the cell division starting time . when this process starts the mother cell deforms itself in a dumbbell shaped geometry to give birth to two identical daughter cells .",
    "deformation occurs with total volume kept constant .",
    "the duration of mitosis is short compared to the interphase ( around one over thirty units of time ) .",
    "thus , when a division occurs , the other cells stop growing , i.e. we consider mitosis as an instantaneous phenomenon . during division",
    "an equilibrium between the mechanical adhesion forces and the non - overlapping constraint determines the state of the system at each instant of time . in order to explore the influence of the orientation of the division plane onto the lineage organization",
    ", we consider three different possibilities : divisions occur in _ 1 ) _ a random direction , _ 2 ) _ in the direction of the line joining the origin and the mother cell ( radial direction ) _",
    "3 ) _ in the direction orthogonal to the radial direction ( tangential direction ) . furthermore , in addition to the different division planes , we consider two different strategies . _",
    "1 ) _ free orientation strategy : orientation is chosen at the beginning of the division but is free to change during the deformation into a dumbbell - like shape and finally into two daughter cells .",
    "this change of orientation is only due to the interactions with neighboring agents through the energy minimization procedure which defines the new configurations .",
    "_ 2 ) _ constrained orientation strategy : orientation is chosen at the beginning of the division and remains fixed up to the end of the division process . at each time step , a minimum of this mechanical energy subject to the non - overlapping constraint is computed . at the beginning of the next time step",
    ", cells radii grow and divisions may arise .",
    "this induces a disruption of the mechanical equilibrium and thus a new minimum of the energy is computed .",

    "this work represents a step towards understanding the impact of division parameters on the growth of a cell population via comparison of mathematical models and experiments .",
    "the approach consists of a bottom - up strategy where the behavior of a growing population of cells and the structure of the associated lineages is modeled through simple interaction rules of mechanical type between cells . after observing that these simple rules could not explain the morphology of the cell population alone , we introduced additional phenomena , which , at first were considered negligible .",
    "this process of gradually increasing complexity was repeated until a good fit between experiments and simulations is obtained .",
    "this approach permits to assess which key mechanisms are more likely to be underlying the observed phenomena without introducing too many empirical parameters . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the energy minimization considered here is motivated by the observation that physical principles are often expressed in variational forms .",
    "our results suggest that this variational approach seems also at play here .",
    "our numerical and experimental results show a wide disparity between central and peripheral lineages .",
    "peripheral lineages are more fragmented and slightly tangentially oriented . with the simplest model ,",
    "some differences between simulations and experimental data are found : experiments show that cells in the central region move over larger distances than in the model .",
    "we thus introduced the possibility for cells to switch positions inside the cell population .",
    "we also lowered the aggregation force at the periphery of the cellular aggregate to model weaker aggregation of peripheral cells .",
    "the corresponding numerical results match the experimental data very convincingly .",
    "another interesting experimental observation is that in the central area , a preferred radial direction of the lineages emerges and that a similar feature can be found in the model if a radial division plane orientation is imposed .",
    "the analysis suggests that the disparity between the center and the periphery , found experimentally and verified numerically , could be explained by the simple hypotheses made in the model .",
    "more quantitative work is needed to understand the role of the division orientation on the observed emerging structures and on lineage shape and orientation . in the future ,",
    "larger populations should be considered . on the other hand , considering very small populations permits to ignore the role played by nutrients , growth factors and oxygen , and to consider simple two dimensional settings for both the model and the experiments .",
    "this also made the image processing easier and more reliable avoiding problems related to the tracking of cells in a three dimensional structure and it allowed for the use of cpu - effective agent based model which would be too costly in three dimensions .",
    "however , these simplifying choices lead to a model with restricted validity and questionable applicability to three dimensional structures . to understand",
    "the role of the orientation of the division plane future experiments which track cells during mitosis would permit to further explore the biology of tumor aggregates and provide a better benchmark for the validation of three dimensional models .",
    "another direction of research is to explore the impact of mechanical confinement on cell proliferation .",
    "recent experiments @xcite showed that proliferation gradients within mechanically confined spheroids are different from those in spheroids grown in suspension .",
    "this discovery strengthens the hypothesis of mechanical forces playing a central role in the morphologies of the lineages and requires further studies .",

    "sphericity of the population @xmath159 : * for all different cases tested , the distribution of @xmath159 shows a gaussian profile with mean value approximately around @xmath160 .",
    "these distributions are illustrated in fig .",
    "this result suggests that the tested orientation divisions have a very limited impact on the overall shape of the population , in other words the positioning rule has much stronger impact on the overall shape of the population that the division law .",
    "however , some differences clearly emerge from the results .",
    "in particular we can observe that the differences in sphericity between the three orientation directions are much stronger when the constrained strategy is employed .",
    "this is expected since in the free strategy case the cells have more freedom to adapt to reduce the energy of the system .",
    "in addition , when the tangential direction strategy is used larger sphericity values are obtained than with the radial orientation strategy .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that a cell at the boundary which divides radially generates more irregularity compared to the tangential division .",
    "this irregularity increases the perimeter of the population keeping the area almost fixed .",
    "+    * diagnostic 2 .",
    "convexity of the population @xmath161 : * results are consistent with the ones of the previous diagnostic . whatever the strategy and division direction chosen , the values of @xmath161 are very similar , around a mean value of 0.94 , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . giving a closer look at the results , we see that the differences between the three division orientations are more pronounced when the constrained strategy is employed .",
    "in particular we can state that , if the free strategy is adopted no difference between the three orientations of the division plane is observed . in the constrained case ,",
    "results show larger @xmath161 values for the tangential direction , which can be interpreted by saying that the shape of the boundaries is more regular when the division plane has tangential direction .",

    "this profile is obtained by computing the linear interpolation lines of the cumulative distribution between the ends of these five zones .",
    "on the periphery of the cellular aggregate , there are @xmath173 of small connected components and @xmath174 of large connected components .",
