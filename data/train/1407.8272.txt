    "selected transitions in highly - charged ions ( hci ) were shown to have very large sensitivities to @xmath6-variation owing to high nuclear charge @xmath12 , high ionization state , and differences in the configuration composition of the corresponding states  @xcite . while highly - charged ions have very large ionization energies , some of these systems have transitions that lie in the optical range due to level crossing .",
    "moreover , these ions have very long - lived low - lying metastable states which is a first requirement for the development of a frequency standard .",
    "highly - charged ions are less sensitive to external perturbations than either neutral atoms or singly charged ions due to more compact size of the electronic cloud . as a result , some of the usual systematic clock uncertainties as well as decoherence processes in quantum information applications may be suppressed .",

    "we start with the brief description of the methods used in this work in section  [ method ] .",
    "the results for ag - like and in - like ions are presented in sections  [ ag ] and [ in ] , respectively .",
    "we use two different relativistic high - precision approaches for all of the calculations carried out in this work .",
    "the first approach is the relativistic linearized coupled - cluster method that includes all single , double , and partial triple excitations ( sdpt ) of dirac - fock wave function  @xcite .",
    "it is applicable only to monovalent systems , so we use it for the calculation of properties of ag - like ions and those in - like ions that can be treated as monovalent systems .",
    "sdpt has been extremely successfully in predicting properties of alkali - metal atoms and other monovalent ions @xcite .",
    "the ag - like ions have a single valence electron above the closed @xmath19 core .",
    "it allows us to use relativistic linearized coupled - cluster method that includes all single , double , and partial triple excitations of dirac - fock wave function .",
    "we refer the reader to the review @xcite for detail description of the method and its applications and give only a brief introduction to this approach .",
    "the point of departure in all our calculations is the relativistic no - pair hamiltonian @xmath20 @xcite expressed for the case of _ frozen - core _ @xmath21 dirac - fock potential as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are two - particle matrix elements of the coulomb interaction , @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath37 are single - excitation coefficients for core and valence electrons ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are core and valence double - excitation coefficients , respectively .",
    "the triple excitations @xmath40 are included perturbatively into the energy and single - valence excitation coefficient equations . in the single - double ( sd ) variant of the all - order method , only single and double excitations are included .",
    "the equations for the excitation coefficients @xmath41 and the correlation energy are derived by substituting the state vector @xmath42 into the many - body schrdinger equation @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting system of equations is solved iteratively until the correlation energy converges to required numerical accuracy .",
    "this approach includes dominant many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) terms to all orders because every iteration picks up correlation terms that correspond to the next order of perturbation theory .",

    "pr@xmath3 represents a particularly attractive case where both @xmath65 levels are located between the @xmath66 and @xmath67 fine structure multiplet , making @xmath68 a very long - lived metastable level .",
    "energies of in - like `` monovalent '' cs@xmath17 , ba@xmath18 , ce@xmath2 , pr@xmath3 , and nd@xmath4 ions relative to the ground state are given in table  [ tab - in1-like ] in @xmath56 .",
    "we calculate the energies for all three cs@xmath17 , ba@xmath18 , ce@xmath2 ions where the experimental values are available to understand the trends of the difference with experiment so we can improve the values and reduce the uncertainty of the pr@xmath3 energies .",

    "qed correction is small for transitions with no @xmath69 state , and is omitted .",
    "the contributions of the higher - orders is evaluated as the difference of the ci+all - order and ci+mbpt results .",
    "the breit contribution is calculated as the difference of the results with and without the inclusion of this effect . the contribution of the higher @xmath70 partial waves ( labeled `` extrap '' ) is estimated to be equal to the contribution of the @xmath54 partial wave following our empiric rule obtained for ag - like ions .",

    "the resulting contributions from higher - order coulomb correlation ( difference of the ci+mbpt and ci+all - order calculations ) , estimated contributions of higher partial waves ( above @xmath55 ) , and breit interaction are given separately in columns ho , extrap , and breit of table  [ tab - in1-like ] .",
    "the final theoretical results are listed in `` ci+all '' column .",
    "the experimental results are from @xcite for cs@xmath17 and ba@xmath18 and @xcite for ce@xmath2 .",
    "wavelengths for transitions to the ground state are given in last two columns in nm .",
    "estimated uncertainties of theoretical calculations are given in column `` unc '' .",
    "we use ba@xmath18 reference ion to estimate the uncertainties of the ce@xmath2 calculations using the approaches described in the previous sections .",
    "the uncertainty is estimated as the sum of the following : ( 1 ) difference of the theoretical and experimental energies for the reference ion ( ba@xmath18 ) and ( 2 ) difference in the sum of all four corrections between the reference and the current ion , ce@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting uncertainties for the @xmath64 states are very close to the actual differences with experiment , while the uncertainty of the @xmath63 state is significantly overestimated .",
    "the energies of the @xmath64 levels of pr@xmath3 are very difficult to calculate accurately since these are very close to the ground @xmath66 state .",
    "the one - electron removal energies of the @xmath66 and @xmath68 states are @xmath71  @xmath56 , and these values cancel to 99.7  % when two energies are subtracted to obtain the  _ ab initio _ transition energy of 3432  @xmath56 .",
    "meanwhile , all of the corrections ( ho , breit , and extrap ) are large , 1000 - 3000  @xmath56 and partially cancel each other . studying the trends of the difference between theory and experiment for three previous ions of the sequence",
    "shows that the discrepancy somewhat increases for heavier ions , which probably results from rapid increase of actual removal energies .",
    "therefore , we adjust our _ ab initio _ values 3432  @xmath56 and 6761  @xmath56 for the @xmath68 and @xmath72 states , respectively , by the difference of the ce@xmath2 results with experiment , i.e. 270  @xmath56 .",
    "the change in sum of all three corrections between ce@xmath2 and pr@xmath3 is only 120 - 170  @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we estimate the uncertainty in these energies to be on the order of @xmath73  @xmath56 . the uncertainty in the @xmath67 energy is taken to be 40  @xmath56 based on the accuracy of this energy for ce@xmath2 ion .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients @xmath15 for pr@xmath3 obtained in the lowest - order dirac - fock ( df+breit ) , sdpt , and ci+all - order approximations are given in table  [ tab - pr - q ] in @xmath56 .",
    "the second - column ( df ) shows lowest - order results without the breit interaction .",
    "breit is included in all other calculations .",
    "just as in the case of ag - like ions , the correlation effect on the values of @xmath15 is small , 0.3 - 1.0% .",
    "the breit interaction contributes from -1.3% to -2.7% .",
    "the differences between the coefficients @xmath15 calculated using the ci+all - order and sdpt methods are negligible . the final ci+all - order sensitivity coefficients @xmath15 for `` monovalent '' in - like ce@xmath2 , pr@xmath3 , and nd@xmath4 ions are given in table  [ tab - in - like - q ] together with the corresponding ci+all - order transition energies and @xmath16 enhancement factors .",
    "lowest - order ( @xmath74 ) and all - order ( @xmath75 ) multipole matrix elements @xmath76 and @xmath77 , transition rates @xmath78 ( in s@xmath79 ) , and lifetimes in in - like ions are listed in table  [ tab - mult2 ] .",

    "the low - lying levels of pr@xmath3 ion and our estimates of the radiative lifetimes are shown in fig .",

    "the order of levels changes again for sm@xmath0 , where @xmath80 configuration becomes the closest to the ground @xmath81 fine - structure multiplet .",
    "this leads to a very interesting level structure with a metastable @xmath80 @xmath82 level in the optical transition range to both ground and excited @xmath83 levels of the fine - structure multiplet .",
    "the second level crossing , @xmath84 , leads to further change of the level order for eu@xmath5 , where @xmath80 becomes the ground state and the @xmath59 becomes the first excited level .",
    "we note that these levels are very close and the uncertainty of our calculations is comparable to the energy interval .",
    "therefore , it might be possible that @xmath59 @xmath85 is a ground state configuration .",
    "the previous in - like reference ions , such as ce@xmath2 can not be used to establish the accuracy of the calculations for sm@xmath0 and eu@xmath5 due to completely different set of low - lying configurations .",
    "the 25% of all four corrections added in quadrature is used to estimate uncertainty for all levels of sm@xmath0 and @xmath59 levels of eu@xmath5 . in the case of the @xmath86 fine structure",
    "multiplet energy levels of eu@xmath5 , we take the average of 25% estimate and sum of the all four corrections as an uncertainty .",
    "we note that this is the first time that the ci+all - order method was applied to such complicated configurations as @xmath59 and no benchmark comparisons with experiment exist for such states .",

    "the numbers in brackets represent powers of 10 .",
    "the ci+all - order matrix elements calculated without random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) correction are listed in column labelled @xmath91 .",
    "in such a calculation , `` bare '' @xmath45 and @xmath46 operators are used instead of the effective transition operators ( for example electric - dipole @xmath92 .",
    "while rpa correction is significant for e1 and e2 transitions , it is small for m1 transitions between the levels of the fine - structure multiplet .",
    "we find that the lifetimes of the sm@xmath0 levels are relatively small , less then 1  sec , making it less attractive for our applications of interest .",
    "nevertheless , shorter lifetimes will make locating the transitions easier so this ion may be used as a benchmark for further improvement of the theory .",
    "if measurements are carried out in this ion , it may be possible to use the resulting comparison to further improve the theory for other ions .",
    "the case of eu@xmath5 is similar and does not appear to have all features for the clock development . while uncertainty of our data is large , present results place the first level too close to the ground state to be practically useful .",
    "the next level is of the same configuration as the ground state and has small value of @xmath15 .",
