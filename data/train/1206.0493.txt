    "we stress that the main purpose of this paper is to extend and complete the study of the notion of generalized riesz product associated to the rank one flows on @xmath0 formulated in the same manner as peyrire in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite mentioned that peyrire extended the notion of riesz product to the real line using a class of kernel functions .",
    "furthermore , it is noted by peyrire in his pioneer paper @xcite that an alternative extension of the classical riesz products can be done using the bohr compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it is usual that the extension of some notions from the periodic setting to the almost periodic deals with the bohr compactification @xmath2 of @xmath0 ( or more generally , the bohr compactification of local abelian groups ) .",
    "the bohr compactification plays in the almost periodic case the same role played by the torus @xmath3 in the periodic case as the domain of the fast scale variables .",
    "as opposed to the torus , the bohr compactification is often a non - separable compact topological space and this lack of separability is a source of difficulties in trying to adapt the arguments from the periodic context to the almost periodic one .",

    "established that the bohr compactification of a given locally compact abelian group has a countable basis if and only if the union of the spectrum of all almost periodic functions is countable .",

    "it turns out that the main idea developed in @xcite does not seem well adapted to the context of our extension of generalized riesz products to the bohr compactification of @xmath0 .",

    "for the basic facts about almost periodic functions and generalizations of this concept the reader is referred to the classical presentation of bohr @xcite and besicovitch @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath107 now , translations are strongly continuous on @xmath108 .",
    "indeed , this is a standard consequence of the density of @xmath18 in @xmath109 , which follows from theorem [ gelfand ] , and the invariance of the haar measure .",
    "therefore , the right - hand side is a continuous function of @xmath110 , and so the identity still holds with @xmath111 .",
    "hence we get , using fubini theorem and the invariance of the haar measure , @xmath112 from which it follows that @xmath113 , as asserted .",

    "riesz products were discovered in 1918 by f. riesz @xcite to answer affirmatively a special question in the theory of fourier series , namely , whether there exists a continuous measure whose fourier coefficients do not vanish at infinity .",

    "then the functions @xmath288 , are stochastically independent under the haar measure of the bohr compactification of @xmath0 and converge in distribution to the complex gaussian measure @xmath289 on @xmath290 .    by theorem [ kac - clt ] the functions @xmath288 , are stochastically independent under the haar measure of @xmath2 and it is straightforward to verify that the hypotheses of central limit theorem [ mclt ] are satisfied .",
    "we conclude that the sequence @xmath291 converges in distribution to the complex gaussian measure @xmath289 on @xmath290 .",
    "using the analogous lemma of fjer s lemma @xcite combined with the clt methods introduced in @xcite , we shall give a direct proof of the singularity of a large class of generalized riesz products on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , our strategy is slightly different from the strategy of the proofs given by many authors in the case of the torus @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed , the crucial argument in their proofs is to estimate the following quantity @xmath292 precisely , they showed that the weak limit point of the sequence @xmath293 is bounded below by a positive constant and it is well - known that this implies the singularity of the generalized riesz products ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "+ let us start our proof by proving the following lemma analogous to fjer s lemma @xcite    [ fejer ] with the above notations we have @xmath294    by our assumption the sequence @xmath295 is rationally independent .",
    "hence , by kac theorem [ kac - clt ] , for @xmath296 , the function @xmath226 and @xmath297 are stochastically independent .",

    "the fundamental argument in the proof above is based on lemma [ fejer ] and therefore strongly depended on the assumption that along subsequence the positive real numbers @xmath312 are linearly independent over the rationals .",
    "we argue that in the general case , one may use the methods of bourgain @xcite , klemes - reinhold @xcite , klemes @xcite and el abdalaoui @xcite to establish the singularity of a large class of generalized riesz products on @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the case when @xmath313 is bounded . in the forthcoming paper , we will show how to extend a classical results from the torus and real line setting to the generalized riesz products on the bohr compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "we are concerned here with the flat polynomials issue in @xmath2 .",
    "first , we recall briefly the relevant fact on the flatness problem in the torus @xmath315",
    ". + the problem of flatness go back to littlewood in his 1968 famous paper @xcite . in that paper , littlewood introduce two class of complex polynomials @xmath316 and @xmath317 where @xmath318 is a positive integer .",
    "the class @xmath316 is a class of those polynomials @xmath319 that are _ unimodular _ , that is , @xmath320 , for @xmath321 .",
    "@xmath317 is the subclass of @xmath316 with real coefficients , i.e. , @xmath322 , for @xmath321 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath225 in @xmath317 are nowadays called littlewood polynomials . by parseval s formula @xmath323",
    "therefore , for all @xmath324 , @xmath325 in @xcite littlewood raised the problem of the existence of a sequence @xmath326 of unimodular polynomials such that @xmath327 such sequence of unimodular polynomials are called ultraflat .",
    "precisely , the usual definition of ultraflatness is given as follows    let @xmath328 be a sequence of positive integers and @xmath329 a sequence of positive real numbers tending to @xmath82 , we say that a sequence @xmath330 of unimodular polynomials is @xmath329-ultraflat if @xmath331    the problem of existence of the ultraflat polynomials was solved affirmatively by kahane in his 1980 paper @xcite . precisely , kahane proved that there exists a sequence of @xmath332-ultraflat with @xmath333 but as noted by queffelec and saffari @xcite kahane proof is some kind of miracle .",
    "this is due to the fact that kahane work is inspired by krner paper @xcite and krner paper is based on byrnes paper @xcite .",
    "but , in 1996 j. benedetto and his student hui - chuan wu discovered that theorem 2 in byrnes paper @xcite was erroneous and as a consequence invalidated krner main result .",
    "fortunately kahane proof was independent of theorem 2 in byrnes paper .",
    "+ the problem of the existence of the ultraflat littlewood polynomials is unsettled to this date and as pointed by erdlyi @xcite it is a common belief that there is no ultraflat sequence of littlewood polynomials . as a consequence no long barker sequences exist ( see @xcite and the references given there ) .",
    "+ one more important class of polynomials is the class of polynomials with coefficients @xmath334 called a class of idempotent polynomials for obvious reasons of being convolution idempotents and denoted by @xmath335~~:~~ p(x)=\\sum_{0}^{n-1}a_k x^k , a_k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\},~~n \\in \\n^*.\\ ] ] a subclass of @xmath336 with constant term @xmath123 is called a class of newman polynomials and denoted by @xmath337 .    another extremal open problem in the class of littewood polynomials or in the class of newman polynomials is the problem of @xmath4-flatness . in the same way as the ultraflatness",
    ", the @xmath4-flatness is defined as follows    let @xmath328 be a sequence of positive integers and @xmath329 a sequence of positive real numbers tending to @xmath82 , we say that a sequence @xmath330 of polynomials is @xmath338-flat if @xmath339    the problem of the existence of @xmath4-flat sequence of unimodular polynomials was solved by newman in @xcite .",
    "later , m. guenais inspired by newman work constructed @xcite a sequence of @xmath4-flat littlewood polynomials on @xmath340 where @xmath341 is an increasing sequence of prime numbers . as a consequence she established a existence of countable group action with simple spectrum and haar component",
    "subsequently , el abdalaoui and lemaczyk @xcite proved that the sequence of littlewood polynomials constructed by guenais is ultraflat .",
    "before , j. bourgain in his 1993 paper @xcite conjectured that the supremum of the @xmath4 norm by @xmath342 norm over all idempotent polynomials on the circle must be strictly less than one . precisely , he make the following conjecture    @xcite @xmath343    using the bourgain ideas , m. guenais @xcite connected the problem of the existence of @xmath4-flat sequence of littlewood polynomials or newman polynomials and the banach problem on whether there exist a dynamical system with simple lebesgue spectrum .",
    "ulam in his book @xcite stated the banach problem in the following form    does there exist a square integrable function @xmath344 and a measure preserving transformation @xmath345 , @xmath346 , such that the sequence of functions @xmath347 forms a complete orthogonal set in hilbert space ?",
    "let us formulate the bourgain conjecture in context of bohr compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "for that , let @xmath348 be the subspace of trigonometric polynomials on @xmath0 and @xmath349 be an increasing sequence of real numbers .",
    "put @xmath350    then , we can state the bourgain conjecture in context of bohr compactification of @xmath0 in the following form    for any increasing sequence @xmath349 of real numbers , we have @xmath351 where @xmath352    for the sequence @xmath349 of rationally independent numbers , we are able to prove the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath353 be a sequence of real numbers such that for any @xmath354 , the real numbers @xmath355 are rationally independent .",
    "then , we have @xmath356    since , for any @xmath354 , the real numbers @xmath355 are rationally independent , then we can apply the kac clt theorem [ kac - clt ] .",
    "but , the functions @xmath357 are in @xmath109 we deduce that they are uniformly integrable . hence , by theorem [ chung ] , we conclude that @xmath358 this finish the proof of the proposition .",
    "the discussion above allows us to formulate the following questions    does there exist a sequence of @xmath4-flat littlewood polynomials or of the @xmath4-flat newman polynomials on @xmath2 ?    subsequently    does there exist a the ultraflat littlewood or newman polynomials on @xmath2 ?    [ rem - pri]we remind here that in @xcite , a. a. prikhodko constructed a sequence of trigonometric polynomials @xmath133 which is locally @xmath4-flat , that is , for any @xmath359 and @xmath360 there exists a positive integer @xmath361 such that for any @xmath362 , we have @xmath363 the polynomials @xmath364 are given by @xmath365 where , @xmath366 @xmath367 is a sequence of positive integers with @xmath368 and @xmath369 , @xmath370 is a sequence of rational numbers which goes to @xmath82 as @xmath318 goes to @xmath371 . + but , this sequence is not @xmath4-flat on the bohr compactification of @xmath0 . indeed",
    ", one may show that we have @xmath372 in addition , it is proved in @xcite that this sequence is not @xmath4-flat on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a locally abelian compact group and denoted by @xmath373 its topology .",
    "let @xmath95 be a group of the characters on @xmath29 , that is , the continuous homomorphism from @xmath29 to the torus @xmath374 put @xmath375 the space of all functions from @xmath95 to @xmath315 equipped with the product topology ( i.e. ; the pointwise convergence topology ) .",
    "therefore , there is a canonical injective homomorphism from @xmath29 to @xmath376 given by @xmath377 @xmath30 is called a dual homomorphism . by abuse of notation",
    "we denote by the same letter @xmath29 the image of @xmath29 under @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 is equipped with the bohr topology denoted by @xmath378 and the topology inherited from @xmath29 . hence @xmath379 . by taking the closure of @xmath29 with respect to the bohr topology we get the bohr compactification of @xmath29 and we denoted it by @xmath380 .",
    "thus , by construction , @xmath380 is compact .",
    "+ let us state the following useful lemma .      by the definition of the product topology on @xmath376 , a sequence of functions",
    "@xmath385 converge to some function @xmath10 if and only if , for any @xmath383 , @xmath386 by taking @xmath387 and @xmath388 we get @xmath389 which means that for any @xmath383 , @xmath390 and the proof of the lemma is complete .",
    "we deduce from the lemma the following crucial fact about the separability of the bohr compactification of @xmath29 .",
    "we recall that the topological space is separable if it is contains a countable , dense subset .        in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the lemma [ cvg ] say that the sequence of real numbers @xmath391 converge in the sense of the bohr topology to @xmath110 if and only if , for any @xmath142 , @xmath392 but since the characters on @xmath0 are lipschitz we deduce easy that the bohr topology is contained in the usual topology and @xmath226 is dense in the usual topology and bohr topology .",
    "+ nevertheless , by the hirodata - kakutani theorem , @xmath0 equipped with the bohr topology does nt have a countable basis and it is often that the bohr topology does nt have a countable basis .",
    "precisely , hirodata - kakutani theorem asserts      we recall that the fourier coefficient of @xmath10 on @xmath393 is given by @xmath394 where @xmath36 is the haar measure on @xmath29 and @xmath393 is in the spectrum of @xmath10 if the fourier coefficients of @xmath10 on @xmath31 is not zero           the author wishes to express his gratitude to m. lemaczyk , j - p .",
