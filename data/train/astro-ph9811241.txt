    "we are measuring the peculiar motions of galaxy clusters in the hercules - corona borealis ( hcb ) and perseus - pisces - cetus ( ppc ) regions at distances between 6000 and 15000  using the global properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this study ( the efar project ) has as primary goals : ( i )  characterising the intrinsic properties of elliptical galaxies in clusters by compiling a large and homogeneous sample with high - quality photometric and spectroscopic data ; ( ii )  testing possible systematic errors , such as environmental dependence , in existing elliptical galaxy distance estimators ; ( iii )  deriving improved distance estimators based on a more comprehensive understanding of the properties of ellipticals and how these are affected by the cluster environment ; and ( iv )  determining the peculiar velocity field in regions that are dynamically independent of the mass distribution within 5000  of our galaxy in order to test whether the large - amplitude coherent flows seen locally are typical of bulk motions in the universe .",
    "the background and motivation of this work are discussed in paper  i of this series ( wegner  1996 ) , which also describes in detail the choice of regions to study , the sample of clusters and groups , and the selection procedure and selection functions of the programme galaxies . in earlier papers we reported the photoelectric photometry for 352 programme galaxies which underpins the transformation of our ccd data to the standard @xmath4 magnitude system ( colless  1993 ) , and described our technique for correcting for the effects of seeing on our estimates of length scales and surface brightnesses ( saglia  1993 ) .",
    "this paper ( paper  ii ) describes the spectroscopic observations and gives redshifts , velocity dispersions and linestrength indices for the programme galaxies . the ccd imaging observations of these galaxies , and their photometric parameters , are described in paper  iii ( saglia 1997 ) , while descriptions of the profile fitting techniques used to determine these parameters ( along with detailed simulations establishing the uncertainties and characterising the systematic errors ) are given in paper  iv ( saglia  1997 ) .",
    "the  relation and its implications are discussed in paper  v ( colless  1998 ) .",
    "subsequent papers in the series will explore other intrinsic properties of the galaxies and their dependence on environment , derive an optimal distance estimator , and discuss the peculiar motions of the clusters in each of our survey regions and their significance for models of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in  [ sec : obsvns ] we describe the observations and reductions used in obtaining the 1319 spectra in our dataset ( 1250 spectra for 666 programme galaxies and 69 spectra for 48 calibration galaxies ) and discuss the quality of the data .",
    "we explain the techniques by which redshifts , velocity dispersions and linestrength indices were estimated from the spectra in  [ sec : analysis ] , including the various corrections applied to the raw values . in  [ sec : results ] we describe the method used to combine data from different runs and evaluate the internal precision of our results using the large number of repeat measurements in our dataset .",
    "we then give the final values of the spectroscopic parameters for each galaxy in our sample : we have redshifts for 706 galaxies , dispersions and  linestrengths for 676 galaxies and linestrengths for 582 galaxies .",
    "we compare our results to previous studies in the literature to obtain external estimates of our random and systematic errors . in ",
    "[ sec : clusass ] we combine our redshifts with those from zcat in order to assign sample galaxies to physical clusters , and to estimate the mean redshifts and velocity dispersions of these clusters .",

    "this paper presents the largest and most homogeneous sample of velocity dispersions and linestrengths for elliptical galaxies ever obtained .",
    "the precision of our measurements is sufficiently good to achieve the goal of measuring distances via the fundamental plane out to 15000 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations for the efar project were obtained over a period of seven years from 1986 to 1993 in a total of 33 observing runs on 10 different telescopes . in this section",
    "we describe the spectroscopic setups , the observing procedures , the quality of the spectra and the data - reduction techniques",
    ". further detail on these points is given by baggley ( 1996 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : obsruns ] gives the spectroscopic setup for each run , including the run number , date , telescope , spectrograph and detector , wavelength range , spectral dispersion ( in  / pixel ) , effective resolution ( in ) , and the effective aperture size .",
    "note that two runs ( 116 and 130 ) produced no useful data and are included in table  [ tab : obsruns ] only for completeness .",
    "three runs utilised fibre spectrographs : runs 127 and 133 used argus on the ctio 4 m and run 131 used mefos on the eso 3.6 m .",
    "all the other runs employed longslit spectrographs , mostly on 2m - class telescopes ( mdm hiltner 2.4 m , isaac newton 2.5 m , kitt peak 2.1 m , siding spring 2.3 m , calar alto 2.2 m ) although some 4m - class telescopes were also used ( kitt peak 4 m , william herschel 4 m , the mmt ) .",

    "the galaxies for which we measured velocity dispersions are only a subset of our sample of programme galaxies ( 629/743 ) , and represent a refinement of the sample selection criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : dwsig ] shows the fraction of programme galaxies with measured dispersions as a function of the galaxy diameter @xmath5 on which the selection function of the programme galaxy sample is defined .",
    "there is a steady decline in the fraction of the sample for which usable dispersions were measured , from 100% for the largest galaxies",
    "( with @xmath6  arcsec ) to about 75% for the smallest ( with 8  arcsec  @xmath7  15  arcsec ; there are only 3 programme galaxies with @xmath8  8  arcsec ) .",
    "this additional selection effect must be allowed for when determining fundamental plane distances .",
    "=    =      one of the strengths of our spectroscopic sample is the high fraction of objects with repeat observations : there are 375 galaxies with a single dispersion measurement , 160 with two measurements and 141 with three or more measurements",
    ". figure  [ fig : errdist3 ] shows the cumulative distributions of rms errors in redshift , dispersion , and  obtained from these repeat observations .",
    "the detailed internal comparisons made possible by these repeat measurements have been used to establish the run corrections (  [ ssec : combruns ] ) and to calibrate the estimated errors (  [ ssec : caliberr ] ) .",
    "the latter process ensured that the estimated errors were statistically consistent with the rms errors of the repeat measurements .",
    "=    we also make external comparisons of our measurements with the work of other authors .",
    "the efar redshifts are compared in figure  [ fig : compcz ] with redshifts given in the literature by the 7  samurai ( davies  1987 ) , dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) , beers  ( 1991 ) , malumuth  ( 1992 ) , zabludoff  ( 1993 ) , colless & dunn ( 1996 ) and lucey  ( 1997 ) .",
    "only 11 of the 256 comparisons give redshift differences greater than 300 : in 6 cases the efar redshift is confirmed either by repeat measurements or other published measurements ; in the remaining 5 cases the identification of the galaxy in question is uncertain in the literature .",
    "for the 245 cases where the redshift difference is less than 300 , there is no significant velocity zeropoint error and the rms scatter is 85 .",
    "since our repeat measurements show much smaller errors ( 90% are less than 36 ) , most of this scatter must arise in the literature data , some of which were taken at lower resolution or @xmath9 than our data .",
    "=    figure  [ fig : compsig ] compares the efar dispersions with published dispersions from the work of the 7  samurai ( davies  1987 ) , guzmn ( 1993 ) , jrgensen  ( 1995 ) and lucey  ( 1997 ) , and the compilation of earlier measurements by whitmore  ( 1985 ) .",
    "note that we do not compare to the more recent compilation by mcelroy ( 1995 ) , since its overlap with our sample is essentially just the sum of above sources .",
    "the mean differences , @xmath10 , and their standard errors are indicated on the figure ; none of these scale differences is larger than 6% and in fact all five comparisons are consistent with zero scale error at the 2@xmath11 level or better .",
    "the rms scatter in these comparisons is significantly greater than the errors in our dispersion measurements , implying that in general the literature measurements have larger errors and/or that there are unaccounted - for uncertainties in the comparison .",
    "=    we determine the zeropoint calibration of our linestrength measurements with respect to the lick system ( see  [ ssec : indices ] ) by comparing our  and  linestrengths to measurements for the same galaxies given by trager  ( 1998 ) .",
    "we find that slightly different calibrations are needed for objects with different redshifts , the result of slight variations in the non - linear continuum shape as the spectra are redshifted with respect to the instrument response and the sky background ( see  [ ssec : indices ] ) .",
    "good agreement with trager is obtained if we use different zeropoints for galaxies with redshifts above and below @xmath12=3000  ( although there are no objects in the comparison at @xmath12@xmath1310000 ) . excluding a few outliers",
    ", we find weighted mean differences between the efar and trager linestrengths of @xmath14=@xmath15  mag and @xmath16=@xmath17  mag for @xmath12@xmath183000 , and @xmath14=@xmath19  mag and @xmath16=@xmath20  mag for @xmath12@xmath133000 .",
    "subtracting these zeropoint corrections gives the final , fully - corrected , linestrength measurements as listed in tables  [ tab : spectab ] &  [ tab : galtab ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : mgbcomp ] &  [ fig : mg2comp ] show the residual differences between the efar and trager  linestrength measurements after applying these zeropoint corrections .",
    "the rms scatter is 0.019  mag in  for the 41 objects in common , and 0.023  mag in  for the 24 objects in common .",
    "there is no statistically significant trend with linestrength , velocity dispersion or redshift remaining in the residuals after these zeropoint corrections are applied .",

    "the overall agreement for the 36 objects in common is very good , with a statistically non - significant zeropoint offset and an rms scatter of 0.029  mag , similar to that found in the comparison with trager    =    =    the relation between the measured  and  linestrengths for all the galaxies in the efar sample is shown in figure  [ fig : mgbmg2 ] .",
    "we fit this relation using a maximum likelihood technique which accounts for both measurement errors and selection effects ( saglia  1998 , in preparation ; paper  vi ) .",
    "we find @xmath21 with a perpendicular rms residual of 0.019  mag ( corresponding to an rms of 0.041  mag in , or 0.021  mag in ) .",
    "the relation is the same if we fit ellipticals , e / s0s , cds or spirals separately .",
    "this relation is similar to those derived by burstein  ( 1984 ) and jrgensen ( 1997 ) .",
    "we can therefore use  as a predictor of  ( albeit with larger uncertainties ) for those cases where  can not be measured directly .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : mgbmg2 ] is the predicted relation between  and  as a function of age and metallicity given by worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "his models correctly predict the slope of the relation , but are offset by @xmath22  mag in ( or by @xmath23  mag in ) , indicating a difference in the model s zeropoint calibration for one or both indices .",
    "the correct assignment of galaxies to clusters ( or groups ) is crucial to obtaining reliable redshifts and distances for the efar cluster sample .",
    "we also need to increase the precision of the cluster redshifts in order to minimise uncertainties in the clusters peculiar velocities . to achieve these goals we merged the efar redshifts with redshifts for all galaxies in zcat ( huchra , 1992 ; version of 1997 may 29 ) which lie within 3  ( 2 abell radii ) of each nominal efar cluster centre ( see table  1 of paper  i ) .",
    "we then examined the redshift distributions of the combined sample in order to distinguish groups , clusters and field galaxies along the line of sight to a nominal efar ` cluster ' .",
    "we also considered the distribution of galaxies on the sky before assigning the efar galaxies to specific groupings .",

    "each efar galaxy was assigned to one of these groupings and given a cluster assignment number ( can ) , listed in table  [ tab : galtab ] .",
    "the main grouping along the line of sight has a can which is simply the original two - digit cid ; other groupings have cans with a distinguishing third leading digit .",
    "the groupings ( which we will hereafter call clusters regardless of their size ) are labelled by their cans in figure  [ fig : cluz ] , which also shows the boundaries of each cluster in redshift space .",
    "the last two digits of each galaxy s can is its cid , apart from 41 galaxies which were reassigned to other neighbouring clusters : two galaxies in cid=33 were reassigned to can=34 ( gins 254 , 255 ) ; two galaxies in cid=34 were reassigned to can=33 ( gins 263 , 264 ) ; five galaxies in cid=35 were reassigned to can=36 ( gins 270 , 274 , 275 , 281 , 282 ) ; fourteen galaxies in cid=36 were reassigned to can=35 ( gins 285292 , 295297 , 299301 ) , one galaxy in cid=47 was reassigned to can=50 ( gin 406 ) ; three galaxies in cid=59 and two in cid=61 were reassigned to can=53 ( gins 514 , 517 , 527 , 536 , 537 ) ; five galaxies with cid=69 were reassigned to can=70 ( gins 617 , 618 , 619 , 622 , 623 ) ; and all seven galaxies with cid=81 were reassigned to can=80 ( gins 709715 ) .",

    "these quantities are computed both from the efar sample and from the efar+zcat sample . in many of the clusters the efar sample",
    "is greatly supplemented by the zcat galaxies , leading to much - improved estimates of the mean cluster redshift : using efar galaxies only the median uncertainty in the mean cluster redshift ( for clusters with more than one member ) is 177 ; with efar+zcat galaxies the median uncertainty is reduced to 133 .",

    "although obtained in 33 observing runs spanning seven years and 10 different telescopes , we have applied uniform procedures to derive the spectroscopic parameters and brought all the measurements of each parameter onto a standard system which we ensure is internally consistent through comparisons of the large numbers of repeat measurements , and externally consistent through comparisons with published data .",
    "we have performed detailed simulations to estimate measurement errors and calibrated these error estimates using the repeat observations .",
    "the fully - corrected measurements of each parameter from the individual spectra are given in table  [ tab : spectab ] ; the final parameters for 706 galaxies , computed as the appropriately - weighted means of the individual measurements , are listed in table  [ tab : galtab ] .",
    "the median estimated errors in the combined measurements ( including measurement errors and run correction uncertainties ) are @xmath0=20 , @xmath1=9.1% ( @xmath26=0.040  dex ) , @xmath2=7.2% ( @xmath27=0.013  mag ) and @xmath3=0.015  mag .",
    "comparisons with redshifts and dispersions from the literature show no systematic errors .",
    "the linestrengths required only small zeropoint corrections to bring them onto the lick system .",
    "we have assigned galaxies to physical clusters ( as opposed to apparent projected clusters ) by examining the line - of - sight velocity distributions based on efar and zcat redshifts , together with the projected distributions on the sky .",
    "we derive mean redshifts for these physical clusters , which will be used in estimating distances and peculiar velocities , and also velocity dispersions , which will be used to test for trends in the galaxy population with cluster mass or local environment .",
    "the results presented here comprise the largest single set of velocity dispersions and linestrengths for early - type galaxies published to date .",
