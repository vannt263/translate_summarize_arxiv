    "during the past decade the growing interest to the process of lepton pair production in the strong coulomb fields appeared .",
    "this is connected mainly with beginning of operation the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic ( lorentz factor @xmath6 ) and the new collider lhc ( @xmath7 ) which will operate in the nearest future . at such energies",
    "the lepton pairs yield becomes huge ( remind that the total cross section of the process @xmath8 grows with energy as the third power of the logarithm @xcite ) , so that a detail analysis of this process , with taking into account the coulomb corrections ( cc ) is required . such work has been done during last years and a lot of papers are devoted to this subject .",
    "nevertheless the problem turn out to be more complex than it seems from the first glance . for a review of the works in this direction see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "we want only to notice the exciting result obtained in the series of papers @xcite : the coulomb corrections to the process @xmath9 enters the amplitude of this process in such a way that its cross section is determined solely by lowest ( born ) term . at present",
    "we understand that this result is the incorrect application of crossing symmetry property which , as it is known long ago ( see e.g. @xcite ) , is valid only on the born level . as an obvious example of the crossing symmetry violation we want to cite the process of lepton pair photoproduction on the nuclei and its counterpart the bremsstrahlung in lepton  nucleus scattering .",
    "amplitudes of both processes are determined by coulomb phase which is infrared stable in the case of pair photoproduction while it is infrared divergent in the case of bremsstrahlung and this difference ca nt be adjust by trivial crossing change of variables .",
    "nevertheless taking into account the importance of the problem and permanent interest to it from scientific society we calculate the full amplitude for the process @xmath10 accounting all possible photon exchanges among the colliding relativistic particles . from its comparison with the amplitude of the process",
    "@xmath11 one can see that the crossing symmetry property becomes invalid whereas one takes into account the final state interaction .",
    "let us construct the amplitude of the process @xmath0 represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a , b ) @xmath12 we consider the kinematics when all the energy invariants which determined the process ( [ eq:1 ] ) are large , compared with the masses of involved particles and the transferred momenta @xmath13     ( a , b ) and the process @xmath14 ( c , d ) . ]     with three photon exchange . ]    for the born amplitude of the process ( [ eq:1 ] ) one can write @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the charge numbers of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we use sudakov s parameterization for all four  momenta entering the problem ( for details see @xcite ) @xmath17 and the gribov s decomposition of the metric tensor in the longitudinal and transverse parts @xmath18 with light  like 4-vectors @xmath19 . for the kinematics of the process we have @xmath20 where we use two  dimensional vectors in the plane transverse to the z - axes , which we choose along 3vector @xmath21 in the center of mass frame of initial particles @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 . using the gauge invariance conditions",
    "@xmath24 we get the born amplitude in the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 the values of @xmath27 for every polarization state of initial particles ( or for spinless particles ) are unity and @xmath28u(p_3 ) .",

    "let us consider the set of six feynman diagrams ( fd ) with one virtual photon connected the @xmath29 line with the particle @xmath22 and the two ones connected @xmath29 line with the particle @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the loop momentum integration in the relevant matrix element can be performed accounting that @xmath30    it can be shown that only 4 fd amplitudes works ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ( a  d ) ) . really , when one performs the @xmath31 integration in fig .  [ fig:2 ]",
    "( e , f ) , one has a situation when both poles in @xmath31 complex plane are situated in the same half  plane , so their contribution to the amplitude is zero ( suppressed by factor @xmath32 ) .",
    "the physical reason of this suppression is the same as in the case of bremsstrahlung suppression for fast charged particle moving through the media known as the landau ",
    "pomeranchuk effect .",
    "really , this effect can be explained starting from the fact of power suppression of radiation between two scattering centers in the case when the distance between these centers is less than the coherent length .",
    "it is convenient to introduce 8 fd ( including remaining four ones and additional four fd with interchanged photons absorbed by nucleus @xmath23 line ) . to avoid the double counting we multiply the relevant matrix element by statistical factor @xmath33",
    "this trick permits to perform the integration over sudakov variables @xmath31 , @xmath34 with the result @xmath35 further integration over transverse momentum is straightforward @xmath36    . ]    for the amplitude @xmath37 ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] ) and the similar amplitude @xmath38 we obtained @xmath39.\\]]the amplitude for arbitrary amount of interchanged photons ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) is constructed in the similar way @xmath40with the coulomb phases @xmath41    consider now the case with one additional exchanged photon between two nuclei @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the relevant matrix element @xmath42 reads @xmath43 two  dimensional integral in ( [ eq:15 ] ) is infrared divergent . to regularize it we introduce the photon mass parameter @xmath44 .    in the same approach",
    "we get for the matrix element with the @xmath45 exchanged ( between nuclei ) photons ( see fig .  [ fig:5 ] ( a ) ) @xmath46 it is convenient to write down this expression in impact parameter representation . for this aim",
    "we use the following identity @xmath47 thus the matrix element with arbitrary number of exchanged photons can be cast @xmath48with @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51     photon exchange between nuclei @xmath22 and @xmath23 compared with the born diagram for the processes @xmath52 ( a ) and @xmath53 ( b ) ( blob in ( b ) correspond to diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( c , d ) ) . ]",
    "this result confirms the general ansatz given above ( see ( [ eq:14 ] ) ) that all the dependence on `` photon mass '' @xmath44 can be represented as a phase factor .",
    "as can be seen the whole amplitude ( [ eq:18 ] ) can not be cast solely as a born amplitude multiplied by the phase factor .",
    "the corresponding contributions to the total cross section ( except the born term ) will be enhanced only by the first power of logarithm in energy .    finally , taking into account all photon exchanges between particle @xmath54 and nuclei @xmath22 , @xmath23 we obtain the general answer by the simple replacement in the expression ( [ eq:20 ] ) @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 given in ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , our goal is to investigate the crossing symmetry property between the amplitudes of the process ( [ eq:1 ] ) and the relevant process in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ( c , d ) @xmath58 with the following kinematics @xmath59    using the sudakov technique the born amplitude for the process ( 22 ) can be represented in the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "generalization for the case of arbitrary number of exchanged photons between colliding nuclei is straightforward .",
    "the same approach as above leads to the following form of the generalized amplitude @xmath62 with @xmath63    comparing the expression ( [ eq:25 ] ) with the amplitude for the process @xmath52 ( [ eq:18 ] ) one can see that the crossing symmetry property between the considered processes takes place in the case when one neglects the multiple exchanges of particle @xmath54 with nuclei . moreover , this statement is correct even when one takes into account the screening effects between nuclei @xmath22 and @xmath23 in both processes , which manifest itself by insertion of light  by ",
    "light scattering blocks into feynman amplitudes . as was shown in @xcite accounting of this effect can be provided by the universal factor @xmath64 with the complex quantity @xmath65 connected with the fourier transformation of light  by  light scattering amplitude and @xmath66 , @xmath67 the lorentz factors of colliding nuclei .    nevertheless , crossing symmetry",
    "is broken in all orders of perturbation theory if one try to compare the full amplitude for the process @xmath0 ( expression ( 24 ) with the replacement ( 21 ) ) and the relevant amplitude for the process @xmath11 accounting the multiple interaction of produced particles @xcite .",
    "thus the crossing symmetry property takes place only for the colliding nuclei with charge numbers fulfilled the approximation @xmath68 .",
