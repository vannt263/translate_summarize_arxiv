    "the existence of the top quark has been established recently at the fermilab tevatron by the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite with a measured mass near 175 gev . because the top quark is heavier than all other observed fermions and gauge bosons and has a mass of the order of the fermi scale , it couples to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector strongly . in its simplest incarnation , the symmetry breaking sector of the standard model ( sm ) results from the presence of a complex fundamental higgs scalar in the theory . however , there are theoretical arguments of `` triviality '' @xcite and `` naturalness '' @xcite which mitigate against having such a simple scalar sector .",
    "one therefore believes that the higgs sector of the standard model is just an effective theory , and expects that new physics phenomena will manifest themselves significantly through effective interactions of the top quark @xcite .",
    "if anomalous top - quark couplings beyond the sm were to exist , they would affect top - quark production and decay processes at hadron and @xmath2 colliders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such couplings would also affect some quantities measured with high precision , such as the partial width of @xmath3 .",
    "the experimentally observed value at lep - i for the partial width ratio @xmath4 is somewhat higher than the standard model expectation @xcite .",
    "this could be the result of a statistical fluctuation , or it could also be an indication of new physics .    in this paper , we will study the experimental constraints on an anomalous top - quark coupling @xmath0@xcite and discuss in detail the experimental observability of the induced rare decay mode @xmath5 @xcite , both at the fermilab tevatron and the lhc .",
    "there are two major motivations for such a study .",
    "first of all , it is argued @xcite that , in a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scheme , the coupling parameters , @xmath6 , which typify the anomalous couplings of the @xmath7 boson to fermions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , may behave like , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the mass of the fermion @xmath8 , and @xmath12 the vacuum expectation value @xmath13 gev .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the bounds on the @xmath14 for the light quarks @xcite and may give significant effects for the heavy top - quark sector .",
    "representative models in which the above enhancement may be realized include those with new dynamical interactions of the top quarks @xcite , with multi - higgs doublets @xcite , and with new exotic fermions @xcite .",
    "secondly , the decay @xmath5 is rather unique .",
    "it has a very distinct experimental signature , especially if we look for the clean final state from @xmath15 at hadron colliders .",
    "moreover , what makes this study very important is that the expected value of the branching fraction br@xmath16 in the sm is extremely small , being of an order of 10@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , the observation of such a top - quark decay mode would signal the existence of new physics . as we shall see , the fermilab tevatron with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath18 and the lhc with 100 fb@xmath18 will have good potential to explore this anomalous @xmath0 vertex .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we examine the current low energy constraints on the anomalous @xmath0 coupling . in section iii , we study the possibility of testing this anomalous coupling at the fermilab tevatron and the lhc .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for @xmath1 decay are presented in an appendix .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce an effective lagrangian involving the anomalous top - quark couplings , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard model lagrangian and @xmath22 includes all of the anomalous top - quark couplings . for the purpose of this paper , we consider only the anomalous couplings associated with the @xmath23 vertex , and only the operators of lowest dimension that contribute . then @xmath24 + { \\it h.c . } \\ , \\label{leff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the coupling constant of @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the weinberg mixing angle and @xmath28 are free parameters determining the strength of these anomalous couplings . assuming @xmath29-invariance , @xmath28 are real .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath30 of eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) is written in the unitary gauge with a non - linear realization of @xmath31 .",
    "the details of the fermion transformation rule and the procedure for constructing the invariant effective lagrangian under the nonlinear @xmath31 group has been given in @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that because @xmath31 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath32 , the anomalous @xmath33 couplings , as well as those of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , can exist in dimension four , in contrast to the anomalous couplings of a photon ( or a gluon ) to @xmath36 or @xmath37 which require the presence of the gauge field strengths @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .      the anomalous coupling @xmath41 in eq . ( [ leff ] ) is constrained by experimental upper bounds on the induced flavor - changing neutral couplings of the light fermions . integrating the heavy top quark out of @xmath42 generates an effective interaction of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 . evaluating the one - loop diagram for the vertex correction",
    "gives @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and @xmath47 is a cutoff for the effective lagrangian .",
    "the effective lagrangian in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is not renormalizable in the common sense . in our calculation we use dimensional regularization to regularize the divergent loop integration @xcite .",
    "practically , we have also focused only on certain  log - enhanced \" terms by replacing @xmath48 by @xmath49 in the final results .",
    "note that although we perform the calculation in the unitary gauge , it can be shown easily that our results for @xmath50 are gauge - independent . to get a more stringent upper limit on @xmath40 , we take the maximal values of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 matrix elements from the particle data book @xcite .",
    "further we use the upper bounds on @xmath50 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by studying several flavor - changing processes , such as @xmath53 , the @xmath54 mass difference , @xmath55 mixing and @xmath56 , reproduced below    @xmath57 taking @xmath581 tev and @xmath59 175 gev , this gives an upper limit @xmath60 this upper bound on @xmath40 is more stringent than what can be derived from the experimental measurement of the partial width of @xmath61 at lep - i .",
    "that is , @xmath40 would have to be bigger than @xmath62 to account for the discrepancy with the sm expectations .",
    "the bound obtained above using eq .",
    "( [ aij ] ) depends on @xmath47 , so it only gives an order of magnitude upper limit estimate on @xmath41 .",
    "obviously these bounds are not a substitute for direct measurements . however , perhaps surprisingly these experimental bounds are close to the theoretical values inferred for the anomalous @xmath33 couplings using eq .",
    "( 1 ) .      for massless external fermions , @xmath63 will not contribute to @xmath64 . however , both @xmath63 and @xmath65 contribute to the oblique corrections measured experimentaly at lep - i and the slc .",
    "consider the vacuum polarization tensor @xcite @xmath66 .",
    "the presence of @xmath28 will generate a term like @xmath67 such a contribution will affect quantities like the @xmath68 and @xmath69 parameters .",
    "the strongest constraint on @xmath63 comes from the @xmath68 parameter .",
    "using the recent determination of the change of @xmath68 from unity , @xmath70 @xcite , one obtains a @xmath71-limit , @xmath72 in view of the bound on @xmath65 of eq .",
    "( [ kllimit ] ) , this gives a limit @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath69 parameter does not improve on this upper bound for @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath76 .",
    "this correction is safely within the present experimental limit @xcite for @xmath77 .",
    "we conclude this section by summarizing the current upper bounds on @xmath65 and @xmath63 : @xmath78",
    "at the fermilab tevatron , the cross section for @xmath79 production is about 5 pb with @xmath80 tev @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that a comprehensive study of top - quark physics will be carried out with the main injector ( an integrated luminosity about 1 fb@xmath18/yr expected ) , or an upgraded tevatron ( about 10 fb@xmath18/yr ) .",
    "the top quarks will be more copiously produced at the lhc due to a much larger center of mass energy ( 14 tev ) and higher luminosity ( 100 fb@xmath18/yr ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the feasibility of testing the anomalous @xmath0 couplings at these hadron colliders .      to a good approximation",
    ", we can safely ignore the masses of @xmath82 and @xmath83 quarks compared to @xmath84 .",
    "the decay @xmath1 @xcite is similar to that of @xmath85 , up to the new couplings and a kinematical correction factor .",
    "we can thus calculate the branching fraction for @xmath1 by the following simple formula , @xmath86 figure  [ br ] shows this branching fraction plotted versus @xmath87 for @xmath88160 and 200 gev . from the figure we see that the resulting branching fraction is rather insensitive to the precise value of the top - quark mass , so we will take @xmath88175 gev throughout the paper .",
    "the @xmath5 branching fraction is of order 0.1% for @xmath89 , and of order 1% for @xmath90 .",
    "the helicity amplitudes for the decay @xmath5 are presented in an appendix .",
    "one sees that a heavy top - quark decays more significantly to a longitudinally polarized vector boson . keeping only these terms",
    ", the charm - jet angular distribution from a left - handed ( right - handed ) top - quark decay goes approximately like @xmath91.\\ ] ] here the top - quark polarization and the charm - jet polar angle @xmath92 are defined in the top - quark rest frame with respect to the direction of its motion .",
    "one could imagine trying to explore the underlying couplings @xmath28 by studying the angular distributions of the decay products from polarized top quarks .",
    "unfortunately , the dominant mechanisms for top - quark production at hadron colliders via @xmath93 and @xmath94 annihilation give little polarization .",
    "this makes the detailed study of these angular distributions impossible . to pursue this further",
    ", one will have to study other production mechanisms with larger top - quark polarization , such as single - top production @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will ignore top - quark polarization effects altogether .      to obtain the signal event rates , we calculate the top - quark production via @xmath95 with lowest order matrix elements , but normalize the total cross sections to values which include higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "we have used the recent parton distribution functions mrs set - a @xcite .",
    "due to the enormous qcd backgrounds at hadron colliders , it is very difficulty , if not impossible , to search for the signal via the hadronic @xmath96 decay channels , such as @xmath97-jets @xcite or @xmath98-jets @xcite .",
    "for our analysis , we therefore will mainly concentrate on the pure leptonic decays of @xmath99 and @xmath7 , namely : @xmath100 and @xmath101 , calculated with exact decay matrix elements for on - shell @xmath96 .",
    "we have ignored the spin correlations for the decaying top quarks , as discussed above , due to rather insignificant top - quark polarization @xcite for the production mechanisms considered here .",
    "figure [ xsectn ] presents the calculated total cross sections , plotted versus the anomalous coupling @xmath102 , for the process @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath9 denotes a jet from a @xmath83 or @xmath82 quark .",
    "we see that for @xmath102 in the range of interest , the signal cross section at the tevatron is rather small , of the order of a few fb , while at lhc energies , it is about two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "however , the final state of the events is quite distinct : three isolated charged leptons , two of which reconstruct a @xmath7 , large missing transverse energy ( @xmath105 ) , and two hard jets coming from the @xmath83 or @xmath82 quarks .",
    "the only irreducible background to this signal is the electroweak process @xmath106 .",
    "since the signal events naturally contain two energetic jets from heavy top - quark decays , typically with a transverse momentum of order @xmath107 , it is advantageous to demand two observable jets in the events to suppress the @xmath108 background .    to better address the feasibility of observing the effects from @xmath102",
    ", we need to consider detector effects and to impose some acceptance cuts on the transverse momentum @xmath109 , pseudo - rapidity @xmath110 , and the separation in azimuthal angle - pseudo rapidity plane @xmath111 for the charged leptons and jets .",
    "we choose for the tevatron the acceptance cuts : @xmath112 for the lhc the equivalent cuts chosen are : @xmath113 with these minimal acceptance cuts , the signal and background rates at the tevatron and lhc are given in fig",
    ".  [ rate ] ( dotted curves ) .",
    "there is an easy way to improve the signal - to - background ratio to some extent .",
    "recall the argument given above that the jet @xmath114 spectrum for the signal peaks around @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast , the qcd jets in the background events are near the threshold region ( determined by the cutoff imposed ) and extend further , if phase space is available as it is at lhc energies .",
    "this feature is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ptjj ] , where the differential cross section versus a scalar sum of the jet s transverse momenta , @xmath116 is plotted , where the anomalous coupling @xmath117 has been chosen to be 0.14 , for which the signal and the background have about the same total rate .",
    "we see indeed , that the @xmath118 spectrum for the signal peaks near @xmath84 and does not significantly depend on the c.m . energy .",
    "if we further impose a cut on @xmath118 , @xmath119 the background is reduced , but the signal is hardly affected .",
    "the effect of this cut is shown in fig .",
    "[ rate ] by the dashed curves .",
    "an important advantage of searching for top - quark flavor - changing decays in the @xmath120 channel is the full reconstructability of the top - quark mass .",
    "the mass variable @xmath121 from the decay @xmath122 should reconstruct @xmath84 , and is clearly the most characteristic quantity for the signal . similarly , the mass variable @xmath123 from the decay @xmath124 should also peak near @xmath84",
    "however , in the latter case there is a two - fold ambiguity in constructing the neutrino momentum along the beam direction @xcite due to the lack of knowledge of the parton c.m . frame .",
    "for an input @xmath125 and massless leptons , using the measured charged lepton momentum ( @xmath126 ) and the _ transverse _ momentum of the neutrino ( @xmath127 ) , the two solutions for the _ longitudinal _ momentum of the neutrino are given by @xmath128^{1/2 } \\biggr\\ } \\>. \\label{plnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the intrinsic top - quark width is only about 1.5 gev for @xmath129 gev , the signal peaks for these mass variables will not be as narrow and sharp , due to the finite detector resolution for measuring the energy of the charged leptons and hadrons .",
    "we simulate these detector effects by assuming a gaussian energy smearing for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry as follows : @xmath130 moreover , in constructing @xmath131 , because we can not straightforwardly identify the @xmath82-quark jet , we examine both jets in the final state and keep the one of the two mass values which is numerically closer to @xmath129 gev .",
    "figure [ mllj ] shows the differential cross section for the reconstructed mass variable @xmath121 obtained by this procedure for the signal ( solid histogram ) and background ( dashed histogram ) at the tevatron a ) and the lhc b ) .",
    "we see that the signal has a sharp distribution near @xmath84 with a width of about 20 gev , dominated by the hadronic calorimeter resolution of eq .",
    "( [ smear ] ) . in this figure ,",
    "the anomalous coupling @xmath117 has been chosen to be 0.1 , a value for which the signal and the background have about the same total rate .",
    "one can further study the mass variable @xmath132 . here",
    "we once again make use of the knowledge of the value of @xmath84 and choose from the two @xmath123 values the one which is numerically closer to @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ mlnuj ] presents the differential cross section for the variable @xmath133 for the signal ( solid histogram ) and background ( dashed histogram ) for the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we see again a sharp distribution near @xmath84 with a width now about 30 gev .    making use of the distributions of figs .",
    "[ mllj ] and [ mlnuj ] , which are rather impressive , allows us to estimate the statistical sensitivity with which one can hope to measure @xmath102 .",

    "poisson statistics has been adopted in determining the confidence level when the number of events is small . for a large number of events , a 95% ( 99% ) c.l . in this scheme",

    ", we find the sensitivity to be , at the tevatron @xmath136 and at the lhc @xmath137 we see that a high luminosity tevatron or the lhc would have good potential to explore this anomalous @xmath33 coupling .",
    "we have thus far only concentrated on the leptonic decays @xmath138 . given the possibility of efficient @xmath83-tagging at the tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite detectors , one may consider also studying the decay @xmath139 , with a branching fraction of about 15% . the signal rate would be approximately doubled and this mode might prove quite interesting if one could keep the qcd background under control with @xmath83-tagging .",
    "although not addressed in this paper , it may be equally possible that there exist other effective operators resulting in flavor - changing neutral current interactions , such as @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "these operators may have different physics origin and should be studied separately . in a hadron collider environment , the signals associated with these vertices may not be easily separated from the qcd backgrounds .",
    "this issue is currently under investigation @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we have examined the low energy experimental constraints on a possible anomalous top - quark coupling associated with the flavor - changing neutral current vertex @xmath0 .",

    ", a three - year running of the tevatron main injector ( 3 fb@xmath18 ) would reach a sensitivity of br@xmath1433% ; with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath18 at an upgraded tevatron , one should be able to explore new physics at a level of br@xmath1431% . at the lhc , one can reach a value of @xmath144 or br@xmath145 with a luminosity of 100 fb@xmath18 . because of the cleanliness of the experimental signature and the smallness of the sm prediction for this channel , observation of this rare decay would clearly signal new physics beyond the sm .",
    "if seen , such a signal would provide important clues to understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and possibly fermion ( especially top - quark ) mass generation .",
