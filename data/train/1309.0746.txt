    "in the past fifteen years , the remarkable original proposal of refs .",
    "@xcite , relaying a potential physical relevance to hamiltonians respecting parity ( @xmath2 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath3 ) symmetries , has received considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "this proposal has highlighted the interest in considering ( as operators potentially bearing real spectra ) hamiltonians that are invariant under these fundamental symmetries as an extension of the more standardly considered self - adjoint hamiltonian operators of quantum mechanics . while for a decade since their inception",
    ", these notions were studied intensely at the linear level , especially in the mathematical community ( see e.g. the review of  @xcite ) , more recently it was realized that linear optics  @xcite could present an ideal playground for the realization of such non - hermitian settings ( i.e. , in `` open '' systems bearing gain and loss but in a @xmath0-symmetric form ) . in particular , discrete systems  @xcite with balanced gain and loss have been suggested as reduced models of the non - hermitian optics , obeying remarkable properties of waveguiding and giving origin to the blossoming field of discrete @xmath0-symmetric optics .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry was thus first studied experimentally in the optical experiments of  @xcite . as a natural extension of optical applications",
    ", it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to consider nonlinear optical systems whose linear limit is @xmath0 symmetric , and in particular it was shown that such systems with a periodic potential support stable solitons .    the simplest basic element of the discrete @xmath0-symmetric optics is a dimer with one site subjected to dissipation and another site subjected to gain  @xcite . as a natural application of this system",
    ", one can consider a coupler with one active and one lossy waveguide  @xcite .",
    "when the nonlinear effects are included , one deals with a @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear coupler , i.e. mathematically with a @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear dimer .",
    "such a dimer with a kerr - type nonlinearity was intensively studied showing remarkable properties . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that such a nonlinear coupler is an integrable system allowing for a solution in the form of quadratures .",
    "the effect of nonlinear suppression of the periodic time reversals and the beam switching to the waveguide with gain was reported in  @xcite ( a similar switching effect can also be implemented with @xmath0-symmetric impurities inserted in an otherwise conservative coupler  @xcite ) .",
    "further studies of the nonlinear discrete optical systems were performed in a number of directions .",
    "we mention a few of these in what follows .",
    "first , including one more coordinate ( in addition to the evolution one ; in optical applications such systems could be seen as coupled planar waveguides with balanced gain and loss ) made it relevant to consider the dynamics of bright  @xcite and dark  @xcite solitons , breathers  @xcite , as well as instabilities and rogue waves  @xcite .",
    "another extension of nonlinear dimer activity is related to the inclusion of @xmath0-symmetric defects in discrete nonlinear systems . in the latter context ,",
    "problems such as nonlinear wave scattering  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and the lifting of the degeneracy of discrete vortices  @xcite were considered .",
    "finally , a nonlinear dimer or more generally the so - called nonlinear `` oligomers '' ( i.e. , few site configurations ) introduced in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , were shown to allow for the existence of continuous families of nonlinear modes  @xcite . among these",
    ", a @xmath0-symmetric quadrimer model naturally appears in the description of light propagation in a birefringent coupler  @xcite .",
    "discrete solitons in different types of infinite @xmath0-symmetric waveguide arrays were studied numerically  @xcite and analytical proofs for their existence have been proposed using the anticontnuum limit  @xcite and via analysis of the modes bifurcating from the linear limit  @xcite .",
    "solitons in a necklace of coupled dispersive waveguides were reported in @xcite .",
    "most of the above investigations have taken place at the level of the well - known kerr - type nonlinearity .",
    "existence of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion in @xmath0-symmetric systems with more general cubic nonlinearities was investigated in  @xcite . nevertheless , another type of nonlinearity of particular interest to optics is the quadratic one  @xcite . in the latter context ,",
    "switching in two parallel waveguides was studied in @xcite .",
    "the intensity - dependent switching in",
    "lithium niobate directional couplers was subsequently first observed in @xcite . the particular case of a dimer with one nonlinear and one linear waveguide was considered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear localized modes in arrays with a quadratic nonlinearity are considered in numerous works  @xcite .",
    "experimentally  @xcite , the fundamental modes of a second harmonic are strongly confined , so the coupling constant between second harmonic modes in different waveguides is very small and sometimes can even be neglected . discrete solitary waves in this configuration were systematically probed in  @xcite .",
    "the plane waves and localized modes in this case were considered in  @xcite .",
    "extensions in the case of two - dimensional states including discrete vortices were proposed in  @xcite , while the mobility of the solitary waves in both one and two dimensions was explored in  @xcite .",
    "recently the studies of solitons in quadratically nonlinear media were extended to @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "more specifically , the existence and stability of solitons for localized potentials in quadratic media was explored in  @xcite . in the work of   @xcite",
    ", the effect of periodic @xmath0-symmetric potentials on @xmath1 solitons was described .",
    "it is on that direction of exploring the interplay of quadratic nonlinearity and @xmath0-symmetric potentials that the present work is focused .",
    "it is appreciated that even in the case of two waveguides , this combination offers a significant level of complexity , as well as a number of features that are absent in the cubic kerr nonlinearity case . in particular ,",
    "due to quadratic nonlinearity and the particular structure of eigenvectors of the underlying linear @xmath0-symmetric operator , continuation of the linear eigenvectors into the nonlinear domain is performed in two different ways , depending on whether the first or the second harmonic is vanishing in the linear eigenvector . we develop perturbative formal expansions that enable us to capture analytically these two different types of bifurcations of the nonlinear modes from the linear solutions .",
    "next , we employ numerical computations and observe the symmetry breaking , as well as saddle - node bifurcations and identify the stability characteristics of the solutions . in the case of instability , the dynamical evolution of the configurations is explored .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section  [ linear ] , upon introducing the general model , we focus on its linear analysis . in section  [ sec : bif ] , we introduce nonlinearity and analytically explore how it affects the linear modes ( i.e. , consider the bifurcations of nonlinear modes from linear ones ) . in section  [ sec : nonlin ] , we corroborate our analytical considerations with detailed numerical results identifying the nonlinear modes and their stability for different values of the propagation constant and the gain / loss strength parameters . for the unstable modes , we touch upon their dynamical evolution in section  [ sec : dyn ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] , we summarize our findings and present some interesting directions for future studies .",
    "the prototypical setup of equations describing the @xmath0 symmetric coupler with quadratic nonlinearity reads as follows :    [ basic_equations ] @xmath4    each waveguide contains two harmonics : the fundamental field ( first harmonic ) @xmath5 and the second harmonic @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which are nonlinearly coupled .",
    "the linear coupling between the first harmonics is characterized by the parameter @xmath8 , while that of the second harmonics by @xmath9 .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be considered positive . the gain ( loss ) strength in the two arms of the dimer",
    "is given by the parameters @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , for the first ( @xmath12 ) and second ( @xmath13 ) harmonics , respectively .",
    "in what follows , we will explore different parameter values of @xmath14 to get a systematic sense of the model phenomenology .",
    "the overdot in ( [ basic_equations ] ) denotes the derivative with respect to the evolution variable which , here , we will denote as @xmath15 ( although in the optical realm it represents the propagation distance @xmath16 ) .",
    "being interested in the stationary modes , we make use of the ansatz @xmath17 @xmath18 is the propagation constant , and @xmath19 is @xmath20 constant column vector .",
    "this reduces ( [ basic_equations ] ) to the eigenvalue problem @xmath21 with the respective linear operator given by @xmath22 and the nonlinear part described by the matrix - function @xmath23 where @xmath24 are used for the entries of vector @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath25 is @xmath0-symmetric with respect to the action of the parity operator @xmath26 and time reversal operator @xmath27 performing the complex conjugation ( along with @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 .    in the linear case [",
    "when one neglects all the nonlinear terms , i.e @xmath30 the problem decouples into two @xmath0-symmetric dimers : the first one is composed of fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 and another one of the fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "now the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : stat ] ) is reduced to @xmath35 , where we use tilde in order to refer to eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the linear problem .",
    "solutions of the latter equation can be found from the spectrum of the operator @xmath36 .",
    "the computation yields the following linear eigenvalues @xmath37 the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues @xmath38 can be written down as follows : @xmath39 while for @xmath40 one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 . introducing the inner product as @xmath43 ( hereafter @xmath44 is the hermitian conjugation ) , we observe that the linear eigenvectors obey the following relation : @xmath45 notice however that @xmath46 .    generally speaking , the existence of two different gain / loss coefficients in @xmath0-symmetric lattices results in the existence of different `` phases '' @xcite featuring different linear properties of the model . in the case at hand the linear part of",
    "the system can belong to one of the four phases : ( i ) unbroken ( or _ exact _ ) @xmath0 symmetry when all the four eigenvalues ( [ e ] ) are real ; this phase corresponds to the rectangle given by the inequalities @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; ( ii ) @xmath38 are complex conjugates while @xmath40 remain real which corresponds to @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; ( iii ) _ vice versa _ , @xmath38 are real while @xmath40 are complex conjugates ; this corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; ( iv ) all four eigenvalues have nonzero imaginary part , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "phases ( ii)-(iv ) correspond to the broken @xmath0 symmetry . on the plane ( @xmath55 there exist four _ quadruple points _ corresponding to the corners of the above mentioned rectangle : @xmath56 .",
    "these are the exceptional points where all four phases touch .    if the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then the choice of the eigenvectors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w12])([eq : w34 ] ) makes them @xmath0 _ invariant _ , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "one can see that in the absence of the degeneracy , i.e. at all @xmath58 different , in the stationary linear regime the total energy is concentrated in only one harmonic of each waveguide .",
    "namely , the field is guided only in the first ( second ) harmonic , i.e. @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , for the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this will prove rather critical in some of the considerations that follow ( especially as regards the continuation of nonlinear modes from the linear limit ) .",
    "notice that the linear modes @xmath61 and @xmath62 at the same time solve the full ( i.e. the nonlinear ) system ( [ basic_equations ] ) because in the absence of the energy guided in the fundamental mode , the system is effectively linear : @xmath63 .",
    "in the previous section we computed solutions of the linear problem which can be formally obtained from the full nonlinear problem ( [ eq : stat ] ) by neglecting the nonlinear term @xmath64 . in this section",
    "we look for solutions of the full nonlinear problem bifurcating from the linear solutions . to this end",
    "we construct formal small parameter expansions around the linear eigenvectors ( [ eq : w12 ] ) and ( [ eq : w34 ] ) .",
    "however , properties of the eigenvectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 are essentially different : the latter couple of linear eigenvectors simultaneously solve the full nonlinear problem because the nonlinear operator vanishes at them , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "however for the eigenvectors @xmath65 one has @xmath68 .",
    "this suggests that the formal expansions for the nonlinear modes bifurcating from @xmath65 and @xmath66 should be constructed in different ways .      since @xmath68",
    ", one can expect that the linear solutions @xmath65 can approximate nonlinear modes only in a situation when the nonlinear term @xmath64 is negligible in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "this situation takes place if one considers nonlinear modes @xmath19 of small amplitude , i.e. at @xmath69 which is usually referred to as the _ linear limit _ ( here @xmath70 stands for a norm of the vector @xmath71 , which could be , say , the euclidean one ) .",
    "therefore , let us search for small - amplitude nonlinear modes bifurcating from the linear solutions @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken and all the eigenvalues ( [ e ] ) are distinct from each other and introduce the following formal expansions for the nonlinear modes @xmath72 bifurcating from the @xmath73th linear eigenstate ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is a small positive formal parameter , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the vectors and the coefficients to be determined .",
    "the expansion ( [ expan_w ] ) and the definition ( [ f ] ) imply that @xmath78 .    since the linear eigenvectors @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) constitute a complete basis , we can search for the correction @xmath81 in the form @xmath82 ( notice that in the latter equation we set @xmath83 which can always be achieved by means of renormalization of the small parameter @xmath75 ) . substituting",
    "the introduced expansions into the nonlinear problem ( [ eq : stat ] ) , in the @xmath84-order we have @xmath85    an unusual property of the case at hand is that the nonlinearity is orthogonal to the states @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 thus applying @xmath89 and @xmath90 to the both sides of ( [ ord2 ] ) , using that @xmath91 and @xmath92 and accounting for ( [ ortt ] ) , one readily finds that @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "finally , applying @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we compute the coefficients @xmath97 explicitly which yields the following expression : @xmath98    proceeding to the next order of the expansions , at @xmath99 we obtain @xmath100 where we have used ( [ w1 ] ) and the property @xmath101 yielding @xmath102 . thus applying @xmath89 to ( [ w2 ] )",
    ", we compute ( recall @xmath7 ) @xmath103 formulas ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w3 ] ) determine the required terms of the expansions .",
    "as it was mentioned above in our specific case @xmath63 and thus the linear eigenvectors @xmath66 at the same time solve the original nonlinear model ( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "this means that the nonlinear modes ( if any ) bifurcating from @xmath66 should in general possess finite nonzero amplitude at the point of the bifurcation .",
    "in other words , the bifurcations of nonlinear modes @xmath19 occur not from the linear limit ( which is understood as @xmath104 ) , but rather from a finite amplitude solution ( see also the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "this readily suggests that the small parameter expansions for nonlinear modes bifurcating from @xmath66 should be looked for as follows ( @xmath105 ) : @xmath106 where we have introduced the proportionality coefficients @xmath107 , which must be defined from requirement of consistency of the asymptotic expansion . notice that if @xmath108 , then at the point of bifurcation ( i.e. at @xmath109 ) , the power of the first harmonic goes to zero , i.e. @xmath110 , while @xmath111 stay finite .",
    "now one has @xmath112 . substituting the introduced expansions into the nonlinear problem ( [ eq : stat ] ) , we observe that it is automatically satisfied in the leading order @xmath113 . in the @xmath114-order for @xmath105",
    "we obtain @xmath115 employing again representation ( [ exp_w ] ) [ recall that @xmath67 ] we find @xmath117 . applying @xmath118 to both sides of ( [ eq : vep1w34 ] ) and using properties",
    "( [ ortt ] ) and @xmath119 we find that @xmath120 .",
    "next , we apply @xmath89 and using the same arguments find that @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we apply @xmath121 and @xmath122 which yields the following system : @xmath123   c_{2 } \\langle{\\tilde{\\bf w}}_{2}^*,\\lambda { \\tilde{\\bf w}}_{2 } \\rangle ( { \\tilde{e}}_j -   { \\tilde{e}}_{2 } )    -\\alpha_j c_1   \\langle{\\tilde{\\bf w}}_{2}^ * , f({\\tilde{\\bf w}}_{1 } ) { \\tilde{\\bf w}}_j\\rangle    \\nonumber \\\\   - \\alpha_j c_2   \\langle{\\tilde{\\bf w}}_{2}^ * , f({\\tilde{\\bf w}}_{2 } )   { \\tilde{\\bf w}}_j \\rangle = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given @xmath105 the latter equation form a homogeneous linear system with respect to the coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the compatibility condition of this system results in a _",
    "quadratic _ equation with respect to @xmath126 whose roots give admissible values of @xmath126 in ( [ expan_w34 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath126 is chosen to satisfy the compatibility condition , then coefficients of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are given up to a multiplier , which however can be scaled out by means of renormalization of the small parameter @xmath75 .    in order to determine",
    "@xmath129 one can proceed to the @xmath84-order , which yields @xmath130 after applying @xmath89 one finds @xmath131 which gives the leading order correction to the propagation constant .",
    "the results of two previous subsections show that due to the interplay between the quadratic nonlinearity and the particular structure of eigenvectors of the underlying linear problem , continuation of the linear eigenvectors into the nonlinear domain occurs in two different ways , depending on whether the second or the first harmonic is vanishing in the linear eigenvector . in the first case , when the total energy of the linear eigenvectors @xmath65 is fully concentrated in the first harmonic ,",
    "the bifurcations of nonlinear solutions from the linear ones resemble the standard kerr nonlinearity case : each linear eigenstate gives birth to one family of nonlinear modes , and at the point of the bifurcation ( @xmath109 ) the amplitude of the nonlinear modes is zero , gradually increasing when one passes from @xmath109 to small nonzero @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the bifurcations occur from the linear limit .",
    "however , in the second situation , when the linear eigenvectors @xmath66 have a vanishing first harmonic contribution and a nonvanishing second harmonic one , the bifurcations of nonlinear modes occur in another way .",
    "now , at the point of bifurcation ( @xmath109 ) , the nonlinear modes generically bear a finite nonzero amplitude due to the presence of the additional term with the coefficient @xmath126 . moreover , since the possible values of @xmath126 are given by the quadratic equation , each linear eigenstate in general gives birth to at least two physically distinct families of nonlinear modes .",
    "finally we notice that we have computed values of @xmath126 for several choices of model parameters , obtaining in this way analytical prediction for the amplitude of nonlinear modes at the point of bifurcation ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "for all cases that we checked we observed that the analytically predicted amplitude of the bifurcating nonlinear modes agrees with that obtained from direct numerical results that follow in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "going beyond the consideration of the nonlinear modes described by the expansions ( [ expan_w])([expan_e ] ) and ( [ expan_w34])([expan_e34 ] ) , let us now turn to the set of all stationary nonlinear modes obeying the system ( [ eq : stat ] ) .",
    "we observe that the latter system has a considerable wealth of solutions of which we provide a representative set in what follows .",
    "in particular , we focus on nonlinear solutions preserving the symmetry pertinent to the linear part , i.e. to the @xmath0-invariant modes obeying @xmath132 . using for such modes the amplitude - phase decomposition",
    "we rewrite the stationary solution @xmath19 introduced by ( [ lin_ansatz ] ) in the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are real stationary amplitudes and @xmath136 are stationary phases .",
    "this ansatz reduces ( [ eq : stat ] ) to the system of stationary equations as follows    @xmath137    ( where it is assumed that @xmath138 ) . further splitting to real and imaginary parts yields four equations :    [ eq : sys4 ] @xmath139",
    "if we take @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 as four unknowns in the system ( [ eq : sys4 ] ) , then one can expect that there exists one or several solutions for any given @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we can speak about _ continuous families _ of nonlinear modes . in order to visualize these families , one can introduce the quantity @xmath140 which corresponds to the manley - rowe invariant ( of the conservative system @xmath141 where it is a conserved quantity ) . in the case at hand",
    "we have @xmath142 .",
    "then the families of the nonlinear modes can be displayed as dependencies on the @xmath143 plane as the functions @xmath144 _ vs _ @xmath18 .",
    "several examples are presented in fig .",

    "notice however , that the two families bifurcating from @xmath159 for @xmath141 are not distinguishable in fig .",
    "this is because for each given @xmath18 the modes belonging to those families are mutually complex conjugate .",
    "therefore , these solutions have the same @xmath144 characteristic .",

    "one can observe that the stability situation may be fairly complicated with the same family having alternating domains of stability and instability ( these will be analyzed in detail below for the parameters used ) .",
