    "in low - energy heavy - ion fusion reactions , it has been known that excitations of the colliding nuclei considerably influence the reaction dynamics , that is , fusion cross sections are largely enhanced as compared to the prediction of a simple potential model @xcite . in order to take into account the excitations during reactions , the coupled - channels method has been developed .",
    "many experimental data have been successfully accounted for with this method by including a few internal degrees of freedom which are coupled strongly to the ground state @xcite .",
    "however , when a large number of channels are involved , the coupled - channels calculations become increasingly difficult .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , fusion reactions in massive systems , in which many non - collective excitations may play an important role @xcite .    to deal with this problem ,",
    "many phenomenological models based on the classical concept of friction were proposed in connection with deep inelastic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . among them , it has been found that the classical langevin treatment works well for fusion reactions and deep inlastic collisions when the incident energy is higher than the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "when the incident energy is close to the barrier , however , the fusion reaction takes place by quantum tunneling .",
    "hence , in order to apply these models to low - energy fusion reactions , a quantum mechanical extension of the friction models is essential .",
    "another important issue is to extend the coupled - channels approach to massive systems by taking into account the dissipation effects and to develop a quantal theory for deep inelastic collision with energy and angular momentum dissipations",
    ". such theory would be able to describe simultaneously dissipative quantum tunneling below the coulomb barrier and deep inelastic collision above the barrier . in that way",
    ", one may resolve a long standing problem of surface diffuseness anomaly in heavy - ion fusion reactions , that is , an anomaly that a significantly large value for the surface diffuseness parameter in an inter - nuclear woods - saxon potential has to be used in order to account for above barrier data of fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "such theory would also provide a consistent description for deep subbarrier hindrance of fusion cross sections @xcite , for which the dynamics after the touching of the colliding nuclei play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "quantum friction has attracted lots of attention as a general problem of open quantum systems @xcite . to date , many attempts at developing a quantum friction model have been made .",
    "they can be mainly categorized into the following two approaches .",
    "the first is to consider a system with bath , for which the environmental bath is often simplified as , e.g. , a collection of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to treat the couplings to the bath implicitly and introduce a phenomenological hamiltonian with which the classical equation of motion with a frictional force is reproduced as expectation values . for this approach , caldirola and kanai @xcite , kostin @xcite , and",
    "albrecht @xcite proposed a hermitian hamiltonian , whose equation of motion contains a linear frictional force , while dekker @xcite invented an approach with a non - hermitian hamiltonian .    in this paper , we employ the second approach and investigate quantum tunneling in the presence of friction .",
    "even though the first approach is more microscopic , physical quantities are easier to calculate with the second approach , and thus it is easier to gain physical insight into the effect of friction on quantum tunneling .",
    "we particularly consider the three hermitian models for quantum friction , that is , the caldirola - kanai , the kostin , and the albrecht models , in order to discuss the tunneling problem with quantum friction .",
    "we mention that these hamiltonians have been applied to a tunneling problem @xcite , but a systematic study , including a comparison among the models , has yet to be carried out with respect to tunneling probabilities . in this connection",
    ", we notice that hasse has compared the three models for a free wave packet propagation and for a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "he has shown that the time dependence of the width of a gaussian wave packet varies significantly from one model to another while all of these three models lead to the same classical equation of motion @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not obvious whether the three models lead to similar penetrabilities to each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly introduce the three quantum friction models which we employ . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present our results for penetrability of a one - dimensional barrier .",
    "in order to compare among the three models , we first carry out a detailed study on numerical accuracy of the calculations for a free wave packet propagation .",
    "we then discuss the energy dependence of the penetrability obtained with each of these three models .",
    "we also discuss the results in terms of barrier distribution .",
    "we finally summarize the paper in sec .",
    "we consider a system with a particle whose mass is @xmath0 , moving in a one - dimensional space @xmath1 with a potential @xmath2 and a linear frictional force .",
    "we here consider potential scattering , and regard @xmath1 as the distance between the particle and the center of the potential .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the particle reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kinetic momentum , the dot denoting the time derivative , and @xmath5 is a friction coefficient .",
    "we have assumed that the potential depends only on @xmath1 . from the classical equation of motion , eq .",

    ", the hamiltonian depends explicitly on time as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath17 can be regarded as the kinetic momentum operator , since the relation @xmath18 holds .",

    "( [ eq : classicaldr ] ) . for the albrecht model , on the other hand",
    ", one obtains @xmath33 as is desired .",
    "notice that the energy dissipation is proportional to @xmath34 in the caldirola - kanai and the kostin models ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ckdisp ] ) and ( [ eq : kodisp ] ) ) , while it is @xmath35 in the albrecht model . in the classical limit , these quantities are the same to each other , but they may differ in quantum mechanics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , hasse discussed a generalization of the albrecht model and suggested a better nonlinear potential , @xmath26 , which reproduces the classical reduced frequency for a damped harmonic oscillator . for simplicity , however , we consider only the albrecht model in this paper .      in the original models for quantum friction ,",
    "the friction constant @xmath5 is treated to be a constant .",
    "when considering friction in a collision problem , however , we have to introduce a friction form factor @xmath36 , since the energy dissipation occurs only during interaction .",
    "that is , the form factor @xmath36 vanishes outside the range of the potential , @xmath2 .",
    "a naive replacement of @xmath5 in the model hamiltonians with @xmath37 does not work due to the @xmath1 dependence in the form factor .",
    "alternatively , in this paper we consider a time dependent friction coefficient @xmath38 which vanishes after the interaction . in the simple form of @xmath39",
    ", the dissipation continuously occurs even after the interaction if an incident wave is equally bifurcated into transmitted and reflected waves . to avoid this undesired behavior ,",
    "we choose the form , @xmath40 in ref .",
    "@xcite , hahn and hasse discussed a more complex form factor but showed that the behavior is quite similar to the simple one .",
    "an extension to the time dependent friction coefficient is obvious for the nonlinear potential models ; just changing @xmath5 to @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) . for the caldirola - kanai model , on the other hand",
    ", the following modification is necessary @xcite : @xmath41 here we have assumed that the initial time is @xmath42 .",

    "( [ eq : uncertain ] ) to @xmath43 = i\\hbar \\,e^{-\\int^t_0 dt ' \\gamma(t')}.\\ ] ]    because of these modifications , the three hamiltonians are now nonlinear .",
    "it means that the superposition principle is violated .",
    "we are forced to admit this undesired property , since they are inevitable in the present formalism .",
    "to calculate the tunneling probability with the three models discussed in the previous section , we integrate the time dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath44 in what follows , we employ the same potential as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , @xmath45 with @xmath46 mev and @xmath47 fm .",
    "this potential somehow simulates the @xmath48ni+@xmath48ni reaction , and thus we take @xmath49 mev .",
    "before we introduce the friction , we first discuss the time - dependent approach to quantum tunneling . for the calculation of the tunneling probability for",
    "the time - dependent nonlinear hamiltonians , the usual time - independent approach , which imposes the asymptotic plane wave boundary condition , would not be applicable .",
    "an alternative method is to make a wave packet propagate , then observe how it bifurcates after it passes the potential region .",
    "a wave packet is a superposition of various waves , each of which has a different energy .",
    "hence , in order to obtain the tunneling probability for a certain energy , one needs either to perform the energy projection @xcite or to broaden the spatial distribution of the wave packet so that the energy distribution becomes narrow @xcite . in the former method",
    ", the tunneling probability is calculated as the ratio of the energy distribution of a transmitted wave packet to that of the incident one at a fixed energy .",
    "this method , however , is not applicable in our case , since we do not know a priori how much energy is lost during a collision at each energy .",
    "therefore , we shall employ the latter approach here . to this end , it is necessary to know how narrow the energy distribution should be in the wave packet in order to obtain meaningful results .    to clarify the effect of finite width in the energy distribution , we take the initial wave function in the energy space @xmath50 with the gaussian form , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the mean energy and the width of the energy distribution , respectively . multiplying @xmath50 by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and making its fourier",

    "we consider a propagation of the wave packet from @xmath58 towards the positive @xmath1 direction , and thus we make the integration from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . even though this initial wave function is somewhat different from the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite , we find that this form is more convenient in order to discuss a correspondence to the time - independent solutions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : exwp ] ) below ) .    by integrating the time dependent schrringer equation , ( [ eq : tdseq ] ) , from @xmath42 to @xmath61 , by which time the bifurcation of the wave packet has been completed , we calculate the tunneling probability @xmath62 as @xmath63 in implementing the time integration , it is helpful to introduce the dimensionless time @xmath64 , by measuring the time in units of a typical time scale of the problem , @xmath65 . for this , we take @xmath65 as the time taken by a free classical particle to travel some distance @xmath66 , that is , @xmath67 .",
    "we choose @xmath66 so that the final mean position of the transmitted wave packet at @xmath68 is almost independent of @xmath69 ( and the friction coefficient , @xmath5 ) for each parameter set .",

    "the so called fusion barrier distribution has been widely used in analyses of experimental data @xcite .",

    "the barrier distribution for the caldirola - kanai model is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] .",
    "whereas the barrier distribution shows a symmetric peak in the case of no friction , some strength is shifted towards higher energies as the strength of the friction increases and the barrier distribution becomes structured .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a similar behavior has been obtained in coupled - channels calculations for fusion in relatively heavy systems , such as @xmath130mo+@xmath130mo @xcite .",
    "the barrier distribution indicates that the energy damping during tunneling results in a increased effective barrier , whose height is thus energy dependent and is determined by the strength of friction .",
    "this leads us to two different points of view for dissipative quantum tunneling .",
    "from one view point , the incident energy is damped by friction while a wave packet traverses towards a fixed barrier .",
    "this can be interpreted in a different way as that the effective barrier increases dynamically due to the friction for a fixed value of incident energy .",
    "the barrier distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] well represents this dynamical point of view of friction .",
    "we have investigated the effects of friction on quantum tunneling by applying the three friction models , the caldirola - kanai , the kostin , and the albrecht models , to a one - dimensional tunneling problem .",
    "we have studied the energy dependence of the tunneling probability obtained as the barrier penetration rate of a wave packet , whose initial energy variance is set to be small enough . in order to limit a region where the dissipation is active , we have introduced the time dependent friction coefficient . we have shown that the friction tends to prevent the wave packet from penetrating the barrier , and thus the penetrability decreases as a function of the strength of friction .",
    "we have found that the three models lead to similar penetrabilities to each other .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of friction on quantum tunneling in terms of barrier distribution and have shown that the barrier distribution becomes structured due to friction by shifting effective barriers towards higher energies . among the three models which we considered in this paper , we have found that the numerical accuracy can be most easily handled with the caldirola - kanai model .",
    "very recently , it has been found experimentally that heavy - ion multi - nucleon transfer processes in @xmath131o , @xmath132f + @xmath133pb reactions populate highly excited states in the target - like nuclei @xcite .",
    "one may be able to describe such processes by extending the friction models considered in this paper to multi - channel cases .",
    "we are now working towards this direction , and we will report our results in a separate paper . another interesting future direction is to include the random force term to the quantum friction hamiltonians and investigate its effect on quantum tunneling . for this purpose , a proper quantization of the fluctuation term will be needed ."
