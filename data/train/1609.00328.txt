    "planck_hfi data @xcite .",
    "many proposals have been suggested to solve this tension ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "two possible extensions to the @xmath1cdm scenario have attracted significant attention .",
    "one is the possibility of a dark radiation component with @xmath4 , which does not seem workable any more in light of the new _",
    "planck_hfi constraint on the optical depth @xcite for which @xmath5 at @xmath6 c.l . from planck ttteee+simlow .",
    "the other extension is a dark energy equation of state different from @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , recently , the authors of @xcite pointed out that , by considering a power - law inflation ( hereafter pli ) , introduced the first time by @xcite , in presence of a dark radiation component , the local value of the hubble constant by riess et al .",
    "2016 @xcite and the most recent cmb anisotropy data by the _ planck_collaboration @xcite are in perfect agreement , provided @xmath8 at @xmath9 c.l ..    given the well - known correlations between parameters within @xmath1cdm , we consider in this comment the implication of this scenario ( pli with a free dark radiation ) for the @xmath10 linear power normalisation , @xmath2 or clustering parameter .",
    "indeed , within _",
    "planck_-normalised @xmath1cdm , there is already a 2@xmath11 tension with the weak lensing measurements of @xmath2 from the cfhtlens survey @xcite and kids-450 @xcite .",
    "we also assess the effect of adding the cmb polarization @xmath12 modes constraint provided by the common analysis of _ planck _ , bicep2 and keck array @xcite , or the new determination on the reionization optical depth obtained with _",
    "planck_hfi data @xcite ( which was not considered by @xcite ) .",
    "as a baseline , we will explore simultaneously 8 parameters of @xmath1cdm .",
    "these include the baryon and cold dark matter energy densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the ratio between the sound horizon and the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath15 and the reionization optical depth @xmath16 . for the inflationary parameters , we consider the scalar spectral index , n__s @xmath17 , the amplitude of the primordial spectrum , @xmath18 , and a contribution of primordial gravitational waves with a tensor - to - scalar ratio of amplitude @xmath19 at the pivot scale @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we also vary the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore include @xmath19 and @xmath21 to the minimum 6 base @xmath1cdmparameters which provide an adequate fit to _ planck_data ( assuming a flat universe ) .",
    "these parameters are explored within the range of the conservative priors reported in table  [ priors ] .",
    "=    in a second step , we repeat the same analysis considering the pli model by imposing the following inflation consistency relationship @xcite : @xmath22 with @xmath23    we find the constraints on these 8 parameters by combining several recent datasets .",
    "first of all , we call `` plancktt + lowteb '' the full range of the 2015 temperature power spectrum ( @xmath24 ) combined with the polarization power spectra in the multipoles range @xmath25 provided by the _ planck_collaboration @xcite . secondly , when including the high multipoles _ planck_polarization data @xcite , we call this combination of datasets `` planckttteee + lowteb '' ( which is considered less robust than the previous one by the _",
    "planck_collaboration , at least for order 1@xmath26 wiggles relative to the plain @xmath1cdmpolarisation spectra ) . afterwards , when replacing the lowteb dataset with a gaussian prior on the reionization optical depth @xmath27 , as obtained recently from _",
    "planck_hfi data @xcite , we refer to it as `` tau055 '' . moreover , we consider the 2015 _ planck_measurements of the cmb lensing potential power spectrum @xmath28 @xcite , and we refer to this dataset as `` lensing '' .",
    "finally , we add the cmb polarization @xmath12 modes constraints provided by the 2014 common analysis of _ planck _ , bicep2 and keck array @xcite , and we refer to this dataset as `` bkp '' .    for definiteness , we have used the june 2016 version of the publicly available monte - carlo markov chain package ` cosmomc ` @xcite , with a convergence diagnostic based on the gelman and rubin statistic .",
    "this version , which we modified to include the pli case , implements an efficient sampling of the posterior distribution using the fast / slow parameter decorrelations @xcite , and it includes the support for the _ planck_data release 2015 likelihood code @xcite ( see http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/ ) .",
    "the result of these explorations are given in tables  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] where we report the constraints at @xmath29 c.l .",
    "on the cosmological parameters , the two tables differing by considering or not the pli specific constraint of eq .",
    "[ eq : plidef ] . by comparing the two tables we see that imposing a pli model affects the cosmological parameters in several ways .",
    "all the constraints that we will quote hereinafter there will be at @xmath9 c.l .",
    ", unless otherwise expressed .     versus @xmath21 plane , coloured by @xmath3 , under the assumption of pli .",
    "]     and @xmath30 confidence levels on the @xmath19 vs @xmath21 plane under the assumption of pli . ]",
    "first of all , pli produces a shift towards higher values of the neutrino effective number @xmath21 reducing the error by a half . for planck",
    "tt + lowteb , @xmath21 changes from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "this shift corresponds to a higher @xmath3 value , @xmath33 km / s / mpc for the same combination of datasets , due to the degeneracy between these two parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "this increase of the hubble constant parameter solves the tension existing between the local measurements provided by riess et al .",
    "2016 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34 km / s / mpc , and the value obtained from the _ planck_cmb anisotropy data @xcite , i.e. @xmath35 km / s / mpc in a @xmath1cdm framework , as argued in @xcite .",
    "we note though that imposing the power - law inflation model , degrades somewhat the fit to the planck tt + lowteb data , producing a @xmath36 .     and @xmath30 confidence levels on the @xmath3 vs @xmath2 plane under the assumption of pli . ]     and @xmath30 confidence levels on the @xmath19 vs @xmath37 plane , without considering the pli .",
    "]    imposing pli also leads to a higher value for the scalar spectral index n__s @xmath17 , that is only possible when @xmath21 is free to vary , since the two are positively correlated , as we can see in fig .",
    "this is also the reason why n__s @xmath17  goes down again and produces evidence for a non zero tensor - to - scalar ratio , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , when @xmath21 is further constrained by more data which shift it back towards the standard value .    indeed the new constraints on the reionization optical depth from _ planck_hfi data @xcite reinstates compatibility with the standard value of @xmath38 for the neutrino effective number @xmath21 which restores the tension on @xmath3 . specifically , we find @xmath39 and @xmath40 km / s / mpc for planck tt + tau055 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 km / s / mpc for planck ttteee + tau055",
    ". moreover , an evidence on @xmath19 different from zero at more than 3@xmath11 appears : we find @xmath43 for planck tt + tau055 and @xmath44 for planck ttteee + tau055 . in this case also , when imposing pli , the fit to the planck tt + tau055 data gets worse , producing a @xmath45 for one less degree of freedom .    for the same reason , the clustering parameter @xmath2 moves towards higher values when",
    "imposing pli , since it is positively correlated with the hubble constant , see fig .",
    "numerically , it moves from @xmath46 to @xmath47 when imposing a power - law inflation for planck tt + lowteb .",
    "this enhancement of the @xmath2 value therefore increases notably the tension between the _ planck_data and the weak lensing measurements from the cfhtlens survey @xcite and kids-450 @xcite .    finally , when we include the cmb polarization @xmath12 modes dataset provided by the common analysis of _ planck _ ,",
    "bicep2 and the keck array @xcite , a value of @xmath19 different from zero at more than 2@xmath11 appears , i.e. , @xmath48 for planck ttteee + lowteb + bkp in the power - law inflation , and the agreement between @xmath3 from riess et al .",
    "2016 @xcite and the _ planck_data is confirmed . here",
    "again , the fit to the combination of datasets planck ttteee + lowteb + bkp gets worse when imposing the power - law inflation , producing a @xmath49 for one less degree of freedom .",
    "this evidence for @xmath19 different from zero is totally absent without imposing the power - law inflation , as we can see in fig .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite pointed out that by considering a power law inflation model and a free dark radiation component , the local measurements of the hubble constant provided by riess et al .",
    "2016 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34 km / s / mpc at @xmath9 cl , is in perfect agreement with the value that follows when analysing the _",
    "planck_cmb anisotropy data @xcite , inducing a @xmath8 at @xmath9 cl .    in this comment",
    ", we confront that scenario ( pli+dark radiation ) with more data than initially considered . as noted in the previous section , the hubble constant and the clustering parameter",
    "are positively correlated , therefore a higher @xmath3 value corresponds to an increased value of @xmath2 . when the @xmath3 tension subsides , this degeneracy produces a shift of the mean value of the clustering parameter which exacerbates the tension with the weak lensing measurements from the cfhtlens survey @xcite and kids-450 @xcite    we then considered the implication of adding the cmb polarization @xmath12 modes dataset provided by the common analysis of _ planck _ , bicep2 and keck array @xcite . in this case , interestingly , a value of @xmath19 different from zero at more than 2@xmath11 is preferred , @xmath48 at @xmath9 cl for planck ttteee + lowteb + bkp ( in the power - law inflation case ) , while the agreement between @xmath3 from riess et al .",
    "2016 @xcite and the _ planck_data is maintained .",
    "however , when considering the new constraints on the reionization optical depth from planck hfi data @xcite , the lower value preferred by that data on the neutrino effective number @xmath21 restores the tension on @xmath3 between the datasets and the standard value for @xmath21 is recovered .",
    "the most recent data ( given the @xmath50 ) therefore does not really lend support to the power - law inflation model with dark radiation .",
    "we would like to thank s. galli , t. tram and v. vennin for stimulating discussions .",
