    "the relationship between information and physics has been an intriguing problem for many years @xcite .",
    "it took a new twist with the emergence of quantum information theory whose paradigm  information is physical \" @xcite added a new point of view to old questions .",
    "quantum information theory usually involves only a nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "however , both for the sake of logical completeness and in order to derive physical bounds on information transfer , its processing , and the errors involved , a full relativistic treatment is required .",
    "additional motivation to relativistic extensions of quantum information theory comes from quantum cosmology .",
    "quantum field theory in curved spacetime , and black hole physics in particular , present challenges that everybody who upholds the principle that ",
    "information is physical \" should respond to .",
    "techniques of quantum information theory can be applied to field theory and black hole physics @xcite . in this presentation",
    "we describe some of the new features of quantum information theory when the effects of special relativity are taken into account .",
    "the concept of reduced density matrix is fundamental for quantum information .",
    "its properties are significantly modified when we deal with relativistic effects .",
    "let us use latin indices for the description of a subsystem which is excluded from our description , and greek indices for the subsystem that we can actually describe .",
    "the components of a state vector would thus be written @xmath0 and those of a density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the system of interest is given by _",
    "= _ m , n _",
    "m , n . [ tau ] even if @xmath2 is a pure state ( a matrix of rank one ) , @xmath3 is in general a mixed state .",
    "its _ entropy _ is defined as s=- ( ) .",
    "an important consequence of relativity is that there is a hierarchy of dynamical variables : _ primary variables _ have relativistic transformation laws that depend only on the lorentz transformation matrix @xmath4 that acts on the spacetime coordinates .",
    "for example , momentum components are primary variables . on the other hand , _ secondary variables _ such as spin and polarization have transformation laws that depend not only on @xmath4 , but also on the momentum of the particle . as a consequence ,",
    "the reduced density matrix for secondary variables , which may be well defined in any coordinate system , has no transformation law relating its components in different lorentz frames .",
    "a simple example will be given below .",
    "moreover , an unambiguous definition of the reduced density matrix by means of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) is possible only if the secondary degrees of freedom are unconstrained .",
    "for gauge field theories , that equation may be meaningless if it conflicts with constraints imposed on the physical states @xcite . in the absence of a general prescription ,",
    "a case - by - case treatment is required . a particular construction , valid with respect to a certain class of tests ,",
    "is given in sec .",
    "[ photons ] . a general way of defining reduced density matrices for physical states in gauge theories is an open problem .",
    "the next two sections present detailed calculations and explore implications for distinguishability of quantum states and their entanglement . in the last section",
    "we show that a description of quantum channels by means of completely positive maps @xcite is only an approximation .",
    "we first consider the relativistic properties of the spin entropy for a single , free particle of spin  and mass @xmath5 . for massive particles",
    "a reduced density matrix is well - defined , but it has no invariant meaning @xcite .",
    "the reason is that under a lorentz boost , the spin undergoes a wigner rotation @xcite whose direction and magnitude depend on the momentum of the particle .",
    "even if the initial state is a direct product of a function of momentum and a function of spin , the transformed state is not a direct product .",
    "spin and momentum become entangled .",
    "the quantum state of a spin-  particle can be written , in the momentum representation , as a two - component spinor , ( ) = a_1()a_2 ( ) , [ psi0 ] where the amplitudes @xmath6 satisfy @xmath7 .",
    "the normalization of these amplitudes is a matter of convenience , depending on whether we prefer to include a factor in it , or to have such factors in the transformation law ( [ tf ] ) below .",
    "here we shall use the second alternative , because it is closer to the nonrelativistic notation which appears in the usual definition of entropy .",
    "we emphasize that we consider normalizable states , in the momentum representation , not momentum eigenstates as usual in textbooks on particle physics .",
    "the latter are chiefly concerned with the computation of @xmath8 matrix elements needed to obtain cross sections and other asymptotic properties . however , in general a particle has no definite momentum .",
    "for example , if an electron is elastically scattered by some target , the electron state after the scattering is a superposition that involves momenta in all directions . in that case",
    ", it still is formally possible to ask , in any lorentz frame , what is the value of a spin component in a given direction ( this is a legitimate hermitian operator ) .",
    "let us define a reduced density matrix , @xmath9 , giving statistical predictions for the results of measurements of spin components by an ideal apparatus which is not affected by the momentum of the particle .",
    "the spin entropy is s=-()=-_j_j , where @xmath10 are the eigenvalues of @xmath3 .    as usual",
    ", ignoring some degrees of freedom leaves the others in a mixed state .",
    "what is not obvious is that in the present case the amount of mixing depends on the lorentz frame used by the observer . indeed consider another observer ( bob ) who moves with a constant velocity with respect to alice who prepared state ( [ psi0 ] )",
    ". in the lorentz frame where bob is at rest",
    ", the same spin-  particle has a state ()=a_1()a_2 ( ) . the transformation law is a()=[(^-1p)_0/p_0]^1/2_s d_rs[,(^-1p)]a_s(^-1p ) [ tf ] , where @xmath11 is the wigner rotation matrix for a lorentz transformation @xmath4 @xcite .    as an example , take a particle prepared by alice with spin in the @xmath12 direction , so that @xmath13 , and a_1()=n(-^2/2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath14 is a normalization factor .",
    "spin and momentum are not entangled , and the spin entropy is zero .",
    "when that particle is described in bob s lorentz frame , moving with velocity @xmath15 in a direction at an angle @xmath16 with alice s @xmath12-axis , a detailed calculation shows that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonzero , so that the spin entropy is positive @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated in fig .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a relevant parameter , apart from the angle @xmath16 , is in the leading order in momentum spread , = , where @xmath19 is the momentum spread in alice s frame . _",
    "the entropy has no invariant meaning _ , because the reduced density matrix @xmath3 has no covariant transformation law , except in the limiting case of sharp momenta .",
    "only the complete density matrix transforms covariantly .",
    "= 0.48    it is noteworthy that a similar situation arises for a classical system whose state is given in any lorentz frame by a liouville function @xcite .",
    "recall that a liouville function expresses our probabilistic description of a classical system  what we can predict before we perform an actual observation  just as a quantum state is a mathematical expression used for computing probabilities of events .",
    "consider now a pair of orthogonal states that were prepared by alice .",
    "how well can moving bob distinguish them ?",
    "we shall use the simplest criterion , namely the probability of error @xmath20 , defined as follows : an observer receives a single copy of one of the two known states and performs any operation permitted by quantum theory in order to decide which state was supplied .",
    "the probability of a wrong answer for an optimal measurement is @xcite p_e(_1,_2)=-tr .",
    "[ pe ] in alice s frame @xmath21 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in bob s frame , @xmath22 , where the proportionality factor depends on the angle @xmath16 defined above .",
    "an interesting problem is the relativistic nature of quantum entanglement when there are several particles . for two particles ,",
    "an invariant definition of the entanglement of their spins would be to compute it in the lorentz `` rest frame '' where @xmath23 .",
    "however , this simple definition is not adequate when there are more than two particles , because there appears a problem of cluster decomposition : each subset of particles may have a different rest frame .",
    "this is a difficult problem , still awaiting for a solution .",
    "we shall mention only a few partial results .    alsing and",
    "milburn @xcite considered bipartite states with well - defined momenta .",
    "they showed that while lorentz transformations change the appearance of the state in different inertial frames and the spin directions are wigner rotated , the amount of entanglement remains intact .",
    "the reason is that lorentz boosts do not create spin - momentum entanglement when acting on eigenstates of momentum , and the transformations on the pair are implemented on both particles as local unitary transformations which are known to preserve the entanglement .",
    "the same conclusion is also valid for photon pairs .",
    "however , realistic situations involve wave packets .",
    "for example , a general spin-@xmath24 two - particle state may be written as    d(p)= , is a lorentz - invariant measure .",
    "for particles with well defined momenta , @xmath25 is sharply peaked at some values @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "again , a boost to any lorentz frame @xmath28 will result in a unitary @xmath29 , acting on each particle separately , thus preserving the entanglement .",
    "however , if the momenta are not sharp , so that the spin - momentum entanglement is frame dependent , then the spin - spin entanglement is frame - dependent as well .",
    "gingrich and adami @xcite investigated the reduced density matrix for @xmath30 and made explicit calculations for the case where @xmath25 is a gaussian , as in @xcite .",
    "they showed that if two particles are maximally entangled in a common ( approximate ) rest frame ( alice s frame ) , then the degree of entanglement , as seen by a lorentz - boosted bob , decreases when the boost parameter @xmath31 .",
    "of course , the inverse transformation from bob to alice will increase the entanglement .",
    "thus , we see that that spin - spin entanglement is not a lorentz invariant quantity , exactly as spin entropy is not a lorentz scalar .",
    "relativistic effects that we describe in this section are essentially different from those for massive particles that were discussed above , because photons have only two linearly independent polarization states . the properties that we discuss are kinematical , not dynamical . at the statistical level",
    ", it is not even necessary to involve quantum electrodynamics .",
    "most formulae can be derived by elementary classical methods @xcite .",
    "it is only when we consider individual photons , for cryptographic applications , that quantum theory becomes essential .",
    "the diffraction effects mentioned above lead to superselection rules which make it impossible to define a reduced density matrix for polarization . as shown below ,",
    "it is still possible to have `` effective '' density matrices ; however , the latter depend not only on the preparation process , but also on the method of detection that is used by the observer .    in applications to secure communication",
    ", the ideal scenario is that isolated photons ( one particle fock states ) are emitted . in a more realistic setup ,",
    "the transmission is by means of weak coherent pulses containing on the average less than one photon each .",
    "a basis of the one - photon space is spanned by states of definite momentum and helicity ,    @xmath32 , and helicity states @xmath33 are explicitly defined by eq .",
    "( [ helivectors ] ) below .    as we know",
    ", polarization is a _ secondary variable _ : states that correspond to different momenta belong to distinct hilbert spaces and can not be superposed ( an expression such as @xmath34 is meaningless if @xmath35 ) .",
    "the complete basis ( [ basis ] ) does not violate this superselection rule , owing to the othogonality of the momentum basis .",
    "therefore , a generic one - photon state is given by a wave packet    @xmath36 , and normalized states satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "the generic polarization state @xmath38 corresponds to the geometrical 3-vector ( ) = _ + ( ) ^+_+_-()^- _ , [ elliptic ] where @xmath39 , and the explicit form of @xmath40 is given below .",
    "lorentz transformations of quantum states are most easily computed by referring to some standard momentum , which for photons is @xmath41 . accordingly , standard right and left circular polarization vectors are @xmath42 . for _ linear _ polarization , we take eq .",
    "( [ elliptic ] ) with @xmath43 , so that the 3-vectors @xmath44 are real . in general ,",
    "complex @xmath44 correspond to elliptic polarization .    under a lorentz transformation @xmath4 ,",
    "these states become @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the spatial part of a four - vector @xmath47 , and the new polarization vector can be obtained by an appropriate rotation @xcite ( _ ) = r(_)r()^-1 ( ) , where @xmath48 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath49 .",
    "finally , for each @xmath49 a polarization basis is labeled by the helicity vectors , ^_=r()^_p .",
    "[ helivectors ]    let us try to define a reduced density matrix in the usual way , = d()|f(k)|^2|,(),()| ?",
    "the superselection rule that was mentioned above does not forbid this definition , because only terms with the same momentum @xmath49 are summed .",
    "however , since polarization is a secondary variable , this object can not have definite transformation properties under boosts .",
    "this deficiency is familiar to us from the analysis of reduced density matrices of massive particles .",
    "however , for massless particles , the situation is worse : povms that are given by @xmath50 matrices represent measurement devices and should transform under a representation of the rotation group o(3 ) . on the other hand , even for the complete photon state , ordinary rotations of the reference frame correspond to elements of e(2 ) , so that probabilities would not be invariant under rotations .",
    "therefore , let us find a more physical definition of a reduced density matrix for polarization @xcite .",
    "the labelling of polarization states by euclidean vectors @xmath51 suggests the use of a @xmath52 matrix with entries labelled @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath12 .",
    "classically , they correspond to different directions of the electric field .",
    "for example , a reduced density matrix @xmath55 would give the expectation values of operators representing the polarization in the @xmath53 direction , seemingly irrespective of the particle s momentum .    to have a momentum - independent polarization",
    "is to tacitly admit longitudinal photons .",
    "unphysical concepts are often used in intermediate steps in theoretical physics .",
    "momentum - independent polarization states thus consist of physical ( transversal ) and unphysical ( longitudinal ) parts , the latter corresponding to a polarization vector @xmath56 .",
    "for example , a generalized polarization state along the @xmath53-axis is |=x_+()|^+_+x_-()|^-_+ x_()|^_,[decomp ] where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "it follows that @xmath59 , and we thus define _ x()= [ physdir ] , as the polarization vector associated with the @xmath53 direction .",
    "it follows from ( [ decomp ] ) that @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and likewise for other directions , so that ||+||+||=_p,[xyz ] where @xmath62 is the unit operator in momentum space .",
    "we can now define an  effective \" reduced density matrix adapted to a specific method of measuring polarization , as follows @xcite . to the direction",
    "@xmath63 corresponds a projection operator p_x=||_p=||d(k)|| , the action of @xmath64 on @xmath65 follows from eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) and @xmath66 .",
    "only the transversal part of @xmath67 appears in the expectation value :    the transversal part of @xmath67 as |_x ( ) ( |^+_^+_|+|^-_^-_|)| + = x_+()|^+_+x_-()|^-_. [ vector ] likewise define @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these three state vectors are neither of unit length nor mutually orthogonal . for @xmath70",
    "we have |_x ( ) = c(,)|,_x ( ) , where @xmath71 is given by eq .",
    "( [ physdir ] ) , and @xmath72 .",
    "finally , a povm element @xmath73 which is the physical part of @xmath64 , namely is equivalent to @xmath64 for physical states ( without longitudinal photons ) is e_x = d(k)|,_x(),_x()| , and likewise for other directions .",
    "the operators @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 indeed form a povm in the space of physical states , owing to eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) .",
    "the above derivation was , admittedly , a rather circuitous route for obtaining a povm for polarization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the latter is a secondary variable , subject to superselection rules .",
    "unfortunately , this is the generic situation .    to complete the construction of the density matrix ,",
    "we introduce additional directions . similarly to a standard practice of channel matrices reconstruction @xcite , we consider @xmath76 , @xmath77 and similar combinations .",
    "for example , e_x+z , x+z=(|+|)(|+|)_p .",
    "let us denote @xmath78 as @xmath79 , even though this is not a positive operator .",
    "we then get a simple expression for the reduced density matrix corresponding to the polarization state @xmath38 : _ mn=|e_mn|= + d(k)|f()|^2()|_m()_n()| ( ) , [ reduced ] where @xmath80 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this derivation gives a direct physical meaning to the naive definition of a reduced density matrix , ^naive_mn = d()|f(k)|^2_m()_n^ * ( ) = _ mn    our basis states @xmath81 are direct products of momentum and polarization . owing to the transversality requirement @xmath82 , they remain direct products under lorentz transformations .",
    "all the other states have their polarization and momentum degrees of freedom entangled . as a result , if one is restricted to polarization measurements as described by the above povm , _ there do not exist two orthogonal polarization states_. an immediate corollary is that photon polarization states can not be cloned perfectly , because the no - cloning theorem @xcite forbids an exact copying of unknown non - orthogonal states . in general , any measurement procedure with finite momentum sensitivity will lead to the errors in identification .",
    "first we present some general considerations and then illustrate them with a simple example .",
    "let us take the @xmath12-axis to coincide with the average direction of propagation so that the mean photon momentum is @xmath83 .",
    "typically , the spread in momentum is small , but not necessarily equal in all directions .",
    "usually the intensity profile of laser beams has cylindrical symmetry , and we may assume that @xmath84 where the index @xmath85 means radial .",
    "we may also assume that @xmath86 .",
    "we then have f()f_1[(k_z - k_a)/_z]f_2(k_r/_r ) .",
    "we approximate k_r / k_zk_r / k_a .",
    "[ theta ] in pictorial language , polarization planes for different momenta are tilted by angles up to @xmath87 , so that we expect an error probability of the order @xmath88 . in the density matrix @xmath89",
    "all the elements of the form @xmath90 should vanish when @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath92 , the non - vanishing @xmath93 block goes to the usual ( monochromatic ) polarization density matrix . as an example we consider two states which",
    ", if the momentum spread could be ignored , would be @xmath94 .",
    "to simplify the calculations we assume a gaussian distribution : f()=ne^-(k_z - k_a)^2/2_z^2e^-k_r^2/2_r^2 , where @xmath14 is a normalization factor and @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , we take the polarization components to be @xmath96 .",
    "that means we have to analyze the states |_=d ( ) f()|^_,[st ] , where @xmath97 is given above .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in the leading order p_e(_+,_-)=_r^2/4k_a^2 .",
    "now we turn to the distinguishability problem from the point of view of a moving observer , bob . the probability of an error by bob is still given by eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) .",
    "the distinguishability of polarization density matrices depends on the observer s motion .",
    "we again assume that bob moves along the @xmath12-axis with a velocity @xmath98 .",
    "detailed calculations @xcite show that p_e = p_e , [ dope ] which may be either larger or smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "as expected , we obtain for one - photon states the same doppler effect as in the classical calculations @xcite .    since maximally entangled states are pure , the fact that all polarization density matrices are mixed implies that maximal epr - type correlations shall never be observed , and that maximal attainable value will depend on the momentum spread of the states .",
    "although reduced polarization density matrices have no general transformation rule , the above results show that such rules can be established for particular classes of experimental procedures .",
    "we can then ask how these effective transformation rules , @xmath99 , fit into the framework of general state transformations .",
    "equation  ( [ chanex ] ) gives an example of such a transformation .",
    "=(1-)+(_x_x+_y_y ) . [ chanex ]",
    "it relates the reduced density matrix @xmath2 , obtained from alice s eq .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) , to bob s density matrix @xmath100 .",
    "this particular transformation is completely positive ; however , it is not so in general .",
    "it can be proved that distinguishability , as expressed by natural measures like @xmath20 , can not be improved by any completely positive transformation @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the complete positivity requirement may fail if there is a prior entanglement with another system @xcite . since in the two previous sections we have seen that distinguishability _ can _ be improved ,",
    "we conclude that these transformations are _ not completely positive_. the reason is that the lorentz transformation acts not only on the `` interesting '' discrete variables , but also on the `` hidden '' momentum variables that we elected to ignore and to trace out , and its action on the interesting degrees of freedom depends on the hidden ones .",
    "this technicality has one important consequence .",
    "the notion of a _ channel _ is fundamental both in classical and quantum communication theory .",
    "quantum channels are described as completely positive maps that act on qubit states @xcite .",
    "qubits themselves are realized as particles discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "if relativistic motion is important , then not only does the vacuum behave as a noisy quantum channel , but the very representation of a channel by a completely positive map fails @xcite .",
