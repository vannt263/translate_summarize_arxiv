    "the shape of the milky way rotation curve is indicative not only of the integrated mass within a radius , but also of the local mass distribution and physical environment .",
    "the change in the rotation curve with distance from the plane can tell us about the gravitational potential of the disk as well as which physical processes affect the gas kinematics .",
    "previous studies of h i near the plane assumed that the rotation velocity was constant up to @xmath3 kpc @xcite ; in this paper we test that assumption .    in other galaxies , the falloff of the halo gas rotation curve with distance from the plane",
    "is well established , having been observed in h i ( ngc 891 : @xcite and @xcite , ngc 2403 : @xcite , ngc 5775 : @xcite ) , h@xmath4 ( ngc 891 : @xcite , ngc 5775 : @xcite and @xcite ) , and x - rays @xcite",
    ". a recent study of the galactic halos of ngc 891 , 4302 , and 5775 using h @xmath4 found that the decrease in the rotation curve with scale height was a nearly constant @xmath015 to @xmath025 km s@xmath2 per scale height across the three galaxies @xcite . in the milky way , observations of an ophiuchus superbubble in h i and h @xmath4 at galactic longitude @xmath5 and 3.4 kpc above the plane showed gas that lags 27 km s@xmath2 behind the rotation at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "halo gas motions are likely to be dominated by complex physics , such as a galactic fountain @xcite where gas is pushed off of the disk , moves through the halo , and then returns to the disk .",
    "@xcite summarized several different mechanisms of establishing a vertical falloff in the rotation speed , including radial pressure gradients and magnetic tension .",
    "nearer to the plane in the milky way h i disk , fluctuations in the velocity structure associated with spiral arms were first observed by @xcite .",
    "these were termed `` rolling motions '' because on one side of the plane there is a positive shift in the tangent velocity , and on the other side the shift is towards more negative velocities .",
    "@xcite tried to explain the rolling motions as purely a geometric effect , but later work showed that this could not be true in all cases @xcite . rolling motions have also been observed in other spiral arm tracers , such as co @xcite and stars @xcite .",
    "note that it is difficult to detect similar phenomena in the disks of external galaxies because @xmath7 pc spatial resolution and @xmath3 km s@xmath2 velocity resolution are necessary .    in principle ,",
    "it is simple to extract the rotation structure of the inner galaxy from the tangent velocities of gas at different longitudes @xcite ; for each longitude , just find the velocity where emission has fallen off .",
    "however , this task is complicated by several factors that obfuscate the determination of the tangent velocity , including velocity dispersion due to random motion of the gas , bulk flows often associated with spiral density waves @xcite , and noncircular motions , whether due to the galactic bar @xcite or some other cause .",
    "nevertheless , h i spectra have been used to measure the inner galaxy rotation curve for more than half a century .",
    "early studies also uncovered a large - scale asymmetry between inner galaxy rotation curves on either side of the galactic center @xcite , which may be a sign of a triaxial density distribution @xcite .",
    "much attention has been paid to bumps in the rotation curve as a function of radius @xcite , but comparatively little analysis has been done on the fluctuations above and below the plane .    in this paper , we measure the inner galaxy rotation structure close to the plane using 21 cm emission from h i gas . for the first time , we allow the rotation curve to vary with height off the plane as well as with galactocentric radius .",
    "we generalize the existing rotation curve formalism to include variation in the rotation speed as a function of height off the plane . to accomplish this , we need two coordinate systems .",
    "the first is centered at the lsr , with coordinates galactic longitude @xmath8 , galactic latitude @xmath9 , and line - of - sight velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the second is a cylindrical coordinate system with the origin at the galactic center , radial coordinate @xmath11 , and height off the plane @xmath12 .",
    "analysis of the gas at the tangent points is straightforward because , unlike the rest of the inner galaxy , distance determinations in these areas do not suffer from the distance ambiguity .",
    "furthermore , simple geometric relations can be used to calculate the galactocentric radius of a tangent point , @xmath13 , and the height of gas at a tangent point , @xmath14 . since this mapping is one - to - one at a tangent point , we use these two coordinate systems interchangeably .",
    "we assume @xmath15 , the distance from the sun to the galactic center , is 8.5 kpc .    assuming circular rotation , the relation for line - of - sight velocity is given by @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the rotation speed of the lsr ( which we assume to be 220 km s@xmath2 ) , and we have generalized to a rotation curve that varies with height off the galactic plane , @xmath18 .",
    "we assume cylindrical non - intersecting gas orbits , with no velocity in the @xmath12 direction . at the tangent points",
    ", we then reduce eqn .",

    "for the longitudes @xmath24 , we used the 21 cm h i vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ) data @xcite to find the tangent velocities as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath9 .",
    "the vgps is a combination of interferometric vla observations with single - dish observations from the green bank telescope .",
    "the data have a velocity resolution of 1.56 km s@xmath2 , an angular resolution of 1 , and an rms noise level of 2 k. the @xmath9 coverage varies with longitude ; near @xmath26 the data are restricted to @xmath27 , while around @xmath28 the range is @xmath29 .",
    "these data have a higher angular resolution than that of the leiden",
    "/ argentine / bonn survey , @xmath30 @xcite ; the better angular resolution provides the necessary resolution in @xmath12 .    for the southern longitudes",
    "@xmath31 , we used the 21 cm h i southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) data @xcite .",
    "the sgps is a combination of interferometric observations with the australia telescope compact array with single - dish observations from the parkes radio telescope .",
    "these data have a velocity resolution of 0.8 km s@xmath2 , an angular resolution of @xmath322 , and an rms noise level of @xmath321.6 k. the sgps is limited to @xmath33 , but to avoid edge effects associated with the interferometer coverage we further restricted to @xmath34 .",
    "to reduce these surveys to a more manageable size and minimize the impact of instrumental noise and small galactic perturbations , we broke the data into @xmath35 segments in @xmath8 and , for each segment , we constructed a composite spectrum by taking the median value of the brightness temperature at each velocity and for each @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure reduced the number of data points in @xmath8 while preserving the sampling in @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we use this smaller data set for the remainder of this paper .    finally , we restrict to lines - of - sight with @xmath36 pc , to insure that each longitude has nearly uniform coverage in @xmath12 .",

    "[ sec : syserr ] .",
    "these cuts leave us with 37396 spectra in the north and 22897 spectra in the south within the range 3 kpc @xmath37 kpc .",
    "various methods have been used to determine @xmath23 for an h i spectra .",
    "for example , @xcite chose the velocity where the profile crosses the 10 k threshold , @xcite chose the velocity of the first maximum in the spectra , @xcite used the velocity where the brightness temperature crosses half the maximum , and @xcite calculated @xmath23 using the integral of the spectrum past the first maximum .",
    "even the best of these methods requires correction , as modeling shows that the equivalent width velocity or the half max velocity differs from the actual tangent velocity by @xmath38 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "also , functions such as gaussians @xcite and error functions @xcite have been fit to the emission falloff . in general , methods that rely on curve - fitting or the integral of the profile are more reliable than methods that depend solely on a temperature threshold or peak location because they will be less sensitive to instrumental noise and perturbations in the h i gas density and velocity .    assuming that the disk has a uniform number density @xmath39 and a spin temperature @xmath40",
    ", @xcite derived that the optical depth line profile close to the tangent velocity has the following form : @xmath41dw\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath44 is a function that parameterizes the amplitude of the line , and @xmath45 is the oort constant evaluated at the tangent point .",
    "the shape of the profile depends only on the velocity dispersion and the tangent velocity of the gas ; other parameters such as the density and shape of the rotation curve affect the amplitude .",
    "we convert from @xmath46 to brightness temperature @xmath47 by assuming the spin temperature is 155 k everywhere , larger than the highest @xmath47 in our data set .",
    "@xcite further refined eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fit ] ) by allowing the kinematics of the gas to deviate from circular symmetry and adding in radial motions ; for the purposes of this paper , such a high level of detail is not necessary .",
    "the irregular shape of many profiles sometimes makes it difficult to choose which peak should be fit with eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fit ] ) ; @xcite were forced to fit spectra interactively , determining the limits for each fit by eye .",
    "we use a more objective technique : first , we smooth each spectra with a 4 km s@xmath2 boxcar window .",
    "next , we find the location of the first local maximum in the smoothed spectra with a brightness temp larger than 10 k ; we call this velocity @xmath48",
    ". we then fit the original spectrum with eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fit ] ) using a levenberg - marquardt non - linear least squares fitting routine with three free parameters : @xmath23 , amplitude , and @xmath43 .",
    "we include in this fit data from velocities in the range @xmath49 for qi and @xmath50 for qiv .",
    "these limits were optimized by minimizing the errors in parameters determined from our models , described below in  [ sec : syserr ] .",
    "the fits are generally a good match to the emission spectra . however , there are some exceptions .",
    "some spectra are too irregular for the fitting routine to converge on a physically reasonable solution ; an intermediate velocity cloud can fall in the range of fitted velocities , or there can be a particularly large bulk flow that distorts the shape of the spectrum . in cases like these , @xmath23 found by the fit often falls outside the velocity boundaries of the fit .",
    "when this happens , we flag the spectra at that @xmath51 and remove its @xmath23 from the rest of the analysis .",

    "[ fig : sgpsvtan ] for qiv .",
    "maps on both sides of the sun - galactic center line show the expected large scale trend of lower @xmath53 at larger @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath23 surfaces are fairly smooth with a few small pockmarks . in a system with no change in the rotation curve with @xmath12",
    ", the contours in these maps would be nearly parallel to the @xmath12 axis , since @xmath54 .",
    "this is clearly not the case in many regions ; for one example , examine the @xmath55 km s@xmath2 contour in the southern map , which shows evidence for a @xmath56 term .",
    "many contours in the @xmath57 km s@xmath2 to 90 km s@xmath2 range appear several hundred pc closer to the galactic center in qiv compared to qi ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : combine ] ) .",
    "this could result from a genuine asymmetry in the qi / qiv rotation curves @xcite , deviations from the axial symmetry of the potential , or from bulk flows and other peculiar motions .        in figs .",
    "[ fig : vgpsplots ] and [ fig : sgpsplots ] , we plot the tangent velocity on top of @xmath47 contours for several @xmath8 .",
    "note that the tangent velocity points do not simply follow a single brightness temperature contour ; in general , they are at lower @xmath47 for larger @xmath12 , because the overall amplitude of the spectra decreases away from the plane as the density falls off . on the velocity scale of these figures the @xmath23 are quite regular , albeit with a few outliers .              the tangent velocity surface should be a smooth function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but the surfaces derived in  [ sec : fit ] have discontinuous bumps .",

    "we flagged this region by hand and removed it from the analysis .",
    "to model the global rotation curve , we extended a linear rotation curve explored in @xcite by adding two vertical derivative terms : @xmath78 the global rolling motion is given by @xmath79 , and the global falloff from the plane by @xmath80 . throughout this paper ,",

    "also , the stepsize in @xmath9 in qi is smaller than in qiv , so qi would have a larger influence on a combined fit .",
    "furthermore , although there are more than a hundred spectra at each longitude , many of the derived tangent velocities are not independent .",
