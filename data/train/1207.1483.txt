    "recent experimental results from the groups of m. oberthaler and p. treutlein have provided compelling evidence of the generation of spin - squeezed states in bosonic josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "two different setups with ultracold @xmath0rb bosons have been explored : a ) a cloud trapped in an external double - well potential  @xcite ( external bjj ) and b ) a cloud of atoms in two different hyperfine states trapped in a single harmonic potential with a linear coupling between the two internal states  @xcite ( internal bjj ) . in both the internal and external josephson junctions , the experimental setups were able to reproduce to a large extent the well - known two - site bose - hubbard ( bh ) model  @xcite , a lipkin - meshkov - glick - like ( lmg ) hamiltonian  @xcite . in this way , the experiments confirmed the predicted existence of strongly squeezed spin states  @xcite and , correspondingly , of large sets of entangled pseudo - spins  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , and due to the need to control and implement quantum resources , there has been an increasing interest in developing fast protocols to shortcut adiabatic following  @xcite .",
    "the key purpose is to engineer procedures to drive , in a finite time , a system from some initial state to a final state that could be reached with an adiabatic , slow process .",
    "the different protocols may in addition aim at minimizing the transient energy excitations , reducing the sensitivity to noise , or minimizing other variables of interest  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , the initial and final states are not necessarily required to be the ground states ( gss ) of the system . in this work , however , we concentrate on transitions between ground states corresponding to different values of the model parameters which can be controlled externally . the proposed method is designed so that the desired final state is produced as a stationary eigenstate of the hamiltonian , with no need to freeze the dynamics .",
    "analytical formulas to perform this type of processes exist for the harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "in this article we demonstrate that these methods can also be employed to produce the highly - correlated many - body quantum states described by the bh hamiltonian , such as squeezed states , broadening the current state - of - the - art which has so far dealt only with condensed cold gases  @xcite .",
    "to do so , we benefit from the explicit mapping , in the large @xmath1 limit , between the two - site bose - hubbard model and an effective single particle system described by a schrdinger - like equation  @xcite . as will be shown , this connection allows us to use methods which were originally developed for single - particle dynamics , to shortcut the adiabatic following in a many - body problem . as a figure of merit",
    ", the methods proposed would allow to prepare highly number - squeezed states in roughly half the time needed in the experimental setup of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our proposal presents important differences with respect to the recent work of ref .",
    "we target the formation of spin - squeezed states while  @xcite uses optimal control theory ( oct ) to produce cat - like states . in our method , the final state of the system is the ground state , with no need to stop or freeze the dynamics , while in  @xcite a stoppage is required once the desired state is reached .",
    "also , as detailed below , our method to shortcut the adiabatic evolution is very robust , only requiring high precision control during the initial and final times .",

    "this has been experimentally achieved already in an atom - chip experiment  @xcite . in the experiments of the heidelberg group",
    "one would need to track the resonance of the linear coupling ( responsible for the hopping term in the hamiltonian ) which is altered due to the second order zeeman shift when @xmath17 is varied .",

    "our method for fast adiabatic - like preparation of a given ground state requires control of the atom - atom interaction at time scales of fractions of the rabi time . in what follows",

    "the fact that these can be fulfilled by an infinite set of @xmath65 , has two important consequences : 1 ) this freedom allows to apply tools of optimal control theory ( oct ) to produce @xmath65 s which ensure fidelity 1 and satisfy other constraints .",

    "2 ) the method is extremely robust : in an experimental realization aiming at a final fidelity equal to 1 , the success is guaranteed provided the frictionless conditions are satisfied , with no need to have a precise control during the intermediate evolution  @xcite .",
    "this is an important advantage with respect to other protocols , e.g.  the ones considered in ref .",

    "our calculations confirm that our method , although not exact , is extremely accurate in the many - body simulations despite the fact that it was derived for the single particle problem in a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "this is due to the validity of the explained mapping of the bh to the single particle pseudo - schrdinger equation , which turns out to be well approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential .",

[ fig1 ] . for both @xmath58 we present the results of the corresponding instantaneous ground state of the many - body system for comparison .",
    "first , we note that the sc does produce a final result which has the same coherence @xmath81 and coherent number squeezing @xmath57 as the corresponding adiabatically evolved case . in contrast , the linearly ramped system deviates notably from the adiabatically evolved state at the final time . as we are considering fairly long times ,",

    "@xcite for a particle in a harmonic oscillator and ultrafast adiabatic evolution , the method presented requires a certain period of the evolution where the trapping potential is actually reversed into an expelling potential ( an inverted parabola ) . through the previously explained mapping , this corresponds in our many - body bh problem to a period of time where the atom - atom interaction is switched from repulsive to attractive , @xmath88 . for attractive interactions",
