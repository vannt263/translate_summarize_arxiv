    "big bang cosmology is an excellent model to describe our universe @xcite . albeit its success there is still puzzling `` lithium problem '' @xcite in its building block  big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "namely the theoretical predicted primordial @xmath0li abundance is higher than observation while the @xmath1li abundance is lower .",
    "primordial @xmath0li abundance from measurements of metal - poor halo stars is @xmath0li / h@xmath6 @xcite-@xcite , while prediction by the standard bbn ( sbbn ) model is three to five times higher : @xmath0li / h@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "abundance from observation is @xmath1li / h@xmath8 @xcite , a factor of about 1000 higher than the sbbn model prediction @xcite .",
    "extensive investigations have focused on lithium problem .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to astrophysical origin @xcite . while it is also possible that the discrepancy is arising from physics beyond the sbbn model .",
    "investigations showed that lithium abundance would change by varying the nucleon effective couplings as well as the mass parameters , namely the neutron lifetime , the neutron - proton mass difference and the deuteron binding energy etc .",
    "these parameters can be modified due to virtual effects of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "another possibility of physics beyond the sbbn could contain new particles / resonances .",
    "such new particles / resonances participate in thermal nuclear reactions during bbn @xcite-@xcite , as such lithium abundance will depend on the detail assumptions about the new particles / resonances .",
    "besides these two approaches , non - thermal electromagnetic @xcite and hadronic @xcite-@xcite energy injection was also investigated .",
    "non - thermal particles originate from the nuclear reactions before the final state particles are thermalized .",
    "the preliminary studies showed that the mono - energetic injection is hardly the origin of lithium problem . in this paper",
    "we will extend , in some sense , such idea to include the non - thermal energy injection from cosmic rays during and/or shortly after the epoch of bbn .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a possible solution to the lithium problem by not going far from the sbbn model , neither due to the astrophysical factors nor by introduction of new particles . in order to destroy @xmath0li ,",
    "the relic primordial @xmath0li mainly ( about @xmath9 ) comes from the decay of @xmath0be .",
    "] we include new contributions from non - thermal particles , namely the accelerated sbbn particles . as is known that the non - thermal particles accelerated in astrophysical environment today are called cosmic rays , it is expected there is such cosmic rays even in the early stage of bbn .",
    "we expect that some kind of plasma wave or other mechanisms can feed energy to thermal ions @xcite , provided that there is strong enough turbulence before / during bbn epoch . as a consequence the particle energy spectrum deviates from thermal distribution .",
    "exploring detailed mechanism on how to induce non - thermal component is beyond the scope of this paper and which will be the focus of the further work .",
    "however we propose a toy model to support our basic hypothesis in this paper .",
    "the primordial magnetic fields might be created at some early stage of the evolution of the universe , for example inflation , the electro - weak phase transition , quark - hadron phase transition and so on . as investigated by authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , after electro - weak phase transition the magnetic field build up and evolve with the expanding universe .",
    "we can estimate the strength of induced electric field through @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic magnetic field , @xmath12 is the expansion rate as inverse of the characteristic time , and @xmath13 is the characteristic length of turbulence which is given by equations ( 47 ) and ( 49 ) of @xcite ( here @xmath14 which includes the effect of cosmic expansion ) . using the same initial parameters as in ref . @xcite and extrapolating to @xmath15 , we get the induced electric field @xmath16 v / m in plasma with temperature @xmath15",
    ". a charged particle like proton undergoing such electric field will gain energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the particle velocity parallel to the electric field , @xmath19 is the electric charge of the particle , and @xmath20 is the thermalization time of a high energy ( of order mev ) nuclear in plasma of temperature @xmath21 . for o(mev ) protons in plasma of temperature @xmath15 , @xmath22 s @xcite , the possible energy gain of an accelerated thermal proton is of order 0.1 mev .",
    "during one free time , a proton can travel a distance of @xmath23 @xmath24s @xmath25 cm ( @xmath26 is the light velocity ) which is just several percent of the characteristic length scale .",
    "protons have the opportunity to be accelerated several times and thus to gain a couple of mev energy , though the probability is low .",
    "thus we can expect the energy spectrum of high energy particles will not be too hard .",
    "this proposed toy model needs hydro - magnetic turbulence as the premise .",
    "we do nt know exactly how hydro - magnetic turbulence develops during the bbn . however according to ref .",
    "@xcite , helical hydromagnetic turbulence survives until 100 ev .",
    "we found that the correlation length and magnetic field will be larger if we adopt model in ref .",
    "@xcite instead .",
    "therefore there should be a considerable parameter space to support our hypothesis .",
    "in this paper we will examine phenomenologically whether such scenario can account for lithium problem .",
    "these non - thermal particles are dubbed as bbn cosmic rays ( bbncrs ) . in the sbbn conventional abundance calculation ,",
    "the exothermic reactions are included .",
    "bbncrs contributions to the exothermic sbbn reactions will be investigated .",
    "most importantly , we have to include the endothermic reactions in order to destroy @xmath0be by bbncrs . in the sbbn ,",
    "the endothermic reactions are thought not important .",
    "this paper proceeds as following . in section [ bbncrs and reactions ]",
    "we describe the required characteristics of bbncrs , namely the particle species , the energy range and energy spectrum and so on .",
    "there are many reactions involving bbncrs so we need to select which reactions may be important , and detailed discussions on these are contained in this section .",
    "the necessary formulae for the abundance computation by including bbncrs contributions are depicted in section [ computation scheme and results ] .",
    "the numerical results are given in this section .",
    "section [ discussion ] contains our conclusions and discussions .",
    "some calculation details are given in appendix [ classification of exothermic reactions ] and [ cross sections and details of computation scheme ] .",
    "in order to estimate the effects of bbncrs , we need to know the flux , the energy range and the energy spectrum of bbncrs .",
    "they are maybe in evolution during its work time with the universe expanding , so the following characters can be seen as an average .",
    "obviously we do nt have any knowledge on bbncrs , therefore we examine some constraints on bbncrs .",
    "candidate for bbncrs may be protons , neutrons , nuclei and electrons .",
    "neutrons are hard to accelerate for electric neutrality , and electrons are out of consideration in sbbn computation , so we focus on nuclei . because helium loses energy more quickly through coulomb scattering @xcite due to the higher nuclear electric charge @xcite , we exclude @xmath5he and @xmath27he as the components of bbncrs .",
    "we assume that bbncrs consist of energetic hydrogens , namely protons , deuterons and tritones . in order not to violate the success of sbbn",
    ", the intensity of each kind of bbncrs must be much lower than that of the corresponding sbbn particles . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the fraction of bbncrs is fixed as one single free parameter @xmath28 .",
    "next we examine the energy range of bbncrs . in order not to change deuterium abundance significantly",
    ", we must avoid bbncrs contributions from reaction d@xmath292h . note that the threshold energy and cross section of this reaction are 3.337 mev and @xmath30 barn respectively .",
    "we examined the endothermic reactions with threshold energy @xcite below 3.337 mev . in order to destroy @xmath0be by proton ,",
    "the most effective one is @xmath0be@xmath31he with threshold energy e@xmath321.814 mev .",
    "other endothermic reactions besides @xmath0be@xmath31he are summarized in table [ endothermic ] .    by energetic hydrogen with threshold energy below 3.337 mev .",
    "[ endothermic ]    .endothermic reactions [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     at last but not least , the critic issue for the bbncrs is about acceleration mechanism during bbn and whether the required flux and energy range as well as spectrum can be induced .",
    "anyhow the energetic particles are thought to be easily thermalized by photons and nuclei around before they collide with other nuclei @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank xiao - jun bi and jie meng for the stimulating discussions .",
