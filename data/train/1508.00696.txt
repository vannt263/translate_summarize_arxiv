    "time reversal ( t ) is a fundamental symmetry in particle physics and observation of t - asymmetry plays a crucial role to investigate the property of theoretical aspects .",

    "the idea of taking t - asymmetry is based on @xcite-@xcite .",
    "babar stated that the observation is the first evidence of t - violation in b - system , and babar observable naively seems to be t - asymmetry .",
    "however , discussion in ref.@xcite shows that babar observable slightly deviates from a t - odd quantity .    in this article",
    ", we construct an asymmetry which consists of @xmath4 meson system . the difference between babar asymmetry and the one in this article",
    "is stated .",

    ", one can refer the paper@xcite .",
    "in this section , an event number asymmetry is constructed and one can check how it behaves under t - transformation . using processes which come from @xmath5 decay ,",
    "the following processes in @xmath4 system are considered , @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates the cp odd state of @xmath4 meson .",
    "the processes ( a ) and ( b ) are naively related with time reversal since the time direction is opposite to each other . in fig.[fig1 ] , the entire processes of ( a ) and ( b ) are shown respectively .",

    ", cp tagging is conducted at time @xmath8 to determine @xmath9 ( cp even b meson ) , and one also identify @xmath7 due to einstein podolsky rosen ( epr ) correlation from @xmath5 decay . at time",
    "@xmath10 , b meson decays into @xmath11 and the flavor tagging method enables us to determine @xmath12 .",
    "hence , one can select the event of @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , one can obtain events of ( b ) with flavor tagging and cp tagging .",
    "time dependent asymmetry is defined as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are time dependent decay rates for the processes ( a ) and ( b ) in eq.([2.1 ] ) .",

    ", we investigate the event number asymmetry so that the contribution from @xmath22 in eq.([2.5 ] ) needs to be taken account and the contribution from @xmath3 is calculated . with the time dependent decay rate in eq.([2.3 ] ) , the asymmetry in eq.([2.2 ] ) is given as , @xmath26 the event number asymmetry in eq.([asym ] ) is expanded as , @xmath27 hereafter , we discuss the coefficient of @xmath28 and the other coefficients in eq.([2.6 ] ) are evaluated and discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the following quantities are introduced , @xmath29 where @xmath4 decay amplitude is denoted @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 , while inverse decay amplitudes are written as @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 . mixing parameters in b and k systems",
    "are denoted as , @xmath38 one can check@xcite that @xmath39 and @xmath40 in eqs.([para]-[b ] ) are odd or even under t - transformation .",
    "the transformation property is exhibited in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    ".transformation properties of the parameters under t - transformation .",
    "these parameters are to express the asymmetry so that one can show the transformation property of each term . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the coefficient @xmath41 in eq.([2.6 ] ) is parameterized as , @xmath42 in eq.([2.8 ] ) , @xmath41 is written in terms of parameters which transform odd or even under t - transformation as shown in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath43 in eq.([2.8 ] ) denotes wrong sign semi - leptonic decays of @xmath4 meson such like @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "formulation of @xmath43 is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "one can find that the quantities in eq.([2.8 ] ) include not only t - odd terms but also t - even contribution .",
    "this slight deviation from t - odd quantities is pointed out in ref.@xcite regarding to babar asymmetry@xcite .",
    "the event number asymmetry coefficients in eq.([2.8 ] ) slightly deviate from t - odd quantity as well as babar asymmetry .",
    "there exists contribution from mixing induced cp violation in kaon system since the final states in fig.[fig1 ] include @xmath46 and @xmath47 which are different from exact cp eigenstates . extracting @xmath3 in eq.([2.8 ] )",
    ", one expresses , @xmath48 under phase redefinition of a quark such like @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 transforms as @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath53 in eq.([2.14 ] ) is shown as a phase convention independent parameter .",
    "one also sees that @xmath54 is phase convention independent and the quantities in eq.([2.13 ] ) are phase convention independent .",
    "we find that @xmath55 arises to contribute to @xmath41 in eq.([2.13 ] ) and @xmath41 becomes a quantity of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , t - even parts in eq.([2.8 ] ) are found and the coefficients slightly deviate from t - odd quantities . hereafter , we discuss conditions for the coefficients in eq.([2.6 ] ) to be t - odd ( t - violating ) quantities .",
    "there are two types of such a condition .",
    "the first one is ( 1 ) b - meson state equivalence which is originally suggested and calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "this condition is regarding to b - meson states which appear in fig.[fig1 ] and it requires that b meson states should be equivalent to the states which reveal in diagrams whose time direction is totally opposite to fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "( therefore such diagram contains @xmath57 as a final state and @xmath58 as an initial state ) this is diagrammatically discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second type of the conditions is ( 2 ) @xmath59 ; t - even part of the ratio of the overall normalizations in eq.([2.5 ] ) should vanish . since the event number asymmetry in eq.([2.2 ] )",
    "is evaluated with non - zero @xmath22 , @xmath22 can give rise to t - even effect .",
    "this is not the case for babar asymmetry@xcite since it eliminates the effect of overall normalization difference between the two processes ( a ) and ( b ) in eq.(2.1 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath59 is satisfied , @xmath60 is a t - odd quantity while @xmath61 is proven@xcite to be a t - even quantity .",
    "therefore , eq.([asym ] ) reads as , @xmath62 and a(t ) turns out to be t - odd quantity .",
    "one can show that the event number asymmetry coefficients in eq.([2.6 ] ) become t - odd quantities when the two types of the conditions are simultaneously satisfied@xcite .",
    "in this article , the event number asymmetry is investigated for the two processes : @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the constructed asymmetry in eq.([2.2 ] ) appears to include not only t - odd part but also t - even part , as shown in ref.@xcite with respect to babar asymmetry@xcite .",
    "the mixing induced cp violation of kaon system , i.e. , @xmath3 contributes to the asymmetry since the final states given in @xmath65 and @xmath66 contain @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we extracted the effect of @xmath3 and showed the contribution to an observable in eq.([2.13 ] ) .",
    "formulation in this article is phase convention independent so that the coefficients in eqs.([2.13 ] ) are invariant under phase redefinition of quarks .",
    "furthermore , we discussed the conditions for the asymmetry to be a t - odd quantity .",
    "the two types of such a condition are investigated ; ( 1 ) b - meson state equivalence and ( 2 ) vanishment of t - even part of overall normalizations ratio of the decay rates which form the asymmetry ( denoted as @xmath59 ) .",
    "the condition ( 1 ) requires @xcite that the b - meson state which appears in the process in fig.[fig1 ] should be equivalent to the b - meson which reveals in a process whose time direction is totally opposite to fig.[fig1 ] . the condition ( 2 ) is regarding to the difference of overall normalization of the rates .",
    "we consider the event number asymmetry so that one should take into account the condition ( 2 ) unlike babar asymmetry @xcite .",
    "one found that the t - even part of @xmath22 yields t - even contribution to the coefficients of the asymmetry .",
    "we conclude that the coefficients of the event number asymmetry become t - odd quantities when the conditions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) are simultaneously satisfied .",
