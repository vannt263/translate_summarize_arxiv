    "the magnesium - zinc alloy system possesses the greatest precipitation hardening response of commercial mg - based alloys @xcite due to the precipitation of a fine , rod - like precipitate termed @xmath1@xcite .",
    "these precipitates provide resistance to basal slip , being highly elongated , with aspect ratios of around 40:1 , and resistant to shearing by dislocations@xcite . in fully aged samples",
    "the precipitates also significantly restrict deformation by twinning @xcite .    despite the importance of this phase in strengthening mg - zn alloys ,",
    "there has been on - going uncertainty regarding its structure .",
    "early studies concluded that the rod - like precipitates possessed a @xmath8 hexagonal laves phase structure with lattice parameters a=0.52 nm , c = 0.85nm@xcite .",
    "this view has also been supported by more recent studies @xcite .",
    "other investigators have proposed that the structure is instead that of a monoclinic phase with lattice parameters a=2.596 nm , b=0.524 nm , c=1.428 nm , @xmath9 @xcite and with a complex domain structure @xcite .",

    "the @xmath12 planes were aligned parallel to the @xmath13 planes @xcite .",
    "other possibilities were orientation relationships with @xmath12 parallel to the @xmath14 or @xmath15 planes , or @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1precipitate is metastable and further ageing of mg - zn alloys results in the precipitation of a plate - like phase , termed @xmath17 , on the basal planes of the mg matrix .",
    "it is accepted that this hexagonal phase does possess the @xmath8 hexagonal laves phase structure ( with lattice parameters a=0.52 nm , c = 0.85 nm @xcite ) and orientation relationship @xmath2_{\\mathrm{mg}}\\parallel [ 0001]_{\\ce{mgzn2 } } $ ] ; @xmath18 @xcite . a lath - like form with @xmath2_\\mathrm{mg}\\parallel [ 11\\overline{2}0]_{\\ce{mgzn2 } } $ ] ; @xmath19 @xcite has also been reported as a minor variant .",
    "similar rod - shaped ( @xmath1 ) and plate - shaped ( @xmath20 ) precipitates are also observed in mg - zn - re / y ( re = rare earth ) alloys .",
    "these precipitates are thought to be identical in structure and composition to those in mg - zn alloys since rare earth elements and yttrium segregate to ternary phase precipitates at the grain boundaries @xcite and have not been detected within the @xmath1and @xmath20precipitates @xcite .    among the ternary phases also exists the quasi - crystalline icosahedral phase ( i - phase , @xmath21)@xcite .",
    "this phase exists in equilibrium with @xmath22-mg phase , forming a two phase field when the atomic ratio of zn : y is near 6 , as in the alloy studied here .",
    "the monoclinic and laves phase phases include zinc lattice sites which possess icosahedral symmetry and are thus are structurally related .",

    "there appear to be structural similarities between the binary phases and the icosahedral phase and the monoclinic phase provides a model for the icosahedral structure@xcite .",
    "a proper understanding of the relationships between the monoclinic and hexagonal phases would assist in clarifying their structural relationship to the i - phase and resolve the uncertainty regarding the phase present in the rod - shaped @xmath1precipitates .    in the present work ,",

    "a magnesium alloy containing 2.8at.%zn and 0.4at.%y was produced via direct chill casting .",
    "the billet was homogenised at 350@xmath23 , for 15h and extruded with extrusion ratio 12:1 at 300@xmath23to produce a 12 mm diameter rod .",
    "the extrusion process produced a tube texture , in which the basal planes lie parallel to the extrusion direction .",
    "for this texture , compression in the extrusion direction corresponds to @xmath24-axis tension of mg and results in extensive @xmath0 twinning at stresses just above the yield point @xcite .",
    "cylindrical compression samples were machined from the extruded rod , encapsulated in helium , solution treated ( 400@xmath23 , 1h ) and quenched in water .",
    "an instron mechanical tester was used to apply a total of 2.2% plastic strain at a strain rate of @xmath25 .",
    "the level of the plastic strain was chosen so as to be sufficient to generate deformation twins while limiting slip and dislocation multiplication .",
    "the alloys were aged at 150@xmath23 in an oil bath for periods from 8h to 48h .",
    "foils for tem examination were prepared from the aged specimens , ground to @xmath26 and then thinned to perforation using a gatan precision ion polishing system .",
    "a jeol 4000ex instrument operating at 400kv was used for high - resolution transmission electron microscopic analysis .",
    "multi - slice image simulations were carried out using jems software using the pre - loaded parameters for the the jeol 4000ex microscope @xcite .",
    "the microstructure of the alloys consisted of rod - like @xmath1precipitates within both the magnesium matrix and the deformation twins , with larger , irregular precipitates present at the twin boundaries .",

    "the present work is concerned exclusively with twin - boundary precipitates , whose larger size permitted a close examination of their structure .",
    "hexagonal laves phase precipitates were frequently observed on the twin boundaries , an example is shown in figure  [ laves - tbp ] . the matrix ( lower portion )",
    "is viewed along the hexagonal axis ( shown by fft inset lower left ) while the twin is 4@xmath29 from its @xmath30 $ ] zone .",

    "the interface with the matrix is faceted on the @xmath33 planes ; facets on @xmath34 planes were also observed .",
    "the precipitate - twin interfaces which appear planar here were curved in most instances . the orientation relationship between the precipitate and the twin is @xmath35_\\mathrm{mg } \\parallel [ 0001]_\\ce{mgzn2}$ ] ; @xmath36 .",
    "this retains the matching between @xmath37 and @xmath38 planes which exists between this precipitate and the matrix .",
    "planar defects were observed in these precipitates , which were manifested in the fft pattern like the one shown on the upper left in figure  [ laves - tbp ] . in this micrograph ,",
    "the most visible defects are the diagonal lines across . due to these defects ,",
    "streaking occurred across the spots in the pattern .",
    "these were of two kinds . when the diagonal defects were excluded from fft , streaking occurred only along @xmath39 direction .",
    "this indicates stacking defects along the hexagonal axis .",
    "when the diagonal lines were included in the fft , strong streaking occurred only along the @xmath40 $ ] reciprocal direction , perpendicular to the direction of these lines in the micrograph .",
    "the significance of these two kind of planar defects will be discussed in a later section .    precipitates composed solely of the monoclinic phase were not observed on the twin boundaries .",
    "however , high resolution tem images of the precipitates frequently showed regions of both and phases within the same precipitate .",
    "the precipitates in which the and hexagonal laves phases co - existed consisted of a central region of the monoclinic phase , with one or two variants of the hexagonal laves phase in contact with it and with the magnesium matrix or twin .",
    "an example of such a dual - phase precipitate is presented in the hrtem micrograph of figure  [ hrtem-1 ] .",
    "the matrix is viewed along the hexagonal axis , as evidenced by fft in figure  [ fft-1 ] , while the twin region is close to the @xmath41 $ ] zone .",
    "the image was from a relatively thicker portion of the foil and was obtained close to the scherzer defocus , which is about -45 nm . the position of the twin boundary is indicated by the dashed lines and can also be seen in the enlarged insets showing where the precipitate is in contact with the twin boundary .",
    "the central region of the precipitate is in contact with the matrix and belongs to the phase with the monoclinic structure clearly evident , and confirmed by indexing of the fft shown in figure  [ fft-2 ] .",
    "this central region of the precipitate has the orientation relationship @xmath2_{\\mathrm{mg } } \\parallel [ 010]_{\\ce{mg4zn7 } } $ ] ; @xmath42 with respect to the matrix . in all",
    "such precipitates , the monoclinic phase was found to form with the @xmath4_\\ce{mg4zn7}$ ] axis aligned with the [ 0001 ] direction of either the matrix or the twin , with no apparent preference for either region .    in the left @xmath43 and lower @xmath44 regions of this precipitate ,",
    "the structure looks changed from the monoclinic in between .",
    "ffts were obtained from these , shown in figures  [ fft-3 ] and [ fft-4 ] .",
    "both of these could be indexed to the phase in zone axis @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "thus regions a and b in figure  [ hrtem-1 ] are two differently oriented variants of the phase , which are in contact with both the matrix and the twin .",
    "the fft for the monoclinic phase ( figure  [ fft-2 ] ) contains a number of streaks lying parallel to the ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) planes .",
    "similar features have been reported for rod - like @xmath1precipitates of the monoclinic phase and the presence of a significant population of stacking faults or other planar defects was inferred @xcite .",
    "based on these orientations , stereograms were plotted to see the ors between the phases .",
    "the stereogram in figure  [ fig - stereo1 ] shows the ors between the matrix , the twin and the phase . as mentioned before , the ( 201 ) plane of the phase is along the @xmath45 plane of the matrix ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "the transition structure described above are clearly only examples and it would be possible to construct a range of such structures from the rhombic and hexagonal units described in section  [ mono - laves - str ] .",
    "the transition structures are larger in unit cell size than and the hexagonal units comprise a smaller proportion of the structure , which will have a mg : zn ratio between the laves and monoclinic structures i.e. compositions will be in the range @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that there may be gradual variations in composition across the - interfaces , however this system appears able to accommodate precipitates with compositions between these two values , so long as such structures as constructed principally of the acute rhombic unit present in both and phases .",
    "it is quite clear that @xmath1is a transition precipitate .",
    "the precipitation sequence within the matrix is well known to commence with the precipitation of @xmath1 rods in the under - aged condition , followed by the @xmath20plates upon overageing @xcite .",
    "the plate - shaped precipitates in the over - aged condition have long been associated with the structure , while the rods present at earlier stages of ageing have been identified as either @xcite or @xcite . while both phases examined here are metastable intermediates ( the equilibrium phase having a composition mgzn and a rhombohedral structure",
    "@xcite ) it is logical to conclude that the phase is thermodynamically more stable than , since that latter is only observed in the under - aged or peak - aged condition .    in the present work ,",
    "the precipitates were examined in a condition close to peak age and the predominant precipitate in the matrix ( and twins ) were @xmath1rods , which appeared to have a structure .",
    "the twin boundary precipitate were considerably larger in volume and consisted of either hexagonal or dual - phase - .",
    "as such the twin - boundary precipitates appear to have progressed further towards equilibrium that those in the matrix , both in terms of the presence of the phase and in the greater size which has been achieved .",
    "the dual - phase precipitates were comprised of a central region of the monoclinic phase , which was always found to adopt one of the previously reported orientation relationships to either the matrix or the twin . in contrast , the hexagonal phase sometimes formed with an orientation relationship to the matrix ( e.g. region b in figure  [ hrtem-2 ] ) and sometimes showed no clear lattice matching to the matrix or twin ( e.g. region a in figure  [ hrtem-2 ] ) . despite this difference , both variants possessed an orientation relationship to the monoclinic phase via the rhombic units .",
    "this , together with the presence of the monoclinic structure at the centre of each mixed - phase precipitate implies that this phase formed prior to the hexagonal laves phase , with the latter phase growing on the monoclinic phase .",
    "it is unclear why the nucleation of occurs first .",
    "though it is not the most stable phase by the phase diagram , the stability of small sized precipitates will be predominantly affected by the interfacial energies .",
    "the morphologies will be dictated by the relative interface energies of the precipitate - matrix interfaces . assuming @xmath1precipitates to be , its rod - like morphology is dictated by need to minimise the area of the high energy @xmath64 interface .",
    "this optimises matching between the basal planes of the magnesium matrix and the @xmath65 planes . in the plate - like @xmath20precipitates",
    ", @xmath66 interface appears to be a preferred , low energy interface and its area is maximised in this morphology .",
    "the dual - phase precipitates are formed directly in contact with the twin boundary and it is clearly necessary to recognise that the twin boundary presents a different environment from the matrix .",
    "for example , pipe diffusion along the twin boundary would provide solute at accelerated rates compared to the bulk @xcite , assisting in the formation of larger precipitates along the twin interface .",
    "in addition , both rod shaped and twin boundary precipitates are of nanometer scale , with high surface energy to volume ratios , and the interfacial energies may play a significant role in controlling precipitation . as the precipitates",
    "grow and their interface to volume ratio decreases , the phase equilibria may change .",
    "a modification of the structure may occur to lower interface energies .",
    "the change in orientation of the mg phase across the twin boundary is therefore particularly important since the precipitate is not able to adopt the preferred orientation ( and hence form the preferred interfaces ) to both matrix and twin .",
    "one addition factor that may favour the formation of in the twin boundary precipitates is the existence of at the twin interface .",
    "given the structural similarities in the form of these rhombic subunits between the and phases , and the alignment of such units , ( as described in section  [ mono - laves - str ] ) it is proposed that this feature allows the phase to provide a favourable surface on which the laves phase can precipitate .",
    "this kind of structurally - similar interface may have permitted the hexagonal phase to form , even when ( as with region a in figure  [ hrtem-2 ] ) it does not possess a good lattice match with the matrix or twin .",
    "this factor would permit the ready nucleation of the phase at the twin boundaries where pre - existing precipitates provide suitable nucleation sites .",
    "the co - existence of the monoclinic and hexagonal phases in the twin - boundary precipitates may provide an explanation for the identification of the rod - shaped @xmath1precipitates as either @xcite or @xcite . it has been shown here that the two phases can co - exist in these larger , twin - boundary precipitates , while maintaining a clear correspondence between the rhombic units within the two structures .",
    "in addition , the presence of several structurally - similar transitional phases at the - interfaces indicates that considerable structural and compositional variability can be accommodated within the precipitates . a related investigation focused specifically on the rod - like precipitates also identified both and within the rod - like precipitates @xcite .",
    "it appears probable therefore , that the rod - like @xmath1precipitates could be composed of either or both monoclinic and hexagonal phases plus a wide range of transitional structures , giving rise to the micro - domain structure reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the , and transition structures are essentially modular assemblies or similarly co - ordinated atoms . as such ,",
    "it is worthwhile to consider their relationship , not only to one another but also to the quasi - crystalline i - phase found in mg - zn - y alloys .",
    "although the phase has been considered as related to the icosahedral phase directly @xcite , it can be better described as a decagonal quasi - crystal approximant .",
    "coexistence of decagonal phase and phase and the orientation relationship between them has been reported as @xmath67 d2a(g)\\parallel[-401]$ ] ; and @xmath68 $ ] @xcite .",
    "approximant phases to decagonal quasi - crystals can be orthorhombic or monoclinic .",
    "their structure can generally be described as layered . in case of monoclinic approximants ,",
    "the unique axis corresponding to the decagonal axis , and the monoclinic angle is often close to 72@xmath69(i.e .",
    "@xmath70 ) .",
    "the length of the unique axis is nearly equal to ( or a multiple of ) the periodicity of the decagonal phase in that alloy system .",
    "a well known decagonal approximant in aluminium alloys is @xmath71 , or @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "a decagonal phase was reported in zn - mg - re alloys@xcite .",
    "the periodicity of this decagonal phase ( along the periodic decagonal axis ) is reported to be 0.255 nm .",
    "this is comparable to the lattice spacing along ( 020 ) of and ( 0002 ) of magnesium .",
    "two crystalline phases related to the decagonal phase were identified to be and , the latter of which coexisted with the decagonal phase @xcite .",
    "compositionally , only a 2at% addition of dy to the phase formed the composition of the @xmath73 decagonal phase@xcite .    in hexagonal phases related to quasi - crystalline phases , the hexagonal axis corresponds to icosahedral twofold axis @xcite .",
    "there are icosahedral clusters in three orientations , making the hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the phase , however , is a simpler phase in which the hexagonal axis corresponds to a threefold axis of the icosahedral coordination .",
    "all icosahedra are thus similarly oriented . when viewed along a @xmath74 axis , pentagonally coordinated layers are observed , as in figure  [ fig - rhomb - laves ] .",
    "these pentagons are arranged in a row and have opposite orientations in the layers at two different levels ( making two parts of icosahedra in the same orientation ) .",
    "often , domains of two phases in a grain are known to create diffraction patterns resembling those from a decagonal phase , such as in al - mn@xcite and al - mn - ni @xcite . in the present study , which is on mg - zn - y alloys , the coexistence of the two phases related to decagonal quasi - crystal and their intimately mixing in each other is analogous .    in the present phases , and ,",
    "the rhombic tiles of the intermediate layers form the structural units .",
    "the vertices of these rhombuses form the vertices of the icosahedral units . in the structure ,",
    "the main rhombic units , forming a unit of four , have an angle 72.5@xmath69 , as shown at @xmath75 in figure  [ fig - rhomb - mono ] .",
    "these units are connected by rhombuses with an angle 71.5@xmath69 .",
    "there is one more type of rhombus with an angle 67.5@xmath69 , and a triangular and a near rectangular unit . in between the unit cells , a thin rhombus ( @xmath76 in figure  [ fig - rhomb - mono ] ) can be defined , with an angle of about 37@xmath69 .",
    "the structure is composed of only one type of rhombus with an angle @xmath6172@xmath69 , whose direction alternates ( @xmath77 in figure  [ fig - rhomb - laves ] ) .",
    "the two domains of phase form on either side of the phase main rhombuses and therefore make an angle of about 72.5@xmath69with each other .",
    "precipitation on twin boundaries has been studied in a quasi - crystalline - bearing mg - zn - y alloy .",
    "twins were introduced in the alloy by extrusion followed by a 2% deformation of the extruded rod in compression .",
    "the samples were solutionised before the compressive deformation .",
    "on isothermal ageing of the deformed samples at 150@xmath29c , several forms of precipitation occurred .",
