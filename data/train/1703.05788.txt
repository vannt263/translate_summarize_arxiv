    "optimal alignments are among the main two components used by most dna - alignment algorithms which try to find similar substrings in dna - sequences . because of its great practical importance , these problems have received a tremendous amount of attention .",
    "let us explain the key points from the dna perspective .",
    "dna sequencing is one of the most important areas of study in biology .",
    "this is still rather expensive and very complex .",
    "suppose now that in a certain animal population , a certain gene is detected .",
    "this gene is probably likely to appear in the dna of other animals too , but in a slightly different form .",
    "thus , instead of repeating the same costly experiments on other animals to find the gene , they just search for a dna - segment which looks similar to the gene in the first population .",
    "this is why often dna - strings in different animals are compared in order to find places that are related . for more details on the analysis of dna",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and in particular the iid assumption which appears also in this paper is explained on page 14 of the @xcite .",
    "here is a more concrete example .",
    "assume @xmath4 is a hypothetical dna of an ancestor with two descendants , one with the dna string @xmath5 ( which lost the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 ) and another with the dna equal to @xmath8 ( which had an @xmath9 mutated into a @xmath6 ) .",
    "we align these strings ( with gaps ) , as follows : @xmath10    in the analysis of the dna one has access to the dna of the descendants only . in terms of the alignments ,",
    "one is interested in the _",
    "historic alignment_. in our example , we would have that the alignment @xmath11 is given by : @xmath12 and we call this the historic alignment .",
    "the letters which disappeared in one descendant are now represented by gaps .",
    "which alignment with gaps corresponds to the evolution history of the strings is not known apriori . in other words , in our example , we know the strings @xmath13 and @xmath8 , but not `` the true historic '' alignment given here by .    to guess which alignment is historic ,",
    "the natural attempt is to find an alignment which maximizes similarity . for this , one starts with a scoring function @xmath14 which measures similarity between letters .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the alphabet augmented by one symbol for the gap ) .",
    "the _ total score _ of an alignment is then the sum of the scores of the aligned symbol pairs . in alignment , the alignment score @xmath16 is equal to @xmath17 where @xmath7 stands for a gap .",
    "an alignment @xmath18 , which for given strings @xmath19 and @xmath20 maximizes the alignment score @xmath21 is called _ an optimal alignment_. the score of an optimal alignment is called _ optimal alignment score _ and we will denote it by @xmath22 where the maximum above is taken over all alignments with gaps of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    which alignment is optimal depends ultimately on the scoring function used . often , the scoring function biologists work with is a log likelihood . for this",
    ", one assumes models of letters evolving independently of their neighboring letters .",
    "one takes as scoring function @xmath23 , the logarithm of the probability that an ancestor letter evolves into an @xmath9 in one descendant and into a @xmath24 in the other descendant . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath24 are any two letters from the alphabet under consideration , or also the gap symbol . with this choice of scoring function ,",
    "the optimal alignment becomes the maximum - likelihood estimate for the historic alignment .",
    "a high optimal alignment score indicates relatedness of the two dna - strings .",
    "thus in testing for relatedness of dna - strings one usually takes as test statistics the optimal alignment score .",
    "the significance of such a test depends then on the order of magnitude of the fluctuation of the optimal alignment score .",
    "it has been a long open question whether for two independent i.i.d .",
    "strings of length @xmath2 , the fluctuation of the optimal alignment score is of order @xmath25 or @xmath26{n}$ ] .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we think we can see why these two different conjectures co - exist at the same time .",
    "we show that for two independent i.i.d strings of length @xmath2 the optimal alignment score ( depending on the parameters ) can contain a normal component with fluctuation of order @xmath25 .",
    "this component is not relevant for finding the optimal alignment score , because it does not depend on the alignment .",
    "_ when testing for relatedness of dna - strings one should remove this normal component , since it is only noise .",
    "this can be done by modifying the scoring function .",
    "once we `` cut out this normal component '' , the question that remain is what is the asymptotic distribution of the remainder ?",
    "is it tracy - widom ?",
    "we ca nt prove it in full generality , however we check this for the special case where the number of gaps is a small power of the length of the strings and the gaps are allowed only into one string .",
    "_    _ we also exhibit a scoring function with an alignment score which is of the order @xmath25 but not normal , nor tracy - widom .",
    "this , should then show that any claim that the order @xmath27=o(n)$ ] automatically implies asymptotic normality is wrong !",
    "( here @xmath28 designates the optimal alignment score of two i.i.d .",
    "random strings of length @xmath2 . ) to prove normality , one needs a more detailed knowledge of the path structure of the optimal alignments ! _    the optimal alignment can be viewed as a special case of last passage percolation with correlations . to our knowledge , many of the proofs for models of first and last passage percolation , where the asymptotic distribution is known , go back to proving asymptotic equivalence with the following functional of brownian motions : consider @xmath29 a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "standard brownian motions . also consider when @xmath30 goes to infinity , the functional @xmath31+[b^2(t_2)-b^2(t_1)]+\\ldots+[b^k(t_k)-b^k(t_{k-1}))]\\ ] ] which properly rescaled becomes tracy - widom @xcite .",
    "now , in our case , we have a similar situation , where instead we have a sequence of _ dependent _ identically distributed standard brownian motions @xmath32 .",
    "however , the correlation structure is rather simple .",
    "precisely , there exists a brownian motion @xmath33 and i.i.d brownian motions @xmath29 so that @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "hence , instead of independent brownian motions we have correlated ones and the maximum given in can be written as @xmath36+[w^2(t_2)-w^2(t_1)]+\\ldots+[w^k(t_k)-w^k(t_{k-1}))]=\\\\&= v(1)-v(0)+\\max_{0\\leq t_1<t_2<\\ldots < t_k\\leq 1 } [ b^1(t_1)-b^1(0)]+[b^2(t_2)-b^2(t_1)]+\\ldots+[b^k(t_k)-b^k(t_{k-1}))].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we get a normal component plus a term on a smaller scale which is indeed tracy - widom .",
    "this is the reason why we can prove in the current paper , under a very special situation ( adding gaps only into one string and keeping their number a small power of @xmath2 ) , that in the limit we obtain a normal plus tracy - widom on a smaller scale .",
    "however , the normal part is often irrelevant for the optimal alignment problem .",
    "note here that the normal component @xmath37 does not dependent on the choice of @xmath38 ( which in what follows , correspond to alignments ) .",
    "again , the normal component is in some sense irrelevant for finding the optimal alignment .",
    "we should leave it out because it is only added noise .",
    "we consider two random i.i.d .",
    "strings @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the sequel",
    ", @xmath28 denotes the optimal alignment score of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "we have been able to prove the order @xmath44=o(n)\\ ] ] in many situations @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this proves the conjecture of waterman @xcite ( for certain specific distributions of the letters and scoring functions ) , but is different from what chavatal - sankoff have conjectured .",
    "the order conjectured by chavatal - sankoff is the order which one would expect knowing that @xmath45 is also the weight of the heaviest path from @xmath46 to @xmath47 in an lpp - formulation of our problem .",
    "( in the physics literature , @xcite , the order for the standard deviation of the heaviest path from @xmath46 to @xmath47 in a vast class of lpp - models is conjectured to be @xmath48 not @xmath49 . for more details see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us explain what lpp is and how our optimal alignment can be formulated as an lpp - problem with correlated weights . in lpp , one considers an oriented graph @xmath50 with a random weight function @xmath51 of the edges .",
    "let @xmath52 .",
    "a path from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in the graph @xmath50 is then defined as a sequence of vertices : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "the total weight of the path @xmath53 is given by : @xmath57 an optimal path from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is then a path which maximizes the total weight among all paths from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "+ now , our optimal alignment problem can be formulated as an lpp on the integer lattice with the optimal alignment score @xmath28 being the weight of the path of maximal weight from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . for this",
    "we take the set of vertices @xmath58 to be @xmath59 and the edges to go always one to the right , one up or diagonally up to the next vertex .",
    "the weight for horizontal and vertical edges is minus the gap penalty . for the edge @xmath60",
    "the weight is @xmath61 . with this setting",
    "when we align a letter with a gap , this corresponds to moving one unit vertically or horizontally .",
    "aligning @xmath62 with @xmath63 corresponds to moving along the edge @xmath64 .",
    "the optimal path then defines an optimal alignment where for every edge @xmath60 contained in the optimal path , aligns @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the transversal fluctuation measures how far the optimal path from @xmath46 to @xmath47 deviates from the diagonal .",
    "+    let us give an example .",
    "take the two strings @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "consider the following alignment with gaps : @xmath67 we can represent this alignment as a path on the integer points in two dimension .",
    "we are always allowed to go to the left by one unit or up by one unit or diagonal to the next integer point .",
    "when we go horizontal or vertical , this means that we align a letter with a gap .",
    "when we go diagonal this means that we align two letters with each other .",
    "below , we show how we represent the alignment given in by a path on the two dimensional integer lattice : @xmath68 to visualize , the path represented by the last table above , draw short segments between the points : @xmath69 to @xmath70 , then @xmath70 to @xmath71 , .... and up to a segment from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the path is then given by this sequence of segments .",
    "so , the first such segment from @xmath69 to @xmath70 is diagonal , and corresponds to aligning the two @xmath74 s with each other .",
    "the score - contribution for this is @xmath75 .",
    "then , the segment from @xmath70 to @xmath71 is diagonal and corresponds to aligning the @xmath76 s .",
    "its score contribution is @xmath77 .",
    "the segment from @xmath71 to @xmath78 is vertical and hence corresponds to aligning a letter with a gap . in the current case ,",
    "it is the first @xmath79 in @xmath80 which gets aligned with a gap , and the score for this is the gap penalty @xmath81 . then @xmath82 is again diagonal and corresponds to aligning @xmath2 with @xmath2 , with score @xmath83 .",
    "then , the segment @xmath84 is horizontal and corresponds to aligning @xmath85 in @xmath86 with a gap , which contributes to minus a gap penalty to the total score .",
    "the final segment @xmath87 is diagonal , and corresponds to aligning the last @xmath79 of @xmath86 with the last @xmath79 of @xmath80 .",
    "score is then @xmath88 . in other words ,",
    "the horizontal or vertical moves contribute minus a gap penalty each , whilst the diagonal moves contribute to the score by aligning the corresponding letters . in this example",
    ", we aligned only identical letters .",
    "this is not always the case . in dna - analysis ,",
    "when letters can mutate we also align similar letters with each other , not just identical .",
    "formally we can view an alignment with gaps of the strings @xmath89 and @xmath90 as a couple consisting of two increasing integer sequences .",
    "the sequence @xmath18 @xmath91 and the sequence @xmath92 @xmath93 are non - negative integers . here",
    "@xmath94 is any integer non - negative number .",
    "the alignment with gaps defined by @xmath95 is then the alignment which aligns @xmath96 with @xmath97 for all @xmath98 and aligns all remaining letters with a gap .",
    "the alignment score is then @xmath99 where is @xmath100 represents the total gap penalty .",
    "( the penalty for one given gap being @xmath101 ) . in our current example , we have the number of aligned letter pairs is @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , we find : @xmath103 , whilst @xmath104 .",
    "the path representing the alignment given by @xmath105 is the path containing all the segments : @xmath106 for @xmath98 and additionally a minimum amount of vertical and horizontal unit length integer segments so as to make this a connected path .",
    "+ first passage percolation ( fpp ) and lpp are part of a vast area of statistical physics @xcite which is concerned with random growth models for which physicists expect some universality properties .",
    "more specifically , one considers growth of a cluster where material is being attached randomly on the surface of a nucleus .",
    "there are many fundamental questions open for decades , such as the universality of the fluctuation exponents .",
    "many theoretical physicists , crystallographers and probabilists have worked on this and many conjectures have been formulated @xcite , as for example that the fluctuation should behave like @xmath48 and the transversal fluctuation should be or order @xmath107 ( see kpz - conjecture in @xcite ) .",
    "these are difficult conjectures and rigorous results were obtained only under some special circumstances of lpp models , like longest increasing subsequence @xcite , lpp on @xmath108 with exponential or geometric waiting times @xcite and the case of percolation in a narrow tube @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the best results show only a fluctuations of less than @xmath109 @xcite and above @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we have been able to prove our results for several longest common subsequence ( lcs ) and optimal alignments ( oa ) models .",
    "+ lcs are a special case of oa . for two strings @xmath89 and",

    "the length of the lcs of @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be viewed as an optimal alignment score of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for this",

    "the length of the lcs is also equal to the optimal alignment score .",
    "+ our results together with the results of baik , deift and johansson @xcite , are among the few rigorous results determining the exact order of the fluctuation exponents for some non - trivial fpp or lpp related 2-d models . in their work , as in ours , the fluctuation is of order @xmath48 and the rescaled asymptotic limiting law is tracy - widom .",
    "another interesting paper is for the tasep model , by borodin , ferrari , praehofer and sasamoto @xcite .",
    "there they do not use the same approach of reducing the problem to formula and , and it is not the gue which appears in the limit , but goe .",
    "other methods used to establish the solvability of lpp models are the vertex operator and fock space formalism put foward by okounkov @xcite in the study of schur process .    our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s:2 ]",
    ", we introduce the main decomposition of the scoring function and show examples where the limiting distribution of the optimal alignment score is normal alongside with other examples which are non - normal . in the next section , namely section  [ s:3 ] ,",
    "we restrict the number of gaps to a certain number @xmath30 which is finite and fixed and allow the gaps only in one sequence . here",
    "we give a general description of the optimal alignment in terms of multiple dependent random walks and outline an argument which supports the conjecture that under some conditions , if @xmath30 is replaced by @xmath115 with small @xmath116 , then the ( rescaled ) limiting distribution of the optimal alignment is tracy - widom .",
    "we can not prove this statement rigorously in general , but in the next section , namely section  [ s:4 ] , we prove this for the key scoring function @xmath117 under the assumption that the number of gaps is @xmath118 for small @xmath116 and the second sequence of letters is distributed normally rather than @xmath119 .",
    "the main rigorous result is stated in theorem  [ t:1 ] and appears in section  [ s:4 ] .",
    "section  [ s:5 ] is dedicated to technical results while the last one , section  [ s:6 ] contains a few simulations .",
    "in this section we discuss the general decomposition of the scoring function in a natural basis .",
    "the point of this is that some of the scoring functions are in some sense artificial because the optimal score does not depend on the alignment",
    ". this will give a normal behavior in the limit for the optimal score .",
    "we consider symmetric scoring for a binary alphabet .",
    "we do not allow alignments of gaps with gaps , so the scoring functions we consider are given by a @xmath120 matrix , with one irrelevant entry , namely @xmath121 here @xmath7 stands for a gap . in our case",
    "we will put @xmath122 and we will always assume that the above matrix is symmetric hence @xmath123 and @xmath124 , whilst @xmath125 .",
    "the linear space of such @xmath120 symmetric matrices is generated by the following five elements    @xmath126    and @xmath127 note that the matrices @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are orthogonal to each other ( with respect to the canonical inner product given by @xmath131 ) . also , the matrices @xmath132 and @xmath133 concern only with the gap penalty .",
    "thus , any scoring function we will consider can be written as @xmath134    first , it is important to note that the part @xmath135 gives the same alignment score for any alignment .",
    "this is so , because @xmath128 and @xmath129 can both be viewed as linear additive functions in the following way . for",
    "a given a function @xmath136 , take the  linear ",
    "scoring function @xmath6 defined by : @xmath137 for all @xmath138 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath139",
    ". clearly for such a `` linear '' scoring function , with value @xmath139 , the alignment score for any alignment @xmath11 does not depend @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , it is trivial to check that @xmath140 furthermore , the expression on the right side of the above equality is a linear function of a binomial random variable .",
    "now , in our case , @xmath129 is of the above type with the function @xmath74 given by @xmath141 thus , we find that @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the total number of @xmath144 s in both strings @xmath0 and @xmath1 combined whilst @xmath145 denotes the number of @xmath146 s in both strings combined .",
    "noting that @xmath147 , we finally find that @xmath148 here @xmath143 is a binomial with parameter @xmath149 and @xmath150 , consequently , @xmath151=var[n_n^a]=2np_{a}(1-p_{a}).\\ ] ]    similarly , the alignment score according to @xmath128 does not depend on the alignment and is also equal to @xmath2 .",
    "since the alignment scores according to @xmath128 and @xmath129 do not depend on the alignment we find for any scoring function @xmath152 that the optimal alignment score can be decomposed as follows : @xmath153    according to the central limit theorem , @xmath143 is asymptotically normal on the scale @xmath25 and thus we can conclude that @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "now , since the part @xmath156 does not depend on the alignment it has no affect on which alignment is optimal . also , it is just noise added for testing if sequences are related or not .",
    "this noise can be removed , since it is known .",
    "equivalently , we can just take @xmath157 as scoring function instead of @xmath152 .      in this section",
    "we present a simple example for which the optimal alignment score , properly rescaled , converges to a distribution which is not normal .",
    "interestingly , the scaling is still the same as in the case of the previous section , namely , @xmath25 .",
    "as mentioned , for scoring functions of the type @xmath158 , the alignment score does not depend on the alignment @xmath11 of the strings @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , the limiting distribution of the optimal alignment score is normal on the scale @xmath25 since    @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the total number of @xmath144 s in the concatenated string @xmath163 .",
    "since @xmath162 is binomial with parameter @xmath149 and @xmath164 , the above optimal score , properly rescaled converges to the normal .",
    "thus we can interpret the scoring function with @xmath165 as degenerate and hence not relevant for practical purposes .",
    "next we consider the following scoring function @xmath166 if @xmath167 designate the number of @xmath144 s in @xmath39 and @xmath168 designate the number of @xmath144 s in @xmath40 , then , the optimal alignment score according to the scoring function @xmath169 is simply equal to the minimum of @xmath167 and @xmath170 , namely , @xmath171 this is so because aligning a @xmath146 with a @xmath146 gives a negative score , whilst aligning something with a gap gives @xmath69 .",
    "so , the optimal alignment is going to align all @xmath146 s with gaps . since an @xmath144 aligned with an @xmath144 scores positively",
    ", the optimal alignment is going to align a maximum number of @xmath144 s with each other .",
    "+ note that @xmath167 and @xmath168 have the same expectation and both tend asymptotically to be normal when re - scaled by @xmath172 .",
    "hence , we get @xmath173}{\\sqrt{np(1-p)}}= \\min\\left\\{\\frac{n_a^x - e[n_a^x]}{\\sqrt{np(1-p ) } } , \\frac{n_a^y - e[n_a^y]}{\\sqrt{np(1-p)}}\\right\\ } \\approx\\min\\{\\mathcal{n}_1,\\mathcal{n}_2 \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are two standard normal independent of each other , which is certainly not normal .",
    "thus , we have a non - normal limiting distribution , but still we have a fluctuation on a scale @xmath25 !    notice also the following interesting fact , namely that there are many different alignments , which are very far away from each other . indeed , say that @xmath176 .",
    "then , the optimal alignments can be characterized as follows .",
    "choose a subset of @xmath144 s in @xmath0 with cardinality equal to @xmath177 .",
    "these @xmath144 s are aligned with gaps . then align all the remaining @xmath144 s in @xmath0 with @xmath144 s from @xmath1 .",
    "finally , align all the @xmath146 s with gaps .",
    "now , real life scoring functions should not have @xmath178 too small , since in practical situations , like genetic evolution , there are usually not too many gaps .",
    "this reflects the fact that there are not too many deletes from an ancestors dna . in the next section",
    "we show that if we look for the optimal alignment under the constrain of the total number of gaps being small , then we get that @xmath179 can be decomposed into a normal part on the scale @xmath25 plus a smaller part whose limiting distribution is non - normal .",
    "in this section , under the assumptions that the number of gaps is finite and fixed , we present a general outline of an argument which should be sufficiently convincing that the limiting behavior of the optimal alignment is normal in the scale @xmath25 plus a tracy - widom on a smaller scale .",
    "let us assume that we only consider alignments with a fixed number of gaps equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is a fixed constant . to simplify the problem we will allow the gaps only in one sequence .    let @xmath30 be a constant and let @xmath180 and @xmath181 be the two random strings of letters .",
    "thus , we will align exactly @xmath30 letters from @xmath1 with gaps , but all the letters of @xmath0 will be aligned with letters of @xmath1 .",
    "we will consider the optimal alignment of @xmath0 and @xmath1 under the constrain that there are exactly @xmath30 gaps all inserted in @xmath182 .",
    "the corresponding optimal score will be denoted by @xmath183 . to specify an alignment we simply need to specify which @xmath30 letters of @xmath1 get aligned with gaps ,",
    "thus we need to specify a sequence of @xmath30 increasing integers @xmath184 .",
    "the vectors consisting of these integers then define our alignment , namely , align @xmath185 with a gap for all @xmath186 .",
    "let @xmath187 denote the random walk defined recurrently on @xmath188 by @xmath189 and then : @xmath190 for all @xmath191 and for @xmath192 $ ] .",
    "( to simplify the notation we assume that the sequence of the @xmath62 s is a double infinite sequence of i.i.d .",
    "variables @xmath193 in the problem which we will consider only a finite number of @xmath62 s will have @xmath194 and their contribution will be negligible ) .    for example , the first random walk @xmath195 is then defined by @xmath196 similary , the second random walk @xmath197 is defined as follows : @xmath198 + consider the alignment score under the constrain that the @xmath199-th gap is aligned with @xmath200 , for all @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is a given increasing sequence of integers . the alignment with exactly @xmath30 gaps",
    "is uniquely defined by this constrain and its alignment score is : @xmath203 recall that we assume a zero gap penalty .",
    "let us give an example .",
    "take the string @xmath204 and @xmath205 we could align @xmath206 and @xmath207 with a gap",
    ". then we have @xmath208 gaps and @xmath209 whilst @xmath210 .",

    "the covariance is always about @xmath262 .",

    "this will depend on the value of @xmath224 .",
    "now , we want to let @xmath30 go to infinity at a slower rate then @xmath2 .",
    "most papers on closeness of random walk and brownian motion are for fixed dimension .",
    "also , in our case , any @xmath30 consecutive components of the multi - dimensional random walk @xmath289 are correlated .",
    "however , still assuming that the approximations hold for fixed dimension and correlated multidimensional random walk , we could take @xmath224 to be @xmath290 whilst @xmath291 for @xmath292 a constant not depending on @xmath2 or @xmath30 . in this case for the inequality to be useful , we would need @xmath293 to be of smaller order than @xmath288 .",
    "this is the case when @xmath294 , with @xmath116 small enough .",
    "in this section , we are going to treat the case where the number of gaps @xmath30 increases to infinity with @xmath2 and the simplest such scenario is the case of @xmath295 for some small @xmath296 which we assume is not depending on @xmath2 .",
    "again , we look for the best alignment score under all alignments with the prescribed number of gaps being @xmath30 and the gaps appear only in the sequence of @xmath0 s , thus we allow gaps to align with @xmath1 s .",
    "the highest alignment score among all alignments which align exactly @xmath30 letters of @xmath40 with gaps , but no letter of @xmath297 with gaps , is again denoted by @xmath298 when the number of gaps is fixed , in determining which alignment is optimal , the penalty for gaps does not matter much .",
    "indeed , the gap penalty will affect the optimal alignment only by a term of order @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , if we assume that the penalty of aligning a letter with a gap does not depend on the letter , we can simply assume that the gap penalty is actually equal to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the only part of the scoring functions which matters is the @xmath299 symmetric matrix @xmath300 the space of all such @xmath299 symmetric matrices constitute a @xmath78 dimensional space where a basis is formed by the matrices @xmath301 in addition , if we define two scoring matrices to be _ equivalent _ if the optimal alignments are the same , then it is easy to see that for any arbitrary scoring function @xmath169 , the scoring itself @xmath169 and @xmath302 are equivalent . thus the main task is to understand what happens under alignments with the scoring function @xmath303 .",
    "thus we assume for the rest of the section that the scoring function @xmath169 is equal to @xmath130 , so that : @xmath304 now , in the case considered here of a two dimensional alphabet , that scoring function can be viewed as a product scoring function by observing that if we introduce a numeric code for the letters , namely take @xmath144 to be @xmath305 and @xmath146 to be @xmath306 .",
    "then we find that @xmath307    using this in , the key observation is that the part @xmath33 has covariance given in formula by @xmath308=2cov(s(x_1,y_1),s(x_1,y_2)),\\ ] ] which in the present case becomes @xmath309=cov[x_1y_1,x_1y_2]=e[x_1 ^ 2y_1y_2]-e[x_1y_1]\\cdot e[x_1y_2]=\\\\ & = e[x_1 ^ 2]e[y_1]e[y_2]-e[x_1]e[y_1]\\cdot e[x_1]e[y_2]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to independence and mean @xmath69 of @xmath310 .",
    "hence , the term @xmath33 disappears from inequality for this choice of the scoring function .",
    "next , we notice that for a one dimensional `` uncorrelated '' random walk , the best coupling of the walk with a brownian motion in can be attained with @xmath311 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "with this choice of @xmath224 , the term @xmath312 in is of order @xmath313 , thus is much smaller than @xmath314 which is of order @xmath315 .",
    "however , since we have to correlate a large number of random walks ( exactly @xmath30 and not independent ) , we expect @xmath224 to be larger than @xmath316",
    ".    a different look at the dominating term on the right hand side of , gives that @xmath317 which is enough ( at least heuristically ) to guarantee that the rescaled optimal score is asymptotically tracy - widom .    in order to deal with the approximation of the random walk by brownian motions , we need to get good couplings of the random walk with brownian motions",
    "this is what we want to do next .",
    "we should also quickly mention , that at this stage , it should be heuristically clear why we should expect tracy - widom as limiting distribution as soon as the constant @xmath296 is small enough . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath296 is very small , then @xmath224 should be as `` close as we want '' to the formula for the one dimensional random walk with independent increments .",
    "now , for the one - dimensional random walk , it is known to allow a coupling to a brownian motion with @xmath311 .",
    "again , the only problem is to find a good coupling of the multidimensional random walk @xmath223 to a multidimensional brownian motion .",
    "the random walk @xmath223 has @xmath220 components .",
    "furthermore , there is dependency among the increments of the random walk .",
    "each step ( increment ) of the random walk , can depend on @xmath30 steps before and after .",
    "hence , @xmath223 is independent of @xmath318 for all @xmath319 .",
    "the main question is thus how well can a random walk with dependencies be approximated by brownian motion ? ( see @xcite for the one dimensional case , @xcite for severeal dimensions and @xcite for overviews . )",
    "is it possible to find such a coupling when the dimension of the random walk grows to infinity ?",
    "this is delicate as the constants involved depend on the dimension and thus are not very useful in our case .",
    "unfortunately we can not treat both problems simultaneously and it seems highly technical to deduce such a result in great generality .",
    "instead , we present here a simple approach for a simplified situation .",
    "first , we use the fact that our scoring function is a product .",
    "furthermore , _ for the rest of the paper we also assume the variables @xmath320 to be i.i.d .",
    "normal with @xmath321 instead of binary variables .",
    "the variables @xmath322 are still binary variables in this section with @xmath323 _    again , since @xmath324=0 $ ] the component @xmath37 in the equation dissapears .",
    "the normal assumption on @xmath1 s is in place here to simplify the calculations .",
    "we believe that macroscopically it amounts to the same as taking these variables binary .",
    "the fact that the variables @xmath320 are standard normal instead of binary has a very important consequence on the calculation side , namely , the optimal alignment still tries to align the maximum number of letter with the same sign and also will try to get that those @xmath250 s which get aligned with an @xmath62 of opposite sign to be small in absolute value .",
    "the key strategy of the proof is to condition on the sequence @xmath0 and exploit the normal structure of the @xmath1 . to set up the ground , let @xmath325 and let @xmath326 be a non - random binary vector .",
    "we are going to work conditional on @xmath327 .",
    "now , consider our random walk @xmath219 in the current case where @xmath328 .",
    "we have @xmath329 where @xmath330 and @xmath331 looking at the above expression for the random walk @xmath219 , we see that the steps are dependent but once we condition the @xmath62 s to be constants , i.e. @xmath327 and @xmath320 to be i.i.d @xmath332 , the @xmath333 s become independent normal vectors .",
    "hence , conditional on @xmath327 , we get that the multidimensional random walk @xmath219 has independent normal increment with expectation @xmath69 .",
    "this random walk is not yet a brownian motion restricted to discrete times but we are going to show that we can construct such a brownian motion which is a good approximation . in order to do this",
    "_ we consider at first the random walk @xmath223 restricted to the times @xmath334 which are a multiple of @xmath335=\\text{time - mesh size for coupling the random walk}\\ ] ] _ with some small @xmath336 which will be determined later and @xmath337 $ ] denoting the integer part of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we will consider @xmath338 where to simplify notation we assume @xmath2 to be a multiple of @xmath188 , though we can formally replace @xmath2 by @xmath339 with @xmath340 $ ] and run essentially the same argument .",
    "using the independence of the increments conditional on @xmath327 , we calculate the covariance matrix of the position of the random walk at time @xmath188 in the following way :",

    "now , using this , and the fact that @xmath342 is the covariance matrix of a standard @xmath220-dimensional brownian motion at time @xmath188 we will show that there is a coupling between the random walk and a standard brownian motion such that @xmath343 is close to the brownian motion position at time @xmath188 .",
    "moreover the argument can be extended to include also the increments of the random walk .",
    "more precisely , we show that the coupling can be chosen such that the increments @xmath344 are also close to the increment of the coupled brownian motion .    to construct such a coupling , we will build a brownian motion @xmath345 by coupling at the times @xmath346 at first .",
    "more precisely , we couple @xmath343 with @xmath347 , then the increment @xmath348 with the increment @xmath349 and then we continue coupling the next increment @xmath350 with @xmath351 and so on and each step we do this independently of the construction at the previous steps . recall that we do this conditionally on @xmath327 .",
    "the key is that the construction at each step is a consequence of lemma  [ coupling ] in the next section [ howto ] where we show how to couple a normal random variable having covariance close to a multiple of the identity .",
    "essentially the main assertion here is that if @xmath352 is a normal vector such that @xmath353 then we can find a normal vector @xmath354 of i.i.d normal components @xmath355 such that @xmath356 .",
    "here we use the operator norm @xmath357 for a matrix and measure the closeness in the operator norm , in particular all components of @xmath358 have variance at most @xmath359 .",
    "once all the increments @xmath360 are defined , we define @xmath361 for @xmath362 as the sum @xmath363 conditional on @xmath327 , the pieces @xmath364 for @xmath365 are independent .",
    "since @xmath366 depend only on , this implies that conditional on @xmath327 , the sequence of random vectors @xmath367 constitutes a multidimensional standard brownian motion restricted to the times @xmath368 .",
    "we can for instance use the construction of levy for the brownian motion to extend these vectors to a brownian motion such that the increments are given exactly by @xmath360 for @xmath369 .",
    "we do not look for other details about the brownian motion during the times @xmath370 $ ] , we will simply use some basic estimates for the maximum of brownian motions between these time intervals .",

    "indeed , @xmath128 and @xmath129 do not affect which alignment is optimal , thus , @xmath441 as argued before , @xmath442 depends only on the number of @xmath144 s and @xmath146 s in each of the sequences @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "thus , there is a larger normal part and tracy - widom on a lower scale .",

    "the main question to ask here is what happens if we allow the number of gaps to be of order @xmath447 which we leave as an open problem here . _",
    "the main coupling result is contained in the following lemma .    [ coupling ]",
    "let @xmath448 be a @xmath449-dimensional normal random vector with expectation @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath450 and @xmath451 .",
    "assume that latexmath:[\\[\\label{e : cov }    @xmath449-dimensional normal random vector @xmath453 with covariance matrix @xmath342 and expectation @xmath69 so that @xmath454|\\le\\epsilon.\\ ] ] in particular all the components of @xmath455 have variance at most @xmath359 .",
    "the main idea is to construct a normal vector simply by rescaling the vector @xmath448 .",
    "the construction uses the fact that if @xmath9 is a linear transformation from @xmath456 into itself , then @xmath457 is again a normal random variable of covariance matrix @xmath458 . in this framework",
    "we take @xmath459 and @xmath460 clearly , we now have @xmath461 furthermore , @xmath462=cov[(i - j^{1/2}\\sigma^{-1/2})\\vec{v}]=(i - j^{1/2}\\sigma^{-1/2})\\sigma(i - j^{1/2}\\sigma^{-1/2})=(\\sigma^{1/2}-j^{1/2})^{2}.\\ ] ] taking the eigenvalues of @xmath463 to be @xmath464 , the condition reads as @xmath465 on the other hand since @xmath466 , we also know have that @xmath467 .",
    "thus the conclusion is reached from the fact that the eigenvalues of @xmath468 are @xmath469 and the following chain of inequalities @xmath470      [ aj ] we have that @xmath393 has probability close to one . more precisely , assuming @xmath471 , then for any constant @xmath472 ,",
    "the following holds @xmath473    consider the sum on the right side of . instead of taking the full sum , we are going to split the sum in the following form @xmath474 where for simplicity we assume that @xmath188 is a lot larger than @xmath30 and that @xmath188 is a multiple of @xmath30 .    since for each @xmath475 ,",
    "the sequence @xmath476 are iid when @xmath79 runs from @xmath70 to @xmath477 .",
    "the covariance matrix of these vectors is the @xmath220-dimensional identity matrix @xmath270 .",

    "hence , expression [ sumo ] is approximately equal to @xmath270 and @xmath480    now , according to @xcite the precision of such an approximation in operator norm is the square root of the dimension times the square root of the sample size .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath481 here , @xmath482 is a constant which does not depend on @xmath188 .",

    "we have that when the event @xmath393 holds , then @xmath492 where @xmath270 is a @xmath220 dimensional identity matrix .",
    "so , our coupling of @xmath493 to @xmath494 is such that the covariance matrix of the difference has norm at most @xmath495 .",
    "thus , conditional on @xmath327 , and assuming @xmath393 holds , we get latexmath:[\\[\\label{differences }     this implies that the @xmath199-th component of the difference @xmath497 has a variance less or equal to @xmath495 .",
