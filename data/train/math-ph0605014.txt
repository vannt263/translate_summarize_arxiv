    "recent experimental results on carbon nanotubes using two photon photo luminescence  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite reveal the energy levels of the excitons , especially the ground and first excited states , and point out the dependence of these energies on the radius of the nanotube .",
    "as it is , this technique appears to be a promising way to sort out nanotubes .",
    "but on the other hand , theoretical results seem to require heavy ab initio calculation like in  @xcite  @xcite , to cite the most recent , in order to find the absorption peaks due to excitons . nevertheless , a simple formula for the optical response based on excitons levels  @xcite can give a good approximation .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite  @xcite that the exciton binding energy in quantum wires depends on the width of the wires by a relatively simple relation .",
    "this property is also valid for nanotubes  @xcite . in the first part of the paper , we outline a rigorous justification for this latter fact and write a simple analytic formula for the energy levels of the exciton depending on the radius of the tube , based on the paper  @xcite . in the second part",
    "we compare our results with a variational numerical method and show a very good agreement between them .",
    "as first suggested in  @xcite , we deal with wannier excitons ( a rigorous justification of this procedure is in preparation @xcite ) .",
    "we take as configuration space a cylinder of radius @xmath0 and infinite length , space denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the unit circle .",
    "the coordinates on the cylinder are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the variable along the tube axis and @xmath5 is the transverse coordinate .",
    "the two quasi - particles live in the hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "we formally consider the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 are the coordinates on the cylinder of the two charged particles , @xmath10 their masses , and @xmath11 their charges . here",
    "@xmath12 is the electric permittivity of the material .",
    "the potential @xmath13 is the three dimensional coulomb potential simply restricted to the cylinder .",
    "we justify the expression of @xmath13 by pythagoras s theorem .",
    "the cylinder is embedded in @xmath14 .",
    "the distance @xmath15 from one particle to the other in @xmath14 is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the length of the chord joining two points of coordinate @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the circle .      due to the restrictions imposed by the cylindrical geometry ,",
    "the usual separation of the center of mass does not work here .",
    "the standard separation with jacobi coordinates only works for the longitudinal variable , and introducing @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we denote @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for the transverse variable",
    ", we change to atomic coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let us also define the effective rydberg @xmath26 and bohr radius @xmath27 , where we set @xmath28 . by a scaling ,",
    "the new energy and radius will be expressed in multiple of these units .",
    "this gives us the hamiltonian : @xmath29 first , we can separate the partial center of mass with coordinate @xmath30 .",
    "second , since on the @xmath31 variable there are periodic boundary conditions , let us consider the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 one can see that for small radii , the separation between different transverse levels of energy is high .",
    "a recent theoretical study based on ab initio calculations  @xcite shows that the probability density of the exciton is constant along the circumference .",
    "so it is reasonable to assume that the radius is so small that the system stays in the ground state of @xmath32 , where @xmath35 and the density of probability is constant along the circumference .",
    "( note that this has been rigorously proved in @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", we can approximate the eigenfunctions @xmath36 of @xmath37 as : @xmath38 after this restriction to the lowest transverse mode , we only have to study the following operator : @xmath39 which is two dimensional and acts on @xmath40 .",
    "it will turn out that the limit @xmath41 is too singular and @xmath42 does not have a `` nice '' limit .",
    "it is suitable at this point to introduce the quadratic form associated to @xmath42 , defined on the sobolev space @xmath43 : @xmath44 reasoning as in the previous subsection , a good approximation of the behavior of eigenfunctions along the transverse variable when the radius is small is given by the ground state of the free laplacian with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "if we restrict the above quadratic form to functions of the type : @xmath45 we have : @xmath46 where @xmath47 for the sake of simplicity , we will put @xmath48 .",
    "let us introduce what will be our effective one - dimensional comparison operator : @xmath49 we now have reduced our problem of two particles on a cylinder to a one dimensional problem describing a particle interacting with an external potential .",
    "a complete and detailed mathematical justification of these steps can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now try to approximate as accurate as possible the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath50 when the radius is small . using the notation @xmath51 ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two smooth functions @xmath54 one can recognize in @xmath55 a form of the regularized one dimensional coulomb potential . in the following , our approach will be quite similar to the one of loudon  @xcite in the sense that we let the regularizing parameter tend to zero .",
    "note though that our parameter has a clear physical interpretation being given by the radius of the nanotube , and it is not just an artifact as in loudon s case .",
    "hence this will give us the exciton energies as functions of @xmath0 , and allow us to estimate the errors we make using this approximation .",
    "define the quadratic form @xmath56 by @xmath57 } \\frac{1}{|x|}\\cdot |f(x)|^2dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note the last equality is obtained by an integration by parts , and holds for all @xmath58 ; also note the appearance of a coulomb potential in one dimension . again from  @xcite we have @xmath59 now let us define a new `` potential '' via a quadratic form @xmath60 which is close to @xmath61 when @xmath0 is small and is exactly the coulomb potential when we look away from the origin .",
    "we will see in the following that this particular potential gives a solvable eigenvalue problem for the associated hamiltonian .      the operator @xmath62 we will now consider is given by its associated quadratic form defined on @xmath63 : @xmath64 one can recognize the kinetic energy in the first term and the potential @xmath65 in the second term .",
    "the general theory of closed symmetric quadratic forms gives us the existence of an associated operator @xmath62 defined by @xmath66 whenever @xmath36 is in the domain of @xmath62 .",
    "the difficulty here is that @xmath65 is not a usual schrdinger - type multiplication potential , but due to various sobolev embeddings it turns out that if @xmath36 is in the domain of @xmath62 then @xmath67 is square integrable outside the origin , and we still have : @xmath68 now if @xmath36 is an eigenfunction of @xmath62 corresponding to an energy @xmath69 , then it obeys the differential equation : @xmath70    in order to get the behavior at the origin of the eigenfunctions of @xmath62 , we integrate by parts and use . for @xmath58",
    "we have : @xmath71 where the last integral will converge to zero as @xmath12 goes to zero . on the other hand , @xmath72 } \\frac{1}{|x|}\\cdot \\overline{\\phi(x)}\\psi(x)dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then adding with , using and letting @xmath12 tend to zero ( see @xcite for technical details ) we have : @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now using and the eigenvalue equation @xmath74 we get the boundary condition : @xmath75=0.\\ ] ]      we now have to solve the equation @xmath76 with the boundary condition  . similarly to loudon in  @xcite , we introduce a dimensionless quantity @xmath77 and the change of variables @xmath78 then we obtain @xmath79 the solutions are known for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , see  @xcite for example .",
    "the second thing is to see what condition at @xmath82 should the eigenfunctions @xmath83 obey .",
    "if we scale  , @xmath84=0.\\ ] ] we only give here the results .",
    "details of calculations can be found in  @xcite . if we take the only square integrable solution , we have two cases : if @xmath85 is a positive integer , then the eigenstates are the odd functions @xmath86 with associated eigenvalues @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "notice that these energies are independent of the radius of the tube .",
    "if @xmath77 is not an integer , the eigenstates are the even functions @xmath91 with associated eigenvalues @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the smallest integer larger than @xmath77 and : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a normalizing constant , @xmath96 is the whittaker function and @xmath97 is the confluent hypergeometric function or kummer function of the second kind .",
    "we denote with @xmath98 and @xmath99 the usual gamma and digamma functions , and we get from   that for even solutions @xmath77 must satisfy the relation : @xmath100 from this relation , which contains an implicit expression for @xmath101 , one can deduce several important facts . for all integers @xmath102 and for @xmath77 in between @xmath102 and @xmath103 ,",
    "there is only one solution of   satisfying the boundary condition .",
    "furthermore , the energies associated with the non integer @xmath77 tend to their closest lower integer when @xmath0 tends to zero .",
    "a special case is the one of the ground state @xmath104 of the exciton which tends to minus infinity as the radius tends to zero .",
    "the behavior for small @xmath0 is @xmath105    notice that equation   is exactly what one gets by explicitly calculating the condition requiring the derivative of even states to vanish at the origin , relation  ( 3.22 ) in loudon s paper , and replacing his parameter @xmath106 by @xmath107 , for small @xmath0 .",
    "we can also compare with the result from  @xcite where banyai et al .",
    "found numerically @xmath108 for the exciton problem in a quantum wire of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the energies associated to the exciton are drawn on figure  [ figenergy ] and we calculated numerically the lowest four eigenvalues with respect to the radius on figure  [ comparisonfiga ] , along with a comparison of the ground state given by the variational method of  @xcite . on figure  [ comparisonfigb ]",
    "a zoom was made around the first and second excited states .",
    "one can notice that the odd states possess a constant energy , independent of the radius .",
    "this is due to the fact that the odd states vanish at zero where there is the singularity of the potential .",
    "indeed , the potential becomes , for an odd function @xmath109 : @xmath110 which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the variational method operates by minimizing the energy of a trial function and is therefore usually applied to approximate the ground state .",
    "however , by restricting the trial function to forms that are orthogonal to the ground state , low lying excited states can be obtained variationally as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the variational method was applied to the ground state and in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar approach was applied to calculate the @xmath111 oscillator strength of interest for two - photon absorption .",
    "the @xmath111 state is especially important because this state is used for excitation in two - photon fluorescence measurements @xcite . by recording the energy of photons emitted from the lowest ( @xmath112 ) exciton , a direct measure of the @xmath113 energy difference",
    "is obtained . in turn , the @xmath112 exciton binding energy ( i.e the 1s excitation energy measured relative to the band gap ) can be derived if a reliable model for the exciton energy spectrum is invoked .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to compare results of the relatively complicated variational approach to the straight - forward and analytical coulomb model .",
    "hence , in the following we briefly explain the reasoning behind our variational estimate of the lowest excited ( @xmath111 ) state . in practical applications",
    ", the trial function must be sufficiently simple that calculation of the energy is manageable .",
    "this implies that relatively few adjustable parameters should be considered .",
    "at the same time , a certain flexibility is required to provide reasonable accuracy . a useful strategy consists in constructing trial functions so that they correctly accommodate the known solutions in limiting cases of the general problem .",
    "thus , we are guided by the analytical solution for the plane , i.e. for nanotube radii much larger than the effective bohr radius . in our units ,",
    "this state is simply @xmath114 . on the other hand , in the extreme 1d limit",
    "we expect @xmath115 . to accommodate both limits , we consequently suggest the ( un - normalized ) trial form @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are variational parameters to be determined by minimizing the expectation value of the energy . this expectation value is found as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath102 are the kinetic energy , potential energy and normalization constant , respectively .",
    "the integrations are quite cumbersome and only @xmath120 and @xmath102 can be obtained in closed form in terms of struve and modified bessel functions .",
    "the potential energy @xmath121 is evaluated numerically using gaussian quadrature .    the minimized energy as a function of radius @xmath0 is illustrated in fig . [ varia2p ] .",
    "state energy as a function of nanotube radius .",
    "inset : the @xmath0-dependence of decay lengths @xmath118 and @xmath117 of the trial wave function.,width=377 ]    the limiting values are @xmath122 and @xmath123 for small and large @xmath0 , respectively , in agreement with the analytic solutions in these limits . in between these limits ,",
    "the curve interpolates smoothly between the limiting values and the dominant correction at small @xmath0 is @xmath124 .    in order to judge the usefulness of the different approaches used in the present work it is essential to determine the appropriate nanotube radius @xmath0 in excitonic units , i.e. in units of @xmath125 .",
    "an important point in this respect is that , in fact , @xmath125 varies between different nanotubes .",
    "the relation needed for conversion is @xmath126 , where @xmath12 is the dielectric constant screening the coulomb interaction and @xmath127 is the reduced effective mass .",
    "whereas @xmath12 may be assumed the same for all nanotubes , @xmath127 must be derived from the curvature of the band structure and , hence , depends on both radius and chirality of the nanotube .",
    "however , detailed studies @xcite show that @xmath125 is roughly proportional to the nanotube diameter and as a consequence @xmath0 ( in units of @xmath125 ) is nearly constant and given by @xmath128 if @xmath129 .",
    "it should be noted , though , that in media with little screening a larger @xmath130 is expected .",
    "the smallness of @xmath0 means that approximations based on expansion around @xmath131 are expected to be accurate .    in figure [ comparisonfiga ] and [ comparisonfigb ] ,",
    "a comparison of variational energies and the results of the coulomb model is given .",
    "in both the @xmath112 and @xmath111 cases , reasonable agreement between the two approaches is found around @xmath128 . also , in both cases , the variational result lies slightly higher than the coulomb model .",
    "the ground state has deviated by more than @xmath132 from the plane value for radii around @xmath133 .",
    "an error of less than @xmath134 is seen between the curves at this point .",
    "note that if the curve from the coulomb model is lower in energy than the variational one , this does not means that the approximation is better .",
    "although in the variational approach the lower is the better since the exact solution is always below the variational result , in the coulomb model the exact value is somewhere around the approximation , bounded by an error bound . in this work",
    "the error bound was not calculated because , unfortunately , the compromises made to get a simple formula implied a difficult calculus to optimize on the bound , even by numerical computations . for the first excited state ,",
    "the coulomb model approximation for the energy is independent of the radius of the tube .",
    "this must be a good approximation for very small radii .",
    "however , this approximation becomes increasingly inaccurate as the radius increases , as the exact value should tend to the energy of the problem on the plane with energy equal to @xmath135 as do the variational curve .",
    "state is equal to the one of the first @xmath136 state at zero . in red : graph of the ground state computed with the variational method on the cylinder from  @xcite.,width=377 ]     state showing both variational and coulomb model results .",
    "in addition , the @xmath137 state obtained with coulomb model is included for comparison.,width=377 ]",
    "the coulomb model applied to excitons in carbon nanotubes demonstrates that the energy associated with each even state decreases to the energy of its closest odd state as the radius tends to zero .",
    "since each odd state energy is independent of the size of the tube in this approach , all energies associated to excited states stay in the range @xmath138 ( in effective rydberg energy units ) .",
    "so only the ground state diverges when the radius gets smaller .",
    "this is confirmed by the behavior of the first variational excited state which converges to @xmath139 .",
    "the simple exciton model proposed in this paper and studied both by means of rigorous perturbation theory and by a variational approach is a good starting point for attacking the difficult problem of electron - electron interactions in low dimensional structures such as carbon nanotubes .",
