    "the galactic population of pulsars is still poorly known in the inner parts of our galaxy .",
    "studies of the galactic structure ( e.g.  bahcall 1986 , gilmore et al .",
    "1989 ) and studies of the radial distribution of pulsars ( e.g.  lyne et al .",
    "1985 ) however , suggest that a large number of pulsars await discovery in the inner spiral arms .",
    "unfortunately , selection effects imposed by the interstellar medium make the discovery of such pulsars difficult .",
    "first , the interaction of the broadband pulsed radio signal with the ionised component of the interstellar medium causes the effect of dispersion , delaying signals observed at lower frequencies relative to their higher frequency counterparts ( hewish et al .",
    "the dispersive delay is inversely proportional to the square of the observing frequency , the constant of proportionality being the column density of the free electrons between earth and the pulsar , known as the dispersion measure ( dm ) . without a correction for this effect , the recorded pulse becomes smeared and eventually undetectable .",
    "secondly , the pulse also becomes broadened due to interstellar multi - path scattering as the free electron distribution in the turbulent interstellar medium is inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "scattering is especially severe at low frequencies , since the scattering time is proportional to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the observational frequency and @xmath11 ( lhmer et al .",
    "2004 ) . unlike dispersion",
    ", scattering can not be removed by instrumental means .",
    "both effects are particularly severe for high dm pulsars .",
    "another factor that mitigates against low frequency surveys is that at low galactic latitudes , the background ( synchrotron ) radiation has an effective temperature , t@xmath12 , which dominates t@xmath13 at low frequencies with a dependence which varies as approximately @xmath14 .",
    "any pulsar survey therefore needs to balance the above effects against the fact that pulsars are intrinsically brighter at low frequencies and the larger telescope beam at lower frequencies reduces the survey time for a given area .",
    "population studies take these selection effects into account and a recent population study by lorimer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that , using the electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) , a dearth of pulsars exist in the inner galaxy . as uncertainties in the electron model remain ( cf .",
    "kramer et al .",
    "2003 , lorimer et al .",
    "2006 ) a high - frequency survey is the only direct way to shed light on the population of pulsars in the inner galaxy , as was previously demonstrated by the pioneering use of high frequencies in pulsar surveys by clifton & lyne ( 1986 ) .",
    "this is particularly true for the studies of young pulsars which are especially important for our understanding of birthrates derived in these population studies .",
    "indeed , for young pulsars still residing near their birth place in the galactic plane , the aforementioned selection effects are extremely severe as they are typically spinning fast .",
    "these considerations were the motivation to conduct a survey of the inner galactic plane at an unusually high frequency of 6.3 ghz , of which the first results are presented here .",
    "the new survey utilises a seven beam receiver that was built in collaboration between jodrell bank observatory and the australia telescope national facility , operating at a wavelength around 5 cm , to search the galaxy for emission of methanol masers .",
    "exploiting this `` methanol multi - beam '' ( mmb ) receiver ( each beam with a width of 0.11 deg ) allows us to rapidly cover the inner galactic plane at a central observing frequency of 6306mhz , with a bandwidth of 576mhz , which is indeed much higher than for usual pulsar surveys . as a result",
    ", we expect the survey to discover a sample of new pulsars that is dominated by young objects .",
    "we report here the first discovery of the mmb survey which , in accordance with the expectations , is a young , energetic pulsar . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline the parameters of the mmb survey and in section 3 discuss the pulsar s parameters and its discovery .",
    "section 4 discuss the likely association between the pulsar and the unidentified @xmath7-ray point source , 3eg j1410@xmath06147 .",
    "the survey of the galactic plane for pulsars using the mmb receiver on the parkes radio telescope commenced in february 2006 .",
    "full details will be given elsewhere , therefore we will only summarise its basic characteristics now .",
    "the survey used a * 192-channel filterbank , with a channel width of 3  mhz for a total of 576mhz centred at * 6306mhz , * to cover * an area of 40 square degrees , ranging from a longitude of @xmath15 and a latitude range of @xmath16 .",
    "the integration time of 1055  s is modest and a compromise between survey speed and sensitivity . *",
    "assuming a duty cycle of 5% and with a system noise of 60 jy , the average limiting detectable flux density is 0.1 mjy . *",
    "all data are * 1-bit * sampled at 0.125  ms , written to tape and analysed off - line using standard algorithms which search for short- and long - period pulsars , as well as for short radio bursts and bright single pulses ( see lorimer & kramer 2005 for details ) .",
    "currently , 94% of all survey pointings have been observed ; their full analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "wide survey observations at the pulsar s location were carried out on 2007 april 18 and subsequent processing revealed a promising candidate with a pulse period of 50  ms and a dm of @xmath8800@xmath4pc with a signal@xmath0to@xmath0noise ratio of 12.6 .",
    "observations were made of the same area of sky using the same observing setup on 2007 september 9 and the pulsations were confirmed ( see figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) . in the following days",
    ", observations were made at 1.4 and 3.1  ghz using a digital backend capable of recording full stokes parameters .",
    "further timing observations have been carried out since , and additional polarimetric observations were made at 6.4  ghz .    the top part of table  [ timing ] gives the measured pulsar parameters obtained from a coherent timing solution using 24 independent measurements made over a time span of 98  days .",
    "the dm is measured from the time delay and the rm obtained from the position angle variation with frequency across the 1  ghz band at 3.1  ghz .",
    "errors given in parentheses refer to the last quoted digit and are twice the formal standard error .",
    "the bottom part of the table gives the derived parameters where the distance has been computed from the dm and the cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) electron density model and the other parameters using standard equations ( lorimer & kramer 2005 ) .",

    "as a young object , it is the sixth shortest period non - recycled pulsar , is one of only 12 pulsars with @xmath17ergs@xmath2 and ranks in the top 50 when sorted by age .",
    "its dm , refined from the initial survey estimate , is also very large , especially considering its displacement of 48@xmath18 from the galactic centre .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the rotation measure ( rm ) of @xmath19 rad m@xmath6 is also unusually large for this longitude , and in fact , it is the largest for any known pulsar ; nearly all other pulsars in the vicinity have large negative rms and extragalactic sources also have large negative rms in this area of sky @xcite .",
    "the rm in conjunction with the dm gives the mean value of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight as 3.1  @xmath20 g .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol ] shows the polarisation profiles of the pulsar at 3.1 and 6.2  ghz . the first point to notice",
    "is the scatter broadening at the lower frequency and indeed at 1.4  ghz ( not shown ) the profile is exceedingly broadened by interstellar scattering . under the assumption of kolmogorov turbulence , the time constant of the scatter broadening should vary with frequency like @xmath21 with a scattering power law index @xmath22 .",
    "following lhmer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , fits were made to the scattering tails of the pulses of psr  j1410@xmath06132 as a function of frequency , at 1.4 ghz and across the 3.1  ghz band . the result shown in figure",
    "[ fig : scattail ] leads to an scattering power law index of @xmath23 , significantly flatter than expected but in line with values seen in other high dm pulsars ( lhmer et al .",
    "we only obtain an upper limit for the seemingly unscattered profile at 6.2  ghz which is rather narrow with a full width of only 14 .",
    "the linear polarisation is relatively high , especially across the leading part of the profile .",
    "the position angle of the linear polarisation swings through @xmath880  across the profile . the narrow pulse width and the relatively flat gradient of position angle swing",

    "we have therefore corrected the measured flux density of 4  mjy to 6  mjy to compensate for this effect . *",
    "the flux density spectrum , @xmath24 , at 1.5 , 3.0 and 6.3 ghz , has a power law index of @xmath25 which is somewhat flatter than the mean power law index of @xmath26 derived from a large sample of pulsars ( maron et al .",
    "psr  j1410@xmath06132 is a young , highly energetic pulsar and it is located within the positional error box of a previously unidentified @xmath7-ray point source , 3eg j1410@xmath06147 .",
    "there are currently over 100 unidentified @xmath7-ray sources resulting from the @xmath7-ray sky survey with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) , aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , which was performed from 1991 until 1999 in the energy range 100 mev to 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the nature of these unidentified point sources has been debated for some time and many attempts have been made to find corresponding counterparts at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "those that have been identified include solar flares , @xmath7-ray bursts , normal galaxies , active galactic nuclei and pulsars .",
    "pulsars are of particular interest because they have a similar spatial distribution as the unidentified egret point sources and have been positively identified as being @xmath7-ray emitters , e.g. the crab and vela pulsars . indeed",
    ", emission theories for pulsars predict @xmath7-ray emission in particular for young pulsars in either so called `` outer gap '' or `` polar cap '' models ( see e.g.  harding 2005 for a recent review ) .",
    "in addition to seven pulsars clearly identified as @xmath7-ray sources due to their detected _ pulsed _ emission , several more possible pulsar associations have been made with egret sources , often motivated by positional coincidences ( e.g.  camilo et al .",

    "however , due to the large positional errors of most @xmath7-ray sources ( of the order of 1@xmath18 ) , it is often difficult to be certain if the association is real and final confirmation may need the detection of corresponding pulsed emission using the new @xmath7-ray satellites like agile or the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) .",
