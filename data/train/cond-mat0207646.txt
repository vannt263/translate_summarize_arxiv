    "the high - t@xmath0 superconductor bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 shows a remarkably strong absorption in the microwave regime , even far below @xmath3@xcite . in conventional , low - t@xmath0 , s - wave superconductors",
    ", there is no such background , because there is no absorption below the energy gap for pair excitations , @xmath4 .",
    "but in high - t@xmath0 materials , which are thought to have a @xmath5 order parameter , the gap vanishes in certain nodal @xmath6 directions .",
    "hence , gapless nodal quasiparticles can be excited , and hence can absorb microwave radiation , at arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "however , experiment suggests that this absorption is much stronger than expected from the quasiparticles alone@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that such extra absorption can be produced if the superfluid density @xmath7 within the @xmath8 plane is a function of position @xmath9 .",
    "such spatial variation can be produced , e. g. , by quenched disorder , or by charge density waves ( e. g. stripes ) .",
    "the extra absorption is most likely in the microwave frequency range .",
    "a similar absorption was found by us in a previous paper@xcite , in which the inhomogeneity was described as static fluctuations in the josephson coupling between superconducting grains .",
    "we consider a two - fluid model of a superconductor in two dimensions , with local conductivity @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is twice the electron mass @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is assumed spatially varying , while @xmath15 is taken to be spatially uniform .",
    "we wish to calculate the complex effective conductivity @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath15 might be a contribution from the nodal quasiparticles , while @xmath17 represents the perfect - conductivity response of the superconductor",
    ". it can be spatially varying because of the very short in - plane coherence length .",
    "we employ the kramers - kronig relations satisfied by @xmath16 , namely @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where p means `` principal part of , '' @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the effective superfluid density [ the value of @xmath22 can be found from the residue of @xmath16 at @xmath23 . at very large frequencies",

    "then at high frequencies , the _ local _ complex conductivity , @xmath29 , has only small spatial fluctuations .",
    "then@xcite @xmath30 @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a space average . since only @xmath17 , and not @xmath15 , is fluctuating , this expression simplifies to _ e _ + + . [",
    "eq : sigma_e_const ] at large @xmath24 , the imaginary part of @xmath35 to leading order in @xmath36 is simply @xmath37 . equating this expression to the right - hand side of the kramers - kronig expression for @xmath25",

    "that is , the extra integrated fluctuation contribution to @xmath46 , is proportional to the average superfluid density .",
    "a similar result has been reported in experiments@xcite .      for a drude @xmath47",
    ", we can carry out a similar analysis@xcite . in the case of weak fluctuations in @xmath17 , the result is@xcite @xmath48d\\omega^\\prime \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\approx",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath49 , this expression reduces to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sige1p ] ) .",
    "thus , in this regime , the extra spectral weight is indeed proportional to the average superfluid density @xmath45 .",
    "next , we consider a _ tensor _ superfluid density , as would be expected in a superconducting layer containing quenched charge density waves such as a charge stripes@xcite . in this case",
    ", the ( @xmath50 ) superfluid density tensor should have the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a diagonal @xmath50 matrix with diagonal components @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is a position - dependent @xmath56 rotation matrix . describing the relative orientation of the charge density wave or stripes .",
    "if the stripes have either of two orientations along the crystal axes of the layer , with equal probability , then the _ effective _ superfluid density @xmath21 will be a scalar .",
    "the arguments of the previous subsections can readily be transferred to the tensor case .",
    "for a two - fluid model with a frequency - independent quasiparticle conductivity which has the same value @xmath57 in both the @xmath58 and @xmath59 directions , the effective scalar conductivity @xmath16 again satisfies kramers - kronig relations , and one again obtains the sum rule ( [ eq : sige1 ] ) , where @xmath45 is now the rotational average of a diagonal element of @xmath60 . if the principal axes of @xmath60 point with equal probability along the two symmetry directions of the cuo@xmath1 plane , as mentioned above , @xmath61 .",
    "likewise , if the principal axes were to point in any direction in the plane with equal probability ( a circumstance which seems unlikely for a stripe phase ) , then it can be shown@xcite that once again @xmath61 .",
    "if the quasiparticle conductivity is frequency - dependent , then the analogous scalar results of the previous section continue to hold . for example , if @xmath62 , then the extra spectral weight due to the superfluid inhomogeneity is again given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) in the weak - inhomogeneity regime .    in the case of the stripe geometry , where the principal axes of the conductivity tensor take either of two perpendicular orientations with equal probability , @xmath21 is given by the duality result@xcite @xmath63 this form allows the extra spectral weight to be evaluated straightforwardly , given @xmath27 , without making the small fluctuation approximation .",
    "as a simple example , we consider a superconducting layer in which the conductivity has one of two possible values , @xmath64 or @xmath65 with equal probability , and we assume @xmath66 , where we take @xmath67 .",
    "this model would be suitable either for a layer with static scalar disorder , or for a model of stripe domains , as discussed above .",
    "we also write @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "we also assume @xmath70 for @xmath71 or @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is a parameter describing the superfluid inhomogeneity ( this form ensures that @xmath79 ) .",
    "our choice of temperature dependence for @xmath80 ensures that @xmath81 ( i ) decreases linearly with increasing temperature @xmath82 at small @xmath82 , as observed experimentally@xcite ; and ( ii ) vanishes at a critical temperature @xmath3 as @xmath83 . the ingredients of this model are very similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , and have a straightforward interpretation .",
    "first , @xmath84 should be proportional to @xmath82 in a gapless @xmath85-wave superconductor@xcite , and hence @xmath21 should be depleted by the same amount and fall off linearly in @xmath82 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath53 and @xmath54 individually are linear in @xmath82 .",
    "the form @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is another constant@xcite , has been observed for nodal quasiparticles in the superconducting states@xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath35 using bruggeman effective - medium approximation ( ema)@xcite , which gives @xmath88 .",
    "the solution to this equation is simply @xmath89 .",
    "1 shows the resulting @xmath90 for several frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 thz , the range measured in ref.@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath87 were taken from ref.@xcite , and we assumed @xmath94 . also shown are @xmath95 for @xmath96thz and @xmath97thz .",
    "finally , we plot @xmath98 for these frequencies , as well as @xmath99 .",
    "clearly , @xmath100 is considerably increased beyond the quasiparticle contribution , because of spatial fluctuations in the superfluid density .",
    "we have shown that a superconducting layer with an inhomogeneous superfluid density will have an extra absorption not present in a homogeneous superconductor .",
    "the frequency integral of @xmath100 associated with this absorption is proportional to the superfluid density , in general agreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "we have also shown that this inhomogeneity , and hence the extra absorption seen in experiments , can arise from a stripe domain structure , as well as from random but isotropic disorder .",
    "thus , we speculate that no such extra absorption should be observed in a high - t@xmath0 superconductor unless one of these two types of inhomogeneities are present ( beyond that expected purely from nodal quasiparticle absorption ) .",
