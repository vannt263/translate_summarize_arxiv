    "investigations of the implications of a possible ` incompleteness ' of quantum mechanics(qm ) have resulted in striking discoveries of fundamental constraints which any realist model has to satisfy in order to be compatible with the empirically verifiable predictions of qm .",
    "one of such constraints is , of course , the comprehensively studied incompatibility between qm and the local realist models of quantum phenomena discovered using bell s theorem@xcite and its variants@xcite - for a comparatively recent review of investigations in this area , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the other constraint that , of late , has also been attracting an increasing attention is the one concerning the inconsistency between qm and the noncontextual realist(ncr ) models(the bell - kochen - specker theorem@xcite and its variants[8 - 26 ] ) .",
    "it is this latter strand of study which leads to the present paper . for this , we proceed by first recapitulating the essence of what is usually meant by the notion of ` noncontextuality ' .    given any realist hidden variable model of quantum phenomena , the individual measured values of any dynamical variable are predetermined by the appropriate values of hidden variables(@xmath0 s ) which are used in a realist model for a ` complete specification ' of the state of an individual quantum system .",
    "now , the condition of ` noncontextuality ' , in its most general form underlying its usual use , stipulates that the predetermined individual measured value of any dynamical variable , for a given @xmath0 , is the _ same _ whatever be the way the relevant dynamical variable is measured .",
    "the question as to what extent this putative condition is compatible with the formalism of qm has been subjected to two different lines of study by exploring the implications of two separate facets of this condition .",
    "one of these is contingent upon assuming that the predetermined individual measured value of a given dynamical variable is independent of whatever be the choice of the other commuting(comeasurable ) observable that is measured along with it .",
    "this condition has led to the formulation of a testable bell - type inequality@xcite that is derived as a consequence of the ncr models , but is violated by qm for the entangled states by a finite amount , thereby enabling an empirical discrimination between qm and the ncr models@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the experimental investigation along this line has been enriched by further studies@xcite .",
    "the other line of study on the issue of contextuality vis - a - vis qm is based upon a feature characterising the ncr models that can be expressed as follows : for an individual measurement , the definite outcome obtained for an observable(say , @xmath1 ) , as specified by a given hidden variable @xmath0 , be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "now , let @xmath3 be any other commuting(comeasurable)observable whose measured value in an individual measurement , as fixed by the _ same _ given @xmath0 , be denoted by @xmath4 . then ,",
    "if one denotes an individual outcome of a holistic measurement of the product observable @xmath5 by @xmath6 which is determined by the _",
    "same _ value of the hidden variable @xmath0 , the notion of noncontextuality is taken to imply the following condition(known as the ` product rule ' ) @xmath7 which is assumed to hold good independent of the experimental procedure(context ) used for measuring the joint observable @xmath5 in a holistic way , and is also independent of the way the individual separate measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath3 are performed separately .",
    "this feature of noncontextuality was elegantly used by mermin@xcite for formulating a proof of quantum incompatibility with the ncr models for two spin-1/2 particles that holds for _ any _ state .",
    "later , cabello@xcite cast mermin s proof@xcite in the form of a testable inequality involving the statistically measurable quantities - this inequality being violated by qm by a finite measurable amount for an _ arbitrary _ two - qubit state .",
    "subsequently , the state - independent quantum violation of this inequality has been experimentally corroborated using the polarization and the linear momentum degrees of freedom of a single photon@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above two directions of study , in this paper we explore a third line of probing , initiated in a recent paper@xcite that used a suitable path - spin entangled state of a spin-1/2 particle , in which the issue of contextuality is probed _ within _ the framework of qm , devoid of any reference to the ncr models . with a view of extending the ambit of this new line of study , the present paper reveals that that it is indeed possible to show a form of _ state - independent _ contextuality _ within _ qm for _ any _ state that is an entangled or a product state in the four dimensional space . by using photons and an appropriate setup",
    "we show that a statistically discernible effect of the path - polarization interdependence is manifested in terms of the operationally suitably defined _",
    "subensemble _ statistical properties of an arbitrary polarization measurement that depend upon the choice of a comeasurable(commuting)path observable .",
    "interestingly , this context - dependence gets obliterated for the statistical results pertaining to the _ whole ensemble _ of photons emerging from the setup used for the polarization measurement , whatever be the choice of the comeasurable path observable .",
    "let us now proceed by first explaining the specifics of the setup(figure 1 ) that is required for our demonstration .",
    "in order to formulate our argument , the required path - polarization product state can be prepared using a 50:50 beam splitter(bs1 ) , while an entangled path - polarization state can be prepared by using a 50:50 bs1 in conjunction with a half wave plate(hwp ) that is placed in one of the output ports of the bs1(fig.1 ) .",
    "the relevant path and the polarization measurements will be considered separately for these prepared states .",
    "let us consider that an ensemble of photons having horizontal polarized state @xmath8 be incident on a 50:50 beam - splitter(bs1 ) .",
    "any given incident photon can then emerge along either the reflected or the transmitted channel corresponding to the state designated by @xmath9 or @xmath10 respectively . here",
    "note that for any given lossless beam - splitter , arguments using the unitarity condition show that for the photons incident on bs1 , the phase shift between the transmitted and the reflected states of photons is essentially @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the prepared path - polarization product state after emerging from bs1 can then be written as @xmath12    on the other hand , for preparing an entangled path - polarization state , photons in the channel corresponding to @xmath13 are passed through a hwp that flips the polarization @xmath8 to @xmath14 .",
    "the state emerging from hwp can then be written as @xmath15 which is an entangled state between the path and the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "in writing both eqs.([pr ] ) and ( [ en ] ) we have taken into account a relative phase shift of @xmath11 between the states @xmath16 and @xmath10 that arises because of the reflection from bs1 .",
    "eqs.([pr ] ) and ( [ en ] ) represent the prepared states on which we will _ separately _ consider the relevant path and the polarization measurements for the purpose of showing the path - polarization interdependence for the product as well as for the entangled state . for this",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "-0.5 cm    -2.0 cm",
    "after passing through the mirrors m1 and m2 , photons are subjected to a phase shifter(ps ) along the channel @xmath16 which introduces a relative phase shift of @xmath17 between the path channels @xmath16 and @xmath10 .",
    "the two path states are then recombined at bs2 , and the output path states @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively given by    @xmath20    eqs.([psi34],[psi344 ] ) show that , for a given linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath16 , using the different values of @xmath17 , one can unitarily generate at the output of bs2 various linear combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath16 that correspond to different probability amplitudes of finding photons in the channels corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that ps in conjunction with bs2 can be regarded as corresponding to different choices of the path observables @xmath21 with eigenvalues @xmath22 .",
    "such observables , in terms of actual measurements , correspond to different relative counts registered by the detectors placed along the channels represented by @xmath18 and @xmath19 . using eqs.([psi34],[psi344 ] )",
    "the path observable is of the form @xmath23 that can be written as the following linear combination of the pauli matrices @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "it is , therefore , evident from eq.(5 ) that the path observable @xmath26 which is represented by the vector component given by eq.(6 ) varies according to the magnitude of the phase shift @xmath17 , i.e. , different choices of @xmath17 provide different contexts pertaining to the polarization measurements .",
    "next , we consider the measurement of an arbitrarily chosen polarization variable , say , @xmath27 which is given by @xmath28 whose eigenstates are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the orientation of the two polarizers that are placed separately along the channels @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    now",
    ", we will consider the expectation value of the polarization observable @xmath32 that involves contributions from both the output subensembles corresponding to polarizers _ separately _ placed along the channels @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the _ subensemble mean values _ of @xmath33 measured in each of the two output channels , calculated using either the prepared product or an entangled path - polarization state given by eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively , are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , whence @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 represents the prepared entangled or product states given by eq.(2 ) or ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "note that all the three quantities occurring in the equality given by eq.([meansub ] ) have the same operational status as far as their _ statistical reproducibility _ is concerned .",
    "but there is a crucial distinction between the left and the right hand sides of eq.([meansub ] ) with respect to the issue of path - polarization interdependence .",
    "the quantity on the left hand side of eq.([meansub ] ) , the expectation value of @xmath38 pertaining to the whole ensemble , is _ independent _ of which path observable is measured along with it . on the other hand , each of the quantities on the right hand side of eq.([meansub ] ) , the subensemble mean values denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 are contingent upon the choice of the comeasurable path observable .",
    "this can be seen by considering the polarization measurement outcomes relevant to any one of the two output subensembles .    in order to display the manifestation of this form of context - dependence within qm , we consider two different experiments involving measurements of the path observable @xmath26 and the polarization variable @xmath32 , first for the prepared product state given by eq.(2 ) , and",
    "then for the prepared entangled state given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "we first consider the path - polarization product state given by eq.(2 ) as the input state for which the state that emerges from bs2 can be written as @xmath41\\left|h\\right\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then it follows that the expectation value of the polarization observable @xmath33 pertaining to the _ whole ensemble _ of photons emerging from bs2 is of the form    @xmath42    which comprises the respective subensemble polarization mean values calculated from eq.(9 ) given by @xmath43    next , we come to the crux of our argument indicated as follows that hinges on two different choices of @xmath17 , and where the superscript @xmath44(@xmath45 ) is used to denote the choice of the path observable specifying the given context :    @xmath46 taking @xmath47 , this implies the choice of a particular path observable @xmath48 where @xmath49 . in this case , using eq.(11 ) , we obtain    @xmath50    while , using eq.(2 ) , the polarization expectation value for the whole ensemble , @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 taking @xmath53 , this implies the choice of a different path observable @xmath54 where @xmath55 . consequently , using eq.(11 ) , we obtain    @xmath56    while , using eq.(2 ) , the polarization expectation value for the whole ensemble remains the _ same _ , @xmath51 .",
    "it is then evident from eqs.(10 - 13 ) that , while the quantum expectation value @xmath57 of the observable @xmath33 pertaining to the _ whole ensemble _ remains the _ same _ for both the choices of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the path - polarization context - dependence gets manifested in terms of the _ subensemble polarization mean values _ given by the testable quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 . to put it precisely , in our example ,",
    "the interdependence between the path and the polarization degrees of freedom has the following operational meaning @xmath62    i.e. , the subensemble mean value of the polarization variable @xmath32 depends upon _ which _ of the path observables @xmath58 or @xmath59 is comeasured , where both @xmath58 and @xmath59 commute with @xmath32 .",
    "now , we consider the path - polarization entangled state given by eq.(3 ) as the input state for which the state that emerges from bs2 can be written as    @xmath63\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it follows from eq.(15 ) that corresponding to the prepared path - polarization entangled state @xmath64 given by eq.(3 ) , the expectation value of the polarization variable @xmath33 for the _ whole ensemble _ of photons emerging from the beam - splitter bs2 is given by    @xmath65    which is made up of the respective subensemble polarization mean values calculated from eq.(15 ) , which are of the form    @xmath66    then , similar to the argument given above for the input product state , in this case too eq.(14 ) holds good , i.e. , the path - polarization context - dependence gets manifested in terms of the _ subensemble polarization mean values _ given by the testable quantities @xmath60 and @xmath60 , while the quantum expectation value @xmath67 pertaining to the _ whole ensemble _ remains the _ same _ for both the choices of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the essence of what is demonstrated in this paper is as follows .",
    "a statistically discernible signature of interdependence between the path and the polarization degrees of freedom of polarized photons is revealed - an effect which is quantum mechanically calculable in terms of the measured values of a polarization variable pertaining to the operationally well - defined _ subensembles _ that comprise the final output ensemble at the two exit channels of our setup .",
    "the subensemble polarization mean value registered at either of the two exit channels _ varies _ according to the choice of the comeasurable(commuting ) path observable(whose choice is fixed by the magnitude of the phase shift that is introduced by ps in the channel @xmath16 ) but , importantly , such a variation takes place by _ preserving _ the context - independence of the polarization expectation value that is defined for the whole output ensemble .    in other words , we show that for an arbitrarily prepared state that can be either a path - polarization entangled or a product state , a form of ` parameter dependence ' is displayed in this example in a way that is restricted to the _",
    "subensemble statistics_. this is quite distinct from the issue of ` parameter independence'@xcite for the epr - bohm type states involving the polarization variables of two spatially separated photons where the ` parameter independence ' is in the sense that _ no _ statistically discernible effect in any form can be detected in any one of the two wings of the epr - bohm pair that depends upon the measurement setting in the other wing - a possibility which is ruled out by the much - discussed ` no - signaling ' condition@xcite .",
    "but , in contrast , in our example , for an arbitrary input state considered in our example for a polarized photon , there is no such constraint which forbids the statistical manifestation of an intraparticle path - polarization context - dependence .",
    "while such an effect does occur in our example , curiously , it is confined to the subensemble statistics in such a way that the ` path - polarization interdependence ' disappears for the statistics of the whole ensemble .    in terms of the two distinct aspects of the ncr models",
    "as discussed earlier , we may recall that the statistically verifiable inequalities for the entangled as well as the product states have been analyzed , both theoretically and experimentally , thereby highlighting an incompatibility between qm and the ncr models .",
    "however , it needs to be stressed that these earlier demonstrations necessarily involve the assumption of the notion of realism that is used in tandem with the feature of noncontextuality at the level of individual measurement outcomes .",
    "in contrast , the statistically verifiable manifestation of the quantum mechanical ` path - polarization interdependence ' shown in this paper is entirely _ independent _ of any notion of ` realism ' or ` hidden - variables ' , because this effect is demonstrated essentially within the ambit of qm and , crucially , is independent of the nature of the input state which can be either a path - polarization product or an entangled state .",
    "a significant point to stress here is that a similar effect of interdependence showing a nonlocal connection between the entangled variables of the spatially separated photons can not be demonstrated within qm unless one takes recourse to the notion of ` realism ' or ` hidden - variables ' .",
    "this fundamental distinction between quantum nonlocality and contextuality brought out by the example analyzed in this paper as well as in an earlier work@xcite call for careful probing .",
    "such investigations may provide useful insights into the type of constraints that would restrict the nonlocal realist models in the light of the recent studies@xcite based on leggett s work@xcite .",
