    "theoretical analysis of the properties of strongly interacting hot and dense matter is a hard problem .",
    "even when the density of baryons in thermal equilibrium is negligible , perturbative qcd calculations are only reliable at temperatures which are much higher than the temperature of the deconfinement transition  @xcite . while lattice simulations can provide an account of equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the theory , questions involving real - time dynamics such as momentum transport , thermalization , and various production rates are much harder to answer . for near - equilibrium states , physical information is contained in equilibrium response functions : for example , the dilepton rate is proportional to the spectral function of vector currents , and the viscosities are determined by the spectral function of the relevant components of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "thus it is valuable to study models where analytic results for the real - time response functions can be derived . a number of recent studies focused on a particular model , the @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath2 yang - mills ( sym ) theory at finite temperature .",
    "the interest in this theory is due to maldacena s gauge - string duality conjecture @xcite which provides an effective description of the theory s non - perturbative regime in terms of semiclassical gravity in a five - dimensional asymptotically anti de sitter space .",
    "the sym theory is conformal , and has only one tunable parameter , the t  hooft coupling @xmath3 .",
    "thermal equilibrium is characterized by the black - body equation of state at any non - zero temperature , and can not ( at large t  hooft coupling ) be viewed as a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "the standard hydrodynamic singularities in two - point functions of conserved currents in sym theory were found from the dual gravity description in the limit of large @xmath3 and large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the shear viscosity to volume entropy density in this theory has been found to be @xmath4 @xcite , which is a much smaller number than the corresponding result in a weakly coupled gauge theory .    in this paper , we focus on the full spectral functions ( rather than their small - frequency limit ) of the stress - energy tensor in the sym theory at large t  hooft coupling and large @xmath1 .",
    "the knowledge of the full spectral function is important for two reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "our results provide the first example of a non - perturbative spectral function calculation in a strongly coupled four - dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature , obtained without performing lattice simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - perturbative spectral functions of sym theory may be useful for lattice computations of transport coefficients in realistic gauge theories at temperatures not too far from the deconfinement transition .",
    "indeed , a euclidean correlation function ( computed on the lattice ) is proportional to the integral of the real - time spectral function over all frequencies . in the simplest method of reconstructing the spectral function from the euclidean data ,",
    "one first assumes an ansatz for the spectral function , and then fits the parameters of the ansatz to the lattice data @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to the computation of the shear viscosity in qcd @xcite .",
    "theoretical understanding of what the correct non - perturbative ansatz might be is of primary importance for this approach .",
    "our results for the non - perturbative spectral functions of sym theory may therefore prove useful for lattice studies of transport processes in thermal gauge theories .",

    "the shear and bulk viscosities are proportional to the zero - frequency slope of the specific components of the spectral function , for example , @xmath10 the retarded correlation function of the stress - energy tensor of sym theory admits a simple decomposition ( we follow the notational conventions of ref .",

    "hooft coupling , the three scalar functions @xmath31 can be computed using the gauge - gravity duality recipe @xcite .",
    "the duality essentially reduces the computation of a two - point correlation function to a boundary - value problem for a linear ordinary differential equation .",
    "for the zero - temperature theory , the retarded two - point function can be found for example in @xcite sym theory coincides with the one obtained in free field theory , due to a non - renormalization theorem @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath32 in order to compute the retarded correlators at non - zero temperature , one has to analyze the `` wave equations '' ( one for each symmetry channel ) which describe propagation of the corresponding metric perturbations in the ads - schwarzschild background spacetime of the dual description .",
    "the differential equations are of the form @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 [ to be specified shortly ] depend on the dimensionless frequency @xmath36 and momentum @xmath37 , and @xmath38 labels the three symmetry channels .",
    "the coordinate @xmath39 ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 corresponds to the boundary of the asymptotically ads spacetime , and @xmath43 corresponds to the event horizon of the background .",
    "for all three equations ( [ eq : master - equation ] ) , the characteristic exponents at @xmath42 are equal to @xmath40 and @xmath44 , and the exponents at @xmath43 are @xmath45 .",
    "information about the retarded correlation function is encoded in the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : master - equation ] ) which satisfy the incoming wave condition at the horizon , corresponding to the exponent @xmath46 at @xmath43 .",
    "the correct solution is thus of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a regular function at the horizon .",
    "the solution satisfying the incoming - wave condition at the horizon can be written as a linear combination of two independent local solutions at @xmath42 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by their standard frobenius expansions @xcite as @xmath52 all the coefficients @xmath53 ( except @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 are determined by the recursion relations obtained by substituting the above expansion in the differential equation ( [ eq : master - equation ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath54 is left as a free parameter , reflecting the fact that one can always redefine the local solutions by adding a constant multiple of @xmath51 to @xmath50 . without loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath56 thus fixing the definition of @xmath57 .",
    "the retarded functions @xmath58 are then given by @xmath59 as is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ frob1 ] ) , ( [ frob2 ] ) , the coefficient @xmath60 is given by the boundary value of the solution , @xmath61 , while the coefficient @xmath62 can be expressed in terms of the boundary value of the second derivative of the solution , @xmath63 from the recursion relations one determines @xmath64 , which is an analytic function of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and therefore represents a contact term which we drop .",
    "the retarded correlator is therefore equal to @xmath67",
