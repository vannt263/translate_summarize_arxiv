    "absorption line systems at redshifts close to the emission redshift of the qso against which they are viewed have traditionally been considered to be somewhat different from the bulk of the truly intervening absorbers and , for this reason , are normally excluded from statistical studies of qso absorption spectra .",
    "possible differences of these so - called ` proximate ' systems compared to ` normal ' ones may include : ( i )  they could be produced by material ejected by the quasar or in the host galaxy interstellar medium ; ( ii )  their degree of ionization may be influenced by the proximity of the quasar s radiation field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( iii )  environmental effects could come into play if the quasars are located in overdense regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such reservations also apply to damped lyman alpha systems , the absorbers at the upper end of the distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities with @xmath12(hi)@xmath13@xmath14 @xcite , if located close to the qso redshift .",
    "indeed , a recent study by @xcite has found that the number density of dlas almost doubles in the vicinity of qsos ( within 6000kms@xmath3  of the emission redshift ) , leading those authors to speculate that the excess may result from galaxies in the same cluster or supercluster as the quasar .",
    "while it may therefore be justified to exclude proximate damped systems , or pdlas , when considering the statistical properties of dlas as a whole , the very fact that they may be a different population makes them interesting in their own right .",
    "can we learn more about the quasar environment from pdlas ?",
    "are their chemical properties different from those of intervening dlas ?",
    "supersolar metal abundances have been claimed for gas close to quasar nuclei @xcite and for high ionization associated systems @xcite , but such estimates are much more model dependent than the relatively straightforward determination of element abundances in dlas ( see the discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "of course there is no reason to assume that all pdlas have the same origin , and therefore similar properties ; indeed some may simply be chance alignments , comparable to the intervening absorbers , while others could form part of the same group or cluster as the qso , with perhaps only a small fraction originating from the host galaxy itself .",
    "until recently there have been very few studies of pdlas , partly because these systems are relatively rare ( since dlas themselves are rare systems ) , but also because they have often been ignored . while the handful of known cases was boosted slightly with the corals survey by @xcite , it is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that is offering the greatest opportunity to significantly increase the sample size ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". consequently it should soon be possible to examine more generally the statistical properties of the pdla population .",
    "the few pdlas studied to date have been found to be broadly similar to other dlas , although there is some evidence of enhanced ly@xmath9  emission @xcite .",
    "this emission has been attributed to various causes including ( i )  photoionization from the quasar , ( ii )  the reduced line blanketing from the ly@xmath9  forest , due to the proximity effect , and ( iii )  increased star formation in the quasar environment ( either directly through gravitational interaction or indirectly due to the fact that quasar activity tends to be located near to galaxies that are actively forming stars ) .",
    "the similarity with intervening dlas also appears to extend to the chemical properties of the few pdlas studied so far , which do not appear to be statistically different from the rest of the population of damped absorbers @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with all of these comparisons , however , is the uncertainty by up to several thousand kms@xmath3  in the systemic redshifts of the bright quasars against which pdlas have been observed ; without knowledge of the qso true redshift , it is not possible to establish whether a proximate system is associated with the qso environment or is located tens of mpc in front of it .",

    "the qso and its associated dla were discovered in the course of a survey for galaxies at @xmath28 in the field of the previously known , brighter ( @xmath29 ) quasar q2343 + 1232 at a similar redshift ( @xmath30 ) ; the aim of the survey is to study the connection between star - forming galaxies and the absorption seen in qso spectra at redshifts @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the discovery spectrum of q2343bx415 , obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the kecki telescope , revealed the presence of a strong damped ly@xmath9 line essentially coincident in redshift with the ly@xmath9 emission line , raising the possibility that this pdla may be associated with the host galaxy of the qso . whatever its origin , pdlas so close in redshift to the background qso are very rare and warrant further study .",
    "we therefore secured further observations of q2343bx415 with the keckii telescope , in the optical with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ? * ) and in the near infrared with the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the purpose of studying in detail the chemical and kinematic properties of the pdla and establishing its relationship to the qso itself .",
    "these observations are the subject of the present paper , which is organized as follows . in  [ sec : observations ] we briefly describe the esi observations and the steps in the data reduction process . in  [ sec : spectrum_bx415 ] we give an overall description of the optical spectrum of q2343bx415 , measure its systemic redshift from the near - ir observations , and derive the column density of the pdla by decomposing the ly@xmath9  line into its emission and absorption components . in  [ sec : kinematics ] we discuss the kinematics of the metal absorption lines associated with the pdla , which are found to consist of two sets of components , one redshifted and the other one blueshifted relative to @xmath32 .",
    "measurements pertaining to the two sets of components are collected in table  [ tab : table_dla_ew ] . ",
    "[ sec : abundances ] deals with the derivation of the abundances of 14 elements in the pdla , while  [ sec : partial_coverage ] and  [ sec : ionization_corrections ] examine critically how these abundance determinations may be compromised by , respectively , partial coverage of the qso continuum by the absorbing gas and the presence of ( partly ) ionized gas . in  [ sec : cii * ] we use the ratio @xmath12(cii@xmath5)/@xmath12(hi ) to deduce a conservative limit to the physical distance between the pdla and q2343bx415 .",
    "we bring all of these findings together in the discussion of  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in addition to the pdla , our esi spectrum of q2343bx415 includes absorption lines from 11 intervening absorption systems at @xmath33 .",
    "we catalog them in appendix  [ sec : intervening_systems ] , where we also compare their redshifts to those of galaxies within @xmath11arcmin of the line of sight to q2343bx415 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36kms@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 .",
    "esi is a highly suitable instrument for observations of absorption systems in faint qsos , offering a combination of high efficiency , wide wavelength coverage ( from 4000 to 10500  spread over ten spectral orders ) and a moderately high spectral dispersion of 11.5kms@xmath3  per 15@xmath37 m detector pixel .",
    "we observed q2343bx415 on the nights of 4 and 5 september 2002 for a total exposure time of 15,600s ( four 3600s + one 1200s exposures ) .",
    "the atmospheric conditions were mostly clear with seeing of @xmath38arcsec fwhm ; the spectrograph slit width was set at @xmath39arcsec projecting to @xmath40 ccd pixels .",
    "the individual esi exposures were reduced with purpose - written iraf tasks , which implement the conventional steps of bias subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray rejection and background subtraction prior to co - adding the individual one - dimensional spectra .",
    "wavelength calibration used the reference spectra of cu - ar and hg - xe - ne lamps , and an absolute flux scale was provided by observations of the standard star g191b2b @xcite .",
    "the intrinsically smooth spectrum of this white dwarf also allowed us to correct for telluric absorption at red wavelengths .. ] finally , the qso spectrum was mapped onto a vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale . for the purpose of studying absorption lines , we fitted the qso intrinsic spectrum with a spline curve , paying special attention to the fit around the strong emission lines on which resonance absorption lines from the same transition are superposed ; division by this spline fit then provided a normalized spectrum suitable for absorption line measurements .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the data varies from s / n@xmath41 to @xmath42 per 0.25  wavelength bin over the interval 50009250 , being higher in the qso broad emission lines and in the center of spectral orders , and lower in the continuum and at the edges of orders .",
    "it falls to s / n@xmath43 by 4250  in the blue and 10,000  in the red .",
    "the spectral resolution is fwhm@xmath44kms@xmath3 , sampled with @xmath40 ccd pixels .",
    "the reduced esi spectrum of q2343bx415 before normalization is reproduced in figure[fig : plot_bx415_slope ] . in the rest frame of the qso , at @xmath45 ( see  [ subsec : systemic_redshift ] ) , our data extend from @xmath46 to 2900  and include all the familiar ultraviolet emission lines , from ly@xmath9 to mgii  @xmath47 .",
    "the strong absorption trough that is superposed on the ly@xmath9  emission indicates the presence of a proximate - dla ( see  [ subsec : p - dla ] ) .",
    "the numerous sharp absorption lines , which are resolved when the spectrum is plotted at higher resolution , correspond to metal absorption lines from the pdla and from numerous other intervening systems at lower redshifts .",

    "the broad similarity between the two spectra suggests that q2343bx415 is a fairly typical quasar .",
    "there are differences too , however . in q2343bx415 ,",
    "the civ  @xmath49 and mgii  @xmath47 emission lines are stronger , the feii broad emission at wavelengths @xmath50is also stronger , and there are narrow uv emission lines which , as explained below , help us pin down the systemic redshift of the qso .      as we are interested in investigating the relationship between the pdla and the qso , it is important to determine accurately their respective redshifts .",
    "it has been known for a number of years that in quasars the broad permitted and semi - forbidden emission lines are not at the systemic redshift , but are blueshifted by up to several thousand kms@xmath3   ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the blueshift is different for different ion stages and shows a strong correlation with ionization energy .    on the other hand , the narrow forbidden lines and the balmer lines are closer to the systemic redshift , with shifts of less than 100kms@xmath3  @xcite . in order to measure the redshifts of the [ oiii ]  @xmath51 doublet and h@xmath18",

    "the absorption systems in the optical spectrum of q2343 + 1232 have been catalogued by @xcite .",

    "the decomposition of the profile into its components is made easier by the high s / n of the esi data and the requirement that , once the emission line is divided out , the remaining absorption should exhibit the characteristic lorentzian shape of the damping wings .    to perform our decomposition , we first subtracted out a fit to the quasar s underlying continuum level , then used the residual spectrum for an initial estimate of the shape and intensity of the ly@xmath9emission line profile .",
    "to characterise this emission , we used the elf ( emission line fitting ) routines in the starlink dipso data analysis package @xcite to fit this estimate with a ( multi - component ) gaussian fit . by dividing the original spectrum by the sum of the quasar s continuum and this emission line fit , it was possible to compare the resulting normalised absorption spectrum with theoretical profiles of damped ly@xmath9  lines of varying hi column density , generated by the dipso routine hc .",

    "first we consider the higher ionization aliii lines , for which we can directly compare the profiles of both blueshifted and redshifted absorption .",
    "if the discrepancy observed in the _ weaker _ redshifted component were due to saturation , the stronger blueshifted components would also be saturated and should display discrepancies in the line profiles , in contrast with what is observed .",
    "it therefore appears that the third , redshifted , component of the moderately ionized gas suffers from partial coverage .",
    "of course we can not be certain that the lower ionization gas is spatially coincident with the higher ionization gas .",
    "nevertheless it seems unlikely that the discrepancies in @xmath149 observed for the low ionization gas are due to saturation as no discrepancy is seen for the main component of si  iv  @xmath162  ( see fig  [ fig : plot_odm_high ] ) , which has a comparable optical depth to the third components of some of the siii and mgii lines .    to summarize",
    ", it appears that the geometrical distribution of the blueshifted and redshifted absorptions are different , with the former totally covering the qso continuum and broad line emitting regions , while the latter only does so partially or inhomogeneously . if a significant fraction of the neutral gas resided in the redshifted component c3 , the element abundances we deduced in  [ subsec : abundances ] may have been underestimated .",
    "fortunately , c3 accounts for negligible amounts of the ions that are dominant in hi regions . based on the lines with the lowest values of @xmath148 in which c3 is seen ( these are the lines where the effect of partial coverage on the derivation of the column density is minimized )",

    "\\(1 ) we have obtained a high signal - to - noise ratio , medium resolution , spectrum of the faint qso q2343bx415 motivated by the presence of a strong dla coincident in redshift with the qso .",
    "our intention was to investigate gas in the vicinity of the quasar ; in particular , if the dla arises in the host galaxy of q2343bx415 it would allow a more comprehensive characterization of its chemical composition than is normally possible with other techniques that are based either on high ionization absorption systems at @xmath227 or on the analysis of emission lines from the agn .",
    "unlike previous studies of other proximate systems , we are aided by the precise knowledge of both absorption and emission redshifts , the former from metal lines in the dla and the latter from narrow emission lines in the rest - frame optical and uv spectrum of q2343bx415 .",

    "these velocities are of the same order of magnitude as those often encountered within star - forming galaxies at @xmath229 ; in particular the shift of @xmath93kms@xmath3  of the bulk of the neutral gas is the same as the mean offset between uv absorption lines and h@xmath9 emission measured in nearly one hundred bx galaxies at @xmath2302.6 by steidel et al .",

    "this in turn implies that it is possible to deduce element abundances without significant corrections for unobserved ion stages .",
    "\\(5 ) the presence of cii@xmath5 in the pdla gives a measure of the uv radiation field longward of the lyman continuum , under the assumption of equilibrium between the cooling rate via [ cii ]  @xmath231 m emission and photoelectric heating from grains .",
    "the value of @xmath232 we deduce , adopting the radiation transfer formalism of @xcite , is @xmath142 to @xmath233 times greater than the metagalactic radiation field of @xcite , depending on the temperature of the gas .",

    ". the relatively strong cii@xmath5 absorption could be due to _ in situ _ star formation .",
    "however , this picture requires _ two _ velocity matches to be coincidental : not only between the redshifts of the absorber and the quasar host , but also between the neutral gas in the dla and the high ions  particularly nv  which in this picture would have to located in a separate region from the neutral interstellar medium of the dla galaxy .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the dla is physically associated with q2343bx415 , then our observations indicate that the gas is outflowing from the host galaxy of the quasar with velocities and other properties that are very much in line with those of the ` superwinds ' seen in most star - forming galaxies at comparable redshifts .",
    "the placement of the neutral gas at a few tens of kpc from the active nucleus ( from the cii@xmath5 analysis ) is suggestive of a shell of swept - up interstellar material .",
    "its relatively low metallicity ( compared with those typically encountered in the star - forming regions of uv - bright galaxies ) may be an indication that the host galaxy is fainter and of lower mass than most bx galaxies studied so far  and yet still harbors an agn .",
    "however , the low aliii / alii ratio implies that the dla must somehow be shielded from the ionizing radiation from the active nucleus .",
    "regardless of the uncertain origin of the pdla itself , we have probably detected gas associated with the agn in the ( mostly ionized ) redshifted components , which have less than 100% covering factor . while it would be very interesting to examine the metallicity of these intrinsic absorbers  and compare it to that of the emission line gas  both determinations would be much more model - dependent than the straightforward measurement of dla abundances on which we have focused in this paper .    in closing , while we have not been able to establish conclusively the origin of the pdla , observations as detailed as the ones presented here still emphasize the importance of further studies of proximate dlas as probes of the environments of quasars at early times .",
    "comparison of their properties and physical conditions with those of the ` field ' population of dlas will help us understand better the nature of dlas at large , as well as add to our knowledge of the galaxies , or groups of galaxies , that host agn .",

    "if any of the 17 galaxies at redshifts less or equal to that of the quasar are associated with any of the 11 intervening absorption systems , we need to establish : ( a ) the systemic redshift , @xmath250 , of candidate absorbing galaxies , and ( b ) the plausible redshift difference @xmath251 between the systemic redshift of a galaxy and the absorption redshift of any absorption line system that would still allow us to plausibly associate the former with the latter .",

    "s8 has a low probability counterpart , while s2 , s6 , s7 , s9 , s10 and s11 do not have any catalogued galaxies at the right redshifts .",
    "this could be due to the incompleteness of our photometric and spectroscopic catalogs , or maybe the galaxies responsible for these absorbers are fainter than @xmath240 .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the finding that there are four galaxies at impact parameters @xmath266kpc , q2343bx434 , q2343bx417 , q2343bx390 , and q2343bx435 , that apparently do not produce absorption lines even to the relatively high sensitivity limit of our esi spectrum ( corresponding to a @xmath76 equivalent width limit @xmath267m ) .",
    "however , on closer inspection of the spectrum , we find that certainly in two ( and marginally in three ) of these cases , the corresponding civ absorption lines could be blended with other spectral features , which would make it hard to recognize them , while for q2343bx435 we find a tentative detection of a weak civ doublet at @xmath268",
    ".    a final comment concerns the fact that our as yet incomplete spectroscopic survey has already identified four galaxies that are at redshifts close to that of q2343bx415 ; these galaxies are indicated by red squares in figure  [ fig:2343_field ] . while their impact parameters are too large to associate any of them with the pdla , they do attest to the fact that q2343bx415 is part of a large scale structure which includes bright star - forming galaxies as well as the bright quasar q2343 + 1232 .",
