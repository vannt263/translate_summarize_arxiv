    "non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most compelling problems of modern cosmology . despite the fact that its existence is well established by cosmological and astrophysical probes ,",
    "its nature remains elusive .",
    "still , observations can constraint the properties of dark matter and give some hints about its identity .",
    "for instance , a fundamental requirement for a viable dark matter candidate is the stability over cosmological times .",
    "this suggests the existence of an exact or slightly - broken symmetry protecting or suppresing its decay .",
    "it has been shown recently that such symmetry can also be related to the flavor structure of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the model proposed in  @xcite is based on a @xmath1 symmetry with four @xmath2 higgs doublets .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath1 ( even permutation of four objects ) group is spontaneously broken into a @xmath0 subgroup which is responsible for the dm stability . the leptonic sector is also extended .",
    "it consist in four right handed neutrinos and the light neutrino masses are generated through the type - i seesaw mechanism and obey an inverted hierarchy mass spectrum with @xmath3 and vanishing reactor angle @xmath4 .",
    "we have also been consider models with a different matter content for the right handed neutrinos with the same dm stability mechanism but with different neutrino phenomenology  @xcite or a model based on the dihedral group @xmath5 where the some flavour changing neutral currents are present and constraint the dm sector  @xcite .",
    "other models with flavor symmetries but with decaying dm have also been considered , see for instance  @xcite . for a model with stable dm but with the same behavior of the dm , in the sense that instead of being inert totally , the dm couples to some right handed neutrinos in a similar way in our model",
    "is broken into the @xmath0 symmetry . ]",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the model consist on the sm matter fields plus three higgs doublets which transform as a triplet under @xmath1 , and four right handed neutrinos transforming as a singlet and a triplet of the flavor group . in table  [ tab1 ] we present the relevant quantum numbers for the matter fields .",
    ".summary of relevant model quantum numbers [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the group of even permutations of four objects , @xmath1 , has two generators : @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , which obeys the properties @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath6 is a @xmath0 generator while @xmath7 is a @xmath9 generator .",
    "@xmath1 has four irreducible representations , three singlets @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and one triplet .",
    "the generators of @xmath1 for each irreducible representation are @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the model is @xmath15 this way @xmath16 is responsible for quark and charged lepton masses , the latter automatically diagonal .",
    "neutrino masses arise from @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "one solution for the minimum of the higgs potential  @xcite is @xmath18 which means the vev alignment for the @xmath1 triplet of the form @xmath19 .",
    "this alignment is invariant under the @xmath6 generator is in the @xmath10 representation of @xmath1 and its vev also respect the generator @xmath6 .",
    "] , see eq .",
    "( [ generators ] ) , which means that the minimum of the potential breaks spontaneously @xmath1 into a @xmath0 subgroup generated by @xmath6 .",
    "all the fields in the model singlets under @xmath1 are even under the residual @xmath0 , the triplets transform as : @xmath20 the dm candidate is the lightest particle charged under @xmath0 i.e. the lightest combination of the scalars @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which we will denote generically by @xmath23 .",
    "we list below all interactions of @xmath23 :    1 .   yukawa interactions @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "higgs - vector boson couplings @xmath26 3 .",
    "scalar interactions from the higgs potential : @xmath27    after electroweak symmetry breaking , the vevs of the higgs fields acquire vacuum expectation values , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the singlet and the first component of the triplet respectively .",
    "additional terms are obtained from those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pint ] ) by replacing @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these vertices are relevant for direct detection  @xcite see figure  [ diagram ] .",
    "the phenomenology of dark matter of this model has been studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the model accommodates wmap and collider constraits and is consistent with xenon100 and cdms on one hand and cogent or dama on the other hand  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the model contains four heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it is a special case , called ( 3,4 ) , of the general type - i seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , it is characterized by dirac and majorana mass - matrix : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively proportional to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 of eq.([lag ] ) and are of the order of the electroweak scale , while @xmath39 are assumed to be close to the unification scale .",
    "light neutrinos get majorana masses by means of the type - i seesaw relation and the light - neutrinos mass matrix has the form : @xmath40 this texture of the light neutrino mass matrix has a null eigenvalue @xmath41 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath42 implying a vanishing reactor mixing angle @xmath43 and inverse hierarchy .",
    "the model implies a neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass parameter in the range 0.03 to 0.05  ev at 3  @xmath44 , within reach of upcoming experiments .",
    "we have studied a model where the stability of the dark matter particle arises from a flavor symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 non - abelian discrete group accounts for both the observed pattern of neutrino mixing and for dm stability .",
    "we have analyzed the constraints that follow from electroweak precision tests , collider searches and perturbativity .",
    "we have also analyzed the prospects for direct and indirect dark matter detection and found that , although the former already excludes a large region in parameter space , we can not constrain the mass of the dm candidate .",
    "in contrast , indirect dm detection is not yet sensitive enough to probe our predictions .",
    "however , forecasted sensitivities indicate that fermi - lat should start probing them in the near future .",
    "all of the above relies mainly on the properties of the scalar sector responsible for the breaking of the gauge and flavor symmetries .",
    "the motivation of our approach is to link the origin of dark matter to the origin of neutrino mass and the understanding of the pattern of neutrino mixing , two of the most outstanding challenges in particle physics today . at this level",
    "one may ask what are the possible tests of this idea in the neutrino sector .",
    "we found an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , hence a neutrinoless double beta decay rate accessible to upcoming searches , while @xmath4 giving no cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "note however that the connection of dark matter to neutrino properties depends strongly on how the symmetry breaking sector couples to the leptons .",
