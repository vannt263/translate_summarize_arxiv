    ", cmes may occur without flares , and flares may occur without cmes . however , the association rate is a steeply increasing function of the goes flare class , and in the strongest events typically both occur together .",
    "@xcite performed a careful statistical study on the cme - flare association , taking into account the varying visibility of the thomson - scattered white - light emission from the cme structure depending on its direction of propagation with respect to the line - of - sight of the observing spacecraft .",
    "the resulting association rate of cmes with flares is about 40% for m1 flares , 75% for x1 flares and approaches almost 100% for flares of class x2 and above ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  1 in @xcite @xcite ) .    however , noaa active region ( ar ) 12192 , which rotated onto the visible solar hemisphere on 17 october 2014 , revealed a strong contrast to this trend .",
    "it developed to the largest ar on the sun since noaa 6368 in november 1990 , and turned out to be very distinct in its activity .",
    "ar  12192 was the most flare prolific ar in the present solar cycle  24 , being the source of 6 x - class flares and 29 m - class flares in addition to numerous smaller events . however , all of the major flares it produced ( _ i.e. _ all x - class flares and all m - class flares except one ) were _ confined _ events , _",
    "i.e. _ they were _ not _ associated with a cme ( for nomenclature we refer to * ? ? ?",
    "the only eruptions launched from ar  12192 were a narrow cme that occurred in association with the m4.0 flare on 24 october 2014 @xcite and a cme that occurred on 14 october 2014 when the ar was still behind the east limb .",
    "this event was associated with a system of huge post - flare loop arcades reaching up to heights of 0.5 solar radii @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite studied ar  12192 in order to understand why it produced only confined flares .",
    "they all arrive at the conclusion that the major reason for the confinement is the strong ( external ) field overlying the ar core , where the flares took place , and its small decay index denoting that the horizontal magnetic field is only slowly decreasing with height .",
    "this finding is in line with previous studies of confined m- and x - class flares @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the decay of the background coronal magnetic field as function of height is a decisive factor for the torus instability , in determining whether or not the instability of a flux rope can result in an eruption ( leading to a cme ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite report that while the core field of ar 12192 was very strong , it showed weaker non - potentiality and smaller flare - related magnetic - field changes compared to other ars that produced cme - associated x - class flares ( for comparison , they studied ars 11429 and 11158 ) .",
    "@xcite studied the x3.1 ( 24 october 2014 ) , the x1.6 ( 22 october ) , and two m - class flares ( including the eruptive m4.0 event on 24 october ) produced by ar  12192 .",
    "they point out that the confined m- and x - class flares took place in the core of the ar , whereas the single eruptive m - class flare was located on the southern border of the ar , close to neighboring open field regions .",
    "all confined flares under study showed a large initial separation of the two conjugate ribbons , indicating that the energy release took place high in the corona , but they showed no separation motion during the flare evolution .",
    "the lack of flare ribbon separation seems to be a general feature of confined flares @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of the x1.6 flare of 22 october 2014 revealed further interesting features : the hard x - ray ( hxr ) spectrum is very steep ( @xmath5 ) , and the total kinetic energy in flare - accelerated electrons derived ( @xmath6  j ) is statistically an order of magnitude larger than in eruptive flares of goes class x1 ( _ cf .",
    "in addition , @xcite also identified repeated brightenings at certain locations of the flare ribbons during the impulsive phase , which was interpreted as evidence that the same magnetic - field structures were multiply involved in the energy - release process .    in the present article",

    "@xcite generalized this relationship to three dimensions and showed that the surface magnetic flux swept by the flare ribbons relates to a global reconnection rate , describing the total voltage drop along a magnetic separator line .",
    "because of initial line tying , the change of the photospheric field during the flare evolution is small [ @xmath12 , and the magnetic - flux change rate [ @xmath13 can thus be derived from the observations as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the newly brightened flare area at each instant and @xmath9 the normal component of the photospheric magnetic - field strength encompassed by @xmath15 .",
    "this relation reflects the conservation of magnetic flux from the coronal reconnection site to the lower atmosphere where the bulk of the flare energy is deposited , causing the characteristic flare - ribbon brightening .",
    "the magnetic - flux change rate [ @xmath13 defined in equation  [ eq_magrec_2 ] is a global reconnection rate ( in contrast to the local reconnection rate in equation  [ eq_magrec ] ) , and gives the rate at which magnetic flux from formerly separated magnetic domains is unified via reconnection . in eruptive flares",

    "@xmath35 for @xmath36 , this gives the total magnetic flux that was reconnected during the flare .",
    "in the data analysis , we follow the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "the newly brightened flare area in an image compared to the preceding time steps is determined separately for each magnetic - polarity domain .",
    "first , we determine for each image series the smallest intensity maximum [ @xmath37 , which is typically found in a pre - flare image .",
    "then we apply a set of potential scaling factors to @xmath38 in order to find a suitable threshold ( lower boundary ) for identifying flare pixels .",
    "too high thresholds will omit fainter parts of the flare ribbons , whereas too low thresholds will also include non - flaring bright pixels .",
    "we visually cross - checked the outcome for different threshold levels within the selected range , and found that for the h@xmath0 and ca  ii  k filtergrams @xmath39 provides an appropriate threshold .",
    "this basically means that the flare threshold is set at a level of 10% above the brightest plage regions in the image sequence . for the aia  1600   data",
    "the situation was somewhat different , as during the whole series small - scale transient brightenings occurred in the ar under study .",
    "thus the threshold derived corresponds to @xmath40 of the images series ; in absolute values this is at 1590  dn .",
    "however , note that in this case @xmath38 does not relate to the brightness of plage regions but of transient brightenings .",
    "@xcite tested various thresholds within a reasonable range and found that the derived @xmath41 curves show a similar evolution , whereas the peak values may differ by 5 to 15% .    to be identified as a newly brightened flare pixel , the following criteria have to be fulfilled : i ) the intensity value of a pixel exceeds the given flare threshold ; ii ) the pixel was _ not _ identified as flare pixel in any preceding image ; iii ) the pixel is located inside the currently studied magnetic polarity domain and exceeds the noise level of the hmi los magnetograms of about @xmath4210  g. for the aia 1600   image series , which is affected by blooming during the peak of the flare , we add the additional criterion iv ) that the intensity of a pixel lies above the flare - intensity threshold for at least six consecutive images ( _ i.e. _ over a duration about two minutes ) .",
    "blooming occurs when the charge in a ccd pixel exceeds the saturation level , and thus this additional charge spreads into neighboring pixels .",
    "this causes erroneously enhanced values or even saturation of neighboring pixels .",
    "since ccd sensors are often designed to allow easy transport of charges in vertical direction whereas in horizontal direction the flow is reduced by potential barriers , blooming typically appears as a characteristic white vertical streak in the images ( _ e.g. _ figure  [ f1 ] , third panel in left column ) .",
    "however , since blooming is often only present in the few brightest images , whereas flare pixels remain continuously bright over a longer period determined by the characteristic cooling times in the flaring atmosphere , applying a condition on the duration of a flare pixel ( criterion  iv ) enables us to strongly reduce the effect of blooming in the identification of flare pixels .    in the event under study",
    "the seeing conditions at kanzelhhe were moderate and the field of the source ar was very strong .",
    "thus , seeing effects will impose maximal errors on the resulting reconnection fluxes , as image blurring and consequently deviations from perfect co - alignment may cause significant differences in the photospheric magnetic - flux density co - registered to the flare pixels .",
    "thus , this case allows us to derive an upper estimate on the typical errors of magnetic - reconnection fluxes and peak reconnection rates derived from ground - based data .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the evolution of the flare in aia  1600   , kso h@xmath0 , and ca  ii  k filtergrams . for each wavelength",
    "we show snapshots before the flare , during the rise , the peak , and the decay phase .",
    "an interesting feature that we note in the h@xmath0 pre - flare image in figure  [ f1 ] is that the ribbon structure located in the leading sunspot already appears brighter than the surroundings _ before _ the flare commences .",
    "a similar enhancement ( but less distinct ) also appears for the flare kernels located in the trailing sunspot ( compare the h@xmath0 images in the first and the fourth row in figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows a sequence of images recorded in the aia  94   filter before and during the flare .",

    "one can clearly see that the flare occurs in the core of the ar . the positive polarity ribbon ( indicated by blue color )",
    "is partially located in the umbra of the leading sunspot but the larger fraction is located in surrounding plage regions , whereas the negative polarity ribbon ( red color ) is fully located in the trailing sunspot , mostly in its penumbra but partially also in the umbra .",

    "the bottom panel shows for comparison the goes 18   soft x - ray ( sxr ) flux and its time derivative .",
    "the sxr emission reflects the cumulative effect of plasma heating and chromospheric evaporation due to flare - accelerated electrons and thermal conduction from the hot flaring corona .",

    "_ figure  [ f4 ] ) but the mean field strength in the flare pixels in the negative polarity is larger than in the positive polarity .",
    "this results in total magnetic - reconnection fluxes that are roughly balanced .",

    "there is a general trend that in the ground - based data the derived areas are larger and the mean magnetic - field strengths in the flare pixels lower .",
    "however , the overall evolution of the derived @xmath41 and @xmath46 curves is similar to the ones derived from aia  1600   .",
    "the larger areas obtained in the h@xmath0 and ca  ii  k data can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution and in particular to seeing effects resulting in image blurring and jitter ( _ cf . _ the accompanying movies number  3 and 4 ) . due to these random distortions in the ground - based images ,",

    "the total reconnection flux determined from aia is @xmath55  mx .",
    "we note that this corresponds to about 2% of the total unsigned magnetic flux contained in the source ar  12192 at its maximum , determined to be @xmath56  mx on 27 october 2015 @xcite . *",
    "the total reconnected flare flux determined by the ground - based observations may be overestimated by up to a factor of two , which results from seeing influences combined with lower spatial resolution . since in the event under study",
    "the seeing conditions at kso were moderate and the field in the source ar very strong , this factor of two can be interpreted as an upper limit on typical errors due to seeing conditions .",
    "we note that this factor is in agreement with the range obtained in @xcite , who applied artificial misalignment between the data source of the flare ribbons and the co - registered magnetograms to estimate the errors on the magnetic - reconnection flux calculations .",
    "* for all three data sets , the total positive and negative flare reconnection magnetic fluxes are balanced within @xmath5720% , indicating that  as expected  equal amounts of both polarities take part in the magnetic - reconnection process .",
    "this flux ratio lies well within the range of 0.5 to 2 obtained for 13 eruptive c , m , and x - class flares by @xcite . *",
    "combining the results of previous studies on magnetic - reconnection rates for eruptive flares yields a relation between the logarithm of the flare reconnection flux and the goes flare class with a correlation coefficient of @xmath58 ( figure  [ f10 ] ) .",
    "there seems to exist an upper boundary to this relation , whereas the lower boundary seems less defined . from this upper boundary",
    "one can deduce that a reconnected magnetic flux of about @xmath59  mx results in a flare of goes class x10 or larger . *",
    "the confined x1.6 flare under study lies well within the distribution of reconnection flux against goes class , _",
    "i.e. _ there seems to be no characteristic difference to the sample of eruptive flares .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , the correlation between the flare magnetic - reconnection flux and the goes class is distinctly higher when the ( few ) extreme events are included . removing the x17 and x10 flares of 28 and 29 october 2003",
    ", the correlation coefficient in figure  [ f10 ] reduces from @xmath58 to @xmath60 .",
    "since the scatter in this plot is quite substantial , further studies including a statistical set of confined flares distributed over the flare classes are necessary to reach at a definitive conclusion whether there are distinct differences in the magnetic - reconnection fluxes between the two types of events . such difference is , _",
    "e.g. _ , expected as in the eruptive flares part of the energy that is converted in the magnetic - reconnection process goes into acceleration and escape of the cme , whereas in the confined flares all of the magnetic energy released is available for the flare .",
    "statistically , the cme kinetic energy is a larger contribution than the energy in the associated flare @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that _ how _ magnetic reconnection in the confined x - class flare under study does take place is not at all clear . in the confined c - class flare studied by @xcite",
    "it was clearly observed that two systems of oppositely directed ( `` cool '' ) coronal loops re - connected , resulting in two sets of newly formed hot loops : one smaller loop system retracting downward from the reconnection site and a larger overlying loop system relaxing upwards due to the magnetic - tension force .",
    "however , in the x1.6 flare under study , there are no obvious changes of the magnetic - field topology observed in the euv imagery .",
    "however , we note that the ribbon structures already appeared bright in the h@xmath0 filtergrams _ before _ the flare started , suggesting that the magnetic connectivity causing this enhanced chromospheric emission is also involved in the flaring process ( _ cf . _  fig  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this is also supported by the aia  94   images showing a set of hot loops connecting the location of the two flare ribbons _ before _ the flare actually commenced , and then brighten up _ during _ the flare ( compare in particular panels a and g in figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "these findings are in line with the early observations of @xcite that in confined flares pre - existing loops , _ i.e. _ already existing magnetic structures , seem to brighten up and evolve into flaring loops .    one scenario resulting in such observations would be reconnection of localized newly emerging flux tubes with pre - existing large coronal loops ( _ cf .",
    "_ emerging flux model of solar flares by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the small new loops that are formed by the reconnection process would be unresolved and the set of large loops formed would closely resemble the pre - flare loop system observed .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the large initial ribbon separation and the lack of separation motion that seem to be a typical feature of confined m- and x - class flares ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we note that in the source active region of the confined x1.6 flare under study there is no sign of a filament indicating the presence of a flux rope that might become unstable by such magnetic reconfiguration initiating an eruption ( or failed eruption ) .",
