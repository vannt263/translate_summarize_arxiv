    "the origin of the present acceleration of the universe has been one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology .",
    "to explain this acceleration , one can assume a mysterious component called dark energy @xcite or , also resort to the modification of gravity @xcite .",
    "recently there have been attempts to describe these models using the effective field theory @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation such as late - time quantum backreaction from inflationary fluctuations has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "a lot of efforts have also been made to elucidate the nature of dark energy by using cosmological observations .",
    "when one investigates the nature of dark energy using observational data , a phenomenological approach is often taken , in which the properties of dark energy , particularly , its equation of state ( eos ) is parametrized in a general way . since the eos depends on time in most models of dark energy , its time evolution",
    "is usually accommodated when parametrizing it and constraints on such eos parameters have been analyzed by using actual cosmological data ( see @xcite for the constraint from the measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of planck in combination with baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , type ia supernovae ( sne ) and @xmath9 measurements for some parametrization , and @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "although observational constraints on dark energy parameters are becoming more and more severe , we are still far from pinning down the model which describes the present - day cosmic acceleration .",
    "however because the accuracy of cosmological observations will be much improved in future , the nature of dark energy can be probed more accurately .",
    "therefore it would be worth investigating how precisely we can obtain the information on dark energy parameters in future cosmological observations .    as such , we in this paper focus on observations of fluctuations of 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "observations of 21 cm line can probe different redshift epochs compared with other methods .",
    "therefore we can obtain unique information which can not be acquired by other observations .",
    "in addition , the next generation of the 21 cm survey , square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite , will be in operation in 2020s .",
    "hence it is timely to study expected constraints on dark energy by using 21 cm experiments .",
    "there have been several works on dark energy using future observational data of 21 cm intensity mapping @xcite , hi galaxy survey @xcite and 21 cm fluctuations @xcite . in this paper , we use the 21 cm fluctuations to derive projected constraints on various dark energy models from ska in combination with future cmb experiments such as core+ @xcite and future observations of sne , bao and a direct measurement of hubble constant @xmath9 , assuming several types of dark energy parametrizations . as mentioned above , because the 21 cm observations can probe the different epochs of the dark energy evolution compared to other observations , it should be complementary to those of others .",
    "in addition to ska , we also consider the next - next generation of the 21 cm experiment such as omniscope @xcite , which is expected to give an unprecedented accuracy . by making an analysis adopting the above mentioned observations ,",
    "we discuss how the 21 cm observation can probe the nature of dark energy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize how to parametrize dark energy eos , which is used in this paper . then in section",
    "[ sec : current_const ] , we present current constraints on dark energy parameters introduced in section  [ sec : de_param ] . then in section",
    "[ sec : future_const ] , we investigate expected constraints on dark energy from future observations of 21 cm line in combination with other observations such as cmb , bao , sneia and @xmath9 .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion of this paper .",
    "in this section , we summarize parametrizations for dark energy equations of state @xmath10 which are used in our analysis . in most models of dark energy ,",
    "its eos depends on time .",
    "however , the time variation of @xmath10 is highly model - dependent , and thus it is customary to assume some parametrization for @xmath10 to take the time - dependence into account .",
    "although there have been proposed a lot of possible parametrizations , we adopt some representative ones in this paper . for some other parametrizations ,",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite , in which various dark energy parametrizations are discussed .",
    "@xmath11 * parametrization i *    one of simple ways to parametrize the time - varying @xmath10 is to assume that @xmath10 varies linearly with the scale factor , which can be given by the following form @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the scale factor and redshift changes linearly with the redshift has also been adopted in some literature  @xcite . however , here we do not consider such a parametrization . ] .",
    "@xmath15 represents the eos at present while @xmath16 is its value at far past . with this parametrization",
    ", the energy density of dark energy can be given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] with @xmath18 being the dark energy density at present .",
    "@xmath11 * parametrization ii *    in some models of dark energy , its eos suddenly changes from some constant value to another .",
    "this kind of changes can not be accommodated in the above parametrization .",
    "the authors of @xcite have introduced a parametrization which can represent this kind of sudden change of @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) corresponds to the scale factor ( redshift ) at which @xmath10 changes suddenly from @xmath23 to @xmath15 . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath24 controls the width of the transition .",
    "the time evolution of the dark energy density in this parametrization is calculated as @xmath25    @xmath11 * parametrization iii *    a commonly assumed dark energy evolves in such a way that its energy density begins to dominate only at a late epoch of the universe , and it is subdominant at an earlier time . however , in some models such as tracker quintessence model in which its eos traces that of the dominant component in the universe ( i.e. , radiation or matter ) .",
    "such a model is sometimes called `` early dark energy '' since its energy density contributes to the total one to some extent . to represent this kind of models , the following parametrization has been proposed @xcite : @xmath26 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 corresponds to the present - day equation of state . to avoid too large value ( or divergence ) of @xmath10 at earlier times , @xmath27 should be positive . then , when @xmath28 is large , @xmath10 approaches to 0 , which is the same as that of matter .",
    "therefore , this kind of dark energy can give some contribution at earlier times ( in matter - dominated epoch ) .",
    "the energy density of dark energy of this parametrization can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    "before investigating the future expected constraints on dark energy parameters , here we study constraints from current observations such as planck , bao , sneia , @xmath9 and weak lensing for each parametrization .",
    "although similar analyses have been done in the literature for some parametrizations , we update those constraints , and by doing those analyses , we can choose fiducial values for the eos parameters consistent with current observational data in the next section .",
    "we have performed markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses by using a modified version of cosmomc @xcite , in which we have accommodated the dark energy parametrizations introduced in section  [ sec : de_param ] . for the sound speed @xmath31 which needs to be specified when solving the perturbation equations , we fixed it as @xmath32 in the analysis of this section .",
    "in addition to the dark energy parameters , we have also varied the standard cosmological parameters : baryon density @xmath33 , dark matter density @xmath34 , the amplitude and the spectral index of the scalar mode primordial power spectrum @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the reionization optical depth @xmath37 and the acoustic peak scale @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the normalized hubble parameter defined as @xmath40 .",
    "in deriving constraints from current data , we adopt two different data sets .",
    "the first one is `` planck+bao+lensing '' which includes the power spectra of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies ( tt+te+ee at @xmath41 and tt+te+ee+bb at @xmath42 ) from planck  @xcite , bao scales in galaxy power spectrum  @xcite and the planck cmb lens power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the other data set we adopt in this analysis is `` planck+bao+lensing+@xmath9+sn+wl '' in which data from measurements of hubble constant @xmath43  km / s / mpc  @xcite , the jla compilation of type ia supernovae  @xcite and the chftlens cosmic shear power spectrum  @xcite are added to `` planck+bao+lensing . ''    in figs .",

    "i , we have assumed the prior for the eos parameters @xmath15 and @xmath23 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the constraint on this parametrization has been investigated in @xcite , using almost the same ( but slightly different ) data sets .",
    "our result is consistent with the one obtained in @xcite . for the parametrization  ii ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath21 and @xmath24 and show the constraints on the @xmath15@xmath23 plane . in fig .",

    ". therefore we show the constraint on the @xmath15@xmath27 plane for this parametrization .",

    "yet another parametrization of early dark energy has also been discussed in @xcite by using planck 2013 data .",
    "having obtained the current constraints on the parameters for eos , we choose fiducial values of the eos parameters , which are allowed within at 2@xmath48 level , in order to perform the fisher matrix analysis in the next section .",

    "in addition , we combine future observations of sne , bao and direct hubble constant measurement to obtain the expected constraints . the specifications of observations we adopt in this paper are summarized in appendix  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "since the method of the analysis for the 21 cm fluctuations and cmb adopted in this paper is the same as the one in our previous paper @xcite , we do not give the detail of those here ( we refer the readers to @xcite for the detailed description of the method ) .",
    "however , since the publication of @xcite , the specification of ska has been changed .",
    "hence we adopt the new specification and summarize it in table  [ tab : ska_spec ] in appendix  [ sec : spec ] . for cmb , although the specification of core+ is discussed in @xcite , it is the one only for the planning stage .",

    "@xcite , which is the original specification of core .",
    "although the specification adopted in this work would be a little bit different from the one assumed in @xcite , it does not change our results at all .",
    "we tabulate its specification in table  [ tab : core_spec ] . for planck",
    ", we assume the same specification as that in @xcite .",
    "regarding the analysis of future observations of sne , bao and the direct hubble constant measurement , we describe our methods in the following subsections , then present our results on the expected constraints on dark energy parameters for each parametrization in order .",

    "one finds that they are almost the same regardless of the value of @xmath31 , which indicates that the effects of varying @xmath31 is very weak , and its assumption scarcely affects the constraints .",
    "this also indicates that the nature of dark energy perturbation can not be well probed by cmb nor 21 cm fluctuations , at least for dark energy models with this parametrization , and the constraints mainly comes from its effects on the background evolution .    in fig .",

    "we should stress that the tendency depends on the parametrization as we discuss in the following sections .",
    "however , for the parametrization i , although the 21 cm observations look at different redshift range from cmb and other observations , and can probe multiple redshift slices , we need a better specification at the level of omniscope to obtain a severe constraint on dark energy parameters .",

    "first let us discuss the case of @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath24 is so large , the eos abruptly changes at the corresponding scale factor @xmath21 ( or the redshift @xmath22 ) . in the case of @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hm_w0w1_p100 ] , the eos is almost unchanged after @xmath116 . since bao and sne only probe low redshift @xmath117",

    "that is why @xmath23 can not be determined for the case with the fiducial value of @xmath114 with cmb+bao+sne+@xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted here that cmb is not so powerful to constrain the eos compared to bao and sne since integrated quantities such as the angular diameter distance to last scattering surface are the main probes .",
    "however cmb is very important to determine the other cosmological parameters which can break some degeneracies among the parameters including the dark energy eos .",
    "also , for the case with @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) , the data set of cmb+bao+sne+@xmath9 can not well determine @xmath23 .",
    "in these cases however , when we add information of 21 cm fluctuations which probes the redshift @xmath120 , @xmath23 can be severely constrained .",
    "this shows the power of the 21 cm observations to investigate dark energy . in the case of @xmath121 , the eos changes from @xmath23 to @xmath15 at @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , by the observations of bao and sne , we can constrain both of @xmath15 and @xmath23 . however even in this case , when we include ska2 , the constraint on @xmath23 slightly improves . when omniscope is included , the constraint becomes more severe .",
    "next let us consider the case of @xmath110 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hm_w0w1_p1 ]",

    "hence even when the transition redshift is higher than @xmath123 , @xmath23 can be constrained severely by low - redshift observations like bao and sne .",
    "a slow change of the eos also indicates that both of @xmath15 and @xmath23 can be well probed at higher redshift , irrespective of the transition redshift @xmath22 .",
