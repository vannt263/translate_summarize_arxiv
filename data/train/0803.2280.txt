    "hypernovae ( hne ) are a peculiar type of supernova with ejecta velocities and apparent isotropic - equivalent ejecta energies which are larger than usual , and with indications of anisotropy ( nomoto , et al , 2008 ) .",
    "some of them are associated with long gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. woosley and bloom , 2006 ; a recent example being grb060218/sn2006aj , e.g. campana et al , 2006 ) , while others appear not to be .",
    "cosmic rays up to energies @xmath3 ev are thought to be accelerated in relatively normal supernova remnants ( hillas , 2005 ) .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that hne may accelerate cosmic ray protons or nuclei up to energies @xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "the smoking gun proof for cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants would be the observation of very high energy ( @xmath5 tev ) neutrinos ( e.g. kistler and beacom , 2006 ) , which will require completion of cubic kilometer detectors , or else the observation of secondary photons arising from pions , which remains inconclusive ( e.g. gabici and aharonian , 2007 ; katz and waxman , 2008 ; etc . ) .",
    "nonetheless , continued gamma - ray observation with air cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) in the tev range , and with glast and agile in the gev range may provide the best immediate hopes for resolving this question . in the present paper , we consider the same question in relation to hne , and address the question of the photons signatures from secondaries arising from cosmic ray acceleration in typical hne .    in  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we describe our model nhs and consider the baryonic and photonic environment in which the explosion occurs , as well as its effect on the cosmic rays accelerated in the ejecta . in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the monte carlo simulations performed on these models , and present the results for the photon signatures arising from various secondary components . in  [ sec : disc ] we discuss the detectability prospects for these signals , compared to the sensitivity of acts and glast , and summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "hne , especially the ic types associated with grb but also some of the unassociated ones , are thought to be due to wr progenitors ( nomoto et al , 2006 ) , and as such are expected to have had a strong stellar wind phase prior to the explosion .",
    "the model of a hn ejecta expanding in a stellar wind used in this paper is based on the model of @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a stellar wind environment around the progenitor which is characteristic of wr stars . assuming a mass loss rate @xmath6 and a wind velocity @xmath7 , the density profile of the wind is written as @xmath8 g @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the outer envelope regions ( the ejecta ) of the exploding hn , as shown by @xcite , have a kinetic energy distribution @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath16 erg , where the velocity of the bulk of the ejecta ranges from @xmath17 up to semi - relativistic values ( @xmath18 ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ejecta normalized velocity and bulk lorentz factor , respectively .    for non - relativistic ejecta ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 erg ) , the free expansion phase before deceleration sets in lasts for @xmath23 days .",
    "therefore , non - relativistic ejecta can not dissipate their kinetic energy within the 10 - 20 days typical timescale of the uv - optical photon radiation from hne .",
    "thus after the optical emission from hne has declined , we may not expect secondary photons originating from @xmath24-interactions , even if a sufficient amount of high - energy protons are produced .",
    "on the other hand , the bulk of the kinetic energy of the mildly relativistic ejecta are dissipated at a radius @xmath25 cm . since @xmath26 for such ejecta , all the mildly relativistic ejecta dissipate their kinetic energy within 10 days , as long as @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , hereafter we consider only the most energetic component @xmath28 ( @xmath29 erg ) of the mildly relativistic ejecta .    for the ejecta with @xmath28 , the magnetic field at the dissipation radius @xmath30",
    "may be estimated as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fraction of the equipartition value of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath33 g.    the maximum energy of accelerated protons for the mildly relativistic ejecta may be written as @xmath34 . with the above values of @xmath35 and @xmath30",
    ", we obtain @xmath36 ev , for the most energetic ejecta dissipated within 10 days . adopting this value ,",
    "the energy distribution of accelerated protons is assumed to be @xmath37 .",
    "the amount of protons is normalized by an efficiency factor @xmath38 for the conversion of dissipated kinetic energy ( @xmath39 erg ) into energy of accelerated protons @xcite .",
    "the usually observed low energy ( @xmath40 ev ) photons from hne are attributed largely to radioactive decay in the non - relativistic ( @xmath41 ) ejecta .",
    "after an initial rise and just after the dissipation of the ejecta ( @xmath42 a few days ) , the changes in the optical luminosity of the hn are not very drastic ( 1 - 2 magnitudes ) , as shown in @xcite . therefore , a constant luminosity for a few tens of days may be a reasonable approximation . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the peak flux is at 4000 - 5500  , which is considered to be due to broad emission lines of several types of metals .",
    "here we mimic this photon field by a thermal photon field with a temperature @xmath43 ev and luminosity @xmath44 , which is compatible with the bolometric luminosity of sn1998bw around its peak brightness @xcite .",
    "another source of low energy photons is synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated in the ejecta . for mildly relativistic shocks ,",
    "the typical lorentz factor of accelerated electrons is less than @xmath45 , which implies that the typical energy of synchrotron photons is @xmath46 ev for @xmath47 g. the cooling timescale of such electrons is @xmath40 day , which is much shorter than the timescales we consider .",
    "injection of accelerated electrons may continue for a few tens of days as indicated by radio observations .",
    "the most luminous radio afterglow in hne observed ever is in sn 2003dh @xcite of @xmath48 erg @xmath49 , which may slightly enhance pion production efficiency for the highest energy protons ( @xmath50 ev ) . here , for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the photon emission from accelerated electrons .    in order to calculate the pion production and the subsequent cascade processes ,",
    "we carry out monte carlo simulations using a code developed for and discussed in a series of studies of gamma - ray burst physics @xcite .",
    "we use a simple one - zone approximation , and follow during a finite time the physical processes of pion production , pion decay , muon decay , and @xmath51 electron - positron pair creation , as well as the usual radiation processes of synchrotron ( sy ) and inverse compton ( ic ) emission from protons , pions , muons , electrons , and positrons .",
    "we assume that the accelerated protons are injected promptly just after the energy dissipation occurs at @xmath52 .",
    "since the bulk motion of the post - shock region is non - relativistic , we neglect the expansion of the ejecta after that .",
    "first , we consider a hn exploding in a standard wind with @xmath53 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr - a1 ] , even after the accelerated protons have been irradiated by the hn photons for @xmath54 days , most of the protons still retain a large fraction of their energy .",
    "the pion - production timescale @xmath55 is inversely proportional to the hn photon density @xmath56 .",
    "following @xcite , the fraction of the energy lost by protons to pions is estimated as @xmath57 , which is consistent with our numerical result . charged pions of typical energy @xmath58 ev and a total fluence of @xmath59 erg",
    "are produced within this timescale , which give rise to electromagnetic cascades .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] , if one neglects the @xmath51-absorption effects , a spectral bump of sy emission appears around the tev-10 tev energy range .",
    "this bump is due to sy photons of @xmath60 tev from positrons and electrons from muon decay . since the sy photon energy scales as the square of the energy of the emitters , the photon bump energy range spreads over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath61 effects leads to these photons being absorbed through interaction with the hn soft photon field , creating electron - positron pairs of 1 - 10 @xmath62 tev .",
    "the secondary pairs emit sy photons over a wide energy range ( which should be twice as wide as that of the tev bump ) , from a few kev to a few hundreds of kev .",
    "these pairs cool so promptly that the result is a simple power - law spectrum due to cooled pairs below 100 ev .",
    "the secondary photon emission is expected to last as long as the hn emits optical photons , even though the cooling time of the electrons that emit x - ray photons is only about 1 minute .",
    "these photons will be observed with various present - day x - ray telescopes for @xmath63 ks integration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] , unless the x - ray afterglow emission of a grb overwhelms it , e.g. as seen in grb060218/sn2006aj .    around the gev region ,",
    "proton sy emission yields a bump in the photon spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] .",
    "the typical energy of proton sy photons is @xmath64 gev , and the ratio @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 sy cooling timescale ) is @xmath67 , which roughly agrees with the obtained energy fraction of proton sy to pions . for this distance",
    "the fluence is much lower than the glast detection limit .",
    "to detect 100 mev photons with glast would require a hn at @xmath68 mpc .    another notable feature of fig . [ fig : phot - a1 ] , around energies @xmath58 ev , is the prominent presence of photons from @xmath2-decay .",
    "those photons escape without being absorbed by the @xmath42 1 ev thermal photon field assumed for the hn .",
    "however , the mean free path of these @xmath69 ev photons against @xmath51 absorption by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons is @xmath70 kpc @xcite , so that we can not expect to detect such photons directly .",
    "the secondary electron - positron pairs generated by attenuation are very energetic , and are inverse - compton scattered by cmb photons , e.g. as discussed for grbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these boosted photons can pair - produce again , and the process repeats itself until the energy of the degraded photons is in the 1 - 10 tev range . the mean free path of these regenerated 1 - 10 tev photons is longer than 100 mpc , and they can reach the earth . as long as the intergalactic magnetic field is weak enough , the delay time of tev photons emitted by @xmath71 tev electrons / positrons is negligible in comparison with the timescale a few days @xcite .",
    "we omit plotting the spectrum of the regenerated photons in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] , since from @xmath72 mpc it will be hard to detect them ; however , if a hn occurs in the virgo cluster ( @xmath73 mpc ) , there would be a chance to detect these secondary tev photons ( see below ) .    next , we consider a hn occurring in a denser wind with @xmath74 .",
    "this value is compatible with currently available data on wind mass losses suggesting @xmath75 , which refer to stars well before any explosion @xcite .",
    "physically , even larger values may be plausible , since one expects the the mass loss to increase considerably as the evolution of the core rapidly approaches the final collapse , with a rapid increase in the luminosity and the envelope expansion rate .",
    "in this case of @xmath74 , the ejecta will stall at @xmath76 cm within @xmath40 day , so that the non - relativistic ejecta of @xmath77 can catch up with the decelerating ejecta about 10 days later .",
    "however , at least until the non - relativistic ejecta has caught up , the secondary photons are largely observable .    basically , the cooling time - scale is shorter than the integration time scale ( @xmath78 days ) assumed here , which results in a bumpy non - power law energy distribution of the final protons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cr - a5 ] ) .",
    "the highest energy protons cool via sy ( @xmath79 ) , while protons of @xmath80 ev cool via photomeson production ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "if we take into account the radio emission from accelerated electrons , these complex feature of the proton spectrum may be weakened because of the high efficiency of pion production above @xmath82 ev .    in this case",
    "the proton sy emission becomes prominent , since the cooling timescale @xmath83 is shorter .",
    "the secondary photon flux ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phot - a5 ] ) is , as expected , larger than in the lower density wind ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] ) case .",
    "however , even this higher density wind case gives , from d=100 mpc , an insufficient flux to be detectable with glast ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a5 ] ) .",
    "however , photons from similar hne within 40 mpc would be detectable by glast .",
    "in addition , the regenerated tev photons are promising targets of acts . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a5 ] we plot the regenerated photon spectrum obtained by the same numerical simulation as in @xcite .",
    "they are well above the detection limit of present - day acts even for @xmath72 mpc .",
    "secondary x - ray photons are emitted by electron - positron pairs originating from photons due to both proton sy and sy photons from muon - decay positrons .",
    "this is because the energy of the proton sy photons shifts higher @xmath84 .",
    "since the energy range of the absorbed proton sy photons ( @xmath85 ev ) is narrow , the secondary pairs produce a characteristic peak in the fluence spectrum around @xmath86 kev .",
    "these photons are indirect evidence of proton sy , and can be easily detected with present - day instruments .",
    "we have shown that secondary gamma and x - rays , correlated with the initial thermal optical emission of hypernovae in the first @xmath70 days , can provide evidence for proton acceleration , as well as provide a diagnostic for amplification of magnetic field in the blast wave , and for the mass loss rate in the progenitor stellar wind prior to the explosion .",
    "there are three main spectral components of secondary photons : 1 ) x - ray photons emitted by electron - positron pairs originating from @xmath51 interactions initiated by synchrotron photons from muon - decay positrons or protons , 2 ) synchrotron photons emitted by protons in the gev band , and 3 ) regenerated tev photons emitted by electron - positron pairs generated by cmb attenuation of @xmath2 decay photons around @xmath69 ev .",
    "the x - ray photons are the most promising targets , so that follow - up observations of hne with x - ray telescopes are indispensable to find evidence of proton acceleration .",
    "soft sy photons from accelerated electrons may also enhance the electromagnetic cascades by interacting with photons from pion - decay .",
    "the interesting @xmath2-decay photon signature ( component 3 ) is also an interesting candidate for detection with acts in the dense wind case ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "if a hn occurs in our galaxy at a distance of 10 kpc ( the rate for which should be @xmath88 yr@xmath89 ) , our results indicate an expected flux @xmath90-@xmath91 erg @xmath92 @xmath49 at @xmath93 gev for @xmath94-@xmath95 , due to proton sy and/or secondary leptons , detectable by glast . by comparison ,",
    "the most luminous  normal \" snrs observed with egret @xcite have fluxes of @xmath96 erg @xmath92 @xmath49 at 10 gev .",
    "tev photon detections are not expected to be detectable from a galactic hn , since the photon regeneration process mean free path is too long to be effective here .",
    "our simulations show also that the secondary @xmath5 tev neutrinos from the cascades in a galactic hn have a spectral peak at @xmath69 ev with a flux of @xmath97-@xmath98 erg @xmath92 , well above the detection limit of icecube .",
    "thus , one would expect to detect continuous tev neutrino emission for a few days from such galactic hne .",
    "for hne at distances @xmath99 mpc , the x - rays ( component 1 ) will be easily detectable by xmm , the sub - tev radiation is marginally detectable near the low energy threshold by magic and similar acts , and the gev photons from a proton sy ( component 2 ) are difficult to detect with glast .",
    "however , for @xmath87 , hne in the virgo cluster ( @xmath73 mpc ) would be easily detectable at gev energies by glast , as would also the regenerated tev photons",
    ". such detections would provide constraints on hn models .",
    "e.g. the duration of the proton sy emission or the x - ray spectral peak at 1 kev gives an estimate of the survival timescale of magnetic fields amplified by the non - linear mhd turbulance excited by cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "since the maximum proton energy is not so sensitive to @xmath100 , the spectral component 1 due to the cascades from pion production will not change drastically , even for @xmath101 , although the direct proton sy ( component 2 ) can become negligible .",
    "in such cases , the disappearance of the x - ray spectral peak shown in the @xmath87 case would be a diagnostic for such low @xmath100 values .",
    "the intensity of the cascades depends on the wind density , providing a diagnostic for the progenitor mass loss rate .",
    "for example , with @xmath102 and other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a1 ] the fluxes are undetectable even by x - ray instruments , unless the source is extremely near . on the other hand ,",
    "larger values of @xmath103 10 ( e.g. as suggested by campana et al ( 2006 ) for sn2006aj ) would give higher fluxes than those of fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - a5 ] , enhancing the probability of detection at @xmath104 mpc at tev , gev , and x - ray energies .",
