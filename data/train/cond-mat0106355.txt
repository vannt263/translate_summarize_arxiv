    "the use of migdal  eliashberg ( me ) theory for the study and analysis of electron - phonon systems is widespread . for conventional superconductors such as lead , where the electron - phonon coupling is higher than can be treated with bcs theory ,",
    "me theory has been extremely successful for understanding the superconducting properties .",
    "recently , a lot of researchers have been interested in an apparent kink in the electronic dispersion of cuprate supercondutors as determined from angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and their analysis / interpretation typically uses the related engelsberg  schrieffer ( es ) result ( i.e. just the lowest order fock diagram ) @xcite .",
    "the es result divides excitations into long - lived ( coherent ) low - energy excitations , and rapidly decaying high - energy excitations , with a kink at the phonon energy .",
    "es based analysis of arpes results suggests a large electron - phonon coupling in the cuprates , with estimates of the dimensionless coupling constant lying between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( depending on doping ) and very large phonon frequencies of @xmath2 mev @xcite . there has also been a development of a maximum entropy technique for analysing cuprate superconductors which makes use of eliashberg theory @xcite . the analysis in ref . determines a dimensionless electron - phonon coupling of @xmath3 , but this is well above the @xmath4 value where one would normally expect perturbation theory to fail .",

    ", a full re - analysis of the perturbation theory is of high significance .",
    "the neglect of vertex corrections suggested by migdal leads to a theory where an infinite set of feynman diagrams may be summed . according to an analysis carried out by migdal",
    ", this theory should be valid in the physical regime of electron - phonon problems , where the phonon energy is significantly smaller than the intersite hopping ( `` migdal s theorem '' ) @xcite specifically that the vertex corrections are small when @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the phonon frequency and @xmath7 the fermi energy ) .",
    "on the basis of migdal s analysis , it is often believed that migdal  eliashberg theory is applicable above @xmath4 in the adiabatic limit because of the apparently small size of the vertex corrections , even though in general perturbative approaches break down ( i.e. the functional form of the self - energy becomes incorrect ) when the coupling constant becomes large . in this article , we revisit migdal s analysis by examining the large-@xmath8 limit ( local approximation ) .",
    "the large-@xmath8 limit has been an effective workshop for determining the validity of approximate schemes .",
    "the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) solution in the large-@xmath8 limit @xcite has been compared with a number of different diagrammatic approaches @xcite demonstrating that self - consistent second - order perturbation theory worked better than migdal - eliashberg theory at intermediate phonon frequencies and strong coupling ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",

    "is justified , and the formalism should be exact . such propagation of correlation is also small when the coordination number is high ( e.g. fcc lattices ) .",

    "the spectral functions show two features .",
    "there is a low energy peak with a width defined by the phonon frequency , and a high energy shoulder .",
    "this behaviour can be related to the two limits of the holstein model . at low energy scales ( @xmath74 ) , electrons interact via virtual processes and the behaviour is essentially hubbard - like ( correlated ) . at frequencies greater than @xmath75 , the spectral weight is reduced , phonons may be created , and static behaviour emerges ( in the static limit , phonons may always be created as no energy is required to deform the lattice ) .",
    "the central peak narrows with increased coupling , until a critical value is reached . here",
    ", the theory has a brinkman  rice - like transition with a diverging effective mass @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : selfenergy ] , we plot the imaginary part of the self - energy . for low coupling strengths ( small @xmath30 and energy scales ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 $ ]",
    "is small because electrons can not create phonons , consistent with the englesberg ",
    "schrieffer analysis ) .",
    "however , as the coupling increases , electrons can be scattered by bipolaron resonances and @xmath78 $ ] rises sharply on either side of the fermi - energy .",
    "the gap in the weight of the self - energy is frequently assumed in the analysis of arpes data , but as we can see here , when the electron - phonon coupling approaches the band width ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , the self - energy has a more complicated form , without the simple picture of coherent and incoherent quasi - particles .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated that in low dimensions , vertex corrections are required to achieve a sharp discrimination between coherent and incoherent dressed electrons @xcite .",
    "the onset of this `` transition '' can be studied by examining the inverse quasi - particle mass ( quasi - particle weight ) , shown in figure [ fig : qpweight ] for two values of phonon frequency .",
    "as the coupling increases , @xmath79 becomes smaller and eventually vanishes at a critical value of coupling ( the effective mass diverges ) .",
    "we also examine the phonon spectral function in figure [ fig : phonspec ] for @xmath80 and various couplings . as the coupling",
    "is increased , the phonon modes soften ( figure [ fig : phonfreq ] ) .",
    "the effective frequency does not tend to zero as quickly as the quasi - particle weight .",
    "we will revisit this point later in this article .",
    "it is clearly the case that me theory does not correctly describe the strong coupling limit .",
    "it is known from the exact solution of the static limit @xcite and from approximate `` iterated - perturbation theory '' @xcite and qmc @xcite solutions of the hubbard model , that sub - bands should form at strong coupling .",
    "as our calculations demonstrate , this sub - band formation is not properly reproduced within me theory and this makes it likely that effects of vertex corrections become significantly more important at strong coupling .",
    "since this is at variance with the traditional interpretation of migdal s analysis , we are motivated to re - examine the vertex function in the next section .",
    "the neglect of the lowest - order vertex correction shown in figure [ fig : feynmandiag](c ) and all higher - order corrections is central to migdal  eliashberg theory . in this section ,",
    "we compute the lowest - order correction and use this to define the region of validity for me theory . in this sense , we are revisiting migdal s analysis to understand why there is a contradiction between low frequency results computed with me theory and advanced numerical methods .",
    "the ratio of first to zeroth order vertices at finite temperature may be written as @xmath81    as temperature tends to zero , this sum becomes an integral which may easily be evaluated ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined as in figure [ fig : feynmandiag ] ) , @xmath84 in order for vertex corrections to be unimportant , the ratio @xmath85 must be small . as an example",
    ", we show the lowest order correction to the vertex function for ( a ) @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( b ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 in figure [ fig : vertexcorrection ] . for the larger phonon frequencies , the ratio is clearly greater than 10% and the approximation is expected to be significantly changed by the inclusion of vertex corrections . for the weak coupling @xmath30 shown here , the corrections are much less pronounced for small phonon frequencies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : diverge ] we show the magnitude of the central peak of the vertex correction ( always the largest part of the function ) for a range of couplings at @xmath90 . between @xmath91 and @xmath92 the vertex correction diverges , and me theory clearly breaks down . as it is necessary to pass through the divergence to reach @xmath93 ,",
    "the theory is not applicable for strong couplings .",
    "figure [ fig : breakdown ] shows the lowest value of @xmath94 for given @xmath95 at which the ratio @xmath96 exceeds 0.1 ( the primed quantities are chosen so that @xmath97 represents an unprimed value @xmath98 , and a primed value of @xmath99 represents an unprimed value @xmath100 ) . below this value",
    "me theory can be expected to give accurate results , while the theory begins to break down above this line . for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 )",
    "the standard migdal criterion works well and correctly predicts the region in which me theory is applicable .",
    "however for frequencies @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , the migdal criterion misses the divergence in the vertex correction associated with the divergence in the effective mass",
    ". this breakdown happens at @xmath105 or @xmath4 .",
    "the line of breakdown due to this vertex divergence levels off as the phonon frequency approaches zero and does not scale as @xmath106 ( migdal s criterion ) .",
    "these results imply that there is a breakdown in me theory in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we note that at high phonon frequencies ( @xmath107 ) , our line does not tend to zero .",
    "this is because the contribution @xmath108 does not tend to infinity . instead , the function gets wider as the phonon frequency increases ( see figure [ fig : vertexcorrection ] , panel b ) , and some combination of the magnitude and width of the vertex is probably a better measure of the importance of vertex corrections . at large @xmath6 ,",
    "the breakdown is quite different to that at low phonon frequencies as the second order diagrams ( one of which contains a vertex correction ) develop the same functional form and magnitude .",
    "however the breakdown at @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is not too bad an estimate . at this value of @xmath30 , there is only a small mass renormalisation due to vertex corrections",
    ".    our results are consistent with that of benedetti and zeyher @xcite , which was obtained with a different technique using a semi - circular density of states ( @xmath111 ) , and predicted breakdown for @xmath112 in the extreme adiabatic limit .",
    "we have included their result in the figure , choosing the bandwidth parameter by matching the bare dos at the fermi energy for the two cases ( the conversion factor is @xmath113 ) which is reasonable when considering low energy excitations at half - filling , and corresponds to a critical @xmath114 for the gaussian dos used here ( see the diamond in figure [ fig : breakdown ] ) .",
    "@xcite also predicted a breakdown in me theory at @xmath105 from their solution of the static limit of the infinite - dimensional holstein model , consistent with the breakdown that we have found .",
    "the solution of the static limit predicts the formation of sub - bands , which is something not reproduced in the me solution .",
    "the lack of subbands in me theory demonstrates that higher order diagrams are essential for the description of the sub - band formation , and therefore for the description of the strong coupling limit .",
    "we suggest that the breakdown of me theory should be understood in the following heuristic manner . as the coupling increases , the host spectral function ( @xmath115 ) narrows and",
    "spectral weight is shifted towards lower energy scales .",
    "there is then an effective bandwidth , @xmath116 , for quasi - particles close to the fermi surface .",
    "the condition for the applicability of me theory then becomes @xmath117 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : phonspec ] , there is also a reduction in the effective phonon frequency with increasing interaction strength .",
    "although the renormalisation of the phonon frequency helps to drive against the transition , we note that the band narrowing effect is much stronger , as can be seen by comparing figures [ fig : qpweight ] and [ fig : phonfreq ] .",
    "using the finite temperature form of the self - energy , it is possible to calculate resistivity curves .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : resistivityudep ] at various electron - phonon coupling and phonon frequency . at high temperatures ,",
    "the tendency is to linear behavior , with a gradient depending on @xmath30 , but independent of @xmath118 .",
    "the effect of phonon frequency is most dramatically seen at @xmath119 , where a point of inflection is seen , before the curve tends to low temperature @xmath120 behavior , consistent with a weakly renormalized electron gas .",
    "we note that long range order has not been considered in this study , so no superconducting transition is seen .",
    "the negative curvature of the resistivity curve at intermediate temperatures is of interest , since that curvature has recently been interpreted as an onset of the mott limit , but may have a different interpretation as an intermediate coupling phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we have computed spectral functions , resistivity curves , self - energies , quasi - particle weight and effective phonon frequency for the holstein model at half - filling using migdal  eliashberg theory , within the dmft framework , and revisited migdal s analysis of the strength of the vertex correction . by analysing the first order vertex correction ,",
    "we have defined the region of applicability of me theory .",
    "we find that me theory breaks down at intermediate coupling in the adiabatic limit , showing that migdal ",
    "eliashberg theory should only be trusted at weak coupling within this framework .",
    "the coupling at which breakdown occurs corresponds to a divergence in the effective mass , indicating that both long range order and vertex corrections should be included to correctly describe the strong coupling regime .",
    "the question remains : what was lacking from the analysis of migdal , which estimated the magnitude of the vertex corrections .",
    "this can be understood from the magnitude of the kinetic energy . in the calculations ,",
    "the kinetic energy can be seen to be decreasing due to the localisation at the non - analyticities .",
    "thus in migdal s estimate , the renormalised kinetic energy , and not the bare kinetic energy should have featured .",
    "the renormalised phonon frequency should also have been used , but it tends to zero more slowly than the kinetic energy . at the non - analyticity , where the kinetic energy tends to zero , it can be seen that a vertex divergence is expected from the modified version of migdal s estimate .",
    "our results are timely because of a recent upsurge of interest in the role of electron - phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "there are many experimental results which have been analysed and interpreted using es / me theory , in spite of the large coupling constant that has been predicted from that analysis .",
    "many groups are using migdal s analysis to justify their claims , without a careful consideration of the self - consistent effect of coupling on the kinetic energy of the electrons ( polarons ) .",
    "exact numerical analysis shows that large electron - phonon couplings significantly reduce the kinetic energy of electrons @xcite and thus affect the internal consistency of migdal s analysis .",
    "therefore , the any very large @xmath121 determined from es style analysis of experimental results is not consistent with a theory that neglects vertex corrections ( i.e. a more detailed analysis with higher order effects included is necessary ) . without that analysis ,",
    "the only conclusion that can be reached is that the coupling is large , but no reliable value for that coupling can be determined .",
    "the main conclusion of a breakdown is not expected to change in 1d , 2d or 3d . in three dimensional systems , the role of spatial fluctuations should only be significant very close to the bi - polaron instability .",
    "the role of spatial fluctuations on the spectral properties in 2d has been analysed at weak coupling , and is found to lead to quantitative differences in the coherent excitations @xcite .",
    "spatial fluctuations have a major role in the superconducting state , and it has also been shown that the eliashberg approach to superconductivity is inadequate for optical phonon mediated @xmath8-wave superconductivity @xcite , and incomplete for @xmath122-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
