    "this review of old data covers some neglected physics in the interpretation of low frequency reflection and transmission of weak inductive fields in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "historically these experimental effects are not new and have been detected and reported as anomalously large permeability measurements of ferromagnetic material by a time dependent technique introduced by h. rowland(1 ) in 1873 using a pair of inductors coupled by a ferromagnetic torus . extending the technique to high temperature measurements of iron in 1910 by e.m .",
    "terry(2 ) and measurements in high purity iron by r.m .",
    "borzoth(3 ) 1937 produced values for permeability orders of magnitude greater than statically determined values .",
    "the details of the magnetic domain motion in the ferromagnetic torus were examined in 1949(4 ) .",
    "the application of ampere s law assuming no internal sources of time dependent fields other than the source inductor was the basis of this transformer design and application . here a simplified form of this measurement is considered for isolating the material contributions to the responses that are not otherwise described by ampere s law .",
    "in addition , to my own problem of satisfactorily calibrating induction measurements on iron and steel to detect defects there is a set of other unanswered questions .",
    "the storage mechanisms involved in the operation of ferro resonant load leveling transformer patented by j. sola(5 ) in 1954 require a more detailed explanation .",
    "the anomalous eddy current loss(6 ) which is a large effect for induction heating in fe and fesi alloys also has not been accurately described .",
    "also , the steel corrosion inspection method `` remote field testing '' using slowly propagating , highly insensitive long range fields in low carbon steels(7 ) also requires an explanation .",
    "these unsolved problems coupled with the large conflict in the simplest experimental field reflection data to classical calculated values for ferromagnetic materials exhibits a weakness in our understanding .",
    "ferromagnetism is a quantum mechanical phenomena , but a macroscopic connection to the field equations of maxwell is essential to solving induction measurement problems . since the time of roland s introduction of the coupled transformer experiment , microscopic theories of elementary spin excitations have been developed to describe the temperature dependence of magnetization .",
    "the question of how a slowly varying time dependent induction @xmath3 interacts with individual spins , spin waves and structures such as magnetic domain boundaries ( mdb ) in iron and steel to produce the measured responses has remained an open question .",
    "spin wave theory developed as a lattice theory starting with considerations of the mechanics of a single one dimensional array of spins(8,9 ) .",
    "these early works form the basis for the extensive investigations that have continued to the present .",
    "one difficulty in the application of a lattice theory to iron is that it does not include the local lattice relaxation dependence to the magnetization .",
    "this is a large effect in iron and can be seen in the fitted plot of lattice parameter as a function of temperature(10 ) through the curie point in figure 1 . in this plot",
    "the linear expansion with temperature is removed so the non linear response of the lattice to temperature variations taken through the curie point become evident .",
    "the strains associated with the material below the curie point are significant .    c. the curve is similar to the saturation magnetization as a function of temperature .",
    "the total equivalent strain from room temperature to 770 @xmath4 is about @xmath5 due to magnetic ordering .",
    "* , width=576 ]    spin waves and photons are the bosons that allow an exchange of spin states between carriers in ferromagnetic metal such as iron .",
    "these exchanges in addition to the transport of carriers are how the spin system is modified by the application of external fields and induced currents",
    ". these two classes of effects in addition to the lattice relaxation , phonon scattering , determines the measured responses and the various ways in which energy is distributed or radiates from the metal .",
    "non saturated soft ferromagnetism that will be considered are partitioned by an array of mdb and the coupling between these regions will control the propagation of long range fields through the bulk of the sample .",
    "this couplings can be summaries in the first table .",
    "* table 1 : field and current couplings *    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     transition to and from the vacuum state to an excited spin wave state are allowed for all ferromagnetic materials without considering phonon interactions and the scattering of thermal spin waves into a belc .",
    "the last two transitions are between belc scattering interaction .",
    "these four transitions have only been easily seen in well annealed iron based alloys or glasses and were not evident in nickel or cobalt under similar test conditions . though the cobalt and nickel samples were not as well annealed as the iron specimens .",
    "these four transitions look to be from the scattering of belc alone and not a direct interaction with the applied field .",
    "the last two transitions require a spin wave in both bands so that angular momentum is conserved .",
    "this would not be possible in either nickel or cobalt and are not seen .",
    "the field dependent matrix elements do not seem to operate over the entire material to produce these paired states .",
    "they seemed to be limited to magnetic domain boundaries that can be perturbed by the fields .",
    "the surface of iron would not be a source of these paired spin waves because it is not a region in which the local magnetization goes through zero . to apply a surface to iron that would have this characteristic",
    "would make an enhanced source of these waves and the sample would be more sensitive to coupling with external fields without having the losses associated for a penetrating field .",
    "if a material surface is coated with a thin anti ferromagnetic layer over the iron , it maybe possible to use this new interface with the iron as an enhanced source of these paired spin waves .",
    "with the application of a transverse time dependent induction , @xmath6 , in iron and steel lifts the degeneracy in the phase of the magnetization of the spin wave and allows spin pairs across bands to couple forming @xmath2 states .",
    "the reduction of a coupled pair to a @xmath2 states within frequency ranges removes the strongest scattering interactions for the spin wave and allow its wave length to scale upwards by five order of magnitude .",
    "this is first detected by noting the effective mass of the spin wave has been scaled back by ten orders of magnitude .",
    "this leaves this new group of spin waves which are subject to bose - einstein statistics at sufficient but easily achievable densities to allow a formation of a bose - einstein like condensation all the way to the curie point .",
    "two other time dependent magnetization dispersion curves were also identified one with a coupled magneto - acoustic coupling that operates when these long wavelength spin waves have velocities below the velocity of sound and second dispersion curve found was a measure of the density of a new state that had a net zero momentum .",
    "this process of forming the belc for the freely propagating spin waves reduced the strong spin wave coupling to lattice as whole and allows the formation of a collective zero momentum bound state .",
    "this new field @xmath7 show a strong response at high frequencies and is also macroscopically large relative to the sample size . from the spatial representation of the belc wave functions",
    "the inter particle interaction energies were computed for these two spin wave fields and are consistent from what would be expected from a stable bec .",
    "the belcs formed are very weakly interacting with their environment though they interact strongly with each other .",
    "transition between belc states of different energy enables the creation of new states .",
    "the passage of these propagating magnetization through regions held above the curie point is not simply explained by one field or another .",
    "though it does appear that @xmath8 preferentially traverse this region due to the phase drop .",
    "the fraction of signal in each state as a function of temperature also has to known along with the gain as a function of temperature .",
    "returning to the original problem of putting maxwell s equations into a form to handle these problems now looks to be tractable with the solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equations and model for belc populations dynamics from the coupling of the field into these states and at low frequencies coupling in the elastic properties of the material .",
    "notation is simplified by this approach to the dynamic magnetic problem .",
    "these ideas should be useful in studying other ferromagnetic materials other than iron , which may not exhibit as many features as were found here .",
    "these effects will go along way in explaining a number of measurements made in steels over the years that were not understood .",
    "but of more general interest , the mechanics of multiple belc activity and boson mass are topics of interest in other branches of physics .",
    "the system studied here after careful analytical development may yield more insights because of the relative ease with which experiments can be done and ideas tested .",
    "i would like to acknowledge the careful and extensive measurement of high temperature eddy current responses in a variety of steels by mike bergerhouse that firmly established this problem , the discussions of signal transmission and noise through steels taken above the curie point with michael wallace that gave clues to the character of the radiation source , julian nobel for giving me an appreciations for the concept of mass and to steven wallace whose patient methods of attack on problems was the example i followed . editing to reduce these data to a readable form was generously performed by jerry dunn and michael wallace .",
    "the simple case of a reflector that is a magnetic conductor or insulator can be represented by a boundary value problem where the electric field and the magnetic induction are required to be continuous across the interface .",
