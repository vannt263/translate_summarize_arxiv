    "<S> we argue that for device - independent randomness generation  and other device - independent protocols where the devices are in the same lab  we can slightly relax the requirement of perfect isolation , and still retain most of the advantages of the device - independent approach , by allowing a little cross - talk between the devices . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up the possibility of using existent experimental systems with high data rates , such as josephson phase qubits on the same chip , thereby bringing device - independent randomness generation much closer to practical application . *    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _  the great advantage of device - independent ( di ) protocols is their reliance on a small set of tests , which are nevertheless sufficient to certify that they are performing properly . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by carrying out nonlocality tests on entangled quantum systems . in particular , no assumptions are made regarding the inner workings of the devices , such as the hilbert space dimension of the underlying quantum systems , etc . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each device is treated as a ` black box ' with knobs and registers for selecting and displaying ( classical ) inputs and outputs . </S>",
    "<S> applications include quantum key - distribution @xcite , coin flipping @xcite , state tomography @xcite , genuine multi - partite entanglement detection @xcite , self - testing of quantum computers @xcite , as well as di randomness generation ( rg ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is often remarked that di cryptographic protocols remain secure even if the devices have been provided , or sabotaged , by an adversary . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario , while conceptually fascinating , is of little ( if any ) practical relevance . </S>",
    "<S> this is because ( i ) there are many types of attacks available to a malicious provider  </S>",
    "<S> the majority being classical  that eliminating them all is an enormous task ; ( ii ) in any case we assume the existence of honest providers of e.g. the source of randomness , the jamming technology to prevent information leakage from the labs , or the classical devices used to process the data . </S>",
    "<S> a scenario where one can trust the latter , but an honest provider for the quantum devices can not be found , is highly implausible .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual advantage of di protocols is that they allow us to monitor the performance of the devices irrespectively of noise , imperfections , lack of knowledge regarding their inner workings , or limited control over them . indeed , even if the devices were obtained from a trusted provider and thoroughly inspected , many things can still unintentionally go wrong ( as demonstrated by the attacks on commercial quantum key - distribution systems @xcite , which exploited unintentional design flaws ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this problem is particularly acute in the case of di rg , as it is very difficult even for honest parties to maufacture reliable randomness generators ( whether classical or quantum ) and monitor them for malfunction . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of randomness in a di manner solves many of the shortcomings of customary rg protocols , since , as mentioned above , the degree of violation of a bell inequality provides an accurate estimate of the amount of randomness generated irrespectively of experimental imperfections and lack of control . </S>",
    "<S> di rg has so far been proven secure against adversaries with classical side - information about the devices ( which is the relevant case when the provider is trusted ) for arbitrary bell inequalities and degrees of violation @xcite , and against adversaries with quantum side - information in the case of very high violation of the chsh inequality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , di rg is experimentally highly challenging . </S>",
    "<S> it requires a bell experiment with the detection loophole closed and with the quantum systems isolated from one another .    </S>",
    "<S> a proof of principle experiment was reported in @xcite using two ions in separate vacuum traps , but this system operates at an extremely low rate ( @xmath0 ) , precluding any practical application . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there exist today experiments involving , for example , two josephson phase qubits on the same chip coupled by a radio frequency resonator @xcite , or two ions in the same trap coupled via their vibrational modes @xcite , which allow for bell violating experiments ( with the detection loophole closed ) at much higher data rates ( @xmath1 ) .    in these experiments </S>",
    "<S> the quantum systems are very close to one another . </S>",
    "<S> this proximity provides the non - negligible coupling required for high entanglement generation rates . </S>",
    "<S> adapting di rg to these types of experiments would bring it much closer to real - life application . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that precisely because the systems are close to one another and non - negligibly coupled , they can no longer be considered as completely isolated ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the couplings involved ) . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present work is to show how to take this coupling into account by relaxing slightly the assumptions behind the di approach , while keeping as much as possible all of its advantages .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by showing how to derive bounds on the rg rate in a di setting given a known amount of cross - talk ( ct ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we present methods for estimating the amount of ct present in an experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is then illustrated on josephson phase qubits , showing that efficient di rg is possible using already established technology . </S>",
    "<S> we start first , however , by recalling briefly the essential ingredients of di rg relevant to our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to @xcite for a more detailed presentation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ bell inequalities and device - independent randomness generation _  a bell experiment is characterized by the probabilities @xmath2 of obtaining the outcomes ( or outputs ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 given the measurement settings ( or inputs ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a bell expression @xmath7 is a linear function of these probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the chsh inequality has the form @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> to any bell expression , one can associate a bound on the randomness of the outputs given the inputs @xmath5 and @xmath6 through a function @xmath9 such that @xmath10 holds for any @xmath11 for which @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath9 should be monotonically decreasing and concave in @xmath13 ( if not we can take its concave hull ) . </S>",
    "<S> higher values of @xmath14 imply less randomness , in particular when @xmath15 the system is fully deterministic .    </S>",
    "<S> given knowledge of such a function and the degree of bell violation @xmath13 observed in an experiment where the devices are used @xmath16 times in succession , one can infer a lower bound on the min - entropy of the measurement outcomes . by applying a randomness extractor to the resulting string of outcomes , </S>",
    "<S> one then obtains a new private string of random numbers of length @xmath17 which is arbitrarily close ( up to a security parameter ) to the uniform distribution . depending on the assumptions made regarding the devices and the adversary </S>",
    "<S> , such a protocol may also require an initial random seed ( in which case one talks about di randomness expansion ) that may be polynomially @xcite or exponentially @xcite smaller than the output string .    </S>",
    "<S> _ device - independent randomness generation with weak cross - talk _  in the security analysis of di rg protocols the assumption that the two bell violating devices are isolated from one another only appears in the derivation of the bound @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if we introduce a similar bound @xmath19 that is valid in the presence of a given amount of ct @xmath20 ( defined below ) , then the rest of the reasoning of @xcite will apply without modification .    to define such a ct - dependent bound </S>",
    "<S> , we write the probabilities observed in a bell experiment as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a povm on @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty with respect to the standard mathematical description of bell experiments is in allowing the measurement @xmath27 to act collectively on the two systems . </S>",
    "<S> we will say that such a collective measurement requires no more than @xmath20 amount of ct if there exists a product povm @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 for all combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition restricts how far each collective povm may be from a product of two independent povms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath30 the @xmath27 can be expressed as products , while when @xmath31 they are unconstrained .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now a fixed value of @xmath20 and a bell violation @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then the solution of the following program provides the minimal amount of randomness @xmath32 compatible with @xmath13 and @xmath20 : @xmath33 where the optimization runs over the set @xmath34 specifying the state , measurements , and the hilbert spaces . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation is therefore di in spirit , since the bound is formulated without fixing the dimension of the hilbert spaces , nor how the measurements are implemented , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> upper bounds on the optimization problem eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) can be obtained using the techniques of @xcite , which relax the problem to a hierarchy of semi - definite programs ( sdps ) . in particular , the resulting series of bounds is guaranteed to converge to the true solution . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , depending on the problem , even the lowest order relaxation may be computationally intractable . </S>",
    "<S> we may then obtain a weaker bound in terms of @xmath35  the solution in the absence of ct . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 be the state and povms corresponding to the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) , and let @xmath40 and @xmath41 . from the last constraint in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) we have that @xmath42 , and so @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( in the case of the chsh inequality for instance @xmath45 ) . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> the last two inequalities imply that @xmath46 fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 displays upper bounds on @xmath47 obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 2 ] ) in the case of the chsh inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the last constraint in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) implies that the signaling  the extent to which the output of one device depends on the input of the other  is constrained . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if to each input @xmath5 and each input @xmath6 correspond @xmath48 outputs , @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the case of zero signaling , one has @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to derive a simpler bound on @xmath52 , depending solely on the amount of signaling present , in contrast to the bounds eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) and ( [ bound 2 ] ) , which rely on the full structure of quantum mechanics . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we define the maximal amount of signaling allowed as @xmath53 when @xmath54 , @xmath11 resides within the no - signaling polytope @xcite , while when @xmath55 @xmath11 resides within a larger , higher - dimensional polytope . </S>",
    "<S> the bound can be obtained by solving the linear program @xmath56 , given that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . in the case of the chsh inequality </S>",
    "<S> , one can show that ( see appendix a ) @xmath60 this bound applies to any post - quantum theory which restricts the amount of signaling ( as well as to quantum mechanics ) .    _ estimating the amount of cross - talk _  </S>",
    "<S> we have just seen how the introduction of a new security parameter @xmath20 , quantifying the amount of ct between the devices , allows us to extend the scope of di rg to settings with a limited amount of ct . to apply this approach , we therefore need a reliable prior estimate of @xmath20 , and means of guaranteeing or verifying that the ct will not exceed this estimate during latter operations of the devices . </S>",
    "<S> this obviously requires some modeling of the devices inner workings . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is impossible to upper - bound the amount of ct from first principles only or from any set of observed data @xmath11 alone , since communicating devices can deterministically reproduce any @xmath11 , and therefore simulate any degree of bell violation .    at first </S>",
    "<S> , this may seem an unwelcome departure from the purely di approach ( i.e. @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our approach has the advantage over fully device - dependent approaches that only a _ single _ </S>",
    "<S> parameter @xmath20 must be device-_dependently _ estimated to ensure that the protocol performs properly , and this same parameter is used irrespectively of the underlying physical realization . </S>",
    "<S> morever , even in purely di protocols the absence of communication can not be deduced from the observed data alone , and to verify that there is indeed no - communication will necessarily involve putting our trust in certain general assumptions regarding the behavior of the devices , or relying on some trusted external hardware . seen in this light , our approach is not very different from the standard ( di ) one , except that instead of verifying in some trusted way that @xmath30 , we must verify that @xmath20 is no greater than some finite value . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our approach allows as a safeguard to set @xmath20 to be greater than its expected value  a feature that may be useful even in for purely di protocols with ( allegedly ) non - communicating devices .    </S>",
    "<S> even though a maximal amount of ct @xmath20 can not be guaranteed without some modeling of the devices , there are several ways to lower - bound @xmath20 from the observed data @xmath11 only . if the devices were not fabricated by an adversary and do not act maliciously , then these lower bounds may provide good estimates of @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple way to lower - bound @xmath20 in a di manner is via the degree of violation of the no - signaling conditions eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sig ] ) , computed from the observed data @xmath11 . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sig ] ) it follows that @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> improved di bounds are obtainable , however , reflecting the fact that @xmath62 does not capture all of the information contained in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal amount of ct that is compatible with a given @xmath11 is given by the solution of the following optimization problem @xmath63 which can be lower - bounded using the techniques of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that this bound is optimal , since the optimization runs over all possible states @xmath64 and sets of projectors @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfying the constraints in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound 1 ] ) . that it constitutes an improvement over the bound provided by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sig ] ) is seen by considering the case of post - quantum non - signaling distributions ( including those that do not violate tsirelson s bound @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such distributions will not give rise to a non - vanishing bound via eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , since they can not be realized quantumly without communication , they will give rise to a non - vanishing bound via eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ct ] ) . see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible of course that the true value of @xmath20 is not revealed by the above lower bounds ( for instance , points in qr in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 can be reproduced either with or without ct and thus the real value of @xmath20 can not be unambiguously determined from the observed data @xmath11 alone ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one can also adopt a more device - dependent approach to estimating @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if the lower bound provided by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ct ] ) equals zero , one can vary the state and the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> such a procedure could in principle reveal the presence of any fixed interaction hamiltonian @xmath68 , since it has been shown that for any such interaction there exists a strategy involving only local operations and classical communication that reveals the presence of the interaction as signaling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not know of any systematic way for finding this strategy if @xmath68 is unknown , nor do we know how to relate in a systematic way the observed signaling to @xmath68 .    finally , by modeling the physical systems , their interaction and the measurement procedure , it is possible to estimate the amount of ct . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this last approach are given below .    _ </S>",
    "<S> candidates for real - life implementation _  a system ideally suited for the implemenation of di rg will ( i ) give rise to a sufficiently high bell violation with the detection loophole kept closed , ( ii ) exhibit a negligible amount of ct , and ( iii ) allow for very high data rates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss below an experiment based on josephson phase qubits , which meets all of these requirements . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is based on trapped ions , as discussed in appendix b.    in the chsh experiment of @xcite two josephson phase qubits , coupled by a radio frequency strip resonator , are used . </S>",
    "<S> the qubits are located on the same chip , separated by @xmath69 , and are entangled by successively coupling them to the strip resonator . </S>",
    "<S> single qubit rotations are effected by applying microwaves at the resonance frequency of the corresponding qubit . read - out is effected by letting the excited state tunnel to an auxiliary state macroscopically distinct from both the ground state and the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> all operations can be carried out on time scales significantly shorter than @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a recent review of josephson phase qubits experiments see @xcite . )    the constant coupling between the qubits gives rise to some ct . from the analysis of the experimental set up performed in @xcite and @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that the most significant contribution to the ct occurs during the read - out : the tunneling of one qubit from the excited state to a macroscopically distinct state sometimes forces the other qubit to tunnel when in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to estimate the ct at @xmath71 ( see appendix c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same value is also obtained by solving the second order relaxation of eq . </S>",

    "<S> this shows that useful randomness is extractable from this experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _  the analysis of any di protocol requires that we specify the amount of ct between the devices ( irrespectively of whether it is vanishing or finite )  a requirement that can not be fully verified or implemented in a di manner . in this work </S>",
