    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) have long been considered to be the primary acceleration sites of cosmic - ray particles below the energy of the so - called _ knee _ in the cosmic ray spectrum , @xmath4 .",
    "the first evidence for multi - tev acceleration was the discovery of synchrotron x - ray emission from the shell of the supernova remnant sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "more direct evidence for the presence of multi - tev particles ( electrons and/or protons ) inside supernova remnants was provided by cangaroo s discovery of tev @xmath3-rays from another and brighter shell - like snr in tev , rx j1713.7@xmath53946 @xcite .",
    "recent high quality morphological and spectral studies with the hess tev imager combined with the x - ray imager such as asca , found a good kev - tev correlation from rx j1713.7@xmath53946 ( @xcite ) and rxj 0852.0@xmath54622 ( @xcite ) , indicating that both the x - rays and the tev @xmath3-rays are emitted by the tev particles in the snr shell .",
    "the extremely thin x - ray filaments with a 0.02pc width in sn  1006 @xcite , as well as the x - ray variability on time scales of a year from rx j1713.7@xmath53946 ( @xcite ) strongly support the efficient acceleration of particles by snr shocks .",
    "up to now , many observational results support that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are major sources of galactic tev cosmic rays .",
    "the young ( @xmath6 old ) supernova remnant cassiopeia  a  is one of several snrs from which non - thermal x - rays and tev @xmath3-rays have both been detected ( x - rays:@xcite , tev:@xcite ) . in x - rays cassiopeia",
    "a  seems to consist of a number of thermal and non - thermal x - ray emitting knots / filaments ( @xcite ) .",
    "although some non - thermal emission is associated with the forward shock , the dominant source of non - thermal emission may be identified with the reverse shock regions ( @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "it therefore is a unique object in which we can study the particle acceleration by the reverse shock , because for the other snrs the acceleration seems to originate from the forward shock region only ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the composition of the high - energy cosmic rays ( @xmath2 pev ) might be made up of elements heavier than helium ( @xcite and reference there in ) .",
    "the study of the acceleration in the reverse shock is interesting since the ejecta is dominated by these heavy elements .",
    "the overall x - ray spectra from cassiopeia  a  are described by optically thin - thermal emission ( line emission by highly ionized heavy elements and bremsstrahlung ) accompanied by non - thermal emission extending beyond 10 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the basic characterization of the two continuum components  such as the total intensity , spectral shapes ( temperature of thermal bremsstrahlung and the shape of synchrotron spectrum ) , and the emission sites  has been somewhat controversial . for example",
    ", @xcite fitted the broadband spectrum obtained with rxte using thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath7 kev and a broken power law with @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a break energy of 15.9 kev , while @xcite fitted the beppo - sax spectrum of cassiopeia  a  with @xmath10 kev and a power law with @xmath11 ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a suzaku study of the x - ray emission from cassiopeia  a. the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) enables us to make hard x - ray images and spectra up to @xmath12 . by combining the xis with the companion instrument , hard x - ray detector ( hxd )",
    ", we present a wide - band continuum spectrum ( 3.440  kev ) .",
    "the suzaku satellite @xcite has carried out three observations of cassiopeia  a , one in 2005 september , and two in 2006 february .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tabl : obslog ] .",
    "in all the three observations , cassiopeia  a  was pointed at around the geometrical center of the xis detector ( the xis nominal position ) .",
    ".suzaku observations of cassiopeia  a [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the line energy of fe - k@xmath13 is linked to 1.014 times as high as that of ni - k@xmath0 .",
    "+ fit range : xis : 3.43.6 and 4.214 kev , hxd : 1540 kev .",
    "the thermal and non - thermal components of the model are also drawn with solid lines .",
    "the non - thermal component dominates the continuum flux.,width=453 ]     to fe - k@xmath13 lines for a given electon tempereture ( solid line ) .",
    "the yellow area is the best - fit ratio obtained from the line modelling ( see text ) .",
    "we used the nei code in which the ionization equilibrium collisional plasma is assumed .",
    "the unit of the parameter @xmath14 is s @xmath15 .",
    ", width=680 ]      figure  [ cr ] shows the zoomed - up xis spectrum in the 5.0 - 7.0 kev band .",
    "the residuals in the fitted spectrum shows a signature of cr k - shell emission .",
    "this weak signature was only found after the accumulation of all available data of the 1st and 3rd observations , and by adding up the data of four ccds .",
    "furthermore , in order to bring out the signal in figure  [ cr ] we used a courser binning than in figure  [ xisspec ] .    since the energy band below 5kev may be affected by the group of ca - k emission line , we selected the energy band ( 5 - 7kev ) to look for a weak emission line .",
    "we fitted the data in the 57 kev band by using a power law and gaussian line for fe - k profile .",
    "the residual indicates a weak line - like feature around 5.6 kev .",
    "we therefore introduce a gaussian line around 5.6 kev that can be a cr - k@xmath0 line . in this way , we modeled the continuum with a single cut - off power - law model and two lines with gaussian functions : one for the possible cr - k@xmath0 line and the other for the fe - k@xmath0 line . due to the limited statistics",
    ", we assumed the same line broadening , i.e. , gaussian sigma , for both lines . the best - fits and their residuals around the cr - k@xmath0 band",
    "are shown in figure  [ crk ] .",
    "we found the f - test probability of non - presence of cr - k@xmath0 is around 10@xmath16 .",
    "the best - fit gaussian energies are @xmath17 kev for cr - k@xmath0 and @xmath18 kev for fe - k@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "line differs by @xmath26  ev between the two different dataset ( tables  [ 4gauss ] and [ cr - line ] ) .",
    "however , the discussion we made later is independent on the calibration error of the absolute energy scale . ]",
    "we have obtained a 3.440 kev continuum spectrum summed over the entire remnant with suzaku .",
    "it is now recognized that the continuum emission of cassiopeia  a   in this bandpass is comprised mainly of the two components : ( 1 ) thermal bremsstrahlung by shock - heated electrons mostly in the reverse - shocked ejecta , and ( 2 ) synchrotron radiation produced by multi - tev electrons .",
    "recent studies emphasize that the synchrotron component also should originate predominantly in the reverse - shocked ejecta ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting an interesting possibility that multi - tev particles can be accelerated in supernova reverse shocks .",
    "not only synchrotron radiation but also the non - thermal bremsstrahlung was proposed to contribute to the non - thermal compornent @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies reported facts against the non - thermal bremsstrahlung : the lack of line - emission in the continuum areas @xcite , compton - cooling @xcite , and fast variability in the knots @xcite .",
    "we think the contribution of the non - thermal bremsstrahlung is minor .",
    "we confirm the hard x - ray enhancement in the west ( `` the western spot '' ) as shown in the 1114 kev xis image ( fig .",
    "the non - thermal continuum dominance in the west was previously reported by a 911 kev image made with beppo - sax ( @xcite ) and a 8.115 kev image with xmm - newton ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that in the western part of cassiopeia  a most x - ray synchrotron originates in the reverse shocks , and identified the reason for the synchrotron enhancement as a locally higher reverse shock velocity of @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , we found a hint that the peak of tev @xmath3-rays measured by hegra and magic coincides with the location of the synchrotron - dominated western spot",
    ". this suggests that the tev @xmath3-rays also can originate from reverse - shocked ejecta .",
    "the possible coincidence of bright x - ray continuum emission with tev emission reinforces the idea that the x - ray continuum in the west is indeed synchrotron radiation , irrespective of the tev radiation mechanism . @xcite,@xcite and @xcite argued that the multi - tev emission is likely to have an hadronic origin .",
    "our finding of a possible kev - tev correlation suggests that the accelerated multi - tev hadrons coul d be heavy elements ( i.e. , ejecta ) accelerated by the reverse shock .",
    "the spatially most detailed information about the x - ray continuum emission in cassiopeia  a   came from chandra observations .",
    "the superb angular resolution ( @xmath20 ) of chandra made it possible to fully resolve the arcsecond - scale filamentary or knotty structures as well as more diffuse emission .",
    "the extreme brightness of cassiopeia  a  and long exposures allocated for the acis observations ( @xcite ) allows for meaningful spectral fitting of arcsecond - scale pixels . based on pixel - by - pixel photon indices determined for the 4.26 kev continuum band using a power - law fit in each @xmath21 pixel ,",
    "@xcite have derived the total contribution of the synchrotron component in the 4.26 kev band as @xmath22% , on the assumption that the continuum shapes characterized by @xmath23 are of thermal origin .",
    "the synchrotron flux relative to thermal bremsstrahlung depends on the choice of @xmath24 . using figure 10 of @xcite , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "translate in @xmath27% and @xmath28% , respectively . the difficulties in disentangling the two types of continuum emission stem from the tantalizing fact that they can be co - spatial , as well as from the projection effects .",
    "moreover , the limited spectral coverage of chandra ( @xmath29 kev ) does not allow to perform spectral decoupling .",
    "a complimentary approach , which the present work takes , is measuring a wide band x - ray spectrum extending to hard x - rays in order to break the degeneracy between the thermal bremsstrahlung and synchrotron components .",
    "a drawback of this approach is a lack of imaging capability above 15 kev to resolve the spatial structures of hard x - ray emission .",
    "we are bound to the analysis of a wide - band spectrum integrated over the entire face of the remnant with a loss of morphological information .",
    "still , we would be able to obtain meaningful results since the variation of electron temperatures determined by line modeling seems reasonably small , ranging from 12 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "though this issue should be examined using chandra data in future work , we here assume that possible temperature distributions do not have a major impact on our discussion .",
    "our spectral modeling of the overall suzaku xis+pin spectrum in 3.440 kev ( excluding emission lines ) with a bremsstrahlung+power law ( br+pl ) model yielded the best - fit temperature of @xmath30 kev and photon index of @xmath31 with a thermal - to - nonthermal ratio of @xmath32 ( see table 3 ) . compared with previous results on the temperature obtained with chandra , typically 12 kev",
    ", the br+pl model gives a too - high temperature for bremsstrahlung . from figure 2 of @xcite , in line - dominated thermal inner ring in the north and east , thermal bremsstrahlung has a temperature @xmath33 kev in most cases . on the other hand , a bremsstrahlung+cut - off power - law ( br+cpl ) model resulted in the best - fit cut - off energy of @xmath34 kev , with @xmath35 .",
    "irrespective of the actual spectral shape , we can conclude that the synchrotron component ( integrated over the remnant ) in the x - ray band should be described by a convex - shaped continuum , not by a simple power law .",
    "this idea is independently supported by the photon index map given by @xcite .",
    "the derived cut - off energy ( assuming @xmath36 ) of @xmath34 kev is consistent with that expected from shock acceleration theory ( with bohm diffusion ) given a typical reverse shock speed @xmath37 of @xmath38 , as well as the x - ray variability of synchrotron filaments ( @xmath39 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting consequence of the spectral decomposition discussed above is a fairly small value of @xmath400.10.2 .",
    "this implies that even a 46 kev image made with chandra should be dominated by the synchrotron component .",
    "the electron temperature of 12 kev corresponds to @xmath416.13.8 in the 4.26 kev band .",
    "if we assume the filaments with @xmath423.8 , equivalent to @xmath43 kev , are occupied by the thermal emission , figure 10 of @xcite also shows a thermal - to - nonthermal ratio of @xmath44 , which is consistent with our value .",
    "the small value of @xmath400.10.2 means the equivalent widths after subtracting a synchrotron spectrum become quite large .",
    "in particular , the equivalent width of fe - k@xmath0 should be as high as @xmath2714 kev , requiring iron - rich ejecta for fe - k@xmath0 line emission . in the western regions , outside the bright ejecta ring ,",
    "extreme iron - rich ejecta were found ( iron composition by mass amounting to 90% ) , that likely originates from the @xmath0-rich freezeout process , which occurred in the innermost ejecta layer ( @xcite ) . the very large equivalent width ( ew ) of fe - k@xmath0 inferred for the integrated suzaku xis spectrum",
    "may be understood if the fe line comes in large part from @xmath0-rich freezeout ejecta .",
    "indeed , the presence of such @xmath0-rich freezeout ejecta is required by the observed @xmath45 emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the line center energies are summarized in table  @xmath59 for cr and fe emission lines as well as the energy ratio , @xmath58 , between them .",
    "emission lines in w49b are ionized to he - like ions while those in tycho are in low ionization state .",
    "if cr and fe are in neutral / he / h - like ion , @xmath58 is 0.845/0.848/0.851 .",
    "@xmath58 is quite insensitive to the ionization state .",
    "the similar argument can be valid not only for @xmath58 , but also for the doppler shifting . if the expanding speeds of cr and fe are the same , @xmath58 is not sensitive to their doppler velocity at all .",
    "according to the nucleosynthesis theory ( @xcite ) , @xmath60cr is produced through explosive oxygen and silicon burning as itself , while the most abundant isotopes of chromium , @xmath61cr and @xmath62cr are produced through @xmath63fe decay .",
    "the most abundant isotope of iron , @xmath64fe is produced through @xmath64ni decay .",
    "they are generated in a similar location deep inside the star .",
    "therefore , they must have been ejected with similar explosion speed and have experienced as similar ionization time scale .",
    "this is consistent with our results that the observed value of @xmath58 is identical to each snr within statistical uncertainties ( table  @xmath59 ) .    after submitting our paper for publication ,",
    "we became aware of an independent paper by @xcite on the same subject on the cr - k line .",
    "their conclusions are very similar to those presented here : cr and fe are colocated .",
    "the @xmath58 value of @xmath65 we measured with the suzaku data for cassiopeia  a  is in very good agreement with theirs of @xmath66 using the chandra data .",
    "1 .   suzaku observed the young supernova remnant cassiopeia  a , and detected the broadband continuum from 3.4 to 40 kev .",
    "the 5-@xmath67 upper limit in the 150500 kev band is @xmath68 erg / s/@xmath69 by assuming the photon index of unity .",
    "the line - flux ratio @xmath70 , is consistent with the electron temperature measured with the continuum modelling , but within the large error .",
    "we modeled the x - ray continuum spectrum in the 3.440 kev band summed over the entire remnant . for a model",
    ", we assumed the simplest combination of the single thermal bremsstrahlung and the single non - thermal cut - off power - law models .",
    "we found that the x - ray continuum in the 3.440 kev band is dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "the thermal - to - nonthermal fraction of the continuum flux in the 410 kev band is @xmath20.10.2 .",
    "the non - thermal continuum in the 3.440 kev band is reproduced with a cut - off power - law model with a cut - off energy of @xmath71  kev .",
    "the cut - off energy can be understood by the diffusive shock acceleration at a shock velocity of as high as @xmath72 km s@xmath49 .",
    "we report on the detection of cr - k@xmath0 at 5.61 kev in cassiopeia  a. cassiopeia  a  is the third object for which the cr - k@xmath0 line emission has been detected .",
    "the elements cr as well as fe are consistent with being generated in the region deep inside the supernova , since they seem to have had similar ionization history .",
    "a hard x - ray image of the continuum emission was obtained with the xis .",
    "its brightest spot appears at the western part of the reverse shock .",
    "the xis spectrum below 14 kev is smoothly connected to that of the non - imaging detector hxd covering the energy band above 15 kev .",
    "therefore , the 10 kev band image of the xis is likely the good approximation of the image above 10 kev .",
    "we also found a hint that the hard x - ray peak possibly coincides with the tev peak detected by hegra and magic .",
    "since the tev emission is likely to be hadronic origin , the possible kev - tev correlation suggests that the tev hadron could be presumably accelerated in a reverse shock .",
    "this is the first observational hint that the high - energy hadrons as well as leptons can be accelerated in the reverse shock in a supernova remnant .",
    "a tighter constaraint of the tev position with deep exposures will be crutial to test this hint .",
