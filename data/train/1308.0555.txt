    "the mechanism is usually referred to as binary coded decimal ( bcd for short ) .",
    "for instance , the digit 9 is represented as @xmath2 .",
    "when we input the integer @xmath3 using numeric keys ` 7 ' and ` 9 ' , it is first represented as two strings @xmath4 .",
    "we here omit the other leftmost bits in each byte which represent numeric type or sign .",
    "the two strings then will be converted into the resulting binary representation @xmath5 .    in 1988 .",
    "b. shirazi et al @xcite investigated the problem of vlsi designs for redundant binary - coded decimal addition . in 2006 , a. kaivani et al @xcite discussed the conversion methods of decimal - to - binary . in the same year ,",
    "h. thapliyal et al @xcite focused on the integration of bcd adder with cmos .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate another method to convert decimal input data into binary form .",
    "it takes full use of binary coded decimal mechanism to completely eliminate operations of comparison .",
    "it is directly based on addition operation and bit operation  shift .",
    "the method is very easily implemented by software .",
    "the cost analysis shows that this method is more preferable than the classical method .",
    "there are basically two ways to transform a decimal number into a binary number : comparison with descending powers of two and subtraction and short division by two with remainder .",
    "the first method proceeds as follows .",
    "use a base 2 table from right to left . given",
    "a decimal number for conversion , find the greatest power of 2 that can be included in it .",
    "write 1 for the binary digit first on the left and then subtract that number from the decimal one .",
    "move to the next power of two , record the identifier with 0 ( if the rest can not contain the next power of two ) or 1 ( if it can contain it ) . continue making the same comparison and subtractions until there are nothing left .",
    "list all 1 and 0 symbols orderly .",
    "another method to identify the binary counterpart of a decimal number is through division by two . here",
    "are the steps that you will have to follow :    \\1 .",
    "you will have to divide your number by two . but first , to succeed into visualizing your work , write down 2 followed by a parenthesis and then the number you want to convert .",
    "the quotient then must be written under the long division symbol , and , next to it the remainder from the operation .",
    "( if the number divides to two perfectly , the remainder will be 0 , if it does not , it will be 1 ) .",
    "you will continue to repeat the operation , always writing down the remainders .",
    "\\4 . in the end",
    ", you will have a column of 1 and 0 which you will have to read from the bottom to the top .",
    "this will be your binary counterpart for the decimal number you wanted to convert .",
    "the process of converting decimal input data into binary form is generally accomplished by the following method which is based on division operation @xcite . given an integer @xmath6 , we can obtain its binary representation @xmath7 as follows : @xmath8 stopping when @xmath9 .",
    "unlike the general division operation , the conversion of decimal - to - binary only requires a special division because an input number is represented by binary coded decimal mechanism in common pc . concretely speaking ,",
    "the conversion of @xmath4 into @xmath5 could be accomplished as follows .",
    "* set up the following division table + [ cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 : comparison between method 1 and method 2    in theory , the cost of an operation for looking up division table is greater than that of an operation for computing @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the conversion method based on addition operation is more efficient than the method based on division table .",
    "method 2 has a special advantage over method 1 .",
    "we can use method 2 _ in parallel _ because eq.(1 ) can be written as @xmath12\\times 10^i \\\\ & + & ( \\cdots ( ( x_i\\times 10 + x_{i-1})\\times 10+x_{i-2})\\times 10 + \\cdots ) \\times 10+x_{1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas , method 1 can not be used in such way .",
    "we investigate two conversion methods of decimal - to - binary .",
    "the analysis shows that the conversion method based on addition operation is more preferable than the general method which is based directly on division operation .",
    "thus the current input / output translation hardware to convert between the internal digit pairs and the external standard bcd codes can be reasonably removed .",
