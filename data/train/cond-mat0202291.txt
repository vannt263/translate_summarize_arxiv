    "the properties of @xmath0 centers in narrow quantum wells have become a subject of considerable interest during the past years @xcite . in very narrow wells",
    "this system can be considered as a two - dimensional counterpart of the atomic @xmath4 ion . a frequently used compound for current experimental investigations",
    "( see for example ref.@xcite ) of such systems are layers of gaas / algaas . the high mobility i.e. small effective mass of the electrons and the comparatively large dielectricity constant of this semiconductor material allow us to study strong magnetic field effects in the laboratory .",
    "both the two - dimensional character of the motion of the electrons and the external magnetic field makes the ground state of the system more tightly bound than that of the field - free threedimensional @xmath4 ion .",
    "considering neutral donors @xmath5 the planar electron density of the 2d donor is enhanced significantly compared to that of the 3d donor .",
    "the form of the corresponding charge distribution makes the interaction of an additional distant charge with the neutral donor very different for the three - dimensional compared to the two - dimensional situation . in three dimensions it is well - known that , for a fixed center ( nucleus ) , the combination of a magnetic field with the 3d long - range attractive polarization forces lead to an infinite number of bound states for the negative donor @xcite . in two dimensions the long - range interaction is of repulsive character .",
    "indeed , it was shown by larsen and mccann @xcite , that an electron situated far from a 2d @xmath5 center experiences an overall repulsive potential which prevails both the attractive coulomb attraction due to the center and the attractive polarization forces . for distances of the order of the extension of the neutral donor , exchange and correlation",
    "effects play a major role with respect to the binding mechanism of the additional electron .",
    "two - dimensional @xmath0 centers in magnetic fields are described by a three - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "the finite difference numerical method @xcite allows us to solve this schrdinger equation without any simplifications or approximations with respect to the geometry of the wave function , correlation effects etc . due to this property of our computational approach",
    "it will be here possible to obtain a definite answer on the ground state energy and the number of bound states of the two - dimensional @xmath0 center in magnetic fields .",
    "the critical values of the field strengths that are associated with the appearance of the bound states will be determined .",
    "one of the major motivations for the present work are the different theoretical values for the ground state energy of a two - dimensional negative donor with and without magnetic field existing in the literature .",
    "variational calculations @xcite on the onehand and monte carlo simulations @xcite on the otherhand yield uncompatible predictions for the ground state energies .",
    "this puzzle will be resolved within the present work .",
    "the hamiltonian of our two - dimensional system of two interacting electrons with an effective mass @xmath6 and a singly charged positive ion placed into a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane can be written in cartesian coordinates @xmath7 as @xmath8 here we use the units @xmath9 cm for the length , @xmath10ev for the energy and @xmath11 t for the magnetic field strength .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mass of the free electron , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the dielectricity constant of the semiconductor material , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . the spin terms are omitted .",
    "in contrast to variational calculations we are not biased by using a particular ansatz for the variational wave function but will perform a full grid solution to the schrdinger equation that allows to control and estimate the remaining minor deviation from the exact eigenfunctions and eigenvalues . in the following we provide an outline of our approach which embodies various properties and transformations of the hamiltonian and the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "transforming the electronic degrees of freedom to polar coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 yields for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham01 ] )    @xmath21    the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian are the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham01 ] ) if we require them to be periodic with period @xmath22 with respect to the variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham02 ] ) should also be eigenfunctions of the @xmath25-projection of the total orbital angular momentum operator which is a conserved quantity ie .",
    "@xmath26 with @xmath27 introducing the coordinates @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 we have @xmath31 for these coordinates the hamiltonian takes on the appearance @xmath32 eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath33 read as follows @xmath34 we therefore have @xmath35 with @xmath36 this hamiltonian depends on three degrees of freedom @xmath37 and the corresponding schrdinger equation can therefore be solved for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues by applying our finite - difference method @xcite .",
    "the coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in the domain @xmath40 with zero boundary conditions for infinity . the corresponding domain and boundary conditions for the angle @xmath41 have to be analyzed in more detail .    from equation ( [ eq : eq009 ] )",
    "one can conclude that solutions of the schrdinger equation belonging to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham06 ] ) should be considered in the domain @xmath42 with cyclic boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to eigenfunctions that can be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to interparticle exchange .",
    "the first correspond to spin singlet states whereas the second yield spin triplet states . beyond this",
    "we encounter additional eigenfunctions of the operator ( [ eq : ham06 ] ) that are not eigenfunctions of our initial hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham01 ] ) i.e. these eigenfunctions do not describe physical solutions . indeed , exploiting certain symmetries of the wavefunction it is possible to confine the domain of the angle @xmath41 to @xmath43 for the schrdinger equation belonging to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham06 ] ) . as a consequence",
    "the non - physical solutions are excluded . for the states with @xmath44 solutions can be obtained in an even smaller domain @xmath45 .    the numerical finite - difference method employed here to solve the eigenvalue problem for",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham06 ] ) is a modification of the approach developed in previous works devoted to atoms in strong magnetic @xcite and electric fields ( see@xcite and references therein ) and contains , in particular , technical aspects used in three - dimensional problems @xcite .",
    "our computational procedure consists of the following main steps .",
    "the nodes have to be chosen in the spatial domain @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( or @xmath45 ) .",
    "the values of the wavefunctions at the positions of the nodes are the numerical representation of the solutions of the initial differential equations .",
    "the nodes of the three - dimensional mesh in the space @xmath37 are placed at all the points with coordinates @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are sets of the mesh node coordinates along the corresponding axes .",
    "for the coordinate @xmath41 it is natural to use a uniform mesh with nodes at @xmath53 for the region @xmath43 ( case @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 for the region @xmath45 ( case @xmath44 ) , where @xmath56 is the number of nodes in the direction @xmath41 . for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "we have used non - uniform distributions of nodes similar to those described in ref.@xcite , which cover the infinite domains @xmath57 , @xmath47 as @xmath58 .",
    "we employ the inverse iteration method to obtain the eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues .",
    "this requires solving a system of linear equations with a matrix that is a finite - difference approximation to the hamiltonian .",
    "the solution of these equations is particularly simple if the matrix has a block - tridiagonal structure .",
    "the latter can be achieved using the simplest three - point approximation for the derivatives for one of the coordinates .",
    "the choice of this coordinate is dictated by obtaining a convenient form of representation for the boundary conditions .",
    "for the two other coordinates we are free to apply more precise higher order approximations to their derivatives .",
    "the final values for the energy ( and other observables ) are provided by using the richardson extrapolation technique for the corresponding results emerging from a series of geometrically similar meshes with different number of nodes . using this approach we achieve a major increase of the numerical precision and ,",
    "in particular , we obtain together with each numerical value a reliable estimate of its precision@xcite .",
    "typically , meshes used in the present calculations range from ( the sparsest ) mesh with @xmath59 nodes to ( the thickest ) one with @xmath60 nodes , i.e. 38 nodes in each direction .",
    "our results for the energies of the ground state of the two - dimensional @xmath0 center are presented in table [ tab : grcon ] .",
    "this table contains also the corresponding energies for the ground state of the @xmath5 center and a comparison with the best results obtained in the literature @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite are variational and ref.@xcite represent monte - carlo simulations .",
    "one can see , that the variational results by larsen and mccann coincide for weak and intermediate field strengths @xcite very well with our results .",
    "in contrast to this the results obtained by louie and tao pang@xcite differ significantly from these values .",
    "the absence of any approximations in our approach and the possibility to reliably evaluate the convergence of our results allow us to conclude , that the results obtained in ref.@xcite overestimate the true values for the binding energy of the ground state of the two - dimensional negative donor considerably .",
    "( the reader should note that all digits of the values for our calculated energies given in table [ tab : grcon ] are converged i.e. coincide with the exact results ) .",
    "this resolves the discrepancy on the ground state energy of the negative donor present in the literature as demonstrated by the results contained in table [ tab : grcon ] particularly for @xmath61 but also for nonvanishing field strengths .",

    "< , < \" , ]     [ tab : grcon2 ]    the ground state of the @xmath0 center is the only bound state for @xmath62 .",
    "we have carried out calculations for excited states of both symmetric and antisymmetric character of the spatial wavefunction with respect to the interchange of the coordinates of the electrons ( i.e. spin singlet and triplet states ) .",
    "these calculations were implemented both for @xmath44 and for @xmath63 .",
    "the latter states were investigated also by larsen and mccann@xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we confine ourselves to negative magnetic quantum numbers @xmath64 .",
    "pairs of states being different only with respect to the sign of @xmath65 possess equal binding energies within the corresponding landau zones .",
    "however , opposite to states with negative @xmath65 , states with @xmath66 do not belong to the lowest landau zone .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to focus on values @xmath67 .",
    "our calculations show that the ground state of the @xmath0 center is the only spin singlet state which is bound in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "this conclusion coincides with results obtained in ref.@xcite . on the otherhand",
    ", it follows from our calculations of the triplet states ( see table [ tab : grcon2 ] ) that there are two triplet states that become bound above some corresponding critical values for @xmath68 .",
    "these are the energetically lowest states for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath69 state becomes bound for @xmath71 ( the total energy of both @xmath72 and @xmath0 at @xmath73 is @xmath74 ) .",
    "the state with @xmath70 becomes bound for @xmath75 ( the total energy at @xmath76 is @xmath77 ) .    from table [ tab : grcon2",
    "] it is evident that the lowest state with magnetic quantum number @xmath78 is not bound for any magnetic field strength considered here and probably also for higher field strengths ( the binding energy @xmath79 is negative and its absolute value increases with increasing field strength ) .",
    "this result differs from that obtained by larsen and mccann@xcite .",
    "they received a positive binding energies for this state for sufficiently strong magnetic fields .",
    "their binding energy for @xmath80 is presented in the last row of table [ tab : grcon2 ] .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is the underestimation of the binding energy of the neutral donor in ref.@xcite as can be seen from table [ tab : grcon ] .",
    "the data of table [ tab : grcon2 ] together with our results for other excited states ( they are unbound ) allow us to conclude that the @xmath0 considered possesses only two bound excited states  possessing magnetic quantum numbers @xmath69 and @xmath70 .     depending on the magnetic field strength for the three lowest states of the two - dimensional @xmath0 center .",
    "effective atomic units are used ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    along with the total and binding energies of the two - dimensional negative donor @xmath0 we have calculated some geometrical parameters of its wavefunction that provide additional information about the system . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present the expectation value @xmath81 which characterize the extension of the spatial distribution of the electrons in the simplest and most straightforward way as a function of the field strength .",
    "first of all we observe that the electronic cloud is shrinking monotonically with increasing field strength for all bound states .",
    "this had to expected according to what we know about the behaviour of tightly bound states of few - electron system in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the difference of the behavior of @xmath82 for the ground ( @xmath44 ) and excited ( @xmath63 ) states for relatively weak magnetic fields is obvious : the ground state is bound for @xmath62 , its wave function remains localized for all values of @xmath68 , and @xmath82 possesses a finite limit for @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore it changes little for @xmath84 for the excited states @xmath82 is not bounded for @xmath83 .",
    "it changes rapidly with increasing field strength in particular in the weak magnetic field regime .",
    "therefore @xmath82 possesses finite values for excited states only due to the presence of the magnetic field . on the otherhand ,",
    "the dependencies of @xmath82 on the magnetic field strength in the high field regime are similar for all considered states since they are dominated by the diamagnetic term @xmath85 of the hamiltonian .",
    "the occurence of a small curvature in the dependence @xmath86 for @xmath69 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is due to the influence of internal binding forces of the system , which are not negligibly small compared to the magnetic forces for this range of field strengths .",
    "we have shown that the two - dimensional negative donor @xmath0 possesses three bound states ie .",
    "two bound excited states in the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "the spin singlet ground state is bound for arbitrary field strengths .",
    "our investigation of the ground state clarifies a discrepancy in the literature and confirms previous variational calculations @xcite . as a result the energy eigenvalues obtained in ref.@xcite turn out to violate the variational principle and are too low i.e. the corresponding binding energies are too large . for weak and intermediate field strength we obtain good agreement of our total and binding energies compared to those of ref.@xcite . in the high field regime , however , a significant lowering of the total energies and raising of the binding energies are obtained within the present investigation .",
    "our particular computational approach allows for an estimate of the difference of our ( up to several digits converged ) results and the exact ones which consequently allows us to draw definite conclusions on the energies and properties of the donor .",
    "a series of calculations for excited states show that two other states become bound with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "they are the lowest excited states with @xmath69 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the extension of these states decreases monotonically with increasing field strength .",
