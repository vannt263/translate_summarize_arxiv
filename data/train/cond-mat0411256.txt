    "the properties of the spin - peierls ( sp ) state in quasi - one - dimensional materials has attracted considerable attention over the last decades since its discovery in the organic compounds of the ttf and tcnq series@xcite , and more recently in the inorganic compound cugeo@xmath7@xcite . in analogy to the peierls instability in quasi - one - dimensional metals@xcite , a spin - chain undergoes a sp transition by dimerizing into an alternating pattern of weak and strong bonds  @xcite with the magnetic energy gain compensating the energy loss from the lattice deformation .",
    "although this physical picture gives a good qualitative understanding of the sp phenomenon , the real sp transition is in fact much more complicated to describe . in particular , the above picture of sp transition is only valid in the adiabatic regime in which the frequency of the phonons is negligible compared to the magnetic energy scales in the system , such as the spin gap or the exchange interaction @xmath8 .",
    "the validity of this approximation is clearly dependent on the system at hand .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the difference between cugeo@xmath7 and the other sp compounds consists in the high energy of the optical phonons involved in the transition , which is of the order of the exchange integral @xmath8@xcite ) .",
    "another feature that distinguishes cugeo@xmath7 from the other organic sp compounds is that no softening of the phonon modes is observed near the transition .",
    "all these findings stem for the fact that an adiabatic treatment of the phonon subsystem@xcite is inadequate to describe the sp transition in cugeo@xmath7 and an appropriate treatment of phonons in the antiadiabatic regime is required@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , not many analytical methods to study the system of coupled spin and phonons in the full frequency range are available .",
    "the main difficulty relies in the fact that when the phonon frequency becomes comparable to the energy gap in the spin - excitation spectrum , one is entering a quantum regime in which quantum fluctuations completely impregnate the ground state .",
    "this is why many of the known studies involving dynamical phonons rely on numerical methods such as exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite , strong coupling expansions@xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations@xcite . from the analytical point of view",
    "various approaches have been developed , but they work well either in adiabatic or in the antiadiabatic regime . in the former case , most approaches are based on the mean - field approximation@xcite . in the latter case",
    "various perturbation studies were performed to derive an effective spin hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "another approach was developed , based on integrating out the phonon modes@xcite in order to map the model onto the gross - neveu model@xcite for which various exact results are available@xcite .",
    "other approaches are based on the flow - equation method@xcite that works well in the antiadiabatic regime , or on the unitary transformation method for the xy spin chain@xcite .",
    "since various compounds are rather close to the border between the two regimes@xcite , it would be thus highly desirable to have a good method to tackle the adiabatic - antiadiabatic crossover . in this paper",
    "we provide such a method .",
    "we combine the renormalization group ( rg ) method and the self - consistent - harmonic - approximation ( scha ) to study the adiabatic - antiadiabatic crossover in a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain coupled to dynamical phonons . a previous attempt to use the rg to study",
    "this adiabatic - antiadiabatic crossover has been published@xcite .",
    "we will comment on the differences of the two approaches .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model of spin chain coupled to dynamical phonons , and write it in the continuum limit using the bosonization representation . in section  [ sec : scha ]",
    "we describe a variational approach , inspired from the self consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) , and use it to describe the crossover . in the adiabatic regime we find an expression for the spin - peierls gap consistent with the mean - field treatment of cross and fisher@xcite . in the antiadiabatic regime",
    "the gap is essentially described by a sine - gordon model . in section  [ sec : rg ]",
    "we study the crossover using a renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "the rg is specially well adapted around the heisenberg isotropic point .",
    "this allows to extract the phase diagram as a function of the strength of the electron - phonon coupling and the phonon frequency . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the findings of the two methods , both relative to each other and in connection with experiments .",
    "conclusions can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , and some technical details have been put in the appendices .",
    "as a simple model which describes a sp system in the following we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain coupled to a set of einstein oscillators , @xmath9 with @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are spin 1/2 operators , @xmath12 , @xmath13=i\\delta_{n , n'}$ ] . the quantity",
    "@xmath14 is the stiffness of the einstein phonon .",
    "the interaction of spins with phonons can be modeled by : @xmath15 the coupling to optical phonons described by ( [ hsp ] ) is adequate for the cugeo@xmath7 since it would correspond to a side group effect by germanium atoms as discussed in refs .  .",
    "acoustic phonons could of course be treated in a very similar way , but one would have to replace @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "note that some authors@xcite prefer to diagonalize the phonon hamiltonian in ( [ hshp ] ) using the boson operator @xmath18 , and write the interaction @xmath19 .",
    "it is obvious that one has @xmath20 .",
    "this remark will be useful when we will compare the results of the different approaches .",
    "the adiabatic limit is @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 fixed . in that limit , the phonons become classical , i.e. the @xmath16 s commute with the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and one can simply minimize the ground state energy with respect to their expectation value . in that limit ,",
    "the results of ref .   are recovered .",
    "the opposite antiadiabatic limit is @xmath24 . in that limit",
    ", one can integrate out the phonons , and one is left with the hamiltonian of a frustrated spin 1/2 chain @xcite . for a frustration large enough@xcite i.e. for large enough spin - phonon coupling , a spontaneous dimerization of the spins takes place , and the system presents a spin gap . our purpose is to provide a unified treatment of these two limits .    to solve the spin - phonon problem , we use first the well - known jordan - wigner transformation to express the spin - operators in terms of spinless fermions .",
    "thus the hamiltonian @xmath25 becomes : @xmath26 + \\\\",
    "v \\sum_n ( c^\\dagger_{n+1}c_{n+1}-\\frac12)(c^\\dagger_{n}c_{n}-\\frac 1 2),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the spin - phonon hamiltonian @xmath29 is transformed into : @xmath30\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we now proceed in the standard way to take the continuum limit ( see e.g. ref .",
    "6 ) . in the continuous approximation , ( [ hspferm ] ) generates a coupling between the lattice deformation ( phonon mode ) and the @xmath31 component of the charge density , @xmath32 .    in order to get a continuous description we separate fast and slow components of the phonon field and similarly for the fermion fields",
    ", so we get the interaction@xcite @xmath33.\\ ] ] we now use the boson representation of one dimensional fermion operators . in this representation",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath34 becomes @xmath35 where the field @xmath36 is related to the density of fermions@xcite and @xmath37=i\\delta(x - x')$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the lattice spacing , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and we have kept only the most relevant terms . changing the parameter @xmath42 allows one to explore the more general case of xxz spin chains with an easy plane anisotropy@xcite .",
    "the long wavelength part of the fermion density is @xmath43 whereas the higher fourier components are@xcite @xmath44 where we have specialized to an isotropic spin chain .",
    "the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : umklapp ] ) has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to yield a good agreement of the gap calculated within bosonization and numerical calculations@xcite .",
    "the matsubara action for the phonon field has a standard quadratic form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass density of the optical phonon mode , and @xmath47 is the lattice deformation field .",
    "in the first approximation ( [ hshp ] ) we have neglected the fact that the phonon disperses . it can be shown that the dispersion along the chain leads to insignificant corrections .",
    "on the contrary if the phonons are three dimensional , i.e. if @xmath48 disperses with the transverse momentum then significant changes can occur . indeed in that case , since the phonon are three dimensional they couple the different spin chains and can induce a three dimensional transition at low temperatures .",
    "we will come back to the case of three dimensional phonons in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "since the total action is quadratic in the phonon fields , we can integrate them out to obtain the following bosonized action with a retarded interaction between the electronic densities :    @xmath49 -\\frac{g^2}{2 ( \\pi \\alpha)^2 \\rho \\omega_0 ^ 2 } \\int    dx \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau ' \\cos 2 \\phi(x,\\tau ) { \\cal d}_{\\omega_0,\\beta}(\\tau-\\tau ' ) \\cos 2    \\phi(x,\\tau'),\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the propagator of an einstein phonon of frequency @xmath0 corresponding to the action ( [ sph ] ) @xmath51.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) fully describes a one dimensional spin chain coupled to phonons , and does not rely on adiabatic or antiadiabatic limit .",
    "however , one has to note that because of the cutoff , the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) is valid only for @xmath52 . for higher value of the phonon frequency @xmath0",
    ", the phonon propagator ( [ eq : phonon - propagator ] ) must be replaced with @xmath53 . in that case",
    "the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) is simply the continuum action of a frustrated spin chain@xcite , in agreement with the canonical transformation approach@xcite .",
    "the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) is of course impossible to solve exactly . in order to obtain the physical properties of the system we will analyze it using two different techniques in the next sections .",
    "the first technique is a self consistent approximation .",
    "such an approximation , will be very useful to define the various phases of the system as well as the relevant parameters . as any variational approximation , although it can be very efficient in describing the various phases it can only describe the transitions between these phases approximately .",
    "so in order to study the critical points we use a renormalization group method , building on the knowledge of the relevant parameters extracted from the scha .",
    "to study the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) we apply first the self consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) or gaussian variational method@xcite .",
    "the idea is that the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) would be classically minimized by @xmath54 .",
    "one can thus expect that the physics will be dominated by small deviations around this minimum and approximate the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) by a quadratic action .",
    "we thus consider as a trial action @xmath55 we have to find the propagator @xmath56 so that ( [ eq : variatac ] ) is the best approximation for ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) .",
    "for that we define the variational free energy @xmath57 where : @xmath58},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 represents an average with respect to the action @xmath60 .    the second term in the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] )",
    "can be rewritten as    @xmath61.\\ ] ]    given that the phonon propagator ( [ eq : phonon - propagator ] ) decays for large time difference ( @xmath62 ) , one can see from ( [ eq : equasplit ] ) that the cosine of the sum is roughly equivalent to @xmath63 and can be responsible for the opening of a gap in the spectrum , while the cosine of the difference is @xmath64 and thus will modify the quadratic part of the action .    in the following we consider the gapless ( @xmath65 ) and the gapful ( @xmath66 ) case separately , at zero temperature .",
    "the gapless case is interesting in connection with systems of electrons at an incommensurate filling interacting with phonons@xcite . in these systems",
    ", the term @xmath67 $ ] does not appear in ( [ eq : equasplit ] ) , leading to @xmath65 .",
    "the spin - peierls problem corresponds to the half - filling case for the fermions .",
    "using ( [ eq : variatac ] ) the variational free energy is given by :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and we used ( [ eq : phonon - propagator ] ) for @xmath70 . introducing the propagator for the field @xmath71 , @xmath72 , we can rewrite : @xmath73 using this expression we obtain :    @xmath74    minimizing the action ( [ eq : varia - g ] ) with respect to @xmath75 and using the fact that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the self - energy , we get :    @xmath78    as is obvious from the above equation , the low frequency behavior of @xmath75 is similar to the one of @xmath79 , and corresponds to a variational action of the form @xmath80,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath81 . in the equation above we thus have : @xmath82 where @xmath83 , is a frequency cutoff . using ( [ eq : intg ] )",
    "we can write our variational equation as : @xmath84 if we confine to an expansion up to order @xmath85 in @xmath86 , as requested by the analytical behavior of the green s function for @xmath87 , we obtain : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the gamma function . as we see the integral",
    "is convergent when @xmath90 .",
    "going back to the definition of the self - energy we have : @xmath91 equating ( [ eq : sigma_exp ] ) with ( [ eq : sigma_om ] ) , and using the fact that @xmath92 , we obtain the following value of the parameter @xmath42 : @xmath93 expanding around @xmath42 , we obtain the renormalized value of @xmath94 : @xmath95 one thus recovers a luttinger liquid but with a renormalized value of the luttinger parameter @xmath42 .",
    "( [ eq : k_ren_pert ] ) implies that @xmath96 . a similar result can be obtained via the renormalization group analysis ( see the next section ) . in a rg analysis the result ( [ eq : k_ren_pert ] ) would correspond to integrating the rg equation for the coupling constant @xmath97 assuming that @xmath42 is not renormalized and then computing the lowest order correction to @xmath42 with the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "our method thus reproduces in a crude way the renormalization of @xmath42 downwards . as in ref .",
    ", we find that the tendency of the system to form charge density waves is increased",
    ".      in the commensurate case the derivation of the variational free energy from ( [ eq : free - variational]-[eq : varia - der ] ) remains the same in the commensurate case .",
    "let s rewrite ( [ eq : varia - g ] ) in slightly different way :    @xmath98    minimizing this action with respect to @xmath75 we obtain the following expression for the self - energy : @xmath99    as is obvious from the above equation ( [ eq : sigma_var_comm ] ) , @xmath100 is in fact independent of @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , we can use the following expansion for the self - energy : @xmath102 in eq .",

    "as we have discussed in the previous section , the scha describes only approximately the renormalization of the quadratic part by the phonon coupling term .",
    "such a renormalization of the parameter @xmath42 is of course specially crucial to take into account precisely close the isotropic heisenberg point @xmath153 . in this section",

    "attempts to an rg analysis of such a problem or of directly related fermionic problems have been described in the literature . in particular",

    ", the interaction of the spinful fermions with the electrons is viewed as a retarded backscattering interaction . however , although this description is appropriate for fermions , in the case of the spin chain it neglects the fact that the staggered dimer operator gives rise to more relevant interactions than current - current ones . as a result , this fermionic description underestimates the size of the dimerization gap .",
    "our analysis , directly based on the boson representation of the spin chain does not suffer from such a limitation .",
    "in addition to providing us with a better description of the dimerization gap , the use of the boson representation also allows us to tackle the case of a finite frequency @xmath0 and nonzero temperature .",

    "second it gives us that the proper dimensionless coupling constant measuring the strength of the electron - phonon interaction is : @xmath162 we now proceed with the rg .",

    ", we find no corrections to the phonon frequency as can be seen in ( [ rgomega0 ] ) .",
    "however , we expect such corrections to be obtained in a higher loop order calculation .      since the action ( [ eq : finite - freq ] ) also describes spinless fermions coupled to phonons , our equations have similarities with the rg equations that have been derived for the electron phonon problem@xcite .",
    "there are however important differences .",
    "first for a spin chain the equivalent fermionic band is automatically half - filled ( in the absence of an external magnetic field ) .",
    "thus in addition to the standard terms that were considered for the electron - phonon problem with incommensurate filling , one has here to take into account the marginal umklapp operator @xmath164 as in ref .  .",
    "second , in the electron - phonon problem a different coupling constant is used@xcite , namely @xmath167 .",
    "such definition appears natural when looking at the rg equations ( [ rgk ] ) and ( [ rgdelta ] ) since @xmath168 seems to be the amount by which @xmath42 is renormalized in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "however , such definition would be at odds with the calculations performed with the scha .",
    "in fact , the integral @xmath169 for all @xmath0 . as a result , if we neglect @xmath170 in ( [ rgk ] ) , and the renormalization of @xmath42 in ( [ rggsp ] ) , we find the following approximate rg equation for @xmath166 and @xmath42 : @xmath171 and by a variable change to @xmath172 , we easily obtain that @xmath173 this equation is easily understood : @xmath0 gives an energy cutoff that stops the rg flow of @xmath42 induced by @xmath166 at an energy scale of order @xmath174 .",
