    "one of the most interesting questions in modern astrophysics concerns the formation of structures in the early universe .",
    "the most luminous high redshift radio galaxies are unique probes of galaxy and cluster formation : they are amongst the oldest and most massive objects in the early universe and there is considerable evidence that they are at the centers of proto clusters . here we present results of a search for emission line galaxies in the field around the radio source 1138 - 262 at z=2.2 . based on the success of this project , we are now conducting a large program on the vlt to detect and study clusters around a few selected high redshift radio galaxies , over a redshift range from 2 to 4 , which is presented by kurk et al . in this proceedings .",
    "we have initially selected the radio galaxy mrc 1138 - 262 at z=2.156 as our best field to search for companion galaxies , since there are many observations indicating that it is probably a forming massive galaxy at the center of a dense region . these include : its extremely clumpy optical and near - ir morphology , similar to that predicted by simulations of forming massive galaxies ( pentericci et al 1998 ) ; the extremely distorted radio source , with evidence of interaction with the dense surrounding gas ; the extreme faraday rotation of 6600 rad m@xmath1 , the largest amongst all high redshift radio galaxies known ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicating the presence of dense magnetized gas on large scales ; and the luminous ly@xmath0 halo , extending for more than 200 kpc ( kurk et al . 2001 ) . + initial vlt narrow band imaging centered on the redshifted ly@xmath0  line revealed the presence of @xmath2 50 candidate ly@xmath0  emitters , with restframe equivalent width larger than 20   ( kurk et al .",
    "follow - up multi object spectroscopy has revealed 14 galaxies and 1 faint qso , at approximately the same distance as the radio galaxy , and at least 4 other objects with spectral energy distribution consistent with them being at @xmath3 ( pentericci et al .",
    "all the ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies , with the exception of the faint qso , have redshift in the range 2.16@xmath40.02 and are within a projected physical distance of less than 0.75 h@xmath5 mpc from the radio source ( q@xmath6 ) .",
    "there is no is no clear enhancement of ly@xmath0  emitters toward the radio galaxy , although the distribution of most of the emitters seems to be elongated in the direction of the radio source ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution suggests that there are two galaxy subgroups , having velocity dispersions of 280 and 500 km s@xmath7 respectively and a relative velocity of 1800 km s@xmath7 ( see figure 1 in kurk et al .",
    "this proceedings ) + assuming an isothermal sphere model , the mass contained inside a 0.75h@xmath7 mpc radius , is respectively 0.3 @xmath8 10@xmath9h@xmath5 and 0.9 @xmath8 10@xmath9 h@xmath5 m@xmath10 , which implies a total mass in excess of 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 for the whole system .",
    "prompted by the success of our optical narrow band search , we also obtained near infrared deep images of the 1138 - 262 field , with isaac , using a narrow band filter centered around 2.07@xmath11 m which encompasses h@xmath0  emission from galaxies at a redshift around 2.15 .",
    "since h@xmath0  emission is not as sensitive to dust extinction as ly@xmath0  these observations are mainly sensitive to dusty galaxies .",
    "+ two isaac fields were observed , both inside the fors field : one centered around the radio galaxy and one north east of this , covering 6 confirmed ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "the observations were also complemented by broad band near infrared images , in k band for the eastern field and in j - h - k band for the central field + candidate line emitting objects were then selected on the basis of their excess narrow versus broad band flux .",
    "we have selected objects with restframe equivalent width ew@xmath12 @xmath13 50   and @xmath14 @xmath13 3 , where @xmath14 is the excess signal in the narrow band compared with the noise in both narrow and broad band , as defined in bunker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . as a result",
    "we detect 17 candidates h@xmath0  emitters in the central field and only 6 in the ne field , with one in common between the two fields ( figure 1 ) .",
    "2.4 cm    we will assume that the line detected is h@xmath0 .",
    "other possibilities that can not be excluded , although less likely , include fainter lines from higher redshift objects , such as [ oii](3727  ) from z=4.6 galaxies or [ oiii](5007  ) from z=3.2 galaxies , and p@xmath0 ( at 1.88@xmath11 m ) from z=0.12 galaxies .",
    "confirmation of the real redshift is one of the aims of the planned follow - up spectroscopy that will be carried out next march with isaac .",
    "+ the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 emitters is clearly not homogeneous over the two fields but rather confined to the central parts where there are 3 times as many candidates as in the outer region .",
    "moreover in the central field the emitters seem to be oriented in a similar direction as the radio source and the ionized gas halo that surrounds the galaxy .",
    "this is clearly different from the ly@xmath0  emitters that show no clustering on this scale .",
    "the population of h@xmath0 emitters could just be a dusty version of the ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "both ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0  are produced by recombination of ionized hydrogen and are indicators of star formation rate . however , since ly@xmath0  is a resonant line , ly@xmath0  photons will be scattered by neutral hydrogen : if there is also dust present in such a region , most ly@xmath0  photons will be absorbed before they can escape . therefore , ly@xmath0  emission can only be observed from galaxies with a low or very patchy dust content .",
    "this is not the case for h@xmath0  radiation which is less susceptible to dust .",
    "hence , with an h@xmath0  survey we also target those galaxies with high star formation accompanied by larger amounts of dust . +",
    "an indication that this is indeed the case comes from the ratio of sfr derived from h@xmath0  emission , and from the uv continuum . in figure 2 we present such quantities for all the h@xmath0  emitters :",
    "the sfrs have been derived according to the prescription of kennicutt ( 1998 ) , and in particular for the line emission we used sfr(m@xmath15/yr ) = 7.9@xmath810@xmath16 l(h@xmath0  ) ( erg s@xmath7 ) , which is appropriate for continuous star formation , and for the uv restframe continuum we used sfr(m@xmath15/yr ) = 1.4@xmath810@xmath17 l(1500 - 2800)(erg s@xmath7 hz@xmath7 ) .",
    "the ratio of the two quantities is around one or larger in almost all cases , with the exception of the brighter 2 - 3 objects which might as well be lower redshift interlopers .",
    "however if the dust content was the only difference between the ly@xmath0  and the h@xmath0  emitters , we would not expect a different distribution between the two populations .",
    "possible explanations could then be a difference in age and/or metal content .",
    "we are still investigating this issue : preliminary results from the broad band photometry seem to indicate no differences between the two populations , both having spectral energy distributions consistent with young starburst galaxies .",
    "the mean rest frame ew@xmath12 for the ly@xmath0 emitters is 60   and the distribution is nearly uniform from 15 to 150  .",
    "there are several objects with ew in excess of 100  .",
    "this is significantly different from what is obtained by steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a large sample of galaxies at redshift around 3 : they find no galaxies with ew@xmath12 larger than 100  .",
    "the same considerations can be made for the h@xmath0  emitters which have very high restframe ew@xmath12 . while our results are most probably due to our observational strategy , that emphasizes large ew@xmath12 objects , it is also possible that some of our cluster galaxies , besides the faint qso , contain an agn contribution , since photoionization from hot stars is unlikely to produce such large ew@xmath12 as observed ( e.g.  charlot & fall 1993 ) .",
    "an enhanced agn content for the cluster , is also indicated by the detection of several other faint x - ray emitters in the field ( from chandra observations , carilli et al 2001 ) , of which one coincides with the qso , and two others with candidate line emitters .",
