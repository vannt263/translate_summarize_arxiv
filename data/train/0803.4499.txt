    "magnetic fields permeate the universe .",
    "if kinetic effects such as hall current , ambipolar drift of anisotropic pressure tensor , may be prevalent at small scales , the large - scales can be described in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation .",
    "for example , electric fields and ionospheric currents play a dynamic role in the evolution of the atmosphere above 100 km , and the input of energy from the magnetosphere during magnetic storms can affect the thermosphere and ionosphere on global scales .",
    "mhd has many similarities with navier  stokes ( ns ) turbulence : recall the batchelor analogy between vorticity and induction , both undergoing stretching through velocity gradients ( see equation ( [ mhd_eq ] ) ) . on that basis , one can conjecture that the energy spectrum will be of the kolmogorov type , as in fact observed in numerical simulations of a decaying flow ( @xcite and references therein ) , as well as in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "however , iroshinkov and kraichnan ( ik hereafter ) hypothesized that the slowing - down of nonlinear transfer by alfvn waves would alter the energy spectrum @xcite , predicting a spectrum @xmath0 , as recently observed in numerical simulations @xcite and in solar wind observations @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian renormalized approximation also gives spectra compatible with the ik model @xcite .",
    "these spectra are isotropic , but the presence of a strong quasi - uniform magnetic field @xmath1 at large scale renders the dynamic anisotropic .",
    "one can compute exactly the reduced dynamics in that case @xcite , using weak turbulence theory ; the emerging energy spectrum @xmath2 , where @xmath3 refers to wavevectors perpendicular to @xmath1 ( note that the isotropization of such a spectrum is compatible with the ik spectrum ) .",
    "note also that a weak turbulence spectrum was observed in the magnetosphere of jupiter @xcite , the evidence stemming from an analysis of galileo spacecraft data .",
    "a weak turbulence spectrum also obtained as well in a large numerical simulation of mhd turbulence in three dimensions @xcite at a magnetic taylor reynolds number of @xmath4 at scales smaller than where the isotropic ik spectrum is observed .",
    "both the terrestrial and jovian magnetospheric plasmas as well as the solar wind , the solar atmosphere , and the interstellar medium are highly turbulent conducting compressible flows sustaining magneto - acoustic wave propagation and a better understanding of their dynamics , leading for example to star formation , requires adequate tools for modeling them . furthermore , there is currently a surge of interest for achieving an experimental dynamo ( the growth of a seed magnetic field through fluid motions , see @xcite ) . in the case of liquid metals , or the fluid core of the earth @xcite or the solar convection zone",
    ", the magnetic prandtl number is very small ( @xmath5 or less ) ; hence , the dynamo instability occurs in a turbulent flow and modeling the turbulence in order to study this phenomenon is in order @xcite .",
    "there are few models for mhd ( see e.g. the recent review in @xcite ) , comparatively to the fluid case where the engineering community has been driving a vigorous research agenda . in that light",
    ", this paper aims at developing such a model , in the context of a spectral approach following the work of chollet and lesieur @xcite for the fluid case , using two - point closure of turbulent flows .",
    "we give the basic equations in the next section and then move on in section [ modeling ] to recall the edqnm closure formulation for mhd .",
    "new triad relaxation times are introduced in section [ deriv ] and first tested in section [ test ] .",
    "the case of a random flow for two values of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath6 are treated respectively in section [ random ] ( @xmath7 ) and section [ random2 ] ( @xmath8 ) , and the deterministic orszag - tang flow in three dimension is analyzed in section [ ot ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclu ] is the conclusion and two technical appendices ( [ appena ] and [ appenb ] ) are given at the end .",
    "let us consider the fourier transform of the velocity @xmath9 and the magnetic @xmath10 at wavevector @xmath11 : @xmath12 the mhd equations describe the time evolution of a conducting fluid velocity field coupled to a magnetic field .",
    "they derive from maxwell s equations with the assumption that velocities are sub - relativistic , hence the displacement current can be neglected @xcite . in terms of the fourier coefficients of the velocity and the magnetic components ,",
    "the mhd equations with constant unit density read : @xmath13 with @xmath14 in the incompressible case and @xmath15 indicating the lack of magnetic monopoles in the classical approximation .",
    "here , @xmath16 is the alfvn velocity , with @xmath17 the permeability , and @xmath18 the uniform density ( taken equal to unity ) ; @xmath19 is the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath20 the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are bilinear operators for energy transfer written as : @xmath23 with @xmath24 a projector that allows to take the pressure term of the velocity equation into account via the poisson formulation .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "finally note that , in the absence of dissipation ( @xmath26 ) , the total energy @xmath27 , the correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field @xmath28 and the magnetic helicity @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) are invariants of the ideal mhd equations in three dimensions .",
    "the large eddy simulation model ( les ) derived in @xcite ( paper i hereafter ) is now extended to the mhd equations in its non - helical version ( les - p ) . as a first step , a spectral filtering of the equations is realized ; this operation consists in the truncation of all veloctity and magnetic components at a wave - vector @xmath11 such that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a cut - off wavenumber . in an intermediate zone lying between @xmath32 and @xmath33 both kinetic and magnetic energy spectra",
    "are assumed to behave as power - laws followed by an exponential decrease : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are evaluated at each time step of the numerical simulations , through a mean square fit of the resolved kinetic and magnetic energy spectra . in a second step",
    "one can write the modeled mhd equations as : @xmath41 v_\\alpha(\\textbf{k},t )   & = & t_\\alpha^{v<}({\\textbf{k}},t ) \\\\ \\left[\\partial_t + \\left(\\eta\\left(k|k_c , t\\right ) + \\eta k^2\\right ) \\right ] b_\\alpha(\\textbf{k},t )   & = & t_\\alpha^{m<}({\\textbf{k}},t ) \\label{mhdmodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath42 symbol indicates that the nonlinear transfers are integrated on the truncated domain such as @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 which are respectively called eddy viscosity and magnetic eddy diffusivity are expressed as : @xmath47 ( see paper i for more details ) . here",
    "the @xmath48 terms ( see appendix a ) , correspond to the absorption terms of the eddy damped quasi normal markovian ( edqnm ) nonlinear transfer , leading in particular to turbulent eddy diffusivities ( see e.g. @xcite for the mhd case ) .",
    "@xmath49 is the integration domain on @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , triangles such as @xmath51 and or @xmath52 are larger than @xmath32 and both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "finally , to take into account the effect of the emission ( eddy - noise ) terms of the edqnm nonlinear transfer ( i.e. @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) , we use a reconstruction field procedure which also enables to partialy rebuild the phase relationships between the three spectral components of each velocity and magnetic fields , as explained in paper i @xcite .",
    "we first implemented our les model with the edqnm equations of pouquet et al @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this formulation the triad - relaxation time @xmath57 ( see appendix a ) takes three characteristic times into account :    - a ( combined ) dissipation time @xmath58 defined as : @xmath59    - a nonlinear time @xmath60 expressed as : @xmath61dq   \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , \\label{tnl_pfl}\\ ] ]    - and an alfvn time @xmath62 which reads : @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ . \\label{ta_pfl}\\ ] ]    this constitutes a straightforward generalization of the edqnm closure to the case of mhd flows ( see for example @xcite ) in which two new times , specifically the alfvn time and the diffusion time built on magnetic resistivity , are incorporated in a phenomenological manner .",
    "a comparison of a simulation using this les model ( les mhd i , or run * ii * in table  [ table1 ] ) , with a dns simulation ( run * i * in table  [ table1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ compa_evo_pfl ] ( see next section for more information on the numerical procedure ) .",
    "one sees that both the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra are overestimated by the model at scales close to the cut - off , indicative of an inadequate energy transfer in the model at these scales . when evaluating numerically the different eddy dampings using eqns .",
    "( [ td_pfl]-[ta_pfl ] ) , one observes that the alfvn time is almost one order of magnitude shorter than all other times , including the diffusion time at the smallest resolved scales ( see @xcite ) ; this leads to an insufficient damping at the scales close to the cut - off .",
    "this is in part due to the dominance of the magnetic energy at large - scale ; in that sense , it could be linked to the particular flow under study and parametric analyses of several flows will have to be performed in the future in order to fine - tune this mhd model .",
    "however , the discrepancy displayed in fig .",
    "[ compa_evo_pfl ] could also be linked to the particular expression of eddy damping chosen in @xcite .",
    "we are thus led to examine more closely the dynamics of energy transfer within the edqnm framework .    , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 from upper to lower curves for data * i * ( @xmath67 dns , solid line ) , and data * ii * ( @xmath68 les mhd i , plus symbols).,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ] , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 from upper to lower curves for data * i * ( @xmath67 dns , solid line ) , and data * ii * ( @xmath68 les mhd i , plus symbols).,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]",
    "we now analyze the precise structure of the equations leading to the edqnm closure ; this is done in appendix [ appenb ] . note that a similar but more complex and systematic approach can be found in @xcite in the context of the lagrangian renormalization approximation .",
    "our analysis results in the expression of three new eddy diffusivity times , with which one can build four different eddy - damping rates @xmath69 , namely : @xmath70 where : @xmath71 with @xmath72 based on a new alfvn - like time , namely @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    finally , from these eddy - damping rates we derive the corresponding triad - interaction times ( as defined in appendix a ) . for the edqnm kinetic energy equation ,",
    "we obtain two different @xmath74 s , @xmath75 applied to @xmath53 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 applied to @xmath54 and @xmath78 .    for the edqnm magnetic energy equation",
    "we also obtain two triad - interaction time , namely @xmath77 applied to @xmath55 and @xmath79 and @xmath80 applied to @xmath56 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that this formulation leads to distinguish between the joule and the viscous dissipation more systematically than in @xcite , and therefore to possibly better simulate flows at magnetic prandtl numbers different from unity .",
    "another difference is the special treatment of the lorentz force in the velocity equation .",
    "we call les mhd ii the model that takes these new triad - relaxation times into account .",
    "in order to assess the ability of the model to reproduce the physics involved in mhd flows , we performed direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the three - dimensional mhd equations , at a resolution of @xmath67 grid points , together with computations based on our les mhd formulation , but now using @xmath68 grid points .",
    "we performed this comparative study from three different simulations of freely decaying mhd flows . to test our model in a simple configuration ,",
    "we first run a simulation at @xmath7 with random initial conditions and no correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field ( run * i * for the dns , run * ii * for the les mhd i , and run * iii * for the les mhd ii , in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "since the new eddy - damping times we derived allow for a clear distinction between the kinematic viscosity and the magnetic dissipation , we then simulated a flow with identical initial conditions but with now @xmath8 ( run * iv * for the dns , and run * v * for the les mhd ii in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we recall that , in the work of @xcite , the edqnm closure has been derived for the case when the cross - correlation ( or cross - helicity ) spectrum @xmath82 is assumed to be identically zero in the presence of helicity ( see @xcite for the non helical case in the presence of velocity - magnetic field correlation ) .",
    "however , for many flows , this quantity is non negligible ; furthermore , it can be strong locally ( in particular in the vicinity of vorticity and current sheets ) even when the global correlation is close to zero @xcite .",
    "we thus performed as well a simulation at @xmath7 for which the velocity and the magnetic field are significantly correlated , in order to see how our model may adapt to such a situation .",
    "we chose the so - called three - dimensional orszag - tang flow ( run * vi * for the dns , and run * vii * for the les mhd ii in table  [ table1 ] ) for which initially @xmath83 .    from all these simulations , we studied global flow quantities such as the total , kinetic and magnetic energies , as well as helicities , and the cross - correlation energy .",
    "we also analyzed the spectral behaviors of these quantities .",

    "this is due to the fact that les mhd i and dns spectra cross at a wavenumber located inside these ranges .",
    "finally , at small scales , the les mhd ii data lead to a much better approximation than the les mhd i data . at different times , the comparison between les mhd i and les mhd ii results leads to similar results ( not shown ) .",

    "this change alone , from a traditional hydrodynamic edqnm closure , led to energy spectra that differ from the kolmogorov case , with a @xmath142 law in the uncorrelated case , and with a @xmath143 in the correlated case @xcite , with @xmath144 ; here , @xmath145 are the energy spectra of the elssser variables @xmath146 .    however , when examining the succession of equations for the higher - order moments , and keeping the total correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field equal to zero to simplify the algebra , a more complex structure emerges , which may help the modeling of the mhd dynamics to be closer to the dns than the results shown in fig.[compa_evo_pfl ] .",
    "there are in fact four groups of terms in the closure equations .",
    "the first group corresponds to the pure fluid case and can be written symbolically as : @xmath147 this leads , as usual , to two characteristic times written here as : @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the second group writes symbolically again as : @xmath150 @xmath151 here , two new times can be extracted , namely a dissipative time @xmath152  , and @xmath153 , a modified alfvn time .",
    "the third group of closure terms is of the following type : @xmath154 @xmath155 and finally the fourth group : @xmath156 @xmath155 again , the following new characteristic dissipative times can be a priori deduced from these two groups ( with similar nomenclatures as before ) : @xmath157 , and @xmath158 .    in conclusion ,",
    "a careful examination of the cumulant equations has led to the adjunction of several new times , distinguishing between magnetic and kinetic energy transfer as well as the different quantities entering the transfer terms .",
    "note that the new modified alfvn time is finally expressed as : @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ .\\ ] ] it incorporates the lack of equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energy that is often observed , and this for example should also alter the dynamics , in the early ( kinematic ) phase of the dynamo problem .",
    "the non - linear time has the classical expression built only on the velocity field : @xmath159^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ .\\ ] ] finally , we numerically estimated the value of the alfvn time constant @xmath160 .",
    "this point will need further study as we extend the number of flows that are tested with this les .",
    "the constant @xmath127 is determined through the relation [ [ lambda ] ] in appendix a. the model has thus two open parameters that can be evaluated once the constants appearing in front of the energy spectra in mhd are determined .    also note that the way the dissipation coefficients are taken into account may well affect the results when the magnetic prandtl number differs substantially from unity unless possibly when both the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers are very large because of the effect of renormalisation of transport coefficients @xcite .    similarly to equation ( [ pfl_rate ] ) for the eddy damping rate in @xcite",
