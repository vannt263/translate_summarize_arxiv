    "the vla and the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) array images show a diffuse snr shell with a flat spectrum core @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations with asca revealed the thermal and non - thermal spectral components of kes  75 @xcite .",
    "a 37ks chandra exposure resolved the shell structure and discovered a neutron star embedded in an axisymmetric pwn with complex morphology @xcite .",
    "the observation also indicated a remarkable coincidence between the x - ray and radio emission . comparing spitzer infrared images to deep chandra observations ,",
    "@xcite suggested a wolf - rayet progenitor for the remnant . at higher energy ,",
    "the pwn has been detected in soft @xmath3-rays by integral @xcite and in the tev band by hess @xcite .",
    "the first distance estimate to the source placed it at 19kpc based on neutral hydrogen absorption measurements @xcite , implying very high efficiency with which the pulsar converts its spin - down power into x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite deduced a new distance estimate of 5.1 - 7.5kpc from hi and @xmath4co maps , providing a more reasonable pulsar luminosity and remnant size .",
    "the pulsar j18460258 was discovered in the x - ray band with timing observations using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite , but remains undetected at radio frequencies @xcite . the spin period ( @xmath5ms ) and spin down rate ( @xmath6ss@xmath7 )",
    "imply a large spin - down luminosity of @xmath8ergss@xmath9ergss@xmath7 , a high surface magnetic strength @xmath10g@xmath11 g , and a small characteristic age @xmath12yr .",
    "the large inferred surface magnetic field is near the values found for pulsars whose emission is magnetically dominated , i.e.the magnetars @xcite .",
    "subsequent rxte monitoring observations indicated a braking index of @xmath13 @xcite , implying a spin - down age @xmath14yr , which makes it one of the youngest known neutron star in our galaxy ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently reported 5 short x - ray bursts from the pulsar in 2006 , along with temporary changes in the spectral and timing noise properties , suggesting magnetar - like nature of this object . coincidentally , the deep chandra observation presented in this study was taken only 7 days after these unprecedented bursts . with the same dataset , @xcite independently reported the increase in the pulsar flux and the softening in its spectrum at this time , as a result of the bursts .",
    "we note that the above studies focused on the central pulsar and left unresolved the question of variability in the pwn .    in this paper , we concentrate on the spatial and spectral properties of the pwn in kes 75 using deep chandra observations .",
    "specifically , we investigate the variability in the system by comparing exposures from different epochs .",
    "this analysis provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of a young pwn and its interaction with the environment .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  [ s2 ] . in  [ s3 ] , we present the spatial analysis of the overall pwn structure .",
    "the variabilities of the pulsar and the pwn are studied in  [ s4 ] .",
    "the spectral analysis is presented in  [ s5 ] and in  [ s6 ]",
    "we discuss the interpretations of all the above results .",
    "deep chandra observations of kes 75 were carried out on jun 5 - 12 , 2006 in four exposures ( observation ids [ obsids ] , , & ) which began 7 days after the first four bursts that were reported by @xcite , and 50 days before the fifth one .",
    "the data were taken with the acis - s array operating in very faint ( vf ) timed exposure imaging mode using a custom ccd subarray of 600 rows ( frame time=1.8s ) in order to reduce the photon pile - up . the total exposure was 155ks and the pulsar was positioned near the aim point on the s3 chip , which was the only ccd active during the observation . for comparison , we have also reprocessed the archival 37ks exposure ( ) observed on oct 15 , 2000 @xcite , which was carried out in acis - s faint te mode with the full ccd frame ( frame time = 3.2s ) .",
    "all data reduction was performed using ciao 4.0 and caldb 3.4.2 .",
    "we started with the level=1 event files , turned off the pixel randomization , and applied the time - dependent gain calibration and charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction .",
    "we did not apply the background cleaning algorithm for the vf observations , which uses the outer 16 pixels of the @xmath15 event island to improve discrimination between good events and likely cosmic rays , since this rejects too many real events from the bright source .",
    "examination of the background light curves showed no strong flares during all the observations .",
    "hence , all data are included in the analysis . for imaging analysis ,",
    "the four individual exposures of the 2006 observation were co - added .",
    "we first determined the pulsar position with the task wavdetect , then aligned the images accordingly . assuming the roll angle in the header is correct , we applied only linear shifts for the alignment .",
    "since the amount of shift required is at most 0.5 pixels ( i.e.  @xmath16 ) , which is much smaller than the features we are interested in , the error introduced in the process is negligible . for spectral analysis ,",
    "spectra were extracted from each individual exposure separately , then a joint fit was performed .",
    "fig .  [ f1 ] shows the complex morphology of the pwn . as reported previously by @xcite , the @xmath17 diameter overall structure",
    "is filled with diffuse emission and elongated in the northwest - southeast direction with an obvious symmetry axis .",
    "the nebula has a sharp edge in the southeast , but a more diffuse boundary in the north with finger - like protrusions .",
    "the pwn shows small - scale features that resemble those of the crab nebula @xcite , including bays in the east and west , and a chimney in north . at the center of the pwn",
    ", a bright point source at the pulsar position is embedded in a compact nebula and has a one - sided collimated jet - like feature extending @xmath18 to the southwest along the nebula axis .",
    "this ` inner jet ' then fades and connects to a broader ` outer jet ' before it terminates at a clump @xmath19 southwest of the pulsar .",
    "the whole pwn is also cutoff sharply at that point . in the northeast",
    ", there is another bright clump about @xmath20 aligned with the jet direction . at the base of this northern clump ,",
    "an arc - like feature , which runs across the entire nebula , is bisected by the jet .",
    "[ f1]c illustrates all these features and the count profiles of the pwn along different regions are plotted in fig .",
    "in particular , the peaks in fig .",
    "[ f2]a & [ f2]c clearly indicate the arc - like feature .",
    "highly collimated polar jets and equatorial outflows such as tori or wisps in x - ray are commonly found features among young pwn systems ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations show that a latitude - dependent pulsar wind can lead to doppler - boosted arcs and jets in the x - ray synchrotron emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "employing a simple model to capture these characteristic features , @xcite demonstrate a robust way to measure the underlying pwn geometry .",
    "for the pwn in kes  75 , the highly collimated jet - like feature and its alignment with the nebula symmetry axis strongly suggest its connection to the pulsar polar outflow . in this scenario ,",
    "the arc - like feature perpendicular to the jet could be part of a doppler boosted torus or wisp in the equatorial plane .",
    "we have applied the pulsar wind torus fitting scheme described by @xcite to model the geometry of these features .",
    "our model consists of a point source , a torus and three gaussian ellipses that represent the compact diffuse nebula surrounding the pulsar , and the jets and clumps on both sides .",
    "an energy weighted point spread function ( psf ) , which is simulated with the chandra ray tracer ( chart ) and marx software packages using the source spectrum , was used in the fitting .",
    "the psf also includes the ccd readout trail and the pile - up effects .",
    "the ellipses are fixed in size and oriented along the torus symmetry axis , while their intensity and separation are determined by the fit .",
    "additional model parameters include the torus axis position angle @xmath21 ( from north to east ) , inclination angle @xmath22 between the torus axis and the observer line of sight , radius @xmath23 , blur @xmath24 for the torus profile , post - shock flow velocity @xmath25 , and the intensity of the point source .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined by maximizing a poisson - based likelihood function .",
    "more details on the modeling and fitting can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that we performed the fit to the 2006 epoch only , in order to avoid any complication from different psfs and instrumental response between observations .",
    "[ f3 ] shows the best - fit model compared to the data , with the corresponding parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we found that the uncertainties in the fit are dominated by the systematic errors , while the statistical errors are negligible since the source is bright and the deep exposure provides a high signal - to - noise ratio image .",
    "it is obvious that our simple model captures only the characteristic features of the pwn , hence the unmodeled structure contributes to the systematic uncertainties . following @xcite , we attempted to quantify this term by blanking out the jet regions in the fit ( the dotted ellipses in fig .",
    "in addition , we also tried fitting only part of the arc by excising the sectors in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , one at a time .",
    "the change in the parameters indicates how sensitively the results depend on a particular region , therefore providing an estimate of the systematic errors in the fit which are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . at a distance of 6kpc",
    ", the best - fit radius of the arc has a de - projected physical size of 0.3pc , which falls between values for the inner and outer tori of the crab pulsar @xcite , is a reasonable value for a young pwn .",
    "the fitting results also indicate a substantial flux contribution from the compact nebula , and that the northern clump is brighter than the southern one .",
    "given the inclination of the pulsar spin axis determined by the fit , a simple picture of doppler boosted jets predicts the southern clump to be brighter than the northern one , which is clearly inconsistent with the results .",
    "the 2006 exposure was started 7 days after the first burst reported by @xcite and no bursts have occurred during the observation . the pulsar lightcurve shows no short - term variability in and between the four individual exposures . on the other hand , a comparison to the 2000 exposure reveals a drastic increase in the pulsar flux .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the exposure corrected images of the pwn for the two observations . in the second epoch ,",
    "the pulsar is so bright that the ccd pile - up severely complicates the count rate measurement .",
    "therefore we estimated the flux from the ccd readout trail which is due to the ` out - of - time images ' during the @xmath26s frame transfer time from one row to another .",
    "we employed a rectangular region of 3  width centered on the trail , and selected regions far away from the pwn to avoid any contamination .",
    "we tried different background regions and obtained a net count of @xmath27ctsrow@xmath7 in 1 - 8kev range for the 2006 observation .",
    "the uncertainty comes from both the statistical fluctuation and systematic errors due to the background estimate .",
    "we tried independent measurements for the northeast and southwest trails , as well as for each individual exposure , and the results are all consistent . since the readout trail consists of not only counts from the pulsar , but also those from the pwn and snr background in the same columns , the latter have to be subtracted out . excluding the central 3  radius from the pulsar , there are @xmath28 total counts ( 1 - 8kev range ) in a 3  wide rectangular region covering the whole trail of 600 ccd pixels in length .",
    "of these counts , the above estimate suggests that only @xmath29 counts are from the readout artifact and the rest are real events from the pwn , snr and background .",
    "therefore , for a frame time of 1.8s , the pwn and snr contribute a total of @xmath30ctsrow@xmath7 to the readout trail , implying an unpiled count rate of @xmath31ctss@xmath7 for the pulsar in 1 - 8kev range .",
    "note that this is only an upper limit of the true pulsar flux , due to the contamination by the surrounding compact nebula .",
    "this is discussed in the next section . repeating the same exercise on the first epoch obtains a pulsar count rate of @xmath32ctss@xmath7 .",
    "if the pulsar spectrum and the luminosity of the compact nebula remain unchanged between the epochs , the pulsar flux has to increase by a factor of 3.5 in the 1 - 8kev energy band .    the total flux of the pwn shows no physical changes between the epochs .",
    "excluding the central 3  radius , the overall pwn has count rates of 0.59 and 0.61ctss@xmath7 in 1 - 8kev band for the first and second epochs respectively .",
    "the 3% difference is entirely due to the scattering of pulsar counts in the same field - of - view .",
    "we generated a model psf without any pile - up effects , and found that the above region contains 3.5% of the point source counts .",
    "therefore , the increase in the pulsar luminosity can easily explain the excess counts in the pwn.ctss@xmath7 ]    on the other hand , some small - scale features in the pwn do demonstrate significant variability between the observations .",
    "the exposure corrected images in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] clearly show the evolution of the northern clump and the brightening of the southern inner jet . in the 2006 data , the northern clump broadens and",
    "shows a double peak feature .",
    "the count profiles in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] indicate that its peak has shifted 2  outward , while the total flux remains similar .",
    "the southern inner jet also shows hints of morphological evolution : there is an obvious eastern extension at the end of the jet in the 2006 exposure , but it seems to be absent in the first epoch .",
    "detailed studies of the flux and spectral variations of these features will be presented in the following section .",
    "to investigate the spatial variation of the pwn spectrum , we divided the pwn into different regions and extracted their spectra using the script specextract in ciao .",
    "the source and background regions are shown in fig .",
    "as mentioned , the spectra for the 2006 observation were extracted from the four exposure individually , and then fitted jointly . all the spectral fits in this study",
    "were carried out in the 0.5 - 9kev energy range using the sherpa environment .",
    "the spectra from different regions were fitted simultaneously with a global column density but different powerlaw indices .",
    "careful examination of each spectrum shows no spectral or flux variation between the exposures in the 2006 observation .",
    "the best - fit results are listed in table  [ tab2 ] with the corresponding uncertainties in the parameters .",
    "the uncertainties reported here , as well as for the rest of the paper , are 90% confidence intervals for the projected multi - dimensional values , except for the flux values , which are 1-d errors .",
    "the best - fit column density @xmath34@xmath35 obtained from the 2006 observation is consistent with the previous measurements @xcite . comparing the total flux between the epochs",
    "indicates a 3% difference , which is in an excellent agreement with the count rate estimate in the above section .    to determine any spectral variations in the overall pwn between the epochs , we refitted both data sets with the column density fixed at @xmath36@xmath35 , in order to avoid any possible covariance between @xmath37 and other spectral parameters .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab2 ] , indicating no systematic changes in the spectral indices between the observations , and the fluctuation is mostly within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , the table suggests flux variations in regions 1,2,6,9,12 , and 14 .",
    "in particular , the change in region 6 is introduced by the shift of the northern clump into the region . for region 12 ,",
    "the apparent flux increase is the result of pulsar counts scattered into the region , rather than physical changes .",
    "from the same analysis as the above section , we have worked out the expected pulsar flux in the region and found that the value is consistent with the excess flux observed . moreover , the same exercise on the other regions indicates that the flux variations are likely to be physical , but we note that the total flux of the pwn remains unchanged .",
    "[ f6 ] shows the spectral map of the pwn .",
    "the compact nebula at the center has a relatively soft spectrum as compared to the innermost part of many other young pwne .",
    "also , regions along the symmetry axis are systematically harder than the surrounding emission , and the overall spectrum softens as one progresses to larger scales . to further investigate this variation , we extracted the pwn spectra in annular regions and fitted jointly to different powerlaws with a global @xmath38 . the result for the 2006 data",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , the one from the 2000 data is very similar . except for the innermost bin ,",
    "the spectral index increases monotonically with radius .",
    "this trend is commonly observed among pwne , including the crab , 3c  58 and g21.50.9 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the overall nebula , we also carried out spectral analysis for the individual pwn features . to allow a direct comparison between the structures , we minimize the nebular contamination by subtracting the background from adjacent regions .",
    "the extraction regions for the northern clump , southern clump , inner jet , outer jet and southern clump are shown in fig .",
    "as the northern clump shows a double peak structure in the 2006 observation , we further divided the extraction region to determine any spectral difference from the two peaks .",
    "the best - fit spectral parameters with 90% confidence intervals are listed in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the spectral properties vary substantially between the structures . to check",
    "if this could be caused by a variable column density , we tried fitting @xmath38 in the 2006 observation .",
    "however , the lower signal - to - noise ratio of the 2000 data precludes a similar exercise .",
    "the outer jet seems to have a harder spectrum than the other regions , if it is real , it could indicate either high energy emission or a larger absorption column density in the region .",
    "for the northern clump , we do not find any spectral difference for its two peaks . also , the powerlaw index and total luminosity of the clump show no significant change between the two epochs . on the other hand , the flux of the inner jet doubles in the 2006 observation , which could not be accounted for by the scattering of the pulsar psf , since the extraction region is small .",
    "variability in pulsar jets has been observed among many pwn systems , such as the crab , vela and b150958 , with timescales from days to years @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not unexpected to detect variation in the inner jet here , given the two epochs are separated by 6 years , see ",
    "[ s62 ] for more discussion .",
    "we have tried fitting the clump spectra with thermal models to investigate the scenario in which the clumps represent a shock interaction between the jets and the surrounding materials .",
    "we found that a thermal bremsstrahlung provides the best fit among the thermal models , since there is no obvious emission line feature in the spectra .",
    "however , as listed in table  [ tab4 ] , the temperature is not very well constrained and statistically the fit is slightly worse than a simple powerlaw .",
    "we are thus inclined to infer the emission as non - thermal as seen in other pwne .      although the readout trail of the pulsar is free from pile - up , it is much fainter than the background emission from the pwn and the snr shell to yield any high quality spectrum for the pulsar .",
    "therefore , the pulsar spectrum was extracted from the central 2  radius using the script psextract with the same background regions shown in fig .",
    "we rebuilt the response matrix files ( rmfs ) with the tool ` mkacisrmf ` which corrects for the cti , and employed the @xcite model in the fitting to account for the ccd pile - up effects .",
    "again , for the 2006 observation , the spectra were extracted from individual exposure and then fitted jointly .",
    "we did not attempt to fit the column density , as this could be complicated by the pile - up effects and by any possible thermal emission from the pulsar .",
    "instead , it was fixed at the pwn value @xmath39@xmath35 in the analysis .",
    "also , due to contamination from the surrounding compact nebula , a simple background subtraction with an annuli region may lead to inaccurate pile - up estimate .",
    "hence , we fit the source spectrum with a two - powerlaw model : one for the background and the other one for the pulsar .",
    "the former is fixed at the best - fit spectrum of region 12 ( see fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) and we scale its amplitude according to the spatial modeling in  [ s31 ] .",
    "we found that the compact nebula provides 0.05ctss@xmath7 ( 1 - 8kev range ) to the extraction aperture and this is fixed as the nebular background in the fits .",
    "this spectral model provides an adequate fit to the 2000 data and yields a spectral index @xmath40 and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath41ergs@xmath35s@xmath7 in the 0.5 - 10kev range .",
    "the nebular background contributes @xmath42 of the observed flux and the overall spectrum has a pile - up fraction less than 10% .    for the 2006 observation , we started with the same two - powerlaw model , but found that the pulsar spectrum is very close to that of the surrounding compact nebula .",
    "therefore in the final fit , only a single absorbed powerlaw model was used .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] lists the best - fit spectral parameters , indicating a much softer spectrum ( @xmath43 ) , with a factor of 6 increase in the unabsorbed flux ( @xmath44ergs@xmath35s@xmath7 ) in the second epoch .",
    "due to spectral softening , the observed flux only changes by a factor of 4 , suggesting a 6% nebular contamination and a 20% pile - up fraction despite a shorter frame time . comparing the individual spectrum in the 2006 observation shows no short - term flux or spectral variation for the pulsar at this time . as a check for consistency , we convert the above results to the un - piled count rates for the pulsar plus the nebular background .",
    "the inferred count rates in the 1 - 8kev band are 0.17 and 0.77ctss@xmath7 for the 2000 and 2006 observations respectively .",
    "this is in good agreement with the independent estimate from the readout trails in the previous section .",
    "we also note that our results are mostly consistent with the values reported by @xcite and @xcite , but the pulsar spectral index for the first epoch is slightly lower than the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the difference is probably the result of improvements in the pile - up model .    in order to look for any thermal emission from the neutron star",
    ", we have tried adding a blackbody component to the fits . as shown in table  [ tab3 ] , the pl+bb model provides a better fit to the 2006 data in terms of the reduced @xmath45 value .",
    "moreover , an @xmath46-test indicates that this model is statistically better than a single powerlaw at a 99.97% confidence level .",
    "hence , we concluded that the thermal component is significant .",
    "the best - fit blackbody has a temperature of @xmath47kev and a flux @xmath48 of the non - thermal emission .",
    "this implies a blackbody radius of @xmath49 km at 6kpc . for the first epoch ,",
    "a thermal component is not observed and we place a detection limit @xmath50ergss@xmath7@xmath35 at 90% confidence level in 0.5 - 10kev energy range .",
    "at a distance of 6kpc , the overall pwn has a radius @xmath51pc and an x - ray luminosity @xmath52ergss@xmath7 in the 0.5 - 10kev band .",
    "a very rough estimate on the nebula magnetic field can be made based on the x - ray luminosity with the equipartition assumption , or from the snr evolution assuming a constant pulsar spin - down power @xcite .",
    "they both suggest a field strength @xmath53 g . on the other hand , comparing the pwn x - ray and radio spectra @xcite",
    "indicate a spectral break at @xmath54hz @xcite .",
    "if this is solely due to synchrotron cooling , then the pulsar spin - down of @xmath55yr implies a nebula field of @xmath56 mg .",
    "as @xcite point out , this is likely to be too large for the pwn .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the simple standard synchrotron cooling scenario may not hold for this object .",
    "indeed there are many intrinsic and evolutionary effects that could complicate the picture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hess detection of vhe @xmath3-rays from kes  75 provides a better handle on the magnetic field @xcite . in a one zone model assuming all the tev photons come from inverse compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the x - ray and @xmath3-ray fluxes are related to the energy densities of the magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) and the photons ( @xmath58 ) by @xmath59 where @xmath60ergs@xmath61 for the cmb . comparing our result of x - ray flux in 0.5 - 10kev band to the reported hess detection of tev flux in 0.3 - 5tev range suggests @xmath62 , which is comparable to that of g21.50.9 , implying a low magnetic field of @xmath63 g @xcite .",
    "the picture is further supported by the similar radio and x - ray pwn sizes . as compared to the radio images from the vla and the bima array",
    ", the x - ray synchrotron emission extends nearly to the edge of the radio counterpart @xcite .",
    "this suggests a long synchrotron cooling time scale and hence a weak magnetic field .",
    "a nebula field @xmath64 g is adopted throughout the discussion.g do not change our conclusions qualitatively . ]",
    "this field strength gives a magnetic pressure @xmath65dyne@xmath35 in the pwn , with a magnetic energy @xmath66ergs assuming the nebular geometry is a sphere .",
    "this is only 0.1% of the total spin - down energy if the pulsar was born with a spin period close to the current value ; if the pulsar s initial spin period is shorter , the fraction will be even smaller .",
    "numerous theoretical and numerical studies of pwn evolution within an expanding snr suggest that during the first @xmath67 years , a pwn expands freely into the surrounding ejecta before the supernova reverse shock is reached ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". given the young age of kes  75 , the pwn is likely to be in the free expansion phase .",
    "the expansion of light pulsar wind materials into the dense supernova ejecta could result in rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "this may be associated to the protrusions in the pwn boundary , similar to the optical filaments of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the protrusions in the north could also due to ordered magnetic fields , as @xcite proposed for the crab pwn . although a comparison to optical observations will help to identify the nature of these structures",
    ", this may not be observationally feasible due to the large distance of the source and its location on the galactic plane .    to interpret the arc - like feature in the northeast ,",
    "we first note that it is unlikely to be reconciled as a bow shock . due to the young age of the system ,",
    "the pulsar is not expected to move supersonically within the snr interior .",
    "therefore we suggest that the arc could be a toroidal termination shock , which is a commonly observed feature among young pwne .",
    "the shock radius @xmath68 is determined by the balance between the pulsar ram pressure and the ambient pressure @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the pulsar spin - down luminosity and @xmath72 is the fraction of a sphere covered by the pulsar wind ( e.g.  @xmath73 if the wind has a latitude dependence of @xmath74 ) . in this picture , the inferred pressure for our pwn is @xmath75dyne@xmath35 , consistent with the magnetic pressure inside the nebula .",
    "this is also in a general agreement with the numerical simulations of a generic young pwn evolving in a snr @xcite . comparing to the thermal pressure in the snr limbs @xcite",
    ", this value is @xmath76 times lower , confirming that the supernova reverse shock has not yet reached the pwn and that most of the ejecta in the snr interior are still cold .    in general",
    ", we do not expect any significant synchrotron emission inside the termination shock . in this case , the compact nebula surrounding the pulsar could be a result of particle injection from previous outbursts . the synchrotron cooling timescale for a particle emitting at @xmath77kev in the nebula is @xmath78 if an outburst occurs every decade , as suggested by @xcite , then based on the timescale , this could possibly power the emission of the compact nebula .    as an alternative",
    ", one could identify the compact nebula as a termination shock .",
    "the smaller radius @xmath79 only requires a slightly larger magnetic field in the nebula and the ambient pressure is still much lower than the thermal pressure in the rims . in this scenario ,",
    "the arc - like feature could be interpreted as an analogue to the outer arc in g320.41.2 powered by psr b150958 , which @xcite argue is a wisp in the equatorial outflow based on the particles flowing timescale . in our case ,",
    "the flowing timescale from the compact nebula to the arc - like feature is @xmath80 which is shorter than @xmath81 .",
    "this indicates a different physical origin of the arc than the crab nebula s bright outer torus , where most x - ray emitting particles lose their energy .",
    "in contrast to the crab nebula s wisp @xcite , our data do not indicate any significant proper motion in the arc .",
    "similar results have also been reported for the arc surrounding psr b150958 @xcite , and the radio wisp in 3c 58@xcite .",
    "if the variability in our case is compatible , it would be below the current detection sensitivity given the relatively shallow exposure of the first epoch .",
    "finally , we discuss the spectral softening of the pwn with increasing distance from the pulsar , as shown in fig .",
    "this is a result of particle energy dissipation due to synchrotron burn - off and nebula expansion .",
    "although some theoretical models predict a rapid increase in the spectral index ( e.g. , fig . 4 in * ? ?",
    "* ) , such degree of variation is not observed here . indeed",
    "the variation @xmath82 in our case is smaller than many other systems , such as 3c  58 or g21.50.9 @xcite , indicating a long synchrotron cooling time in the pwn .",
    "the slightly softer spectrum in the innermost bin could be due to the injection of lower energy particles from any pulsar bursts in the past , or simply because the next two bins are contaminated by the polar outflow which has a harder spectrum .",
    "the jet - like features along the pwn symmetric axis show systematically harder spectra than their surroundings , indicating a large velocity in the polar outflow , i.e.  @xmath83 .",
    "if the absence of a counter inner jet in the north is due to doppler boosting , then its detection limit provides an estimate of the flow speed .",
    "the flux ratio between the inner jet and its expected counterpart is given by @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "from the the best - fit inclination angle @xmath85 and the photon index @xmath86 for the jet , the detection limit on the counter jet sets its minimum bulk velocity @xmath87 .",
    "this is comparable to jets in other pulsars such as the crab , vela and b150958 @xcite . to estimate the magnetic field in the jet , we approximate the southern inner jet by a cylinder with 1.5  diameter and a length of @xmath88 , which correspond to 0.04 and 0.1pc respectively at 6kpc .",
    "the best - fit spectral luminosity @xmath89ergss@xmath7kev@xmath7 at 5kev suggests an equipartition field @xmath90 g with a total energy @xmath91ergs for the inner jet , where @xmath92 is the ion to electron energy and @xmath93 is the filling factor ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". the synchrotron cooling time for particles emitting at 5kev in the jet is then @xmath94yr , confirming that @xmath95yr .",
    "this also implies a minimum power input from the pulsar @xmath96ergss@xmath7 , which is 1.4% of the total spin - down luminosity .",
    "we argue that the variability in the polar outflow is unlikely due to the recent pulsar bursts .",
    "since the 2006 observation was carried out 7 days after the bursts , materials traveling from the pulsar to the end of the inner jet requires an apparent superluminal motion @xmath97 in the plane of the sky , which is related to the true space velocity @xmath25 by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the angle between the direction of motion and the observer line of sight . as @xmath100 , this places an upper limit @xmath101 .",
    "the best - fit pulsar spin axis inclination @xmath102 indicates that the observed variability in the jet could not be explained by any superluminal motion in the polar outflow . for any emission in a random direction that beamed towards the earth with @xmath103",
    ", there is an additional constraint for the alignment with the jet direction on the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore the chance probability is very small and we conclude that the variability of the inner jet is almost certainly unrelated to the recent bursts . a similar argument also applies to the northern clump . due to the strong magnetic field and compact size of the inner jet ,",
    "the alfvn crossing time is in the order of 100 days , which is comparable to @xmath104 .",
    "given the two epochs separate by 6 years , we could not distinguish whether the inner jet variability is due to mhd instability as is possibly so in the cases of vela and psr b150958 jets @xcite , or simply due to materials flowing downstream .",
    "as one moves downstream along the jet , spectral softening is generally expected as a result of synchrotron burn - off . however , the outer jet region shows some hints of a harder spectrum than the inner jet , which is difficult to understand unless there is a continuous particle acceleration along the way @xcite or particle injection from a shock ( see below ) .",
    "an alternative explanation could be variability in the absorption column density , although this requires a nearly 20% change in @xmath38 across the regions ( table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "further out along the jet direction , emission on both sides of the pulsar terminates abruptly at the northern and southern clumps .",
    "the similar spectral indices of the two clumps hint that the emission may come from the same physical process , but their relative brightness suggests that they could not be simply reconciled as doppler boosted jets .",
    "it is possible that the clumps are results of non - thermal emission from the shock interaction between the polar outflow and the ambient medium . when the supersonic pulsar jets encounter the supernova ejecta , the density gradient results in a bow shock and leads to strong x - ray emission .",
    "indeed the sharp edge of the pwn near the southern clump provides some evidence of such a density gradient and this likely results in the clump .",
    "the one in the north is less obvious , which could be due to projection effects . comparing to other pwn systems",
    ", a similar scenario has been proposed to associate the x - ray features in rcw  89 with psr b150958 @xcite .",
    "the difference in our case is that the clumps are found on both sides and much closer to the pulsar .",
    "besides , the clumps are likely to be non - thermal . also , due to the younger age of kes  75 , the jets would encounter a cold ambient medium which has not yet been heated up by the supernova reverse shock .",
    "if we compare to other astrophysical jets ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the clumps may be identified as analogues to the terminal hotspots in the extragalactic jets , which usually have non - thermal spectra well - modeled by synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton emission @xcite .",
    "then the outer jet in our case could be a backflow cocoon formed by the postshock materials , and the hard spectrum in the region could be related to the shock accelerated particles .",
    "moreover , the variability of the northern clump can be attributed to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , as the jet expands into the much denser ejecta .",
    "the luminosity of the northern clump is @xmath105 , which can be easily powered by the jets , and the flow time scale @xmath106yr is substantially shorter than the synchrotron cooling time @xmath107yr",
    ". therefore the particles are still energetic on reaching the edge of the pwn .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations , in particular high resolution radio maps of the pwn could help to further investigate the nature of the clumps .",
    "the best - fit pulsar spectrum for the second epoch indicates a @xmath48 flux contribution from the blackbody component , which is not observed in the 2000 data .",
    "this suggests that the thermal emission is likely related to the afterglow of the recent bursts , and could be part of the transition between a rotation - powered pulsar to a magnetar with persistent emission as pointed out by @xcite . in the quiescent state ,",
    "our flux measurement indicates a pulsar luminosity @xmath108ergss@xmath7 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the original 19kpc distance estimate implies enormous x - ray efficiencies for the pulsar and the pwn .",
    "the new distance estimate of 6kpc greatly reduces the pulsar luminosity by an order of magnitude .",
    "now the pulsar has an x - ray efficiency @xmath109 , which is no longer an outlier , but rather typical among young neutron stars ( see * ? ? ? * ) . for the pwn ,",
    "the luminosity @xmath110ergss@xmath7 and efficiency @xmath111 are still larger than many others , but not exceptional . also , @xmath112 is close to the mean value of 4 obtained by @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the x - ray properties of psr j18460258 in quiescence are not much different from an ordinary young neutron star s .",
    "as compared to the crab pulsar , psr j18460258 has a higher surface magnetic field but its nebular field is much weaker .",
    "this seems to imply no direct correlation between the magnetic field strengths on a neutron star surface and in its surrounding pwn .",
    "although the exact nature of the arc - like feature remains unknown , in either the equatorial torus or equatorial wisp interpretation , the pulsar spin orientation can still be inferred from the spatial modeling .",
    "@xcite propose a scenario in which the angle between the spin and magnetic axis is @xmath113 in order to explain the pulsar s braking index in terms of the vacuum - dipole model @xcite .",
    "if this is real , then the spin inclination @xmath114 obtained from the torus fitting indicates a magnetic inclination @xmath115 .",
    "the large @xmath25 is consistent with the non - detection of radio pulsations .",
    "this picture also predicts that no pulsed @xmath3-rays will be observable according to the @xcite model .",
    "future glast observations will address this .",
    "in this study , we have carried out detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the pwn in kes  75 .",
    "the deep chandra observations reveal the axisymmetric structure of the pwn with jet and torus features .",
    "we deduce an average nebula field @xmath116 g from the x - ray emissivity and interpret the arc - like structure in the northeast as equatorial outflow , either a toroidal termination shock or a wisp .",
    "we further apply a torus fitting scheme and show that the arc has a radius of @xmath117 , inclined at @xmath118 to the plane of the sky with the symmetry axis at a position angle @xmath119 .",
    "the spatially resolved spectrum of the pwn shows that regions along the jet direction have systematically harder spectrum than the surroundings , suggesting a high velocity in the polar outflow .",
    "we also deduce a minimum flow velocity of 0.4@xmath1 based on the non - detection of a counter jet .",
    "there are two bright clumps aligned with the jet , which we propose due to bow shocks of the polar outflow in the supernova ejecta . over a period of 6 years",
    ", the northern clump and the inner jet demonstrate strong variability , which could be attributed to mhd instabilities .",
    "accompanying the recent outburst , the pulsar luminosity has increased by 6 times and shows substantial softening in the spectrum .",
    "we also find an emerging thermal component in the pulsar spectrum , which could be related to the thermal afterglow of the bursts .",
    "the 2000 observation suggests a pulsar x - ray efficiency of 0.3% .",
    "this value is not particularly large among young neutron stars . in this aspect ,",
    "psr j18460258 was a rather typical pulsar in x - rays during quiescence .",
    "further investigation of the pwn properties will require high resolution multi - wavelength observations .",
    "also , long - term monitoring of the source would be fruitful .",
    "the evolution of the thermal component in the pulsar spectrum can indicate any physical changes of the hotspot on the neutron star surface , thus probing the nature of the bursts .",
    "moreover , as this is the only known example of magnetar - like bursts inside a pwn , any flux variation in the nebula that is associated with the bursts could reveal the energy transport in the system .",
    "this connection provides a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of both pwn and magnetar physics .",
