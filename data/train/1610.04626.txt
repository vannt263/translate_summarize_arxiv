    "the following problem had been stated in the kvant journal  ( see@xcite ) and had been included into the famous problem book on planimetry  ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , problem 158 ) ) .",
    "it is known that , for a given triangle , the points where the bisectors meet opposite sides form an isosceles triangle .",
    "does it imply that the given triangle is isosceles ?",
    "the answer is negative .",

    "maybe , the readers can construct an explicit example . '' _    for a given triangle ,",
    "we call the triangle formed by the intersection points of the bisectors with opposite sides the _ bisectral triangle _",
    "( on the  figure  [ fig : triangle1 ] triangle @xmath0 is bisectral for  @xmath1 ) .",
    "we call a triangle a _ sharygin triangle _ if it is scalene but its bisectral triangle is isosceles",
    ".    this work is completely devoted to the detailed study of sharygin triangles .    a great enthusiast of school mathematical contests sergei markelov told us that ,",
    "amazingly , a sharygin triangle can be constructed if we take a side of the right heptagon and two different adjacent diagonals ( see the proof in section  [ sec : ex ] ) .",
    "it turns out that any sharygin triangle has an obtuse angle ( it is proved in  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if  @xmath2 denotes its cosine , then  @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the angle measure is between @xmath4 and  @xmath5 . in the example arising from the right heptagon we get the obtuse angle  @xmath6 . in respect",
    "that the range of suitable angles is very small , this example is totally amazing and surprising .",
    "consequently , the following question arises naturally : are there other examples of right polygons such that three of its vertices form a sharygin triangle ?",
    "study of this problem has led us to some beautiful formulas , but has not led yet to new examples .    of course , an integer sharygin triangle would be a kind of `` triumph '' in the problem to construct explicit examples of sharygin triangles .    to solve this problem",
    "s.markelov started a computation running over all triangles with side lengths not exceeding million .",
    "no such luck , after two months ( in  1996 or around ) the computer answered that there are no examples .",
    "nevertheless , sergei had not calmed down .",
    "evidently , something suggested him the right answer .",
    "consider a triangle  @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 its bisectors and by    @xmath10    its side lengths ( see  figure  [ fig : triangle1 ] ) .",
    "sergei considered the replacement @xmath11 this replacement is well known in planimetry . for @xmath12 being the side lengths of a triangle , @xmath13 are distances from vertices to the points where the incircle meets the adjacent sides  ( see  figure  [ fig : triangle2 ] ) .",
    ".45        .45     sergei had rewritten the equation in terms of  @xmath13 : @xmath14 it is enough that  @xmath15 for  @xmath12 to satisfy the triangle inequalities .",
    "we see that the condition  @xmath16 becomes a cubic equation on  @xmath13 without the monomials  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the corresponding projective curve  @xmath19 on the projective plane with coordinates  @xmath20 contains the points  @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "sergei divided the equation by  @xmath23 passing to the affine chart  @xmath24 with the coordinates  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 , and guessed that the point @xmath27 lies on the curve .",
    "the equation of the curve  @xmath19 is quadratic in  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 . on the next step",
    "sergei reopened the addition law of the points on an elliptic curve .",
    "namely , he guessed a rational point and started to draw vertical and horizontal lines through the points that are already constructed .",
    "if we have a point  @xmath30 on  @xmath19 , then the vertical line intersects the curve in two points ( actually , in three points , where the third point is on infinity ) .",
    "the equation on these two points has rational coefficients , and we know one solution that is rational .",
    "therefore , the other one is also rational .",
    "if we make after the same construction with the horizontal line through the new point and obtain the point  @xmath31 , then this construction of  @xmath31 from  @xmath30 corresponds to the addition of some point  @xmath32 to  @xmath30 on the curve  @xmath19 .",
    "( we need to define the origin of our elliptic curve to determine the point  @xmath33 that does not depend on the choice of  @xmath30 . ) iterating this algorithm ( passing from  @xmath30 to  @xmath34 ) , sergei obtained on the fourth step a triangle , i.e.a  point with  @xmath35 . replacing the coordinates back to  @xmath12 ,",
    "sergei obtained @xmath36 .",
    "it is not surprising that the computer program running over values before million gives nothing , while the presumably first integer triangle has so grandiose side lengths ! sergei would have found this triangle , if he started the program running the side lengths not exceeding billion on a more powerful computer some time after .",
    "fortunately , the modern computers are not so powerful .",
    "this led us to the addition law on the elliptic curve and to some more complicated theory .",
    "as a result , we have proved that there are infinitely many non - similar integer sharygin triangles . in this way",
    ", the school - level problem has led us to a beautiful branch of modern mathematics .    in this work we consider the question of how to construct each integer sharygin triangle .",
    "integer sharygin triangles correspond to rational points of the elliptic curve  @xmath19 lying in some open subset ( defined by the triangle inequalities ) .",
    "therefore , we need to describe the group of rational points on the curve . here",
    "we find the torsion subgroup , find the rank and give an element of the free part ( it seems to be a generator ) .",
    "if this point of infinite order is a generator , then all the integer sharygin triangles can be constructed from the points that we have found , by the addition of points on  @xmath19 .",
    "the authors are grateful to sergei markelov for introducing the problem and a series of useful tricks in the first rough solution .",
    "also the authors are grateful to v.a.voronov , n.tsoy , d.v.osipov , s.s.galkin , i.a.cheltsov , s.o.gorchinsky and other participants of the conference < < magadan algebraic geometry > > for useful discussions and advices .",
    "we are grateful to n.n.osipov for the proof of proposition  [ orda = inf simple ] .",
    "lastly , we should explain elementary character of the exposition .",
    "the point was to introduce wide public   students , non - algebraic mathematicians and alike   to the magic of elliptic curves , starting from the absolutely clear , school - level problem .",
    "that is why we do not restrict ourselves to refer to standard but involved results from the arithmetics and algebraic aspects of elliptic curves , instead giving absolutely elementary proofs to most of our statements .",
    "we wish that students would find their speciality in studying elliptic curves , after reading this introductory text .",
