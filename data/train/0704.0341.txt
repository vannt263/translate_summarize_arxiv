    "the total resummation of @xmath139 allows to correct several misconceptions popular in the literature .",

    "+ * misconception 1 * : impact of non - leading perturbative and non - perturbative contributions on the intercepts of @xmath2 is large .    * actually : * confronting our results and the estimates of the intercepts in refs .",
    "@xcite obtained from fitting available experimental data manifests that the total contribution of non - leading perturbaive and non - perturbative contributions to the intercepts is very small , so the main impact on the intercepts is brought by the leading logarithms . +",
    "* misconception 2 * : intercepts of @xmath2 should depend on @xmath4 through the parametrization of the qcd coupling @xmath200 .    *",
    "actually : * this is groundless from the theoretical point of view and appears only if the the parametrization of the qcd coupling @xmath201 is kept in all ladder rungs .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this parametrization can not be used at small @xmath3 and should be replaced by the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . +",
    "* misconception 3 * : initial densities @xmath202 and @xmath203 are singular but they are defined at @xmath3 not too small . later , being convoluted with the coefficient functions , they become less singular .",
    "* actually : * it is absolutely wrong : eq .",
    "( [ fitaomega ] ) proves that the pole singularity @xmath191 in the fits does not become weaker with the @xmath3-evolution . + * misconception 4 * : fits for the initial parton densities are complicated because they mimic unknown non - perturbative contributions .",
    "* actually : * our results demonstrate that the singular factors in the fits mimic the total resummation of @xmath139 and can be dropped when the resummation is accounted for . in the regular part of the fits the @xmath3 -dependence is essential for large @xmath3 only , so",
    "impact of non - perturbative contributions is weak at the small-@xmath3 region .",
    "+ * misconception 5 * : total resummations of @xmath139 may become of some importance at extremely small @xmath3 but not for @xmath3 available presently and in a forthcoming future .",
    "* actually : * the efficiency of sa in the available small-@xmath3 range is based on exploiting the singular factors in the standard fits to mimic the resummations .",
    "so , the resummations have always been used in sa at small @xmath3 in an inexplicit way , through the fits , but without being aware of it .",
    "the total resummaton of leading logarithms of @xmath3 considered in sect .",
    "iv is essential at small-@xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath204 , all terms @xmath205 in the coefficient functions and anomalous dimensions can not have a big impact compared to other terms .",
    "dglap accounts for those terms .",
    "it makes dglap be more precise at large @xmath3 than our approach .",
    "so , there appears an obvious appeal to combine the dglap coefficient functions and anomalous dimensions with our expressions in order to obtain an approach equally good in the whole range of @xmath206 .",
    "the prescription for such combining was suggested in ref .",
    "let us , for the sake of simplicity , consider here combining the total resummation and lo dglap .",
    "the generalization to nlo dglap can be done quite similarly .",
    "the prescription consists of the following points :    * step a : * take eqs .",
    "( [ lo ] ) and replace @xmath5 by @xmath155 of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , converting @xmath126 into @xmath207 and @xmath208 into @xmath209 .",
    "* step b : * sum up the obtained expressions and eqs .",
    "( [ cns],[hns ] ) : @xmath210 new expressions @xmath211 combine the total resummation and dglap but they obviously contain the double counting : some of the first ",
    "loop contributions are present both in eqs .",
    "( [ lo ] ) and in eqs .",
    "( [ cns],[hns ] ) . to avoid the double counting ,",
    "let us expend eqs .",

    "( [ fnsint ] ) leads to the expression for @xmath123 equally good at large and small @xmath3 .",
    "this description does not require singular factors in the fits for the initial parton densities .",
    "an alternative approach for combining dla expression for @xmath2 was suggested in ref .",
    ". however , the parametrization of @xmath5 in this approach was simply borrowed from dglap , which makes this approach be unreliable at small @xmath3 .",
    "we have briefly considered the essence of the iree method together with examples of its application to different processes .",
    "they demonstrate that iree is indeed the efficient and reliable instrument for all - orders calculations in qed , qcd and the standard model of ew interactions . as an example in favor of this point ,",
    "let us just remind that there exist wrong expressions for the singlet @xmath2 in dla obtained with an alternative technique and the exponentiation of ew double logarithms obtained in ref .  @xcite had previously been denied in several papers where other methods of all - order summations were used .",
