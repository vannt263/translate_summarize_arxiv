    "the radio source b0218 + 357 has been identified as a gravitationally lensed system ( patnaik et al .",
    "the source , which has a core - halo structure at low frequency ( 1.4  ghz ) and low resolution ( 5  arcsec ) , consists of two compact flat - spectrum components , a and b , separated by 335 milliarcsec .",
    "the weaker of the two , b , is surrounded by a faint einstein ring of similar diameter .",
    "the spectral and polarisation characteristics of the components show them to be the lensed images of a single flat spectrum ` core ' .",
    "the lensing galaxy , suggested to be a spiral galaxy , has been observed by the hst ( jackson et al .",
    "it has a redshift of 0.6847 ( browne et al .",
    "1993 ) . atomic hydrogen and many molecular species have been detected in absorption against the background source ( carilli et al .",
    "1993 , wiklind & combes 1995 , menten & reid 1996 ) .",
    "the redshift of the background object is suggested to be 0.96 ( lawrence 1996 ) .    in this contribution",
    "we explore the properties of the radio source from our multi - frequency vlbi observations .",
    "we give a summary of our observations and discuss the results in the context of a flat spectrum radio source .",
    "we note that the overall radio spectrum of b0218 + 357 is flat between 365  mhz and 43  ghz i.e. its flux density is constant within a factor of two between these frequencies .",
    "b0218 + 357 has been observed at 1.7 , 5 , 15 , 22 and 43  ghz over the last several years in order to understand its small  scale structure and thereby derive constraints for the lens models .",
    "the 1.7 and 5  ghz observations were carried out in 1992 with a global array using the mk3 vlbi system and the vlba was used for the higher frequency observations .",
    "about 10 telescopes were used in each of the observing sessions .",
    "the global array data were correlated at the mpifr , bonn . the data at 15 , 22 and 43  ghz were taken using the vlba with a bandwidth of 64  mhz .",
    "the data were kept in 8  mhz channels to avoid bandwidth smearing .",
    "the data were analysed using the nrao aips software package .",
    "the 1.7 , 5 and 15  ghz maps are published by porcas & patnaik ( 1996a ) , another 15  ghz map and 22 and 43  ghz maps are published by porcas & patnaik ( 1996b ) . in this contribution",
    "we show a 15  ghz map ( patnaik , porcas & browne 1995 ) to identify the different components ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    at resolutions around a few milliarcsec",
    "we are not sensitive to extended emission from the einstein ring . at",
    "resolutions higher than about 1  mas , which is achieved for frequencies higher than 8.4  ghz , each of the lensed images , a and b , is resolved into a ` core - jet ' structure ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we identify a1 ( the south - western component of a ) and its lensed counterpart b1 ( the western component of b ) as the core of the background radio source .",
    "correspondingly , a2 and b2 are identified as part of the jet .",
    "this identification is justified from the fact that a1 and b1 have flatter spectra than a2 and b2 ( table 1 , fig .",
    "2 ) and also from the fact that they are unresolved at 43  ghz with a resolution of 0.2  mas .    the images a and b have diffuse structure at 1.7 and 5  ghz such that it is difficult match corresponding features in them .",
    "image a shows characteristic ` tangential ' elongation in pa @xmath040@xmath1 .",
    "this elongation is also seen at higher frequencies .",
    "the other noticeable feature is the rather dramatic increase in size of image a and b with wavelength .",
    "even though the sizes of the images increase with decreasing frequency , their surface brightnesses at low levels are the same as expected from gravitational lensing",
    ".    .flux densities ( in mjy ) of components in b0218 + 357 . [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     table 1 summarises the results of the multi - frequency vlbi observations .",
    "the flux densities of various components ( identified in fig.1 ) are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "we derive two basic results from these observations , namely the spectral decomposition of various components and the ratio of their flux densities as a function of frequency .",
    "since we resolve the ` core - jet ' structure in a and b at frequencies higher than 8.4  ghz , we have 4 measurements of flux density for these components .",
    "the spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the spectrum of the core ( a1 and b1 ) is self - absorbed with a peak around 15  ghz .",
    "the jet ( a2 and b2 ) has steep spectra above 8.4  ghz .",
    "however , the total flux density of a and b at 1.7 and 5  ghz suggest that both a2 and b2 must also be self - absorbed between these two frequencies .",
    "the einstein ring emission has a steeper spectrum between 5 and 22  ghz and it must also be self - absorbed at lower frequencies since the total flux density provides a limit ( patnaik et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in summary , the radio structure of b0218 + 357",
    "consists of at least 3 distinct components , core , jet and the einstein ring , which are all self - absorbed at different frequencies .",
    "the components are self - absorbed at progressively lower frequencies as one moves from the core along the jet .",
    "this behaviour of the radio source is consistent with its flat spectrum ( cotton et al .",
    "1980 ) .",
    "the core , being self - absorbed around 15  ghz , contributes very little to the emission at 1.7 and 5  ghz , where the emission is dominated by the jet as evident from the spectra .",
    "perhaps it is not surprising therefore that the radio structures of both a and b at 1.7  ghz appear diffuse .",
    "however , this poses a difficulty in that a self - absorbed component , which must be compact , has a large observed size . in this case",
    "one must consider the intrinsic size of the source rather than the observed size which has been magnified by the lens .",
    "another result from our observations is that the image flux ratios change with frequency .",
    "this is an apparent contradiction since gravitational lensing is achromatic .",
    "however , since the source is extended and spans areas of different image magnifications the observed flux ratio can indeed vary with frequency .",
    "the flux ratio of the core ( i.e. a1/b1 ) is around 3.7 for frequencies higher than 8.4  ghz .",
    "this is similar to the ratio of a / b obtained from vla observations at these frequencies ( patnaik et al .",
    "1993 ) . at lower frequencies",
    "the flux ratio a / b is around 2.6 .",
    "of course , we point out that the source is variable at high frequencies and thus the measured flux ratio can be different due to differential time delay .    the above results lead to a rather simple model for b0218 + 357 .",
    "the radio source consists of a number of different components which are self - absorbed at different frequencies thus conspiring to produce the observed flat spectrum .",
    "the core ( imaged into a1 and b1 ) is located at the western - most edge , the jet ( imaged into a2 and b2 ) lies between the core and the component giving rise to the einstein ring .",
    "the core dominates the radio structure at frequencies higher than 8.4  ghz , and the jet and the einstein ring dominate at lower frequencies . at lower frequencies",
    "one does not detect any compact feature in the source since the core contributes very little to the flux density .",
    "we would like to thank athol kemball for allowing us to quote results before publication and karl menten for his comments .",
