    "very high energy ( vhe ; 30 gev30 tev ) photons do not travel unimpeded through cosmological distances in the universe .",
    "a flux attenuation is expected due to photon - photon pair production with the lower energy photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) in the ultraviolet , optical , and infrared ( ir ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ebl is the radiation emitted by star formation processes ( star light and star light absorbed / re - emitted by dust ) plus a small contribution from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) integrated over redshift over all the cosmic star - formation history ( @xcite ) . due to the properties of the interaction , a vhe photon of a given energy interacts mainly with an ebl photon within a",
    "well defined and narrow wavelength range .",
    "therefore , a signature of the ebl spectral distribution is expected in the observed vhe spectra of extragalactic sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature in the observed vhe spectra of extragalactic sources as a consequence of ebl absorption is given by the cosmic @xmath0-ray horizon ( cgrh ) , which has not been clearly observed yet .",
    "the cgrh is by definition the energy , @xmath1 , at which the optical depth of the photon - photon pair production becomes unity as a function of redshift .",
    "therefore , it gives an estimate of how far vhe photons can travel through the universe .",
    "due to the exponential behavior of the flux attenuation , an alternative definition is the energy at which the intrinsic spectrum is attenuated by the ebl by a factor of @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( the intrinsic source spectrum is the one that we would observe if there were no effect from the ebl , also known as the ebl - corrected spectrum . )    an extreme category of agns , known as blazars , has been shown to be the best target for extragalactic vhe detections .",
    "they are characterized by having their energetic @xmath0-ray jets pointing towards us .",
    "in fact , most of the extragalactic sources already detected by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas ( @xcite , respectively ) are blazars .",
    "the observations of broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars show that they are characterized by a double - peaked shape and that their emission covers all the electromagnetic spectrum from radio up to the most energetic @xmath0-rays .",
    "the synchrotron / synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model provides a successful explanation for this behavior for most cases ( @xcite ) . in this framework",
    "a population of ultra - relativistic electrons causes the lower energy peak by synchrotron emission , while the second peak is then accounted for by inverse compton production of @xmath0-rays from the same population of high energy electrons and photons in the low energy peak .",
    "the direct observation of the cgrh in the vhe spectra of blazars remains elusive .",
    "this is due to two main observational difficulties .",
    "first , the lack of knowledge of the intrinsic spectra at vhe .",
    "extensive multiwavelength campaigns from radio up to @xmath0-rays are needed in order to predict the unattenuated vhe emission from the synchrotron / ssc model with enough precision .",
    "these campaigns should preferably be simultaneous due to the short - time flux variability of blazars ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation , the typical procedure in the literature to estimate the intrinsic vhe spectrum is either to assume a limit for the hardness of the slope @xmath3 with @xmath4 ( @xcite ) or to extrapolate the _",
    "fermi_-large area telescope ( lat ) spectrum up to higher energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , it has been possible only in recent years to detect a considerable number of blazars in the gev energy range to allow us a statistical analysis .",
    "a large sample is necessary to reject intrinsic behaviors in the sources that mimic the effect of the cgrh .",
    "this improvement has been made thanks to the large data sets provided by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite ( @xcite ) and the iacts .",
    "the only estimations of the cgrh so far are ebl - model - dependent lower limits from vhe observations of blazars ( @xcite ) , lower limits from _",
    "fermi_-lat observations of blazars ( @xcite ) , and the predictions from ebl models ( @xcite , hereafter d11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "( a table with a classification and description of the ingredients of these ebl models can be found in the proceeding by @xcite . ) indeed , an independent observation of the cgrh will also provide a completely independent and new test to the modeling of the ebl and consequently constraints on galaxy evolution .",
    "furthermore , the cgrh measurement also can be useful to estimate the cosmological parameters with a novel and independent methodology ( @xcite ; domnguez & prada , submitted ) .",
    "the detection of the cgrh is a primary scientific goal of the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the blazar catalog used in our analysis .",
    "the methodology is explained in section  [ sec : methodology ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the results obtained from our analysis and in section  [ sec : discussion ] the results are discussed .",
    "finally , a brief summary of the main results is presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper a standard @xmath5cdm cosmology is assumed , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a catalog of quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength data from radio up to vhe for 15 blazars has been built .",
    "the data for energies lower than the _ fermi_-lat regime ( 20  mev@xmath10300  gev ; @xcite ) are taken from the data compilation presented by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for references and details of the different data sets and their simultaneity . that catalog is combined here with _",
    "fermi_-lat data from the second _ fermi_-lat agn catalog ( 2fgl , @xcite ) and the new _ fermi_-lat hard - spectrum catalog ( 1fhl , ackermann et al . , in preparation ) , which include two and three years of _ fermi_-lat data , respectively .",
    "the second _ fermi _ agn catalog contains fluxes in the following six energy bins : 30100  mev , 100300  mev , 300  mev1  gev , 13  gev , 310  gev and 10100  gev .",
    "the _ fermi _ hard - spectrum catalog contains fluxes for the sources with the highest - energy emission in three bins that reach higher energy than the ones used in the second - year catalog ( 1030  gev , 30100  gev and 100500  gev ) .",
    "our final catalog includes data from iacts as well .",
    "we use simultaneous vhe data from iacts when available ; otherwise the iact observation closest in time to the lower - energy data is used following the suggestions by @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the 15 sources in the set of blazars that we study here .",
    "the catalog presented in @xcite contains 24 blazars , however we could not use all of them due to non - detections either by _ fermi _ or the iacts , which are essential for applying our methodology ( see section  [ sec : methodology ] ) .",
    "our catalog covers a wide redshift range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and all 15 blazars are classified as bl - lac sources ( which are typically characterized by rapid and large - amplitude flux variability and significant optical polarization ) .",
    "we note that in the cases of pg  1553 + 113 and 3c  66a the redshifts are uncertain , but still these sources are included in the analysis .",
    "a redshift in the range @xmath13 is estimated for pg  1553 + 113 by danforth et al .",
    "( 2010 , the upper limit is @xmath14 ) .",
    "the blazar 3c 66a typically is cited as having a redshift of @xmath15 , which is used here as well ( cf . @xcite ) .",

    "these models predict the unattenuated vhe fluxes , which are compared with detections by iacts .",
    "the ratios between the unattenuated and detected vhe fluxes give an estimate of the ebl optical depth . by means of a maximum likelihood technique that is independent of any ebl model and",
    "that is based only on a few physically motivated assumptions , we then derive the cgrh for each blazar .      for every blazar in our sample",
    ", we built a quasi - simultaneous sed based on the data collected by @xcite and on the lat data from the second _ fermi_-lat agn catalog ( @xcite ) and the hard source catalog ( ackermann et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these data are shown in the insets of figure  [ fig : e0fits ] . in many cases ,",
    "these seds are not constructed from strictly simultaneous data . however , since we preferentially choose seds that are for a low state , we expect that the effects of variability are minimal in the @xmath0-ray energy range .",
    "we then fit the unique multiwavelength data of each source with a synchrotron / ssc model using a @xmath16 minimization technique .",
    "the model and fitting technique are fully described in finke , dermer & bttcher ( 2008 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this model includes photoabsorption by photons internal to the blob . since bl lac objects and their presumed misaligned counterparts",
    ", fr  i radio galaxies usually lack optically thick dust tori ( @xcite ) we do not include photoabsorption from this radiation source , although it could in principle be important .",
    "we note that for 1es  1959 + 650 , there is evidence for an optically thick dust component ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we did not obtain positive results with this source , as discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "the fitting technique is double nested , with the _ inner loop _ fitting the synchrotron component with a particular electron distribution . in this paper",
    ", we use a broken power - law for the electron distribution with an exponential cutoff at high energies , that is , at @xmath17 . in some cases ( mrk  421 , 1es  2344 + 514 , pks  2005@xmath18489 , h  2356@xmath18309 , 1es  218 + 304 , and 1es  1101@xmath18232 ) we found that a single power - law with exponential cutoff was sufficient to provide good fits .",
    "our fits have as free parameters the electron indices @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; the minimum , maximum , and break electron lorentz factors , @xmath21 , @xmath17 , and @xmath22 , respectively ; and the overall normalization",
    ". often @xmath21 and @xmath17 were kept constant during the fit .",
    "the _ outer loop _ fit the ssc model the high energy data , and has three free parameters : the doppler factor , @xmath23 ; the magnetic field strength , @xmath24 ; and the minimum variability timescale , @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the bulk lorentz factor @xmath26 . in the fits ,",
    "@xmath25 was kept constant , with only @xmath23 and @xmath24 as free parameters .",
    "we discuss in more detail our choices of @xmath25 below . in the fits , we specifically leave off the iact data ; we only fit the ir through the lat @xmath0-rays .",
    "we use any radio points as upper limits , since this emission is likely from another region of the jet .",
    "we leave out the iact data because for this fit , we are fitting data which are unaffected by ebl attenuation",
    ". in some of the more distant sources , the highest energy lat point ( at energy @xmath27  gev ) can suffer significant attenuation .",
    "therefore , we remove this data point for sources at @xmath28 .",
    "this choice is supported by a variety of observational evidences ( see @xcite ) .",
    "once we have the resulting model curve from our fit that includes the extrapolation to vhe energies ( the overall model is shown with a black line in the insets of figure  [ fig : e0fits ] ) , we use this as the unattenuated / intrinsic spectrum for the source .",
    "we compare it with the flux observed from the iact detection to calculate the absorption optical depth ,    @xmath29    for photons observed in an energy bin centered at energy @xmath30 and a source at redshift @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the observed differential flux and @xmath33 is the intrinsic flux at the energies given by the iact detection the fluxes given by the synchrotron / ssc model evaluated at the energies sampled by the iact .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath34 come directly from the uncertainties in the iact observations .",
    "the @xmath35 data are shown with blue crosses in figure  [ fig : e0fits ] .",
    "the method used here for measuring @xmath36 is similar to the one described by @xcite .    for the synchrotron / ssc model , the radius of the spherical emitting region ,",
    "@xmath37 is determined from the minimum variability timescale , @xmath25 , which is in turn constrained by the observed variability timescale through light travel time arguments so that @xmath38 ( @xcite ) . for consistency",
    ", we used the same @xmath25 for all of our blazars , @xmath39  s and @xmath40  s. as we see in section  [ sec : results ] , the choice of variability time makes very little difference to the model curve , although it has a large effect on the model fit parameters , which are not the focus of this paper .",
    "thus we are confident that the choice of @xmath25 has little effect on our resulting measurement of @xmath36 . however , although the two ssc models are similar they predict different vhe fluxes , which allows us to include the uncertainty in the variability timescale in our analysis .",
    "it should be noted that several sources have been observed to have extremely rapid ( @xmath41  s ) variability timescales ( @xcite ) .",
    "these rapid flares are quite rare , and since we have chosen seds from blazars in a quiescent state , we think these short timescales ( and the small emitting regions they imply ) are unlikely . furthermore , we have fit several of our objects with @xmath42  s and found the resulting doppler factors to be extremely high , @xmath43 a few hundred , and in two cases ( 1es  1101@xmath18232 and 3c  66a ) as high as 1000 .",

    "lower order polynomials are not sufficient to describe the optical depth .",
    "higher order polynomials introduce too many degrees of freedom and increase the computational time without increasing the precision of our analysis .",
    "this shape of the opacity ( which is the integral of the ebl spectral intensity and the pair - production cross section ; see @xcite ) is expected in the vhe range for two main reasons .",
    "first , the ebl sed must have a smooth shape as a consequence of the galaxy seds that produce the ebl and second because of the continuity of the cross - section of the pair - production interactions ( @xcite ) . a maximum likelihood method that scans the parameter space",
    "is adopted to compute the likelihood of the estimated data given the different polynomials @xmath35 ( blue crosses in figure  [ fig : e0fits ] ) for each blazar .",
    "the four parameters of the third order polynomial are explored by studying their probability density distributions . at this point ,",
    "three physically motivated assumptions are made .",
    "first , that @xmath46 at @xmath47  tev ; since ebl attenuation is expected to be significantly low at these energies .",
    "second , that @xmath48  ul(@xmath49 ) , where ul is an upper limit calculated in the present work from the ebl upper limits presented in @xcite ; in particular @xmath50  ul(@xmath31 ) at @xmath51  tev . in @xcite two upper limits",
    "are presented coming from a realistic and a weaker assumption on the blazar emission that is called _ extreme _ and that provides the higher upper limits .",
    "extreme _ case is used in our analysis since we want to keep our methodology conservative .",
    "third , we impose that @xmath34 should increase monotonically with energy .",
    "these assumptions will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the @xmath1 value derived from each blazar , for both slow and fast variability timescales , is then estimated from the most likely polynomial in the four dimensional parameter space ( these @xmath1 values are given in each inset of figure  [ fig : e0fits ] and also in table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty is estimated by using a standard jackknife analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final ( combined ) @xmath1 for each blazar is then calculated as the geometric mean value for the two variability timescales values for a given source may initially be spread over a wide energy range .",
    "] we stress that the uncertainties in this value includes the uncertainties derived from the two ssc modelings ( physically the uncertainty in the minimum time variability @xmath25 ) , which are bracketed by the two different predictions of the vhe fluxes . the lower and upper uncertainties of the combined @xmath1 are taken from the @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the state with the lowest and highest @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we stress that these uncertainties are more conservative than @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters that describe the synchrotron / ssc models from the fits to the quasi - simultaneous multiwavelength data are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we provide two different fits to every blazar bracketing the expected intrinsic vhe fluxes .",
    "( these two fits are named slow and fast according to their variability timescale . )",
    "the methodology described in the previous section is applied to every blazar in our catalog . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , pg  1553 + 113 has an uncertain but well constrained redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , two different fits are provided for both redshift limits for this blazar .",
    "figure  [ fig : e0fits ] shows all the fits for the 15 blazars used in our analysis ( two fits per blazar for each minimum variability timescale , except four fits for pg  1553 + 113 to account for its redshift uncertainty ) .",

    "each panel shows the @xmath35 data derived from equation  [ eq : tau ] versus the @xmath54 of the energy in tev .",
    "figure  [ fig : e0fits ] shows the upper limits of the optical depth calculated from the ebl upper limits provided by @xcite and the most likely polynomials .",
    "the @xmath1 value is calculated as the energy where @xmath55 from the most likely polynomial in the maximum likelihood parameter space distribution . for comparison ,",
    "the estimation of @xmath1 calculated from the ebl model based on observations presented by d11 is shown in every panel as a red - dotted line .",

    "the final @xmath1 is then assessed combining the two @xmath1 results ( slow / fast minimum time variability ) from every blazar as the geometric mean value between these two estimates .",
    "the statistical uncertainties bracket the two @xmath1 values from every fit for every blazar with their uncertainties estimated from the maximum likelihood analysis using the likelihood distributions of the polynomial parameters . in our analysis",
    ", we also consider the systematic uncertainties in the lat measurements .",
    "their effect is estimated by artificially hardening and softening the overall seds of pks  2005@xmath18489 ( a blazar with low statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "first , the fluxes of the three lowest - energy lat data for pks  2005@xmath18489 are decreased by 10% ( which is the typical _",
    "fermi_-lat systematic uncertainty of the effective area , @xcite ) and the three highest - energy lat bins are increased in flux by 10% .",
    "the overall sed fit is done with these new points , and the energy where @xmath57 is estimated , using the procedure described in section  [ sec : methodology ] .",
    "this procedure is repeated by increasing by 10% the three lowest - energy lat data of pks  2005@xmath18489 whereas decreasing by 10% the three highest - energy lat data .",
    "this allows us to estimate an average systematic uncertainty of 20% in the energy where @xmath57 for pks  2005@xmath18489 .",
    "we thus assume the systematic uncertainty from the uncertainty in the lat is 20% for all sources . the observed cgrh is shown in figure  [ fig : grh ] with blue circles ,",
    "the statistical uncertainties are shown with darker blue lines , and the statistical plus systematic uncertainties ( added in quadrature ) with lighter blue .",
    "a completely independent estimation of the cgrh from the ebl model described in d11 is also shown with its uncertainties , which are thoroughly discussed in d11 .",
    "the uncertainties in the ebl modeling are larger in the far - ir region for the reasons discussed in d11 .",
    "this leads to the larger uncertainties in the estimation of the cgrh from the ebl modeling at the lower redshifts .",
    "the reason is that this is the ebl region that mainly interacts with the higher - energy vhe photons that lead to determination of the cgrh in that redshift range .",
    "our methodology offers more information on the optical depth than just the cgrh .",
    "therefore , the same procedure followed to calculate the cgrh is applied to calculate the energies at which the optical depth is equal to 0.5 , 2 , and 3 ( shown in figure  [ fig : morecgrh ] with blue squares , green triangles , and magenta diamonds , respectively ) .",
    "the energies for those optical depths are plotted from the d11 model with their uncertainties as well ( the same colors are used for each modeled optical depth as for the data ) .",
    "the uncertainties in these estimates are significantly larger since , in general , they are given by the extrapolation of the most likely polynomial outside the energy range of the cherenkov detections .",
    "in this work , we present an estimation of the cgrh based on a multiwavelength compilation of blazars that includes the most recent _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "we stress that our estimation of the cgrh is derived with only a few physically - motivated constraints .",
    "these results represent a major improvement with respect to previous works .",
    "these previous works provide only lower limits for the cgrh such as the ebl - model dependent limits estimated by @xcite ( that are based on a modified parameterization of the ebl models presented by @xcite ) .",
    "other cgrh limits are presented by @xcite using only _ fermi_-lat observations .    the _ fermi_-lat hard - source catalog ( ackermann et al . , in preparation ) is included in our analysis .",
    "the inclusion of this data set in our multiwavelength blazar catalog is essential for the right estimation of the cgrh since these measurements help to resolve the shape of the inverse compton peak .",
    "the optical depth is calculated using equation  [ eq : tau ] , which describes the ratio between the intrinsic flux from the synchrotron / ssc models and the observed flux by iacts .",
    "then , these data are fitted to polynomials of third order imposing some constraints .",
    "we also require an increasing and monotonic behavior of the polynomials .",
    "polynomials of order lower than three would not reproduce the expected optical depth shape while larger order polynomials would introduce unnecessary parameters into the fits .",
    "the constraints are all physically motivated and ebl - model independent . as we said before",
    ", the first condition is that @xmath58 at @xmath47  tev , which means that the attenuation is rather weak at those low energies .",
    "the second constraint is that @xmath59  ul(@xmath31 ) at @xmath51  tev , where ul are the opacities calculated from the ebl upper limit in the local universe found in @xcite .",
    "the upper limits of their so - called _ extreme _ case are used in our analysis . this _",
    "extreme _ case represents the least constraining assumption on the blazar spectra since it allows us a wider range of spectral indices ( this results in a rather conservative hypothesis for our analysis ) . for this same reason , we prefer to use as conservative upper limits the results by @xcite rather than the newer results by @xcite that are based on a more constraining spectral condition .",
    "the ebl evolution is expected to affect the optical depth calculated at higher redshifts . to account for this effect",
    "we evolve conservatively the ebl upper limits at all wavelengths as @xmath60 ( in the co - moving frame ) when calculating the optical depths from these ebl limits from @xcite .",
    "we note that this is a robust limit given the fact that the maximum evolution ( which is dependent on the wavelength ) is @xmath61 in a realistic model such as d11 for @xmath62 ( the redshift range of our blazar catalog ) .",
    "the third constraint that we apply for our fits is to require only monotonically increasing functions for @xmath35 as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "this condition is also expected for any realistic ebl spectral intensity , which comes from galaxy emission , given the increasing behavior of the pair - production interaction with energy .",
    "interestingly , we see in figure  [ fig : e0fits ] that in most cases the iact observations are indeed detecting the flux decrement given by the cgrh feature ( the cherenkov observations span from negative to positive values of @xmath35 )",
    ".        we find that the cgrh derived from 9 out of 11 blazars where our maximum likelihood methodology can be applied , is compatible with the expected value from the d11 model .",
    "the estimations from other ebl models such as @xcite , @xcite ( model @xmath63 ) , and @xcite are in agreement within uncertainties with the ebl model by d11 .",
    "we note that the fit of 1es  1101@xmath18232 has only one degree of freedom , see table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the uncertainties of the two lowest redshift blazars ( mkn  501 and mkn  421 ) are systematically higher because the optical depth for these cases becomes unity at energies larger than the energies observed by the cherenkov telescopes .",
    "therefore , in these cases @xmath57 is given by an extrapolation of the polynomials rather than an interpolation between observed energies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : e0fits ] ) leading to greater uncertainty . for the case of 1es  2344 + 514 with fast flux variability timescale",
    ", a value of @xmath1 in agreement with the estimation by the d11 ebl model is derived . however , for this case the uncertainties are larger than @xmath1 and therefore no useful constraint can be derived . for the case of 1es  2344 + 514 with slow flux variability timescale ,",
    "the ssc predicted flux is lower than the flux given iact data . for h  1426 + 428 ,",
    "both flux variability timescales give uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath1 larger than @xmath1 and therefore no constraint can be derived .",
    "in both cases the synchrotron / ssc model does not seem to correctly fit the multiwavelength data .",
    "our maximum likelihood procedure can not be applied to any flux state on four blazars ( 1es  1959 + 650 , w  comae , h  2356@xmath18309 and 1es  1011 + 496 ) .",
    "there are different explanations for this fact .",
    "some blazars have shown flux variability on the scale of minutes ( @xcite ) and the iacts tend to detect the sources in higher - flux states . in most cases ,",
    "the lat data are not simultaneous with the iact and other multiwavelength data .",
    "we have tried to alleviate this problem by choosing seds that are based on a low , non flaring state , where the variability seems to be small . in this way",
    "the effects of variability from epoch to epoch have been minimized .",
    "we compare the long - term light curves in x - rays using the quick - look results from the all sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) with the time range of the iact observation for those four blazars where our maximum likelihood procedure could not be applied ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "clearly 1es  1011 + 496 was indeed detected by the iacts in flaring states .",
    "the situation for 1es  1959 + 650 is not clear .",
    "and the light curve of the h  2356@xmath18309 observation was rather irregular .",
    "we could not find x - ray data for w  comae in the asm database but this source was clearly detected in tev in a strong flare ( @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron / ssc model is the standard model for fitting high - peaked tev bl lac objects , and does seem to provide a good fit to their broadband seds ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are some alternatives .",
    "high - peaked bl lac objects are not thought to have a significant contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux from scattering external photon sources , but there are some exceptions , such as the eponymous bl lac ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that for some sources , a lepto - hadronic model provides a better fit , such as 1es  0414 + 009 ( @xcite ) .",
    "non - variable tev emission unrelated to the rest of the broadband sed could originate from compton - scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by an extended jet ( @xcite ) , which would certainly complicate their modeling .",
    "another way of creating non - variable tev emission unrelated to the sed , which would also avoid much of the ebl attenuation , would be if the agn produces a significant number of cosmic rays , which during propagation interact with the cmb and ebl to produce the observed @xmath0-rays ( @xcite ) . finally , even if the synchrotron / ssc model is valid for the tev blazars considered here , it is possible that the electron - positron pairs created by the vhe @xmath0-ray interactions with ebl photons can compton - scatter the cmb , producing @xmath0-rays observable by the lat ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would complicate the modeling process , since it would add other , poorly - constrained parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , the simple synchrotron / ssc is a very attractive model , due to its success at fitting a large number of objects , and its relatively small number of free parameters .",
    "the existence of axion - like particles could also allow the @xmath0-rays to avoid the photoabsorption process , changing the expected vhe spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed broadband modeling including all these non - standard considerations is out of the scope of this work .    in summary",
    ", we built a catalog of 15 blazars from zhang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) by requiring a good multiwavelength spectral coverage and tev detections . after fitting a synchrotron / ssc model to each source",
    ", there were four blazars where the tev detection was at higher fluxes than the flux extrapolation from the models .",
    "as described above , the long - term x - ray data from rxte were checked on the dates of the tev observations for these blazars showing a hint that h  2356@xmath18309 and 1es  1011 + 496 were flaring in x - ray and therefore probably in the tev range as well .",
    "the situation is not clear for 1es  1959 + 650 .",
    "however , as described above potential problems with the synchrotron / ssc model can not be ruled out .",
    "there are two other blazars ( h  1426 + 428 , 1es  2344 + 514 ) for which the uncertainties that we derive for @xmath1 are too high to set any constrain .",
    "this is due to large uncertainties in the tev measurements and/or the low number of tev spectral points , which do not allow a reliable @xmath1 estimation .",
    "the agreement between the cgrh observation presented in this work and the expected values from d11 indicates that these possibilities described above might not be relevant for many blazars .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : morecgrh ] gives more information on the optical - depth shape derived from our methodology .",
    "this figure shows that the energies at which the optical depths are 0.5 , 1 ( the standard definition of cgrh ) , 2 and 3 are still compatible with the d11 model .",
    "the uncertainties are generally higher at @xmath34 different from 1 due to the fact that the cherenkov detections do not span the energy range needed in order to derive a better estimation of those energies .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : e0fits ] , the polynomials cut the horizontal lines of constant optical depths generally in wider energy ranges for @xmath34 values different from 1 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the agreement between the observed cgrh and the expected cgrh from d11 is also consistent with 3c  66a being located at a redshift slightly lower than @xmath64 with 99% confidence . ] and pg  1553 + 113 at @xmath65 .",
    "an independent confirmation of these redshifts will give support to both the current ebl knowledge and our methodology to derive the cgrh . by assuming an ebl model , it is possible to estimate redshifts using ebl attenuation in a realistic way considering the overall sed of the blazars ( see the proceeding by @xcite ) .",
    "however , we note that some previous estimation of the redshift is necessary in order to fit the synchrotron / ssc models ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite claimed that recent ebl models such as d11 are incompatible with iacts observations at more than @xmath66 .",
    "they based their conclusions in an analysis of @xmath67 blazars using two different methods that they call _ method  1 _ and _ method  2_. their more constraining results are derived from method  2 ( see section  3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is based on the expected difference between spectral indexes when the vhe spectrum is fitted by a broken power law .",
    "this spectral difference is attributed to ebl attenuation , setting limits on the intensity of the local ebl .",
    "we consider their results inconclusive .",
    "their method  2 relies on the assumption that the vhe spectra may be well fitted by broken power laws .",
    "we performed f - tests on all the fits of their blazar sample to test whether broken power laws ( fitted by two different spectral indexes ) could be actually considered better fits to the observed vhe spectra than simple power laws ( fitted by a single spectral index ) of the fit due to the inclusion of an additional parameter in the model exceeds the value that can be attributed to random fluctuations in the data ; see @xcite . ]",
    "the f - tests performed for every one of their spectra show that for only 2 out of 12 cases ( rgb  j0152 + 017 and 1es  1101 - 232 ) the spectra can be considered fitted better by broken power laws than simple power laws .",
    "their results from method  1 ( see section  3.1 in @xcite ) are inconclusive as well .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that the vhe intrinsic spectrum is described by a power - law extrapolation of the _",
    "fermi_-lat data points .",
    "as we see in the synchrotron / ssc fits of figure  [ fig : e0fits ] , this is not a realistic assumption due to the shape of the inverse compton peak .",
    "furthermore , we show in the present work that a more sophisticated ssc - based analysis is compatible with the current ebl knowledge .",
    "some authors have treated the _",
    "fermi_-lat spectrum , extrapolated into the vhe regime , as an upper limit on the intrinsic spectrum , and used this to compute upper limits on @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this provides only upper limits on @xmath36 rather than measurements , as we derive here .",
    "however , their techniques involve fewer assumptions about the blazar emission model and variability of the sed ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "thus , the two techniques are complementary .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite claimed the detection of an imprint of the ebl in the blazar spectra .",
    "@xcite base their analysis on _ fermi_-lat data from @xmath68 to 1.6 , whereas @xcite use h.e.s.s .",
    "data from blazars located at @xmath69 .",
    "these works do not give any results in terms of the cgrh but we are able to estimate it from their results .",
    "we find that the results presented in our analysis are compatible with the results from these two independent works , which supports our conclusions .    from our results",
    ", we can conclude that the ebl data from direct detection by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are likely contaminated by zodiacal light .",
    "this possibility has indirectly been proposed previously by several authors such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using ebl upper limits but we confirm these results using a more robust approach .",
    "the cgrh horizon is detected in this work for the first time from a multiwavelength sample of blazars that includes the more recent _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "only a few general and physically motivated constraints on the ebl were necessary . as we see from our analysis",
    "the observational estimation of the cgrh is compatible within uncertainties with the derivation by the observational ebl model described by @xcite , which is in agreement with the observational ebl model by @xcite and the theoretical methodology followed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all these ebl models are realistic representations of the current knowledge of the ebl ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown the ability of our methodology to study the opacity of the universe at different redshifts and to infer distances of blazars with unknown redshifts .",
    "our methodology is sensitive to the total ebl , which includes light even from the faintest and most distant galaxies in the universe .",
    "this will allow us to set limits on the faint - end slope of the evolving galaxy luminosity function , which still remains controversial ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of the cgrh presented here will provide an independent test for cosmology and for the estimation of the cosmological parameters that will be presented in domnguez & prada ( submitted ) .",
    "our technique will benefit in the future with the improved statistics that _ fermi _ will provide .",
    "the future cherenkov telescope array is expected to provide vhe spectra with a better energy resolution , observed up to higher energies , and increase considerably the number of sources , which indeed will improve the cgrh determination .",
    "these prospects together with the increasing number of simultaneous multiwavelength observational campaigns ( @xcite ) are promising for a better estimation of the optical depths due to ebl attenuation using our methodology and for the estimation of the cgrh to @xmath70 .",
