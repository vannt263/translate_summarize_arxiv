    "a scattering experiment , using neutrons or x - rays for example , is one of the most direct measures of the structure of materials .",
    "naively , this comes about because in the born approximation , which usually applies for x - rays and neutrons , the intensity in scattering measurements is proportional to the fourier transform of a density - density correlation function .",
    "it is the wavelike properties of the scattering probe which produces the fourier transform . for",
    "a deeper understanding of the relationship between scattering intensity and structure one must realize that this direct correspondence applies precisely only for coherent waves .",
    "indeed , for conventional sources , a given point in the incident wave is only coherent within a small volume of neighboring points .",
    "this coherence volume has transverse dimensions determined by how parallel the wavefronts are and a longitudinal length determined by how monochromatic the wave is . in a standard scattering experiment the different coherence regions of the incident beam scatter independently .",
    "the intensity measured thus depends on an incoherent average over different regions of the scattering volume . by restricting the scattering volume of the sample to less than the coherence volume of the beam",
    ", one can eliminate this incoherent average , and thus learn more about the material s structure .",
    "of course , the experimental difficulty which arises is to obtain sufficient diffracted intensity to measure a signal .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that coherent diffraction experiments can be performed with x - rays using high - brilliance synchrotron sources@xcite . for coherent diffraction",
    ", the scattering from an inhomogeneous material displays a characteristic speckled scattering pattern .",
    "for instance , the random distribution of phase - ordering domains shown in fig .  1 and discussed below , results in the speckle pattern shown in fig",
    ".  2 . as the domains change shape , the speckle pattern changes , and this time dependence of the speckle offers a unique method for studying the evolution of inhomogeneous materials .    motivated by these advances in experimental techniques ,",
    "we have undertaken a theoretical study of intensity fluctuations caused by scattering from a nonequilibrium system undergoing phase ordering by domain growth . when a disordered homogeneous material is rapidly brought to a new set of conditions , corresponding to the coexistence of two equilibrium phases , a spatial pattern of domains of the two phases develops @xcite .",
    "this change of conditions is often accomplished by a rapid quench from a high temperature to a low one below a miscibility gap .",
    "the quench from a homogeneous state with local fluctuations creates a microstructure of interconnecting , interlocking domains through the kinetics of a first - order phase transition .",
    "as time goes on the domains grow , so as to minimize the area of the domain walls that separate the phases .    when the average domain size @xmath9 at time @xmath1 is large compared to all other relevant lengths , except for the extent @xmath10 of the system itself",
    ", the system looks invariant if all lengths are measured in units of that domain size . in this case",
    "the structure of these many domains is said to `` scale '' with @xmath9 .",
    "experimentally , the growing domain structure is often studied by means of the scattering intensity @xcite , whose width is proportional to the inverse of @xmath9 . when the average scattering intensity is scaled in units of this time - dependent length ,",
    "one obtains the scattering function for late times in the form of a time - independent scaling function .",
    "the time - dependence then enters only through @xmath9 , which can typically be described in terms of an exponent @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",
    "this scaling hypothesis has been found to apply to a large range of systems , and to be unaffected by many of the microscopic details of specific materials .",
    "that is , the scaling function and the growth exponent @xmath11 are two features which are common to a large number of systems , collectively called a universality class .",
    "universality classes for phase ordering by domain growth are delineated chiefly by the presence or absence of conservation laws .",
    "indeed , many aspects of this nonequilibrium process can be described by relatively simple theoretical models .",
    "for example , for systems described by a nonconserved scalar order parameter , often called model a @xcite , the growth exponent is found to be @xmath13 .",
    "systems included in this class are the ising model with spin - flip dynamics , binary alloys undergoing an order - disorder transition , and some magnetic materials with uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "model b @xcite refers to systems in which the scalar order parameter is conserved , and the only growth mechanism is diffusion .",
    "systems in this universality class have @xmath14 and include the conserved ising model , as well as binary alloys undergoing phase separation .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the time - dependent fluctuations _ around _ this scaling behavior , and we demonstrate how to study these fluctuations experimentally through analysis of the time - dependent scattering .",
    "the first theoretical study of such behavior is given in ref .",
    "the scattering intensity is related to the fourier transform of the order parameter @xmath15 , the scalar field describing the inhomogeneity of a specific sample of the scattering material , by @xmath16 where we ignore the proportionality constant for convenience .",
    "the average of @xmath17 over an ensemble of initial conditions is the structure factor , @xmath18 here , the ensemble average expresses the distinction between coherent scattering , given by @xmath19 , and incoherent scattering , given by @xmath20 .",
    "fluctuations around the average scattering are the main topic of interest in this paper .",
    "the structure factor can also be expressed as the fourier transform of the correlation function of @xmath15 , @xmath21 because of these relationships , the scattering intensity and structure factor have been important tools for studying the dynamics of materials far from equilibrium . if a system is isotropic , then its average scattering properties depend only on the magnitude of the scattering wavevector , @xmath22 .",
    "as mentioned above , scaling by the domain size @xmath12 implies that correlations are time independent when measured in units of @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , for an isotropic system , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is one form of the scaling function .",
    "fourier transformation gives the average scattering intensity in terms of another form of the scaling function , which depends only on a _ scaled _ time @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spatial dimension of the scattering material .",
    "the specific form of @xmath29 depends on the dynamic universality class .    as discussed above , when the scattering involves _ coherent _ radiation , @xmath17",
    "is directly measured without self - averaging .",
    "the scattering from an inhomogeneous material displays a characteristic speckled scattering pattern much like the one in fig .  2 , which shows the squared norm of the fourier transform of the configuration in fig .  1",
    "the intensity of each speckle in @xmath30 is due to correlations in the inhomogeneous sample , and @xmath31 gives the fluctuations around the average scattering intensity .    for materials in equilibrium , deviations of @xmath19 around the structure factor are induced by thermal fluctuations in @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , fluctuations in the speckle patterns from scattered laser light have been used as the standard basis of photon correlation experiments at wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet to the infrared @xcite . with the advent of high - brilliance synchrotron photon sources , experiments involving coherent x - rays have become possible .",
    "for example , brownian diffusion rates in gold colloids have been determined from the time required for a change in an x - ray speckle pattern @xcite .",
    "speckle from coherent x - rays has also been used to study equilibrium fluctuations in fe@xmath33al near an order - disorder transition @xcite , and in micellar block - copolymer systems @xcite .",
    "x - rays can probe materials on much smaller length scales than is currently possible with lasers , and their greater penetration allows the study of optically opaque materials .",
    "in the present paper , we present a theoretical study of fluctuations in the scattering intensity from a nonequilibrium system undergoing phase ordering by domain growth . for such systems",
    "the intensity fluctuates around a time - dependent structure factor @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the intensity at a specific wavevector for one particular quench can be normalized by the average behavior .",
    "a typical example of such a normalized time series , obtained from a simulation at zero temperature , is presented in fig .",
    "it is the correlations of such time series , averaged over many individual speckles and quenches , that can be used to study the pattern formation process in phase - ordering materials .    in fig .",
    "3 we also show a `` brownian '' function which was constructed to have the same single - time probability density and an exponential two - time covariance with the same characteristic time as the normalized nonequilibrium scattering intensity . qualitative differences are immediately evident in the two time series .",
    "the brownian function fluctuates quickly , with large amplitude variations , while the intensity fluctuations produced by the phase - ordering system vary slowly , with markedly less variation in amplitude on short time scales @xcite .",
    "this property of the nonequilibrium intensity fluctuations is called persistence @xcite , and it indicates a qualitative difference between the two - time correlation functions for the two processes @xcite .    for the remainder of this paper , we specialize to model a as a simple model for systems undergoing phase ordering following a quench through a second - order order  disorder phase transition .",

    "[ sec : theory ] below , which give them to be 1 and @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "however , the connection to theory requires some further justification , given in the following section .",
    "while experiments can measure time correlations readily through the covariance or the correlation of intensities , cov or corr , theories to date have made use of the two - point , two - time order - parameter correlation function , @xmath127 . in this section",
    "we argue for , and empirically demonstrate , equality between the intensity covariance for @xmath128 , which involves fourth moments of the order parameter , and the square of the spatial fourier transform of the two - time order - parameter correlation function in our model .",
    "the relationship is exact when @xmath129 is a joint gaussian random number , with its real and imaginary parts independent and gaussian , as we will show below .",
    "however , establishing @xmath130 to be approximately gaussian in the present case is not trivial .",
    "gaussian variables are a natural consequence of the central - limit theorem , which requires a large number of uncorrelated contributions to the variable ( with some restrictions on the properties of the individual contributions ) .",
    "for example , in a disordered system in equilibrium , correlations exist only on the scale of a small length @xmath131 , so a system of edge - length @xmath10 consists of on the order of @xmath132 independent , uncorrelated parts .",
    "then the central - limit theorem applies , and @xmath129 is a complex , gaussian variable . for an ordered system in equilibrium , this argument applies to the fluctuations around the ordered state .",
    "the present nonequilibrium situation has some rough analogies to a disordered equilibrium state . at a given time , the average domain size is @xmath9 , and so the number of independent parts at a given time is approximately @xmath133 , which can be large .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to expect the central - limit theorem to apply , and indeed , we find empirically that @xmath129 is gaussian .",
    "however , unlike a disordered system , the distribution of domains of different sizes is broad in this case due to the initial long - wavelength instability and , furthermore , it is clear that domains interact as they grow . the degree to which this correlation is important is a nontrivial issue ; below , we test it numerically and find these correlations to be negligible for the two - point quantities of interest in this work .    if @xmath129 is gaussian , it is straightforward to relate the intensity covariance @xmath134 to the order - parameter correlation function @xmath135 .",
    "wick s theorem can be used to decompose the intensity - intensity average as @xmath136 here @xmath137 is the two - time structure factor corresponding to the two - point , two - time order - parameter correlation function @xmath138 for @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : correspond ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath139 which equates the speckle intensity covariance with the square of the two - time structure factor of the system .",
    "finally , the scaling ansatz defines a universal two - time form @xmath140 and @xmath141    our numerical tests show that this equality holds well in these simulations for @xmath142 . in computer simulations , unlike scattering experiments , the two - time structure factor can be found directly using eq .",
    "( [ eq : skt1t2 ] ) . generally , the product @xmath143 is a complex number , but the mean value of the imaginary part is zero , so the two - time structure factor is real valued . in our simulation data , the imaginary part of @xmath144 is found to be zero , within our accuracy .",
    "results for the real part at @xmath145 and @xmath146 are presented on a log - log scale in fig .",
    "the direct measurements of the two - time structure factor and the square - root of the intensity covariance agree quite well , except at very large values of @xmath147 , where lattice effects are important .",
    "another consequence of our proposed decoupling , leading to the relationship between @xmath134 and @xmath20 , can be tested by simulation . when @xmath81 , eq .",

    "these are compared in fig .  7 , where the agreement is clearly quite good . as an aside , since the variance does not depend on the system size , eq .",
    "( [ eq : var ] ) demonstrates that @xmath17 is a spatially non - self - averaging quantity @xcite .",

    "still , less than @xmath162 of the points lie this far into the tail , and the deviation is inferred to be a finite - size effect because it becomes more pronounced as our simulation continues .",
    "this agrees with earlier simulations @xcite , in which increasing the system size eliminated the deviation .",
