    "recently , there has been a good deal of interest in the study of sea quarks ,  both in theory and experiment .  in such studies ,",
    "strange quarks play an important role in observables involving sea quarks .  for more than a decade ,",
    "intensive studies have been made in measuring and understanding the strangeness contribution to the nucleon spin  @xcite , the electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , the strangeness condensate  @xcite , and the parton distribution function in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of studying strangeness content is to address the issue of the _ nutev anomaly_.  the nutev experiment ( @xmath14 )  @xcite , which measures the weinberg angle or weak mixing angle ,  an important parameter in the standard model of particle physics , finds a value which is three standard deviations away from the world average value .",
    "one suggestion to explain this discrepancy is the asymmetry in strange and anti - strange parton distribution  @xcite ,  a non - perturbative effect .",
    "attempts by various theoretical models to calculate the asymmetry give inconsistent results ( sometimes with completely opposite signs )  @xcite",
    ".  also , phenomenological extractions by cteq and nutev  @xcite for leading order and next - to - leading order give different results .",
    "lattice qcd can assess this asymmetry from first principles in terms of @xmath15 to address whether it is strange or anti - strange which is leading in large @xmath16 .",
    "this information will be helpful to constrain and analyze the experimental data .  similarly ,  the first moment of the strange parton distribution ,  @xmath17 is not well known .",
    "it ranges between 0.018 and 0.04 from the fitting of parton distribution functions to experiments  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ",  we will study the first and second moments of quark distribution for up ,  down and strange quarks .",
    "the first moment provides the measure of the symmetric contribution from parton and anti - parton distributions ( @xmath18 ) and the second moment provides the measure of the asymmetry in parton and anti - parton distributions ( @xmath19).these moments have contributions both from connected and disconnected insertions for up and down quarks and only disconnected insertion for strange quarks .  since lattice calculations on connected insertions ,  for the first and second moments ,",
    "have been done before ,  this work is going to focus mainly on disconnected insertion contributions ( particularly for strange quarks ) to the first and second moments ,  which has not been attempted in lattice qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give the formalism and lattice operators in sec .",
    "the disconnected insertion calculation is presented in sec .",
    "the perturbative renormalization is given in sec .",
    "v presents numerical parameters and error studies of the noise estimate .",
    "the results for both the disconnected insertions and connected insertions are given in sec .",
    "finally , we offer a conclusion and some discussion in sec .",
    "some details of the three - point correlation functions are given in the appendices .",
    "in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite , it is useful to consider and analyze the moments of the structure function via the operator product expansion ( ope ) where , in the limit of distance @xmath20 or equivalently @xmath21 , the product of two operators can be expanded in terms of local operators where @xmath22 s are the wilson coefficients .",
    "the leading term for such an expansion has the lowest _ twist _ ,",
    "@xmath23 .  for unpolarized structure functions with vector currents @xmath24",
    ",  the twist - two operators for quarks have the bilinear form where @xmath25 denotes the quark field operator for the flavor @xmath26,@xmath27,and @xmath28 stands for symmetrization of the indices ,  @xmath29 s .",
    "the subtracted trace terms are proportional to @xmath30 ,  so that the operator is traceless on all pairs of indices .    in the leading twist ,",
    "the moments of structure functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be written as where @xmath33 is defined through the forward matrix elements in the parton model , @xmath33 has the interpretation as the @xmath34th moment of the momentum fraction carried by the quarks with flavor @xmath26 at some scale @xmath29 , i.e. where @xmath35 is the quark distribution function and @xmath36 is the anti - quark distribution function for the flavor @xmath26 .",
    "we see that the first moment ( @xmath37 ) has the symmetric combination of the quark and anti - quark distribution and the second moment ( @xmath38 ) , due to the interference between the vector and axial - vector part of the weak interaction current , has the asymmetric combination of the quark and anti - quark distribution .",
    "our goal is to compute the first and second moments for up ,  down , and strange quarks .",
    "lattice calculations are carried out in euclidean path - integral .",
    "thus , we need to transform the twist - two operators from minkowski space to euclidean space .  following the convention  @xcite with the @xmath39 matrices defined as we can transform the twist - two operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operator_min ] ) to its euclidean counterpart by using the notation  @xcite where  @xmath40 and @xmath41.we have also set @xmath42 for any four vector ,  @xmath43 .  from now on we will consider euclidean operators only and",
    "drop the superscript ,  @xmath44 .  since the euclidean signature is ( + + + + ) ,   the subtracted trace terms are proportional to @xmath45 . to be specific",
    ", we use the pauli - sakurai @xmath39 matrix convention in our calculation .",
    "we discretize our current operators by using the following relations for right and left derivatives in lattice  @xcite where @xmath43 is the lattice spacing .",
    "for example ,  the two - index operator ,  @xmath46 ,  can be written as where @xmath47 for @xmath48 ;  @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for the three - index operators .    since in lattice",
    "qcd the continuous space - time space is described on a four - dimensional cubic lattice , the @xmath53 group in the continuum reduces to the hyper - cubic group @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "this implies that operators belonging to irreducible representations of @xmath53 may transform in a reducible way under @xmath54 .",
    "this will allow them to mix with lower dimensional operators under renormalization . in order to avoid such mixing ,",
    "it is suggested to adopt the following combination of operators which have minimal mixing ( or no mixing )  @xcite.for two - index operators ( for @xmath0 ) , we choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 which does not suffer from any mixing  @xcite .",
    "the best choice for three - index operator ( for @xmath1 ) is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ) , which still suffers from some mixing  @xcite.the matrix elements for these operators are where the @xmath59 factor , with @xmath60 being the nucleon mass , is due to the normalization of the spinors with @xmath61 .",
    "the proton two - point function we use ( with the color indices suppressed ) is where @xmath62 is the nucleon sink time ,  and @xmath63 is the momentum of the nucleon .",
    "the interpolating fields  @xcite we use are where @xmath64 and @xmath65 stand for up and down quarks ,  respectively .",
    "@xmath66 ,  is the charge conjugation operator with the pauli - sakurai @xmath39 matrices .",

    "the greek letters ,  @xmath69 ,  @xmath70 , ... ,  are the spin indices .",
    "since we are interested only in nucleon with @xmath71 , we use the projection operator @xmath72@xcite to eliminate the contamination from negative parity @xmath73 state . here",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are the mass and energy of the @xmath73 state . after applying the projection operator",
    ", we get the two - point function as where the superscript @xmath76 represents positive ( negative ) parity states and @xmath77 being the number of lattice points .    as a result ,",
    "the projected two - point function with momentum @xmath63 at large time separation , i.e. @xmath78 ,  will filter out the excited states , leaving only the nucleon state remaining asymptotically where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the nucleon mass and energy ,  respectively .",

    "[ connected_fig ] .",
    "it needs to be stressed that it is not a feynman diagram in perturbation theory .",
    "we see that the nucleon interpolating quark fields contract with the quark fields of the current so that the quark lines flow continuously from @xmath86 at the nucleon source to @xmath84 at the nucleon sink .",
    "this is termed the _ connected insertion _",
    "( c.i . ) .",
    "the _ quark line disconnected _ part is represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ disconnected_fig ] .  in this case",
    ",  we see that the quark fields in the current self contract to form a loop , which is disconnected from the nucleon interpolating quark fields with regard to their quark lines .",
    "this is termed the _ disconnected insertion _",
    "( d.i . ) .",
    "since the quarks are propagating in the gauge background , if we were to consider a similar situation in terms of feynman diagrams in the perturbative approach , it would involve gluon lines between the quark loop and the nucleon propagator so that the corresponding feynman diagrams are _ connected _ in this sense .",
    "indeed the corresponding disconnected feynman diagrams are subtracted as the uncorrelated part in the definition of the _ disconnected insertion _",
    "i.e. where @xmath90 is the nucleon interpolation field . in the literature",
    ", this disconnected insertion is sometimes referred to as the `` disconnected diagram '' which can cause some confusion .    the computation of the c.i .",
    "is relatively straight forward .",
    "we shall use the sequential source technique  @xcite to calculate it .",
    "this fixes the source point @xmath91 and the sink time slice @xmath92.however , the computation of the d.i .",
    "poses a major numerical challenge.the d.i . contains not only the usual propagators from the source ,  @xmath93 ,  to any point ,  @xmath16 ,  but also the propagators from any insertion position ( @xmath94 ) to any other lattice points .",
    "this amounts to inverting the fermion matrix at each point of the lattice to construct the _ all - to - all _ propagators .",
    "this entails inversion of a million by million ( @xmath95 ) sparse matrix on a @xmath96 lattice ( 3 and 4 are number of color and spin indices ) for each gauge configuration .",
    "this is unattainable even by using the computing powers of today s supercomputers .  instead",
    ",  we shall calculate with the stochastic method .",
    "specifically , we adopt the complex @xmath3 noise for the estimation with unbiased subtraction .",
    "the detailed description of the method and the usefulness of discrete symmetries will be presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : discretesymmetries ] .      in order to extract @xmath97 and @xmath98,we take the suitable ratios of the three - point to two - point correlation functions.since ,  for the case of c.i .",
    ",  the nucleon sink time is fixed , and for the case of d.i . ,  the sink time is not fixed ,  the procedures for extracting the matrix elements ,  after taking the ratios ,  are different for the two cases .      in view of the fact that the matrix elements of @xmath99 between the equal momentum nucleon states , are proportional to @xmath100 , and that of @xmath101 are proportional to @xmath102 , and that the momentum projection is folded in the sequential source at the sink time @xmath92 in the connected insertion calculation , we have chosen only one momentum for the nucleon to be @xmath103 ( the lowest available non - zero momentum ) along the @xmath16 direction in order to reduce the computational cost .",
    "after inserting complete sets of physical states between the interpolation fields and the operators @xmath83 , we arrive at the asymptotic relations for the following ratios of three- to two - point functions at @xmath104 @xmath105 : in practice , one takes a plateau in the insertion time ,  @xmath106 , to define the asymptotic region .",
    "similarly ,  we get for the other two operators and      as seen from fig .",
    "[ disconnected_fig ] , the calculation of the valence quark propagators in the disconnected insertion is separate from the loop calculation in each configuration ; this means that the momentum in the three - point function can be chosen in the nucleon two - point functions independent of the expensive loop calculation .",
    "for the present calculation , we choose @xmath107 for the three - point function for the cases of @xmath108 and @xmath101 , and zero momentum for @xmath109 .",
    "in contrast to c.i . ,  the sink time need not be fixed in d.i .",
    "we can sum over the insertion time to gain more statistics  @xcite .",
    "there are various methods by which the summation is performed  @xcite .",
    "all these methods , except in  @xcite , considered summation over insertion time up to or beyond sink time . from appendix  [ app :",

    "( it may not be zero for other operators .",
    "even then it will not contribute to the physical quantity intended to be measured ) .",
    "so the summation outside the nucleon source and sink times will contribute to unnecessary noise and possible contribution from higher states which are unrelated to the target matrix element .",
    "also , at the source and sink time it can have contributions from the contact term . in view of the above , we shall take the sum to be from ( source time @xmath112 ) to ( sink time @xmath113 )  @xcite .  according to the derivations in appendix  [ appsubsec : threept_ratio_di ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ ratio_disconnected ] ) ) ,  under the condition @xmath114 ,  we get for the operator @xmath108    similarly ,  for the other two operators ,  we get    and",
    "the d.i . calculation is the most numerically intensive part .",
    "we shall discuss the various aspects of the calculation in more detail .      since the d.i .",
    "calculations are performed by using a stochastic noise estimator ,  the signals for the current loop are always noisy .",
    "we can reduce the errors by making good use of some of the discrete symmetries , specifically parity , @xmath115 hermiticity , and charge-@xmath115 hermiticity ( @xmath116 transformation )  @xcite .    by applying these symmetries and transformations ,  one can then work out the effects of gauge averaging in order to find out the correct part ( e.g.  even or odd parity ,  real or imaginary part , etc . ) of the two - point and three - point correlation functions ,  current operators etc .",
    ", and discard the irrelevant part .      since in the case of d.i .",
    "the three - point functions are constructed by multiplying the nucleon propagator with the current loop in each gauge configuration ( fig .  [ disconnected_fig]),we have the advantage of taking into account nucleons propagators with equal and opposite momenta in order to increase statistics .",
