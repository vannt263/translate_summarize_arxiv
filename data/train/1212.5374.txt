    "reversal  ( tr ) is a waveform transmission method that focuses the transmitted energy in dispersive  @xcite .",
    "it utilizes channel reciprocity and obtains the channel state information by sending a probing signal .",
    "the backscattered signal is then time - reversed and retransmitted .",
    "the tr signal is shown to be optimal in the sense that the transmission realizes a matched filter to the propagation transfer function  @xcite .",
    "the concept of  tr was originally developed for optical and acoustic applications , and it is recently introduced as a detection technique in the electromagnetic domain  @xcite , where the target to be detected is embedded in stationary random multipath scatterers .    in  @xcite , the authors assumed that the multipath channel or the channel response signal can be ideally estimated using probing snapshots .",
    "however , the assumption of a perfectly known channel or a noise - free signal may not be realistic for practical systems due to e.g. measurement noise .",
    "estimation accuracy depends on the number of snapshots , which is limited by the coherence time / frequency of the channel , and the sampling rate of the system  @xcite . to avoid channel estimation ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite considered a blind  tr detector , which utilizes only the distribution of the multipath channels .",
    "the likelihood ratio test for the tr detector was derived assuming statistical independence between the two consecutive transmissions . however , this assumption is not valid if the transmissions are within the coherence time of the multipath channel . using existing detectors in such a scenario will induce performance loss .    despite the practical needs to understand tr detection in the presence of channel correlation , the results in this direction are scarce . to address this challenge",
    ", we propose a blind tr detector that admits a general correlation structure between the tr channels .",
    "a closed - form approximation to the corresponding likelihood ratio is proposed using the multivariate edgeworth expansion .",
    "the approximation is constructed via the derived exact moments of the underlying statistics .",
    "numerical simulations show that the proposed detector outperforms the detector in  @xcite by exploiting the tr channel correlations .",
    "we consider blind detection of a point target in the presence of multipath scatterers as studied in  @xcite .",
    "the detection system sends @xmath0 probing signals in the spectral domain at the frequencies @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the sampling frequencies are chosen such that each frequency bin is separated by the coherence bandwidth of the channel and the spectral samples are statistically independent .",
    "the multipath channel at @xmath1 induced by the scatterers is modeled by a wide sense stationary process .",
    "we denote the channels experienced by the probing signal and the retransmission as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the channel response of the point target is captured by a deterministic response  @xmath5 and the probing signal at @xmath1 is denoted as @xmath6 .",
    "note that here we consider a general correlation structure between @xmath3 and @xmath4 instead of statistical independence assumed in  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "knowledge of channel coherence time is no longer required .",
    "in such a scenario , the detector of  @xcite suffers performance loss as will be shown in section  [ sec_result ] .    after transmitting the probing signal  @xmath6",
    ", we write the frequency response as@xmath7 where @xmath8 is the measurement noise which is distributed as a zero - mean complex gaussian random variable with power spectral density  ( psd )  @xmath9 . hereafter , we denote  @xmath10  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a white probing signal such that @xmath11 with a transmit power @xmath12 .",
    "the received signal  @xmath13 is then time - reversed or , equivalently , phase - conjugated in the frequency domain and scaled to obtain the tr signal ,  , where @xmath14 is a energy normalization factor . the value of @xmath15 is shown to be approximately deterministic with a relatively small variance compared to its expected value  @xcite .",
    "the tr signal @xmath16 is subsequently transmitted and the channel response of the retransmission is calculated by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the measurement noise of the retransmission . in blind tr detection , the channels @xmath3 and @xmath4 will not be estimated by the detector and are only known by their statistical distributions .",
    "therefore , a hypothesis test can be formulated as follows : in the null hypothesis  @xmath21 , the target is not present and @xmath22 ; in the alternative hypothesis  @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the channels @xmath3 and @xmath4 admit a bivariate zero - mean complex gaussian distribution with a common psd  @xmath25 .",

    "the channel statistics can be estimated by taking snapshots of channel samples and replacing the statistical expectation by the sample mean .",
    "the measurement noise  @xmath8 and @xmath29 are independent of each other and the multipath channels .",
    "if we ignore the noise term  @xmath29 in  ( [ eq_ztr ] ) , @xmath30 is distributed as the product of two complex gausian random variables with @xmath31 by definition , the random variables  @xmath32 and  @xmath33 are jointly complex gaussian distributed with a correlation coefficient calculated as@xmath34    to clarify the considered problem , we introduce the random variable  @xmath35 and denote its corresponding pdf in the complex plane as  @xmath36 .",
