    "it is well known that symmetries play a key role in modern physics and have a direct relation with universality hypothesis .",
    "the power of universality ideas comes from the fact that they relate the critical properties of a gauge theory in ( @xmath0 ) space - time dimensions to those of a classical scalar field theory ( or spin system ) in @xmath1 spatial dimensions and allow predictions of critical indices in theories with continuous phase transitions .",
    "the lattice gauge theory with one - parameter representation of the action was introduced by wilson  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the usual plaquette variable , the product of link gauge fields @xmath4 around a plaquette .",
    "the critical behavior of this model depends on the dimensionality and the gauge group and includes both first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "the enlarged lattice gauge actions involving new double plaquette interaction terms were proposed and studied in @xmath5 and @xmath6 by edgar  @xcite , bhanot  et al  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 version of one of these lattice gauge models with z(2 ) gauge symmetry formulated on the planar rectangular windows was investigated by turban  @xcite .",
    "this model with pure gauge action had been reduced to the usual spin-@xmath8 ising model on the square lattice and the point of a second - order phase transition was found .",
    "in our paper we constructed the z(3 ) gauge model on the flat triangular and square lattices with double plaquette ( window ) representation of the action .",
    "the choice of this mixed action allowed us to connect it with the hamiltonian of the spin-1 beg model  @xcite and receive the line of the second - order phase transition .",

    "this model exhibits a rich critical behavior including the first- as well as second - order phase transitions and reflects interesting phenomena connected with real physical systems such as the phase separation in @xmath13 mixture , multicomponent fluids , microemulsions and so on .",
    "its phase diagrams have been investigated by means of mean - field  @xcite , renormalization group  @xcite and other approximations .",
    "the exact results have been obtained on the honeycomb  @xcite and on the bethe  @xcite lattices .    as to the exact result on the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "it is limited to the certain subspace of the exchange - interaction constants @xmath14 this condition permits to map the beg model to the usual spin-@xmath8 ising model and get the @xmath15-line of the second - order phase transition .",
    "in our previous paper  @xcite we solved the beg model with condition  ( [ horig ] ) on the bethe lattice and found the tricritical point of the second - order phase transition for the lattices with coordination number greater than 6 .",
    "now it is interesting to apply the results obtained for the beg model to the gauge theory , because of the deep interrelation between spin and gauge lattice models .",
    "the model is considered on the flat triangular and square lattices in terms of the bond variables @xmath16 which take their values in the z(3 ) , the group of the third roots of unity .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the product of @xmath16 s around an elementary plaquette @xmath11 .",
    "the action of the model is @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 the first summation is over all nearest - neighbor plaquettes and the second one is over all plaquettes of the lattice , @xmath21 .    introducing spin variables",

    "we have the phase transition from the ordered ( z(2 ) broken ) phase which corresponds to confinement to the disordered one , since confinement in the gauge theory corresponds to ordering in the spin system .",
    "these transitions belong to the ising type and whence they have the same critical exponents .",
    "we constructed the z(3 ) gauge lattice model with double plaquette ( window ) representation of the action and showed that this model is dual to the spin-1 beg one . using the exact solution of the beg model on the honeycomb lattice and the solution obtained by the free - fermion approximation technique on the square lattice we found the lines of the second - order phase transition .",
    "the constructed action gives possibility to transform the z(3 ) gauge theory defined on the generalized bethe lattice of plaquettes  @xcite to the beg model on the usual bethe lattice for which the exact solution was obtained  @xcite and receive exact expressions for the multicritical points and construct phase diagrams .",
