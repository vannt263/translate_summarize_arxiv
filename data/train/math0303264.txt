    "the rank two examples were worked out in @xcite . for the cases of @xmath106 and @xmath107 the above system of inequalities was not minimal . for the case of @xmath108",
    "there was one trivially redundant inequality .",
    "once it was removed the remaining inequalities were irredundant . for the case of @xmath107 there were no trivially redundant inequalities but three redundant inequalities .",

    "another interesting consequence is that although the polyhedral cones @xmath111 and @xmath112 are isomorphic ( i.e. , there is an affine isomorphism from one to the other ) by theorem [ transfer ] , the systems of inequalities are different .    in chapter 3 , see theorem [ realization ] , we have given a self - contained account of how one uses the demazure  b.g.g .",
