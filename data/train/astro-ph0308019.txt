    "the mystery of the physical cause of amplitude - modulation in certain rr lyrae stars , popularly known as the `` blazhko effect '' remains despite almost a century of study . in a previous paper in this series ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter a00 ) we discussed the results of the frequency analysis of a sample of 1350 large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) variables , formerly classified as first overtone rr  lyrae ( rr1 ) stars .",
    "in addition to the discovery of more than one hundred double - mode variables , we found 52 stars which displayed long - period amplitude and phase modulations . until very recently ( olech , kauny & thompson 2001 , and references therein ; cseresnjes 2001 ; moskalik & poretti 2003 ; soszyski et al .",
    "2003 ) it was established as a well - observed phenomenon only among fundamental - mode variables .",
    "the study of a00 gave the first reliable statistics on the incidence rate of this behavior among rr1 stars .",
    "a rate of 4% was found which is surprisingly low compared with the most often referenced rate of 2030% for the fundamental mode ( rr0 ) stars ( szeidl 1988 ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to verify whether this large difference does indeed exist between these two groups of stars .",
    "the large and homogeneous sample of the macho database stars used in this study yield much more significant results for the global statistical properties of this population than any other existing investigation which were typically based on very limited and inhomogeneous samples of objects from various stellar systems .",
    "( exceptions to this characterization are the surveys of soszyski et al .",
    "2003 on the 7612 rr  lyrae stars of the lmc from the ogle - ii database , of moskalik & poretti 2003 for the 215 variables of the galactic bulge from the ogle - i database and of cseresnjes 2001 for the 3700 variables of the fornax dwarf galaxy . )",
    "apart from the task of identification of the variable type for rr  lyrae in the lmc macho database , we also study the global properties of the blazhko stars and compare them with their singly - periodic counterparts .",
    "a key discriminant between rival explanations for the blazhko behavior is found in the predicted frequency and amplitude pattern distributions of the amplitude spectra of these stars .",
    "the existence ( or non - existence ) of triplet or quintuplet structures and the degree of asymmetry of the corresponding modulation amplitudes strongly restricts the range of acceptable models .",
    "the present large dataset enables us to put significant constraints on the possible ranges of the various modulation components .",
    "a brief summary of the results obtained by this analysis of a fraction of the present dataset has already been published by welch et al .",
    "the dataset analyzed in this paper comprises 6391 light curves selected from the macho database as variables satisfying certain conditions on brightness , color and period , corresponding to the expected properties of fundamental mode rr  lyrae stars in the lmc . due to overlapping fields , 364 light curves turned out to represent variables already appearing in the database with other identification numbers .",
    "since these double ( or multiple ) identifications decrease the number of stars in each variable type by only a few percent , and therefore , does not influence the incidence rates in a significant way , all of our subsequent results and statistics refer to the full sample of 6391 identifications .",
    "the list of stars with multiple identifications is presented at the end of this section .",
    "this paper analyzes rr lyrae stars identified in 30 lmc macho project fields ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 47 , 53 , 55 , 57 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 ) .",
    "these fields include 54% of the observed stars in all fields because they cover the densely populated bar of the lmc ( see the home page of the macho project ) .",
    "the data utilized span a period of 2700  d ( 7.4  yr ) , which is 1  yr longer than the timebase of the first overtone rr  lyrae stars analyzed in a00 .",
    "the magnitudes have been transformed to the johnson v system according to the method described by alcock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . as a result of the longer time baseline ,",
    "the average number of observation epochs per star is also greater , often in the range 700 to 1000 .",
    "the sampling rate and data distribution is the same as in the case of the rr1 stars .",
    "in particular , there is only a 1  d quasi - periodicity in the sampling but no trace of 1  yr aliasing .",
    "the accuracy of the individual data points is also the same as for the rr1 data , but , because of the larger amplitudes , the overall signal - to - noise ratio ( snr=@xmath2 , @xmath3 is the total ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude , @xmath4 is the standard deviation of the residuals ) is larger ( @xmath5snr@xmath6 , whereas for the rr1 stars @xmath5snr@xmath7 , although this figure refers to the data in the r color , which further lowers the snr ",

    "we performed a standard frequency analysis based on a fourier approach and a ` pre - whitening ' technique ( e.g. , deeming 1975 , with the fast transformation method recommended by kurtz 1985 ) . before executing the fourier transformation ,",
    "outlying points have been omitted by checking the distribution of the magnitudes and leaving out data points separated from a compact set which is thought to represent the lightcurve plus random noise .",
    "the relative number of points omitted in this way varied between 1% and 4% and most often these omitted points were obtained in very poor seeing .",
    "the classification of the variables was performed in three major steps :    * frequency analysis with pre - whitening in the @xmath11 $ ]  d@xmath10 band , visual inspection of the frequency spectra and folded lightcurves , and preliminary selection of variable types . *",
    "reanalysis of the pre - selected multiperiodic variables by three successive pre - whitenings and a closer examination of the frequency spectra .",
    "* visual inspection of the lightcurves of all variables to check the above classifications .    except for the first pre - whitening cycle ,",
    "when the main pulsation component is filtered out from the time series , we used a single - component least squares fit for whitening . because of the high nonlinearity , for the main pulsation component we utilized all harmonics up to the third one .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the classification is based on the observed frequency pattern in a wide frequency band .",
    "therefore , the significance of a given pattern is determined through a comparison of a large number of other features which might make that pattern less significant than if we made the comparison in a smaller frequency band ( the chance of detecting higher , noise - induced peaks increases with the increase of the frequency band ) . for example , if we choose a narrow band around the main pulsation component , and search for equidistant triplet in the spectrum , a considerable fraction of the blazhko ( bl ) stars that were classified after the inspection of the wide frequency band as bl stars with doublet patterns ( hereafter bl1 stars ) will prove to have triplet patterns and will be classified as bl2 stars ( see sect .",
    "although some arguments can be given for the preference of a classification based on pattern search in a narrow frequency band , we follow a more conservative approach , and our classification ( if not stated otherwise ) refer to the results obtained from the above wide frequency band .",
    "variable types and their respective totals obtained in the course of the above analysis are listed in table 1 .",
    "the notation is the same as in a00 , except for the blazhko stars , where we use similar symbols both for variables with apparently single modulation components ( bl1 stars ) and those with two symmetrically - spaced modulation components straddling the main pulsation component ( bl2 stars ) . in a00",
    "we assigned the symbol `` bl '' only to the bl2 stars , in order to maintain a coherent nomenclature with the handful of variables which have been analyzed in the galactic field .",
    "these few variables all display triplets in their frequency spectra .",
    "however the analysis of our larger sample strongly suggests that the two types of modulation overlap and they are indicative of the same underlying phenomenon which we denote by `` bl '' .    as discussed earlier , our statistics have not been corrected for multiple identifications due to field overlap",
    "this results in incidence rates which differ from the true rates by , at most , 0.1% .",
    "one reason that we did not make this correction is that , in critical cases , classification of the same variable star may depend on the particular time series we analyzed .",
    "for example , the same star might appear in one field with many observed epochs and in the other with a much smaller number .",
    "if a modulation component has an amplitude near the noise level , it could potentially be classified as both a blazhko and as a single - mode variable ( an example is with variable star identified as both , macho i d 17.3194.3230 and 10.3194.499 ) .",
    "a similar ambiguity might arise in the classification of bl1 and bl2 stars if the signal - to - noise ratio is low ( e.g. , macho i d 6.6811.969 and 13.6811.4172 ) .",
    "we found five variables which have been classified both as bl1- and bl2-types . among the 400 bl1 stars",
    "there are 13 duplicates with the same bl1 classification .",
    "similarly , we found 8 duplicate identifications among the 331 bl2 stars which were classified identically in both instances .",
    "these duplications suggest that our classification is repeatable and reliable .",
    "the notation in table  1 incorporates the notation of udalski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the radial pulsation mode , in which the symbols fu , fo and so denote the fundamental , first and second overtone modes , respectively .",
    "the rr0@xmath9 m variables are similar to the bl stars in that their amplitude spectra exhibit close secondary components .",
    "however , their frequency patterns are more complicated and show no obvious sign of dominant , equidistant frequency components ( around the main pulsation component ) . for pc variables ,",
    "the structure remaining around the main pulsation component can not be resolved , and the few successive pre - whitenings do not eliminate these features from the amplitude spectrum .",
    "although the failure of the pre - whitening technique indicates a long - term variation in the signal frequency ( or even in the amplitude ) , we must note that it is also possible ( at least in some cases ) that we are witnessing blazhko modulations with very long periods .",
    "this contention is supported by the fact that the present sample contains bl stars with modulation periods of several years . with this",
    "long bl periods , the modulation components are quite close to each other but are still well - resolved due to the long temporal baseline of the observations .",
    "several bl stars additionally display a pc character . in such cases",
    "the variables have been classified as bl - type , despite the additional pc behavior .    a significant fraction ( 5% ) of the stars in this sample display frequency components at integer @xmath12 .",
    "these are labelled rr0@xmath8d variables ( such stars also were found in a00 )",
    ". clearly this behavior indicates some instrumental or reduction artefact . at present",
    "the source of this is unknown .",
    "the difference between the rr0@xmath8mi and nc variables is that in the former class ( most probably ) all variables are rr0 stars , but they exhibit extra peaks in their frequency spectra , which are not easy to explain within any simple framework ( e.g. , multimode pulsation ) . in the case of nc stars , classification is not possible either because of the limited dataset , or because of the ` strange - looking ' light curve ( e.g. , drift - like mean - light variation ) . while additional interesting physical behavior may be present in these stars , we expect ( but have not established ) that extrinsic effects are responsible for many such classifications .",
    "many new lmc cepheid variables have already been discovered , both by the macho and by the ogle projects .",
    "after cross - identification of the apparent cepheid variables found in our initial sample with both databases , we find that 67% of the fo",
    "/ so cepheids reported in this paper are new discoveries .",
    "statistical errors ( standard deviations @xmath4(% ) ) of the incidence rates are calculated from the assumption that the population follows a poisson distribution ( i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of objects in the @xmath15-th population ) .",
    "this yields the following expression for the standard deviation of the population ratio @xmath16 @xmath17 bl stars constitute a significant fraction of the rr0 population in the lmc according to table  1 .",
    "therefore , for the first time , bl stars can be used for reliable statistical studies .",
    "these results will be presented in the next sections .    since the spatial distribution of variables is a separate issue from the ones to be discussed in the following sections , here , in figure  1 , we show the field - by - field distribution of the bl and all rr0 stars .",
    "it is seen that there are considerable differences in the number of rr0 stars among the various fields , but this correlates with the stellar density of the fields ( e.g. , fields 53 , 55 and 57 are far from the lmc bar ) .",
    "the ratio of bl to total number of rr0 stars also shows some fluctuations , especially in the lower - density fields .",
    "therefore , this fluctuation might have a statistical origin .",
    "for example , for a sample size of n=50 , an observed incidence rate of 3% has a 2.4% standard deviation . in the well - populated fields the relative number ratios fluctuate around 10% , suggesting that this ratio might be the same in all fields .",
    "when the full sample is considered , we get an average incidence rate of bl stars of @xmath18% ( the error corresponds to @xmath19 standard deviation of the mean ) .",
    "we recall that the incidence rate of the rr1@xmath8bl stars in the lmc is 3.9% ( see a00 ) .",
    "although the frequency of the rr0@xmath8bl stars have proven to be lower than the commonly cited value of 2030% , they are still three times more common in the lmc than their rr1 counterparts .",
    "it is possible that some rr1-bl stars might have been missed because of their low modulation amplitudes but it seems unlikely that so many bl stars were selectively lost due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "first of all , it is seen that both groups of stars cover the same ranges of parameters in this diagram . based solely on their absolute magnitudes , blazhko variables are indistinguishable from singly - periodic rr0 stars .",
    "indeed , as shown in table  6 , the average of the mean magnitudes of both classes agree within their statistical errors",
    ". both classes of stars display large scatter in @xmath62 .",
    "this is due to various effects , including crowding , inhomogeneous reddening within the lmc , differences in the absolute magnitudes , finite geometrical extension of the lmc and , of course , measurement / calibration errors . despite the large scatter",
    ", some trend in the average magnitudes is observable .",
    "this trend is in qualitative agreement with the well - known relation between period and luminosity observed in other stellar clusters ( e.g. , kovcs & walker 2001 ) , and also expected from stellar evolution theory , which predicts brighter horizontal branches at lower metallicities ( i.e. , at longer periods  see castellani , chieffi & pulone 1991 ) .",
    "-3 mm next we turn to the comparison of the fourier parameters related to the main pulsation component @xmath44 and its harmonics . denoting by @xmath63 the amplitude and by @xmath64 the phase of the fourier component at frequency @xmath65 , and employing the standard",
    ", epoch - independent phase difference @xmath66 , figures  3 and 4 show the variations of these quantities as functions of the period .",
    "it is seen that with increasing order , the fourier amplitudes of the bl stars become significantly lower than those of the rr0-s stars ( at the same period ) . a similar , but much weaker effect",
    "also exists among the phases as can be inferred from the computed average values and from their errors ( see table  6 ) .",
    "this result implies that the modulation - free light curves of the bl stars show less skewness and have lower total amplitudes than their singly - periodic counterparts ( see table  6 ) .",
    "the less significant difference between the phases suggests that the @xmath67[fe / h ] relation derived by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) may have a wider validity  when applied to the average light curve  than was originally suggested by these authors on the basis of the temporal fourier decompositions of a few bl stars .",
    "( lack of similarity between the temporal lightcurves of the bl stars and those of the single - mode rr0 stars has recently been studied by jurcsik , benk & szeidl 2002 . )",
    "it is also worth noting that the definite correlation between the period and the phases implies that the metallicity of the majority of the rr0 stars in the lmc is confined to a relatively narrow interval , as follows from the @xmath68 diagram for the double - mode variables ( popielski , dziembowski & cassisi 2000 ; kovcs 2001 ) , and also from direct spectroscopic measurements ( bragaglia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in this section we will discuss both the frequency with which modulation timescales appear in the bl population and the incidence with which the stronger modulation component is at higher or lower frequency than the primary pulsation peak .",
    "for this purpose , we define the sign of the modulation frequency @xmath45 ( @xmath69 ) to be positive if @xmath70 and negative if the reverse is true ( here @xmath71 and @xmath72 are , respectively , the amplitudes of the modulation components on the higher and lower frequency sides of the main pulsation component ) . with the above definition we can include all bl stars and study if there is a preference for a dominant frequency / amplitude pattern .",
    "figure  5 shows the resulting distribution function .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is a strong preference for frequency patterns where the modulation amplitude on the higher frequency side is larger than its lower frequency counterpart .",
    "we find that 74% of all bl stars have positive @xmath45 .",
    "similar ratios are observed when the two types of bl stars are studied separately : @xmath73 for 79% of the bl1 stars and 68% of the bl2 stars .",
    "blazhko variables with very long modulation periods and those with periods as short as 50 days occur with about the same probability . for shorter",
    "modulation periods the number of bl stars sharply decreases and reaches very small incidence rates for modulation periods shorter than about 25  d. nevertheless , one can still find a few stars with very short blazhko periods : 9.5360.804 and 6.6212.1121 have @xmath74 and @xmath75  d@xmath10 , respectively , with the latter value being the only one in the whole sample exceeding @xmath76  d@xmath10 .",
    "we also note that similarly short modulation period was observed in ah  cam by smith et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "it is also a matter of interest whether the small deviations from a strictly equidistant frequency spacing in the case of the bl2 stars are statistically significant .",
    "we recall that in the course of a similar analysis of the rr1 stars it was shown that the observed deviations are not significant ( see a00 ) .",
    "following the same notation as in a00 , we compute the quantity @xmath77 to characterize the degree of deviation from equidistant spacing . we show the distribution function obtained from the analysis of the bl2 stars in figure  6 .",
    "we select the triplets from the frequency spectra trough the following automated procedure :    * compute successively pre - whitened amplitude spectra in the @xmath78  d@xmath10 neighborhood of the main pulsation component .",
    "five pre - whitening cycles are computed and the highest peak obtained after each cycle is stored . *",
    "the `` strongest secondary component '' @xmath79 is chosen from the stored peak frequencies by requiring @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the total timespan of the respective dataset .",
    "this condition produces a distinction between pc and long - period bl stars . *",
    "a third peak is selected from frequencies appearing on the side opposite to the main component where the `` strongest secondary component '' was found .",
    "the variable is classified as a bl2-type if @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "this condition is used to select triplets with `` approximately '' equidistant frequency spacings .    in nine cases out of the 331 bl2 variables ,",
    "this automatic selection method could not find a triplet , usually because the large pc component coexisting with the triplet did not allow the process to reach the level of the blazhko components within the five pre - whitening cycles .",
    "a high noise level was also a factor in some cases .",
    "therefore , figure  6 shows the results for the remaining 322 stars .",
    "( it is noted that five variables from this sample yielded considerably smaller @xmath45 values than the ones listed in table  4 .",
    "again , this difference is accounted for by the large pc component in these stars . in order to maintain a close compatibility with the subsequent statistical tests , we keep these different modulation frequencies in the investigation of the distribution of the non - equidistant spacings . )    we see that , with few exceptions , all frequency deviations are within @xmath85  d@xmath10 .",
    "this is about one half of the characteristic linewidth ( i.e. , @xmath86  d@xmath10 ) . in order to assess",
    "if this degree of unequal spacing still can be explained as a result of noise - induced frequency - shift , we perform the following test .",
    "artificial time - series are generated with equidistant triplets given by the fourier decompositions ( see sect .",
    "2 ) of the 331 bl2 stars .",
    "then , a gaussian white noise is added to these data with the standard deviation of the fit of the original data . in the next step",
    "these test data are processed in the same way as the real observations .",
    "finally , we use the peak frequencies obtained from the analysis to compute @xmath87 , and plot the corresponding histogram .",
    "the result is shown in figure  7 .",
    "comparison with figure  6 reveals that the two distributions are very similar to each other , although the test data show a smaller dispersion and no outliers above @xmath88  d@xmath10 .",
    "the derived standard deviations are consistent with this conclusion . after applying a @xmath56 criterion for the omission of the outliers ,",
    "we find @xmath89  d@xmath10 and @xmath90  d@xmath10 . by performing the above test for 10 different realizations of the noise for each time - series ,",
    "we get @xmath91  d@xmath10 , where the error represents the standard deviation of the ten @xmath92 values obtained with the various realizations .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the observed and test values is statistically significant .",
    "therefore , the observed small deviations from equidistant spacing can not be accounted for by purely noise - induced frequency - shifts .    in checking the notes",
    "( see table  2 ) related to the nine variables mentioned before for not passing the automatic selection criterion and those 18 stars which did not pass the @xmath56 criterion with respect to the symmetric spacing , we find the following . except for two cases ,",
    "the lightcurves of the variables have some peculiarity  often of a pc nature ",
    "but we also find remarks on high noise level and small second modulation component .",
    "in one case there is no comment and in a single case the observed frequency is declared ` nice ' .",
    "our conclusion from all these tests is that the cause of non - equidistant frequency spacing has various origins , including cases when neither the noise level , nor peculiar additional features are suspected to be responsible for the deviation .",
    "the cause of the non - equidistant spacing should be studied in detail on a star - by - star basis by considering various effects in addition to the noise - induced frequency - shift as discussed above .    in some models a resonance between the fundamental and blazhko periods @xmath93",
    "could be a matter of interest .",
    "therefore , we compute the fractional part of @xmath94 and plot its distribution function . as can be verified from figure  8 , there are no resonances between the two periods and the distribution is essentially flat for all fractional values .",
    "the fluctuations are of statistical origin , because the relative standard deviation in an average bin is 23% ( assuming a poisson distribution ) .",
    "we now investigate the distribution of the modulation amplitudes .",
    "there are two important properties to address : ( a ) range of the relative ( pulsation vs. modulation ) strength of the modulation amplitudes , and ( b ) degree of asymmetry of the left- ( @xmath95 ) and right- ( @xmath96 ) modulation components .",
    "we employ the fourier decompositions both for the bl1 and for the bl2 stars to get the observed values of @xmath23 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "since noise always introduces some non - zero excess power at all frequencies , a distortion of the distributions at low modulation amplitudes is expected .",
    "we plot the distribution of the relative modulation strength in figure  9 . in order to minimize the effect of noise mentioned above",
    ", we take the largest modulation component in each case .",
    "the distribution sharply peaks at @xmath97 and decays with a long tail after @xmath98 .",
    "it is important to observe that there is a wide range of possible modulation strengths from very weak to very strong with the largest having @xmath99 . considering extreme modulation strengths , we call attention to the specific cases of variables 2.5870.4967 with max(@xmath100)@xmath101 and 9.4997.754 , with max(@xmath100)@xmath102 . the modulation components",
    "are clearly detected for both stars .",
    "the asymmetry in the modulation amplitudes is a significant problem for both presently available models ( shibahashi 2000 , nowakowski & dziembowski 2001 ) . to quantitize the degree of asymmetry , we introduce the following parameter    @xmath103    we recall that the amplitudes are computed from fourier fits which include both the @xmath95 and @xmath96 components .",
    "q is found to cover almost all values , partly as a result of noise and partly due to the presence of ` hidden ' bl2 variables among the bl1 stars .",
    "in fact , if we perform an automated search for symmetric frequency patterns in the way mentioned at the beginning of this section , we find that 160 out of the 400 bl1 stars could be classified as bl2-type .",
    "figure  10 displays the distribution function of all bl stars . as we have already seen in figure  5",
    ", there is a strong dominance of variables with @xmath104 .",
    "the distribution is very broad but the most probable cases are those with @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "of course , when the above distribution is plotted only for the bl1 variables , we find a deficit at small @xmath107 values and the distribution is double - peaked at larger / smaller @xmath108 values .",
    "the bl2 variables are mostly confined to the @xmath109 interval , but some extreme asymmetric cases can also be found .",
    "for example , variable 77.7793.1432 shows a large positive asymmetry with @xmath110 .",
    "our standard method of analysis described in sect .  2 did not find any definite signature of two interesting features ( both of these are expected within the frameworks of either the oblique rotator or of the resonant mode coupling models ) .",
    "the first feature we expect is due to the long - term periodic variation of the average brightness .",
    "the presence of this component is expected from non - linear mode - coupling .",
    "the other possible feature is an equidistant quintuplet structure around @xmath44 .",
    "this property is predicted by the oblique rotator model and is also expected when mode - coupling occurs . since such features are not visible in the observed ( individual ) frequency spectra , we employ a method of spectrum averaging in order to amplify such small signals ( if they are present ) .",
    "our procedure is the following .",
    "the huge differences in the lengths of the blazhko periods require us to normalize the spectra in both the amplitude and frequency domains before averaging . therefore ,",
    "after pre - whitening by the ` trivial ' components ( i.e. , @xmath111 , @xmath44 , @xmath112 , etc . ) and taking the fourier transform of the residuals , each spectrum is divided by its variance for more effective noise filtering of the different quality spectra .",
    "( we always use amplitude spectra  both in the computation of the individual and of the average spectra . )",
    "then , all peaks are identified and shifted by the amount necessary to position the modulation components in the same place in each case .",
    "then , this unified frequency band is divided into equidistant bins and the maximum amplitude values of the peaks are found for each bin .",
    "these values are used in the binned - and - normalized version of original frequency spectrum .",
    "finally , all these spectra are added together and the average is plotted for visual inspection . to demonstrate",
    "the effectiveness of the method , figure  11 reveals the result obtained by the analysis of a small sample of bl2 variables .",
    "we see that the signal - to - noise ratio of the average spectrum has dramatically improved compared to the majority of the individual spectra .",
    "the pre - whitening by the @xmath44 component ( and its harmonics ) , results in a dip at @xmath113 . as we shall see in the following subsections , dips related to pre - whitening will show up more obviously when using a large set of variables .",
    "occasionally , a rather large separation is observable between the peaks in the individual normalized spectra ( e.g. , variable 5.4288.4400 ) .",
    "this effect is due to the long modulation periods of those stars , which results in a greater stretch in the frequency domain .",
    "therefore , because of the finite temporal baseline of the observations , we observe fewer peaks in the very narrow frequency band corresponding to the long modulation period .",
    "pc behavior is also observable in some cases ( e.g. , macho i d 5.4285.302 ) .",
    "the variable 5.4891.855 represents one of the handful cases where a quadruple structure is observed , but with unequal frequency spacings .      in order to reach the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio , we employ all bl stars in the computation of an average spectrum . individual frequency spectra",
    "are computed in the @xmath114 $ ]  d@xmath10 band . by using @xmath115 bins in all cases ,",
    "each spectrum is transformed in the frequency domain of @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the test frequency @xmath79 .",
    "the result is somewhat sensitive to the choice of number of bins . if the bins are too wide ( compared to the linewidth ) , then the hidden signal will be less effectively recovered because of the neighboring smaller peaks ( which come from the noise ) will lower the amount of power collected in the bin of interest . on",
    "the other hand , bins which are too narrow will result in a division of signal power into several adjacent bins due to the noise - induced frequency - shift of the peak associated with the signal . with the above choice of bin number we cover approximately the characteristic linewidth at the moderately short blazhko period of @xmath118  days .",
    "this bin width is also appropriate for possible frequency shifts due to noise ( see figures  6 and 7 ) . in order to avoid too large a deformation in the plot due to the large dip at zero frequency ( each time series has zero average ) ,",
    "the final spectrum is shifted downward by an appropriate amount , then stretched in the vertical axis to cover the @xmath119 $ ] interval by the [ min , max ] range of the spectrum .",
    "figure  12 shows the resulting amplitude spectrum .",
    "we observe a definite peak at @xmath120 .",
    "some earlier studies on galactic blazhko variables also indicated the presence of this component ( borkowski 1980 ; kovcs 1995 ; nagy 1998 ) .",
    "however , the data used in those studies suffered from very strong aliasing by the main periods of the variables caused by the observational technique employed when those variables were observed . as a result",
    ", the possibility of power leakage from the @xmath121 components to frequencies differing by @xmath44 from these modulation components is expected .",
    "since the observed amplitude is influenced by the size of bins and noise level , the simplest way to get an estimate on the amplitude and on the significance of the peak is to add a sinusoidal tracer of a given frequency to the signal .",
    "this has been done , and the result shown in figure  13 is obtained . by comparing the two peaks we estimate the overall amplitude of the observed modulation in the average light level of about @xmath122  mag .",
    "a further characteristic feature observable in the spectrum is the slow rise of the signal power from @xmath123 to zero .",
    "this mild trend is most probably due to long - term instrumental or photometric calibration effects .",
    "side peaks at @xmath124 have been searched for in the same manner as the @xmath45 component . here",
    "the number of bins used was @xmath125 because of the larger bandwidth required by this analysis .",
    "the average spectrum of all the bl stars is shown in figure  14 .",
    "in addition to some excess power very close to the prewhitened @xmath44 component and to @xmath121 , we may also suspect a peak at @xmath126 , very close to the noise level .",
    "the excess power near @xmath44 ( and probably also at @xmath121 ) is associated with the observed pc character of some variables . on average , this is a small effect , but in a few individual cases this may be comparable to the blazhko effect ( e.g. 6.6570.771 and 78.5615.905 ) .    in order to estimate an upper limit for possible quadruplet components , we injected tracer signals into the individual time series in the same fashion as in our analysis for the @xmath45 component .",
    "the effect of an @xmath127  mag amplitude tracer is shown in figure  15 .",
    "we see that this type of component would have been easily detectable from the present database . a test with an even lower amplitude of @xmath128",
    "mag shows that this would be also detectable , although with a lower significance .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that if equidistant quadruplet structures exist in the bl stars , they would have amplitudes ( on average ) less than @xmath129  mag .",
    "we have studied the global statistical properties of amplitude- and phase - varying fundamental mode rr  lyrae ( bl ) stars by performing a frequency analysis of 6391 variables from the macho lmc database .",
    "we found 731 bl stars which is by far the largest population known in a single stellar system . because of the large sample and the long time baseline of the macho project observations , it was possible to obtain statistically significant results , describing certain overall properties of the bl phenomenon .",
    "the main results are the following :    * fundamental mode ( rr0 ) bl stars constitute 11.9% of the presently analyzed lmc rr0 population ( 6158 stars ) .",
    "this incidence rate is three times larger than that of their first overtone ( rr1 ) counterparts ( see alcock et al .",
    "a continuous transition seems to exist between variables showing an equidistant triplet around ( and including ) their main pulsation component in their frequency spectra and those displaying only a close doublet ( bl2- and bl1-types , respectively ) .",
    "this suggests that strongly asymmetric modulation amplitudes are not rare among the bl2 stars and their bl1 counterparts represent only extreme cases when the missing component has such a low amplitude that it becomes buried by the observational noise .",
    "* 74% of the bl stars have larger modulation amplitudes on the higher frequency side of the main pulsation component .",
    "* statistical tests indicate that some fraction of the bl2 stars may have non - equidistant frequency spacing .",
    "there is also a small subgroup of 20 variables ( rr0@xmath9 m class ) which display several close peaks at the main pulsation component but without apparent regularity in their frequency spacing .",
    "* there is a nearly uniform distribution of blazhko modulation periods ( @xmath130 ) from @xmath118 to several hundred or even thousand days . in comparison ,",
    "variables with @xmath131  d are rare .",
    "* modulation amplitude ( @xmath96 and @xmath95 ) components around the main pulsation component ( @xmath23 ) in the frequency spectra are usually in the range @xmath132 , but there are also more extreme values .",
    "* there is a variation with the overall amplitude of @xmath0  mag with a period of @xmath130 in the average brightness of the bl stars .",
    "* no clear trace of a quintuplet structure is found around the main pulsation component .",
    "the overall upper limit of the amplitude of such a component is estimated to be less than @xmath129  mag . *",
    "no difference is found in the long - term average brightness between the singly - periodic and bl rr0 stars .",
    "however there are small , but systematic , differences in the fourier decompositions of the modulation - free light curves of the bl stars and those of the singly - periodic stars .",
    "the differences yield average bl light curves which have smaller amplitudes and lower degree of skewness than their singly - periodic counterparts . * the pc variables ( stars with unresolved power at the main pulsation component )",
    "show an incidence rate of 2.9% , which is much lower than the rate of 10.6% of the rr1-pc stars .",
    "most of the above conclusions are very similar to those given by moskalik & poretti ( 2003 ) for the galactic bulge rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the main difference is that they find a much higher incidence rate for rr0-bl stars .",
    "their rate is 23% , which is in the often - quoted range for the blazhko stars ( szeidl 1988 ) , but a factor of two higher than what we obtained for our lmc sample .",
    "since the 215 rr0 stars analyzed by moskalik & poretti ( 2003 ) can be considered as a statistically significant sample , we tend to agree with them that metallicity is the most probable agent for causing the difference in the incidence rates .",
    "very recently soszyski et al . (",
    "2003 ) published a similar analyisis on 7612 rr  lyrae stars in the lmc from the ogle - ii database .",
    "although a detailed comparison of our study with theirs is beyond the scope of the present paper , we note the following .",
    "their incidence rates for the bl stars are 15% and 6% for the rr0 and rr1 stars , respectively .",
    "both of these rates are somewhat larger than ours .",
    "it is unclear at this moment what is the reason of this slight discrepancy .",
    "it may come either from the higher signal - to - noise ratio obtained from the use of differential image analysis , or from the higher density of variables in the lmc bar of the ogle sample , or from the details in the search for the modulation components ( for example , a search in a narrower frequency band around the main pulsation component may lead to higher detection rates  see sect .  2 ) .",
    "further comparative studies are needed to answer these questions .",
    "unfortunately , neither the oblique magnetic rotator ( shibahashi 2000 ) nor the rotating resonant pulsator models ( van hoolst , dziembowski & kawaler 1998 ; dziembowski & cassisi 1999 ; nowakowski & dziembowski 2001 ) are capable of explaining the observed properties of the bl population .",
    "one major problem for these models is the production of strongly asymmetric modulation components .",
    "no hint of this behavior is found in the oblique magnetic rotator model , whereas the resonant one is able to explain only mild asymmetry .",
    "although no current observational effort is known to be attempting to detect magnetic fields in rr  lyrae stars , the last result in this field by chadid ( 2001 ) does not support the presence of strong magnetic field in rr  lyrae itself .",
    "the situation is also complicated concerning the direct detection of nonradial pulsation through surface velocity field ( kolenberg 2002 ) .",
    "we conclude that the underlying reason for blazhko behavior is still not understood .",
    "the large sample reported here will allow investigators to select subsamples with common features for further study and will hopefully lead to a theoretical understanding of this rather obvious observational phenomenon .",
    "precise spectroscopic observations to disentangle the large radial pulsation velocity field and the small nonradial one , together with a definite measurement of an upper limit on the magnetic field , are among the most important observational tasks for the near future .",
