    "photonic crystals ( pc ) have shown to be able to control light in ways that were not possible with conventional optics @xcite .",
    "their remarkable properties stem from the unusual dispersion relation as a result of the periodic modulation of their dielectric properties .",
    "most of the interest on pc is related to propagation problems . here",
    "the existence of photonic band - gaps , i.e. a range of frequencies for which light can not propagate in the medium , allows for a new way of guiding and localize light once defects are introduced in the pc @xcite .",
    "photonic crystals in combination with nonlinear effects have been also considered for all - optical switching devices @xcite .",
    "transverse effects in periodic media have been mainly studied in propagation in planar waveguides with periodic modulation of the refractive index in the transverse direction and arrays of couple waveguides . in the first case",
    "the attention has been focused on the so called spatial gap ( or bragg ) solitons @xcite , which are intense peaks with frequencies inside the ( linear ) band - gap .",
    "this is possible thanks to a shift of the photonic band - gap boundaries due to nonlinear effects : the intense core of a gap soliton can propagate freely in the periodic media , while in its less intense tails , where non - linearity can be neglected , light is reflected back to the center due to bragg reflection , sustaining the localized structure .",
    "bragg solitons are usually studied within the coupled - mode theory where only the slowly varying envelope of two counter - propagating beams are considered .",
    "arrays of waveguides are usually studied within the tight - binding approximation , where the system is described by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the guided - mode amplitude in each site .",
    "the evanescent coupling between adjacent waveguide give rise to the so called discrete diffraction .",
    "if nonlinearity is also present discrete solitons can be formed @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a different case , a photonic crystal inside a nonlinear optical cavity , i.e. a system with driving and dissipation .",
    "nonlinear optical cavities typically undergo spatial instabilities leading to the formation of spatial structures similar to what observed in many different fields across science @xcite .",
    "in particular , spatial structures in nonlinear optical cavities have important potential applications in photonics such as memories , multiplexing , optical processing and imaging @xcite .",
    "control of spatial structures is then an important issue for the implementation of such devices . in this context",
    ", different mechanisms of control have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in particular , neubecker and zimmerman reported on experimental pattern formation in presence of an external modulated forcing and observed lockings between the forcing and natural wavelengths @xcite . more recently",
    "the use of the properties of photonic crystals for the control of optical spatial structures has been considered @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed how the photonic band - gap of a photonic crystal could be used to inhibit a pattern forming instability in a self - focusing kerr cavity .",
    "pattern formation in an optically - injected , photonic - crystal vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser , electrically biased below threshold has been observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xcite , a defect in a photonic crystal has been used to achieve stable emission in broad area lasers .    here",
    "we study the inhibition of pattern formation in a mean field model for a degenerate optical parametric oscillator with a photonic crystal .",
    "we first show that the inhibition mechanism introduced in @xcite occurs independently of the type of nonlinearity here being quadratic .",
    "then we introduce an analytical treatment by means of a couple - mode theory that fully explains the phenomenon .",
    "a linear stability analysis allows us to determine analytically the new thresholds shifted in parameter space by pattern inhibition and the form of the unstable modes .",
    "we show that the band - gap region is divided into two different regions : one in which pattern formation takes place due to an energy concentration at the maxima of the photonic crystal modulation , and a different one where the energy concentrates at the minima .",
    "we determine amplitude equations for the unstable modes and find the stationary solutions above threshold analytically .",
    "we show that this scenario is organized by a co - dimension two bifurcation point where both modes become simultaneously unstable .",
    "we also show that in the band - gap , where the pattern arises with a wavenumber half the one of the pc , there is bistability between two different `` phase locked '' solutions differing by a shift of a pc wavelength in the near field .",
    "this bistability stems from the breaking of the translational symmetry by the pc . in large systems",
    "this leads to the formation of domains of different `` phases '' connected by topological walls ( or antiphase boundaries ) @xcite .",
    "this is a different kind of ( spatial ) bistability where the two different `` phases '' do not differ on the phase of the electric field but on the location of the spatial oscillation in the near field .",
    "a phase - matched double resonant degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( drdopo ) , where both pump and signal fields resonate in the cavity , can be described in the mean field approximation by @xcite : @xmath0 +   i { 1 \\over 2 } \\partial_{xx } b \\nonumber \\\\   \\partial_t a & = & -a - i\\delta_s a + ba^ * + i \\partial_{xx } a , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the pump and signal slowly varying amplitudes , @xmath3 is the ratio between the pump and signal cavity decay rates and @xmath4 is the amplitude of the external pump field ( our control parameter ) .",
