    "in the search for the reality conditions on the energy spectra / eigenvalues of non - hermitian hamiltonians [ 1 - 35 ] , it is nowadays advocated ( with no doubts ) that the orthodoxal mathematical hermiticity requirement to ensure the reality of the spectrum of a hamiltonian is not only fragile but also physically deemed remote , obscure and strongly unnecessary .",
    "a tentative weakening of the hermiticity condition through bender s and boettcher s [ 1 ] @xmath10-symmetric quantum mechanics ( ptqm ) ( with @xmath13 denoting parity and @xmath14  time - reversal , a hamiltonian @xmath15 is @xmath10-symmetric if it satisfies @xmath16 ) has offered an alternative axiom that allows for the possibility of non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "such a ptqm theory , nevertheless , has inspired intensive research on the non - hermitian hamiltonians and led to the so - called pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians ( i.e. , a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath15 satisfies @xmath17 or @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a hermitian invertible linear operator and @xmath20 denotes the adjoint ) by mostafazadeh [ 16 - 21 ] which form a broader class of non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra and encloses within those @xmath12-symmetric ones .",
    "moreover , not restricting @xmath21 to be hermitian ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , bagchi and quesne [ 33 ] ) , and linear and/or invertible ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , solombrino [ 28 ] , fityo [ 29 ] , and mustafa and mazharimousavi [ 30 - 32 ] ) would weaken pseudo - hermiticity and lead to real spectra .",
    "based on the inspiring example , nevertheless , by bender , brody and jones [ 35 ] that @xmath22 is a non-@xmath12-symmetric whereas a simple amendment @xmath23 ( that leaves the hamiltonian invariant and allows parity to perform reflection about @xmath24 rather than @xmath25 ) would consequently classify @xmath15 as @xmath12-symmetric ( i.e. , reflection need not necessarily be through the origin ) and promoting znojil s understanding [ 34 ] of bender s and boettcher s ptqm ( i.e. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 need not necessarily mean just the parity and time reversal , respectively ) , we may introduce [ 36 ] a time - reversal - like,@xmath26and a parity - like@xmath27operators that might very well be accommodated by bender s and boettcher s ptqm .    in this case , @xmath28 acting on a function @xmath29 would read @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is said to be @xmath32-symmetric if it satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "hence , our new operators leave the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath8 unaffected and are designed to operate only on the azimuthal descendent eigenvalue equation ( e.g. , equation ( 21 ) below ) of the spherically - separable non - hermitian hamiltonians ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that our parity - like operator @xmath28 in ( 2 ) is hermitian , unitary , and performs reflection through a 2d - mirror represented by the @xmath35-plane . yet",
    ", the proof of the reality of the eigenvalues of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian is straightforward .",
    "let the eigenvalue equation of our @xmath36-symmetric hamiltonian be @xmath37 , then @xmath38 .",
    "using @xmath39 = 0 $ ] we obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 is therefore pure real ( in analogy with bender , brody and jones in [ 35 ] and fits into ptqm - recipe ) .    in the forthcoming proposal , using spherical coordinates , we depart from the traditional radial potential setting ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) into a more general potential of the the form@xmath43 .\\]]we shall use such potential setting in the context of schrdinger hamiltonian@xmath44and within an equally - mixed vector , @xmath45 , and scalar , @xmath46 , potentials setting in the dirac hamiltonian@xmath47 + v\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right ) , \\]]with the possibility of non - hermitian interactions settings in the process . however , it should be noted that such interactions in ( 3 ) with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 represent just variants of the well known hartmann potential [ 38 - 47 ] used in the studies of ring - shaped organic molecules .    for the sake of making our current proposal self - contained ,",
    "we revisit , in section 2 , dirac equation in spherical coordinates and give preliminary foundation on its separability .",
    "we connect , in the same section , dirac descendant hamiltonians with those of schrdinger and provide a clear map for that . in section 3 , we explore some consequences of a class of complexified but @xmath0-symmetrized azimuthal hamiltonians . for a complexified azimuthal interaction @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 )",
    "we use three illustrative examples for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . in section 4 , a recipe of generating functions is provided to keep the magnetic quantum number as is , whenever deemed necessary of course . in the process of preserving the magnetic quantum number @xmath9 , a set of isospectral @xmath56-dependent potentials , @xmath57 , for each set of @xmath58 and @xmath59 is obtained .",
    "this would , moreover , allow reproduction of the conventional - hermitian relativistic and non - relativistic quantum mechanical eigenvalues within our @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian settings . we give our concluding remarks in section 5 .",

    "moreover , one can safely name three `` new '' descendant hamiltonians and recast the corresponding eigenvalue equations ( with @xmath87 for schrdinger and @xmath88 for dirac ) as@xmath89    of course it is a straightforward to work out the explicit forms of @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath5 from ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , and ( 21 ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , if we substitute @xmath90 in ( 19 ) then @xmath91 .",
    "yet , whilst @xmath92 and @xmath93 should be finite , @xmath94 should satisfy the single - valuedness condition @xmath95 . at this point",
    ", we argue that the reality of the spectrum of dirac eigenvalue equation ( 6 ) is ensured not only by requiring @xmath96 but also by requiring @xmath97 . with this understanding",
    ", we may now seek some @xmath10-symmetrization recipe ( be it lvai s [ 37 ] regular @xmath10-symmetrization or @xmath98-symmetrization of mazharimousavi [ 36 ] ) for each ( at a time ) of the descendant hamiltonians in ( 26 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue equation in ( 21 ) with @xmath100 as a coupling parameter in a complexified - azimuthal effective interaction of the form@xmath101would read@xmath102@xmath103 \\phi \\left ( \\varphi \\right ) = 0.\\]]hence , a change of variable of the form @xmath104 would result in    @xmath105    obviously , equation ( 29 ) is the modified bessel equation with imaginary argument and has two independent solutions",
    ". the linear combination of which reads the general solution@xmath106each of these independent solutions should identically satisfy the single - valuedness condition @xmath107 .",
    "one may , nevertheless , use the identities of [ 48 ] and closely follow mazharimousavi s treatment ( namely , equations ( 17 ) - ( 28 ) in [ 36 ] ) and show that@xmath108@xmath109therefore , the regular solution collapses into@xmath110    under such settings , it is obvious that the hamiltonian represented in ( 28 ) reads@xmath111and qualifies to be a @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "that is , @xmath112on the other hand , the eigenvalue equation ( 21 ) with @xmath5 would admit  a regular azimuthal solution represented by the modified bessel function@xmath113and satisfies the single - valuedness condition @xmath114 with @xmath115 as the normalization constant to be found through the relation@xmath116hereby , we have used the fact that our @xmath117 in ( 34 ) is @xmath0-symmetric satisfying @xmath118 .",
    "this would , in effect , suggest that since @xmath119 and @xmath7 of ( 20 ) is therefore hermitian , then @xmath7 of ( 20 ) admits real eigenvalues represented by @xmath120 .",
    "some illustrative consequences ( with @xmath7 of ( 20 ) kept hermitian ) are in order .",
    "should @xmath53 , one may clearly observe that equation ( 20 ) is the very well known associated legendre equation in which @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath124 are the associated legendre functions .",
    "hence , following the regular textbook procedure one may , in a straightforward manner , show that @xmath125 ( i.e. , @xmath126 , is the regular magnetic quantum number ) .",
    "consequently , as long as the hermitian radial equation ( 19 ) is solvable ( could be exactly- , quasi - exactly- , conditionally - exactly - solvable , etc ) for the radial interaction @xmath127 , the spectrum remains invariant and real .",
    "however , the global wavefunction@xmath128(with @xmath129 as the radial quantum number ) would indulge some new probabilistic interpretations .",
    "this is due to the replacement of the regular spherical harmonics @xmath130 part ( for the radially symmetric 3d - hamitonians ) by the new @xmath131-symmetric part @xmath132 ( defined above for our @xmath11-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian model ) .    to see the effect of such a @xmath0-symmetrization on the probability density",
    ", we consider a radial coulombic effective interaction @xmath133 accompanied by an azimuthal effective interaction @xmath134(an illustrative example of fundamental nature ) . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we plot the corresponding probability densities at different values of the coupling parameter @xmath135 for the principle quantum numbers @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "it is clearly observed that whilst the probability density for small @xmath135 imitates the hermitian @xmath56-independent probability density trends , it shifts and intensifies about @xmath139 as @xmath135 increases ( indicating that the corresponding state is more localized , therefore ) . in this case , of course , the rotational symmetry of a purely `` just - radially - symmetric '' coulombic interaction breaks down as a result of @xmath140      taking @xmath143 in ( 23 ) would imply@xmath144 \\theta \\left ( \\theta \\right ) = 0,\\]]where @xmath145 for dirac and @xmath146 for schrdinger settings .",
    "similar equation was reported by dutra and hott [ 47 ] .",
    "the regular solution of which can ( taking @xmath147 and @xmath148 in equation ( 12 ) of ref . [ 47 ] to match with our settings ) very well be copied and pasted to read ( for dirac equation)@xmath149where@xmath150@xmath151 is a `` new '' quantum number , and@xmath152 .\\ ] ]    on the other hand , @xmath153 would ( taking @xmath154 and @xmath148 in equation ( 13 ) of ref.[12 ) for dirac equation ) result in @xmath155@xmath156and@xmath157\\]]for schrdinger case , nevertheless , one may just replace the term @xmath158 by @xmath159 in the above expressions and get the corresponding eigenvalue results . then the general solution for both cases would read@xmath160where @xmath161 is the normalization constant that can be obtained in a straightforward textbook procedure .",
    "hereby , we witness that the general solution ( 44 ) exhibits the change not only in the azimuthal part but also in the angular @xmath8-part .",
    "to keep the magnetic quantum number as is ( i.e. , @xmath162 ) , one may consider the azimuthal part of the general solution to be of the form@xmath163where @xmath164 satisfies the single - valuedness condition @xmath165 .    under such setting , the corresponding eigenvalue equation in ( 21 ) ( with primes denoting derivatives with respect to @xmath56 ) reads@xmath166 in this case @xmath164 would serve as a generating function for the sought after azimuthal potential @xmath167 and shapes the form of the azimuthal solution @xmath168 . as an illustrative example , a generating function @xmath169 would imply@xmath170\\]]which is indeed a non - hermitian and @xmath171-symmetric , @xmath172 .",
    "however , one may wish to follow the other way around and consider a @xmath4-symmetric @xmath173 and solve ( 46 ) for @xmath164 . in this manner",
    ", @xmath167 would now serve as a generating function for @xmath164 and consequently a generating function for @xmath117 .",
    "an immediate example is in order .",
    "consider@xmath174and solve ( 44 ) for a regular @xmath164 to obtain@xmath175then , ( 45 ) would read@xmath176it is , therefore , obvious that all effective potentials @xmath173 satisfying ( 48 ) would essentially change the azimuthal part of the general solution .",
    "moreover , in the process of preserving the magnetic quantum number @xmath9 as defined in the regular hermitian settings , a set of isospectral @xmath56-dependent potentials , @xmath167 , is obtained .",
    "that is , for each set of @xmath177 , all @xmath56-dependent potentials , @xmath167 , satisfying ( 46 ) are isospectral .",
    "in the build up of a generalized quantum recipe ( bender s and boettcher s ptqm in this case ) , a question of delicate nature arises in the process as to `` would ptqm be able to recover some results ( if not all , to be classified as a promising theory ) of the conventional hermitian quantum mechanics ? '' . to the best of our knowledge , only rarely and mainly within regular hermitian ( but @xmath12-symmetric )",
    "settings examples were provided such as the one by bender , brody and jones [ 35 ] mentioned in our introduction section above ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the reality of the energy eigenvalues and other quantum mechanical properties ( rather than the `` recoverability of hermitian quantum mechanical '' results ) were the main constituents and focal points in the studies of the non - hermitian @xmath12-symmetric hamiltonians . in our current proposal , with a new class of non - hermitian @xmath4-symmetric hamiltonians ( having real spectra identical to their hermitian partner hamiltonians ) , we tried to fill this gap , at least partially .    through our over simplified non - hermitian @xmath171-symmetrized hamiltonian ( 33 )",
