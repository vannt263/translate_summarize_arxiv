    "cooling a mechanical resonator to its ground state plays a fundamentally important role in ultrahigh sensitive detection , observation of the transition between the quantum and classical system , and so on .",

    "has been experimentally implemented @xcite . when combing the sideband cooling technique and cryogenic cooling ,",
    "the mechanical resonator can be cooled beyond the nanoscale , and the position of the resonator has been measured @xcite . recently ,",
    "a quantum coherent exchange between the mechanical object and micro / optical wave is achieved @xcite , and the phonon occupation of the resonator is cooled to around one .    for an experimental realization of the optomechanical scheme ,",
    "it is not enough to consider the optomechanical coupling by the radiation pressure only  @xcite .",
    "the motion of the resonator affects the cavity damping significantly , hence it is worth of studying a system of which mechanical motion modulates both the intracavity photon number ( dispersive coupling ) and the cavity damping strength ( dissipative coupling ) @xcite . in recent experiments ,",
    "a microwave optomechanical system is applied to cool a mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "such a system has advantages that it is operated well into the resolved - sideband limit and is compatible with precooling . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , besides the dispersive coupling , there also exists dissipative coupling for such a system .",
    "the experiment with a microdisk - waveguide optomechanical system has demonstrated that , the force from the dissipative coupling dominates the total force applied to the waveguide @xcite . due to these two different couplings , the quantum destructive interference emerges .",
    "the optimal detuning of the incident optical field frequency in stationary state cooling is dependent on the ratio of these two coupling strengths .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the cooling of the resonator does not require the good - cavity limit .",
    "experimental proposals for the two different couplings have been put forward @xcite .    however ,",
    "all of these works above focus on the steady - state cooling . here",
    ", we discuss the cooling of such a dispersively and dissipatively coupled system in _",
    "finite time_. we show that , by modulating the incident pulses , the phonon occupation of the resonator can be lowered to one .",
    "we study the cooling behavior of the mechanical resonator for the system consisting of the dispersive and dissipative coupling in finite time .",
    "when a chirped pulse is applied , better performance in cooling of the mechanical resonator appears with the increase of the cavity damping strength .",
    "this is different from the case there is only dispersive coupling , where a better cooling appears with a smaller cavity damping strength , as shown by liao and law  @xcite .",
    "considering the tunability of the optomechanical dispersive and dissipative coupling strengths  @xcite , we show the different cooling performances of the resonator with a chirped pulse .",
