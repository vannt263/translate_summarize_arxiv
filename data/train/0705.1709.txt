    "our first observation is that this ring is isomorphic to the ring @xmath10 of differential operators on the @xmath3-dimensional projective space twisted by the line bundle @xmath11 . to describe the isomorphism we realise both rings as subrings of the ring @xmath12\\ ] ] of differential operators in @xmath3 variables with polynomial coefficients .",
    "namely any section @xmath13 with divisor @xmath14 can be used to trivialize the bundle over the complement @xmath15 of @xmath16 and thus we have an injective restriction map @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 is of codimension at least @xmath19 in @xmath20 ( recall that @xmath21 ) , we have an isomorphism @xmath22 .",
    "thus we get a ring monomorphism @xmath23 similarly , the bundle @xmath24 is associated with , say , a multiple of the hyperplane in @xmath25 defined by the vanishing of some homogeneous coordinate , whose complement is @xmath20 .",

    "thus the results of borho and brylinski @xcite*theorem 3.8 and remark 3.9 apply : there is a surjective algebra homomorphism @xmath33 given by the infinitesimal action of the group @xmath34 and the kernel is the annihilator @xmath35 of a generalized verma module .",

    "the proof of this theorem uses musson s description @xcite of the algebra of differential operators on a toric variety and partial fourier transforms on weyl algebras as in the work of musson and rueda @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain several families of toric varieties with line bundles whose twisted algebras of differential operators are isomorphic . even in the simplest case of projective spaces , that we treat in detail in section [ s-3 ] ,",
    "the situation is rather rich .",
    "additionally to the projective @xmath3-space and the blow - up at the origin of the affine @xmath3-space there are many other varieties related by such reflection .",
    "they include resolutions of singularities of the varieties considered by levasseur , smith and stafford @xcite in the case of @xmath0 and musson @xcite .",
    "our results extends and unify their results .",

    "notice that the transition functions of @xmath391 depend only on the homogeneous coordinates @xmath138 , for @xmath393 , and when @xmath418 , @xmath419 , they correspond to the transition functions of the serre bundle @xmath420 .",

    ", since the cohomology of projective spaces @xmath417 is concentrated in degree @xmath4 and @xmath423 , it follows also that the cohomology of @xmath115 with values in @xmath391 is concentrated in degree @xmath4 and @xmath423 .",
    "we can also describe explicitly the isomorphism of theorem  [ thm - coh ] using homogeneous coordinates @xmath138 on @xmath115 , knowing the description of the cohomology of projective spaces .",
    "namely , if @xmath424 , the @xmath4-th cohomology of @xmath417 with values in @xmath425 is generated by monomials @xmath426 , @xmath427 and @xmath428 , while , if @xmath429 , the @xmath423-th cohomology with values in @xmath425 is generated ( modulo coboundaries ) by monomials of the same kind , with @xmath430 and @xmath428 ( in all other cases , the cohomologies are trivial ) .    then , the isomorphism of theorem  [ thm - coh ] can be written as @xmath431 for any @xmath414 .",
    "in particular , a basis of the cohomology of @xmath115 with values in @xmath432 is given @xmath433 ( in degree @xmath4 ) by monomials @xmath337 , with @xmath434 and @xmath435 , @xmath436 , ( see also subsection 4.2 . ) and @xmath437 ( in degree @xmath423 ) by monomials @xmath337 , with @xmath434 and @xmath438 , for @xmath393 , and @xmath435 , for @xmath419 .",

    "the @xmath0-module structure on the @xmath4-th cohomology was discussed in subsection 4.2 .",
    ": we now consider the cohomology of degree @xmath423 .",
    "we set now @xmath330 for an integer @xmath440 ; then , by theorem  [ thm - coh ] and the discussion thereafter , we need only discuss the case @xmath441 .      we first compute the possible primitive vectors in @xmath444 ; for this purpose , recall the expressions for the chevalley generators @xmath349 in lemma  [ l - tomatlan ] .",
    "a monomial @xmath337 representing a non - trivial class in @xmath444 is annihilated by @xmath349 , @xmath299 , if and only if @xmath445 , for @xmath419 , by direct computations , using the generators @xmath349 , @xmath446 .",
    "thus , @xmath337 has the form @xmath447 , with @xmath438 , and @xmath448 . using the remaining generators @xmath349",
    ", we see that @xmath449 vanishes in cohomology if and only if @xmath450 , @xmath451 ; then , the remaining exponent is automatically @xmath452 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath442 , the only primitive vector in @xmath444 is the monomial @xmath453 .",

    "therefore , @xmath444 has a unique primitive vector of weight @xmath361 .",
    "moreover , the module @xmath444 is generated by the primitive monomial @xmath453 .",
    "namely , a general differential operator on @xmath457 is of the form @xmath145 , with @xmath332 , @xmath313 positive multiindices , such that @xmath458 satisfies @xmath459 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath337 is a generator of @xmath444 if @xmath438 , @xmath393 , @xmath435 , @xmath419 , and @xmath460 .",
    "for such a weight @xmath461 , the differential operator @xmath462 belongs , by a direct computation , to @xmath457 , and it is easy to verify that @xmath463 all these computations show , by the very definition of verma modules , that there is a surjective , non - trivial module homomorphism @xmath464 , whose image is irreducible ( since there is only one primitive vector up to multiplication by @xmath465 ) : this yields the above isomorphism .",
    "[ rem - chev ] theorem  [ thm - irr ] refers only to @xmath467 or @xmath387 , with @xmath468 : the reason is that @xmath433 the resolution of singularities @xmath469 , corresponding to @xmath248 , are related to @xmath470 by an isomorphism of the corresponding fans , which lifts to the chevalley involution of @xmath0 on the corresponding ( twisted ) rings of differential operators , and @xmath437 , if @xmath244 , @xmath387 , and the two blow - ups @xmath244 and @xmath245 are related to each other by an automorphism of the corresponding fan , which also lifts to the chevalley involution at the level of differential operators .",
    "hence , by means of the chevalley involution , we can deduce the @xmath0-module structure of the twisted cohomologies of @xmath469 , @xmath248 , and of @xmath91 , for @xmath244 , from theorem  [ thm - coh ] and  [ thm - irr ] ."
