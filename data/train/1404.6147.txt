    "bipolar outflows are an ubiquitous phenomena associated with star formation . the leading theories on the origin of protostellar outflows indicate that they are generated through the interaction of ionized disk material and the magnetic fields from the forming star and/or disk ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "protostellar winds entrain the host cloud s molecular gas thereby producing molecular outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is substantial observational evidence showing that molecular outflows from low - mass young stars tend to have relatively well - collimated lobes early in their development and then evolve to have wider opening angle flows at later stages @xcite .",

    "it has been proposed that jet axis wandering ( precession ) could produce wider cavities as the protostar evolves @xcite . however , in most sources the opening angle of the precession cone is smaller than the observed wide - angle outflow cavity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a second possibility is that protostellar winds have both a collimated and a wide - angle component , and the observed molecular outflow is predominantly driven by one of the two components , depending on the age of the protostar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this scenario",
    "the opening angle and axis direction of the wind arising from the protostar / disk system remain approximately constant , but the wind increasingly disperses more of the circumstellar gas , thereby creating wider outflow cavities , as the protostar evolves and the circumstellar envelope decreases in density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one possible explanation to this offset is that the knots and the molecular bullets are produced by the same mass ejection episode , and that the difference in position is caused by the fact that the two different datasets were taken approximately a decade apart . a tangential velocity of approximately 570 km s@xmath1 would cause the observed positional offset between the optical knot and the molecular bullet .",

    "there is also evidence , from the optical and infrared observations by @xcite and our sma data ( _ i.e. _ , the high - velocity bullets shown in figure 1_b _ ) , that b5-irs 1 powers a very collimated ( jet - like ) wind",
    ". the molecular outflow jet component is also observed in our pvd as a structure at high outflow velocities distinct from the central rotated  _ x _ \" structure in figure 4 .",

    "these pvds present different structures compared to those shown in figure 4 . at low outflow velocities ( @xmath67  km s@xmath1 ) there are",
    "two bright curved structures that have similar velocity ranges in both outflow lobes , and are related to the low - velocity and very wide - angle structures seen in figure 1_b_. in addition , there are two ( faint ) ring - like structures in both sides of the flow at intermediate velocities ( at outflow velocities of about 10 to 45  km s@xmath1 )",
    ". such structures , in position - velocity space , are reminiscent of radially expanding shells or bubbles ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are also similar to the elliptical structures expected in the pvd of a jet with a low inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ( see figure 26 of * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed above , the integrated intensity map at intermediate velocities show narrow parabolic structures , very different from the circular ( or semi - circular ) structures associated with radially expanding bubbles . furthermore , the observed structure is somewhat similar to the structures seen in in young ( class 0 ) jet - powered molecular outflows like l1448 @xcite , l1157 @xcite and hh 211 @xcite . in these young sources",
    "the molecular outflow cavities have a moderate opening angle ( similar to the intermediate - velocity structures we detect in b5-irs1 ) that are presumably formed by the passage of jet bow - shocks , consistent with the bow shock - driven molecular outflow model of @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems more likely that the observed intermediate - velocity features are caused by propagating bow shocks in a jet , or highly collimated wind .",
    "the high - velocity bullets are located at the tips of the intermediate - velocity elliptical structure in the position - velocity diagrams shown in figure 5 ( and at the far ends of the pvd shown in figure 4 ) .",
    "hence , it seems possible that these high - velocity features are tracing the tip ( or head ) of the bow - shock responsible for the intermediate - velocity cavities .",
    "one of the most striking characteristics of the b5-irs1 outflow is the different structures observed at different ranges of velocities . as discussed above , the high - velocity bullets and intermediate velocity structure are driven by a collimated ( jet - like ) wind , while the low - velocity lobes are consistent with being formed by a wide - angle wind .",
    "an increasing number of outflows have been observed that show two components ( a wide - angle structure and a collimated feature ) .",
    "they include l1551 @xcite , hh 46/47 @xcite , cepheus hw2 @xcite , and source i @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , none of these outflows show a spider - like structure like the one we observe in b5-irs 1 .",
    "these `` dual component '' molecular outflows are generally explained by assuming that the underlying protostellar wind that entrains the surrounding ambient gas has a wide - angle morphology with a narrow component ( with a much higher outflow momentum rate ) along the wind axis as in the x - wind models of @xcite and disc - magnetosphere boundary outflow launching models of @xcite .",
    "the spider - like morphology of the b5-irs 1 molecular outflow may be explained with these kinds of models .",
    "one hypothesis for the observed evolutionary trend in outflow opening angle is that the observed molecular outflow ( produced by the interaction between the protostellar wind and the surrounding ambient gas ) is mostly driven by one of the two different components , depending on the evolutionary stage of the protostar and the density distribution of the circumstellar material . during the early deeply embedded stage of protostellar evolution ( class 0 )",
    "only the high - momentum component along the outflow axis is able to puncture through the dense circumstellar envelope , producing a collimated ( jet - like ) outflow . at later stages ( _",
    "i.e. _ , class i and ii ) , after the envelope looses mass through outflow entrainment and infall onto the protostar , the wider component will be able to entrain the remaining circumstellar material at larger angles away from the outflow axis .",
    "if such picture is correct , we should then expect a transitional phase when there is little or no molecular gas along the outflow axis , yet enough molecular gas at intermediate angles ( _ i.e. _ , between the outflow axis and the edge of the wide - angle wind ) that would result in a molecular outflow with a component that is approximately midway between the collimated and wide - angle components , and a faint ( or no ) on - axis component .",
    "we suggest this scenario explains the spider - like structure seen in b5-irs1 , which in fact may be considered a young class i source ( based on its spectral energy distribution , e.g. , arce & sargent 2006 ) and hence likely to be in an evolutionary phase close to the transition between class 0 and class i ( see also yu et al .",
    "we argue that in b5-irs1 the molecular outflow material is detected along ( and within 30@xmath8  of ) the outflow axis ( as shown by the high - velocity bullet and the intermediate - velocity structure ) because there is still enough molecular material in the cavity for it to be entrained by the collimated ( jet ) component of the wind ( as expected in a young source ) .",
    "however , as seen in figure 1 ( where the integrated intensity of the outflowing co emission is dominated by the very wide angle structure ) most of the entrainment is taking place at larger angles from the axis where the wide - angle wind is currently interacting with the denser parts of the surrounding envelope .",
    "we observed in the millimeter regime the dust and molecular gas surrounding the young stellar object b5-irs 1 using the submillimeter array .",
    "our conclusions are as follow :    * the millimeter dust continuum emission reported here is tracing the envelope and circumstellar disk surrounding b5-irs 1 . *",
    "our @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) observations resolve the bipolar northeast - southwest outflow associated with b5-irs 1 and find that its morphology is reminiscent of a  spider \" , where three velocity components with different morphologies are present in each lobe . * in addition to detecting the previously observed wide - angle cone - like lobes , our observations for the first time reveal the presence of intermediate - velocity , parabolic shells emerging very close to the young stellar object as well as high - velocity compact molecular bullets which we argue are associated with the optical / ir jet in this source .",
    "these high - velocity features reach outflow ( radial ) velocities of about 50 km s@xmath1 . *",
    "we interpret the peculiar spider - like morphology as a result of the molecular material being entrained by a wind in which the momentum has an angular dependence ( i.e. , larger towards the outflow axis ) .",
    "we believe the peculiar outflow morphology is evident in this source because it is in a transitional evolutionary phase , at a stage that is slightly older than the phase in which the outflow is completely dominated by the on - axis ( collimated ) part of the wind , but slightly younger than the stage in which the outflow entrainment is fully dominated by the wide - angle component of the wind .",
    "* we report the detection @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) emission , which arises from the outflow and the vicinity of b5-irs1 .",
    "we conclude that the protostar b5-irs 1 is a great laboratory to study the process of outflow formation and evolution .",
    "further observations at different wavelengths and at higher angular and velocity resolution are needed to better understand its kinematics as well its launching and entrainment mechanisms .",

    "<S> we present line and continuum observations made with the submillimeter array ( sma ) of the young stellar object barnard 5 - irs1 located in the perseus molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) line observations resolve the high - velocity bipolar northeast - southwest outflow associated with this source . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the outflowing gas shows different structures at three different velocity regimes , in both lobes , resulting in a spider - like morphology . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the low - velocity , cone - like ( wide - angle ) lobes that have previously been observed , we report the presence of intermediate - velocity parabolic shells emerging very close to the class i protostar , as well as high velocity molecular bullets that appear to be associated to the optical / ir jet emanating from this source . </S>",
    "<S> these compact high - velocity features reach radial velocities of about 50 km s@xmath1 away from the cloud velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the peculiar spider - like morphology is a result of the molecular material being entrained by a wind with both a collimated jet - like component and a wide - angle component . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the outflow is in a transitional evolutionary phase between a mostly jet - driven flow and an outflow in which the entrainment is dominated by the wide - angle wind component . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect 1300 @xmath2 continuum emission at the position of the protostar , which likely arises from the dusty envelope and disk surrounding the protostar . finally , we report the detection of @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) emission arising from the outflow and the location of the young stellar object .    </S>",
