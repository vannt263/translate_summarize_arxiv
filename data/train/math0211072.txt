    "first , using geometric methods , we consider the case of @xmath6 .",
    "we establish a topological correspondence between the cayley compactification and the polytope polar to @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the generating set in question ; a simple consequence of this is that the cayley compactification is in fact compact .",
    "we give an essentially complete description of the behavior of the points that are added at infinity to compactify @xmath6 .    moving to the case of an arbitrary group ,",
    "we utilize algebraic methods , specifically that of standard pair decomposition , to give a general description of the cayley compactification of an arbitrary group and generating set , provided that the cost vector giving the weights of the generators is generic .",
    "we begin by giving the definitions of the objects in question , along with a few relatively straightforward lemmas . in section  [ examples ]",
    "we compute a number of examples which illustrate the behavior of cayley compactifications .",
    "section  [ boundary ] and section  [ grobner ] deal with the geometric and algebraic approaches respectively .",
    "given a group @xmath0 ( all groups in this paper will be abelian ) and a finite set of generators @xmath7 , we can define the * cayley graph * @xmath8 to have vertex set equal to the elements of @xmath0 , with two vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 being connected by an edge if @xmath11 . the generators may be given with weights , in which case the length of this edge is defined to be the weight of the generator @xmath12 .",
    "this construction induces a metric space structure on @xmath0 , using the obvious distance function @xmath13 of distance between the corresponding vertices in the cayley graph .",
    "we can then define a class of functions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are vertices of the graph , via @xmath17 .",
    "we will be dealing only with cayley graphs , but this definition makes sense for any graph @xmath0 . for a graph @xmath0 , define @xmath18 to be the @xmath19-subalgebra of all functions @xmath20 generated by constant functions and the functions @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath21 then encodes the metric space structure of the graph .",
    "we state a pair of trivial lemmas concerning the @xmath14 .",
    "[ trivial ] @xmath22 ; @xmath23 .",
    "[ genonly ]    if we have a cayley graph @xmath8 , then the @xmath14 are generated by elements of the form @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath26 is any set of generators for @xmath0 , the @xmath14 are contained in the @xmath19-module generated by elements of the form @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "we now define the central concept which allows us to construct the cayley compactification , that of a geodesic .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a graph , and we have a map @xmath29 , @xmath30 , such that for all @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "then we say that @xmath34 is a * geodesic * in @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath35 is an unbounded subset of @xmath36 , we call @xmath37 an * infinite geodesic * ; if @xmath38 , we call @xmath37 a * full geodesic*. @xmath37 is a full geodesic if and only if @xmath37 consists of the vertices of an infinite path with the following condition : for each @xmath39 in the path , the subsegment of the path from @xmath9 to @xmath10 provides a shortest path in @xmath0 between the two vertices .",
    "we then have the following definition and lemma , which explains why geodesics are useful at all .    for any infinite geodesic @xmath40",
    ", we define the operator @xmath41 via @xmath42 .",
    "it is not a priori clear why this limit exists , but it does so in the case we are concerned with , as we show in the following lemma .    for @xmath43 , and for @xmath40 any infinite geodesic , @xmath44 exists .",
    "it suffices to show it for the generators of @xmath21 , since @xmath41 is obviously an ring homomorphism ; it s trivial for the constant functions . by lemma  [ genonly ]",
    ", it suffices to show it for functions of the form @xmath45 .",
    "now , because of the triangle inequality , we know that @xmath46 . we claim that the function @xmath47 is nonincreasing as @xmath48 increases , which will finish the proof since its value is an integer in a bounded range , and hence must converge if it is nonincreasing . for any @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 .",
    "but by the geodesic property , we know that @xmath51 ; by the triangle inequality , we also have @xmath52 . plugging this back in",
    ", we get @xmath53 as desired , which completes the proof .",
    "so , for each @xmath37 , we have a valuation ( which is an algebra homomorphism ) @xmath54 . in addition , for each @xmath55 , we have the natural valuation @xmath56 given by @xmath57 .",
    "this brings us to our main definition .",
    "let @xmath8 be a cayley graph .",
    "then the * cayley compactification * @xmath58 consists of the set of valuations @xmath59 , where @xmath37 ranges over all infinite geodesics and @xmath60 ranges over all elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the topology is the @xmath61 topology , where a sequence of valuations @xmath62 converges to @xmath10 if for any function @xmath43 , @xmath63 converges to @xmath64 .",
    "note that if @xmath65 is a geodesic , then by definition @xmath66 converge to @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , this definition makes sense for any graph , not just cayley graphs .",
    "however , cayley graphs , especially those of integer lattices @xmath6 , provide an extremely tractable subclass of infinite graphs with which to work .    justifying the name ,",
    "cayley compactifications are indeed actually compact .    for any group @xmath0 and generating set @xmath1",
    ", the cayley compactification @xmath58 is compact .",
    "we will give two proofs of this theorem via the two main techniques presented in this paper .",
    "in section  [ boundary ] we wil prove it for the case of @xmath6 with unweighted generators using geometric methods ; in section  [ grobner ] we will give an algebraic proof which works in the case of a general group @xmath0 with arbitrarily weighted generators .",
    "finding geodesics of cayley graphs is usually quite easy .",
    "the tricky part is determining what the equivalences are ; this amounts to determining when two geodesics induce the same valuation @xmath41 , as the following two lemmas dispatch the other cases .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath67 are two distinct elements of @xmath0 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are distinct valuations , and thus @xmath60 and @xmath67 correspond to different points in the cayley compactification .    plugging into the definition ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath70 .",
    "suppose @xmath60 is an element of @xmath0 , and @xmath37 is a geodesic .",
    "then @xmath68 and @xmath41 are distinct valuations .    from the construction before , where we showed that @xmath41 converges on any @xmath71",
    ", we can find sufficiently large @xmath48 so that for all @xmath72 , there exists a shortest path from @xmath73 to @xmath60 going through @xmath74 .",
    "( we can assume @xmath75 , since if so we can just pick a larger @xmath48 . )",
    "but now we have @xmath76 for all",
    "@xmath72 , and so @xmath77 .",
    "so each element of @xmath0 corresponds to a distinct point in the cayley compactification @xmath58 , which justifies the nomenclature of this object as a compactification of the original graph ( or group . )",
    "the interesting part comes in determining which geodesics induce distinct valuations , and what the space of distinct valuations looks like ; this varies depending on the set of generators @xmath1 .",
    "we define the boundary of the cayley compactification , @xmath78 , to consist of the valuations @xmath41 inside of the cayley compactification .",
    "the main question can then be posed as follows :    for a given @xmath8 , what does the boundary @xmath78 look like ?    in general , this is a very difficult question , which we will investigate in section  [ boundary ] .",
    "we can narrow the question down a bit by making the following definition and corresponding observations .    if we have two geodesics @xmath37 and @xmath79 such that @xmath80 as valuations on the function algebra @xmath21 , then we call @xmath37 and @xmath79 * equivalent*. the boundary @xmath78 then consists of the equivalence classes of geodesics under this notion of equivalence .    if @xmath37 and @xmath79 are geodesics that share an infinite set of vertices , then they are equivalent",
    ".    when determining the set of @xmath41 , it suffices to consider full geodesics , since any infinite geodesic is contained in a full geodesic simply by taking the union of paths between @xmath74 and @xmath73 , where @xmath48 and @xmath81 are consecutive in the indexing set @xmath35 , arranged in increasing order .",
    "since the cayley graphs are translation - invariant , it follows that the natural group action of @xmath0 on itself extends to the cayley compactification @xmath58 . when determining whether or not a sequence of elements comprises a full geodesic , the only thing of importance is therefore the differences between successive elements ; we make the following natural definitions .",
    "a geodesic @xmath37 * contains * a multiset @xmath26 of generators if the elements @xmath82 contain that multiset .",
    "the * direction * of a geodesic @xmath37 is defined to be the subset of generators which appear infinitely often among the elements @xmath82 .    still , the space of full geodesics is large , and in general is difficult to parametrize .",
    "we can cut down the space significantly by using lemmas such as the following , which has an easy direct proof .",
    "we state this fact now so as to allow us to compute examples before developing the machinery .    [ minimal ]",
    "let @xmath0 be an abelian group , @xmath83 .",
    "then if @xmath84 can be written as the sum of fewer than @xmath85 generators , no full geodesic @xmath37 in the cayley graph @xmath8 can contain @xmath86 .",
    "suppose @xmath37 contains @xmath87 .",
    "pick @xmath48 sufficiently large that the multiset @xmath88 contains all of these elements with multiplicities . by definition of a geodesic ,",
    "we know that the shortest path between @xmath74 and @xmath89 goes through all intermediate @xmath73 , having length @xmath48 ; in particular , @xmath90 can not be expressed as the sum of fewer than @xmath48 generators .",
    "however , we can replace the @xmath85 elements @xmath87 with fewer than @xmath85 generators in the sum for @xmath90 , a contradiction .",
    "having proven some preliminary results which allow us to compute cayley compactifications in specific cases , we present some examples of cayley compactifications , which illustrate their general structure as well as a variety of behaviors that can occur .",
    "_ example 1 . _",
    "let @xmath91 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the standard basis .",
    "if @xmath37 is a full geodesic , by lemma  [ minimal ] , @xmath37 can not contain both @xmath95 and @xmath96 or both @xmath97 and @xmath98 . by symmetry",
    ", it suffices to consider the case where @xmath37 contains only @xmath95 and @xmath97 ( by reflection we will obtain all the other full geodesics . )",
    "we break this down into three cases .",
    "@xmath37 contains infinitely many @xmath95 and infinitely many @xmath97 .",
    "we claim that all such @xmath37 induce the same valuation @xmath41 .",
    "because of lemma  [ genonly ] , it suffices to check this on functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "but for any such @xmath37 and a given @xmath101 , eventually all points in @xmath37 are of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and so we will have @xmath105 , and similarly @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "so we have @xmath108 for both of these cases , regardless of what @xmath37 is in this class .",
    "consequently , all such @xmath41 are the same , and evaluate to @xmath109 on all such functions .",
    "@xmath37 contains infinitely many @xmath97 and finitely many @xmath95 , say @xmath85 of them . because they necessarily share an infinite set of vertices",
    ", @xmath37 is equivalent to the full geodesic @xmath110 .",
    "again , we evaluate @xmath41 on the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the calculation is easy in both cases ; we end up with @xmath111 if @xmath112 and @xmath113 otherwise , and @xmath114 regardless .",
    "@xmath37 contains infinitely many @xmath95 and @xmath85 copies of @xmath97 .",
    "this is isomorphic to the previous case , and yields @xmath111 always , and @xmath114 if @xmath115 and @xmath113 otherwise .",
    "as you can see , all geodesics obtained in these three cases are distinct ; it is easy to check that their symmetric images ( using @xmath96 and/or @xmath98 in place of @xmath95 and @xmath97 respectively ) are also distinct from each other and from these @xmath41 .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting cayley compactification .",
    "[ figone ]    the drawing of the figure reflects the topology of the situation ; the geodesics @xmath110 converge ( as @xmath85 gets large ) to the geodesic with infinitely many of both @xmath95 and @xmath97 .",
    "this example reflects one phenomenon of the cayley compactification .",
    "the boundary @xmath78 is the boundary of the polytope polar to the one defined by the generators @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this is not a coincidence , and it s easy to see how it arises ; anything `` between '' @xmath95 and @xmath97 resulted in the same point , while infinitely taking @xmath95 resulted in a facet of geodesics , one for each translation of @xmath95 by a finite combination of the other basis vectors .",
    "as the next two examples show , it is not generally the case that the boundary of the cayley compactification is simply equal to the boundary of the polar polytope in some geometric sense .",
    "rather , in general , the boundary of the cayley compactification has components that look like the boundary of the polar polytope , spliced together ; we will prove a more rigorous statement to this effect in section  [ boundary ] .",
    "_ example 2 .",
    "_ let @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "as before , thanks to lemma  [ minimal ] , no full geodesic can contain both @xmath120 , both @xmath121 , or more than four copies of either @xmath122 or @xmath113 .",
    "consequently , the only full geodesics contain infinitely many copies of either @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "it suffices to discuss the @xmath123 case .",
    "if a full geodesic contains finitely many items that are nt @xmath123 , then as before it is equivalent to some geodesic @xmath125 , with @xmath126 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath127 for @xmath128 , simply by evaluating them on @xmath129 .",
    "the geodesics with infinitely many @xmath124 s are also easily seen to be distinct from these .",
    "so , we have eight distinct geodesics in either direction ; the cayley compactification is depicted in figure 2 .",
    "[ figtwo ]    in this case , we obtain eight copies of the boundary of the polar polytope , which can be represented as @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the lattice generated by @xmath123 is not saturated ; each of the eight copies corresponds to a coset of this lattice group , an element of @xmath132 .",
    "_ example 3 .",
    "_ let @xmath91 , @xmath133 , where we have @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath134 .",
    "this example combines both of the previous ones . on the one hand",
    ", we have the polar polytope corresponding to the convex hull of the basis elements , which is a hexagon .",
    "this shows up as follows : the geodesics fall into two categories .",
    "one is families ; you have families in the @xmath135 direction , in the @xmath136 direction , and in the @xmath137 direction , and all of their negatives ; these are the six 1-faces of the hexagon , corresponding to the four sides of the square from example 1 .",
    "the other corresponds to the four corners of the square in example 1 ; we have six corners now , one corresponding to geodesics with infinitely many of @xmath135 and @xmath137 , the adjacent ones corresponding to geodesics with infinitely many of @xmath137 and @xmath136 or @xmath135 and @xmath138 , and so on .",
    "all of these geodesics are equivalent ; this can be shown directly , and it also falls out as a consequence of results to follow .    on the other hand , as in example 2 , there is also a so - called torsion part in @xmath78 , and it shows up in an odd way .",
    "note that we have two `` overlapping '' ( though of course they do nt overlap in the cayley graph , but in the picture they do ) geodesics in the @xmath137 direction : for instance , the geodesics @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , all geodesics in this direction ( or its negative ) come in such pairs .    as in example 2 , you might think that the boundary would comprise two copies of the polytope ( as we had eight before ) .",
    "however , it is more complicated than that ; we do in fact have two copies of each face , but they fit together in interesting ways . for instance , the subsequences of geodesics with direction @xmath137 which converge to a geodesic containing two generators infinitely often are interlaced , as depicted in figure 3 .",
    "[ figthree ]    having presented these examples which hopefully illustrate the intuitive idea of what cayley compactifications look like , we move on to approaches for investigating them",
    ". we will present two approaches : a geometric approach using polytopes , which is simpler and works better in the case of @xmath2 ( which is embedded in @xmath141 ) , and an algebraic approach using standard pairs , which works in a more general setting .",
    "we first present the geometric approach , which gives all of the results that the algebraic approach gives , and more , in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we investigate the shape of the boundary @xmath142 using geometric methods ; throughout this section @xmath143 will denote the polytope which is the convex hull of the vectors in the generating set @xmath1 . note that since @xmath1 generates @xmath6 , 0 is in the interior of @xmath143 .    by truncating a full geodesic @xmath37",
    ", we can assume that the only generators that are contained in @xmath37 are contained in its direction , as truncation obviously preserves equivalence class .",
    "therefore , we can restrict our attention to looking at full geodesics which only contain generators in their direction ; unless otherwise stated , we will assume that this is the case for all geodesics mentioned in the remainder of this section .",
    "furthermore , we have the following very powerful result .",
    "[ basedir ] suppose two full geodesics @xmath144 and @xmath145 with the same direction @xmath146 contain a common point @xmath147",
    ". then @xmath144 and @xmath145 are equivalent",
    ".    our method will be to construct a new geodesic @xmath79 which has infinitely many points in common with both @xmath144 and @xmath145 ; this geodesic will then be equivalent to both of our original geodesics , and so they must be equivalent to each other .",
    "first of all , we can truncate both @xmath144 and @xmath145 at @xmath147 , and thus assume that @xmath147 is the first point of both .",
    "to each point @xmath148 in @xmath144 or @xmath145 , we associate an @xmath149-tuple of nonnegative integers @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the number of times that the generator @xmath152 is contained in the subgeodesic stretching from @xmath147 to @xmath148 ( which is merely a path . ) by construction , these @xmath149-tuples are nondecreasing in each component as we move along the geodesics in question . furthermore , as we move off towards infinity along either @xmath73 , for all @xmath48 , @xmath153 will eventually be arbitrarily large , since each @xmath152 appears infinitely often in @xmath73 .",
    "now , let @xmath154 , where the @xmath155 are from @xmath144 and the @xmath156 from @xmath145 .",
    "we select these points as follows : @xmath157 is any point from @xmath144 .",
    "each @xmath156 is closen so that @xmath158 for all @xmath81 , and similarly each @xmath155 except the first is chosen so that @xmath159 for all @xmath81 .",
    "it is then clear that these points comprise a geodesic , since applying lemma  [ minimal ] to @xmath144 yields that no sum of the @xmath152 s with any multiplicities can be expressed as the sum of fewer generators , which is the only obstruction to @xmath79 being a geodesic .",
    "theorem  [ basedir ] justifies the nomenclature in question ; a geodesic is completely categorized by where it starts and which direction it goes in , as one would expect from the geometry of the situation .",
    "thus , all points which contain a given point @xmath147 and have the same direction @xmath26 are equivalent ; we will write such a geodesic as @xmath160 , and refer to @xmath147 as a * base * of @xmath37 .",
    "the next step is to classify possible directions of geodesics ; we start with an easy lemma .",
    "[ every ] let @xmath147 be a point with rational coordinates in the interior of a rational polytope @xmath143 ( i.e. a polytope all of whose vertices have rational coordinates . )",
    "then there exists an affine combination of all the vertices of @xmath143 with positive rational coefficients which is equal to @xmath147 .",
    "first , we note that it suffices to show that for every vertex @xmath10 of @xmath143 , there exists an affine combination of the vertices of @xmath143 with rational coefficients such that the coefficient of @xmath10 is positive and all other coefficients are nonnegative ; we can then just average all of these combinations to obtain one where all coefficients are positive .    the rest of the proof is by induction on the dimension of @xmath143 .",
    "take any vertex @xmath10 , and consider the ray from @xmath10 to @xmath147 .",
    "this ray intersects @xmath143 beyond @xmath147 , since @xmath147 is in the interior of @xmath143 ; it does so at some point @xmath15 in the interior of some proper face @xmath161 , which is of course a polytope itself . by induction",
    ", @xmath15 can be expressed as an affine combination of the vertices of @xmath161 with rational coefficients .",
    "but now @xmath147 can be expressed as a rational affine combination of @xmath10 and @xmath15 , and since @xmath147 is in the interior of @xmath143 and @xmath15 is not , the coefficient of @xmath10 must be positive .",
    "we have therefore produced an expression for @xmath147 of the desired form .    using this lemma",
    ", we can prove a nice theorem about geodesics that classifies them by their directions .",
    "[ face ] let @xmath37 be a full geodesic . then @xmath37 is equivalent to a geodesic whose direction consists of the vertices of some proper face @xmath161 of @xmath143 .",

    "this is in @xmath143 , because @xmath143 is convex , and we have @xmath164 .",
    "because of theorem  [ basedir ] , @xmath37 is equivalent to a geodesic @xmath79 which starts at the same point as @xmath37 and then repeats this block of generators adding up to @xmath165 ad infinitum .",
    "now , @xmath147 is contained in some face @xmath161 of @xmath143 , so by lemma  [ every ] we can find an affine combination of the vertices of @xmath161 with rational coefficients which is equal to @xmath147 . multiplying through by the common denominator yields that , for some positive integer @xmath166 , we can write @xmath167 as a positive integer linear combination of the vertices of @xmath161 , where the coefficients add up to @xmath166 .    consider blocks of @xmath168 generators of @xmath79 ; by construction , each block adds up to @xmath169 . replace each of these blocks with @xmath149 copies of the expression for @xmath167 in terms of the vertices of @xmath161 ; these copies together will also have @xmath168 generators , and thus the resulting path @xmath170 must also be a geodesic , since @xmath79 is .",
    "furthermore , @xmath170 and @xmath79 share an infinite set of vertices , namely those at intervals of @xmath168 generators .",
    "consequently , @xmath170 is equivalent to @xmath79 , and since the direction of @xmath170 is clearly the vertex set of @xmath161 , the theorem is nearly proven .",

    "theorem  [ topol ] demonstrates that the orbits correspond in this nice topological way to the faces of the polar polytope @xmath3 .",
    "one question remains : what do the orbits look like ?",
    "the answer is relatively simple .    for a face @xmath161 , let @xmath227 be the subgroup of @xmath6 generated by @xmath26 , the set of points of @xmath1 lying on @xmath161 .",
    "then the points of the orbit @xmath198 are in natural bijection with the elements of @xmath228 .",
    "first of all , note that if a geodesic has direction @xmath161 and base @xmath229 , then it is equivalent to a geodesic with direction @xmath26 and base @xmath229 .",
    "this is because for any element @xmath28 , we can write @xmath230 as a sum of vertices of @xmath161 , using @xmath85 in all . consequently , we can rewrite that geodesic using infinitely many copies of @xmath231 . proceeding for every element of @xmath26 which is not a vertex of @xmath161",
    ", we obtain the desired result .",
    "we need to show two things : that two geodesics with direction @xmath26 are equivalent if their bases differ by an element of @xmath227 , and that two geodesics with direction @xmath26 are not equivalent if their bases differ by an element not in @xmath227 .",
    "the first claim is easy .",
    "if two bases @xmath232 and @xmath233 differ by an element of @xmath227 , then we can find @xmath234 and @xmath235 , positive linear combinations of the elements of @xmath26 , such that @xmath236 .",
    "we can then shift generators corresponding to @xmath234 to the front of the geodesic based at @xmath232 , and similarly for @xmath235 and @xmath233 , to show that both geodesics are equivalent to a geodesic with base @xmath237 and direction @xmath26 , and hence equivalent to each other .",
    "next , suppose that we have two equivalent geodesics @xmath144 and @xmath145 with direction @xmath161 and bases @xmath232 and @xmath233 respectively . as usual , let @xmath181 be the face - defining linear functional of @xmath161 , so that we have @xmath238 for @xmath239 with equality holding if and only if @xmath240 .",
    "without loss of generality , by truncating the geodesics we can assume that @xmath232 and @xmath233 satisfy @xmath241 .",
    "first , suppose @xmath242 .",
    "then consider the distance difference function @xmath243 . by the same argument as in the proof of theorem  [ noneq ] , we must have @xmath244 , and @xmath245 , and so in particular these two can not be equivalent .",
    "on the other hand , suppose @xmath246 .",
    "then as before we have @xmath244 and @xmath247 , and so if the two geodesics are equivalent these must in fact both be equal to 0 .",
    "this means that for sufficiently large @xmath149 , the distance from @xmath248 to @xmath233 is the same as the distance from @xmath248 to @xmath232 .",
    "the latter path consists only of elements of @xmath26 since the direction of @xmath144 is @xmath161 ; the former path must consist of the same number of elements , and since we have @xmath246 it follows that it must consist only of generators with @xmath182 , i.e. of elements of @xmath26 .    therefore , @xmath232 and @xmath233 must differ by an integer linear combination of the elements of @xmath26 , which is an element of @xmath227 as desired .",
    "we now have a natural map from the geodesics with direction @xmath161 to the elements of the group @xmath228 , given by taking a geodesic to the coset of @xmath227 in @xmath6 containing all of its points .",
    "in fact , calling @xmath228 a group is somewhat misleading ; there is no natural group structure , since among other things there is no distinguished identity element .",
    "more appropriate is to say that it is a set with a @xmath6-action on it .",
    "since for @xmath249 , we have @xmath250 , we might ask if there is a natural map from @xmath251 to @xmath228 . indeed there is , and it is the one you would expect , the induced map between the sets as quotients of @xmath6 ; this map , on the geodesics , is given by preserving the base and changing the direction .",
    "this clearly preserves the @xmath6-action ; the preimage of a point in @xmath228 is therefore just an @xmath227-orbit in @xmath251 , whose compactification in @xmath193 contains the image point in question .",
    "furthermore , we can use this classification of points in @xmath193 to prove that cayley compactifications are actually compact .",
    "the cayley compactification @xmath193 is compact for any choice of generating set @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that any infinite sequence has a convergent subsequence .",
    "suppose we have an infinite sequence ; because there are finitely many faces @xmath161 , some infinite subsequence must be contained in an orbit @xmath198 .",
    "so it suffices to show that any infinite sequence of geodesics with the same direction has a convergent subsequence .    for any such geodesic @xmath37 with direction @xmath161 , for sufficiently large @xmath48",
    ", a shortest path from 0 to @xmath74 will consist of a shortest path from 0 to @xmath252 , followed by a path from @xmath252 to @xmath74 .",
    "the second part of this consists only of elements of @xmath161 , so to each @xmath37 we can associate ( not necessarily uniquely ) a sum of generators not in @xmath161 , which can not be expressed as the sum of fewer generators .",
    "suppose we have an infinite sequence of geodesics with direction @xmath161 .",
    "then for each generator @xmath253 , either the coefficient of @xmath147 in the associated sum grows infinitely large , or there is some finite value of this coefficient which occurs infinitely often .",
    "thus , we can find a subsequence for which for each @xmath239 , either the coefficient of @xmath147 in the associated sums for these geodesics grows monotonically , or the coefficient of @xmath147 in these sums is constant . if @xmath26 is the set of generators for which the coefficient grows monotonically , then by a previous argument these geodesics converge to one with direction @xmath254 , based at any point on any of these geodesics .",
    "consequently , we have found a convergent subsequence , proving compactness .",
    "we have given a relatively complete description of the cayley compactification using geometric arguments in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "in the next section , we present a different method which will work in a more general case , although it does not give as complete results in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we introduce commutative algebra methods , specifically standard pair decompositions , that allow us to attack the question of cayley compactifications in a more general setting : in particular , when the group in question is not @xmath6 , and when the generators have different weights ( which corresponds to the edges of the cayley graph having different lengths depending on which generator they arise from . ) the language here also makes some of the proofs above simpler ; we present both versions of those proofs so as to betterdemonstrate the mechanics of both approaches .    given a cayley graph @xmath8",
    ", we can form its cayley ideal as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be a cayley graph .",
    "the cayley ideal @xmath255 is defined to be the kernel of the algebra homomorphism @xmath256\\rightarrow k[g]$ ] sending each generator @xmath257 to the monomial @xmath258 . here ,",
    "@xmath256 $ ] is the free algebra with one generator for every element of @xmath1 , while @xmath259 $ ] is the group algebra with one generator @xmath260 for each element @xmath261 , and relations @xmath262 whenever @xmath263 .",
    "the cayley ideal is a binomial ideal , where each binomial represents two different paths from 0 to a given point .",
    "we can therefore obtain a copy of the set of points by considering a basis of monomial generators ( monomials represent a product of generators , which corresponds to a point in @xmath0 ) for @xmath256/i(s)$ ] as a @xmath85-vector space . a canonical way to do",
    "this is as follows : compute a grbner basis for the ideal @xmath264 , with respect to some cost vector @xmath265 , where @xmath266 represents the weight ( i.e. length in the cayley graph ) of the generator .",
    "assuming @xmath265 is generic , this yields the initial monomial ideal @xmath267 .",
    "we recall the definition of a standard pair decomposition  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath268 $ ] be a monomial ideal .",
    "a pair @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is a monomial and @xmath26 is a subset of the variables , is defined to be a standard pair of @xmath271 if the following conditions hold .",
    "\\(a ) all monomials of the form @xmath272 are standard monomials ( monomials not contained in @xmath271 ) , where each @xmath273 is in @xmath26 ,    \\(b ) no variable appearing in the set @xmath26 appears in the monomial @xmath270 , and    \\(c ) @xmath274 is not properly contained in any other set with properties ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is clear from the definition that the union of the standard pairs of @xmath271 consists precisely of all the standard monomials of @xmath271 .",
    "we now claim that this standard pair decomposition of @xmath267 gives us the elements of the cayley compactification @xmath58 in a natural way .",
    "[ stdmon ] the points of @xmath0 are in natural one - to - one correspondence with the standard monomials of @xmath256/i(s)$ ] .",
    "a monomial in @xmath256 $ ] represents a linear combination of generators ; two linear combinations of generators represent the same point in @xmath0 if and only if the difference of the corresponding monomials is in @xmath264 . because @xmath1 generates @xmath0 , each point can be represented as a linear combination of generators .",
    "but the set of standard monomials includes exactly one representative from each equivalence class of monomials in @xmath256/i(s)$ ] , and hence exactly one representative for each point in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the correspondence is natural , giving a shortest path from @xmath275 to that point in the weighted cayley graph @xmath58 .    because of lemma  [ stdmon ] , by abuse of notation we will also consider the standard pairs as sets of points in @xmath0 .    now , suppose we have an infinite geodesic",
    ". there are only a finite number of standard pairs , so there must be some standard pair containing infinitely many points from that geodesic ; the subset of the geodesic contained in this standard pair is a geodesic which is equivalent to the original one .",
    "thus , when investigating the rest of the points in the cayley compactification , we need only consider the geodesics whose points are entirely contained in a standard pair .",
    "suppose @xmath40 is a geodesic contained entirely in a standard pair @xmath276 .",
    "then @xmath37 is equivalent to some geodesic @xmath79 with the property that for each @xmath48 , @xmath277 , one of the following is be the case :    \\(a ) the exponent of @xmath257 in @xmath278 is constant , or    \\(b ) the exponent of @xmath257 in @xmath278 grows monotonously without bound as @xmath81 gets large .",
    "suppose @xmath37 does not satisfy this property ; suppose it violates it for @xmath279 different values of @xmath48",
    ". we will induct on @xmath279 .",
    "take any @xmath48 for which the exponent of @xmath257 in @xmath37 fails to obey either condition .",
    "if the exponent of @xmath257 in @xmath37 gets arbitrarily large , then we can find a subsequence of @xmath37 where this exponent is strictly increasing ; this subsequence will then obey the property for the same values @xmath37 did , as well as for @xmath48 , so it will violate the property for at most @xmath280 different values of @xmath48 . by induction , we are now done .    if not ,",
    "then the exponent of @xmath257 in the infinite sequence @xmath37 is bounded , so there exists some value it takes infinitely often .",
    "take the subsequence of @xmath37 where it takes this value ; this will again obey the property for the same values @xmath37 did , as well as for @xmath48 , and we are again done by induction .",
    "this further restricts the realm of geodesics .",
    "all infinite geodesics are equivalent to one contained in a standard pair @xmath281 , and furthermore all are equivalent to a geodesic @xmath40 where we have @xmath282 where @xmath283 is some monomial in the standard pair not containing any of the @xmath284 , the @xmath284 are a subset of the @xmath285 , and @xmath286 for @xmath49 . because of theorem  [ basedir ] from section  [ boundary ] , all such geodesics with a point in common are equivalent . in fact , since we can prepend @xmath283 to any geodesic , all such geodesics with identical @xmath283 s are equivalent ; we call @xmath283 the * base * of the geodesic @xmath37",
    ".    therefore , using this standard pair decomposition , we can enumerate all of the points in the cayley compactification , simply by considering all possibilities for base and direction inside each standard pair .",
    "these possibilities are easy to enumerate ; if @xmath287 is a standard pair , then the base - direction pairs are in one - to - one correspondence with expressions @xmath288 , where the @xmath260 range over @xmath289 .",
    "unfortunately , if the cost vector is not generic , it is not necessarily true that all of these geodesics are distinct .",
    "indeed , we have the following example .",
    "_ example 4 .",
    "_ consider the cayley graph @xmath290 , where we have @xmath93 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293 .",
    "the cayley compactification of this is essentially a 4-gon , via the methods of section  [ boundary ] .",
    "however , the algebraic approach yields a different answer .",
    "the standard pairs of the ideal @xmath264 include @xmath294 and @xmath295 ; we claim that the geodesics these code for are equivalent .",
    "indeed , it is relatively easy to check by hand that for a given @xmath296 , along each of these geodesics its limit is equal to the horizontal distance between @xmath147 and @xmath15 .    while this method does not always work",
    ", it does generically give a complete answer .",
    "suppose that the cost vector is generic in the sense that @xmath267 is a monomial ideal .",
    "then no geodesics with different base or direction are equivalent .",
    "suppose first that our two geodesics @xmath297 and @xmath298 have different directions ; suppose without loss of generality that @xmath299 appears in @xmath26 but not @xmath300 .",
    "pick a point @xmath147 from @xmath144 sufficiently far out that the exponent of @xmath299 in @xmath147 is higher than the exponent of @xmath299 in @xmath283 ; pick any point @xmath15 on @xmath145 .",
    "now , we will consider the limit of the function @xmath296 along @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "along @xmath144 past @xmath147 , the distance from a point @xmath155 to @xmath147 is just @xmath301 , since both are standard monomials and @xmath155 is a multiple of @xmath147 .    because @xmath155 is a standard monomial ,",
    "the distance from @xmath155 to @xmath15 is at least @xmath302 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath303 sufficiently far out along @xmath145 , the distance from @xmath303 to @xmath15 is at @xmath304 , while @xmath305 is at least @xmath306 .",
    "if @xmath144 and @xmath145 are equivalent , then we must for sufficiently large @xmath48 and @xmath81 have @xmath307 ; plugging in the above information , the only way this can happen is if we have @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "this means that in the cayley graph , there exists a path of length @xmath306 between @xmath147 and @xmath303 .",
    "this path corresponds to a monomial @xmath310 of this degree .",
    "when we multiply this monomial by @xmath147 , we get another representation of degree @xmath311 for @xmath303",
    ". it can not be the same representation , since we chose @xmath147 such that the exponent of @xmath299 was higher in @xmath147 ( and thus in @xmath312 ) than in @xmath303 .",
    "so we have two distinct monomials of the same degree whose difference is in @xmath264 , one of which is a standard monomial ; this is impossible , since the cost vector is generic .",
    "the argument in the case where the directions are the same and the bases are different is identical ; as our point @xmath147 , we simply pick whichever of @xmath270 and @xmath283 has a higher power of some element @xmath25 .",
    "this element will then have a higher power of @xmath313 than any element in the other geodesic , since by construction the variables appearing in the base and the direction to not overlap .",
    "the result then follows as in the first case .",
    "this allows us to effectively compute the cayley compactification in the general case of an abelian group @xmath0 and a generic cost vector .",
    "the proof that the cayley compactification is actually compact is easy with this approach ; it is parallel to the proof we presented in section  [ boundary ] .    for an abelian group @xmath0 , and any set of weighted generators @xmath1",
    ", the cayley compactification @xmath58 is compact .",
    "take any sequence of points in @xmath58 ; we must show it has a convergent subsequence .",
    "each point in the cayley compactification belongs to a standard pair ; there are only finitely many standard pairs , so some pair @xmath314 must contain an infinite subsequence . now , recall that points of @xmath58 correspond to expressions @xmath315 , where @xmath316 for all @xmath48 .",
    "all that remains is an elementary argument : either we can find a subsequence @xmath317 where the value of @xmath95 increases monotonously without bound , or we can find one where the value of @xmath95 is a constant .",
    "we can now do this for each variable @xmath260 in turn to obtain a convergent subsequence ( if some @xmath260 increases without bound then the limit has @xmath318 ; otherwise the limit has whatever value of @xmath260 all the elements do . )",
    "while we have used only undirected cayley graphs for ease of notation , essentially everything we have said in this paper holds for cayley digraphs , where the generators yield directed edges rather than edges , and we do not have @xmath7 .",
    "however , the case of nonabelian groups is somewhat different ; what can be said in this case ?    if we have a homomorphism between a group @xmath0 with generating set @xmath1 and a group @xmath319 with generating set @xmath26 , and @xmath1 maps to @xmath26 , there ought to be a relation of some kind between the cayley compactifications .",
    "there are obstacles to this , however ; geodesics in @xmath0 may not map to geodesics in @xmath319 .",
