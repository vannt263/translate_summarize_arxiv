    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is one of the simplest and most interesting spacetimes allowed by general relativity .",
    "quantum field theory in this background has been discussed by several authors ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "much of early interest to ads spacetime was motivated by the questions of principle related to the quantization of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "the importance of this theoretical work increased when it was realized that ads spacetime emerges as a stable ground state solution in extended supergravity and kaluza - klein models and in string theories .",
    "the appearance of the ads / cft correspondence and braneworld models of randall - sundrum type has revived interest in this subject considerably .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence ( for a review see @xcite ) represents a realization of the holographic principle and relates string theories or supergravity in the bulk of ads with a conformal field theory living on its boundary .",
    "it has many interesting formal and physical facets and provides a powerful tool to investigate gauge field theories , in particular qcd .",
    "recently it has been suggested that the introduction of compactified extra spatial dimensions may provide a solution to the hierarchy problem between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales @xcite . the main idea to resolve",
    "the large hierarchy is that the small coupling of four dimensional gravity is generated by the large physical volume of extra dimensions .",
    "these theories provide a novel setting for discussing phenomenological and cosmological issues related to extra dimensions .",
    "the model introduced by randall and sundrum is particularly attractive .",
    "their background solution consists of two parallel flat branes , one with positive tension and another with negative tension embedded in a five dimensional ads bulk @xcite .",
    "the fifth coordinate is compactified on @xmath1 , and the branes are on the two fixed points .",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and only the gravity propagates freely in the five dimensional bulk . in this model ,",
    "the hierarchy problem is solved if the distance between the branes is about 40 times the ads radius and we live on the negative tension brane .",
    "more recently , scenarios with additional bulk fields have been considered @xcite .    in the scenario presented in @xcite the distance between the branes",
    "is associated with the vacuum expectation value of a massless scalar field , called the radion .",
    "this modulus field has zero potential and consequently the distance is not determined by the dynamics of the model . for this scenario to be relevant ,",
    "it is necessary to find a mechanism for generating a potential to stabilize the distance between the branes .",
    "classical stabilization forces due to the non - trivial background configurations of a scalar field along an extra dimension were first discussed by gell - mann and zwiebach @xcite . with the revived interest in extra dimensions and braneworlds , as modified version of this mechanism , which exploits a classical force due to a bulk scalar field with different interactions with the branes , received significant attention @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "another possibility for the stabilization mechanism arises due to the vacuum force generated by the quantum fluctuations about a constant background of a bulk field .",
    "the braneworld corresponds to a manifold with dynamical boundaries and all fields which propagate in the bulk will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum energy ( for the casimir effect see refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) , and as a result to the vacuum forces acting on the branes . in dependence of the type of a field and boundary conditions imposed ,",
    "these forces can either stabilize or destabilize the braneworld .",
    "in addition , the casimir energy gives a contribution to both the brane and bulk cosmological constants and , hence , has to be taken into account in the self - consistent formulation of the braneworld dynamics .",
    "motivated by these , the role of quantum effects in braneworld scenarios has received some recent attention . for a conformally coupled scalar this effect",
    "was initially studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of m - theory , and subsequently in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite for a background randall  sundrum geometry ( for the related heat kernel expansions see refs .",
    "the models with ds branes are considered as well @xcite . for a conformally coupled bulk scalar the cosmological backreaction of the casimir energy is investigated in refs . @xcite .",
    "investigation of local physical characteristics in the casimir effect , such as expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor , is of considerable interest .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source in the einstein equations and therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field . in this paper we will study the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling parameter obeying robin boundary conditions on two parallel plates in @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "the general case is considered when the constants in the robin boundary conditions are different for separate plates .",
    "robin type conditions are an extension of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions and appear in a variety of situations , including the considerations of vacuum effects for a confined charged scalar field in external fields @xcite , spinor and gauge field theories , quantum gravity and supergravity @xcite .",
    "robin conditions can be made conformally invariant , while purely - neumann conditions can not .",
    "thus , robin - type conditions are needed when one deals with conformally invariant theories in the presence of boundaries and wishes to preserve this invariance .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quantum scalar field satisfying the robin condition on the boundary of the cavity violates the bekenstein s entropy - to - energy bound near certain points in the space of the parameter defining the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the robin boundary conditions are an extension of those imposed on perfectly conducting boundaries and may , in some geometries , be useful for depicting the finite penetration of the field into the boundary with the skin - depth parameter related to the robin coefficient .",
    "mixed boundary conditions naturally arise for scalar and fermion bulk fields in the randall - sundrum model @xcite . to obtain the expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor",
    ", we first construct the positive frequency wightman function .",
    "the application of the generalized abel - plana formula to the corresponding mode sum allows us to extract manifestly the boundary - free ads part .",
    "the expressions for the boundary induced vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor are obtained by applying on the subtracted part a certain second order differential operator and taking the coincidence limit . note",
    "that the wightman function is also important in consideration of the response of particle detectors at a given state of motion ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider the vacuum in the region between two parallel plates .",
    "the corresponding positive frequency wightman function is evaluated by using the generalized abel - plana summation formula for the series over zeros of a combination of cylinder functions .",
    "this allows us to present the boundary induced part in terms of integrals with exponential convergence for the points away the boundaries . in section [ sec : cd1b ] we consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for the case of a single plate .",
    "both regions on the right and on the left from the plate are investigated .",
    "various limiting cases are discussed .",
    "section [ sec:2branes ] is devoted to the vacuum energy - momentum tensor for the geometry of two parallel plates .",
    "the corresponding vacuum expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of single plates and interference parts .",
    "the latter is finite everywhere including the points on the boundaries .",
    "the interaction forces between the plates are discussed as well . in section [ sec : ransum ] we show that the vacuum expectation value for the energy - momentum tensor of a bulk scalar in the randall  sundrum braneworld scenario is obtained from our results as a special case .",
    "the last section contains a summary of the work .",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath2 on background of a @xmath0-dimensional plane - symmetric spacetime with the line element @xmath3 and with @xmath4 being the metric for the @xmath5-dimensional minkowski spacetime . here and below @xmath6 , and",
    "the corresponding field equation has the form @xmath8 where the symbol @xmath9 is the operator for the covariant derivative associated with the metric @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the corresponding ricci scalar , and @xmath12 is the curvature coupling parameter . for minimally and conformally coupled scalars",

    "the presence of boundaries modifies the spectrum for the zero  point fluctuations of the scalar field under consideration .",
    "this leads to the modification of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of physical quantities to compared with the case without boundaries .",
    "in particular , vacuum forces arise acting on the boundaries .",
    "this is well known casimir effect . as a first stage , in this section we will consider the positive frequency wightman function defined as the expectation value @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the amplitude for the vacuum state . in the next section we use this function to evaluate the vevs for the energy ",
