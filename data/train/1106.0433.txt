    "compact binary systems in globular clusters ( gcs ) are an important target for observations .",
    "many of these systems , unlike primordial field binaries , are thought to be formed dynamically  for example , via three - body encounters and exchange interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  often leading to very close binaries , possibly with different properties relative to their counterparts in the field .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are compact binaries comprising a white dwarf primary accreting from a low - mass roche - lobe - filling secondary companion , usually through an accretion disc .",
    "an increase in mass - transfer through the disc can lead to a brightening of the system of several magnitudes , known as a dwarf nova ( dn ) eruption .",
    "so far , relatively few dn outbursts of globular cluster cvs have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the predicted populations of such systems .",
    "@xcite predict from numerical simulations that the number of cvs per unit mass should be 23 times _ higher _ in gc cores than in the field .",
    "@xcite estimate the number of erupting cvs per unit mass in the solar neighbourhood to be @xmath0 per .",
    "however , they find that the number of cvs per unit mass in gcs which have been observed to undergo dn eruptions is significantly ( @xmath1 times ) _ smaller _ than in the local field .",
    "it is likely that selection effects play a role in this apparent discrepancy .",
    "for example , @xcite notes that out of 531 field cvs with known orbital periods , those systems discovered through their variability are comprised of 86 per cent classical and dwarf novae , whereas more than one half of the 121 x - ray selected systems in the sample are magnetic systems , which erupt relatively infrequently , if at all . on the other hand",
    "it is plausible that despite the role of selection effects , the observational evidence for a lack of outbursts in gc cvs nevertheless reflects an underlying difference in the nature of the cluster cvs compared to field cvs .    as well as the bright gc x - ray sources ( @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ) which have been identified with low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; * ?",
    "* ) , a population of fainter ( @xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 ) x - ray sources in a number of gcs has been more recently identified as being composed of a significant proportion of cvs . using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , @xcite optically identified the first sample of cvs in a gc , coinciding with a population of _ rosat _ x - ray sources in ngc6397 @xcite  the current number of cv identifications in the cluster is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the largest sample of cvs ( 22 ) in a gc has been identified in 47 tuc ( for a list of the observations , see * ? ? ?",
    "this number compares favourably ( within a factor of 2 ) to the theoretical prediction of @xcite of 3540 _ detectable _ cvs ( and up to 200 total cvs ) in a 47 tuc - like gc ( where observational limits for field cvs are imposed to define detectability ) . the confirmed cv populations in these and other gcs allow us to compare the properties of these predominantly dynamically - formed gc cvs to those of primordial field cvs and also to theoretical models .",
    "it appears there is some evidence for a cv population in gcs with different characteristics to the field population .",
    "many gc cvs have higher x - ray luminosities than field cvs @xcite , for instance .",
    "many also exhibit x - ray to optical flux ratios higher than those typically seen in field cvs ( this was found in the case of the 47 tuc cvs by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicative of dwarf novae  but in contradiction to the aforementioned dearth of observed dn eruptions .",
    "furthermore , the presence of heii emission lines in the _ hst _ spectra of some gc cvs suggests a possible magnetic nature ( as proposed for cvs in ngc6397 by * ? ? ?",
    "these globular cluster cvs are difficult to observe from the ground in their quiescent state due to their intrinsic faintness and their crowded location in the densely populated cluster cores .",
    "gc cv candidates have thus far typically been identified on the basis of their x - ray or far - uv emission ( with optical follow - up observations needed for confirmation ) and , in fewer instances , the presence of the more definitive dn outbursts . while the resolving power of _ hst _ is needed for the detailed optical photometric or spectral analysis necessary for conclusive classication of these crowded sources , the advent of image - subtraction software such as @xcite allows us to search for eruptions of these systems from the ground .",
    "cv1 is located in the crowded central region of the nearby ( 3.2  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) globular cluster , m22 .",
    "previously , @xcite interpreted a @xmath63  mag brightening of the source in 1999 may as gravitational microlensing of a background bulge star by a low - mass foreground cluster object .",
    "subsequent analysis of _ hst _ archival data by @xcite , including proper - motion studies confirming the object as a cluster member , prompted them to reclassify the object as a cluster cv which had undergone a dwarf nova eruption during the observations by @xcite .",
    "they also found that , in optical colours , the star is unusually red for a cv , with ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) colours about 0.2 and 0.1  mag redward of the main sequence , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported two outbursts of the object occurring during 20022003 from ground - based _",
    "i_-band observations during that epoch .",
    "the outburst amplitudes were @xmath9  mag and the full width at half - maximum of the duration ( measurable for one outburst only ) was approximately 14  d. in another ground - based study , @xcite reported a further two outbursts of cv1 ",
    "one occurring in 2000 august / september , with a duration of @xmath10  d and the other event , for which they had incomplete data coverage , in 2001 june .",
    "more recently @xcite have suggested that cv1 may be not be a cv , but could instead be a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) that exhibits outbursts .",
    "we studied m22 cv1 with the aim of placing a new constraint on the outburst frequency as well as further exploring the broadband optical colours and investigating the x - ray properties to see if a quiescent lmxb ( qlmxb ) identification could be ruled out for the source .",
    "we report on a long - term ground - based optical monitoring programme of m22 during which an outburst of cv1 was detected and we also present archival _",
    "hst _ photometry and analysis of the x - ray properties of the object .",
    "although the dwarf nova v101 lies at the greater distance of 7.5  kpc from us in the globular cluster m5 @xcite , its atypical location ten core radii from the centre of the cluster and lack of close neighbours allow it to be studied spectroscopically from the ground .",
    "a review of the available literature on v101 was given by @xcite . from",
    "ground - based _",
    "i_-band observations they determined the orbital period of the system to be p@xmath11  h  the first orbital period determination for a dwarf nova in a globular cluster . the only literature on the source since that time is the report by @xcite of the detection of two new outbursts in 2003 and 2004 as part of their cluster ages experiment ( case ) , as well as two previous outbursts in 1997 , which had already been reported by @xcite in their ground - based study of the cluster .",
    "we present an optical multiwavelength study of the m5 dwarf nova , v101 , in an attempt to confirm its orbital period and identify the spectral type of the secondary .",
    "the m22 ground - based dataset consists of _ v _ and _ b_-band images covering the period of 2004 march ",
    "november , taken with the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) 1.3-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , chile .",
    "the @xmath12  pixel andicam detector used for the observations has a pixel scale of 0.369  arcsec  pixel@xmath3 and a @xmath13  arcmin@xmath14 field of view .",
    "the images are centred on the core of the globular cluster with a sampling of approximately two 300-s _ v_-band exposures every second night for most of the observing programme , increasing during may to two exposures per night in both the _ v _ and _ b _ bands as soon as the outbursting object was discovered .",
    "due to severe crowding effects at the cluster core and the faintness of the cv ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : m22full ] and [ fig : m22smarts ] ) , standard photometric reduction techniques such as aperture and profile - fitting photometry could not be performed on the source .",
    "for example , even small aperture photometry would be contaminated by light from neighbouring stars . also posing",
    "a problem was the uncertain level of the sky background , which can vary quite strongly in such crowded regions due to , for one , faint unresolved background stars .",
    "moreover , the crowded nature of the entire image meant it was impossible to construct a model point spread function of sufficient quality for profile - fitting photometry .",
    "the photometry was instead performed using the image - subtraction software @xcite . using the programs in this package ,",
    "the images were first aligned with each other by remapping on to a common grid . a reference image for subtraction was created by combining the ten per cent of the images with the best seeing .",
    "this reference image was then convolved with a spatially varying kernel to degrade its seeing to match the seeing of each individual image in turn .",
    "each individual image was then subtracted from the appropriately convolved reference image , with the result of creating a subtracted image containing the residuals ( the outbursting cv is obvious in these subtracted images  see fig .",
    "[ fig : m22smarts ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "all the subtracted images were median - combined to produce an image , _",
    "var.fits_ , showing  in theory  only the variable stars , which appear as stellar - like profiles . in practice ,",
    "saturated stars and cosmic rays lead to many spurious detections .",
    "the light curve of the cv was extracted from the subtracted images in the _ v _ and _ b _ bands using the routine packaged with and plotted in units of differential flux relative to the reference image in which the cv was in quiescence .        [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "previously @xcite found @xmath15 for a power law fit to archival _ xmm - newton _ x - ray spectral data for the source ; in addition they found an even softer power law photon index if they added a gaussian absorption line at 1  kev , which improved their fit .",
    "they interpreted this absorption line as possible electron cyclotron resonance in a neutron star pulsar .",
    "the lack of any evidence for such an absorption line in our data weakens the case for a neutron star pulsar ( or lmxb ) identification for cv1 .",
    "the hardness of the x - ray colour of the object , @xmath16 , is also more consistent with a cv than a quiescent lmxb .",
    "thus , based on these x - ray properties of the system , it appears much more like a cv than a qlmxb .",
    "we also calculated the x - ray luminosity in the _ chandra _ acis 0.310  kev band , @xmath17  erg  s@xmath3 , and found it is at the high end of the range of x - ray luminosities for non - magnetic dwarf novae , but is typical for the magnetic ips .",
    "our best - fitting power - law spectrum is relatively hard , with photon index @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between cv subtype and x - ray spectrum and luminosity for a sample of cvs comprising confirmed magnetic cvs ( ips and polars ) , quiescent dn and nova - like cvs ( nl ) and globular cluster cvs .",
    "they found the distribution of photon index differed significantly between magnetic cvs , which are harder x - ray sources ( mean @xmath19 , and non - magnetic cvs ( mean @xmath20 , but was fairly consistent within either group .",
    "the cluster sources were found to comprise @xmath21 per cent magnetic systems , based on the photon index distribution .",
    "our measured photon index of @xmath18 places cv1 on the borderline between the magnetic and non - magnetic distributions .",
    "however , the combination of our result with the photon index result of @xcite , which , although consistent with our value , ranges to softer values , tips the balance slightly in favour of a non - magnetic cv classification for the object .      in the optical ,",
    "the characteristics of the @xmath615-d 2004 may outburst of m22 cv1 covered by our observations are consistent with previous reports of @xmath61520  d , 23  mag eruptions of the system by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these outburst characteristics are also consistent with normal outbursts of dn , which typically have durations from 220  d @xcite , where this duration is also correlated with the recurrence time for outbursts .",
    "@xcite estimated the outburst recurrence time for cv1 to be greater than 150  d  our observations are consistent with this limit .",
    "the typical duration of outbursts of cv1 , at 1520  d , would tend to favour a longer orbital period estimate of the order of 10  h or more ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the outburst properties of cv1 are not unlike those of non - magnetic dwarf novae of longer orbital period , such as bv cen , which undergoes outbursts with an amplitude of @xmath22  mag and a 30-d duration separated by 150  d ( although these tend to be more symmetrical in rise and decay than those of cv1 ) .",
    "if _ magnetic _ , cv1 can not be a polar because their absent discs preclude outbursts .",
    "on the other hand , intermediate polars ( ips )  with their partially truncated inner discs  do exhibit outbursts .",
    "however , the outburst characteristics of cv1 are not consistent with any particular example of the known ips .",
    "gk per , with its infrequent outbursts which persist for two months , remains an anomalous system .",
    "other ip systems such as ex hya exhibit a similar outburst amplitude to cv1 , @xmath23  mag , but these outbursts last only 23  d and have a longer recurrence time of @xmath24  yr @xcite , while ips such as tv col and v1223 sgr show even shorter duration low - amplitude outbursts that last only @xmath25  d. thus , on the basis of its outburst properties , cv1 does not resemble a magnetic system .",
    "we can also eliminate the _",
    "su uma _ class based on the morphology of the outburst light curve : even though our sampling is too sparse to detect superhumps ( the modulation which is the defining characteristic of the su uma class ) in the ouburst light curve , we find no evidence for the extended , sloping plateau of brightness associated with superoutbursts .",
    "similarly , @xcite found no evidence for the presence of superhumps in the 2000 august outburst light curve .",
    "this leaves the longer - period _ u gem_-type dn as the group of cvs with the most similar properties to cv1 ( e.g. bv cen ) .",
    "@xcite show that for a sample of field dn , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 colours are well correlated with orbital period , with those systems having @xmath28  h being significantly bluer than those with @xmath29  h. conversely , for the same sample , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 colours do not appear to be well correlated with @xmath32 . based on its @xmath33 colour of @xmath34  mag",
    ", cv1 appears to be consistent with having @xmath35  h. the blackbody temperature of @xmath36  k inferred from the @xmath33 colour is consistent with emission from the accretion disc .",
    "@xcite found that the ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) colours of cv1 are unusually red for a cv , about 0.2  mag and 0.1  mag redward of the main sequence , respectively .",
    "a possible explanation for these red colours , previously mentioned by @xcite , is that a secondary larger than a normal main - sequence star dominates the optical emission of the system .",
    "@xcite show that for longer orbital period ( @xmath39  h ) cvs , the degree of nuclear evolution of the secondary is crucial in setting its spectral type , with the most evolved donors having spectral types significantly later than their main - sequence analogues .",
    "some degree of nuclear evolution of the donor off the main sequence could explain the location of cv1 in the cmds of @xcite .",
    "an enhanced contribution to the _",
    "v_-band from such a secondary might also explain the relatively low uv excess inferred from the ( @xmath40 ) colour ( see section  [ sec : colours ] ) .",
    "although an established example of an evolved globular cluster cv secondary may be found in the dwarf nova ako  9 in 47 tuc ( see the cmds of @xcite ; @xcite and the calculations of @xcite ) , the ( @xmath8 ) colours of many other globular cluster cvs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest a lesser , if any , degree of nuclear evolution of the donors in these systems .",
    "we note that the location of cv1 on the ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) cmds of @xcite , together with its uv and x - ray colours , could also be explained if cv1 were part of a hierarchical triple system in which the third star were a main - sequence star of mass comparable to the secondary star in cv1 .",
    "it would be of interest to determine whether such a system could survive in the core of m22 .",
    "alternatively , the ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) colours could be accounted for by the presence of a line - of - sight main - sequence star .",
    "the relatively low density of stars in the vicinity of cv1 in the _ hst _ image make this unlikely , but it can not be ruled out .",
    "a useful discriminant of the subtype of a cv is the ratio of x - ray to ultra - violet and/or optical flux .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the different classes of cv can be subdivided as follows : su uma and u gem - type cvs , @xmath41/@xmath42 ; @xmath43/@xmath44 for z cam - type cvs ; finally , ux uma - type ( or _ novalike _ ) cvs have the lowest ratios at @xmath41/@xmath45 .    calculating the ratio of x - ray to uv plus optical flux in an equivalent manner for cv1",
    ", we find @xmath46/@xmath470.07 ( where the discrepancy with the result of @xcite arises from the inclusion of the uv flux here ) .",
    "this value again suggests a u gem classification for cv1 .",
    "the orbital period distribution of cvs typically ranges from tens of minutes up to about 15  h. the value of @xmath32 for a cv can reveal much about the parameters of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whilst it is challenging to directly measure the orbital period for a system as faint and crowded as cv1 in m22 , we can none the less attempt to constrain it by comparing the optical , uv and x - ray properties of the system to those of galactic cvs with known orbital periods .",
    "for example , the absolute magnitude at minimum of the source , @xmath48  mag @xcite , suggests an orbital period of @xmath49  h ( see equation 18 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the increased uv luminosity of cvs at longer orbital periods due to their correspondingly higher accretion rates @xcite , and the lack of any clear correlation between x - ray luminosity and orbital period , it would seem reasonable to expect a correlation between @xmath41/@xmath50 and orbital period for non - magnetic cvs .",
    "in fact , @xcite have found evidence for such a correlation : their fig .",
    "6 shows that for a sample of non - magnetic field cvs , with increasing orbital period there is a trend of decreasing @xmath46/@xmath51 .    interestingly however , our @xmath46/@xmath51 value for cv1 places it in the region of the @xcite plot with @xmath52  h , in contradiction to our previous orbital - period constraints .",
    "we discuss below two ways in which this could be resolved :    1 .   taking the contradiction with the van  teesling results at face value , one way to accommodate such a short orbital period would be to invoke the presence of a cooler ( redder ) line - of - sight interloper or a companion in a triple system .",
    "then the intrinsically fainter , bluer cv would be more consistent with a shorter @xmath32 . in order to revise the @xmath32 estimate using the relationship from @xcite down to @xmath53  h , an absolute magnitude at minimum as faint as @xmath69  mag",
    "would be required .",
    "however , given the measured h@xmath54 excess of 0.54  mag @xcite , a fainter cv would have a larger h@xmath54 excess translating to an unfeasibly large equivalent width of @xmath55   for the emission line , making this an unlikely explanation .",
    "2 .   a more likely explanation comes from a closer examination of the data used by @xcite : none of these systems are , in fact , u gem types ( the solitary datum of this class , ei uma , has since been reclassified as an ip @xcite ) .    hence , we conclude that our classification of cv1 as a dwarf nova of u gem type remains secure .",
    "strong heii @xmath56   line emission is characteristic of magnetic cvs ( in polars , it is comparable in strength to h@xmath57 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ips , for example , this high - excitation line is most likely powered by x - ray heating of the regions of the accretion curtains close to the magnetic poles , interior to the inner edge of the magnetically truncated accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the strong hei , h@xmath58 and balmer emission ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : redspec ] and [ fig : bluespec ] ) of v101 are characteristic of cvs in quiescence , while the lack of any obvious heii emission  an upper limit of @xmath59   can be placed on the equivalent width of any heii @xmath60   emission in the spectrum  suggests that the system is unlikely to be magnetic .",
    "the enhanced contribution of the accretion disc to the luminosity of the system at shorter wavelengths means we would expect the absorption lines of the secondary star to be more apparent at longer wavelengths .",
    "the only possible absorption feature from the secondary which can be identified in our summed spectrum is a weak feature at 7118   , although we can not be certain this is not an artefact .",
    "our phased optical light curves in the _ r _ and _ r _ bands show varying degrees of modulation at the orbital period of @xcite .",
    "the main peak in the light curve may be due to the hotspot ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "comparing our @xmath46/@xmath61 to the trend in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , as we did for m22 cv1 , again we find that for our result , their trend would predict a shorter orbital period of up to a maximum of around three hours , compared to the measured @xmath62  h @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is not as pronounced as what we found for the m22 cv , although in that case we did not have a measured @xmath32 to compare with . however , again we note the lack of u gem - type systems in the @xcite sample .",
    "for m22 cv1 , the x - ray properties confirm a cv rather than an lmxb nature . the high @xmath63 and x - ray spectral hardness are indicative of either a quiescent dn or an ip .",
    "the outburst characteristics are consistent with a normal long @xmath32 ( @xmath64  h ) dwarf nova of u gem type , but can not be very easily reconciled with any particular example of the known ips .",
    "we find the expected uv excess compared to the cluster main sequence in @xmath65 versus ( @xmath66 ) , and that the ( @xmath40 ) colour is consistent with a longer orbital period .    for the m5 cv , v101 , our optical spectra are typical for a quiescent dwarf nova .",
    "the lack of any significant heii emission suggests the system is not magnetic .",
    "the modulation we observe in the _ r_-band light curve is consistent with the orbital period of @xmath67  h found by @xcite .",
    "as this remains the globular cluster cv most amenable to detailed study from the ground in quiescence , it will benefit from future higher s / n phase - resolved optical spectroscopy .",

    "<S> as a class of compact binaries with large binding energy , cataclysmic variables formed through close encounters play an important role in the dynamical evolution of globular clusters . as part of a systematic search for cvs undergoing dwarf nova eruptions in globular clusters , our 2004 monitoring programme of m22 detected an outburst of the dwarf nova candidate cv1 during may . </S>",
    "<S> we implement the image subtraction routine to obtain a light curve for an outburst of cv1 . </S>",
    "<S> we present the outburst light curve as well as _ </S>",
    "<S> photometry in the _ v _ , _ u _ and near ultra - violet ( _ nuv _ ) bands and a _ chandra_/acis - s spectrum of the object . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the dn nature of the outburst and the cv status of the object . </S>",
