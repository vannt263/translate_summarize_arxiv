    "in species sampling problems , one is interested in the species composition of a certain population ( of plants , animals , genes , etc . ) containing an unknown number of species and only a sample drawn from it is available .",
    "the relevance of such problems in ecology , biology and , more recently , in genomics and bioinformatics is not surprising . from an inferential perspective , one is willing to use available data in order to evaluate some quantities of practical interest .",
    "the available data specifically consist of a so - called _ basic sample _ of size @xmath0 , @xmath1 , which exhibits @xmath2 distinct species , @xmath3 , with respective frequencies @xmath4 , where clearly @xmath5 .",
    "given a basic sample , interest mainly lies in estimating the number of new species , @xmath6 , to be observed in an additional sample @xmath7 of size  @xmath8 and not included among the @xmath9 s , @xmath10 .",
    "most of the contributions in the literature that address this issue rely on a frequentist approach ( see @xcite for reviews ) and only recently an alternative bayesian nonparametric approach has been set forth ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter resorts to a general class of discrete random probability measures , termed _",
    "species sampling models _ and introduced by j.  pitman in @xcite . given a nonatomic probability measure @xmath11 on some complete and separable metric space @xmath12 , endowed with the borel @xmath13-field @xmath14",
    ", a ( proper ) species sampling model on @xmath15 is a random probability measure @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random elements taking values in @xmath12 and with probability distribution @xmath11 , the nonnegative random weights @xmath18 are independent from @xmath17 and are such that @xmath19 , almost surely . in the species sampling context , the @xmath20 s act as species tags and @xmath21 is the random proportion with which the @xmath22th species is present in the population . if @xmath23 is an exchangeable sequence directed by a species sampling model @xmath24 , that is , for every @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath14 one has @xmath27=\\prod_{i=1}^n \\tilde p(a_i)\\ ] ] almost surely , then @xmath23 is termed _ species sampling sequence_. besides being an effective tool for statistical inference , species sampling models have an appealing structural property established in @xcite .",
    "indeed , if @xmath23 is a species sampling sequence , then there exists a collection of nonnegative weights @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , for any vector of positive integers @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32=p_{k_n+1,n}(n_1,\\ldots , n_{k_n})p_0 ( \\cdot)+\\sum_{j=1}^{k_n } p_{j , n}(n_1,\\ldots , n_{k_n } ) \\delta_{x^*_j } ( \\cdot),\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a sample with @xmath34 distinct values @xmath35 .",
    "statistical applications involving species sampling models for different purposes than those of the present paper are provided , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the bayesian nonparametric approach we undertake postulates that the data are exchangeable and generated by a species sampling model .",
    "then , conditionally on the basic sample of size @xmath0 , inference is to be made on the number @xmath36 of new distinct species that will be observed in the additional sample of size @xmath8 .",
    "interest lies in providing both a point estimate and a measure of uncertainty , in the form of a credible interval , for @xmath36 given @xmath1 .",
    "since the conditional distribution of @xmath36 becomes intractable for large sizes @xmath8 of the additional sample , one is led to studying its limiting behaviour as @xmath8 increases .",
    "such asymptotic results , in addition to providing useful approximations to the required estimators , are also of independent theoretical interest since they provide useful insight on the behaviour of the models we focus on .",
    "the only discrete random probability measure for which a conditional asymptotic result , similar to the one investigated in this paper , is known , is the two - parameter poisson ",
    "dirichlet process , shortly denoted as @xmath37 . according to @xcite ,",
    "a @xmath37 process is a species sampling model characterized by=-1 @xmath38=0 with @xmath10 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this case , @xcite provide a result describing the conditional limiting behaviour of @xmath36 . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on an alternative species sampling model , termed _ normalized generalized gamma process _ in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , it depends on two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath41 and , for the sake of brevity , is denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , it is characterized by @xmath43 for any @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the @xmath42 process prior has gained some attention in the bayesian literature and it has proved to be useful for various applications such as those considered , for example , in @xcite . it is to be noted that the @xmath46 does not feature a posterior structure that is as tractable as the one associated to the @xmath47 process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . nonetheless , in terms of practical implementation , it is possible to devise efficient simulation algorithms that allow for a full bayesian analysis within models based on a @xmath42 prior .",
    "see @xcite for a review of such algorithms .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we will specify the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath36 , given the basic sample , as @xmath8 diverges and highlight the interplay between the conditional distributions of the @xmath37 and the @xmath42 processes . since the posterior characterization of a @xmath42 process is far more involved than the one associated to the @xmath47 process ,",
    "the derivation of the conditional asymptotic results considered in this paper is technically more challenging .",
    "this is quite interesting since it suggests that it is possible to study the limiting conditional behaviour of @xmath36 even beyond species sampling models sharing some sort of conjugacy property .",
    "for example , one might conjecture that the same asymptotic regime , up to certain transformations of the limiting random variable , should hold also for the wide class of gibbs - type priors , to be recalled in section  [ section2 ] .",
    "an up to date account of bayesian nonparametrics can be found in the monograph @xcite and , in particular for asymptotic studies , @xcite provides a review of asymptotics of nonparametric models in terms of `` frequentist consistency . ''",
    "yet another type of asymptotic results are obtained in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    ", one can find a basic introduction to species sampling models and a recollection of some results in the literature concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the number @xmath48 of distinct species in the basic sample , as @xmath0 increases .",
    "section  [ section3 ] displays the main results , whereas the last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "let us start by providing a succinct description of completely random measures ( crm ) before defining the specific models we will consider and which can be derived as suitable transformations of crms .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of discrete nonparametric models defined in terms of crms .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is a random element defined on some probability space @xmath50 and taking values on the space @xmath51 of boundedly finite measures on @xmath15 such that for any @xmath52 in @xmath14 , with @xmath53 for @xmath54 , the random variables @xmath55 are mutually independent",
    ". then @xmath49 is termed _ completely random measure _ ( crm ) .",
    "it is well - known that the laplace functional transform of @xmath49 has a simple representation of the type @xmath56=\\mathrm { e}^{-\\psi(f)},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}s , \\mathrm{d } y)$ ] for any measurable function @xmath58 such that @xmath59 almost surely and the measure @xmath60 on @xmath61 is known as the lvy intensity of @xmath49 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "since a crm is almost surely discrete , any crm can be represented as @xmath62 with independent random jump locations @xmath17 and heights @xmath63 . for our purposes , it is enough to focus on the special case of @xmath60 factorizing as @xmath64 , which implies independence of the locations @xmath20 s and jumps @xmath65 s in the above series representation .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 can be taken to be nonatomic and finite , the latter ensuring almost sure finiteness of the corresponding crm .",
    "now , if @xmath67 for any @xmath68 , one can define a random probability measure on @xmath12 as @xmath69 this family of random probability measures is known from @xcite as homogeneous normalized random measure with independent increments , a subclass of the general class of normalized processes introduced in @xcite .",
    "note that an @xmath12-valued exchangeable sequence @xmath23 generated by @xmath24 as in ( [ eqnrmi ] ) is a species sampling sequence .    here",
    "we focus on a specific example where the crm defining @xmath24 in ( [ eqnrmi ] ) is the so - called _ generalized gamma process _ @xcite that is characterized by @xmath70 with @xmath39 and @xmath71 . in this case , @xmath72 \\alpha ( \\mathrm{d}x ) \\label{eqlaplexpon}\\ ] ] for any measurable function @xmath73 such that @xmath74 . in the sequel",
    "the model will be reparameterized , without loss of generality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , by setting @xmath75 and @xmath66 as a probability measure .",
    "the corresponding crm will be denoted by @xmath76 . henceforth , the random probability measure @xmath24 obtained by normalizing @xmath76 as in ( [ eqnrmi ] ) coincides , in distribution , with the @xmath77 process prior .",
    "an important special case arises when @xmath78 , since @xmath79 reduces to the @xmath13-stable process , which plays a key role within the paper .",
    "for example , it is worth noting that @xmath80 can also be defined as an exponential tilting of @xmath81 , for any @xmath82 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath83 is the probability distribution of @xmath81 on @xmath84 and @xmath85 is a probability measure on @xmath86 that is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath83 and such that @xmath87 then @xmath85 coincides with the probability distribution of @xmath76 . in a similar fashion",
    ", one can also define the @xmath37 process as a polynomial tilting of @xmath81 , for any @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , one introduces another probability measure @xmath88 that is still absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath89 and whose radon  nykodim derivative is @xmath90^{-\\theta}\\ ] ] for any @xmath39 and @xmath40 . if @xmath91 is the random measure with probability distribution @xmath92 above , then @xmath93 coincides , in distribution , with a @xmath37 process .",
    "see @xcite . the different tilting structure featured by the normalized generalized gamma process and the two parameter poisson  dirichlet process",
    "will be reflected by the limiting results to be illustrated in the paper .",
    "it is also worth to recall that both the @xmath42 and the @xmath37 processes can be seen as elements of the general class of _ gibbs - type _ nonparametric priors introduced in  @xcite .",
    "gibbs - type priors represent the most tractable subclass of species sampling models .",
    "they are characterized by a parameter @xmath94 and a collection of non - negative quantities @xmath95 that satisfy the forward recursive relations @xmath96 these @xmath97 s define the predictive weights that characterize a species sampling sequence governed by a gibbs - type prior .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath98 for each @xmath44 .",
    "the fundamental simplification involved in ( [ eqweightsgibbs ] ) is that the probability of observing a `` new '' or an `` old '' species depend on the sample size and on the number of already observed distinct species but not on their frequencies : this crucially simplifies explicit calculations .",
    "turning to the two specific processes introduced before , in accordance with ( [ eqpesi0 ] ) , the @xmath37 process identifies a gibbs - type prior with @xmath99 whereas , in accordance with ( [ eqpesi ] ) and ( [ eqpesi1 ] ) , a @xmath42 prior is also of gibbs - type with @xmath100 and @xmath101 as shown in @xcite , a normalized crm is a gibbs - type prior ( with @xmath39 ) if and only if it is a @xmath42 process .",
    "this result also motivates the focus of the paper on the @xmath77 process , which clearly has a prominent role .",
    "the result on the limiting behaviour of @xmath36 to be determined in the next section parallels known results for the unconditional case where one aims at determining the asymptotics of @xmath34 as the sample size @xmath0 increases and connects to the conditional asymptotics displayed in @xcite for the @xmath37 process . in order to describe the result for the unconditional case , let @xmath102 be the random total mass of a @xmath13-stable crm and denote by @xmath103 its density function which satisfies @xmath104 for any @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath106 be the random total mass of @xmath107 process and recall that its law can be obtained by exponentially tilting the probability distribution of @xmath108 as in ( [ eqexpontilt ] ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath109 then its density function , with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath110 , coincides with @xmath111 and one has that @xmath112 according to the terminology introduced by @xcite , the random variable @xmath113 is the so - called @xmath13-_diversity _ of the exchangeable random partition induced by a @xmath42 process prior .",
    "see also definition 3.10 in pitman @xcite .",
    "note that a similar result holds true for the @xmath37 process .",
    "indeed , if @xmath114 so that its probability distribution is obtained by polynomially tilting the probability distribution of @xmath108 as in ( [ eqpolytilt ] ) and @xmath115 admits density function @xmath116 then one has @xmath117 see @xcite , theorem 3.8 .",
    "these results are somehow in line with the fact that the @xmath42 and the @xmath118 processes are distributionally equivalent to normalized random measures that are obtained by an exponential and a polynomial tilting , respectively , of a @xmath13-stable crm as highlighted in ( [ eqexpontilt ] ) and in ( [ eqpolytilt ] ) .",
    "finally , note that a combination of @xcite , theorem 12 , and @xcite , proposition 13 , shows that the unconditional asymptotic results in ( [ eqdiversity ] ) and ( [ eqdiversitypd ] ) can be extended to the whole class of gibbs - type priors .",
    "see also @xcite for another contribution at the interface between bayesian nonparametrics and gibbs - type random partitions .",
    "as mentioned before , inference on @xmath36 is of great importance since it provides a measure of species richness of a community of plants / animals or of a cdna library for gene discovery . the key quantity for obtaining posterior inferences",
    "is given by the probability distribution @xmath119 $ ] for @xmath120 . by virtue of predictive sufficiency of the number @xmath34 of distinct species observed among the first @xmath0 data @xmath33 , in @xcite it has been shown that in the @xmath77 this distribution coincides with @xmath121 \\nonumber \\\\[-8pt ] \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & \\frac{\\mathscr{g}(m , k;\\sigma ,-",

    "see @xcite for a comprehensive account on generalized factorial coefficients .",
    "expression ( [ posteriordistinct ] ) can be interpreted as the `` posterior '' probability distribution of the number of distinct new species to be observed in a further sample of size @xmath8 .",
    "now , based on ( [ posteriordistinct ] ) , one obtains the expected number of new species as @xmath124=\\sum _ { k=0}^{m}kp_{m}^{(n , j)}(k),\\ ] ] which corresponds to the bayes estimator of @xmath125 under quadratic loss .",
    "moreover , a measure of uncertainty of the point estimate @xmath126 can be obtained in terms of @xmath127-credible intervals that is , by determining an interval @xmath128 with @xmath129 such that @xmath130 \\geq\\alpha$ ] .",
    "the interval @xmath128 of shortest length is then typically referred to as highest posterior density interval .",
    "the main advantage of the distribution ( [ posteriordistinct ] ) is that it is explicit .",
    "however , since the sum of incomplete gamma functions can not be further simplified , its computation can become overwhelming even for moderately large sizes of @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "this fact represents a major problem in the frequent practical situations in which the size of the additional sample of interest is large . for instance , in genomic applications one has to deal with relevant portions of cdna libraries which typically consist of millions of genes .",
    "hence , it is natural to study the asymptotics for @xmath125 , given @xmath48 , as @xmath131 , in order to obtain approximations of ( [ posteriordistinct ] ) and , consequently , also of ( [ posteriormean ] ) and of the corresponding highest posterior density intervals .",
    "indeed , if one is able to show that a suitable rescaling of @xmath125 , given @xmath48 , converges in law to some random variable , one can use the probability distribution of this limiting random quantity in order to derive the desired approximations .",
    "the statement of the main result in the paper involves a positive random variable @xmath132 whose density function is , for any @xmath133 , @xmath134 and we @xmath135 to denote a beta random variable with parameters @xmath136 .",

    "another interesting case is represented by the normalized generalized gamma process with parameter @xmath205 which yield to the so - called normalized inverse - gaussian processes @xcite . in particular , for the @xmath206 process the density @xmath207 in ( [ density ] ) is known explicitly and the previous expression can be simplified to @xmath208      since the above described limiting distributions can not be easily handled for practical purposes , it is useful to devise a simulation algorithm . in this respect , one can adapt , similarly to @xcite , an exact sampling algorithm recently devised by @xcite for random variate generation from polynomially and exponentially tilted @xmath13-stable distributions .",
    "this will allow to sample the limiting random variables @xmath209 and @xmath144 corresponding to the @xmath194 and to the @xmath42 case , respectively .",
    "indeed , note that @xmath210 is a scale mixture involving a beta random variable @xmath211 and a positive random variable @xmath199 .",
    "the latter is such that its transformation @xmath212 admits density function of the form @xmath213 which is precisely the density function of a polynomially tilted @xmath214-stable distribution .",
    "therefore , random variate generation from @xmath210 can be easily done by independently sampling from a beta random variable with parameter @xmath215 and from a random variable with density function ( [ polynomialtilted ] ) by means of the algorithm devised in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an alternative sampling algorithm for @xmath209 via augmentation .",
    "similar arguments can be applied in order to sample from the limit random variable @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , observe that @xmath144 is characterized by a density function proportional to @xmath216 with @xmath140 being the density function of the random variable @xmath217 .",
    "therefore , in order to sample from the distribution of @xmath144 one can apply a simple rejection sampling .",

    "proposition  [ poststable ] allows one to draw an interesting comparison between unconditional and conditional limits of the number of distinct species . as we have already highlighted in section  [ section2 ] , the probability distribution of the @xmath13diversities for the @xmath42 process and the @xmath194 process arise as a power transformation ( involving the parameter @xmath13 ) of a suitable tilting of the probability distribution of @xmath236 .",
    "we are now in the position to show that a similar structure carries over when one deals with the conditional case .",
    "resorting to the notation set forth in theorem  [ limitresult ] , let @xmath237 to be a random variable whose law coincides with the probability distribution of the conditional total mass @xmath108 of a @xmath214-stable process given a sample of size @xmath0 containing @xmath34 distinct species .",
    "hence , from the laplace transform ( [ condition ] ) in the proof of theorem [ limitresult ] one can easily spot the following identity @xmath238 let now @xmath159 and @xmath239 be the conditional probability distributions of , respectively , the @xmath13-stable @xmath240 and the generalized gamma @xmath241 processes . according to theorem  [ limitresult ] , the probability distributions @xmath159 and @xmath242 are mutually absolutely continuous giving rise to the conditional counterpart of the identity ( [ eqexpontilt ] ) , that is , @xmath243 for any @xmath39 and @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , if we denote by @xmath244 the random variable whose probability distribution is obtained by exponentially tilting the probability distribution of @xmath237 as in ( [ tiltingesponenziale ] ) , then one can establish that @xmath245 in other terms , one can easily verify that the probability distribution of the limit random variable @xmath144 in ( [ result ] ) can be also derived by applying to the probability distribution of @xmath246 the same transformation characterizing the corresponding unconditional case . in a similar fashion , one can also derive the conditional counterpart of the identity ( [ eqpolytilt ] ) for the two parameter poisson  dirichlet process . indeed",
