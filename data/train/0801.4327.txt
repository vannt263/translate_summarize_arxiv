    "the properties of the @xmath0 interacting fermions are still largely unknown , despite the tremendous effort devoted to their understanding in the last years .",
    "one of the most debated questions is on the possible existence of a _ luttinger liquid phase _ , first suggested by anderson [ 1 ] as an explanation of some properties of high @xmath1 superconductors , as observed also in recent experiments , see e.g. [ 2 ] .",
    "it has been proved , in the case of symmetric , smooth and convex fermi surfaces ( like in the jellium model [ 3 ] or in the hubbard model in the non half filled case [ 4 ] ) , that the wave function renormalization @xmath2 is essentially temperature independent up to exponentially small temperatures . as in a luttinger liquid",
    "one expects instead a logarithmic behavior in this regime , @xmath3 , such results rule out for sure the possibility of luttinger liquid behavior .    on the contrary",
    "the presence in the fermi surface of flat regions can produce non fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the simplest model with a flat fermi surface is the 2d hubbard model at half filling , in which the fermi surface is a square .",
    "it was proved in [ 5 ] that the wave function renormalization is @xmath4 up to exponentially small temperatures ; the presence of the @xmath5 is a consequence of the van hove singularities , related to the fact that the fermi velocity is vanishing at the corners of the squared fermi surface , and implies that also such a model does _ not _ show luttinger liquid behavior .",
    "it is important to stress that the results in [ 3],[4],[5 ] are rigorous as they are based on expansions which are _ convergent _ provided that the temperature is not too low , the finite temperature acting as an infrared cut - offs ; however such expansions can not give any information on the zero temperature properties .",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted in recent years to the zero temperature properties of fermi surfaces with flat regions and no corners , which share some features with the fermi surfaces of some cuprates as seen in photoemission experiments .",
    "parquet methods results [ 6 ] and perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) analysis [ 7 ] truncated at one loop indicate that , for repulsive interactions , there is no indication of a luttinger liquid phase at zero temperature ; the effective couplings flow toward a strong coupling regime related to the onset of d - wave superconductivity . in a more recent rg analysis truncated at 2 loops [ 8 ]",
    "one still gets a flow to strong coupling , but in some intermediate region some indication of luttinger liquid behavior is found",
    ".    apparently conflicting results are found by applying bosonization : in [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] a model of electrons on a square fermi surface was mapped in a collection of fermions on coupled chains , and it is found that the correlations at zero temperature in momentum space are similar to the one of the luttinger model . a related but somewhat different strategy consists in proposing an exactly solvable 2d analogue of the luttinger model ; this approach was pursued in [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] and again luttinger liquid behavior up to zero temperature was found .",
    "a possible explanation of such conflicting results was suggested in [ 13 ] , postulating the existence for the rg flow , in addition to the trivial fixed point associated to non interacting fermions , of a _ non trivial _ fixed point associated to luttinger behavior , which could be made instable by the presence of marginally relevant operators . in this paper",
    "we provide a quantitative verification of such hypothesis showing explicitely the existence of a line non trivial luttinger fixed points for the rg flow of a system of 2d interacting fermions with a flat fermi surface .",
    "it is would be not possible to derive such result directly from the perturbative expansions , as it is related to cancellations between graphs to all orders of the expansion which are too complex to be seen explicitly ; it is indeed well known that even in 1d ward identities ( wi ) are necessary to prove the existence of a luttinger liquid fixed point [ 14 ] .",
    "our analysis is based on the implementation , in an exact rg approach , of wi with corrections due the the cut - offs introduced in the multiscale analysis , extending a technique already used to establish luttinger liquid behavior in a large class of 1d fermionic systems [ 15],[16 ] or 2d spin systems [ 17 ] .",
    "such methods are the only ones which can be applied to _ non exactly solvable _ models , like the model analyzed in this paper .",

    "a similar analysis can be repeated for the 2-point function .",

    "the flow equation encodes most of the physical properties of the model , but its analysis is extremely complex . some insights can be obtained by truncating the beta function at second order , and by the numerical analysis of the resulting flow by discretization of the fermi surface ; it is found , see [ 6 ] or [ 8],that @xmath93 has a flow which , for certain values of @xmath94 increases and reach the estimated domain of convergence of the series for @xmath95 .",

    "a basic question is about the fixed points of the flow equation ; in particular if there is , in addition to the trivial fixed point @xmath96 , a non trivial fixed point corresponding to luttinger liquid behavior . note first that the set [ is ] g_h(k_-,1,k_-,2,k_-,3)=1l_-(k_1,--k_2,-)_h with @xmath97 constant in @xmath98 , is invariant under the rg flow , in the sense that if @xmath99 has the form , for @xmath84 [ ggg ] 1(v)^3_,, ,  _h_p_-,0 ^+_ , ^-_,+^+_, ^-_,- the same is true for @xmath100 .",

    ". finally , as in [ 16 ]    [ adf ] by inserting , , , , in we get @xmath189 , which means that the effective interaction remain close to initial value for any rg iteration ; a contradiction argument shows that this can be true only if the beta function is asymptotically vanishing : as this beta function is the same of the 2d model with effective couplings ( 30 ) , up to @xmath34 terms , then follows .",
    "we have shown that the rg flow for a system of spinless fermions with flat fermi surface has , in addition to the trivial fixed point , a line of luttinger liquid fixed points , corresponding to vanishing wave function renormalization and anomalous exponents in the 2-point function ; such fixed point is in the invariant set ( 30 ) .",
    "this makes quantitative the analysis in [ 10 ] , in which the existence of a luttinger fixed point in 2d was postulated on the basis of bosonization . with respect to previous perturbative rg analysis , the key novelty is the implementation of wi at each rg iteration , in analogy to what is done in 1d .    of course the other effective interactions should cause flows away from this fixed point . indeed",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the 1d ( spinning ) hubbard model , in which there is a luttinger liquid fixed point in the invariant set obtained setting all but the backscattering and umklapp scattering terms equal to zero ( that is the set @xmath190 in the g - ology notation , see [ 19 ] ) , and a flow to strong coupling regime driven by the backscattering interaction .",
    "we can in any case expect , as in 1d , that even if the luttinger fixed point in 2d is not stable its presence has an important role in the physical properties of the system .",
    "fermi surfaces with flat or almost flat pieces and no van hove singularities are found in the hubbard model with next to nearest neighbor interactions or in the hubbard model close to half filling , and it is likely that our results can be extended , at least partially , to such models .",
    "note however that in such models the sides of the fermi surface are not perfectly flat , so that one expects a renormalization of the shape of the fermi surface , as in [ 3 ] , which is absent in the case of flat sides by symmetry .",
    "another simplifying property of the model considered here is that the modulation of the fermi velocity is taken constant along the fermi surface , contrary to what happens in more realistic models ; a momentum dependent fermi velocity produces extra terms in the wi , as it is evident from ( 43 ) ( @xmath191 should be replaced by @xmath192 in the first line and @xmath193 in the second line ) , and their effect deserves further analysis ."
