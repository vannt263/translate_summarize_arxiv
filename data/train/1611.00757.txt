    "magnetic fields exist in practically all gravitationally bound cosmic structures .",
    "they are seen in galaxies , with strengths of a few micro - gauss ( @xmath9 g ) and coherent over the extent of the galaxy , and in galaxy clusters , where they are of similar strength and extending well beyond the core regions @xcite .",
    "there is also preliminary evidence of magnetic fields coherent on mega - parsec ( mpc ) scales permeating the inter - cluster space @xcite .",
    "the origin of the observed magnetic fields is not fully understood .",
    "the alignment of the galactic magnetic fields with the galactic disc planes suggests that they could be amplified via a dynamo process .",
    "however , the efficiency of the dynamo and the required strength of the initial seed field are still debated .",
    "observations of @xmath9 g strength fields in galaxies at redshifts @xmath10 @xcite add to the problem , as in such cases the dynamo would have only a short time to operate and would require a seed field as large as @xmath11 gauss @xcite .",
    "mechanisms for generation of cosmic magnetic fields can be broadly divided into astrophysical and primordial .",
    "the proposed astrophysical scenarios include induction of fields at recombination @xcite or reionization @xcite , either via the biermann battery effect @xcite or photoionization @xcite , or the combination both @xcite . in primordial scenarios , on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic fields are produced in the very early universe , e.g. during inflation @xcite or in phase transitions @xcite , and subsequently survive in a frozen - in state until the epoch of structure formation and collapse with the matter to seed the galactic fields .",
    "in particular , if the primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) was of nano - gauss ( ng ) strength ( in comoving units ) and coherent over a comoving region of 1mpc , there would be no need for a galactic dynamo , as the compression of the pmf within the proto - galactic halos would naturally produce @xmath9 g strength fields .",
    "pmfs could be produced at several epochs in the early universe , including during and at the end of inflation , as well as in the electroweak and the qcd phase transitions .",
    "while the resultant pmfs tend to be of very small strengths , the understanding of the details of the pmf generation and its subsequent evolution is by no means complete @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether a pmf ends up being necessary for solving the galactic field problem , constraining it provides an observational handle for exploring fundamental physics in the very early universe .",
    "the cleanest window into the pre - recombination universe is provided by the observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "a pmf contributes to cmb anisotropies through metric perturbation sourced by its stress - energy tensor and through the lorentz force felt by the baryons in the plasma @xcite . in particular",
    ", the rotational ( divergence - free ) component of the velocity associated with the lorentz force ( the _ alfvn _ mode ) can cause dominant b - type polarization anisotropies that survive the small scale damping well below the silk scale @xcite .",
    "the pmf also modifies the ionization history of the universe @xcite , affecting the optical depth to the last scattering , although there are remaining uncertainties in modelling it @xcite .",
    "other effects of the pmf on cmb include faraday rotation @xcite and spectral distortions @xcite which are not well constrained by existing observations but are promising as future probes of the pmf .",
    "the specific signatures imprinted by the pmf in the cmb spectra would carry valuable clues about its origin .",
    "for example , a pmf produced in a phase transition would have most of its power concentrated near the cutoff scale set by the plasma conductivity @xcite and could only affect the smallest cmb scales . on the other hand , the originally proposed inflationary models of magnetogenesis @xcite predict a scale - invariant magnetic field , contributing to all observable cmb scales .",
    "the analysis of the 2015 planck data @xcite performed in @xcite limits the magnetic field strength smoothed over @xmath12mpc to @xmath13 ng at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) , with the bound becoming stronger if a particular pmf spectrum is assumed .",
    "prior to that , a comparable bound of @xmath14 ng at the 95% was obtained in @xcite from the combination of the 7-year wmap data @xcite and the high-@xmath0 temperature anisotropy spectrum from the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , a comparable bound of @xmath15 ng was derived by the polarbear collaboration @xcite based on their measurement of the b - mode polarization spectrum .",
    "this demonstrated the potential of the high @xmath0 b - mode measurements for constraining the pmf .",
    "indeed , as we will show in this paper , adding the latest b - mode measurements by the spt @xcite significantly improves on the pmf bounds derived from the planck data alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : pmfimpact ] we discuss how non - helical primordial magnetic fields affect the cmb power spectra , in temperature and polarization . in sec .",
    "[ sect : dataanalysis ] , we derived constraints on the pmf from planck and spt .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] .",
    "the impact of pmfs on cmb anisotropies has been studied in detail in @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we review the main points below . we will neglect effects associated with the faraday rotation of cmb polarization as the planck and the spt data that we consider in this paper are unable to constrain them well .",
    "we consider cmb fluctuations sourced by a stochastic magnetic field generated at a time @xmath16 in the early universe before the time @xmath17 of neutrino decoupling .",
    "we restrict our treatment to linear order in perturbation theory at which the back - reaction of gravity on the pmf is ignored .",
    "we also assume that the unperturbed universe is spatially flat .",
    "the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) limit holds to a good approximation on relevant scales in the highly conducting primeval plasma of the early universe . in this limit ,",
    "the pmf is frozen in the plasma , and evolves according to @xmath18 ( see @xcite for a review ) , where @xmath19 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath20 denotes the present conformal time and @xmath21 is the scale factor normalized to @xmath22 .",
    "conventionally , bounds on cosmological magnetic fields are quoted in terms of the `` comoving '' field strength @xmath23 .",
    "the electric field vanishes in the plasma in the mhd limit and , therefore , the energy - momentum tensor associated with the pmf can be written as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the photon density and pressure , @xmath28 is the magnetic contribution to the radiation density contrast and @xmath29 is the dimensionless anisotropic stress .",
    "note that we assume absence of a homogeneous magnetic field at the background level , as it would break the isotropy of the universe and has already been strongly constrained by cmb @xcite .",
    "the traceless symmetric tensor @xmath30 in eq .",
    ", can be decomposed in its scalar ( s ) , vector ( v ) and tensor ( t ) components @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect pmf to source all metric perturbation modes , including gravitational waves . in fourier space",
    ", the decomposition of @xmath31 reads @xmath32 with the components given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the scalar , vector and tensor harmonic functions @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 are the unit vectors orthogonal to the wave vector @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we model the pmf as a statistically isotropic gaussian distributed random field with the fourier space two - point correlation given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and we neglect the helical contribution . in the special case of a maximally helical pmf , the effect of helicity on the parity - even cmb spectra ( tt , te , ee and bb ) has been shown to be degenerate with a reduction in the overall normalization @xcite , leading to bounds on @xmath43 that are weaker by about @xmath44% @xcite . because of this , adding new unknown parameters to our analysis is not justified .",
    "we note , however , that helical fields also generate parity - odd spectra of eb and tb type @xcite , which could help in breaking the degeneracy with future cmb data .",
    "+    we take the magnetic power spectrum to be a power law , @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and zero otherwise . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the spectral index , which depends on the mechanism that generates the pmf , and @xmath47 is a damping scale below which magnetic fields dissipate due to radiation viscosity @xcite .",
    "the damping scale depends on the amplitude and the spectral index of the pmf spectrum as @xcite @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{n_b+5}},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the baryon density fraction and @xmath50 is the reduced hubble constant , @xmath51 .",
    "we follow the convention in the literature and present the constraints on the pmf amplitude in terms of the smoothed amplitude @xmath52 , obtained by smoothing the magnetic energy density with a gaussian filter over a comoving wavelength @xmath53 , @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "an alternative way of quantifying the amplitude of the pmf is in terms of its contribution to the radiation energy density , given by @xmath56 one can then define the effective magnetic field strength as @xmath57 , and the magnetic fraction of the radiation density as @xmath58 where @xmath26 is the total radiation energy density .",
    "the relations between @xmath59 , @xmath52 and @xmath60 are given by @xcite @xmath61    note that , since the stress energy of the pmf is quadratic in @xmath19 , the magnetic contributions to cmb anisotropies have a non - gaussian statistics . the two point correlation functions of the magnetic energy momentum tensor components @xmath28 and @xmath62 are derived from eq .  .",
    "we show them in appendix  [ sect : calculations ] .      in solving the system of boltzmann and einstein equations",
    ", one needs to set the initial conditions for the scalar , vector and tensor modes .",
    "in boltzmann codes , such as camb , they are set on super - horizon scales , @xmath63 , and well after the neutrino decoupling , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath64 .",
    "after neutrinos decouple from photons , which happens at energies below 1 mev , they free stream and can develop a non - zero anisotropic stress that compensates the anisotropic stress of the pmf .",
    "however , at @xmath65 neutrinos are bound in a tightly coupled fluid with photons and baryons and are unable to compensate for the magnetic anisotropic stress , which then acts as a source of adiabatic scalar and tensor mode perturbations @xcite .",
    "the latter are usually assumed to be uncorrelated with the adiabatic fluctuations generated by inflation and are treated as separate _ passive _",
    "magnetic modes @xcite .",
    "after the neutrino decoupling , pmfs generate isocurvature type perturbations , in which the neutrino anisotropic stress compensates the anisotropic stress of the pmf , known as the _ compensated modes _",
    "it was also realized that , for pmfs generated during inflation , there is another adiabatic mode known as the magnetic inflationary mode @xcite .",
    "however , its amplitude is strongly model - dependent and , in order to keep our approach as model - independent as possible , we restrict our analysis to pmfs generated after inflation , and consider the passive and compensated modes only .",
    "the amplitude of the adiabatic scalar mode is set by the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath66 which , in the absence of a pmf , is conserved on super - hubble scales .",
    "however , as mentioned above , a pmf present before neutrino decoupling would source the growth of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "when neutrinos decouple , their anisotropic stress rapidly grows to compensate the anisotropic stress of the pmf . when the compensation is effective , @xmath66 stops growing , having reached the final value @xcite @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the comoving curvature perturbation at the time @xmath16 , after inflation , at which the pmf was generated . what is commonly referred to as the scalar passive mode ,",
    "is the part of the adiabatic mode associated with the growth of @xmath66 , proportional to @xmath69 , and its power spectrum is proportional to @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the compensated scalar modes start being actively sourced by the pmf after neutrino - decoupling .",
    "there are two such modes , sourced by @xmath28 and @xmath71 , with power spectra proportional to @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the two scalar compensated modes are not independent , as the correlation @xmath74 does not vanish .    since vector perturbations rapidly decay if not continuously sourced , there are no passive vector modes .",
    "the only regular solution for the vector part of the einstein - boltzmann system , with a pmf as an active source , is a compensated mode for which the anisotropic stress @xmath75 is compensated by @xmath76 .",
    "tensor modes , like scalar modes , have both passive and compensated modes . before neutrino decoupling , @xmath77 sources the tensor perturbation , generating the tensor passive mode proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "after neutrino decoupling , the anisotropic stress of the pmf is compensated , leading to the tensor compensated mode .",

    "a change in @xmath3 in the @xmath88 range alters the shape of the cmb spectra , with an increase in @xmath3 causing a shift of power from lower to higher @xmath0 .",
    "this reduces the cmb anisotropy power on scales within the observational window .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath89 , cmb spectra become cutoff dominated and scale as white noise , with the shape being practically independent of @xmath3 . in that regime ,",
    "larger values of @xmath3 lead to more cmb power for the same pmf strength on @xmath12 mpc scale .",
    "the contribution of the magnetic vector mode to the b - mode polarization power spectrum , can be well constrained by the current and future cmb experiments capable of detecting the b - modes from weak lensing . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmodespt ] , the large-@xmath0 measurements of the b - mode polarization performed by the spt can place competitive bounds on the amplitude of the pmf . in fact , as shown later in the paper , they significantly reduce the upper bound obtained from planck .",

    "the upper integration bound of the integrals is the ratio @xmath92 .",
    "we confirmed that , for @xmath93 , the integrals depend weakly on @xmath92 . since the @xmath94 modes involved in the computation of the cmb power spectra are much smaller than the damping scale @xmath95 , we computed the integrals in the approximate limit @xmath96 . for arbitrary @xmath3 in that range ,",

    "we use the measurements of the cmb anisotropies power spectra by the planck satellite @xcite and the measurements of the cmb b - mode polarization by the spt @xcite to constrain the amplitude , the spectral index and the time of generation of the primordial magnetic fields .    for planck ,",

    "such high values of pmf are not allowed because of the pmf vector mode contribution to tt at high @xmath0 .",

    "we have derived the bound on the strength of the primordial magnetic field from the spt cmb b - mode polarization measurements in combination with the cmb temperature and polarization data from planck . adding the spt information significantly tightens the bound , as it constrains the pmf vector mode contribution to b - modes at @xmath116 . specifically , adding the spt data reduces the 95% cl bound on @xmath117 , after marginalizing over the magnetic spectral index @xmath3 , from @xmath118 ng to @xmath119 ng .",

    "future cmb experiments will also constrain the parity - odd tb and eb correlations , leading to meaningful bounds on the helical component of the pmf , which has been neglected in the present work .",
    "they will also tightly constrain the mode - coupling correlations induced by the faraday rotation of cmb polarizations .",
    "the faraday rotation angle is linear in @xmath117 , while cmb anisotropies scale as a square of the pmf strength ( so that the cmb spectra scale as @xmath123 ) , and , with the improved sensitivity and resolution of upcoming experiments , can reduce the upper bound on @xmath117 by an order of magnitude @xcite .    the pioneering work by the polarbear @xcite , bicep / keck @xcite and spt @xcite collaborations has ushered cosmology into the era of precision b - mode science .",

    "<S> a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) present before recombination can leave specific signatures on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations . of particular importance is its contribution to the b - mode polarization power spectrum . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , vortical modes sourced by the pmf can dominate the b - mode power spectrum on small scales , as they survive damping up to a small fraction of the silk length . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of the b - mode polarization at high-@xmath0 , such as the one recently performed by the south pole telescope ( spt ) , have the potential to provide stringent constraints on the pmf . </S>",
    "<S> we use the publicly released spt b - mode polarization spectrum , along with the temperature and polarization data from the planck satellite , to derive constraints on the magnitude , the spectral index and the energy scale at which the pmf was generated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while planck data constrains the magnetic amplitude to @xmath1 ng at 95% confidence level ( cl ) , the spt measurement improves the constraint to @xmath2 ng . the magnetic spectral index , @xmath3 , and the time of the generation of the pmf are unconstrained . </S>",
    "<S> for a nearly scale - invariant pmf , predicted by simplest inflationary magnetogenesis models , the bound from planck+spt is @xmath4 ng at 95% cl . </S>",
    "<S> for pmf with @xmath5 , expected for fields generated in post - inflationary phase transitions , the 95% cl bound is @xmath6 ng , corresponding to the magnetic fraction of the radiation density @xmath7 or the effective field @xmath8 ng . </S>",
    "<S> the patches for the boltzmann code camb and the markov chain monte carlo engine cosmomc , incorporating the pmf effects on cmb , are made publicly available . </S>"
