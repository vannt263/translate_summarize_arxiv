    "resonant tunnelling experiments through zero - dimensional structures are an efficient tool to access their quantized energy levels . in recent years",
    "several groups succeeded in performing such experiments with self - assembled inas quantum dots ( qds ) embedded in the barrier of a single - barrier tunnelling device  @xcite .",
    "low - temperature experiments allowed to measure directly the land factor @xmath0 of inas dots  @xcite . in this note we will report on resonant tunnelling experiments through inas qds in tilted magnetic fields . we will show that @xmath0 depends on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the growth direction and can be described phenomenologically by a tensor with two independent components .",
    "the samples were grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on a highly si - doped gaas substrate with a donor concentration @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "first we grew a 1-@xmath9 m thick gaas buffer layer with the same doping level followed by two 10-nm thick n - doped gaas layers with @xmath10  @xmath8 and @xmath11  @xmath8 and an 15-nm thick undoped gaas spacer . on this bottom electrode",
    "a 10-nm thick alas barrier was deposed .",
    "the growth of the barrier was interrupted at a thickness of 5 nm where 1.8 mono - layers of inas were embedded in the barrier . with such an inas coverage",
    "self - assembled inas qds are formed .",
    "the structure was terminated with a top electrode symmetric to the bottom electrode finishing with 1  @xmath9 m highly n - doped gaas ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ) . as a consequence of the high doping three - dimensional electrodes",
    "are present on both sides of the alas barrier .",
    "subsequent to the growth of the wafer macroscopic augeni contacts with a typical diameter of 50",
    "@xmath9 m were annealed into the top electrode and vertical tunnelling diodes with the same diameter were processed using wet - chemical etching .",
    "when a bias voltage is applied between the top and the bottom electrode our devices show @xmath12-@xmath13-characteristics which can be described by tunnelling through a single alas barrier  @xcite .",
    "superimposed on this coarse @xmath12-@xmath13-curve we observe distinct current steps assigned to resonant tunnelling through individual inas quantum dots  @xcite , for more details see  @xcite . a typical step for @xmath14  k",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ step ] .    in high magnetic fields the current step observed at @xmath15",
    "t develops into two spin - split steps with a voltage separation @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes the lever factor between the energy separation emitter - dot , @xmath18 , and the total voltage drop , @xmath13 . from the temperature",
    "dependent smearing of the current step we deduced @xmath19 .",
    "the spin splitting of the current step is shown in fig .",
    "[ split]a where the @xmath12-@xmath13-characteristic of the tunnelling structure at @xmath20  t is displayed . for the top curve",
    "the magnetic field @xmath21 is oriented along the growth direction @xmath1 , the bottom trace was measured in a magnetic field perpendicular to @xmath1 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ split]b , @xmath22 indeed increases linearly with magnetic field confirming the scenario of a simple zeeman splitting of the qd s energy level .",
    "however , the land factor @xmath0 as deduced from the slope is considerably different for the two field orientations @xmath23 and @xmath5 where we find land factors @xmath24 and @xmath25     . from the temperature dependence of the step heights in high magnetic fields",
    "we find that the low - voltage step can be assigned to tunnelling of spin - down electrons@xcite resulting in a positive @xmath26-factor as also found in  @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it is quite astonishing that the land factor is far away from that of bulk inas ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained qualitatively considering effects of size quantization , strain and possible other effects  @xcite .",
    "such effects may be the leakage of the electronic wave - function in the inas quantum dot into the alas barrier and the space dependent alloying of the inas dots with alas . in a simple picture",
    "this can be described by an ( rather complex ) admixture of the land factor in alas and strained inalas to the ( size - quantized ) @xmath26-factor in the inas - dot .",
    "in order to clarify the dependence of @xmath0 on the orientation of the magnetic field more clearly we have performed experiments in tilted magnetic fields at a temperature @xmath28  k. the angle between the magnetic field and the growth direction was stepped from @xmath29 to @xmath30 . for each angle i - v - curves were recorded at @xmath31  t and the voltage splitting between two spin - split steps was determined . from this",
    "we deduced the angular dependent land factor , @xmath32 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ gvontheta ] . as can be seen in the figure",
    ", @xmath33 gradually increases when tilting the magnetic field away from the growth axis . as indicated with the solid line it follows an angular dependence @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this phenomenological behaviour can be understood when regarding the zeeman contribution to the total energy in a size quantized structure . for the most general case",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath37 were @xmath38 are the three spatial directions , @xmath39 are the components of the magnetic field along @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the bohr magneton and @xmath42 are the pauli spin - matrices . in the most general form",
    "the tensor @xmath43 contains nine independent real components  @xcite .    to get a better physical insight we model our dot by a flat disc with a height @xmath44  nm and a diameter @xmath45  nm  @xcite . in this case",
    "the land tensor reduces to a diagonal tensor with two independent components @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in a tilted magnetic field with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 equation  ( [ gtheta ] ) then directly follows from ( [ h ] ) .",
    "our experiment clearly shows the anisotropic nature of spin splitting in inas quantum dots . comparing with the measured @xmath26-factor anisotropy in quantum - wires  @xcite and quantum wells  @xcite one would expect the largest @xmath26-factor when the magnetic field is applied in the direction of the strongest confinement .",
    "our experiments , however , indicate that this simple relation for the @xmath26-factor anisotropy does not hold .",
    "we observe a smaller @xmath0 if the magnetic field is applied in the growth direction where the quantum confinement is the strongest .",
    "therefore , it is probable that the effects responsible for the @xmath26-factor anisotropies are not dominated by quantum confinement but by more complicated mechanisms such as alas alloying into the inas quantum dots , leakage of the electronic wave function into the alas barriers , spatial dependent strain , spin interactions between the dot and the electrodes etc . without any doubt",
    "more elaborate theoretical models are necessary to clarify the possible origins of @xmath26-factor anisotropies in self - assembled inas quantum dots .",
    "using resonant tunnelling experiments we have measured the land factor tensor of inas quantum dots .",
