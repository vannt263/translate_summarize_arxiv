    "the term `` lattice hadron physics '' has been coined for strong interaction physics based on first principles , i.e. quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in recent years",
    "hadron physics has emerged as a field in its own right @xcite .",
    "the desire to explain strong interaction phenomena in terms of the underlying dynamics of quarks and gluons sets the field apart from traditional nuclear physics , which emphasizes an effective field theory point of view . among the important issues faced by hadron physics",
    "are baryon and meson spectroscopy , and structure , as well as the mechanism of their strong interaction .",
    "those issues have in common the need to deal with excited states . in lattice qcd , which affords the most direct access to hadron physics at nuclear energy scales , excited states spectroscopy",
    "is just now moving into reach due to the use of anisotropic lattices , advanced analysis techniques , and powerful computing facilities .",
    "this work is concerned with learning about hadronic interaction mechanisms .",
    "we believe that much of the physics of hadronic interaction can be understood by investigating heavy - light systems . in those the relative distance of hadrons",
    "is a well defined quantity .",
    "the lattice ` data ' can be interpreted in terms of intuitive pictures , like potentials .",
    "insight into mechanisms of the strong interaction flows from looking at excitations due to hadron - hadron operators , say @xmath0 , at various relative distances @xmath1 .",
    "different choices for the structure of those operators in terms of their composition from quark and gluon fields may potentially point at interesting physics of the system , such as the importance of quark versus gluon exchange degrees of freedom as a function of @xmath1 . to extract information of this kind the computation of matrix elements @xmath2 between the vacuum @xmath3 and ground and excited states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , will be useful .",
    "from the vantage point of a numerical lattice simulation this can be a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "hadron - hadron operators are prone to produce very noisy correlation functions .",
    "extracting spectral information in the standard fashion , i.e. trying to identify a plateau in an effective mass function , may not be practical .",
    "an alternative analysis method that is just being ` discovered ' by lattice practitioners is application of the maximum entropy method ( mem ) or an otherwise constrained form of bayesian inference @xcite . from the bayesian perspective the parameters of a model for the euclidean time correlation function are viewed as random variables drawn from a certain probability distribution function .",
    "the latter , known as the posterior probability @xmath6 $ ] , is the conditional probability for a certain parameter set @xmath7 given a data set @xmath8 . in our case",
    "the data set @xmath8 is the lattice - measured time correlation function @xmath9 and the parameter set @xmath7 is the spectral density function in the model @xmath10 discretization understood , in this approach the number of parameters is allowed to exceed the number of data points without causing conceptual problems . in the mem",
    "the posterior probability is constructed from the @xmath11-distance between the lattice data @xmath8 and the model @xmath12 , and the information content of @xmath7 measured by the entropy @xmath13 .",
    "usually , the result inferred from the bayesian approach is the _ most likely _",
    "parameter set @xmath7 .    analytically , the spectral density function is a sum of discrete @xmath14-peaks @xmath15 from a numerical viewpoint computational constraints on @xmath8 render the peak widths finite .",
    "physical quantities are contained in each peak as low @xmath16 moments . among those",
    "are the peak volume @xmath17 and the peak energy @xmath18 , i.e. the mean value of @xmath16 .",
    "the bayesian spectral analysis of the lattice data is an interesting problem in itself .",
    "it leads to the discussion of a number of computational strategies in a general context . in order to keep this presentation focused , we refer the reader to a separate paper @xcite where selected aspects of bayesian spectral analysis",
    "are discussed , using the same lattice simulation data as a testing ground .    starting a little more than",
    "a decade ago lattice work on hadronic interaction has followed mostly two tracks ; investigation of heavy - light systems for varying hadron relative distance @xcite , and the computation of scattering phase shifts from energy spectra of two hadrons in a finite box @xcite .",
    "we will not review these subjects here , but rather mention a few leads to facilitate following the literature .",
    "extraction of scattering phase shifts has been successful in terms of structureless particles @xcite . on the other hand , scattering of composite hadrons within lscher s framework",
    "is considerably more difficult .",
    "scattering phase shifts have been obtained for the s - wave interaction of the @xmath19 system in the @xmath20 channel @xcite , and by the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite .",
    "considerable computing power was brought to bear by the jlqcd collaboration to extracting scattering lengths for the @xmath19 , @xmath21n , and nn systems @xcite . while lattice volume limitations hinder a realistic treatment of the nn system , the @xmath21 scattering lengths of ref .",
    "@xcite stand out as the only quantitative results for hadronic interaction from the lattice to date .",
    "systems with heavy , even static , quarks will not yield quantitative results , but are useful to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the phenomenology of nuclear forces .",
    "green and coworkers have been studying energies of static four - quark systems in various geometric configurations , most recently with two static and two light quarks @xcite .",
    "their results shed light on the importance of many - body versus two - body forces in hadrons .",
    "other studies of heavy - light systems @xcite focus on adiabatic potentials , i.e. the ground state energies as functions of the relative hadron - hadron separation . along these lines ,",
    "most of the hadronic interaction work by members of the ukqcd collaboration can be traced from @xcite . there",
    ", heavy - light meson - meson systems are classified according to isospin and spin configurations of the light quarks ( @xmath22 mesons ) .",
    "depending on the channel , interaction potentials at around @xmath23 come out attractive or repulsive , with magnitudes rarely exceeding @xmath24 .",
    "though this is typical for nuclear physics , from the point of view of a lattice simulation these are very small energy differences to be measured .",
    "this is a generic problem for hadronic interaction physics on the lattice .    in the present work we report on a study of a system of two heavy - light mesons based on two operators .",
    "the first one , @xmath25 , is the standard product of two local pseudoscalar heavy - light meson fields at distance @xmath1 .",
    "the other one , @xmath26 , is similar , but nonlocal , probing color rearrangement . in some sense @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 test the importance of quark and gluon exchange degrees of freedom for the interaction .",
    "they enter into a @xmath27 time correlation matrix .",
    "our goal here is to learn about the interaction mechanisms represented by those operators as a function of the relative meson - meson distance .",
    "the current work goes beyond previous studies of heavy - light meson - meson systems mainly in that ( i ) nonlocal operators are considered and ( ii ) operator mixing is built into time correlation functions , allowing the system to ` dynamically pick ' the dominant excitation mechanism as the meson - meson separation @xmath1 varies .",
    "moreover , due to the spectral analysis used in this work we are able to ( iii ) extract the actual excitation strengths of the ground and excited two - meson states .",
    "preliminary results reported in @xcite were based on an analysis of the diagonal correlator elements , with no mixing . there , averaging over annealing start configurations had not been done , the spectral density functions came from single annealing runs . as it turns out this is a source of systematic error that can not be tolerated in the light of the smallness of the extracted energy shifts .",
    "the meson - meson operators employed in this simulation lead to somewhat massive states .",
    "the resulting steep drop of time correlation functions , particularly for the excited states , makes it very difficult to analyze the lattice signal . to deal with this situation we use an anisotropic lattice action .",
    "if the aspect ratio @xmath28 of the lattice constants in space and time directions , respectively , is made larger than one the number of usable time correlation function data is increased before the signal ` vanishes ' into noise .",
