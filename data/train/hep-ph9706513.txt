    "the origin of the observed galactic magnetic fields remains elusive .",
    "the magnetic field of the milky way and the nearby galaxies is of the order of a @xmath0 and is coherent over @xmath1 scales . in the milky way",
    "the magnetic field is orientated along the spiral arms alternating its direction from one arm to the other .",
    "this strongly suggests that the field is supported by a dynamo mechanism which arranges it along the spiral density waves @xcite@xcite .",
    "similar evidence for a dynamo mechanism comes from galaxies at a stage of rapid star formation ( so called star - burst galaxies @xcite ) where the magnetic flux needs to be amplified by a factor of to account for the observations @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , a wide belief that the galactic magnetic fields are generated through a dynamo mechanism @xcite@xcite .",
    "a number of mean field theory dynamo models exist in the literature , the most popular of which is the well known @xmath2 dynamo .",
    "the basic idea of the dynamo mechanism is that a weak seed field could be amplified by the turbulent motion of ionised gas , which follows the differential rotation of the galaxy .",
    "the growth of the field is exponential and , thus , its strength can be increased several orders of magnitude in only a few e - foldings of amplification .",
    "when the field reaches the equipartition energy ( ) then its growth is suppressed by dynamical back - reaction .",
    "if the time scale of growth of the field is no more than a galactic rotation period , then the field amplification factor since the collapse of the protogalaxy is of the order , given that the total number of galactic rotations is .",
    "thus , the seed field required has to be at least on the comoving scale of a protogalaxy ( ) at the time of gravitational collapse .",
    "since the collapse of the galaxies enhances their frozen - in magnetic field by a factor of ( where is the typical mass density of a galaxy and is the current cosmic mass density ) , the above seed field corresponds to a field of the order of over the comoving scale of . assuming that the rms field scales as @xmath3 with the expansion of the universe ( @xmath4 is the scale factor of the universe , in the matter era ) we find that the magnitude of the seed field at the start of structure formation has to be at least , where is the time of equal matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "the origin and nature of this seed field is still an open question .",
    "many authors have argued that it could be produced by stellar winds and other explosions @xcite but such a field would be extremely incoherent over galactic scales .",
    "significant incoherences of the field have been shown @xcite to destabilise and destroy the galactic dynamo and , therefore , it seems that coherency is a crucial factor for seeding the galactic magnetic fields . also , the existing evidence for intergalactic fields @xcite@xcite led people to believe that the origin of galactic seed fields may be truly primordial .    most of the attempts to create a primordial magnetic field in the early universe involve either inflation or phase transitions because the creation of a primordial field can occur only in out of thermal equilibrium conditions @xcite .    at phase transitions",
    "primordial magnetic fields can be created on the surface of the bubble walls if the transition is a first order one @xcite , or due to stochastic higgs  field gradients @xcite .",
    "unfortunately though , phase transitions occur very early and the causal horizon is of much smaller comoving scale than the protogalactic one ( e.g. for the electroweak transition the comoving scale of the horizon is ) .",
    "thus , the generated magnetic field is too incoherent to successfully trigger the galactic dynamo .    due to this",
    "fact , inflation has been considered as another option that could increase the coherency of the created magnetic field @xcite . however , the conformal invariance of electromagnetism suggested that the field would scale as @xmath3 during the inflationary period which , as a result , diminished the field strength to much lower values than the required seed field limit . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "additional terms have been introduced in the lagrangian to break explicitly conformal invariance .",
    "even so , most attempts produced too weak seed fields .",
    "other attempts to generate an adequate seed field involve string theory cosmology @xcite . the problem has been pushed even further back in time , into a possible pre - big bang epoch of negative time , where dilaton inflation can take place .",
    "these models , although attractive , suffer from lack of understanding of the interface between the dilaton inflation era and the usual , post - big bang radiation era .    perhaps the most realistic approach to the problem has been the cosmic string scenario , where the magnetic field is generated by vortical motions inside the wakes of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "vortical generation of a magnetic field has been an early idea of harrison @xcite , who considered the field to be created during the radiation era inside expanding spinning volumes of plasma ( eddies ) .",
    "however , rees has shown that harrison s eddies would be unstable and decay with cosmic expansion , whereas irrotational density perturbations ( lumps ) from curvature fluctuations would grow and dominate @xcite .",
    "rees suggested a different version of vortical magnetic field growth which is similar to harrison s idea but can be applied to a gravitationally bound spinning body .    in the cosmic string scenario vorticity",
    "is generated in the wakes of cosmic strings after structure formation begins .",
    "therefore , the vortical eddies are gravitationally bound and do not suffer from instabilities .",
    "matter in the trail of a string is substantially ionised and so the harrison ",
    "rees mechanism can still operate .",
    "the scale of coherency of the generated magnetic field is set by the scale of wiggles on the string and , for wakes created at @xmath5 it can be up to @xmath6 .",
    "the field strength is of the order of .",
    "thus , cosmic strings are able to generate magnetic fields of enough strength and coherency to seed the galactic dynamo mechanism .",
    "it is not very clear , though , whether stable vortical motions can be generated by the rapid , stochastic , motion of the string wiggles .",
    "an alternative mechanism by avelino and shellard @xcite has overcome this problem by considering dynamical friction . in this model ,",
    "vorticity is generated not by the wiggles but by the strings themselves , which drag matter behind them and introduce circular motions over inter - string scales .",
    "the magnetic field obtained though , is weak and can only marginally seed the galactic dynamo .",
    "also its coherency is very high @xmath7 , which may be incompatible with intergalactic field observations .    in this paper",
    "we employ the mechanism of avelino and shellard in the context of superconducting strings .",
    "it is an increasing belief that cosmic strings may be generically superconducting and carry substantial currents @xcite .",
    "charged current  carrying string networks may evolve in a much different way that the usual , non - superconducting case . as shown by dimopoulos and davis @xcite , superconducting networks may be more tangled with slower moving strings . in this case",
    "we show that the magnetic field generated can be much stronger than in the non - superconducting case and still be coherent over protogalactic scales @xmath8 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a detailed overview of the field theory of string superconductivity in both the bosonic and fermionic case .",
    "in section 3 we deal with the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the superconducting string , which we use to describe the string spacetime and its consequences on particle deflection in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we calculate the primordial magnetic field generated .",
    "first we find the momentum transfer from the string to the plasma and the resulting rotational velocity of the plasma vortical motions .",
    "then , we estimate the generated primordial magnetic field at the time when structure formation begins , taking also into account constraints coming from the observations of the microwave background anisotropy . finally , in section 6 we dicuss our results and give our conclusions . throughout this paper , unless stated otherwise , we use natural units ( ) for which the planck mass is .",
    "string superconductivity was initially conceived by witten @xcite .",
    "there are two types of models that give rise to superconducting strings depending on whether the current carriers are bosons or fermions",
    ". however , through a specific formalism , there is exact correspondence between the two cases in most aspects . in what follows",
    ", we give a description of bosonic and fermionic superconductivity and develop the general formalism to treat them both .",
    "we will describe bosonic superconducting strings in the context of a theory as in @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this theory involves two scalar fields : the @xmath9 higgs  field @xmath10 , which is responsible for the formation of the vortex and the @xmath11 field @xmath12 which breaks electromagnetism inside the string and turns it superconducting .",
    "the lagrangian density of the theory is ,    @xmath13    where and , and also and with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the gauge fields coupled to the vortex and the photon field respectively ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the relevant gauge couplings ) .",
    "the potential @xmath18 is given by ,    @xmath19    where are coupling constants and @xmath20 is the energy scale of the string .    through the above potential it is possible to form a string by breaking @xmath9 . for suitable values of parameters",
    "the coupling between the scalar fields may force the breaking of electromagnetism inside the string , making it superconducting .",
    "one can rewrite the above potential as ,    @xmath21    where is the expectation value of @xmath12 inside the string core .    from the above",
    "it follows that , in order for @xmath9 to be broken and to form the string we require , which gives the constraint ,    @xmath22    furthermore , in order for electromagnetism not to be also broken outside the string we require that the unbroken state is a global minimum of @xmath23 , i.e. that which suggests that ,    @xmath24    in order for electromagnetism to be broken inside the string we require that the minimum of the potential in the core corresponds to a non - zero value of @xmath12 , i.e. which gives ,    @xmath25    finally , in order for the @xmath12-condensate to be contained inside the string we require ,    @xmath26    where is the mass of the higgs particle .",
    "the mass of the @xmath12 particle is easily found as ,    @xmath27    where we have also used ( [ b ] ) .    by combining ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] )",
    "we obtain ,    @xmath28    under the above conditions the theory admits a vortex solution with electromagnetism broken in its core .",
    "the @xmath12 field may be parametrised as ,    @xmath29    where we have assumed that the vortex core lies on the @xmath30-axis .",
    "the phase field @xmath31 may vary randomly along the string and wind up in a non - trivial way . this winding gives rise to the string current .",
    "if one defines the current as , it is straightforward to show that the string current is , .",
    "integrating over the string core gives ,    @xmath32    where the constant @xmath33 is given by ,    @xmath34    varying ( [ lbos ] ) with respect to @xmath10,@xmath12,@xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath31 respectively , gives the following equations ,    @xmath35    where .",
    "the last equation of the above expresses the dynamical conservation of the string current .      following witten",
    "@xcite we introduce two fermion fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 which couple to the vortex field @xmath10 through a coupling @xmath38 .",
    "then , the lagrangian density may be written as @xcite ,    @xmath39    where and with @xmath40 being the dirac matrices and @xmath41 the gauge coupling .",
    "as shown in @xcite fermionic superconductivity resembles strongly the bosonic one apart from some minor aspects such as particle production .",
    "there is indeed a way to switch from one picture to the other .",
    "let us introduce the scalar field @xmath42 such that ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the 2-dimensional levi - civita tensor .    then ,",
    "with the equivalence , the string current is ,    @xmath45    if we define @xmath42 such that ,    @xmath46    then the current in ( [ jy ] ) is identified with the one given in ( [ j ] ) . as shown in @xcite",
    "the above definition of @xmath42 is consistent . in terms of this formalism",
    "we can describe both the fermionic and the bosonic superconducting strings .",
    "non - superconducting cosmic strings are described by the well  known goto ",
    "nambu action @xcite ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the energy per unit length of the string , @xmath49 are the string world - sheet coordinates and @xmath50 is the determinant of the world - sheet metric .",
    "the relation between the spacetime and the world - sheet coordinates may be expressed as ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 are vectors perpendicular to the string , that form a basis for the 2-dimensional perpendicular space spanned by the @xmath53 coordinates for which , .",
    "e.t.c . indeces to denote the components on the 2-dimensional world - sheet of the string , whereas @xmath54 e.t.c .",
    "indeces will be used to denote the components in 4-dimensions .",
    "the projection of a vector @xmath55 on the string world - sheet is where @xmath56 are the 4-dimensional space coordinates . in a similar way we can project higher rank tensors .",
    "finally , the @xmath57 e.t.c .",
    "indeces will be used for the 2-dimensional space perpendicular to the string . ]",
    "the relation between the string metric @xmath58 and the spacetime metric @xmath59 to first order is @xcite ,    @xmath60    in the case of superconducting string the action has to account for the existence of a current . in the bosonic picture",
    "this , in fact , is equivalent with considering the addition of the @xmath12 field kinetic  energy term , field is included into @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath61    where and we have used ( [ sigma ] ) , ( [ k ] ) and ( [ y ] ) .",
    "thus , with the addition of the current term the goto  nambu action becomes @xcite ,    @xmath62=-\\int d^{2}\\xi\\sqrt{-\\gamma}\\,(\\mu-\\frac{j^{2}}{4ke^{2 } } ) \\label{ds}\\ ] ]    where we have also used ( [ jy ] ) .    including the usual maxwell terms ,",

    "also , from ( [ y ] ) one can easily show that ,    @xmath67    using the above and ( [ j ] ) one can obtain the current conservation equation ( [ jcons ] ) . employing the coulomb gauge",
    "we obtain , , i.e. _ the gradient of the phase field @xmath31 remains constant along the string _",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , from ( [ jy ] ) and ( [ boxy ] ) we obtain , . taking the time component of this , we find ,    @xmath68    where is the electric field , externally applied on the string .",
    "the above justifies the fact that the strings are considered to be superconducting .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , ( [ je ] ) breaks down when the current grows very large .",
    "indeed , there is a maximum current over which the string loses its superconducting properties .",
    "this occurs when the energy of the current either permits unwindings of the phase field ( bosonic case ) or allows current carriers to escape from the string ( fermionic case ) . in both cases",
    "the maximum current can not exceed , @xcite .",
    "the self - inductance of the string may be defined as follows @xcite ,    @xmath69    where is the string width and @xmath70 is a suitable cut - off radius usually taken as the curvature radius of the string or the inter - string distance of the string network . in the above .",
    "considering self - inductance effects ( [ je ] ) is modified as @xcite ,    @xmath71    where the renormalised charge is ,    @xmath72    considering back - reaction effects the photon field may be expressed as @xcite@xcite ,    @xmath73\\,\\delta([x - x(\\xi)]^{2})\\ ] ]    where the step function @xmath74 signifies the initiation of the current .",
    "after some algebra the above reduces to @xcite@xcite@xcite ,    @xmath75    using the above , ( [ jy ] ) and ( [ boxy ] ) we obtain @xcite ,    @xmath76    which is the renormalised version of ( [ boxy ] ) . in the above and @xmath77",
    "is the external field strength .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ ytild ] ) is the lorentz force on the string since , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the external electric and magnetic fields respectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the string current we have @xcite  @xcite , @xmath80    from the above , since the quantity @xmath81 is unaltered by renormalisation , we conclude that _ the string current is unaffected by charge renormalisation_. also , ( [ ytild ] ) suggests that , in the absence of external fields @xcite .",
    "using the renormalised version of ( [ jy ] ) we can immediately obtain current conservation .",
    "equivalently , using ( [ j ] ) and ( [ al ] ) one can show that ,    @xmath82    which again suggests that the current is conserved since .    finally , we can obtain the renormalised version of the action by considering the inductance energy of the string @xcite , .",
    "thus , the addition to the goto  nambu action due to the string current is ,    @xmath83    adding the above to ( [ sns ] ) and using also ( [ etild ] ) we find ,    @xmath84    which is the renormalised analogue of ( [ ds ] ) .    in a similar way we can regard the total action in ( [ sj ] ) and ( [ sy ] ) by considering the external fields and the renormalised values of the physical quantities . from now on , unless stated otherwise , we will refer to the renormalised values of the latter . for economy , we will drop the tildes and hats .",

    "now , the maxwell s equations give ,    @xmath87    using the above we can find the electric and magnetic field around the string ,    @xmath88    the last of the above is the well - known biot ",
    "savart law for a line current .",

    "the addition of this term suggests that the core solution ( [ t1 ] ) for the string energy  momentum tensor becomes @xcite@xcite ,    @xmath106    the above is a core solution that takes into account electromagnetic back - reaction .",

    "as mentioned , though , the string tension may be larger than suggested by ( [ tt ] ) . in that case @xmath132 in the expression ( [ f ] ) would decrease and the gravitational pull of the string will be weakened since it depends on the difference as shown in ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "however , ( [ ff ] ) suggests that , even in the extreme case , when , the attractive force is decreased only by a factor of 2 .",
    "writing the metric ( [ dst ] ) in cartesian coordinates we have ,    @xmath133    where the and we have assumed that the string lies on the @xmath30-axis . note that we need to extract from the above a wedge of angle width @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "then ,    @xmath134    where the dots signify derivation with respect to time .    using and",
    ", we insert the above to the geodesic equation ( [ geo ] ) and obtain @xcite ,    @xmath135    where .",
    "the above gives the acceleration felt by the particles due to the gravitational pull of the string field , in the frame of the string .",
    "suppose that the string moves in the @xmath136-direction with constant velocity .",
    "then for a particle in the position we have initially , and .",
    "the velocity boost felt by the particle towards the @xmath42-direction after its encounter with the string is @xcite ,    @xmath137    where is the lorentz factor and we have also used ( [ acl ] ) .",
    "using ( [ h00 ] ) and ( [ app ] ) the above gives ,    @xmath138    taking into account the deficit angle , the relative boost between two particles on the opposite sides of the string is , .",
    "switching to the particle frame gives ,    @xmath139    where we have also used ( [ d ] ) .",
    "avelino and shellard @xcite have realised that the deflection of particles in the string spacetime results into a net drag of the plasma behind the string .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnitude of the particle velocity is unaltered after its interaction with the string .",
    "the back - reaction of this effect is a decelerating force on the string .",
    "the velocity of plasma dragging may be estimated by taylor expansion of the particle velocity . in the lowest order in @xmath115",
    "we find ,    @xmath140- 8\\pi^{2}g^{2}(qj)^{4}v\\gamma^{2}(1+\\frac{1}{v^{2}\\gamma^{2 } } ) \\label{vx}\\ ] ]    the momentum change of the string is , , where is the energy density of the universe with .",
    "thus , the drag force per unit length on the string is ,    @xmath141    where is the inter - string distance of the network @xcite .    inserting ( [ vx ] ) into the above we find ,    @xmath142    where is the hubble radius .",
    "the above force should be compared with the plasma friction force on the strings , , @xcite where @xmath143 is the particle mass .",
    "it is easy to show that throughout the range of @xmath144 the above drag force is always subdominant and , thus , it does not affect the network evolution .",
    "has no effect during the friction era of the network . during horizon",
    "scaling we can compare @xmath145 with the string tension @xmath146 and verify that the latter dominates at all times . ]",
    "although the motion of the strings is not significantly affected by the dragging of the plasma , the latter may gain substantial momentum during this process .",
    "such momentum may introduce turbulence which could generate a primordial magnetic field .      in the one scale model the scale of the string network inter - string distance",
    "is comparable to the string curvature radius , .",
    "a string segment of length @xmath147 may transfer momentum to the plasma contained in an inter - string volume @xmath148 . in that way the network may introduce vortical motions to the plasma on inter - string scales .",
    "an estimate of the plasma rotational velocity @xmath149 may be obtained as follows ,    @xmath150    where is the mass of an inter - string volume and @xmath151 is the total force on the plasma by a string segment of length @xmath70 . from the above the rotational velocity",
    "is estimated as ,    @xmath152    the total force may be obtained from ( [ fx ] ) as follows ,    @xmath153\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite , for currents greater than a critical value @xmath154 the network can never exit the friction domination era of its evolution . in @xcite @xmath154",
    "is estimated as ,    @xmath155    however , even for such strong currents the network does reach a scaling solution during which the strings move with a terminal velocity given by @xcite ,    @xmath156    as implied in @xcite the string current is influential on the behaviour of the network only if .",
    "thus , we will consider this case only . using ( [ vt ] ) the total force ( [ ff ] ) becomes ,    @xmath157\\ ] ]    in the above the 2nd , the 4th and the 5th terms of the right hand side may be disregarded by means of the condition . by comparing the remaining terms with each other",
    "it can be shown that the last term remains also always subdominant .",
    "therefore , the above can be written as ,    @xmath158 \\label{ff}\\ ] ]    considering the overall range of @xmath144 we can rewrite the above as ,    @xmath159    where the critical current @xmath160 is ,    @xmath161    for currents stronger that the above value the current dependent term in ( [ boost ] ) becomes dominant , i.e. the gravitational pull of the string is actually felt by the particles .    inserting ( [ f3 ] ) into ( [ vrot ] ) and using also ( [ vt ] )",
    "we find ,    @xmath162      harrison @xcite suggested first that turbulence in an expanding universe may generate a magnetic field since the turbulent velocity of the plasma would be different for the ions and the electrons .",
    "consider a rotating volume @xmath23 of plasma .",
    "suppose that the angular velocities @xmath163 and @xmath164 of the ion and the electron fluid respectively are uniform inside @xmath23 .",
    "then , since , we find that ,    @xmath165    where is the ion density , which scales as pressureless matter , and is the electron density , which scales as radiation due to the strong coupling between the electrons and the photons through thompson scattering . the angular momentum of each plasma component has to be conserved .",
    "this suggests that ,    @xmath166    thus , the ion fluid spins down faster than the electron - photon gas .",
    "consequently , a current is generated which creates a magnetic field in the volume @xmath23 .",
    "rees , however , has shown that expanding volumes of spinning plasma are unstable and decay with cosmic expansion compared to irrotational density perturbations @xcite .",
    "he suggested instead a different version of vortical magnetic field generation involving the scattering of the electrons on the microwave background radiation .",
    "this would tend to damp the vortical motions of the electrons in contrast to the ions which would stay unaffected .",
    "the result is again the generation of currents but , this time , it is the electron fluid that slows down .",
    "the mechanism applies to gravitationally bound spinning bodies such as those formed when structure formation begins .    in both cases ,",
    "the maxwell s equations suggest @xcite ,    @xmath167    where is the nucleon mass and * w * is the vorticity given by ,    @xmath168    from the above the magnetic field generated over inter - string distances is ,    @xmath169    the turbulence inside the wake of cosmic strings is expected to ionise the plasma even after decoupling @xcite .",
    "also for superconducting cosmic strings the existence of a magnetocylinder around the core @xcite is expected to induce further charge separation due to the difference of the inertia of the scattered particles . since , from ( [ bv ] ) it is evident that the stronger field will be generated at early times .",
    "thus , we will calculate the magnetic field generated at , the time of equal matter and radiation densities , since this is the earliest that large scale streaming of the plasma is possible . from ( [ vrot1 ] ) and ( [ b ] )",
    "we obtain ,    @xmath170    for the above gives ,    @xmath171    which is coherent over comoving scales ,    @xmath172    where is the present time .    for energy scales corresponding to a grand unified theory ( gut ) phase transition , and",
    "the above suggest that with a coherency of the order of which is quite sufficient to seed the galactic magnetic fields",
    ". however , as we discuss below , this estimate may be over - optimistic .",
    "the deficit angle of the string spacetime apart from deflecting the trajectories of particles affects light propagation as well @xcite . from ( [ dst ] ) by setting we see that photons are boosted by the deficit angle even though the prefactor is irrelevant . as a result a string moving in front of radiation will blueshift light due to the doppler effect . thus ,",
    "a string network is expected to generate temperature anisotropies on the microwave background radiation .",
    "these can not exceed the observed values ,    @xmath173    the anisotropy generated by a single string is @xcite ,    @xmath174    the rms anisotropy due to a network of cosmic strings is estimated as @xcite@xcite ,    @xmath175    from the above and ( [ d ] ) we find that for superconducting cosmic strings ,    @xmath176 \\label{trms}\\ ] ]    thus , for even the maximum current could not challenge the observations . however , for gut strings one can not allow the current to reach its maximum value .",
    "indeed , there is some doubt whether superconducting strings may attain the maximum current @xcite since the energy density of the current should not exceed the string linear mass density @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the current term in ( [ trms ] ) should always remain subdominant .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath177    by evaluating the ( [ beq ] ) with we obtain the maximum permissible magnetic field for gut energy scales ,    @xmath178    with coherence length ,    @xmath179    the above field is of sufficient strength and coherency to seed the galactic dynamo process and generate the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "we have showen that gut superconducting cosmic strings are able to generate turbulence on inter - string scales , which gives rise to a primordial magnetic field of enough strength to seed the dynamo process in galaxies and account for the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the generated field is coherent over very large scales , comparable with the protogalactic ones before gravitational collapse commenced .",
    "turbulence and coherent rotation on these scales may also be related to the fragmentation process of galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a primordial field , coherent over an entire protogalaxy , may have played a crucial role in removing angular momentum in a similar way as in the case of the collapse of protostellar clouds @xcite@xcite .",
    "due to excessive microwave temperature anisotropies , a maximum string current may not be acceptable .",
    "however , even under this constraint , the magnetic field generated is still adequate to seed the galactic dynamo .",
    "a possibly stronger constraint may be implemented by considering the density inhomogeneities due to the string wakes , since their growth is enhanced not only due to the deficit angle but also , due to the gravitational pull of the strings @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the overdensities is strongly dependent on the dark matter model used .",
    "indeed , string wake overdensities may be substantially suppressed in the case of hot dark matter , due to free streaming @xcite .    in our estimates of the generated magnetic field",
    "we have used the extreme values ( [ u ] ) and ( [ tt ] ) for the string linear mass density and tension . as we mentioned though",
    ", the string tension may be larger than suggested by ( [ tt ] ) .",
    "this however , would relax the temperature anisotropy constraint and the density inhomogeneity constraint even more .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the string current remains constant during the network evolution .",
    "indeed , the current is dynamically conserved as shown by ( [ jcons ] ) .",
    "also , in the bosonic case ( [ jpsi ] ) suggests that current conservation is ensured on topological grounds . however , most of the field theory of section 2 , concerns a straight and infinite superconducting string",
    ". a realistic string may be much more complicated .",
    "still , it can be shown @xcite that even in this case the string current remains constant when the network reaches a scaling solution .",
    "our treatment is similar to this of avelino and shellard @xcite . in their work , however , they consider the case of wiggly strings , which also have an attractive gravitational field due to the difference between their renormalised linear mass density and tension .",
    "the latter is a result of the tangled shape of wiggly strings , which , in effect , increases the string length ( and thus , the linear mass density ) between two fixed points on the string while also decreasing the tension due to the random orientation of the string microstructure @xcite . for superconducting strings ,",
    "microstructure is suppressed by electromagnetic radiation emission @xcite and the difference between the linear mass density and tension is due to the existence of a current , which increases the energy content of the string while generating pressure and reducing , thus , the string tension @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gravitational field of superconducting strings arises in a qualitatively different way that the one of wiggly strings . moreover , there are also quantative differences between the two cases , since , for strong enough currents , a superconducting string network reaches a different scaling solution , due to excessive plasma friction @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the inter - string distance is much smaller than the horizon and the strings are slow moving .",
    "the above enable superconducting strings to generate much stronger magnetic fields than wiggly strings .",
    "in fact , since the string microstructure is suppressed by the existence of a current , wiggly strings may be regarded as the limit of superconducting strings when the current is very small .",
    "the superconducting string model provides a realistic mechanism for primordial magnetic field generation .",
    "the field generated by natural ( gut - scale ) values of the parameters is coherent over protogalactic scale and strong enough to seed the dynamo process in galaxies .",
    "thus , our mechanism may be considered as a prime candidate to explain the observed galactic magnetic fields .",
