    "nonequilibrium steady states , which are characterised by a lack of detailed balance , have the important property that they can exhibit phase transitions even in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the condensation transition @xcite is an important example of such a transition in which particles are distributed homogeneously over the system at low densities , but above a critical density , a macroscopic number of particles form a cluster .",
    "this transition has been studied using several different models including aggregation - diffusion models and zero range processes ( zrp ) for homogeneous systems @xcite and for systems with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "the zrp , in which a particle hops to a neighbouring site with a rate that depends only on the properties of the departure site , has the attractive feature that its steady state distribution can be found exactly @xcite .",
    "this model has been generalised in various directions in recent years @xcite , and has been used to model clustering phenomena in traffic flow @xcite , granular gases @xcite and networks @xcite , avalanche dynamics in sandpiles @xcite , slow dynamics in glasses @xcite , and to understand phase separation in nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the jamming transition is an avatar of the condensation transition , and has been studied in an exclusion process ( ep ) in which a hard core particle hops to an empty nearest neighbour with a rate that depends on the vacant sites in front of it . an exclusion process with hole - dependent rate mimics traffic flow on a highway where a driver increases ( decreases ) its speed if the headway in front of it is large ( small ) @xcite . in such traffic models , the hop rate is an increasing function of the vacancies with appropriate lower and upper bounds on the speed of the car .",
    "however it has been shown that if the hop rates decay sufficiently slowly with the increasing number of vacancies , as the total density of the system is decreased in a closed one - dimensional system , a transition occurs from a laminar phase with typical inter - particle spacing of order unity to a jammed phase in which a macroscopic headway forms in front of a particle @xcite . since the ep with hole - dependent rates can be exactly mapped to a zrp , a lot is known about its steady state properties ; however a basic question regarding the spatial correlation functions in the ep has not been addressed in previous studies . in this article , we are interested in calculating the particle - particle correlation function in the steady state of this model in the canonical ensemble .",
    "analytical formulae for the two - point correlation functions are hard to come by .",
    "for the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) on a ring , which is a special case of the exclusion model studied here , this is trivial because all configurations are equally likely in the steady state .",
    "a nontrivial exact formula for the tasep with open boundaries ( entrance rate @xmath8 and exit rate @xmath9 ) was given in @xcite for arbitrary system size .",
    "although the exact formula was determined in the latter case , their limiting behaviour has not been calculated to the best of our knowledge , especially at the critical phase line @xmath10 .",
    "recently the particle - particle correlation function for the ep with hole - dependent rates was calculated in the laminar phase for certain special choices of hopping rates in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite . here",
    "we study the same model in the canonical ensemble , and find a simple analytical formula for the generating function of the two - point correlation function with arbitrary hop rates in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this result is applied to the hop rate @xmath1 which decays to a nonzero constant with the number of holes @xmath0 in front of the particle . for this choice",
    ", a jamming transition occurs when @xmath11 at a critical density @xmath12 @xcite , and here we calculate the two - point correlation function at the critical point and in the laminar phase .",

    "we then find an exact expression for the generating function of the correlation function in the thermodynamic limit . in sec .",
    "[ specific ] , for @xmath1 , we show that at the critical density , the correlation function decays as a power law with continuously varying exponent .",
    "the behaviour of the correlation function in the laminar phase is also studied .",
    "we finally conclude with a summary of our results and discussion in sec .",
    "we consider an exclusion process defined on a ring with @xmath13 lattice sites and @xmath14 particles in which each site can be occupied by at most one particle .",
    "a particle hops to its right empty neighbour with a rate @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the number of holes in front of the particle .",
    "this ep can be mapped to a one - dimensional zrp with periodic boundary conditions in which a site can support any number of particles and a particle hops to its left neighbour with a rate @xmath15 where @xmath0 now is the number of particles at the departure site @xcite . as a result of this mapping , the density @xmath16 in the ep with @xmath13 sites and @xmath14 particles is related to the density @xmath17 in zrp with @xmath18 sites and @xmath19 particles as @xmath20 .    as we will be exploiting the connection of ep to zrp in the following sections , below we briefly review the steady state properties of the zrp and refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "the zrp has the important property that the single site weights factorise .",
    "more precisely , the distribution of a configuration @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of particles at the @xmath23th site and @xmath24 , is given by p(c)= z_l , n^-1  _",

    "in such a case , the distribution @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",

    "we will work with u(n)=1 +  ,  b > 0 [ hoprate ] where @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath0 is number of vacant sites in front of a particle in the ep picture .",
    "when @xmath39 , we arrive at the tasep on a ring in which a particle hops to the right empty site irrespective of the vacancies in front of it ( see appendix  [ app_b0 ] also ) . for the above choice of hop rates , the weight @xmath40 is given by f(n)= [ fn ] where @xmath41 is the pochhammer symbol or rising factorial . its generating function @xmath28 is writeable as g(z)=_2f_1(1,1;1+b;z ) [ gz ] where the gauss hypergeometric function is defined as @xcite f_1(a , b;c;z ) = _ n=0^   it is easy to see that the radius of convergence of @xmath28 in ( [ gz ] ) is @xmath42",
    ". then equation ( [ fugacity ] ) and the discussion following it shows that a jamming transition occurs at the critical density _ c= [ cp ] for @xmath2 .",
    "although we will focus on the rate ( [ hoprate ] ) which models ` attractive interactions ' between particles in the zrp , we also consider the case of free particles in appendix  [ app_free ] for which @xmath43 @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "each particle is endowed with an exponential clock that ticks at rate one , but since the particles are free and act independently , the total hopout rate is equal to the number of particles at the site .",
    "consider a system of @xmath14 particles on @xmath13 sites .",
    "if @xmath44 is a configuration in this system , let @xmath45 denote the stationary weight of such a configuration .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the partition function of the ep in this system .",
    "that is to say , @xmath47 we will first give two different recurrence relations for @xmath46 .",
    "note that any configuration can be written in the form @xmath48 where @xmath44 is a configuration in the system with @xmath49 sites and @xmath50 particles .",
    "since we want this representation to be unique , @xmath51 has to be 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath52 where we set @xmath53 in the last line and the factor of @xmath54 counts for the number of ways one can split @xmath55 in this way .",
    "the sum over @xmath44 now gives the partition function for a system with @xmath56 sites and @xmath50 particles where the first site is occupied .",
    "since the system is translation - invariant , this gives the formula , z_l , n= _ k=0^l - n f(k ) ( k+1 ) z_l - k-1,n-1 .",

    "l , n= _ k=0^n",
    "f(k ) z_l-1,n - k [ pfnreczrp ] with @xmath58 since @xmath59 .",
    "since a zrp can be mapped to ep by regarding the @xmath14 particles in ep as @xmath57 sites in zrp and @xmath60 holes in ep as @xmath0 particles in zrp , the two partition functions can be related as z_l , n=   z_n , l - n [ map ] the prefactor on the right hand site ( rhs ) of the above equation arises due to the fact that the mapping described above between zrp and ep assumes that an ep configuration begins with an occupied site .",
    "the ep configurations that begin with an empty site are taken care of by the factor @xmath61 using the argument described above .    therefore , on using the last two equations , we get [ pfnrec2 ] z_l , n= _ k=0^l - n f(k ) z_l - k-1,n-1 .",
    "we have thus shown that both recurrence relations and with the initial conditions @xmath62 give rise to the same formula .",
    "although we have proved this result , we have no deeper understanding of this equivalence .",
    "it turns out that one can express @xmath46 exactly using integer partitions . to state the result , we need some definitions .",
    "an integer partition of a positive integer @xmath0 is a representation of @xmath0 in terms of other positive integers which sum up to @xmath0 . for convenience ,",
    "the parts are written in weakly decreasing order .",
    "for example @xmath63 is a partition of 14 .",
    "if @xmath64 is a partition of @xmath0 , we denote this as @xmath65 .",
    "another way of expressing a partition is in the so - called frequency representation , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 represents the multiplicity of @xmath23 in the partition .",
    "this information can be encoded as a vector @xmath68 .",
    "for example , the same partition of 14 above can be written as @xmath69 followed by an infinite string of zeros , which we omit .",
    "we will write @xmath70 to mean a partition of @xmath0 in this notation .",
    "the number of parts of a partition , denoted by @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72 . given a function @xmath73 defined on the positive integers , we will denote @xmath74 in the same vein , let @xmath75 . finally , recall that the pochhammer symbol or rising factorial @xmath76 for nonnegative integer @xmath0 , is given by the product @xmath77 if @xmath0 is positive and by @xmath78 if @xmath79 .",
    "the partition function of the ep can be written as [ pfexact ] z_n+m , n = ( n+m ) _ |a",
    "m f(|a ) , where the length of the system is @xmath80 and @xmath76 is the pochhammer symbol defined after . we will prove this by equating both representations and .",

    "we will now prove the formula for @xmath87 equivalent to by induction on @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath89 , there is a single term in the sum corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath91 .",
    "this is correct since there is a single vacancy and a factor of @xmath92 for the particle preceding it .",
    "now , we assume that is true for the number of vacancies being any of @xmath93 . using and the induction assumption ,",
    "we can write @xmath94 notice that each term in the above equation contains the factor @xmath95 where @xmath96 . we can thus replace @xmath97 in the sum by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath95 can be replaced by @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the sum above can be reinterpreted as a sum over partitions of @xmath88 .",
    "we have to compute the coefficient of @xmath100 in such a term .",

    "then the contribution to the correlation function @xmath111 comes from only those configurations in which both the @xmath23th and @xmath112th site are occupied . using the mapping between ep and zrp described in sec .",

    "is conserved , the maximum number of particles in the first cluster can be @xmath50 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath113 which gives @xmath114 , as the lower limit @xmath115 can not be below zero .",
    "also the local conservation in the first cluster with @xmath109 sites requires that @xmath116 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath117 since @xmath118 can not exceed the total number of holes in the system .",
    "it is evident from ( [ corrsim ] ) that the partition function at all densities is required to evaluate the correlation function .",
    "however , barring some special cases that are discussed in appendix  [ app_b0 ] and  [ app_free ] , it does not seem possible to calculate the exact partition function @xmath26 for all densities . in the following subsections , we will calculate the two - point correlation function in the thermodynamic limit as the problem is analytically tractable in this limit . for @xmath119 and finite @xmath109",
    ", we first note that the limits in the sum appearing in ( [ corrsim ] ) simplify to @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "k=0^r z_r , k  e^-k ( + p ) thus the correlation function is related to the _ grand canonical _ partition function of the ep with @xmath109 sites , which is not known .",
    "however as explained in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the grand canonical partition function for zrp is known .",
    "we therefore define the generating function of the correlation function as @xmath127 which , on using ( [ genfncorr1 ] ) , works out to be g(y ) & = & _ l=0^(y e^-p)^l   _ n=0^_l , n ( y e^)^n - + & = & - [ genfncorr2 ] where @xmath128 .",

    ", we find that the scaling function @xmath191 which thus reproduces the result at the critical point obtained in the last subsection . at large @xmath187 , as the scaling function @xmath192 , the correlation function decays exponentially fast with inter - particle distance @xmath109 .",
    "this analysis yields the correlation length defined by @xmath193 to be ~(1-z)^-1 ~(-_c)^- [ xidefn ] which , by virtue , of ( [ bg2 ] ) gives @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "in this article , we studied an exclusion process on a ring in which a particle hops to a right empty neighbour with a rate that depends on the number of empty sites in front of it .",
    "although we assumed that the hops are totally asymmetric , the results obtained here hold for the general case also in which a particle may hop to either left or right empty neighbour with nonzero rate .",
    "this is because the general exclusion model maps to a zrp whose partition function is independent of the bias in the hop rates @xcite .",
    "then our exact equation ( [ corrsim ] ) for the correlation function , which holds for any bias in the hop rates , gives the same solution as obtained in the previous sections .",
    "although most of the results for the zrp and hence the exclusion process have been obtained in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite , some studies in the canonical ensemble have also been carried out @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an expression for the partition function @xmath123 in the canonical ensemble at and in the vicinity of the critical point has been calculated for finite systems @xcite , and it has been shown that for the weight @xmath25 with the same asymptotic behavior as ( [ gz ] ) , @xmath26 depends exponentially on system size for @xmath194 , but sublinearly on @xmath57 for @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the free energy ( [ zrpenergy ] ) changes with the density @xmath17 in the homogeneous phase but becomes a constant equal to @xmath195 ( which is chosen to be zero in @xcite ) for all @xmath196 , as seen here in fig .",
    "[ fig_freeenergy ] . due to the latter property",
    ", our analysis can not be carried over to the jammed phase .",
    "however since we are mainly concerned with critical exponents here , it suffices to consider the system in the infinite size limit .    for an infinitely large system",
    ", we have derived an exact expression ( [ gmain ] ) for the generating function of the steady state two - point correlation function in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this result was applied to the hop rate ( [ hoprate ] ) for @xmath197 to find the relevant critical exponents .",
    "interestingly , we find that at the critical point , the exponent characterising the power law decay of the two - point correlation function changes continuously with the parameter @xmath38 in the hop rate ( [ hoprate ] ) .",
    "equilibrium systems in two dimensions that show continuously varying exponents at the critical point are known @xcite , and their behavior is understood in terms of conformal field theories with central charge one @xcite .",
    "we do not know if the behavior found here has any such deeper significance .",
    "the correlation length exponent @xmath198 in ( [ xidefn ] ) also changes continuously for @xmath177 , whereas it is constant for @xmath7 .",
    "this scaling for the correlation length has been obtained in a previous work @xcite as well .",
    "in addition , we have also derived the scaling function for the correlation function in the high density phase here .",
    "the case of @xmath144 , where the system is in laminar phase for all densities , has been considered in @xcite , but an explicit expression for the correlation function was not provided .    from the numerical data shown in figs .",
    "[ corr2pt5 ] and [ corr3pt3 ] at the critical point , we note that the finite size effects set in early on .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ corr2pt5 ] for @xmath199 and a system size @xmath200 , a power law is seen for about a decade only .",
    "this makes a numerical determination of the correlation function exponent difficult .",
    "here we have given an expression ( [ gmain ] ) for the generating function of the two - point correlation function for an infinite system which can easily generate several decades of data .",
    "for a finite system with @xmath13 sites , we expect the correlation function to be of the following scaling form : c(r , l)=  f ( r l^-z ) [ finitel ] where the scaling function @xmath201 is a constant for @xmath202 and decays for @xmath203 . in the zrp , the average mass cluster at the critical point scales as @xmath204 and @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that at the critical density , there is a single length scale in the system under consideration and is set by the typical headway , we expect @xmath206 for @xmath5 .",
    "this expectation is consistent with the data shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ corr2pt5 ] for @xmath199 where we see that the data collapse gets better with increasing @xmath13 .",

    "for @xmath207 , as all configurations are equally likely @xcite , the steady state partition function is given by @xmath208 .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath209 vanishes in the limit @xmath119 .",
    "it can be easily checked that ( [ corrsim ] ) also gives this result .",
    "for large systems , the free energy defined in ( [ zrpenergy ] ) works out to be ( ) = ( 1 + ) ( 1+)-which is an increasing function of the density @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath210 , we have @xmath211 and therefore g(y)=- which immediately yields @xmath212 , as expected in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when the particles jump independently ( in the zrp picture ) , the hop out rate is proportional to the number of particles at the site , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore from ( [ product ] ) , the zrp partition function is easily seen to be @xmath213 using this in ( [ corrsim ] ) , we obtain the exact expression for the two - point correlation function as n_i n_i+r = _ k = k_min^k_max ( n - r+k)^l - n - k   in the thermodynamic limit , the above expression gives n_i n_i+r = _",
