    "the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) ( fanson et al . 1998 ) is the fourth and final element in nasa s family of `` great observatories '' .",
    "sirtf consists of a 0.85-meter telescope , cooled to @xmath0 and three cryogenically - cooled science instruments capable of performing imaging and spectroscopy in the @xmath1 m wavelength range ( fig .",
    "[ lamres ] ) .",
    "more details are summarized in table  [ sirtffacts ] .",
    ".[sirtffacts]summary of important sirtf parameters [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "during the past two years , ground - based surveys have begun to succeed in identifying large numbers of relatively young , nearby brown dwarfs in star - forming regions , young open clusters and the eld .",
    "irac will be able to extend those e orts to older and lower mass brown dwarfs and superplanets .",
    "in nearby star - forming regions like taurus , irac should be able to detect isolated objects down to near the mass of jupiter , @xmath2 . in the nearest and best - studied open clusters  in particular , the pleiades and the hyades ",
    "irac should be able to detect brown dwarfs down to @xmath3 .",
    "as figure  [ bdiracbands ] illustrates , the ratio of the irac bands at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m is a very good means of selecting brown dwarfs .",
    "the method of observation would be to carry out a large area survey of several open star clusters ( e.g. ngc  2264 , pleiades , hyades ) .",
    "the survey area is approximately 5 square degrees for ngc  2264 and the pleiades , and approximately 10 square degrees for the hyades .",
    "the integration time would be 30 seconds per position , observing each position three times ( 90s total ) , which would achieve a sensitivity of 10@xmath4jy , 5@xmath5 at 4.5@xmath4 m .",
    "the total observing time for all three fields would be about 160 hours . the brown dwarf candidates would be selected by 3.6/4.5@xmath4 m color , based on model predictions and known objects from the 2mass and denis surveys .",
    "the lowest mass objects will be detected only at 4.5@xmath4 m in 90s .",
    "the 4.5@xmath4 m only objects would need to be re - observed with much longer integrations to provide a detection at 3.6@xmath4 m .",
    "figure [ bdiractracks ] shows the irac color / color diagram for objects with masses of 5 , 10 , 20 , and @xmath6 at various ages .",
    "the irac color / color diagram for galaxies in the field is shown in the same diagram .",
    "the galaxies are well - separated from the brown dwarfs , appearing in the lower left corner of the color / color plot .",
    "( fazio et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral range covered by the irs includes most of the important emission and absorption features from interstellar and solar - system - like dust grains ( fig .",
    "[ hd100546 ] ) .",
    "it also includes many fine structure lines of ions and neutral atoms that are bright in hii regions , phot - dissociation regions and young stellar objects ; the lower transitions in pure rotational spectrum of molecular hydrogen ; and many other molecular rotational and rotation - vibration lines of abundant species whose emission is important in the energetics or diagnosis of warm molecular gas .",
    "the irs is particularly sensitive to emission from dust and gas that lies in the inner parts of protostellar , protoplanetary and debris disks , between a few tenths and a few tens of au from the star . in the nearest regions of star formation",
    ", the irs will be able  in just a few minutes of integration  to take high - quality spectra of disks around protostellar objects with masses down to the hydrogen - burning limit and even beyond .",
    "[ hd100546 ] also illustrates how the mid - ir seds varies under different boundary conditions and hence can be used as powerful diagnostics for disk evolution and structure , even if the source is spatially unresolved ( armus et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "collisions between galaxies are one of the most energetic events in the universe with energies of typically @xmath7  the equivalent of @xmath8 supernovae  on timescales of about @xmath9 yrs ( struck 1999 ) .",
    "the interactions trigger the formation of massive star clusters either directly through the collision of clouds or induce bars which funnel gas and foster wave and resonant ring star formation .",
    "the strongest star formation rates are usually observed in the most violently interacting galaxies  the best known example probably is the antennae galaxy ngc  4038/39 .",
    "the young stars within a starburst are extremely enshrouded by dust with typical average extinctions of @xmath10mag ( smith et al .",
    "hence , observational studies in the mid - ir are the best method to probe the properties of dusty starburst cores and the surrounding interstellar medium . fig .",
    "[ irsiags1 ] illustrates the spatial resolution of the irs spectrographs with their slits overlayed on the hst / wfpc2 picture of the antennae galaxy ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) . at the distance of 2.8kpc",
    "the width of the short - high slit ( @xmath11 m ) corresponds to only 500pc ; the length of the short- and long - low slits of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , make it  for the first time  practically possibly to obtain mid - ir spectra of the entire region at relatively high spatial resolution .",
    "figure  [ irsiags2 ] shows a simulation of how the spectrum of a low luminosity region in the antennae galaxy will look when observed with the irs high - resolution module .",
    "the on - source integration time for this simulation is 256s , the flux is normalized to an average 20mjy in the @xmath14 m window , a typical value for a low - luminosity region according to the isocam - cvf map ( mirabel et al .",
    "the instrument simulation is based on the mid - ir spectrum of the starburst galaxy m82 as observed by iso - sws ( sturm et al .",
    "2000 ) . despite the relative faintness and short integration time one can see a variety of important diagnostic lines ( see figure caption )"
