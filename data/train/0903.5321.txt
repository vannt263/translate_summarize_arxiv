    "physicists have long speculated that the fundamental constants might not , in fact , be constant , but instead might vary with time .",
    "dirac was the first to suggest this possibility @xcite , and time variation of the fundamental constants has been investigated numerous times since then . among the various possibilities , the fine structure constant and the gravitational constant have received the greatest attention , but work has also been done , for example , on constants related to the weak and strong interactions , the electron - proton mass ratio , and several others .",
    "it is well - known that only time variation of dimensionless fundamental constants has any physical meaning .",
    "here we consider the time variation of a dimensionless constant not previously discussed in the literature : @xmath0 .",
    "it is impossible to overstate the significance of this constant .",
    "indeed , nearly every paper in astrophysics makes use of it .",

    ".the value of @xmath0 measured at the indicated location at the indicated time . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the next section , we discuss the observational evidence for the time variation of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a theoretical model , based on string theory , which produces such a time variation , and we show that this model leads naturally to an accelerated expansion for the universe . the oklo reactor is discussed in sec .",
    "iv , and directions for future research are presented in sec . v.",
    "the value of @xmath0 has been measured in various locations over the past 4000 years . in table 1",
    ", we compile a list of representative historical measurements @xcite .",
    "we see evidence for both spatial and time variation of @xmath0 .",
    "we will leave the former for a later investigation , and concentrate on the latter . in fig . 1",
    ", we provide a graph illustrating the time variation more clearly .",
    "= 3.8truein    = 3.8truein    the values of @xmath1 show a systematic trend , varying monotonically with time and converging to the present - day measured value .",
    "the evidence for time variation of @xmath0 is overwhelming .",
    "inspired by string theory @xcite , we propose the following model for the time variation of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the possibility that our observable universe is actually a 4-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional bulk . in this case ,  slices \" of @xmath0 can leak into the higher dimension , resulting in a value of @xmath0 that decreases with time .",
    "this leakage into a higher dimension results in a characteristic geometric distortion , illustrated in fig .",
    "such  leakage \" has been observed previously in both automobile and bicycle tires .",
    "however , it is clear that more controlled experiments are necessary to verify this effect .",
    "it might appear that the observational data quoted in the previous section suggest a value of @xmath0 that increases with time , rather than decreasing as our model indicates .",
    "since our theoretical model is clearly correct , this must be attributed to 4000 years of systematic errors .",
    "now consider the cosmological consequences of this time variation in @xmath0 .",
    "the friedmann equation gives @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor and @xmath4 is the total density . at late times",
    "@xmath4 is dominated by matter , so that @xmath5 .",
    "hence , if @xmath0 increases faster than @xmath3 , the result will be an accelerated expansion .",
    "of course , our model gives the opposite sign for the time - variation of @xmath0 , but this is a minor glitch which is probably easy to fix .",
    "this model for the time variation of @xmath0 has several other consequences .",
    "it provides a model for the dark matter @xcite , and it can be used to derive a solution to the cosmological constant coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "further , it can be developed into a quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "no discussion of the time - variation of fundamental constants would be complete without a mention of the oklo natural fission reactor .",
    "this investigation clearly opens up an entirely new direction in the study of the time variation of fundamental constants . the next obvious possibility is the investigation of the time variation of @xmath6 . following this",
    ", there is a plethora of other constants that could be examined : the euler - mascheroni constant @xmath7 , the golden ratio @xmath8 , soldner s constant , and catelan s constant .",
    "more speculatively , one might consider the possibility that the values of the integers could vary with time , a result suggested by several early fortran simulations .",
    "this possibility would have obvious implications for finance and accounting .",
