    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is one of the most highly favoured extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , and is often considered to be a prime candidate for discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . with",
    "the start of experiments at the lhc now becoming imminent , it is natural and topical to make the best possible assessment of the likelihood that the lhc will indeed discover susy , based on the best available experimental , phenomenological and cosmological information .",
    "most of the current constraints on possible physics beyond the sm are negative , in the sense that they reflect the agreement of data with the sm , and set only lower limits on the possible masses of supersymmetric particles  @xcite .",
    "examples are direct constraints such as lower limits on specific sparticles , e.g. , the chargino , and indirect constraints such as the lower limit on the possible mass of a sm - like higgs boson  @xcite .    however , there are two observational constraints that , within the context of susy , may be used also to set upper limits on the possible masses of supersymmetric particles , since they correspond to measurements that can not be explained by the sm alone",
    ". these hints for new physics are the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath2 , which appears to differ by over three standard deviations from the best sm calculation based on low - energy @xmath3 data  @xcite , and the density of cold dark matter , @xmath4",
    "@xcite , which has no possible origin within the sm .",
    "each of these discrepancies has many possible interpretations , of which susy is just one .",
    "nevertheless , given the strong motivations for susy , which include the naturalness of the mass hierarchy and grand unification , as well as the existence of a plausible candidate for the astrophysical cold dark matter , it is natural to ask what @xmath2  and @xmath4 may imply for the parameters of supersymmetric models .",
    "any such analysis should also take into account the constraints imposed by precision measurements of electroweak observables ( ewpo ) and @xmath5-physics observables ( bpo ) such as br(@xmath6 ) , where most observables agree quite well with the sm .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the indirect information on supersymmetric model parameters obtainable in the light of these experimental , phenomenological and cosmological constraints , using a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this is practical only in simplified versions of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , in which some universality relations are imposed on the soft susy - breaking parameters .",
    "initially , we work in the framework of the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , in which the scalar and gaugino mass parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the trilinear coupling @xmath9 are each assumed to be equal at the input gut scale .",
    "furthermore as low - energy parameter we have @xmath10 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets . at the end",
    "we also comment on the possible changes in our results if the common soft susy - breaking contribution to the higgs scalar masses - squared , @xmath11 , is allowed to differ from those of the squarks and sleptons , the single - parameter non - universal higgs model or nuhm1 .",
    "there have been many previous studies of the cmssm parameter space  @xcite , including estimates of the sparticle masses , and a number of these have used mcmc techniques  @xcite .",
    "these have been used to extract the preferred values for the cmssm parameters using low - energy precision data , bounds from astrophysical observables and flavour - related observables .",
    "these analyses differ in the precision observables that have been considered , the level of sophistication of the theory predictions that have been used , and the way the statistical analysis has been performed .    here",
    "we use the mcmc technique to sample efficiently the susy parameter space , and thereby construct the @xmath12 probability function , @xmath13 .",
    "this accounts correctly for the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath14 , and thus represents a quantitative measure for the quality - of - fit .",
    "hence @xmath13 can be used to estimate the absolute probability with which the cmssm describes the experimental data .",
    "our probabilistic treatment is explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : mpfit ] .",
    "many previous analyses found evidence for a relatively low susy mass scale in the stau - coannihilation region , e.g. ,  @xcite , and a mild preference for @xmath15 was found in  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of bayesian analyses yielding varying results under different assumptions was made in  @xcite .",
    "some differences between analyses may also be traceable to the treatments of the br(@xmath6 )  and @xmath2  measurements , which we discuss in some detail below .",
    "our main objectives in this paper are threefold .",
    "one is to discuss explicitly the prospects for discovering sparticles in early lhc running , another is to discuss the robustness of the fit results by analyzing the implications of relaxing the constraints due to @xmath2 , br(@xmath6 ) , @xmath4 and other observables , and the third is to discuss the extension of the cmssm results to the nuhm1 , in which an extra parameter is introduced that allows a common degree of non - universality for the two higgs multiplets .",
    "we find that the 95%  c.l .",
    "area in the @xmath16 plane of the cmssm lies largely within the region that could be explored with 1  fb@xmath1 of integrated lhc luminosity at 14  tev in a single experiment , and that much of the 68%  c.l.area lies within the region that could be explored with 50  pb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at 10  tev ( the projected initial lhc collision energy )",
    ". a same - sign dilepton signal could well be visible in the 68%  c.l .",
    "area with 1  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at 14  tev , and the lightest higgs boson might also be detectable in squark decays with 2  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at 14  tev .",
    "we find that removing the @xmath4 constraint has little effect on the preferred regions of the cmssm parameter space in the @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 planes , apart from expanding the range of @xmath7 , particularly for @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , rescaling the present error in @xmath2  may have quite an important effect : the preferred ranges in @xmath8 and @xmath7 would expand quite significantly if the error on the present experimental discrepancy with the sm were to be increased .",
    "conversely , if this error could be reduced , e.g. , by a more precise measurement of @xmath2  and/or a more refined theoretical estimate within the sm , the predictions for sparticle masses could be significantly improved .",
    "we also discuss the effects of possible variations in the errors in br(@xmath6 )  and other observables .",
    "finally , we show that our results would not be greatly changed in the nuhm1 : we leave a more complete study of the nuhm1 and the nuhm2 ( in which the masses of the two higgs multiplets are independently non - universal ) for future work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     important observables used in our analysis are listed in tab .  [ tab : constraints ] . some of the ewpo that are included in the analysis have not been listed in the table , because they did not change since the analysis carried out in  @xcite ; their details can be found there .",
    "the deviation of @xmath2  from the sm prediction by more than @xmath20 can be easily accommodated within the ( c)mssm by choosing appropriately the sign of the higgs supermultiplet mixing parameter , @xmath21 : sign(@xmath21 ) = sign(@xmath22 ) .",
    "consequently , we analyze in detail the case @xmath23 , and discuss the @xmath24 case only briefly .    the central value of the br(@xmath6 )  constraint has changed slightly because of new experimental results : the data / sm ratio in tab .",

    "@xcite we still consider the above nnlo value as the most reliable sm estimate .",
    "as compared to @xcite , we have reduced the additional theoretical error in the calculation of the susy contribution , for the following reasons .",
    "first , it should be noted that all non - perturbative uncertainties cancel out in the susy / sm ratio .",
    "secondly , data force the deviations from the sm to be small in br(@xmath6 ) , so the susy / sm ratio can be computed to a relatively high degree of accuracy  ) yielding a br(@xmath6 )  rate close to the sm value ii )  the overall susy contribution is small because of cancellations among independent large terms .",
    "case i ) is excluded by the @xmath28 constraints  @xcite that we take into account in our numerical analysis .",
    "we deal with case ii ) by implementing in our code the leading nlo susy contributions , that are known within the mfv framework  @xcite . ] . a conservative @xmath29 error on the @xmath30 susy amplitude corresponds to less than @xmath31 in the br@xmath32 ratio in the region where this does not deviate from unity by more than 30% .",
    "the br(@xmath6)constraint , as well as all the other flavour - physics constraints listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : constraints ] , have been implemented using the code developed in refs .",
    "this includes the leading nlo qcd corrections to the supersymmetric contributions  @xcite and a complete resummation of all the relevant large @xmath10 effects beyond the lowest order  @xcite .",
    "more recent public codes for the evaluation of br(@xmath6 )  in the cmssm have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a significant @xmath5-physics constraint arises also from br(@xmath33 ) , which represents a powerful probe of the @xmath34 plane @xcite .",
    "however , at present both experimental and theoretical uncertainties prevent us from fully exploiting the potential sensitivity of this observable . in particular , the sm prediction suffers from the uncertainties in the determination of the ckm element @xmath35 and of the decay constant @xmath36 .",
    "concerning @xmath35 , we use the current hfag average @xcite ( from combined exclusive and inclusive semileptonic @xmath5 decays ) , while for @xmath36 we use the lattice result of  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to reduce the theoretical error associated to @xmath37 is to consider the ratio @xmath38 , where @xmath36 drops out and @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "however , as the experimental error on @xmath40 is the dominant uncertainty , this alternative way does not lead to a significant reduction in the error .",
    "moreover , it complicates the analysis since @xmath41 and @xmath42 are affected by independent susy contributions . for these reasons ,",
    "we treat the two constraints separately .",
    "more precisely , we treat separately @xmath40 , @xmath43 , and the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "similarly to br(@xmath6 ) , all flavour - physics constraints apart from br(@xmath45 are implemented normalising the observables to the corresponding sm values .",
    "the direct experimental limit on the higgs - boson mass in the sm obtained at lep  @xcite is @xmath46 at the 95% c.l .",
    "the corresponding bound within the mssm could in principle be substantially lower , due to a reduced zzh coupling or due to different , more complicated decay modes of the higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that these mechanisms can not be realised within the cmssm , and hence the experimental lower bound of 114.4  gev can be applied   well above this bound . ] . for our fit",
    "we use the full likelihood information of the exclusion bound , given by the @xmath47  value , which is convoluted with a theory error on the evaluation of @xmath48 of 3  gev  @xcite , according to the detailed prescription found in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation has been performed with the mastercode that consistently combines the codes responsible for rge running , for which we use softsusy  @xcite , and the various low - energy observables . at the electroweak scale",
    "we have included the following codes : feynhiggs  @xcite for the evaluation of the higgs masses and @xmath49 ; a code based on  @xcite and superiso  @xcite for the flavour observables ; a code based on  @xcite for the electroweak precision observables ; micromegas  @xcite and darksusy  @xcite for the observables related to dark matter .",
    "we made extensive use of the susy les houches accord  @xcite in the combination of the various codes within the mastercode .",
    "the cmssm parameter space has been sampled using the mcmc technique .",
    "we treat @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 as free parameters , and the higgs mixing parameter @xmath21 and the pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath50 as dependent parameters determined by the electroweak vacuum conditions .    a global @xmath12 function",
    "is defined , which combines all calculations with experimental constraints : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the number of observables studied , @xmath53 represents an experimentally measured value ( constraint ) and each @xmath54 defines a cmssm parameter - dependent prediction for the corresponding constraint .",
    "the three sm parameters @xmath55 are included as fit parameters and constrained to be within their current experimental resolution @xmath56 .    as indicated in section [ sec : intro ] , the sensitivity of the global fit to different constraint scenarios is studied below by removing the @xmath4 constraint or rescaling the @xmath2  and other experimental uncertainties .",
    "since each new scenario represents a new @xmath12 function which must be minimized , multiple re - samplings of the full multi - dimensional parameter space are , in principle , required to determine the most probable fit regions for each scenario and would be computationally too expensive .    to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we analyze the effect of removing the @xmath4 constraint by exploiting the fact that independent @xmath12 functions are additive and result in a well - defined @xmath12 probability .",
    "hence , a `` loose '' @xmath12 function , @xmath57 , is defined in which the term representing the @xmath4 constraint is removed from the original @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath57 function represents the likelihood that a particular set of model parameter values is compatible with a sub - set of the experimental data constraints , without any experimental knowledge of @xmath4 .    an exhaustive , and computationally expensive , 25 million point pre - sampling of the @xmath57 function in the full multi - dimensional model parameter space",
    "is then performed using an mcmc .",
    "the result of this pre - sampling identifies fit regions which are generally excluded by the considered sub - set of experimental data .",
    "any regions excluded by the less constrained fit will also be excluded with the inclusion of additional experimental constraints and , in particular , with different scenarios for the @xmath4 constraint .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , this pre - sampling procedure reduces the hyper - volume of parameter space which needs to be searched multiple times over in the context of different constraint scenarios to a computationally manageable level .",
    "constraint terms representing the different @xmath4 scenarios are then re - instated to form different @xmath58 functions , one for each scenario studied .",
    "the precise values of the most probable fit parameters are determined via a full minuit  @xcite minimization of the @xmath12 for each different scenario , but are performed only within the general parameter space regions not already excluded from the pre - sampling of the @xmath57 function .",
    "an mcmc final sampling is subsequently used to determine the 68% and 95% likelihood contours for each scenario constraint studied .",
    "additionally , later on we vary the uncertainties of @xmath4 and other constraints using similar techniques .",
    "this allows us to study and compare the effects of such variations on the @xmath12  fit and the most probable parameters .",
