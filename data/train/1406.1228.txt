    "we present l dwarf templates based on spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "these templates , calculated using methods adopted from @xcite , are both spectral standards and radial velocity ( rv ) standards that yield rvs with precisions of 720 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the l dwarf templates are publicly available .",
    "previously , bolometric fluxes for l dwarfs were derived using a combination of infrared spectra , model spectra , and @xmath8 photometry @xcite . in the last decade",
    ", there have been dramatic improvements in model atmospheres ( mostly centered around the treatment of clouds and dust condensation ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is due primarily to the faintness of mid- to late - l dwarfs ( the absolute @xmath18 magnitude falls from @xmath19 for l0 dwarfs to @xmath20 for l5 dwarfs and @xmath21 for l8 dwarfs ; s10 ) . to supplement the small numbers of mid- to late- l dwarfs , we conducted additional observations of 29 l4-l8 dwarfs using dis on the arc 3.5-m telescope .",

    "<S> we find that the @xmath3- and @xmath4-band bolometric corrections for late - m and l dwarfs have a strong correlation with @xmath5 and @xmath6 colors respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the new @xmath0 values , which can be used to convert h@xmath7 equivalent widths to activity strength , are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated sdss spectra and the new bolometric fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> while the measured @xmath0 values have typical uncertainties of @xmath120% , ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding h@xmath7 can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity . </S>",
    "<S> our semi - empirical @xmath0 values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous @xmath0 values for mid- to late - l dwarfs , indicating that the upper limits for h@xmath7 activity strength on the coolest l dwarfs have been underestimated . </S>"
