    "the exactly soluble landau - zener - stckelberg - majorana ( lzsm ) model @xcite is a very popular tool for estimating the transition probability between two quantum states whose energies cross in time .",
    "a level crossing in combination with adiabatic evolution is of great practical significance for it leads to complete population transfer between the two states ; various experimental level crossing techniques have been developed and demonstrated over the years @xcite .",
    "insofar as a quantum system is often immersed in a noisy environment , a number of studies have dealt with the effects of dissipative environments on this model @xcite .    despite its extreme simplicity  linearly changing energies and a constant coupling  the model often provides unexpectedly accurate results when applied to real physical systems with elaborate time dependences .",
    "this feature , and the appealing simplicity of the transition probability , have made this model vastly popular .",
    "there are several additional intriguing features associated with the model .",
    "it turns out that some standard _ approximate _ methods , e.g. the dykhne - davis - pechukas approximation @xcite , when applied to this model give the _ exact _ transition probability .",
    "moreover , when the upper state is allowed to decay irreversibly to other levels outside the two - state system with a decay rate @xmath0 the survival probability , i.e. the population of the lower state , does _ not _ depend on @xmath0 @xcite , while the population of the upper decaying state vanishes at large times .",
    "this is surprising because the evolution of the ground - state population does depend on @xmath0 : it approaches its asymptotic value smoothly for nonzero @xmath0 and in an oscillatory manner for @xmath1 .",
    "it is also remarkable that an adiabatic elimination of the decaying state provides the exact result for the ground - state population .",
    "it has been demonstrated that all these features are unique for the model and do not apply to any other model @xcite .",
    "the latter results for the lossy model have been obtained in the framework of the phenomenological inclusion of the decay rate in the schrdinger equation as an imaginary energy term in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this approach is known to be justified for weak decay .",
    "we have demonstrated recently that a rigorous microscopic master equation treatment , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , can deliver dramatically different results compared to the phenomenological approach in the description of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage technique in open three - state quantum systems in the regime of strong decay @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine the behavior of the model in an open quantum system by the master equation approach and verify its properties , e.g. , the validity of the independence of the survival probability on the decay rate .",
    "moreover , the microscopic approach allows us to study the model in the regime of nonzero bath temperature , which is inaccessible by the phenomenological approach . in view of the numerous applications of the model and the fact that a quantum system is often subjected to decoherence , our results are of potential significance in a number of physical systems @xcite , such as josephson junctions @xcite , cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , spinorial bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and others .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section we present the physical system , by starting from the ideal case and then introducing the interaction with a bosonic environment and deriving the relevant master equation . in the third section",
    "we compare numerical simulations obtained by our microscopic approach with predictions coming from the previously studied phenomenological model .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the dynamics on the temperature of the environment is simulated and explained by invoking the notion of dynamical decoupling . finally ,",
    "in the last section , we give some conclusive remarks .",
    "the ideal model comprises two quantum states @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupled by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath4 in order to model the interaction of this system with a dissipative environment , we add a third state @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we consider a three - state system described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7\\,.\\ ] ] we assume this model to be exact : this is possible for instance if the two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to two zeeman sublevels of an atom or a molecule splitted by a time - dependent magnetic field , while the coupling @xmath8 is induced by a static electric field in the presence of a dipole operator which has only real matrix elements , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the derivation of the hamiltonian for such a system , no rotating wave approximation is performed .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are    [ eq : eigenstates ] @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath8 are , in general , time - dependent . in the following",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath17 ( i.e. , static electric field ) and @xmath18 ( i.e. , linearly changing magnetic field ) , with @xmath19 spanning the range @xmath20 $ ] .    according to the calculations made in @xcite , where the time of interaction @xmath21 is assumed to be infinite , when the system is prepared in state @xmath2 at @xmath22 , the survival probability of state @xmath2 at @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 in the adiabatic limit , @xmath25 , the population of the initial state @xmath2 vanishes , @xmath26 , and complete population transfer @xmath27 takes place .",
    "this formula is approximately valid also for finite values of @xmath21 provided @xmath28 @xcite , because the coupling @xmath8 induces transitions between @xmath2 and @xmath3 only in the proximity of the level crossing .",
    "in other words , the formula ( [ eq : lz formula ] ) applies to finite times @xmath21 which are much larger than the characteristic transition time , which in the nearly - adiabatic regime is of the order of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath21 considered in the numerical simulations below will always satisfy the above condition .",
    "let us now consider the interaction with a bosonic bath , so that the system is described by    @xmath30    where @xmath31    the interaction hamiltonian in ( [ eq : hint ] ) has the form    @xmath32    with @xmath33    following the general theory of davies @xcite and the relevant consolidated approach @xcite , the master equation can be written down , by using standard methods @xcite , in terms of the instantaneous jump operators between the eigenstates ( [ eq : eigenstates ] ) of the system hamiltonian ,    @xmath34    moreover , since we are in the presence of a level crossing we may not be allowed to perform the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "therefore the master equation in the schrdinger picture is @xmath35 + \\sum_{\\omega,\\,\\omega'}\\,\\,\\ , \\gamma(\\omega ) [ a(\\omega)\\rho\\ , a^\\dag(\\omega ' ) \\\\ & - a^\\dag(\\omega ' ) a(\\omega ) \\rho ] + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the operator @xmath38 in the interaction picture at time @xmath19 . in the continuum limit",
    "we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coupling constant @xmath41 corresponding to the mode of frequency @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the density of the bath modes at frequency @xmath42 , and @xmath44 is the number of photons in each mode at frequency @xmath42 . since the latter quantity is the occupation number for a thermalized boson system : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the temperature and @xmath48 the boltzmann constant , the sign of @xmath42 is automatically taken into account since when @xmath49 one has @xmath50 .",
    "0.5 cm      we have integrated numerically the master equation ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) in order to find the behavior of the survival probability of the state @xmath2 after the interaction .",
    "we consider for simplicity a flat spectrum for the reservoir , i.e. we assume @xmath51 independently of @xmath42 .     at @xmath52 vs the decay rate @xmath0 ( in units @xmath8 ) at @xmath53 , for different values of the chirp parameter @xmath54 : @xmath55 ( red solid line ) , @xmath56 ( green dashed line ) , @xmath57 ( blue long dashed line ) . here",

    "@xcite a phenomenological model describing the level crossing transition in the presence of losses toward external states has been studied by adding an imaginary part ( @xmath62 ) to the energy of the state @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis there and previous work @xcite showed that the survival probability in the model does not depend on the decay rate at all .",
    "however , in the _ finite _ version of the model where the interaction duration is finite @xcite , and in several other analytic models , the phenomenological approach predicts an increase of the survival probability in the presence of strong damping ( dynamical decoupling ) : @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "our approach gives essentially the same zero - temperature dynamics as the one predicted by the phenomenological model for the finite lzsm transitions .",
    "figure [ fig : pop_gamma_t0 ] shows @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 ) as a function of the decay rate @xmath0 , for different values of the chirp parameter @xmath54 . as @xmath54 increases , the adiabaticity condition @xmath67 deteriorates and more population is left in the initial state at @xmath1 .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates that for low decay rates the survival probability is independent of @xmath0 , while it increases for larger values of @xmath0 . in the strong damping limit",
    "the survival probability approaches unity as in the phenomenological model .",
    "figure [ fig : pop_gamma_t0_tau ] shows the dependence of @xmath65 on both @xmath0 and @xmath21 , revealing that the dependence of the final population on the decay rate is only slightly affected by the duration time @xmath21 , and that for smaller values of @xmath0 the influence of @xmath21 is even less visible .",
    "however , we note that , increasing the value of @xmath21 , there is a slight shift of the region where the final population starts increasing with respect to @xmath0 . since the larger @xmath21 the larger the value of @xmath0 needed to see a significant increasing of the population @xmath65",
    ", one can conjecture that in the limit @xmath68 one can recover the independence of the population from @xmath21 predicted by the phenomenological model .",
    "nevertheless , developing this analysis is beyond our present numerical resources .     at @xmath52 as a function of the duration @xmath21 ( in units of @xmath69 , spanning the range @xmath70 $ ] ) and of the decay rate @xmath0 ( in units of @xmath8 ) .",

    "figures [ fig : pop_gamma_tv1 ] and [ fig : pop_gamma_tv4 ] show the survival probability as a function of the temperature for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the two figures refer to different values of the parameter @xmath54 : @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . in both figures ,",
    "one can see that there is a low temperature range where the behavior at zero temperature is reproduced .",
    "increasing the temperature , there is a zone with a more complicated dynamics , and in all cases one can see that for very high temperature the survival probability approaches unity .",
    "this is a universal feature of the dynamics related to this dissipative model , as we will show in the following .",

    "in fact , we are in the presence of a temperature - induced dynamical decoupling ( or temperature - induced quantum zeno effect ) .",

    "the time evolution predicted by our microscopic model at zero temperature and weak dissipation is nearly identical to the time evolution predicted by the well - known phenomenological approach or the original model ( assuming a constant coupling of infinite duration ) @xcite : the survival probability of state @xmath2 is independent of the decay rate . for strong dissipation",
    "we find that the initial - state population approaches unity , as in the finite model @xcite and other analytic models with couplings of finite duration @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of our microscopic approach is that it can describe also the dissipative dynamics for an environment at a nonzero temperature .",
    "a distinct feature in this case is the survival probability approach to unity for very high temperatures .",
    "the physical origin of this effect is the dynamical decoupling between state @xmath2 and the subspace spanned by states @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is induced by the very strong coupling between states @xmath3 and @xmath5 mediated by the interaction with the environment , which becomes stronger as the number of photons increases .",
    "it is important to note that in order to verify these results the initial state ( @xmath2 ) must not be electromagnetically coupled to the external state ( @xmath5 ) , so that all dissipation is due to state @xmath3 , as in ref .",
    "therefore this very peculiar feature of the high - temperature dynamics should be measurable in experimental situations where only one of the two states is unstable .",
