    "in a series of lattice studies  @xcite the gluon propagator in qcd has been computed at large momenta , and it was shown that its behavior was compatible with the perturbative expectation provided a rather large @xmath10 correction was considered . in an ope approach",
    "this correction has been shown  @xcite to stem from an @xmath0 gluon condensate which does not vanish since the calculations are performed in the landau gauge .",
    "it was also claimed  @xcite that this condensate might be related to instantons .",
    "the role of such a condensate in the non - perturbative properties of qcd , in particular its relation to confinement , has been studied by several groups  @xcite .",
    "of course any physics discussion about the @xmath0 condensate necessitates a clear definition of what we speak about , i.e. it needs a well defined renormalisation procedure to define the renormalised local @xmath0 operator , since @xmath11 is a quadratically divergent quantity as can easily be seen in perturbation theory .",
    "a renormalisation of @xmath0 was defined in  @xcite within the ope context which we now briefly summarise .",
    "it uses the notion of `` normal order product '' in a `` perturbative vacuum '' which is annihilated by the fields @xmath12 .",
    "it implies that @xmath13 in the perturbative vacuum .",
    "the contribution to @xmath14 in the true qcd vacuum is then of non - perturbative origin .",
    "it has only logarithmic divergences and it is multiplicatively renormalised .",
    "of course this notion of a perturbative vacuum in which fock expansion could be performed has not a very transparent physical meaning especially in a non - perturbative context such as the numerical euclidean path integral method .",
    "@xmath0 is not a gauge invariant operator but the bare @xmath0 condensate is a very special object since , by definition , it is a minimum of the gauge orbit  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "some important physics seems to lie beneath the brst invariance of @xmath0 in landau gauge .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite discussed on the generalised ] composite operator @xmath15 , which is brst invariant in the manifestly lorentz covariant gauge , and examined the survival of this invariance after renormalisation . in this note , although in a different context , we also examine the same point : the subtle relationship between the minimum of bare @xmath0 in the gauge orbit and any gauge - independant physical phenomenology associated to the renormalised condensate@xcite , emerging for instance from the ope analysis  @xcite . to this aim",
    ", we will derive the renormalised @xmath0 vacuum expectation value without using the normal ordering but using only the ope expansion of the gluon propagator . and",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath16 it will provide a more transparent definition , related directly to a quantity which is actually measured .",
    "we start from the observation that the non renormalised @xmath17 is related to the integral of the gluon propagator over momentum .",
    "hence it is expected that the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath0 has to do with the non - perturbative contribution to the gluon propagator .",
    "the latter contains precisely @xmath10 contributions due to the @xmath0 condensate at large momenta , and also strong deviations from perturbative qcd at small momenta , see fig .",

    "an example of such a non - perturbative propagator is shown in fig .",
    "we can choose for example the mom renormalisation scheme scheme does not fulfill this condition . ] , such that    [ mom ] g_r^(2)(p^2=^2)=1 ^2  .",
    "this implies a renormalisation of the gluon fields [ z3 ] a_r = z_3()^-1 2a_bare , z_3 ( ) ^2g_bare^(2)(^2 ) the renormalisation constant @xmath18 has to be understood as related to any regularisation method and any value of the uv regulator provided that the latter is larger than the momenta carried by the gluons .",
    "the coupling constant is also renormalised in the mom scheme .",
    "the yang - mills theory is thus fully renormalised and from now on we will consider only renormalised gauge fields and propagators .",
    "the propagator is defined in euclidean space by d^4 x e^ipx < a_r^a(0 ) a_r^b(x ) > = _ a , b g_r(p^2 ) inverting the fourier transform , [ four ] _",

    "if the gauge fields and the coupling constant have been renormalised , the local @xmath0 operator has not yet .",

    "( [ final ] ) presents a separation between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions to the integrated propagator i.e. to @xmath0 .",
    "of course , such a separation depends on the renormalisation scheme , and on the order in perturbation theory in which the green functions are computed .",
    "it is also well known that summing to infinity the perturbative series may generate renormalons which behave like non - perturbative condensates . to avoid any such problem",
    "we stick to a finite order in the perturbative series . furthermore ,",

    "( [ final ] ) . of course",
    "the anomalous dimensions to leading logarithms do not either depend on them .",
    "this simple result has several interesting consequences .",
    "first , it has been advocated   that the @xmath0 condensate could be dominantly due to the contribution to the path integral of semi - classical gauge field configurations such as instantons liquids .",
    "it is useful to consider this hypothesis through a background field picture , i.e. factorising the path integral into an integral over semi - classical gauge field configurations , and for each value of these an integral over quantum fluctuations around this background configuration .",

    "q^2(b=0 ) >",
    "i.e. that @xmath60 is subleading is a classical solution of the field equations , the term linear in @xmath61 will vanish .",
    "@xmath62 should be close to such a solution and we therefore neglect @xmath63 . ] . in other words",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath54 is subleading .",
    "the hard quantum fluctuations are not sensitive to the soft background field .",
    "a most interesting consequence of our result is related to some discussions in @xcite .",
    "these authors extend to qcd some remarks stemming from compact @xmath64 .",
    "they attribute a special role to the @xmath0 condensate , even if a gauge dependent quantity , by arguing that @xmath0 in the landau gauge is the minimum of @xmath0 on the gauge orbit .",
    "one difficulty in this argument is the following : fixing the landau gauge amounts to minimize the @xmath65 while the condensate refers to some renormalised quantity free of the quadratic and logarithmic divergences .",
    "in compact @xmath64 life is simpler : [ zakh ] < a^2_bare>= < a^2_pert > + < a^2_nonpert > , the perturbative theory is trivial and the nonperturbative contribution is due grossly speaking to the topology .",

    "last but not least , let us simply say that the result in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) provides a fairly simple understanding of what the @xmath0 condensate is .",
    "_ it confirms that indeed the @xmath3 correction to perturbative qcd at large momenta has to do with the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "_ indeed , if one start with some doubt about the relation of the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ defope ] ) with an @xmath0 condensate , just considering it as an unidentified @xmath10 contribution , we end - up with the conclusion that it yields a non - perturbative contribution to the @xmath0 v.e.v . the fact that in our derivation this term has precisely the anomalous dimension of an @xmath0 condensate comes form the fact that @xmath67 in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ defope ] ) has been computed under the assumption that it is due to an @xmath0 condensate , an assumption which has been shown to fit fairly well the lattice data .",
    "had we used another scale dependence for @xmath67 we would have ended with a wrong scale dependence for the resulting non - perturbative contribution to the @xmath0 v.e.v .",
