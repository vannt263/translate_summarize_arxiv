    "the general theory of relativity proposed by albert einstein provides a comprehensive and coherent description of gravity at the level of large - scale interactions .",
    "it is a geometrical theory which is formulated in such a way that space and time are not the absolute entities of classical mechanics , but rather , dynamical quantities determined together with the distribution and motion of matter and energy .",
    "notwithstanding the successes and experimental validations , in the last thirty years several shortcomings of gr were nevertheless found leaving the scientists with the idea that there is no reason to believe that gr is the only fundamental theory of gravitation  @xcite . among the alternative theories to gr ,",
    "the bd theory  @xcite is one of the simplest and well studied generalizations of gr with the aim to fully incorporate machs principle into the theory .",
    "though the cornerstone of gr is based on machs ideas , it admits solutions that are explicitly anti - machian such as g@xmath1del universe @xcite and pp - waves  @xcite . in bd theory the gravitational ( coupling )",
    "constant @xmath2 is no longer a constant and constitutes instead a field that varies in the spacetime , namely , by the inverse of a dynamical scalar field , named the bd scalar field .",
    "thus , within the framework of this theory the gravitational effects are described by two fundamental non - matter fields , i.e. , the metric tensor field @xmath3 and the bd scalar field @xmath4 .",
    "this field , in the jordan representation @xcite , couples to gravity with an adjustable parameter , @xmath5 , therefore acting as a mediator between matter fields and spacetime geometry .",
    "although the bd theory must agree with gr in the weak field regime , ( from the results of solar system experiments @xcite ) the theory predicts remarkable deviations from gr in the presence of strong gravitational fields , e.g. , superdense regimes of extreme gravity that occur during the dynamical evolution of the collapse process .",
    "the study of the collapse scenario in the framework of bd theory and its comparison to gr has attracted significant interest over the past decades .",
    "gravitational collapse of an ideal gas in bd theory has been investigated in @xcite using numerical simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics . using numerical techniques ,",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the collapse process of a spherically symmetric dust fluid and investigated the waveform and amplitude of scalar - type gravitational waves in the context of bd theory .",
    "the numerical results of both works suggest that the end product of a collapsed object in bd theory is the schwarzschild black hole , being in agreement with hawkings theorem @xcite which states that stationary black holes as the final state of gravitational collapse in bd theory are no different than gr gravity theories has been investigated in @xcite . ] .",
    "oppenheimer - snyder collapse in bd theory has been studied numerically in @xcite and the authors have concluded that the black holes produced as the final outcome of the collapse are in general similar to those in gr in final equilibrium , while they behave differently in comparison to gr , during the dynamical evolution .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that both the area and the apparent horizon theorems associated to dust collapse do not always hold for all values of the bd coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "theoretical as well as astrophysical aspects of collapse scenario and formation of black holes in scalar tensor theories have been widely investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the idea of non - commutativity between spacetime coordinates was first proposed by snyder @xcite in an attempt to introduce a short distance cut - off ( the non - commutative parameter ) in a lorentz covariant way in order to cure the renormalizability features of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "since then , there has been a great deal of interest in this research area ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main motivation was triggered by works establishing the connection between non - commutativity and string and m theory @xcite .",
    "several investigations have been carried out to study properties of non - commutative theories , such as ir / uv mixing and nonlocality  @xcite , lorentz symmetry violation  @xcite , new physics at very short distances @xcite and non - commutative classical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "non - commutative extensions of models concerning quantum mechanics such as the harmonic oscillator @xcite and the spectrum of hydrogen atom  @xcite have also been probed in order to seek for theoretical values of the non - commutative parameter .",
    "additionally , non - commutative settings are investigated to describe some physical effects such as quantum hall effect @xcite and landau problem @xcite .",
    "soon after non - commutative field theory appeared in the literature @xcite , the interest in this arena has made its way slowly but steadily into the realm of gravitational theories , from which several applications to non - commutative gravity @xcite have been proposed .",
    "however , different formulations of gravity theory in non - commutative spacetime have common being highly non - linear , so that the non - commutative equations of motion are too complicated to be solved .",
    "in addition , efforts have been devoted to verify the possible role of non - commutativity within newtonian cosmology @xcite , cosmological perturbation theory and inflationary cosmology @xcite , quantum cosmology @xcite and non - commutativity based on generalized uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "cosmological scenarios within the framework of non - commutative geometry provide us the formulation of semiclassical approximations of quantum gravity allowing to deal with the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , non - commutativity can provide a reasonable groundwork for non - singular cosmological scenarios where big - bang / crunch singularities are dissolved @xcite . in the context of kantowski - sachs cosmological model ,",
    "non - commutativity has been introduced into the classical phase space and classical non - commutative equations of motion have established @xcite .",
    "for scalar field cosmology , in @xcite the classical minisuperspace is deformed and a scalar field is used as the matter component of the universe and the cosmological constant problem and removability of initial curvature singularity is studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the study is focused on the consequences that the non - commutative deformation has on the slow - roll parameter , when an exponential potential for the scalar field is considered .",
    "in particular the non - commutative deformation gives a mechanism that ends inflation .",
    "the compactification and stabilization of internal extra dimensions in multidimensional cosmology at the presence of non - commutativity are studied in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the above cosmological models in the framework of classical non - commutativity is based on the assumption that modifying the poisson brackets of the classical theory gives the non - commutative equations of motion which leads to some non - trivial phenomena such as uv / ir mixing .    beside the cosmological models , of particular interest are non - commutative black hole solutions .",
    "physicists have believed that a quantum theory of gravity may resolve the black hole singularity problem . however , as they have not reached such a setting , yet , an appropriate insight can be provided by a quantum cosmology approach based on the minisuperspace approximation .",
    "indeed , it has been believed that the nonocommutativity of the space time can be relevant to the context of black hole physics  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a great amount of work has been done in search of non - singular neutral and charged black holes as the exact solutions of einsteins equations in non - commutative framework @xcite .",
    "more recently , the collapse scenario of a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field has been studied in the context of classical non - commutativity  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that contrary to the commutative case ( in which the collapse scenario ends in a spacetime singularity ) , introducing a non - commutativity between the momenta associated to the scale factor and the scalar field , the singularity can be either removed or instead attained faster .",
    "as discussed above , the process of gravitational collapse and singularity ( naked or covered ) formation has been a long standing issue in scalar - tensor theories of gravity . for a spatially flat  friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker  ( flrw ) metric in the absence of non - commutative effects , the solutions to the field equations of bd theory are shown to exhibit spacetime singularities , both in cosmological @xcite and gravitational collapse scenarios @xcite . from considering the non - singular cosmological models within non - commutative setting",
    ", we are motivated to get closer to the idea of curing the formation of spacetime singularities as the collapse end state in a non - commutative framework .",
    "assuming a spatially flat flrw metric , our aim here is to investigate the effects of classical non - commutativity on the collapse of a perfect fluid in bd theory .",
    "we argue that introducing non - commutativity ( with constant non - commutative parameter ) within the phase space , causes the behavior of classical trajectories of the collapse to be completely different in comntrast to the one obtained from the standard bd theory ( commutative case ) .",
    "we analyze in detail the solutions associated to some special cases , namely , when there is only a pressure - less matter and/or when the bd coupling parameter takes large values .",
    "our paper is then organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nc - bdt ] , we will derive the hamiltonian equations of motion for a concrete choice of deformation in the bd setting . in sec .",
    "[ nc - sr ] , assuming a vanishing scalar potential , we investigate numerically the collapse of barotropic matter .",
    "we show that non - commutative effects could remove the spacetime singularity occurring in the standard bd theory . finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl . ] , we summarize and discuss our results together with complementary discussions . in appendix",
    "[ appbd ] , by employing the taylor series about the bounce time , we present approximate analytic solutions for two special cases , the collapse of dust and stiff fluids within non - commutative bd theory .",
    "[ nc - bdt ] our aim in this section is to find the modified field equations in the context of bd theory when a special type of non - commutativity is present .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect fluid undergoing gravitational collapse in bd theory .",
    "we parametrize the interior spacetime of the collapsing volume with a spatially flat flrw line element given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scale factor and @xmath8 is a lapse function . for this line element ,",
    "the collapse scenario amounts to a cloud that begins to collapse from rest at an infinite initial radius @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , in the context of bd theory , the spacetime representing the above metric admits both cosmological @xcite as well as astrophysical singularities  @xcite .",
    "we are therefore motivated to investigate the existence of non - singular solutions by introducing non - commutativity between phase space coordinates .",
    "we shall see that such a deformation can be the agent for removing the spacetime singularity that occurs in standard collapsing scenarios in bd theory .",
    "now , we would consider a non - commutative scenario within the setting presented above . in this regard ,",
    "we can use two interesting different procedures for the deformation of poisson brackets , the moyal product ( or the star product ) and the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our investigation here is carried out by means of including the effects of non - commutativity on our classical setting .",
    "we therefore introduce a deformed product ( star product ) rule between two arbitrary observables of four - dimensional phase space as @xmath36f({{\\rm x}}_1,{{\\rm p}}_1)g({{\\rm x}}_2,{{\\rm p}}_2)|_{{{\\rm x}}_1={{\\rm x}}_2={{\\rm x}},\\,{{\\rm p}}_1={{\\rm p}}_2={{\\rm p}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are coordinates of phase space and @xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath42 antisymmetric matrices which represent the non - commutativity in coordinates and momenta , respectively and @xmath43 @xcite",
    ". the relation between the above star - product of phase space functions and the usual poisson brackets becomes more clear if the formula ( [ sh1 ] ) is expressed as follows @xcite @xmath44 where the bidifferential operator @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46_{{{\\rm x}_1 = { \\rm x}_2=q,\\,{\\rm p}_1={\\rm p}_2={\\rm p}}}.\\ ] ] according to equations ( [ sh1])-([r2 ] ) we obtain the following definition for the moyal bracket as a deformed poisson bracket @xmath47,\\]]which looks like an @xmath48-commutation relation between two function @xmath49 and @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the deformed poisson brackets between the phase space coordinates will be found as @xmath50      we should notice that in our herein non - commutative model by assuming that the coordinates have a length dimension , the scale factor and the bd scalar field are dimensionless quantities .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath40 is also a dimensionless constant . therefore restricting the non - commutative parameter to be positive",
    ", we take those values of this parameter for which @xmath63 . employing  ( [ ham-1 ] ) and  ( [ nc - poisson ] )",
    ", we obtain the equations of motion associated to the non - commutative model as ) and ( [ nc.h.eq2 ] ) , we have used the formulas @xmath64 and @xmath65 which are calculated from the non - commutative relations  ( [ nc - poisson ] ) , see , e.g. , @xcite . ]",

    "hence we have not rewritten them .",
    "we should also notice that when @xmath40 tends to zero , all the obtained equations associated to the non - commutative bd setting reduce to their corresponding ones in the usual bd theory .",
    "[ nc - sr ] equations  ( [ nc.h.eq1 ] ) and ( [ nc.h.eq2 ] ) together with ( [ diff.eq2 ] ) and ( [ diff.eq4 ] ) , govern the dynamics of the collapse in the presence of non - commutativity .",
    "interestingly , comparing equations ( [ diff.eq1 ] ) and ( [ nc.h.eq1 ] ) suggests that applying the non - commutativity ( [ nc - poisson ] ) to the phase space corresponds to shifting the collapse rate in equation ( [ diff.eq1 ] ) as @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , by comparing equations ( [ diff.eq3 ] ) and ( [ nc.h.eq2 ] ) , we observe that , in the presence of non - commutativity , the time derivative of the bd scalar field in equation ( [ diff.eq3 ] ) undergoes a shift as @xmath68 .",
    "we will see that the presence of these additional terms alter the classical evolution of the collapse scenario and finally causes the singularity avoidance at the semi - classical approximation .",
    "let us assume a simple case where the scalar potential vanishes .",
    "moreover , we take the matter content to be a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath69 , in which @xmath70 , @xmath13 and @xmath71 are the the pressure , energy density and the equation of state parameter , respectively .",
    "we assume that ordinary matter is conserved in the jordan representation of the bd theory when non - commutative effects are present .",
    "hence , we obtain [ coeq ] = _ ie^3(1+w)(_i- ) , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the initial values of energy density and logarithm of the scale factor , respectively .    by substituting the above expression into the set of equations ( [ diff.eq2 ] ) , ( [ diff.eq4 ] ) , ( [ nc.h.eq1 ] ) and ( [ nc.h.eq2 ] ) , we get & = & - -e^3,[eqsrew9 ] + & = & -(p_-2_)+48l_^4_i(1-w)e^3,[eqsrew10 ] + _ & = &",
    "48l_^4_i(1-w)e^3,[eqsrew5 ] + _ & = & ( p_-2_)p_+e^3.[eqsrew7 ] the above equations are a set of first order coupled non - linear differential equations which govern the collapse dynamics and evolution of bd scalar field .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to find exact analytical solutions since these equations are highly non - linear . notwithstanding",
    "this difficulty , we will discuss analytically these set of equations for two special cases , i.e. the dust @xmath74 and stiff @xmath75 fluids in appendix  [ appbd ] .",
    "let us then employ numerical methods in order to investigate solutions related to these equations .",
    "numerical analysis for the above equations needs four initial conditions , namely , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we choose the initial values for @xmath80 arbitrarily and the initial value for @xmath79 is set subject to equation ( [ eqsrew9 ] ) . in this sense , choosing the initial value for the collapse velocity as @xmath81 , we can solve equation ( [ eqsrew9 ] ) for @xmath79 to get the fourth initial value hence finding a consistent solution for the system ( [ eqsrew9])-([eqsrew7 ] ) . in the rest of this paper",

    "such strong field settings may not only suggest a few new experimental and observational viewpoints which might distinguish the difference between the predictions of the mentioned theories but they may also illustrate the structure of these theories . among mentioned strong field settings , we can allude the formation of the singularity and black hole during gravitational collapse which has been investigated in the herein work . on the other hand , as the scalar tensor gravitation involves more degrees of freedom , therefore , it yields a larger number of solutions than gr  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the employed noncommutative parameter in the bd theory may also couple to the variables which are absent in the gr and therefore may exceed the number of the solutions .",
    "we have found that introducing a special type of non - commutativity between phase space coordinates could alter the final fate of the collapse process of a perfect fluid in bd theory .    assuming the interior geometry of the collapsing cloud to be that of a spatially flat flrw spacetime , we employed a particular type of non - commutativity between the phase space coordinates and examined its effects on the collapse dynamics .",

    "[ f19 ] and fig .",

    "more precisely , for small values of @xmath40 , the softness of the bounce depends effectively on the values taken by @xmath203 , i.e. , matter pressure , and @xmath5 . for a non - dust case , as the pressure of the fluid tends to positive values , the collapse dynamics is altered such that the location and the number of the dynamical horizons are changed .",
    "such a situation similarly happens as the bd coupling parameter increases ( for a fixed value of eos parameter ) .",
    "the strength of the scalar to tensor coupling to the matter is encoded in the bd coupling parameter so that the smaller the value of @xmath5 parameter , the larger the contribution of the scalar field to gravitational interaction .",
    "as we found in the herein model , the coupling of the scalar to tensor field to matter content could affect the softness of the bounce and the time interval during which the bounce occurs . in this manner",
    "we could say that the stronger the contribution of the bd scalar field to the gravitational interaction ( i.e. , the @xmath5 parameter decreases ) , the softer the bounce occurs .",
    "the behavior of the apparent horizon curve for a dust collapse has been also analyzed according to figs .",
    "[ rahh ] and [ rahaaw ] .",
    "it is seen that the dynamics of the apparent horizon in the case in which non - commutative effects are present is quite different to the case where these effects are absent . more concretely ,",
    "when the non - commutative parameter takes small values , the formation or otherwise of the dynamical horizons depend crucially on the behavior of the collapse velocity .",
    "recent observations of radiation damping in mixed binary systems have put limitations on the bd coupling parameter as @xmath204 from the cassini measurements @xcite . in our scenario , we have shown that when @xmath5 takes very large values goes to infinity , the bd theory may reduce to the gr  @xcite . ] , we can find a critical value for the non - commutative parameter , i.e. , @xmath205 , which completely disassociates two different dynamical behaviors for the collapsing object , see fig .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath206 , the scale factor decreases till reaching a minimum value and stays at this value as the time evolves .",
    "whilst , for @xmath207 , the collapse culminates in a spacetime singularity with completely different dynamics compared to the case where the non - commutative effects are absent .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath205 depends on the initial values which are taken by the present parameters of the model .",
    "we have also studied the collapse associated to a pressureless fluid for negative values of the bd coupling parameter . as the left panel in fig .",
    "[ omega- ] indicates , the scale factor starts its decreasing behavior till reaching the bounce , beyond which an increasing oscillatory behavior commences .",
    "the collapse velocity experiences an oscillatory phase such that at the earlier times , it oscillates toward its first vanishing point at the time @xmath208 ( see the right panel of fig . [ omega- ] ) .",
    "note that the speed of collapse remains negative for @xmath209 .",
    "it is therefore the acceleration of the collapse that changes its sign rapidly , signaling that the collapsing object experiences a series of decelerating ( see the red arrow heading upward from points a to b ) and accelerating ( see the blue arrow heading downward from the points b to c ) contracting regimes with a soft jump from the former to the latter ( at point b ) but a quick jump from the latter to the former ( at point a or c ) .",
    "for @xmath210 the scenario enters an accelerated expanding phase for the first time ( at @xmath211 ) and remains in this regime in the time interval @xmath212 .",
    "it then goes again under a decelerated expanding phase between @xmath213 till it enters an accelerated contracting phase which occurs for @xmath214 .",
    "this oscillatory behavior continues around the zero point velocity .",
    "we should note that the frequency of the oscillation of collapse velocity decreases with time .",
    "moreover , the corresponding envelop of the oscillatory phase is also damping with time .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there exists a difference between the behavior of collapse velocity for this case and the case where @xmath215 . in the former , though the scale factor vanishes at a finite amount of time ( singular behavior ) , the speed of collapse is limited ( see the dashed curve in the right panel of fig .  [ omega- ] ) so that by a suitable choice of the boundary of the collapsing body , the formation of the apparent horizon can be avoided .",
    "thus , the collapse may culminate in a naked singularity . for the latter ,",
    "the collapse velocity diverges in the limit of approach to the singularity and the apparent horizon would always form to cover the resulting singularity . the lower panel in fig .",
    "( [ omega- ] ) shows the collapse velocity for different values of bd coupling parameter .",
    "it is seen that the larger the negative value of @xmath5 parameter , the smaller the frequency of oscillation .    to complete the collapse model",
    ", we performed matching the interior spacetime with that of generalized vaydia spacetime using the generalized israel - darmois junction conditions .",
    "we observed that as long as there is no surface stress energy on the boundary of the collapsing cloud , the extrinsic curvature tensor is continuous across the boundary .",
    "this makes the exterior spacetime to be static with a dynamical boundary so that the horizon could intersect the boundary depending on the initial size of the collapsing body .",
    "thus , if the initial size of the collapsing object is taken as small as enough , horizon formation could be avoided .",
    "we then conclude that the process of gravitational collapse in the presence of non - commutativity would lead to a non - singular bounce , that is uncovered by the horizon and so it can be causally connected to an external observer .",
    "we would like to compare our results to other collapse scenarios as reported in the literature .",
    "work along this line has been done within the @xmath216 gravity models which correspond to the bd theory with a vanishing coupling parameter , using the metric formalism . in this context",
    ", it has been shown that the collapse process of a perfect fluid leads to a spacetime singularity which can be either hidden behind a horizon or visible to external observers @xcite . besides the model presented here , non - singular bouncing scenarios have also been reported in the literature such as @xmath216 theories in palatini formalism @xcite , generalized teleparallel gravity theories @xcite , bouncing models in the presence of interacting spinning particles in the framework of einstein - cartan theory in both cosmological @xcite and astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "non - singular bouncing scenarios have also been reported in loop quantum cosmology for a massless scalar field @xcite and in the presence of anisotropy @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , we should be aware of the following notes about the herein model : ( i ) all the results of this paper have been obtained for a simple case in which we have introduced a constant non - commutative parameter within the standard bd theory , a homogeneous matter distribution and a spatially flat flrw line - element for the interior region suitably matched to a generized vaidya spacetime as the exterior solution .",

    "<S> we study the collapse process of a homogeneous perfect fluid ( in flrw background ) with a barotropic equation of state in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory in the presence of phase space deformation effects . </S>",
    "<S> such a deformation is introduced as a particular type of non - commutativity between phase space coordinates . for the commutative case </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown in the literature @xmath0 $ ] , that the dust collapse in bd theory leads to the formation of a spacetime singularity which is covered by an event horizon . in comparison to general relativity ( gr ) </S>",
    "<S> , the authors concluded that the final state of black holes in bd theory is identical to the gr case but differs from gr during the dynamical evolution of the collapse process . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of non - commutative effects influences the dynamics of the collapse scenario and consequently a non - singular evolution is developed in the sense that a bounce emerges at a minimum radius , after which an expanding phase begins . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is observed for positive values of the bd coupling parameter . for large positive values of the bd coupling parameter , </S>",
    "<S> when non - commutative effects are present , the dynamics of collapse process differs from the gr case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that for negative values of the bd coupling parameter , the singularity is replaced by an oscillatory bounce occurring at a finite time , with the frequency of oscillation and amplitude being damped at late times . </S>"
