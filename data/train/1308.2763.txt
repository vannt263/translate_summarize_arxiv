    "the force exerted by a single photon on a macroscopic mechanical resonator is typically weak and intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "experiments to date have focused on the regime of strong optical driving , where the optomechanical coupling can by enhanced by a factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean photon number in the cavity @xcite .",
    "but such enhancement comes at the expense of making the effective interaction linear .",
    "recently , it has been reported that single - photon strong - coupling regime , where the single - photon optomechanical coupling rate @xmath2 exceeds the cavity decay rate @xmath3 , can be realized in single - mode @xcite or two - mode optomechanical systems @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the inherently nonlinear optomechanical interaction is significant at the level of single photons and phonons .    among all the nonlinear phenomenon in a cavity optomechanical system ,",
    "optical bistability is one of the focuses of research interest .",
    "recently , the bistable behavior of the mean intracavity photon number in optomechanical systems with a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , ultracold atoms @xcite and a quantum well @xcite has been extensively studied .",
    "the photon number in the optical cavity with a bec or ultracold atoms to allow bistable behavior is usually low and even below unity due to the collective atomic motion .",
    "however , in the generic optomechanical system consisted of an empty optical cavity with one movable end mirror , optical bistability typically occurs at high photon numbers .",
    "producing such phenomena at very low photons number is desirable for applications from optical communication to quantum computation . in the present paper ,",
    "we theoretically investigate the bistable behavior of the intracavity photon number in a two - mode optomechanical system in the simultaneous presence of two strong pump laser beams and a weak probe laser beam . by adjusting the frequency and power of the pump beams",
    ", we can efficiently control the optical bistability in each cavity .",
    "in particular , one can control the bistable behavior in the right cavity by adjusting the pump beam driving the left cavity .",

    "the largest and smallest roots are stable , and the middle one is unstable , which is represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "furthermore , we can see that larger cavity - pump detuning is necessary to observe the optical bistable behavior with the increasing pump beam power .",

    "3 that the mean intracavity photon number @xmath82 keeps constant when the left cavity - pump detuning @xmath83 changes .",

    "however , when @xmath90 , the intracavity photons in the left cavity will have an effect on the common nanomechanical resonator and subsequently the photon number in the right cavity .",
    "the simultaneous presence of the left pump and probe beam induces a radiation pressure force at the beat frequency @xmath31 , which drives the mechanical mode to oscillate coherently . when @xmath91 , the highly off - resonant stokes scattering at the frequency @xmath92 is strongly suppressed and only the anti - stokes scattering at the frequency @xmath93 builds up within the right cavity , leading to the up - conversion of the pump photons to the cavity photons at the frequency @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the average photon number in the right cavity is lager than the constant value without of the effect of the left cavity . on the other hand , when @xmath77 , the anti - stokes scattering is strongly suppressed while the stokes scattering at the frequency @xmath92 builds up within the cavity , leading to the down - conversion of cavity photons at the frequency @xmath94 to the pump photons . in this case",
    ", the average photon number in the right cavity is smaller than the constant value when @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , by adjusting the left cavity - pump beam detuning @xmath83 , one can observe the bistable behavior of the intracavity photon number in the right cavity .",

    "in what follows , we will show that two - mode optomechanical system allows for optical bistability at extremely low cavity photon numbers .",

    ", intracavity photon number in the right cavity is very small , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "generally , such low photon numbers can not exhibit bistable behavior in the empty cavity optomechanical systems .",
    "however , in the two - mode optomechanics we consider here , when the left cavity is driven by a strong pump power , because the two cavities are coupled to a common nanomechanical resonator , optical bistability can still exist in the right cavity at the extremely low intracavity photon numbers .",
    "this phenomenon signifies the strong nonlinear effects in the weak coupling regime @xcite , which is enabled by the long lifetime of the mechanical mode and the strong pump on the left cavity .",

    "_ @xcite and kuzyk _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also shown that strong nonlinearities can be obtained in two - mode optomechanical systems in the weak coupling regime . as pointed out by previous works ,",
    "the bistable behavior of intracavity photon numbers in the two - mode optomechanical system under consideration also provides a candidate of realizing a controllable optical switch .",
    "for this , the two stable branches of photon numbers in the right cavity act as the optical switch .",
    "when the frequency and power of the left pump beam are fixed , the switch between the lower stable branch and the upper stable branch can be easily realized by controlling the frequency and power of the right pump beam .",
    "furthermore , the left pump beam can be used as a control parameter to enable or disable this switch .",
    "when the photon number in the right cavity is less than one , if we turn off the left pump beam , the bistable behavior disappears and only one stable branch exists .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the optical bistability in a two - mode optomechanical system where two optical cavities are coupled to a common mechanical resonator via radiation pressure force .",
    "compared with the generic single - mode cavity optomechanics , such a two - mode optomechanical system allows one to control the optical bistability in a much more flexible way .",
    "the bistable behavior of the mean intracavity photon number in one cavity can be tuned by the power and frequency of the pump laser beam driving another cavity .",
    "furthermore , bistability at low photon numbers below unity should be possible in such a coupled system .",
