    "the milky way to which our sun belongs , contains about 100 billion stars . on even larger scales",
    ", individual galaxies are concentrated into clusters of galaxies .",
    "these clusters consist of the galaxies and any material which is in the space between the galaxies .",
    "the force that holds the cluster together is gravity .",
    "the space between galaxies in clusters is filled with a hot gas .",
    "the cluster includes the galaxies and any material which is in the space between the galaxies .",
    "the gas is hot enough to make this space shine in x - rays instead of visible light . by studying the distribution and temperature of the hot gas we can measure the force of gravity from all the material in the cluster .",
    "this allows us to determine the total material content in that cluster .",
    "it appears that there is five times more material in clusters of galaxies than the galaxies and hot gas which we can see add up to .",
    "that is most of the matter in clusters of galaxies is invisible and , since these are the largest structures in the universe held together by gravity , many scientists then deduce that most of the matter in the entire universe is invisible . this invisible matter",
    "is called dark matter. over the years there has been a lot of research by scientists attempting to discover exactly what this dark matter is , how much there is , and what effect it may have on the future of the universe as a whole .",
    "fritz zwicky was the first to note in 1933 that the outlying galaxies in the coma cluster were moving much faster than mass calculated for the visible galaxies and this would indicate that there is dark matter .",
    "vera rubin used galactic rotation curves to deduce that there was dark matter in galaxies .these rotation curves showed how average velocity of stars change with distance from center of galaxy .",
    "the observed rotation curves differed from the theoretical ones based on keplerian orbits as can be seen in figures [ fig:1a ] and [ fig:1b ] .",
    "we would first like to observe that even after all these decades there is neither evidence for the hypothesized dark matter , nor any clue to its exact nature , if it exists .",
    "let us see how varying @xmath0 dynamics removes the need for dark matter thus providing an alternative explanation .",
    "cosmologies with time varying @xmath0 have been considered in the past , for example in the brans - dicke theory or in the dirac large number theory or in the model of hoyle @xcite . in the case of the dirac cosmology ,",
    "the motivation was dirac s observation that the supposedly large number coincidences involving @xmath1 , the number of elementary particles in the universe had an underlying message if it is recognized that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the age of the universe .",
    "equation ( [ 3ea1 ] ) leads to a @xmath0 decreasing inversely with time in dirac s hypothetical development .",
    "+ the brans - dicke cosmology arose from the work of jordan who was motivated by dirac s ideas to try and modify general relativity suitably . in this scheme",
    "the variation of @xmath0 could be obtained from a scalar field @xmath4 which would satisfy a conservation law .",
    "this scalar tensor gravity theory was further developed by brans and dicke , in which @xmath0 was inversely proportional to the variable field @xmath4 .",
    "( it may be mentioned that more recently the ideas of brans and dicke have been further generalized . )",
    "+ in the hoyle - narlikar steady state model , it was assumed that in the machian sense the inertia of a particle originates from the rest of the matter present in the universe .",
    "this again has been shown to lead to a variable @xmath0 .",
    "the above references give further details of these various schemes and their shortcomings which have lead to their falling out of favour .",
    "+ then there is fluctuational cosmology in which particles are fluctuationally created from a background dark energy , in an inflationary type phase transition and this leads to a scenario of an accelerating universe with a small cosmological constant .",
    "this 1997 work @xcite was observationally confirmed a year later due to the work of perlmutter and others @xcite . moreover in this cosmology , the various supposedly miraculous large number coincidences as also the otherwise inexplicable weinberg formula which gives the mass of an elementary particle in terms of the gravitational constant and the hubble constant are also deduced from the underlying theory rather than being ad hoc.to quote the main result , the gravitational constant is given by @xmath5 where @xmath3 is time ( the age of the universe ) and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "furthermore , other routine effects like the precession of the perihelion of mercury and the bending of light , and so on have also been explained in this model .",
    "moreover in this model , the cosmological contant @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 and shows an inverse dependence @xmath9 on time .",
    "we will see that there is observational evidence for ( [ 3ea2 ] ) .",
    "+ with this background , we now give some tests for equation ( [ 3ea2 ] ) .",
    "let us first see the correct gravitational bending of light .",
    "in fact in newtonian theory too we obtain the bending of light , though the amount is half that predicted by general relativity@xcite . in the newtonian theory",
    "we can obtain the bending from the well known orbital equations ( cf.@xcite ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass of the central object , @xmath12 is the angular momentum per unit mass , which in our case is @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the impact parameter or minimum approach distance of light to the object , and @xmath15 the eccentricity of the trajectory is given by @xmath16 for the deflection of light @xmath17 , if we substitute @xmath18 , and then use ( [ 3ey26 ] ) we get @xmath19 this is half the general relativistic value . +",
    "we now observe that in this case we have , @xmath20 @xmath21    we now observe that the effect of time variation of @xmath22 is given by equation ( [ 3ey16])(cf.ref.@xcite ) . using this ,",
    "the well known equation for the trajectory is given by , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "+ the first term on the right hand side represents the newtonian contribution while the remaining terms are the contributions due to ( [ 3ey16 ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ 3ey28 ] ) is given by @xmath26\\label{3ey29}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a constant of integration .",
    "corresponding to @xmath28 in the newtonian case we have in the present case , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is large and infinite for practical purposes . accordingly",
    "the analogue of the reception of light for the observer , viz .",
    ", @xmath31 in the newtonian case is obtained by taking @xmath32 in ( [ 3ey29 ] ) which gives @xmath33 comparison of ( [ 3ey30 ] ) with the newtonian solution obtained by neglecting terms @xmath34 in equations ( [ 3ey28 ] ) and ( [ 3ey29 ] ) shows that the newtonian @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath35 , whence the deflection obtained by equating the left side of ( [ 3ey30 ] ) to zero , is @xmath36 where @xmath15 is given by ( [ 3ey26 ] ) .",
    "the value of the deflection from ( [ 3ey31 ] ) is twice the newtonian deflection given by ( [ 3ey27 ] ) . that is the deflection @xmath17",
    "is now given not by ( [ 3ey27 ] ) but by the formula , @xmath37 the relation ( [ 3ey32 ] ) is the correct observed value and is the same as the general relativistic formula which however is obtained by a different route @xcite .",
    "we now come to the problem of galactic rotational curves mentioned earlier ( cf.ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we would expect , on the basis of straightforward dynamics that the rotational velocities at the edges of galaxies would fall off according to @xmath38 however as seen in section ( 1 ) , it is found that the velocities tend to a constant value , @xmath39 as we approach the edges of the galaxies .",
    "this , as noted , has lead to the postulation of the as yet undetected additional matter alluded to , the so called dark matter.(however for an alternative view point cf.@xcite ) .",
    "we observe that from ( [ 3ey16 ] ) it can be easily deduced that @xcite @xmath40 as we are considering infinitesimal intervals @xmath41 and nearly circular orbits . equation ( [ 3ey35 ] ) shows ( cf.ref@xcite also ) that there is an anomalous inward acceleration , as if there is an extra attractive force , or an additional central mass .",
    "+ so , we now have @xmath42 from ( [ 3ey36 ] ) it follows that @xmath43 from ( [ 3ey37 ] ) it is easily seen that at distances within the edge of a typical galaxy , that is @xmath44 the equation ( [ 3ey33 ] ) holds but as we reach the edge and beyond , that is for @xmath45 we have @xmath46 per second , in agreement with ( [ 3ey34 ] ) .",
    "in fact as can be seen from ( [ 3ey37 ] ) , the first term in the square root has an extra contribution ( due to the varying @xmath0 ) which is roughly some three to four times the second term , as if there is an extra mass , roughly that much more .",
    "in fact the velocity at the edge of the galaxies as calculated from equation ( [ 3ey35 ] ) are tabulated in the following table , where the radius is in units of @xmath47 cm .",
    "the table shows that equation ( [ 3ey35 ] ) is in agreement with the observed velocity given in equation ( [ 3ey32 ] ) .",
    "@xmath48 thus the time variation of @xmath0 explains observation without invoking dark matter.it may be added that this also explains the latest studies by metz , kroupa and others of the satellite galaxies of the milky way galaxy , which also throw up the faster than expected rotational velocities , ruling out however , in this case dark matter , in addition .",
    "there could be other explanations , too .",
    "one of the authors and a.d .",
    "popova have argued that if the three dimensionality of space asymptotically falls off , then the above can be explained @xcite .",
    "+ yet another prescription was given by milgrom @xcite who approached the problem by modifying newtonian dynamics at large distances .",
    "it must be mentioned that this approach is purely phenomenological .",
    "+ the idea was that perhaps standard newtonian dynamics works at the scale of the solar system but at galactic scales involving much larger distances perhaps the situation is different . however a simple modification of the distance dependence in the gravitation law , as pointed by milgrom would not do , even if it produced the asymptotically flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "such a law would predict the wrong form of the mass velocity relation .",
    "so milgrom suggested the following modification to newtonian dynamics : a test particle at a distance @xmath22 from a large mass @xmath11 is subject to the acceleration @xmath49 given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an acceleration such that standard newtonian dynamics is a good approximation only for accelerations much larger than @xmath51 .",
    "the above equation however would be true when @xmath49 is much less than @xmath51 .",
    "both the statements in ( [ 3em1 ] ) can be combined in the heuristic relation @xmath52 in ( [ 3em2 ] ) @xmath53 when @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "it must be stressed that ( [ 3em1 ] ) or ( [ 3em2 ] ) are not deduced from any theory , but rather are an ad hoc prescription to explain observations .",
    "interestingly it must be mentioned that most of the implications of modified newtonian dynamics or mond do not depend strongly on the exact form of @xmath56 .",
    "+ it can then be shown that the problem of galactic velocities is now solved @xcite .",
    "+ finally it maybe mentioned that the above varying @xmath0 dynamics explains the puzzling anomalous acceleration of the pioneer spacecrafts of the order of @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xmath59 observed by j.d.anderson of the jpl pasadena , and co - workers @xcite .    99 barrow , j.d . and parsons , p.
