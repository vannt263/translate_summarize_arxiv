    "the very powerful supernova ( sn ) explosions called `` hypernovae '' @xcite are perhaps the most energetic events in the current universe .",
    "their kinetic energy is @xmath4 ergs , which is about 10 times larger than of normal sne .",
    "sn  1998bw , probably associated with grb 980425 @xcite , was the first recognized hypernova .",
    "although classified as a type ic sn ( sn  ic ) , the spectrum of sn  1998bw showed unusual broad spectral features in the early phase .",
    "the derived velocities were as large as 30,000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the kinetic energy of sn  1998bw was deduced to be 3  5 @xmath5 10@xmath6 ergs @xcite .",
    "other type ic hypernovae were subsequently recognized based on their broad absorption features .",
    "these include sne  1997ef ( e.g. , iwamoto et al.2000 ) , 1998ey @xcite , and the recently discovered 2002bl @xcite .",
    "moreover , sn  1997dq was suggested to be a hypernova from its similarity to sn  1997ef at later phases @xcite . the kinetic energy deduced for sn  1997ef was about @xmath7 ergs ( mazzali , iwamoto , & nomoto 2000 ) , which was smaller than that of sn  1998bw , but still significantly larger than normal sne .",
    "hypernovae also occur among sne  iin , for example , sn  1997cy , one of the brightest sne ever discovered and characterized by a large kinetic energy , @xmath8 ergs @xcite , and sn  1999e ( cappellaro , turatto , & mazzali 1999 ) .",
    "the range of properties of hypernovae , and their possible association with grbs are also topics of great interest ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 2001 ) .",
    "sn  2002ap was discovered in m74 on january 29.4 ut by y.hirose @xcite .",
    "spectra obtained on january 30  31 showed very broad absorption features , resembling those in sne  1998bw and 1997ef .",
    "therefore , sn  2002ap was suggested to be a hypernova @xcite .",
    "sn  2002ap is the nearest hypernova discovered to date , hence it was a good target even for small telescopes .",
    "various multi - wavelength observations of sn  2002ap have been performed ( summarized in gal - yam , ofek , & shemmer 2002 ) .",
    "nir photometry was also performed frequently at gunma astronomical observatory ( gao ) ( e.  nishihara et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we report here on the optical spectroscopy of sn  2002ap performed at gao .",
    "we compare the spectra of sn  2002ap with those of other hypernovae .",
    "we also used the parameterized sn synthetic - spectrum code synow to perform line identification and deduce velocity information from the spectra in the early phase , when very broad features resulting from line - blending were present .",
    "observations of sn  2002ap started on the night of the discovery report .",
    "nightly early phase spectral observations were carried out at gao and bisei astronomical observatory ( bao ) for about 40 days , from discovery to solar conjunction .",
    "spectra were obtained with gunma compact spectrograph ( gcs ) attached to the classical - cassegrain focus of the gao 65 cm telescope ( f/12 ) and with a spectrograph attached to the bao 1.01-m telescope ( f/12 ) .",
    "the spectral resolving power ( @xmath9 ) of gcs is about 500 at 5500   and the wavelength coverage is from 3800 to 7600  .",
    "the bao spectrograph covers from 4700 to 7000   with a resolving power of about 1000 .",
    "observational parameters are listed in table 1 . since",
    "all the spectra were obtained with narrow slits ( 2@xmath10 on gcs and 2.6@xmath10 at bao , compared to a typical seeing of 2 - 3@xmath10 ) and the sky conditions were generally non - photometric , the flux was not on an absolute flux scale .",
    "the slit was aligned in e - w direction at gao and in the n - s direction at bao , which in both cases was not the parallactic angle .",
    "consequently , the blue end of the spectra could be significantly affected at advance epochs , as the observations were done at low altitude . in those cases",
    ", we cut the blue end of the spectra ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "data reduction was performed with iraf .",
    "calibration for the relative intensity was performed based on the observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "a fe - ne - ar lamp for gao and a fe - ne lamp for bao were used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the time - sequence of the calibrated spectra of sn  2002ap is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the evolution of the spectra is apparent .",
    "as time progresses , most absorption features shift to the red , and the continuum becomes redder .",
    "the first two spectra , taken on the same night , show a blue continuum , with neither deep absorptions nor strong emissions ( see also the top of figure 2 ) .",
    "broad and shallow depressions are seen near 4700 , 5700 , and 6200  .",
    "these broad features resemble those of sne  1998bw and 1997ef in the earliest phases @xcite",
    ". however , sn  2002ap is bluer , possibly because it was caught at an earlier epoch .",
    "the fact that the first observations must have been very close to the time of explosion is exemplified by the rapid development of spectral features .",
    "the first two spectra also show a broad peak near 5000 .",
    "but in the third spectrum taken the following night , this peak has shifted significantly to the red ( @xmath11 ) , indicating a rapid decrease of the material velocity sampled by the spectra , as the photosphere moves inwards .",
    "photometric observation at wise observatory established that the peak of the light curve occurred on february 7.1 and 8.8 ut in the @xmath12 and @xmath13-band , respectively @xcite .",
    "we designate the epochs using the number of days from @xmath12 maximum .",
    "figure 2 also shows the spectrum of sn  2002ap taken on day @xmath142 ( february 9.4 ut ) , near the time of maximum . we compared this with the near - maximum spectra of other sne  ic :",
    "sne  1998bw , 1997ef ( hypernovae ) and 1994i ( a normal sn  ic ; nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ) . based on the line width",
    ", the spectra can easily be separated into two groups .",
    "one is that of `` hypernovae '' , including sne  1998bw , 1997ef , and 2002ap , while the other includes only the normal type ic sn  1994i .",
    "therefore , sn  2002ap is easily identified as a hypernova . moreover",
    ", the spectrum of sn  2002ap shows emission - like features around 4600 and 5300  , resembling the spectrum of sn  1997ef more than that of sn  1998bw .    in figure 3",
    "we compare similar - looking spectra of sne  2002ap and 1997ef .",
    "we can see that the spectral evolution of sn  2002ap is about 1.5 times faster .",
    "the earliest available spectrum of sn  1997ef , on day @xmath156 , appears to have properties intermediate between the spectrum of sn  2002ap on day @xmath151 and that on day @xmath156 , judging from the progressive redshifting of line features .",
    "the near - maximum spectrum of sn  1997ef resembles that of sn  2002ap on day @xmath142 in all major features .",
    "the similarity between the spectrum of sn  1997ef on day @xmath1419 and that of sn  2002ap on day @xmath1415 is striking , both showing minor features of comparable intensities at about 4900 , 5900 , 6200 , 7100 and 7300  .",
    "most of the new features visible in the spectrum of sn  1997ef on day @xmath1452 , some of which are probably net emissions , are already visible in sn  2002ap on day @xmath1425 , although they are not as developed . both of these spectra suggest that the sne are making a transition to the nebular phase , while the spectrum of sn  1997ef on day @xmath1427 is still essentially photospheric in nature @xcite .    especially in the earliest spectra ,",
    "most features are so broad because of line blending that it is not easy to identify which lines contribute to them .",
    "thus we used the parameterized sn spectrum synthesis code synow , described by @xcite , to perform line identification and deduce velocity information .",
    "it is simpler and faster than the monte - carlo code of @xcite , and better suited for our objective , as it does not require the construction of realistic sn models . in this paper , the radial - dependent line optical depth above the photosphere",
    "is assumed to be proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the expansion velocity and @xmath18 is the photospheric velocity .",
    "a reasonable fit to the observations could be obtained using just a few ions : , , , , and , consistent with the line identification in sne  1997ef and 1998bw @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra and line identification for day @xmath157 and @xmath142 are shown in figure 2 .    either a high @xmath19 or a small @xmath20 can make the lines broad .",
    "guided by branch s ( 2001 ) work , we found that both are necessary to account for the extreme line widths .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , who used a monte - carlo code to synthesize some selected spectra of sn  2002ap .",
    "our best fit value of the power - law index was 3 for the first spectrum .",
    "this index value was used for the radial dependence of the opacity for all lines and at all epochs . as shown in figure 4 ,",
    "the photospheric velocity obtained from the fitting decrease from 35,000 @xmath21 on day @xmath22 to 13,000 @xmath23 on day @xmath142 , with the uncertainty being about 1000 @xmath21 empirically @xcite .",
    "our fits are reasonable for these epochs , allowing us to identify most absorption lines . however , some problems remain .",
    "one is the unwanted `` peak '' around 4100  , which is actually the remainder of continuum .",
    "we can remove it by introducing both and lines . however , there is no other argument for in sne  ic .",
    "such difficulties may show the limitations of synow .",
    "they are probably due to the assumption of a pure resonant scattering source function and on the simple power - law dependence of the optical depth on velocity applied to all ions .",
    "the hump around 5200   is also incorrectly reproduced , probably the consequence of not transferring sufficient flux from the blue ( @xmath24 ) in synow .",
    "finally , we introduced to fit the absorption around 5700  .",
    "@xmath25876 may also contributes there .",
    "the nir spectra show a significant feature , possibly due to @xmath210830 @xcite .",
    "that feature in sn  1994i might have been , , and/or lines . @xcite . among those absorption lines",
    "identified , the @xmath36347 , 6371 ( collectively called @xmath26355 ) absorption minimum was easily distinguishable during almost the entire observation period .",
    "therefore , we measured the minimum of the absorption as an alternative method of estimating the photospheric velocity . in figure 1",
    ", we marked with an arrow the minimum of the absorption .",
    "the evolution of the photospheric velocity , as deduced from this method , is also shown in figure 4 . at the earliest phases , the typical statistical error was around @xmath25 3000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , strong line blending makes the estimate of the velocity somewhat uncertain at those epochs . near maximum light , although the minima are clearly visible ( the statistical error was about @xmath25 1500 km s@xmath1 ) , the systematic error on the velocity is mostly due to the ambiguity introduced by the uncertain continuum . at late phases , the error ( around @xmath25 2500 km s@xmath1 )",
    "was mainly due to poor statistics .",
    "the difference between the velocities from and those from synow fitting may be mostly caused by systematic errors introduced by the uncertainty in the continuum and the heavy line blending .    in figure 4",
    ", we compare the evolution of the photospheric velocity of sn  2002ap , 1998bw and 1997ef @xcite .",
    "we adopted for sn  2002ap an explosion date of january 28.9 ut ( day @xmath159.2 ) , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the photospheric velocity of sn  2002ap declines faster than for the other two hypernovae , suggesting that the ejecta mass of sn  2002ap is smaller .",
    "although the velocity evolution of the three sne is initially well fitted with exponential functions , both sne  1997ef and 1998bw eventually seem to flatten out , sn  1998bw at about 7000 km s@xmath1 and sn  1997ef at about 2000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "while the measurement for sn  1998bw can be done directly on the spectra , the value for sn  1997ef is derived from model fitting , since , as for sn  2002ap , the line becomes indistinguishable at advanced epochs ( see spectra on day @xmath1452 for sn  1997ef and on day @xmath1425 for sn  2002ap in figure 3 ) .",
    "no sign of the flattening for sn  2002ap was seen over the period of our observations , but it might occur later , which may have to be established through detailed spectral modeling .",
    "the rapid evolution of the photospheric velocity and of the spectra of sn  2002ap suggests that sn  2002ap will develop a nebular spectrum earlier than the other hypernovae presented here . in sn  1997ef nebular emission was observed in the ir triplet on day @xmath1427 .",
    "our spectra of sn  2002ap unfortunately do not extend to that region .",
    "however , the spectrum on day @xmath1425 , which is intermediate between the day @xmath1427 and the day @xmath1452 spectra of sn  1997ef , may show the onset of weak [ ] @xmath36300 , 6364 net emission . e.  nishihara et al .",
    "( 2002 , in preparation ) show that a break occurs in the evolution of the ir colors around february 25 , suggesting the onset of nebular emission .",
    "the first spectra of sn  2002ap after solar conjunction , taken on day 131 and 140 , show that it has already entered the nebular phase @xcite .",
    "the broad spectral features , suggesting high kinetic energy , distinguish hypernovae from normal sne  ic .",
    "however , the observations of sn  2002ap suggest that there is a variety of hypernovae , based on the observational features ( spectra , spectral evolution , luminosity , light curves , the association with a grb , etc . ) .",
    "more observations of hypernovae are necessary in order to understand what physical parameters are responsible for the variations among hypernovae and whether there is a gap in properties between hypernovae and normal sne  ic ( figure 2 of nomoto et al .",
