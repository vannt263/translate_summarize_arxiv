    "the measurement of the proton struture function f@xmath2 at low q@xmath3 has been used recently by zeus @xcite to study the transition between photoproduction and deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the first measurement by zeus @xcite using 1995 data has now been followed by a higher precision measurement using dedicated detector components .",
    "a measurement of f@xmath2 has been made in the range 0.015 gev@xmath3 @xmath4 q@xmath3 @xmath4 0.65 gev@xmath3 and @xmath5 @xmath4 x @xmath4 @xmath7 , where q@xmath3 is the four - momentum transfer squared and x is the bjorken scaling variable .",
    "the measurement was made using 3.9 pb@xmath8 of data taken using special triggers in 1997 and , compared to the previous result , covers a larger kinematic region with improved accuracy .",
    "reconstruction of the scattered positron is performed using dedicated detector compontents : the beam pipe calorimeter ( bpc ) and the beam pipe tracker ( bpt ) of the zeus detector .",
    "the bpc is a small tungsten - scintillator sampling calorimeter that detects positrons scattered at angles of 18 - 32mrad with respect to the positron beam direction .",
    "it has an energy resolution of @xmath9 = 0.17@xmath10}$ ] .",
    "the bpt consisted of two silicon microstrip detectors .",
    "a track is reconstructed as the straight line between a hit on each detector and provides information on the positron scattering angle and impact point on the bpc .",
    "this helps eliminate background and reduce the systematic uncertainties .",
    "figure 1 shows f@xmath2 as a function of x in bins of q@xmath3 . down to q@xmath3@xmath111",
    "the data is well described by nlo qcd fits . the steep rise in f@xmath2 at low",
    "x observed at higher q@xmath3 persists down to the low q@xmath3 region .",
    "this rise though , becomes shallower as q@xmath3 decreases into the new region of measuremement . at low values of q@xmath3",
    "the data are well described by regge theory .",
    "the zeus collaboration has measured f@xmath2 in the region 0.015 gev@xmath3 @xmath4 q@xmath3 @xmath4 0.65 gev@xmath3 and @xmath5 @xmath4 x @xmath4 @xmath6 with high precision .",
    "the data can be used to examine the transition between perturbative and non - perturbative qcd ."
