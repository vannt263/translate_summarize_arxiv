    "brny uses this theorem combined with tverberg s theorem to give a bound on simplicial depth .",
    "his argument motivated the following question : how many colourful simplices , at least , contain @xmath6 in their convex hulls ?",
    "let @xmath14 denote the minimal number of colourful simplices containing @xmath6 in their convex hulls over all colourful point configurations @xmath1 in @xmath11 such that @xmath15 and @xmath9 for @xmath16 .",
    "the colourful carathodory theorem states that @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 has been investigated by  @xcite .",
    "they proved that @xmath18 and conjectured that @xmath19 .",
    "later @xcite proved that @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xcite proved that @xmath22 , and @xcite showed that @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite improved the bound to @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "this latter result was obtained using a combinatorial generalization of the colourful point configurations suggested by and known as _ octahedral systems _ , see  @xcite .",
    "we use this combinatorial approach to prove the conjecture .",
    "[ thm : maingeom ] the equality @xmath19 holds for every integer @xmath26 .",
    "the outline of the paper goes as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminary ] is divided into two parts .",
    "first we define the octahedral systems and show their link with the colourful point configurations .",
    "second , we introduce one of our main tools : the decomposition of an octahedral system over some elementary octahedral systems called umbrellas . section  [ sec : proof ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm : maingeom ] .",
    "let @xmath27 be @xmath28 pairwise disjoint finite sets , each of size at least @xmath29 .",
    "an _ octahedral system _ is a set @xmath30 satisfying the _ parity condition _ : the cardinality of @xmath31 is even if @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "we use the terminology of hypergraphs to describe an octahedral system : the sets @xmath35 are the _ classes _ , the elements in @xmath35 are the _ vertices _ , and the @xmath28-tuples in @xmath36 are the _",
    "edges_. an edge whose @xmath37th component is a vertex @xmath38 is _ incident with the vertex @xmath39 _ , and conversely .",
    "a vertex @xmath39 incident with no edges is _ isolated_. a class @xmath35 is _ covered _ if each vertex of @xmath35 is incident with at least one edge .",
    "finally , the set of edges incident with @xmath39 is denoted by @xmath40 and the _ degree of @xmath39 _ , denoted by @xmath41 , refers to @xmath42 .",
    "[ lem : nonempty ] in every nonempty octahedral system , at least one class is covered .",
    "consider an octahedral system @xmath30 .",
    "suppose that no classes are covered .",
    "there is at least one isolated vertex @xmath43 in each @xmath35 .",
    "hence , if there were an edge @xmath44 in @xmath45 , then the parity condition would not be satisfied for @xmath46 .    given a colourful point configuration @xmath1 , the octahedron lemma  @xcite states that , for any @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , the number of colourful simplices generated by @xmath49 and containing @xmath6 in their convex hulls is even .",
    "the hypergraph over @xmath36 where @xmath35 is identified with @xmath7 and whose edges are identified with the colourful simplices containing @xmath6 in their convex hulls is therefore an octahedral system .",
    "furthermore , a strengthening of the colourful theorem , given in  @xcite , states that if @xmath13 , then each point of the colourful point configuration is in some colourful simplices containing @xmath6 in their convex hulls .",
    "hence , in an octahedral system @xmath45 arising from such a colourful point configuration , each class @xmath35 is covered .",
    "the following proposition , proved in  @xcite , states that the set of all octahedral systems is stable under the `` symmetric difference '' operation .",
    "[ prop : stable ] let @xmath45 and @xmath50 be two octahedral systems over the same vertex set .",

    "let @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath53 is a subset of @xmath36 , we simply check that the parity condition is satisfied .",
    "consider @xmath54 with @xmath33 for @xmath55 .",
    "we have @xmath56 all the terms of the sum are even , which allows to conclude .",
    "we now present a family of specific octahedral systems we call _ umbrellas_. an umbrella @xmath57 is a set of the form @xmath58 , with @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the class @xmath35 covered in @xmath57 is called its _",

    "transversal_. an umbrella is clearly an octahedral system over @xmath36 and we have the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : propcol ] two umbrellas of the same colour have an edge in common if and only if they are equal .",
    "an umbrella is entirely determined by its colour @xmath35 and its transversal @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , if two umbrellas of the same colour have an edge in common , they necessarily have the same transversal , which implies that they are equal .",
    "it was implicitly proved in section 3 of  @xcite that any octahedral system can be described as a symmetric difference of umbrellas . in this paper , we describe an octahedral system as a symmetric difference of other octahedral systems to bound its cardinality .",
    "we now focus on octahedral systems where the size of each class is equal to the number of classes .",
    "consider a nonempty octahedral system @xmath30 with @xmath62 for all @xmath34 .",

    "furthermore , by definition of the symmetric difference , we have @xmath95 .",
    "this inclusion becomes @xmath96 . as two @xmath82",
    "s share no edges , @xmath97 and thus @xmath98 for all @xmath99 .",
    "we obtain @xmath100    finally to prove ( v ) it suffices to prove that a class @xmath35 not covered in @xmath45 remains not covered in @xmath72 .",

    "therefore , the umbrellas in @xmath68 , which are defined by the edges incident with @xmath69 , contain no edges incident with @xmath39 .",
    "hence , @xmath39 is isolated in @xmath70 and in @xmath45 .",
    "finally , @xmath39 remains isolated in @xmath72 .",
    "unlike the suitable decomposition of @xmath45 , which is a decomposition over general octahedral systems , the decomposition given in the following lemma is over umbrellas .",

    "for @xmath71 in @xmath135 , we have @xmath149 , note that here the degree is counted in @xmath145 .",
    "the fact that the umbrellas in @xmath68 are disjoint proves the first equality .",
    "the second equality is deduced from the facts that @xmath71 has at most one edge in common with each umbrella in @xmath68 , the one incident with @xmath73 , and that @xmath71 has no neighbours in @xmath135 .",

    "the number of links in @xmath148 incident with @xmath154 is then at most @xmath161 .",
