    "discharges are nonequilibrium ionization processes occurring in initially non - ionized matter exposed to strong electric fields .",
    "depending on the spatio - temporal characteristics of the electric field and on the ionization and charge transport properties of the medium , discharges can assume many different modes of appearance .",
    "in particular in gases under approximately normal conditions one distinguishes phenomenologically between stationary modes like arc , glow or dark discharges and transient phenomena like leaders , the initial stages of sparks , and streamers @xcite , which occur e.g. in silent discharges @xcite .",
    "the latter nonstationary discharges often form the initial state of a discharge that later on becomes stationary .",
    "we will focus here on an essential element of many transient discharge phenomena , the initial field - driven ionization wave .",
    "the conceptually simplest problem of this kind has become known as the streamer problem in a non - attaching gas .",
    "it treats the dynamics of the free electrons and positive ions in a homogeneous gas at rest taking the following mechanisms into account : _ (",
    "i ) _ impact ionization , the process in which a free electron accelerated in a strong local field ionizes a neutral molecule , generating a new free electron and a positive ion ; _ ( ii ) _ drift and diffusion of charged particles , in particular of the electrons whose mobility is much larger than that of the ions ; _ ( iii ) _ the coupling of the electric field to the charges through the poisson equation of electrostatics .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite of a basic model incorporating these physical ingredients for parameter values appropriate for nitrogen under normal conditions reveal that a streamer consists of a sharp nonlinear ionization front which propagates into a non - ionized gas , leaving a weakly ionized nonequilibrium plasma behind .",
    "the underlying mechanism is that in the leading edge of the front the electrons are accelerated by the large imposed electric field ; this causes the build - up of an electron avalanche due to impact ionization .",
    "the generated free charges eventually screen the field and thus suppress further ionization .",
    "it is the nonlinear balance between these two nonequilibrium processes , namely the ionization avalanche and the electric screening , which determines the dynamics of the ionization front and the state of the plasma behind it . in confined geometries ,",
    "streamers usually have a nontrivial fingerlike shape , as is illustrated by the snapshots in fig .  1 of streamer dynamics taken from the simulations of vitello _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite . as the sharpness of the electron density profiles in fig .",
    "1 illustrates , the `` passive body '' of the finger is separated from the external non - ionized gas by a very narrow region  of width of order microns  in which essentially all the action is occurring .",
    "this width has to be compared to the size of the filament , which is of order millimeters .",
    "it is in this narrow layer that most of the ionization process is taking place . in this same region , there is a nonzero charge density , and consequently , also a very large electric field gradient .",
    "these features indicate that there are two different spatial scales in this process , an `` inner '' scale associated with the thickness of the zone where the ionization takes place , and an `` outer '' one where the spatial variations are set by the size of the finger and the external experimental geometry .",
    "it is precisely for these reasons that accurate simulations are extremely demanding and that they were accomplished only recently by dhali and williams @xcite and by vitello _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a separation of scales is strongly reminiscent of what occurs in combustion fronts @xcite .",
    "a combustion front is a narrow layer of thickness @xmath7 to which the combustion is essentially confined , while outside of it , the temperature field varies on a much longer scale @xmath8 .",
    "physically , such sharp combustion fronts occur in the limit when the chemical reaction rates involved in the combustion are very fast once a sufficient temperature is reached .",
    "it has been shown that , on the basis of an asymptotic expansion to lowest order in the small parameter @xmath9 using matched asymptotic expansions @xcite , the problem can be analyzed in terms of the propagation of an `` effective interface '' .",
    "more specifically , one first solves the so - called inner problem of a locally _ almost planar _ reaction zone .",
    "this permits to relate the temperature and chemical composition fields on both sides of the front ( at distances @xmath10 such that @xmath11 ) and to determine the local front velocity as a function of local curvature and fields . on the scale of the remaining outer problem",
    ", these relations then play the role of boundary conditions and of a kinetic equation for the effective moving interface of zero thickness . besides in combustion ,",
    "the technique of asymptotic matching to obtain an effective interface description has also been applied to chemical waves @xcite , thermal plumes @xcite and to phase field models of solidification @xcite .    in spite of some important differences between combustion and streamer fronts",
    "as discussed in the appendix , a similar approach appears possible for streamers .",
    "as discussed also in @xcite , building on such a reduced description of streamer dynamics appears very desirable , not only because it might make numerical studies much easier , but also because it will allow us to draw upon the knowledge and methods which have been developed in the last decade in the field of interfacial pattern formation and dynamics @xcite .",
    "the first step towards this goal is to determine the field dependence of the velocity and the ionization and charge profile of a planar front which propagates into the non - ionized region .",
    "we thus analyze in this paper the inner problem for a planar streamer front .",
    "this allows us to reduce the problem to effectively one dimension .",
    "our analysis clearly identifies the problem of streamer front propagation as an example of front propagation into unstable states .",
    "physically , the instability of the non - ionized gas against charge fluctuations can be traced back to the fact that any small electron density gets amplified by the impact ionization . as is standard for front propagation into unstable states @xcite , we find that the one - dimensional streamer equations exhibit a one - parameter family of uniformly translating front solutions , parametrized by their velocity . as usual @xcite",
    ", the question is then to decide which of these front solutions is the dynamically selected one , i.e. , is the one reached at long times after a localized ionized region has been created by some initial ionization event",
    ". the existing knowledge of front propagation into unstable states @xcite provides us with an educated guess for the selected velocity , which we confirm with the help of numerical studies .",
    "taken together , our results provide an essentially complete solution of the inner problem of planar streamer fronts .    in itself ,",
    "the idea to analyze the planar fronts of a streamer model is not new  we refer to @xcite for earlier work .",
    "apart from the fact , that the authors from the seventies @xcite investigate different models , which are more inspired by equilibrium concepts ( e.g. , the ionization behind the front is determined by thermal ionization , where the electron temperature is raised by application of strong electric fields ) , our work casts new light on this old problem from two different angles : + first of all , it was empirically noted , that the standard approach to analyze uniformly translating fronts , failed to determine a unique propagation velocity , given the field and the gas parameters . turcotte and ong @xcite clearly state this failure of their theory ( this `` great defect '' of their theory is recalled in fowler",
    "s reviews @xcite ) and suggest , that a unique solution might be determined by a dynamical stability analysis . albright and tidman @xcite then perform such a stability analysis , but not in a systematic way , and they draw incorrect conclusions . dyakonov and kachorovskii @xcite also find the indeterminacy of the speed of uniformly translating planar fronts , now for an approximated version of our model , and propose to solve this by using the tip radius of the streamer finger as an extra length scale , which they , however , can not determine .",
    "we , in contrast , trace the indeterminacy of the velocity from the analysis of uniformly translating streamer front solutions to the fact , that this is an example of front propagation into unstable states . applying the concepts explained above , we solve the selection problem for planar fronts without additional assumptions or approximations .",
    "we argue that a particular front solution out of a whole family of dynamically stable solutions is selected , because it is the only one compatible with the initial condition of a localized ionization seed .",
    "+ secondly , this result is the first _ ingredient _ for studying the formation of patterns , in particular of the tip radius  we do not attempt to model _ global features of the pattern formation _ with our planar front analysis .",
    "our approach thus is very different in spirit to the earlier investigations : as also stressed in @xcite , in an effective interface description based on a matched asymptotic expansion , the results of weakly curved , almost planar fronts are essentially used _ locally _ everywhere in the interface region : they enter the analysis on the outer scale as boundary conditions at the moving interface .",
    "it is on this outer scale that pattern formation problems like the size , velocity and shape of the streamer should be analyzed .",
    "once our results on planar fronts will be extended to weakly curved fronts , all the necessary ingredients to tackle these questions appear to be available .",
    "the main results of our present analysis of the streamer equations used in the simulations @xcite can be summarized as follows :    _ ( a ) _ dimensional analysis shows that in dimensionless units , a single parameter remains to characterize the gas , the dimensionless electron diffusion coefficient @xmath2 characteristic of the gas [ see eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 8 ] ) ] . for gases under normal conditions , @xmath2 is small , of order 0.1 - 0.3 .",
    "_ ( b ) _ the length scale set by the electron impact ionization coefficient [ the coefficient @xmath12 in eq .",

    "the thickness @xmath7 of the charged layer is on the order of this same ionization length for _ negatively charged streamer fronts _ _ ( nsf ) _",
    "given that typical streamer diameters found in the simulations are of the order of @xmath13 mm , @xmath14 is at most of order @xmath15 ; this justifies an effective interface description of streamer dynamics .    _",
    "( c ) _ we find that electron diffusion acts as a singular perturbation for _ positively charged streamer fronts ( psf ) _ : without diffusion , such fronts can not propagate , but with any nonzero @xmath2 , they do . as a result ,",
    "the behavior is singular in the limit @xmath16 : for @xmath17 , the thickness @xmath7 is again of order of the ionization length , but for @xmath18 the electron density and its gradients diverge due to the appearance of another smaller length scale ( of order @xmath19 ) .    _",
    "( d ) _ the electron density generated by the propagating front is again basically set by dimensional analysis for _",
    "nsf_. we calculate for @xmath20 the dependence of the dimensionless electron density @xmath21 behind the front on the electric field @xmath22 far ahead of our planar front .",
    "our results compare favorably with those extracted from the simulations @xcite , according to the prescriptions of the theory of matched asymptotic expansions @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath22 is _ not _ the field value at the electrode position , but the value obtained by extrapolating the slowly varying outer field to the front position .",
    "we also calculate the full @xmath2 and @xmath22 dependence of the electron density @xmath21 behind the front of _ psf _ for @xmath20 .    _",
    "( e ) _ the dynamically relevant ( `` selected '' ) front velocity @xmath23 is a unique function of @xmath22 and @xmath2 .",

    "we note , however , that the equations for planar streamer fronts [ eqs .",

    "_ @xcite and fisher @xcite ; at the same time , however , they are sufficiently more complicated that they appear to present new challenges from a mathematical point of view .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic equations for streamer formation , and perform a dimensional analysis for the inner problem of streamer fronts . in section iii , we discuss the stability of the basic homogeneous states of interest , the homogeneous non - ionized state and the homogeneous weakly ionized state .",
    "we also discuss the physical mechanism of streamer formation and the proper initial and boundary conditions to study these in the case of planar fronts , which allow us to simplify the equations describing planar front dynamics . in section",
    "iv we demonstrate that there exists a one - parameter family of uniformly translating fronts characterized by a continuous range of front velocities @xmath30 .",
    "we also briefly show how in the case @xmath31 , the equations for uniformly translating fronts can be solved analytically .",
    "these solutions , which turn out to be useful as a small-@xmath2 approximation for @xmath24 , yield an explicit expression for the electron density @xmath21 behind the @xmath24 in terms of the field @xmath22 just ahead of it .",

    "application of these concepts allows us to predict the shape and velocity of the dynamically relevant front solution ( the selected front ) and the value of the electron density generated behind it .",
    "this yields the various selection results for @xmath24 and for @xmath25 , summarized in points _ ( c)-(g ) _ above , and leads us to predict that the behavior of @xmath25 in the limit @xmath18 is singular .",

    "we finally reflect on our results and on the future steps to be taken to arrive at an effective interface description of streamer dynamics . in an appendix",
    "we discuss differences and similarities between combustion and streamer fronts .",

    "( [ 2013 ] ) , means that all magnetic fields as well as terms in the maxwell equations associated with time - dependences of the fields , are neglected @xcite .    the electron particle current density @xmath40 is approximated in ( [ 2014 ] ) as the sum of a drift and a diffusion term .",
    "note that this diffusion approximation implies that the electron mean free path must be small with respect to the scale of variation @xmath7 of the electric field .",
    "this condition is just about satisfied for the parameter values taken for @xmath45 in the simulations , except possibly at the highest field values ( see also the discussion in the concluding section vii ) .",
    "the electron drift velocity is taken to be linear in the field @xmath36 , with @xmath46 the ( positive ) electron mobility .",
    "the electron diffusion coefficient @xmath47 and the mobility @xmath46 are treated here as independent coefficients , since they effectively depend on the field strength @xcite ( only in the low - field limit are they related by the einstein relation ) .",
    "more generally , the diffusion coefficient should be replaced by a diffusion tensor , which is diagonal in a reference frame with one axis along the electric field .",
    "its longitudinal component , the only relevant one for planar fronts perpendicular to @xmath48 , is somewhat smaller than the transverse one . since we will see , that n@xmath33 reaches a typical degree of ionization of only @xmath49 , density fluctuations of the non - ionized gas can be neglected and the mean free path of the electrons and therefore @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be taken as independent of the degree of ionization .",
    "the ionic current is neglected according to eq .",
    "( [ 2005 ] ) , since the mobility of ions is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the electrons @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the analysis of the inner scale , that we will perform in the present paper , @xmath41 is negligible .    the @xmath50 ( [ 2006 ] ) finally accounts for the creation of free charges by impact ionization .",
    "if the product of electric field @xmath51 and electronic mean free path @xmath52 is large enough , free electrons can gain sufficient kinetic energy to ionize neutral molecules .",
    "accordingly there is a threshold field @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 the probability that a scattering event carries at least the ionization energy is large .",
    "the effective ionization cross - section @xmath55 then essentially saturates , while for @xmath56 the ionization rate per scattering event is largely suppressed .",
    "the @xmath50-term is given by the ionization rate , which can be calculated as the product of the drift current of free electrons @xmath57 times the target particle density @xmath58 of the neutral gas times the effective ionization cross - section @xmath55 .",
    "commonly , a phenomenological ionization coefficient @xmath59 is used , ( which clearly has dimension of inverse length , ) whose field threshold behavior in the townsend approximation @xmath60 @xcite is expressed by eq .",
    "( [ 2006 ] ) . as discussed by raizer @xcite , in the approximation that every collision is ionizing , if the electron carries an energy larger than the ionization energy @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 since in much of our analysis the specific form of @xmath63 is not needed , we will use a slightly more general formulation in eq .",
    "( [ 2022 ] ) below .    in the @xmath50-term , ionization due to the photons also created in recombination or scattering events , is neglected .",
    "this is motivated by the ionization cross - sections due to photons being much smaller than those due to electrons .",
    "note that , if photo - ionization is taken into account , the dynamical equations become nonlocal .    no sink term needs to be included for the analysis of the inner problem , since the recombination length at a degree of ionization of order @xmath49 that we will derive below is very large as compared with the front width @xmath7 .",
    "( for this reason , the inner problem is the same for streamers and leaders @xcite : the difference between these discharge modes , which consists in the fact that recombination is non - negligible in the plasma body of leaders , would come into play only when solving , at a later stage , the outer problem . )",
    "the fact that the degree of ionization remains small is also the reason that saturation effects are neglected in ( [ 2006 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the situation in n@xmath33 , that is described by our model equations , in attaching gases like o@xmath33 , a third charged species plays a role , namely negative ions formed by a neutral molecule catching a free electron . for a description of the physics of such attaching gases and simulations thereof , see , e.g. , @xcite .    the equations above are deterministic .",
    "thermal fluctuations in fact can be neglected , since even an unphysically small ionization energy of 3 ev leads to a boltzmann factor of @xmath64 at room temperature .",
    "also other stochastic effects are not accounted for in the simulations we compare to .",
    "we further discuss possible stochastic effects in the experiments in the conclusion .",
    "finally , the dynamical system ( [ 2011])-([2006 ] ) must be complemented by :    _ ( i ) _ boundary conditions : as will be discussed in detail in section iii , for the problem of front propagation , these are specified by the value @xmath22 of the electric field far ahead of the front , where the total charge density vanishes .    _",
    "( ii ) _ initial conditions : we ignore the details of the plasma nucleation event ( e.g. triggering by radiation from an external source ) , and assume that at @xmath65 a small well - localized ionization seed is present .",
    "the precise meaning , for our problem , of `` well - localized '' will be made clear in section v.      in order to identify the physical scales and intrinsic parameters of our problem , we reduce eqs .",
    "( [ 2011])-([2006 ] ) to a dimensionless form .",
    "the most natural scale of length and electric field are the ionization length @xmath66 and the threshold field @xmath67 of the ionization rate ( [ 2006 ] ) .",
    "the velocity scale is then the electron drift velocity at this field strength , @xmath68 , leading to a time unit @xmath69 , and a charge unit @xmath70 .    for concreteness",

    "we believe that typical values are generally in the range 0.1 - 0.3 , since in the approximation ( [ mfp ] ) , @xmath82 and since the ratio @xmath83 appears to be commonly of the order of volts for large fields , while @xmath61 is typically of the order of several electron volts .",
    "we are now able , solely on the basis of the dimensional analysis above , to make a first semi - quantitative prediction about streamers .",
    "we will in practice be interested in external fields @xmath84 ( for @xmath85 and @xmath12 on the order of micrometers , the electron avalanche process becomes much too ineffective for streamer fronts to develop at reasonably small distances ; also our scale separation approach discussed in the introduction might break down ) .",
    "we can therefore expect that , for @xmath2 values @xmath86 , as is the case for n@xmath33 , front widths will be of order @xmath12 , and that in addition the reduced electron density @xmath21 far behind the front on the inner scale will be of order unity as well .",
    "this leads one to expect electron densities in the streamer body on the order of @xmath87 @xmath88 , in agreement with numerical findings .",
    "the first task , when studying in general the propagation of a front , is to identify the nature and stability of the states which the front connects .",
    "we expect the invading state , here the ionized one created by the front , to be stable @xcite , while the invaded state can in general either be metastable or unstable .",
    "physically , we of course expect the non - ionized state to be unstable in a non - vanishing field in the present model .",
    "( in an attaching gas forming also negative ions , it is conceivable that the non - ionized state is metastable for not too strong fields . )",
    "equations ( [ 2022])-([2025 ] ) immediately yield , that stationary homogeneous states simply are solutions of @xmath89 so , these stationary states decompose into two families :    _ ( i ) _ non - ionized states , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 arbitrary : since the density of free electrons vanishes , no ionization can occur , whatever the value of @xmath91 is . if also the density of ions vanishes , @xmath92 .",

    "the real part @xmath110 , the sign of which determines whether fluctuations decay or are amplified , contains a destabilizing term , expressing that any small electron density fluctuation is amplified at rate @xmath111 , and a stabilizing term , due to the diffusive spreading of electron charges . for @xmath112 , @xmath113 : non - ionized states are unstable against long - wavelength perturbations .",
    "we note , that the single fourier eigenmodes ( [ 2 - 16 ] ) violate individually the physical constraint that @xmath114 be positive everywhere .",
    "but eq .  (",
    "[ 2 - 17 ] ) also determines the time evolution of physically allowed fluctuations ( wavepackets ) that are superpositions of these eigenmodes .",
    "for example , one easily deduces from it lozanski s expression @xcite for the time - evolution of a gaussian - shaped small electron density with arbitrary constants @xmath115 , @xmath116 as long as linearization around the non - ionized state holds .",
    "as expected , the center of the spreading packet drifts with velocity @xmath117 , while the total number of electrons it contains is amplified at rate @xmath111 and the wave - packet stays gaussian , with time - dependent width @xmath118 .",
    "such ionization modes derived by linearizing around the non - ionized state are known as electron or ionization avalanches in the gas discharge literature .",
    "we now perform the same linear stability analysis for the completely screened states @xmath119 .",
    "the fact that @xmath120 from eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 17a ] ) assures that the linear perturbations are not affected by ionization ; the dynamics thus evolves with conserved particle densities .",
    "again , due to the existence of a continuous family of screened stationary states , parametrized by @xmath21 , the spectrum contains a branch of @xmath121 modes . for the nontrivial branch",

    "equation ( [ 2 - 19 ] ) expresses the fact that the completely screened ( @xmath94 ) states are stable , the decay of perturbations being due to the added stabilizing effects of overdamped plasmons @xmath125 and electron diffusion . the @xmath126 limit of the plasmon mode leads to dielectric screening @xcite .",
    "let us now investigate the dynamical evolution of an initial state in which the electron and ion densities vanish everywhere except in a small localized region .",
    "an example of such localized initial conditions is an initially gaussian electron density , as in the simulations @xcite  under what circumstances initial conditions are sufficiently localized will become clear later .",

    ", both densities will grow due to impact ionization . if this were the only mechanism , the space charge would remain unchanged and the ionization would continue indefinitely . however , the electrons are mobile , and at the same time they start to drift in the direction opposite to the electric field @xmath127 .",
    "if we neglect for the moment the diffusion , this drift has two effects : first of all , the electrons start to drift in the direction of the anode .",
    "impact ionization then starts in previously non - ionized regions as well , so the ionized region expands towards the anode . secondly , as the electrons drift while the ions stay put ( on the fast time scale ) , a charge separation occurs which tends to suppress the field strength in the ionized region .",
    "when the size of the initial perturbation and/or the time during which the avalanche has built up are large enough , the screening of the field becomes almost complete in the ionized region so that ionization stops there .",
    "the behavior in this region can be described by linearizing around the screened state as done above .",
    "after an electrically screened body of the ionized region has developed , the initial ionization avalanche is said to have developed into a streamer .",
    "thus streamer fronts are strongly nonlinear and determined by two competing mechanisms , which dynamically balance each other : the ionization process which is strongest at the leading edge and the screening of the field due to the free charges which increases towards the rear end of the front .",
    "this balance also explains our finding that the ionization length and the screening length in the plasma behind the @xmath24 are of the same order of magnitude for field values that are not too small .",
    "technically speaking , the challenge in constructing the full front is to connect the two regimes linearized about the homogeneous states in an appropriate way through the nonlinear regime of the front .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have neglected electron diffusion . in this case the @xmath24 propagates towards the anode with a velocity that is at least the drift velocity of the electrons in the local electric field .",
    "the @xmath25 , in contrast , is moving in the direction _",
    "opposite _ to the drift of the only mobile species , the electrons .",
    "its space charge is formed by the ions staying put , while the electrons are drawn into the ionized body .",
    "propagation of a @xmath25 is therefore only possible if the electron diffusion current overcompensates the drift current .",
    "this in turn implies that if the diffusion coefficient @xmath2 is small , electron density gradients must be extremely steep . from this discussion",
    "it already becomes evident  and we will derive this below  that for an @xmath24 , diffusion is a small correction for @xmath128 , since drift and diffusion currents are acting in parallel directions . in @xmath25",
    ", however , diffusion has to overcome the drift , and as a result in this case the limit of vanishing diffusion is very singular .",
    "we will see in section iv that this manifests itself through the emergence of a new inner length scale @xmath129 , the diffusion length associated with the electron drift velocity .",
    "of course , a charged front only screens the normal component of the electric field .",
    "this is why electric screening is efficient in the head of the streamer , while the field penetrates in the body of a single streamer in the simulations @xcite .",
    "our planar front analysis thus serves as a first approximation for the mechanisms in the moving tip of the streamer finger .",
    "let us now restrict our analysis to the case of plane fronts perpendicular to a constant electric field .",
    "of course , in practice planar streamer fronts will be unstable to deformations along the front ( very much like in the mullins - sekerka instability in crystal growth @xcite ) , but as explained in the introduction , the planar front analysis is a first step towards understanding the dynamics on the inner length scale @xmath12 and time scale @xmath130 . as such , it is the first basic ingredient for deriving an effective interface model on scales @xmath131 .",
    "we choose the @xmath132 axis as parallel to the field and perpendicular to the planar front so that @xmath133 and @xmath134 . from the point of view of matched asymptotic expansions , the electric field in the non - ionized region",
    "before the front will vary adiabatically slowly on the `` inner '' time scale @xmath135 of the front , the timescale on which the front propagates over a distance comparable to its width , because the length scales of the outer problem determining the changes of @xmath48 are assumed to be much larger than the inner scale @xmath12 . for our study of the inner problem , we thus take the asymptotic field value @xmath102 in the unionized region constant in time .",
    "furthermore , we will use the convention that the unionized initial state into which the front propagates is at the right towards large positive values of @xmath132 , so that there @xmath136 which motivates now the use of the superscript + .",
    "we emphasize again that `` @xmath137 '' should be interpreted on the length scale @xmath12 of the inner problem in the sense of matched asymptotic expansions @xcite .",
    "far behind the front , i.e. , for @xmath138 , the discussion of section ii leads us to expect a homogeneous stable state @xmath139 which value @xmath21 will be dynamically selected and what the corresponding front velocity and profile are , for a given fixed value of the electric field @xmath22 before the front , is the selection problem , we aim to solve .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ 304 ] ) allows an important simplification of the equations in one dimension : if we insert ( [ 2024 ] ) into ( [ 2023 ] ) , we obtain @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an arbitrary function of time which is constant in space . in view of the boundary condition ( [ 304 ] ) , @xmath141 vanishes at @xmath142 and thus everywhere . for planar fronts , the model eqs .",

    "( [ 308 ] ) implies that the field decays behind the front , if no strong density gradients act against it . as we shall see later when we will discuss our simulation results in section vi , such strong density gradients often occur during the transient regime before a @xmath25 emerges",
    "once , however , a front has approached an approximately uniformly translating state , the electron density @xmath21 behind the front is almost homogeneous and the field behind the front then decays to zero on a time scale @xmath145 according to ( [ 308 ] ) .",
    "note , that the local decay of the field for any nonzero electron density is due to electrodynamics of conserved quantities that continues also after the impact ionization has been suppressed .",
    "we finally note that in the limit where the diffusion is small ( @xmath146 ) , it is easy to identify the crossover time from the linear avalanche regime to that of streamer propagation in the case that the initial electron density is small and nonzero only in a very narrow localized region .",
    "as explained in the beginning of this section , in the avalanche regime we can neglect the changes in the background field @xmath22 due to the build - up of the charges .",
    "the evolution of the electron density is then described by the linearized version of ( [ 307 ] ) , a linear equation with drift , diffusion and growth .",
    "hence , if the initial electron density is , e.g. , gaussian , the electron density will according to ( [ 2034 ] ) remain a gaussian profile , whose maximum drifts with a velocity @xmath147 in the direction opposite to the field and whose amplitude grows exponentially as @xmath148 .",
    "in other words , if the total initial electron charge is @xmath149 , then the total number of electrons in this avalanche regime grows as @xmath150 .",
    "likewise , the total ion charge grows exponentially , but if both the diffusion constant and the width and amplitude of the initial perturbation are small , the electron drift will separate the negative electron charge and the positive ion charge almost completely .",
    "the crossover to the nonlinear streamer regime will therefore occur when the total charge in the positively and negatively charged regions is big enough that screening of the field becomes appreciable , i.e. , at a time @xmath151 when @xmath152~.\\ ] ]",
    "above we already have introduced the idea , that fronts asymptotically approach some shape , which is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "this is based on our experience @xcite with other examples of front propagation into unstable states that the front will acquire some asymptotic shape and velocity in the long time limit , which will be the same ( `` universal '' ) for a large class of `` sufficiently localized '' initial conditions that comprise most physically relevant initial states .",
    "this property is often referred to as the front selection problem .",
    "our subsequent analysis will therefore follow the usual strategy in examples of this type : we will first show in this section that there generally is a one - parameter family of front solutions . in section",
    "v we then summarize our present understanding of the front selection problem , and on the basis of this predict the properties of the selected streamer front .",
    "the numerical simulations that confirm our predictions are presented in section vi .    uniformly translating fronts with velocity @xmath30 are stationary in a coordinate system moving with velocity @xmath30 .",

    "these results answer the question of whether @xmath25 do or do not propagate , while explaining why the simulations of vitello _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite could not yield a definite answer  most probably , because , although their total width is of order @xmath12 , their true inner length scale , as defined by the steepness of the profile , was too small to be resolved by their grid size .",
    "( note that the apparent symmetry between @xmath25 and @xmath24 found in earlier simulations @xcite is to be related to the fact that there propagation into a pre - ionized medium ( with initial electron density of @xmath409 ) is studied , and possibly also due to the use of a poorly resolving grid . )    it was observed empirically by dhali and williams @xcite that in the three - dimensional simulations , the dielectric relaxation time in the plasma behind the front was of the same order as the intrinsic time scale set by the front motion .",
    "our analysis shows , that this was no accident : it is a manifestation of the fact that the balance of the growth mechanism ( impact ionization ) and the stabilization mechanism ( screening ) leads to a single time scale @xmath69 for a @xmath24 and for the relaxation behind it for fields of order @xmath67 .",
    "since our dimensionless value of @xmath21 is the inverse dielectric relaxation time , it is of order unity ( or slightly smaller ) for fields @xmath410 .    of course",
    ", the above results should only be considered as a first step towards a realistic treatment of streamer propagation .",
    "they will have to be developed and extended along two different directions :    _ ( i ) _ _ predictions of patterns within the present model and comparison with the simulations : _ within the frame of the present continuous and fully deterministic model , we here have only considered the restricted case of a one - dimensional geometry .",
    "this enabled us to demonstrate that the concept of effective interfaces does apply to streamers .",
    "this approach will now have to be extended to the description of curved fronts . as also discussed in @xcite , one",
    "will then be equiped with a reduced formulation , valid on the outer scale , which will permit us to study real three - dimensional streamers as pattern - forming systems , as was done , e.g. , for viscous fingers and dendritic solidification fronts @xcite .",
    "this should provide a direct approach to the question of dielectric patterns , alternative to the phenomenological @xmath411-inspired dielectric breakdown models @xcite .    _",
    "( ii ) _ _ possibly , extensions of the model will be necessary to predict real experiments : _ we have based our analysis on the minimal model as defined in section ii .",
    "it contains several restricting simplifications . a first step in the improvement of",
    "the model would be to include the field dependence of the transport coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that this will not modify our qualitative analysis , as , e.g. , the counting argument for the existence of front solutions in section iv depends only on the linearization about the stable and unstable states .",
    "moreover , the qualitative asymmetry between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 will persist as these result from the asymmetry of the electron drift .",
    "quantitatively , the value of @xmath27 , the selected value of @xmath24 , will simply be given by ( [ w1 ] ) with the transport coefficient and ionization rate evaluated at the field value @xmath22 .",
    "the slow transient build - up and small speed of @xmath25 could be affected quantitatively by ionic motion , but from this effect , we expect no major qualitative differences .",
    "+ finally , it should be kept in mind that our continuum equations are only valid on length scales larger than the mean free path @xmath52 . on the other hand",
    ", we find for the strongest field values appearing in the simulations ( which are much larger than the values of the field across the gap , due to the enhancement near the streamer tip ) , that the front width decreases down to about @xmath412 in the approximation ( [ mfp ] ) .",
    "in such limits , nonlocality of the transport and ionization effects begin to play a role . in addition , under these conditions , a typical volume of size @xmath413 contains only of the order of 1000 electrons for the parameter values ( [ 2026 ] ) used in the simulations .",
    "fluctuations are then likely to become non - negligible . in principle , treating these effects calls for a full kinetic description .",
    "this is probably out of reach for the moment , but one might want to mimic the main features of these effects by introducing stochastic terms in the equations .",
    "these also could mimic photo - ionization somewhat before the front due to photons released in the impact ionization events , or the natural homogeneous background ionization due to radioactivity and cosmic radiation .",
    "investigation of their relevance for branching of dielectric breakdown patterns might help to understand the asymmetry between the macroscopic patterns of discharges propagating into a positive or a negative field @xcite .    in conclusion",

    "vitello for making copies of figures from @xcite available , which appear here as fig .  1 .",
    "in the introduction , we draw on the similarity between the streamer problem and other problems like combustion , chemical waves , thermal plumes , phase field models , _ etc . _ , to motivate the development of an effective interface approach . of these problems ,",
    "streamer propagation is most closely analogous to combustion , in that the strong nonlinearity of the reaction rates ( the combustion rate and the ionization rate ) is an important factor in giving rise to front development in flames and streamers , respectively .",
    "there are important differences as well , however , and since several interface techniques were originally developed in the context of combustion@xcite , we highlight some of the differences and similarities here :    _ ( a ) _ in combustion the reaction rate depends strongly on the temperature , whose outer dynamics is governed by a diffusion equation of the form @xmath414 , while for streamers the ionization rate depends strongly on the field @xmath415 , with @xmath416 the _ gradient _ of the potential @xmath417 that obeys the laplace equation @xmath418 in the outer region where the total charge density vanishes .",
    "this field strength @xmath91 varies strongly in the streamer front , since the increased screening resulting from the rising electron density suppresses @xmath91  and hence the ionization rate  to zero . in combustion , on the other hand , the temperature hardly varies throughout the combustion zone .",
    "_ ( b ) _ combustion fronts are essentially fronts progating into a metastable state , because the front has to supply the heat that increases the temperature and hence the reaction rate , while streamer front propagation is an example of front propagation into unstable states , where the reaction starts for any nonvanishing electron density .    _",
    "( c ) _ in a flame front typically the temperature remains high enough that all the reactions proceed to saturation : all the combustable material burns .",
    "the temperature difference between the flame front and the background is then essentially determined by conservation ( conversion ) of energy . in typical streamer fronts , on the other hand , the field @xmath91 is suppressed long before saturation effects start to play a role , and hence the ionization level behind the front is set by the internal dynamics of the front rather than by conservation laws ( i.e. , the gas density ) .      _ ( e ) _ finally , the relevant asymptotic expansion for streamers is not quite like the `` activation energy asymptotics '' of combustion @xcite , since we consider here fields strengths that are comparable to the characteristic field scale @xmath67 of the ionization rate given in eq .",
    "( [ 2006 ] ) before the front , whereas in combustion activation energy asymptotics is often appropriate since the flame temperature remains much smaller than the chemical activation energy . for streamers ,",
    "an analysis like activation energy asymptotics is appropriate in the limit of small fields @xmath420 .",
    "of course , in streamers the rapid variation of the field @xmath91 in the front region , and hence the rapid suppression of the ionization rate , looks , at first sight , similar to the suppression of the chemical reaction rate with decreasing temperature in flames .",
    "however , in flames this is due to the strongly nonlinear dependence of the reaction rate on temperature before the front , ( so that a slight suppression of the temperature reduces the reaction rate dramatically ) , while in streamers in large external fields of order @xmath67 this is due to the fact that the field itself is reduced significantly behind the streamer front , as a result of screening .",

    "<S> streamers are a mode of dielectric breakdown of a gas in a strong electric field : a sharp nonlinear ionization wave propagates into a non - ionized gas , leaving a nonequilibrium plasma behind . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization avalanche in the tip of the wave is due to free electrons being accelerated in the strong field and ionizing the gas by impact . </S>",
    "<S> this chain reaction deeper in the wave is suppressed by the generated free charges screening the field . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of streamers show two widely separated spatial scales : the width of the charged layer where the electron density gradients and the ionization rate are very large ( @xmath0 m ) ) , and the width of the electrically screened , finger - shaped and ionized region ( @xmath1(mm ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus recently have suggested to analyze first the properties of the charge - ionization - layer on the inner scale on which it is almost planar , and then to understand the streamer shape on the outer scale as the motion of an effective interface as is done in other examples of nonequilibrium pattern formation . </S>",
    "<S> the first step thus is the analysis of the inner dynamics of planar streamer fronts . for these </S>",
    "<S> , we resolve the long - standing question about what determines the front speed , by applying the modern insights of pattern formation to the streamer equations used in the recent simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these include field - driven impact ionization , electron drift and diffusion and the poisson equation for the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> first , in appropriately chosen dimensionless units only one parameter remains to characterize the gas , the dimensionless electron diffusion constant @xmath2 ; for typical gases under normal conditions @xmath3 - 0.3 . </S>",
    "<S> then we determine essentially all relevant properties of planar streamer fronts . </S>",
    "<S> technically , we identify the propagation of streamer fronts as an example of _ front propagation into unstable states_. in terms of the marginal stability scenario we then find : the front approached asymptotically starting from any sufficiently localized initial condition ( the `` selected front '' ) , is the steepest uniformly translating front solution , which is physical and stable . negatively charged fronts are selected by linear marginal stability , which allows us to derive their velocity analytically . positively charged fronts can only propagate due to electron diffusion against the electric field ; as a result their behavior is singular in the limit of @xmath4 . for @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> these fronts are selected by nonlinear marginal stability and we have to apply numerical methods for predicting the selected front velocity . for larger @xmath2 , linear marginal stability applies and the velocity can be determined analytically . </S>",
    "<S> numerical integrations of the temporal evolution of planar fronts out of localized initial conditions confirm all our analytical and numerical predictions for the selection . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our general predictions for the selected front velocity and for the degree of ionization of the plasma are in semi - quantitative agreement with recent numerical solutions of three - dimensional streamer propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this gives credence to our suggestion , that the front analysis on the inner ( @xmath6 m ) scale yields the moving boundary conditions for a moving `` streamer interface '' , whose pattern formation is governed by the evolution of the fields on the outer ( mm ) scale .    2 </S>"
