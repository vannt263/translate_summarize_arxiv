    "lattice boltzmann ( lb ) modelling schemes have emerged in the last several years as a powerful approach for simulating the dynamics of a variety of complex systems , from flow with suspended particles to multiphase flow through porous media  @xcite . of great interest",
    "is the extension of this method to the modelling of flow properties of viscoelastic materials such as polymer melts and amphiphilic fluids , where the dynamics of microscopic structures is coupled to the flow .",
    "qian deng  @xcite correctly described transverse wave propagation using a lattice bgk model with an _ ad hoc _ modified equilibrium distribution while ispolatov grant  @xcite obtained viscoelastic effects by adding a force to represent memory effects in the lb equation .",
    "however , both approaches involve the inclusion of macroscopic parameters such as young s modulus  @xcite or elastic coefficients  @xcite .",
    "these methods can not be regarded as fully mesoscopic as at least one parameter is imposed on the basis of macroscopic considerations .",
    "giraud et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a single fluid , two dimensional model to treat a macroscopically viscoelastic fluid and later lallemand et al .",
    "@xcite extended this model to three dimensions , but to the best of our knowledge no generalization for multiphase flow or flow with suspended particles has yet been implemented .",
    "a free energy ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model can be defined to study rheological properties of complex fluids@xcite . a popular lb scheme based on the same gl approach",
    "proceeds by defining an equilibrium distribution through the imposition of constraints on macroscopic thermomechanical quantities such as the stress tensor .",
    "using such a scheme , denninston et al .",
    "@xcite obtained non - newtonian flow behaviour ( including shear thinning and banding ) using an lb algorithm for the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals in the isotropic and nematic phases . however , with such methods the dynamics is not dictated by the mesoscopic processes ; numerical instability  @xcite can make this approach unsuitable for a fully mesoscopic description of the dynamics .",
    "gonzlez and coveney  @xcite , using a fully mesoscopic , kinetic approach which does not require the existence of a thermodynamic potential obtained a self assembled gyroid mesophase in the course of simulating an amphiphilic fluid formed by two immiscible fluids and a surfactant species ( fig .",
    "[ gyro ] ) .",
    "the term amphiphilic fluid is used to describe a fluid in which at least one species is made of surfactant molecules .",
    "surfactants are molecules comprised of a hydrophilic ( water - loving ) head group and a hydrophobic ( oil - loving ) tail .",
    "an amphiphilic fluid may contain oil , water , or both fluids in addition to surfactant .",
    "such complex fluids can self - assemble to form ordered structures such as lamellae , micelles , sponge and liquid crystalline ( cubic ) phases showing pronounced rheological properties@xcite .",
    "in this letter we use this purely kinetic lb method to model complex flows whose rheological properties are emergent from the mesoscopic kinetic processes without any imposed macroscopic constraints@xcite . in particular , we show evidence of the appearance of rheological effects , such as shear thinning and viscoelasticity , for a self - assembled gyroid liquid crystalline cubic mesophase .",
    "a standard lb system involving multiple species is usually represented by a set of equations  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the single - particle distribution function , indicating the density of species @xmath2 ( for example , oil , water or amphiphile ) , having velocity @xmath3 , at site @xmath4 on a d - dimensional lattice of coordination number @xmath5 , at time - step @xmath6 .",
    "the collision operator @xmath7 represents the change in the single - particle distribution function due to the collisions .",
    "we choose a single relaxation time @xmath8 , ` bgk ' form  @xcite for the collision operator in the limit of low mach numbers , the lb equations correspond to a solution of the navier - stokes equation for isothermal , quasi - incompressible fluid flow whose implementation can efficiently exploit parallel computers , as the dynamics at a point requires only information about quantities at nearest neighbour lattice sites .",
    "the local equilibrium distribution @xmath9 plays a fundamental role in the dynamics of the system as shown by eq .",
    "( [ lbeqs ] ) . in this study",
    ", we use a purely kinetic approach , for which the local equilibrium distribution @xmath10 is derived by imposing certain restrictions on the microscopic processes , such as explicit mass and total momentum conservation  @xcite @xmath11 \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the macroscopic bulk velocity of the fluid , defined as @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the coefficients resulting from the velocity space discretization and @xmath15 is the speed of sound , both of which are determined by the choice of the lattice , which is d3q19 in our implementation .",
    "immiscibility of species @xmath2 is introduced in the model following shan and chen  @xcite .",
    "only nearest neighbour interactions among the immiscible species are considered .",
    "these interactions are modelled as a self - consistently generated mean field body force @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the so - called effective mass , which can have a general form for modelling various types of fluids ( we use @xmath18)@xcite ) , and @xmath19 is a force coupling constant whose magnitude controls the strength of the interaction between components @xmath2 , @xmath20 and is set positive to mimic repulsion .",
    "the dynamical effect of the force is realized in the bgk collision operator in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) by adding to the velocity @xmath21 in the equilibrium distribution of eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) an increment    @xmath22    as described above , an amphiphile usually possesses two different fragments , each having an affinity for one of the two immiscible components .",
    "the addition of an amphiphile is implemented as in  @xcite .",
    "an average dipole vector @xmath23 is introduced at each site @xmath24 to represent the orientation of any amphiphile present there .",
    "the direction of this dipole vector is allowed to vary continuously and no information is specified for each velocity @xmath3 , for reasons of computational efficiency and simplicity .",
    "full details of the model can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we use lb3d@xcite , a highly scalable parallel lb code , to implement the model . a single simulation of a @xmath25 model , i.e. a point in fig.[fig1 ] below , needs around 300 mbytes of ram and takes about 50 cpu hours to complete on a single processor machine .",
    "the very good scaling of our lb3d code permits us to run all our simulations on multiprocessor machines and computational grids in order to reduce the length of data collection to a few weeks .",
    "the simulation parameters are those used in  @xcite that lead to the formation of gyroid mesophases .",
    "we use a @xmath25 lattice size with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations were all started from a checkpointed configuration of a @xmath26 timesteps equilibrated gyroid mesophase@xcite .",
    "a single unit cell of the gyroid minimal surface is of the order of @xmath27 lattice lengths in its linear dimensions .",
    "this implies that hundreds of unit cells are present in a @xmath25 sample .",
    "therefore , finite size effects are not expected to affect the qualitative outcome of the simulations . moreover ,",
    "some simulations with a @xmath28 lattice have been run to confirm the results obtained and the @xmath28 simulations reported in  @xcite are consistent with the results shown here .",
    "nevertheless , such lattice sizes oblige us to study perfect gyroids ; much larger system sizes ( and computational cost ) would be necessary in order to investigate the role of domains and their associated defects@xcite .",
    "we leave this for future work .    in order to inspect the rheological behaviour of gyroid mesophases ,",
    "we have implemented lees - edwards boundary conditions , which reduce finite size effects if compared to moving solid walls  @xcite .",
    "this computationally convenient method imposes new positions and velocities on particles leaving the simulation box in the direction perpendicular to the imposed shear strain while leaving the other coordinates unchanged .",
    "choosing @xmath29 as the direction of shear and @xmath30 as the direction of the velocity gradient , we have    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , u is the shear velocity , @xmath33 is the @xmath34component of @xmath21 and @xmath35 is the system length in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "we also use an interpolation scheme suggested by wagner pagonabarraga  @xcite as @xmath37 is not generally a multiple of the lattice site .",
    "cates et al .",
    "@xcite , found pronounced artefacts ( lock - ins ) in simulations of 2d sheared binary mixtures with multiple lees - edwards planes . in our own work , we have not seen any of these artefacts , even in the longest simulations performed , and a linear velocity profile is obtained at steady state .",
    "consistent with the hypothesis of the lb model , we set the maximum shear velocity to @xmath38 lattice units .",
    "this results in a maximum shear rate @xmath39 in lattice units .",
    "simulations are run for @xmath40 timesteps in the case of steady shear .",
    "steady state is reached in the first @xmath41 timesteps , and the relevant component of the stress tensor is averaged over the last @xmath42 timesteps .",
    "some measurements were repeated by doubling the simulation time to a total of @xmath43 timesteps but no significant differences were found .",
    "for oscillatory shear , we set @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the frequency of oscillation and @xmath46 lattice units .",
    "these simulations were run for at least three complete oscillations , @xmath47 timesteps .",
    "in order to investigate rheological properties of the system , we perform simulations of flow under shear , mimicking a rheometer .",
    "we set @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 to impose a stationary couette flow .",
    "once steady state flow is reached , we collect the relevant component of the pressure tensor @xmath51 . according to newton s law for viscous flow of a liquid we have    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the viscosity of the liquid and @xmath54 . in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath51 against the imposed non - dimensionalized ( see text below ) shear rate @xmath55 ( weissenberg number ) .",
    "we note that the slope of the curve changes as these shear rate increases .",
    "this indicates that the viscosity @xmath53 depends on the shear rate @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our model exhibits non - newtonian flow behaviour .",
    "complex fluids such as amphiphilic mixtures are well known to exhibit such behaviour experimentally  @xcite . in the inset",
    "we calculate the percentage drop of @xmath53 by averaging the slope of the curve over subsets of four data points .",
    "we note that the viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases .",
    "this behaviour is referred to as `` shear thinning ''  @xcite . in general ,",
    "fluids exhibit macroscopic non - newtonian properties because of underlying complex mesoscopic interactions and leading to changes in their microstructural properties . in our case ,",
    "the highly ordered structure of the gyroid mesophase is responsible for this rheological effect , and our lb model correctly captures it .",
    "therefore , considering the underlying physics of mesophases , this simulation result is not only justified but also expected .",
    "we note that the predictions of the model could be directly verified , but no experimental evidence for gyroid rheology is currently available in the literature .    for oscillatory shear , in eq .",
    "( [ coseno ] ) we set @xmath46 lattice units and we span a range of two decades of frequencies by varying @xmath58 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 lattice units . for a viscoelastic medium @xmath61\\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the imposed shear strain and @xmath63 , @xmath64 are , respectively , the storage and loss moduli which respectively measure the elastic and viscous response at any given frequency  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the time dependence of @xmath51 for two simulations with different values of @xmath58 . after a brief transient",
    ", @xmath51 begins to oscillate as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ moduli ] ) with the imposed frequency @xmath58 and an amplitude @xmath65 and shift @xmath66 that depend on the storage and loss moduli    @xmath67    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the fitted values for the amplitude and phase shift .",
    "we derive @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the two different values of @xmath68 by fitting @xmath65 and @xmath66 with the standard levenberg - marquardt algorithm over at least three decades ( see caption for details ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot @xmath51 against the shear strain at different times ( lissajous plots ) for the two frequencies of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we note that for the higher frequency ( left panel ) , @xmath51 is in phase with the strain , indicating that the gyroid mesophase exhibits a solid - like response at short timescales .",
    "for the smaller frequency , the phase shift is almost @xmath69 , typical of a liquid - like response as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ liquid ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the different simulation values of @xmath58 . in order to capture the relevant scales in the model , all quantities are dimensionless .",
    "in particular , the frequency @xmath58 has been multiplied by the characteristic stress relaxation time , @xmath72 simulation timesteps , calculated by fitting the exponential decay of @xmath51 when shear is removed .",
    "we note that a crossover between @xmath70 and @xmath71 occurs at @xmath73 .",
    "this signals a transition between solid and liquid - like behaviour and indicates that our lb model is capable of predicting viscoelastic flow ; see also fig .",
    "( [ gyro ] ) and caption .",
    "we note that a dimensionless crossover point of @xmath74 consistently links rheological properties of the mixture with the relaxation time of the gyroid mesophase .",
    "this is encouraging for the use of this simulation model to inspect the correlation between macroscopic dynamics and mesoscopic structure . indeed in the case of linear viscoelasticity ,",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 as @xmath58 goes to @xmath77 for any fluids . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot lines @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a guide for the eye ; our data show excellent quantitative agreement with theory .",
    "we interpret the elastic response component as due to the stress response to mechanical perturbations of the long - range ordered equilibrium structure of the liquid gyroid crystalline mesophase .",
    "we also tried to fit the data in fig.[fig4 ] to a simple single relaxation time ( maxwell ) model of viscoelasticity but the fit is very poor .",
    "this suggests that there are several relaxation times present , as is to be expected here since the viscoelasticity arises from complex mesoscale structure .",
    "we note that the existence of a spectrum of relaxation times is consistent with the stretched - exponential behaviour of domain self - assembly in amphiphilic fluid systems found in  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we use a purely kinetic lb model that leads to the emergence of non - trivial rheological properties .",
    "non - newtonian behaviour , in this case a decrease of viscosity with shear rate , has been shown for an initially self - assembled gyroid liquid crystalline mesophase .",
    "in addition , linear viscoelastic effects in the system are manifest in the simulations .",
    "it is notable that our model correctly predicts the theoretical limits for the moduli @xmath63 , @xmath64 as @xmath58 goes to @xmath77 as well as a crossover in @xmath63 , @xmath64 at higher @xmath58 .",
    "we note that , unlike previous approaches , this model does not require any assumptions at the macroscopic level , that is it provides a purely kinetic - theoretical approach to the description of complex fluids .",
    "this model can therefore help in understanding complex flows , such as flow of viscoelastic liquids in porous media , colloidal fluids and polymer melts .",
    "work is in progress to assess the generality of this approach within our lattice - boltzmann model of amphiphilic fluids . in particular",
    ", such simulations should enable us to investigate the link between mesoscopic structure and macroscopic dynamics , for example by correlating rheological relaxation times to mesoscale relaxation processes within the amphiphilic fluid .",
