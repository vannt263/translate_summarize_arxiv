    "the entanglement is an intrinsic property of composite quantum systems and represents a cornerstone in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the role of quantum entanglement in classical manipulation of quantum objects , and to quantify the degree of entanglement .",
    "although the question of quantification is not clearly resolved , the quantum information theory offers several measures @xcite of entanglement .",
    "quantum information theory also gave a new birth or fresh interpretation of a class of methods for numerical simulation of many - body quantum systems which , due to the exponential growth of hilbert space , can not be manipulated using exact diagonalization .",
    "the methods originally known as density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite deploy the fact that many degrees of freedom are redundant in quantum state description ; the system is therefore adequately described by taking into account maximally entangled components only .",
    "thus , sufficiently slow growth of the entanglement is of crucial importance .",
    "dmrg enjoyed remarkable success in determining the ground state properties of large one - dimensional quantum models , for which the degree of entanglement scales at most logarithmically with size @xcite , however its _ time - dependent _ version ( tdmrg ) @xcite is often plagued by abundance of entanglement with time evolution @xcite . for efficient classical simulation of many body quantum dynamics using tdmrg",
    "it is required that the computational costs grow polynomially in time meaning that the degree of entanglement of any quantum object which can be represented as an element of a scalable tensor product hilbert space ( either a pure state , or a mixed state / operator , etc ) must grow no faster than logarithmically .",
    "it was recently shown that this is generically not the case for _ quantum chaotic _",
    "ising spin chain in a tilted magnetic field where the entanglement entropies grow linearly and hence the computation costs increase exponentially in time @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the model of quantum ising chain in transverse magnetic field which is integrable and an explicit analytical solution exists .",
    "calabrese and cardy @xcite have shown numerically that the growth of entanglement entropy is _ linear _ for evolution of pure initial states which are ground states of quenched hamiltonians ; see also ref.@xcite . however , from efficiency of tdmrg for time evolution of local operators @xcite one may conclude that entanglement entropy computed in the space of operators grows only logarithmically . here",
    "we address this problem theoretically using the idea @xcite of re - formulating the heisenberg evolution in an algebra of operators in terms of a schr \" odinger evolution generated by a different - adjoint hamiltonian acting on the hilbert space of operator algebra .",
    "we show that operator space entanglement entropy saturates in time for initial local operators of finite index ( precise definitions follow ) and explicitly compute the saturation values in the critical case .",
    "further , for initial local operators of infinite index we give accurate numerical evidence and a theoretical hint that the growth is logarithmic ( in thermodynamic limit ) with prefactor @xmath1 in critical , or @xmath2 in non - critical case .",
    "we note that , to best of our knowledge , the entanglement in operator space is a new concept which has not yet been considered theoretically , and it is clearly not equivalent to the conventional concept of entanglement of density operators as discussed in sect.[sect : conclusions ] . yet , it is the one which we expect to be more closely related to computational complexity of time - evolution in infinite interacting quantum systems .",
    "the dynamics of a transverse ising chain of length @xmath3 is described in terms of canonical pauli matrices @xmath4 for sites @xmath5 and the hamiltonian @xmath6 with open boundary conditions , which can be diagonalized by means of jordan - wigner transformation and introduction of majorana fermion operators @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 fulfilling the anti - commutation relations @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "the schr \" odinger equation extends to arbitrary element of the operator algebra @xmath31 .",
    "note that the number of a - fermions , @xmath32 is conserved , unlike the number of ordinary majorana fermions .",
    "it is clear that classical simulability of quantum states is quantified by the entanglement entropy of half - half ( or worst case ) bipartition of the lattice .",
    "however , for simulability of quantum observables ( or density operators of mixed states ) , the decisive quantity is an analog of entanglement entropy defined for an arbitrary element of operator algebra @xmath33 , with the adjoint reduced density matrix @xmath34 namely @xmath35 for a spin 1/2 chain it is perhaps more natural to use a set of @xmath17 pauli operators @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as a physical basis of operator algebra @xmath21 , and define bi - partition and entanglement entropy with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is easy to show that the result is identical to ( [ eq : sreducedr ] ) since the transformation between the bases @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a simple _ permutation _ of multiindices @xmath42 ( with multiplications by @xmath43 ) , and even though it is _ non - local _ it maps first @xmath44 a - fermions to only first @xmath44 spins and vice versa .",
    "let us now try to compute _ time - dependence _ of operator space entanglement entropy @xmath45 for some simple initial operators @xmath22 . for convenience ,",
