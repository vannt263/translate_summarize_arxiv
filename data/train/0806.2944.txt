    "violation of the lepton flavor symmetry plays an important role for exploring new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations which are observed in many experiments , indicate that lepton flavor symmetry is broken and the minimal sm must be extended to accommodate non - zero neutrino masses . up to present , the lepton flavor violation ( lfv )",
    "has only been observed in the neutrino sector .",
    "this violation is induced by the neutrino masses and existence of the right - handed neutrinos . by contrast , for the charged lepton sector",
    ", there is no any evidence for such a violation .",
    "many studies have been devoted to explore the lfv through @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested to look for lfv via charmonium @xmath1 decays . in terms of the database of @xmath5 @xmath1 data at bes processes @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite",
    "have been explored and upper limits for their branching fractions were set .",
    "new hope is raised that the forthcoming upgraded besiii will accumulate up to @xmath8 @xmath1 per year @xcite , which makes it possible to test lfv with a much higher precision .",
    "it is well known that the sm contribution to such violation can only occur via loops and are very suppressed , so that can not produce observable effects even with so large database of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore it is time to investigate possibility of discovering such violation in terms of the theoretical models beyond sm .    recently , georgi proposed an interesting idea that a scale invariant stuff may exist in our world .",
    "the scale invariant stuff contains no particle , but the so - called unparticle @xcite . to be consistent with the present experimental observations , in the effective theory about the unparticle",
    ", the coupling of unparticle to the ordinary standard model ( sm ) matter must be sufficiently weak .",
    "the scale dimension of unparticle is in general fractional rather than an integral number .",
    "the interactions between the unparticle and the sm particles in low energy effective theory can lead to various interesting phenomenology .",
    "there have been many phenomenological and theoretical explorations related to unparticles in literature . since",
    "interaction between unparticle and ordinary sm matter is rather weak , we can expect that its participation can not produce observable effects for the processes ( production and decays ) which have large rates , but definitely may play important roles in the rare processes where the sm contribution are suppressed .    in unparticle physics",
    ", the unparticle can couple to different flavors of the sm leptons and thus induce lfv even at tree level .",
    "there have been several studies of lfv in unparticle physics , for instance , @xmath9 in @xcite ; @xmath10 in @xcite ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 in @xcite ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 conversion in @xcite ; muonium and antimuonium oscillation in @xcite ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 in @xcite . in this work",
    ", we propose to study lfv in unparticle physics via @xmath17 decays .",
    "there are several advantages of exploring lfv in @xmath17 decays , in particular the @xmath6 process . on the experimental side ,",
    "the final states contain only leptons which are easy to detect .",
    "compared to @xmath12 processes which occur due to non - resonance contribution , a large database of @xmath1 is expected at besiii which will begin running very soon . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the processes @xmath17 are free of hadronic uncertainties after the parameter related to the binding effect of @xmath1 is experimentally determined by measuring @xmath18 .",
    "anyhow , an observation of @xmath19 would be a clear indication of new physics beyond sm . in our case , @xmath20 in @xmath1 annihilate into a virtual unparticle which later converts into two leptons @xmath21 with different flavors . as we will show that the theoretical prediction on the branching ratio of @xmath22 can reach about @xmath23 order , which is absolutely possible to be observed at besiii . to help or experimental colleagues , on the basis of besiii environments , we carry out an investigation on the possibility of search for @xmath6 in terms of a monta carlo simulation .",
    "we start with a brief review about the unparticle physics which is relevant to this study .",
    "the scale invariant unparticle fields emerge below an energy scale @xmath24 which is assumed to be at the order of tev .",
    "the interactions of the unparticle with the sm particles are described by a low energy effective theory .",
    "the coupling of unparticle to sm fermions ( quarks and leptons ) is generally given by the following effective operators as |ff o _ , |f_5 f o _ , |f_f ^o _ ,     @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the scalar and vector unparticle fields , respectively .",
    "tensor unparticle does not contribute in our case .",
    "the @xmath27 are dimensionless coefficients . because @xmath1 is a vector , only the vector current @xmath28 couples to @xmath1 . for a scalar unparticle coupling @xmath29 ,",
    "it is proportional to the momentum of the unparticle . using the equations of motion",
    ", one can immediately show that this part is proportional to the lepton masses in decays of @xmath30 and thus is suppressed .",
    "consequently , we will only consider the effective interaction @xmath31 which dominates in the decays of @xmath17 .",
    "for the vector unparticle field , the propagator is given by d^4 x e^ipx0    @xmath32 at the denominator implies that the scale dimension @xmath33 can not be integers except @xmath34 .",
    "the peculiar unparticle propagator and the phase factor @xmath35 which provides a cp conserving phase produces novel effects in high energy scattering processes @xcite , cp violation @xcite , neutral meson mixing @xcite and neutrino processes @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     now , we can set an upper limit for @xmath36 if there only few events are observed in besiii and they are consistent with the background estimation .",
    "for an illustration , we discuss a case similar to that we did for besii where there were four @xmath37 candidates observed by the detector @xcite .",
    "although our real case may be different , the analysis should provide a useful reference . with the four observed events which are supposed to be the signal and 11.5 background events from hadronic channels in besiii",
    ", we gave an upper limit for @xmath36 as br<(n_ob , n_bg)/[n_t _ j / e ] .",
    "where @xmath38 is calculated using the method of @xcite to be @xmath38=2.31 is obtained at 90@xmath39 c.l .. therefore , we obtain @xmath40 in the besiii experiment , which is more precise than the besii by two orders .",
    "now let us discuss the case with branching ratio being about @xmath41 as the unparticle physics predicts .",
    "if the total selection efficiency for @xmath42 is @xmath43 , then , about 70 events are passed through the selection criterion of @xmath6 in 10 billion @xmath1 events collected by besiii during one year of running . from table 3",
    ", there are 11.5 background events as estimated .",
    "then , the signal to noise ratio reaches about 7:1 .",
    "it is possible to determinate the branching ratio of @xmath6 since the signal significance is enough .",
    "in fact , the electron and muon identification is very important in the analysis of the concerned channels .",
    "the muon identification in besiii is better than the one in besii .",
    "certainly , the contamination rate for kaons being misidentified as muons should be lower than the one for pions @xcite . in the work , however , the contamination rate for kaons being misidentified as muons has to be set to the same as the contamination rate for pions being misidentified as muons , because of lack of precise information about kaons .",
    "so the background for @xmath6 is overestimated in this work .",
    "in fact , the background in besiii should be less than that estimated in the work .",
    "therefore , the real signal to noise ratio for @xmath22 is higher in real besiii experiments .",
    "the lepton flavor violating decays of @xmath17 provide an ideal probe to explore new physics beyond the minimal standard model . in this study",
    ", we have presented a detailed analysis on the contribution of unparticle physics to @xmath17 decays .",
    "the coupling of unparticle to different flavors of leptons cause the lfv processes at tree level .    even though the scaling factor @xmath44 which is sensitive to the scale dimension of the unparticle field suppresses lfv , one still hopes to observe such rare processes at experiments with very high luminosity and precision . within a reasonably chosen parameter space ,",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath6 can reach about an order of @xmath23 which is possible to be observed at the forthcoming besiii .    indeed , the besiii is planning to produce @xmath8 @xmath1 per year .",
    "these huge data samples guarantee an exploration of lfv with a high precision . as a moderate estimation ,",
    "the upper limit of measuring @xmath45 is obtained as @xmath46 at besiii .",
    "if so , the unparticle theory indeed predicts a production rate within this range and lfv should be observed . as discussed above ,",
    "the background for such lepton - flavor violating processes is relatively clean and the signal - to - noise is high , so that observation would be more optimistic .    as we know , to judge validity of a new physics model , usually one can not decide its existence only by a unique experiment , but needs a combination of data from various measurements . such a synthesis analysis may help to confirm a new model .",
    "phenomenological analysis on effects induced by unparticle physics has been carried out for various production and decay processes and even the cosmology . in general , the concerned parameters , such as its coupling to sm matter , scale dimension @xmath33 and other characteristics are constrained by earlier analysis , therefore it seems to be the time to let experiment tell us the validity of the whole theory .",
    "thus our conclusion is that observation of the lepton - flavor violating decays may provide an important test of the unparticle scenario . if the observation confirms the predicted value , the unparticle theory would be greatly supported ( even though relatively large uncertainty still remains ) , by contrary ,",
    "if the reaction is not seen at besiii , one may set a more stringent constraint on the parameters which would be applied to other experiments for further tests .",
