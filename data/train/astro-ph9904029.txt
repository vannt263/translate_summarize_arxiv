    "the luminosity distribution of ellipticals and bulges of s0 galaxies has been modelled for long using the @xmath0 formula ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) , which is characterized by just two scale parameters , the effective radius @xmath1 and the effective surface brightness @xmath2 of the isophote encircling half of the total light .",
    "more recently showed that a generalized de vaucouleurs formula , @xmath3 , obtained by adding a free exponent @xmath4 @xcite , not only gives a better fit to the light profiles ( which is expected in view of the larger number of parameters ) , but it provides also an interesting correlation between shape ( @xmath4 ) and total luminosity ( @xmath5 ) , which in turn suggests that the family of elliptical galaxies is not homologous .",
    "the main criticism moved to this result is that the observed trend of @xmath4 with @xmath6 may be due to the presence of hidden disks embedded in elliptical galaxies : the larger is this disk , the smaller comes the value of @xmath4 .    caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) had obtained their result by fitting the main - axes light profiles using just the @xmath3 law . in view of the above criticism",
    ", we decided to pinpoint the question by adopting a 2d fitting procedure allowing the presence of the disk ; 2d is needed in order to strongly couple and exploit the different projection properties of components such as disk and bulge which are expected to have quite different intrinsic thickness .",
    "a non - linear least square fit minimizing the @xmath7 has been applied to the same volume - limited sample of caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : it contains @xmath8 early - type galaxies belonging to either the virgo or the fornax cluster .",
    "this sample is @xmath9 complete down to @xmath10 mag , equivalent to @xmath11 if we assume a distance modulus @xmath12 for both clusters .    in the following we outline the adopted methodology and summarize the results of this work ( donofrio et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "our 2d fitting models are based on the superposition of up to two components , each one characterized by concentric and coaxial elliptical isophotes with constant flattening .",
    "one such component may be thought as the projection of a spheroid with finite intrinsic thichness , thus mimicking a bulge . for this component",
    "only we allow a moderate degree of boxiness / diskiness .",
    "the other component is thought to be a disk .",
    "* model 1 * is the 2d extension of the one used in their work by caon et al .",
    "it consists of a spheroidal component only whose projected light distribution follows the generalized de vaucouleurs law :    @xmath13\\ ] ]    with @xmath14 and @xmath15^{1/c}$ ] ; @xmath16 is the parameter accounting for some boxiness / diskiness ( @xmath17 for boxy isophotes and @xmath18 for disky isophotes ) .",
    "is made by the superposition of a bulge - like component with a @xmath0 light distribution ( same as eq .",
    "1 , with @xmath19 ) to an exponential disk represented as :    @xmath20    with @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "is a generalization of model 2 ; the light distribution of the bulge follows a @xmath3 law , but the disk remains exponential .    in summary ,",
    "the structural parameters involved in these models are : the effective surface brightness @xmath2 and the effective radius @xmath1 of the spheroid , the free exponent @xmath4 when considered , the central surface brightness @xmath22 and the scale length of the disk @xmath23 if included , the apparent axial ratios @xmath24 for the bulge and the disk components , and the boxiness / diskiness parameter @xmath16 .",
    "a number of simulations on artificial galaxies have been performed in order to test the tool and to unveil the systematic effects that influence the model parameters ; in particular the seeing , which produces strongly biased results even after proper convolution of the model , and can be taken care only by masking out the central area of the galaxies .",
    "the simulations also provided a more correct estimate of the errors of the model parameters .",
    "the three adopted models do not provide the same accuracy in reproducing the light distribution of early - type galaxies . by examining the reduced @xmath7 , the 2d residuals , and by comparing the geometry of the model ( ellipticity and @xmath25 profiles ) with the real galaxies , we concluded that the @xmath26 model has to be preferred to either the simple @xmath3 and the @xmath27 models .",
    "model 1 is comparable to model 3 in reproducing dwarf elliptical galaxies ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "model 2 often produces extended luminous halos not observed in the real objects .",
    "it is evident that the reduced @xmath7 by itself does not guarantee the physical significance of the best - fit solution for models with different numbers of parameters .",
    "we performed also an f - test of the best - fit @xmath7 distributions , in order to verify whether the variances are different even from a statistical point of view .",
    "actually , however , we may try to attach a physical meaning to the most complex and best - fitting model , that of @xmath29 , only after analyzing and falsifying the correlations among the different parameters .    in general the best fitting model",
    "does not work in the inner seeing - dominated region ( @xmath30 ) and in the outer parts , where an extended luminous ` halo ' is often found , but it is good in the intermediate regions for a large range of @xmath31 .",
    "we confirm the correlation between the effective radius @xmath1 and the effective surface brightness @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath32 relation ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a family of large bulges with @xmath33 kpc and with low surface brightness @xmath2 , as found by .",
    "the separation between _ ordinary _ and _ bright _ galaxies is well visible , even if the gap between the two families is less clear .",
    "the bulges of spirals all belong to the ordinary family ( @xmath34 kpc ) .",
    "2 shows the @xmath35 relation .",
    "the open circles represent the old distribution , found by for the same sample of galaxies by fitting the equivalent light profiles .",
    "the dashed line marks the value @xmath19 of the de vaucouleurs law . by comparing the old relation with the new one , we observe that there is not a variation within the errors of the parameters .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter spans a wide range of values ( @xmath36 ) : low values are typical of exponential bulges ( already known to exist in spiral galaxies ) , while high values are found in bright and large galaxies .",
    "this result confirms that the different values of @xmath4 are not due to the presence of a disk , but that there is a clear trend in the values of @xmath4 with the galaxy size ( and therefore with the total luminosity ) for the spheroidal components .",
    "it follows that the non - homology is likely a characteristic of hot stellar systems .",
    "our best fit solutions tell us that in quite a few ( @xmath37 ) elliptical galaxies there is a central exponential component . this is not surprising for the disky ellipticals , in which an ` embedded disk ' , generally smaller and brighter than normal disks in s0 s and spirals ,",
    "gives a characteristic disky shape to the isophotes ( , ) .",
    "however , we found an inner exponential component ( with bright @xmath38 and small @xmath23 ) also in the bright , boxy ellipticals .",
    "we verified _ a posteriori _ that such small and bright ` disks ' are a first order approximation of the inner cores of elliptical galaxies , well described by the nuker law ( , and ) .",
    "fig.3 shows the central surface brightness @xmath39 ( corrected for inclination assuming a zero - thickness disk ) , plotted versus the scale length @xmath40 of the detected ` disks ' .",
    "the distribution of values is large : it goes from small and bright ` disks ' ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 kpc ) , many of them hosted by luminous e galaxies , to less luminous and great disks , preferably found in s0 and low luminosity ellipticals .",
    "the disk parameters of normal spirals ( from ) are also included in the diagram for comparison .",
    "it seems that the whole distribution follows approximately the lines of constant disk luminosities ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the spiral disks of de jong s sample are brighter than the early - type disks of our sample and extend towards fainter @xmath39 and longer scale length @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath39 does not peak around the freeman value ( solid line ) ( , ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we plotted the effective radius @xmath43 of the bulge component versus the scale length @xmath40 .",
    "it is apparent there is a correlation between these parameters , but with two separated trends , one for the bulge dominated systems ( upper part of the diagram ) , and another for the disk dominated galaxies ( bottom part of the diagram ) .",
    "it seems also that galaxies with very small bulges and disks ( @xmath44 kpc ) as well as systems with large @xmath1 and @xmath23 ( @xmath45kpc ) do not exist .",
    "we note that the lack of objects with large size can not be a bias , since our sample is complete in luminosity .",
    "by applying a full 2d fit of the light distribution of a volume - limited sample of early - type galaxies we obtained the following results :    1 .   the luminosity distribution of bright e galaxies is well represented by the superposition of an inner exponential component and a large outer bulge .",
    "this inner structure is characterized by an hight central surface brightness and a small scale length .",
    "it is likely that the detected component is the core of the galaxy .",
    "it seems important , however , that this component follows the same photometric properties of normal disks , although shifted in zero point .",
    "2 .   the distribution of @xmath39 for all detected ` disks ' is a function of the scale length @xmath23 .",
    "the slope of the relation is that of constant disk luminosities .",
    "the central surface brightness @xmath22 spans a wide range of values , in contrast with the claimed constant value .",
    "the effective radii of the bulges and the scale lengths of the ` disks ' are correlated : this suggests a possible coupling during the galaxy formation between the two components , and that the angular momentum should be an important parameter for the hubble sequence .",
    "the effective radius @xmath1 correlates with @xmath2 and with the exponent @xmath4 of the generalized de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the existence of two families of spheroids is confirmed as well as the increasing of @xmath4 for large luminous bulges .",
    "this suggests that elliptical galaxies are not homologous systems ."
