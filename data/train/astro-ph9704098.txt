    "the hegra iact system is located on the canary island of la palma , at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto astrofisico de canarias , at a height of about 2200  m asl . in its final form",
    ", the hegra iact array will consist of five identical telescopes with 8.5  m@xmath4 mirror area , 5  m focal length , and 271-pixel cameras with a pixel size of @xmath5 and a field of view of @xmath6 .",
    "four telescopes are arranged in the corners of a square with roughly 100  m side length , the fifth telescope is located in the center of the square .",
    "the cameras are read out by flash - adcs .",
    "the two - level trigger requires a coincidence of two neighboring pixels to trigger a telescope , and a coincidence of at least two telescope triggers to initiate the readout .",
    "the first telescope with the final 271-pixel camera ( ct3 ) came into operation late in 1995 , and clear signals for @xmath0-ray emission from the crab nebula were seen in the 1995 and 1996 single - telescope data , see fig .",
    "[ ct3_crab ] .",
    "the data discussed in the following were taken in dec .",
    "96 and jan .",
    "97 , shortly after the commissioning of the next three telescopes ct4,5,6 and their electronics . during this period ,",
    "four of the five telescopes ( ct3,4,5,6 ) were operational with the 271-pixel cameras .",
    "three of these used the final 120  mhz vme flash - adc readout ; one ( ct4 ) was still equipped with an interim 40  mhz vme flash - adc system",
    ". the lower sampling frequency results in increased integration times and somewhat higher sky noise for this telescope .",
    "the data presented here were taken with a simple two - pixel concidence for the telescope trigger , without a next - neighbor requirement . the fifth system telescope ( ct2 ) was still equipped with an old , coarser 61-pixel camera and camac adcs .",
    "it was operated independently from the other telescopes and is not used in the analysis discussed in the following . the same is true for the smaller prototype telescope ct1 .",
    "use of four rather than five telescopes reduces the rate by 20% and 30% for two - telescope and three - telescope triggers , respectively .",
    "in addition , for the data set used in the analysis presented here , the central telescope ( ct3 ) was always required among the triggering telescopes , resulting in an additional rate loss of about 25% compared to the normal situation , where any two telescopes would trigger the iact array .    given the short time since the data was taken , and the emphasis on continued installation and tests of the hardware , the software algorithms for data analysis as well as our understanding of the properties of the system and its optimization are still imperfect . also , geometric calibration data were not yet available in sufficient quantity and quality for all telescopes .    given these various caveats , the following performance figures , though quite remarkable , should not be taken to reflect the ultimate performance of such an array ; one should expect detection rates to increase by a factor 1.5 to 2 , with a corresponding increase in sensitivity .",
    "the individual hegra telescopes are triggered if two pixels exceed a preset threshold , within a coincidence window of about 12  ns .",
    "presently , any two pixels may trigger the telescope . in future",
    ", a hardware next - neighbor unit will require that at least two trigger pixels are direct neighbors , to further reduce the rate of random coincidences . in earlier single - telescope observations ,",
    "the next - neighbor check was emulated in software , providing a trigger verification after about 100  @xmath7s .",
    "this delay is however not compatible with the timing of the multi - telescope coincidence .",
    "the individual telescope trigger signals are routed to a central station , where they are delayed in a custom designed vme unit , to compensate differences in timing which arise since the cherenkov light front does not reach all telescopes at the same time .",
    "the delay values are updated continuously as the source moves across the sky . to trigger the readout of the iact array , at least two telescopes have to trigger within a time window of 70  ns ; this window is large compared to the timing jitter between telescope signals , of order 10  ns .",
    "an inter - telescope coincidence causes a global trigger signal and an event number to be transmitted back to all telescopes , including those which did not trigger themselves .",
    "after such a global trigger , the flash - adcs stop recording signals , the local vme cpu at each telescope locates the appropriate time slice in the flash - adc memory , and reads out the data , with on - line sparsification .",
    "data are buffered and multi - event packets are sent via ethernet to a central event builder station .",
    "[ fig_rates ] shows the trigger rates for one single telescope ( ct3 ) and for a coincidence of two given telescopes ( ct3,4 ) , as a function of the pixel trigger threshold in mv .",
    "one photoelectron corresponds roughly to 1.2  mv . for low tresholds",
    ", the single - telescope rate shows a very steep dependence on the pixel trigger threshold . in this regime , triggers are almost entirely caused by random coincidences due to night - sky photons ; the observed rate is fully consistent with the expected random rate calculated from the measured single - pixel rates and the width of the coincidence window . only for thresholds above 25  mv",
    "the dependence flattens out , and genuine air - shower triggers dominate . in contrast , the two - telescope trigger rate is over the entire range , down to pixel thresholds of 8  mv , governed by air showers , and exihibits a slope similar to the integral cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "for such a trigger , the choice of the pixel thresholds is no longer determined purely by the onset of noise triggers , but rather by other considerations such as the minimal light yield required to generate a useable image .",
    "for any given pixel threshold , the rate of two - telescope ( ct3,4 ) coincidences is smaller than the rate of good single - telescope ( ct3 ) triggers .",
    "the reason is twofold : on the one hand the effective area of a two - telescope coincidence is smaller than that of a single telescope , since both telescopes have to be located within the light pool of an air shower . on the other hand ,",
    "the coincidence requirement provides already at the trigger level a suppression of hadron - induced showers as compared to @xmath0-ray showers .",
    "[ tb ]    .__experimentally determined pixel thresholds and resulting energy thresholds for different trigger modes .",
    "the pixel thresholds are chosen such that the rate of random 2-pixel coincidences is small ( o(10% ) ) compared to the rate of triggers caused by air showers .",
    "the energy thresholds are derived using monte carlo simulations ; the thresholds refer to @xmath0-rays and are defined as the energy with the peak differential counting rate for a source with a spectral index similar to the cosmic - ray spectrum , for vertical incidence . _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     to provide a consistency check , table  [ tab_rates ] also includes monte carlo based estimates for the detection rates . for the @xmath0-ray source a differential spectral index of 2.7 is assumed , and a flux of @xmath8/@xmath3s above 1 tev .",
    "recent single - telescope hegra measurements give values for the crab flux above 1  tev of @xmath9/@xmath3 @xcite and @xmath10/@xmath3 @xcite , with a spectral index of @xmath11 , and @xmath12/@xmath3 @xcite above 1.5  tev .",
    "the raw detection rates given in the table are based on the fast simulation tool using parametrized trigger efficiencies .",
    "the monte carlo estimates for the rates before cuts should be reliable within 50% .",
    "given these caveats , the agreement of simulated and measured rates before cuts is surprisingly good .",
    "the monte carlo selection efficiencies quoted in the table refer to early simulations , which were carried out using a slightly different configuration and different selection criteria , and should only serve to illustrate approximate magnitudes ; the cuts used in the present data analysis are obviously somewhat tighter .",
    "the angular resolution has been simulated  @xcite using the identical algorithm used for shower reconstruction , and the predicted value of 0.1@xmath13 is in good agreement with the measured ( projected ) resolution of @xmath14 after cuts , or @xmath15 before cuts .",
    "( the cuts bias towards well - measured narrow showers , resulting in a slightly improved resolution . )",
    "in summary , it seems appropriate to state that while both the hardware of the hegra iact array and the analysis techniques are still evolving and further improvements are to be expected , existing data clearly demonstrate the power and the potential of the stereoscopic approach .",
    "the detection rates and angular resolutions are consistent with expectations based on monte - carlo studies .",
    "data clearly demonstrate the lower trigger thresholds achievable with a telescope coincidence trigger , the high level of suppression of the cosmic - ray background , and the superior angular resolution .",

    "we thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the use of the site and for providing excellent working conditions .",
