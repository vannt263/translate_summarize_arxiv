    "the tunnel leveling theorem of h. goda , m. scharlemann , and a. thompson  @xcite says that when a tunnel number one knot is in minimal bridge position , any of its tunnel arcs can be slid to lie in a single horizontal level .",
    "using the theory of tunnel number @xmath0 knots developed in  @xcite , we will prove the _ tunnel leveling addendum . _ roughly speaking , it says that when a tunnel arc is in level position as in the conclusion of the tunnel leveling theorem , the other two knots from the @xmath5-curve which is the union of the knot and its tunnel arc are also ( after trivial repositioning ) in minimal bridge position .",
    "its full statement is given near the start of section  [ sec : efficient ] .",
    "the tunnel leveling addendum gives a great deal of information about bridge numbers of tunnel number @xmath0 knots .",
    "some of these applications involve the _ depth _ invariant , which is defined using the theory from  @xcite .",
    "the depth of a tunnel , @xmath6 , is somewhat similar to the ( hempel ) distance @xmath7 ( see j. johnson @xcite and y. minsky , y. moriah , and s. schleimer @xcite ) , but unlike the distance , the depth is very easy to calculate in terms of the parameter description of tunnels given in  @xcite .",
    "the two invariants are related by the inequality @xmath8 but the depth can be much larger than the distance . indeed , the `` middle '' tunnels of torus knots that we examine below are easily seen to have distance  @xmath9 , but we will see their depths can be arbitrarily large .    the depth invariant can be defined geometrically in terms of the cabling constructions of  @xcite , but it also has a geometric interpretation in terms of a construction that first appeared in  @xcite . that construction , which we call a giant step , is studied in  @xcite .",
    "there is no upper bound for the bridge number of a knot in terms of the depths of its tunnels , but among our applications of the tunnel leveling addendum is a sharp lower bound :    for @xmath10 , the minimum bridge number of a knot having a tunnel of depth  @xmath1 is given recursively by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath16 and consequently @xmath17 .",
    "this improves lemma  2 of @xcite , which is that bridge number grows at least linearly with distance .",
    "it also improves proposition  1.11 of @xcite , which implies that bridge number grows at least as fast as  @xmath18 .",
    "actually , the minimum bridge number theorem can be proven using only the tunnel leveling theorem , which give the lower bounds , and some explicit constructions to realize the minimum values .",
    "our upper bound result , however , uses the full strength of the tunnel leveling addendum :    write the fibonacci sequence @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "the maximum bridge number of a knot having a tunnel produced by @xmath3 cabling constructions , of which the first @xmath21 produce simple or semisimple tunnels , is @xmath22 .",
    "( the terms `` simple '' and `` semisimple '' are recalled in section  [ sec : cabling ] . ) for fixed @xmath3 , the largest value for the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : max ] occurs when @xmath23 , giving the following absolute maximum :    the maximum bridge number of a knot having a tunnel produced by @xmath3 cabling operations is  @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , this maximum bridge number is achieved by a sequence of torus knot tunnels , as we will see in proposition  [ prop : depth - efficienttorusknots ] .",
    "in addition to giving general bounds , the tunnel leveling addendum places very strong restrictions on the possible bridge numbers that can occur :    suppose that a knot @xmath25 has a tunnel @xmath26 produced by @xmath27 cabling operations , of which the first @xmath21 produce simple or semisimple tunnels .",
    "then @xmath28 is one of the @xmath29 values @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath32 is the _ fibonacci function _ of @xmath26 , defined in section  [ sec : fibonacci_functions ] .",
    "it appears almost certain that all @xmath29 possible values in the bridge number set theorem do occur as bridge numbers .",
    "as explained in remark  [ rem : bridge_number_set ] , this is easy to see for @xmath23 and @xmath33 , but for the general case we have not been able to verify all the necessary examples .",
    "we will also examine the interesting case of the `` middle '' tunnels of torus knots . in our paper  @xcite , we calculated the invariants of  @xcite for all torus knot tunnels . using that information ,",
    "we will show that torus knot tunnels achieve the minimum rate of growth of bridge numbers in terms of depth , but not the minimum possible values , while they do achieve the maximum possible bridge numbers in terms of the number of cabling constructions .",
    "here is an outline of the sections of the paper .",
    "the first two sections constitute a concise review of the material from  @xcite that we will need for the present applications .",
    "section  [ sec : ddd ] introduces the distance and depth invariants , and gives a few results that follow quickly from  @xcite and work of other authors .",
    "section  [ sec : tunnel_leveling ] reviews the tunnel leveling theorem , and section  [ sec : efficient ] states and proves the tunnel leveling addendum .",
    "fibonacci functions are introduced in section  [ sec : fibonacci_functions ] , which also contains the more technical results on bridge number , including the bridge number set theorem .",
    "the minimum and maximum bridge number theorems are proved in section  [ sec : growth ] , and torus knot tunnels are studied in section  [ sec : torus_knots ] .",
    "finally , most of the results apply to the case of tunnel number @xmath0 links , and in section  [ sec : links ] , we briefly discuss these adaptations .",

    "an isotopy carrying this handlebody to @xmath34 carries a cocore @xmath9-disk of that @xmath0-handle to a nonseparating disk in @xmath34 , and carries the tunnel number  @xmath0 knot to a core circle of the solid torus obtained by cutting @xmath34 along the image disk in @xmath34 .",
    "the indeterminacy of this disk due to the choice of isotopy is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath35 that preserve @xmath34 .",

    "a @xmath9-simplex which has two primitive vertices and one nonprimitive is identified with some other such simplices , then folded in half and attached to @xmath52 along the edge @xmath56 .",
    "the nonprimitive vertices of such @xmath9-simplices are exactly the disks in @xmath36 that are disjoint from some primitive pair , and these are called @xmath57 disks . as tunnels , they are the upper and lower tunnels of @xmath9-bridge knots .",

    "it is a bipartite graph , with `` white '' vertices of valence @xmath61 represented by triples and `` black '' vertices of ( countably ) infinite valence represented by pairs .",
    "the valences reflect the fact that moving along an edge from a triple to a pair corresponds to removing one of its three disks , while moving from a pair to a triple corresponds to adding one of infinitely many possible third disks to a pair .",

    "two such @xmath5-curves in @xmath34 are isotopic in @xmath35 exactly when they are equivalent under the goeritz group , so the white vertices of @xmath43 give the isotopy classification .",
    "in a sentence , the cabling construction is to `` think of the union of @xmath25 and the tunnel arc as a @xmath5-curve , and rationally tangle the ends of the tunnel arc and one of the arcs of @xmath25 in a neighborhood of the other arc of @xmath25 . ''",
    "we sometimes call this `` swap and tangle , '' since one of the arcs in the knot is exchanged for the tunnel arc , then the ends of other arc of the knot and the tunnel arc are connected by a rational tangle . figure  [",

    "the principal vertex of @xmath69 is @xmath72 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the slope disk @xmath69 is chosen to be nonseparating in @xmath34 . a cabling operation using a separating disk as @xmath69 produces a tunnel number  @xmath0 link , and the cabling process can not be continued .",
    "this case will be discussed in section  [ sec : links ] .",
    "theorem  13.2 of  @xcite shows that every tunnel of every tunnel number  @xmath0 knot can be obtained by a uniquely determined sequence of cabling constructions . a tunnel @xmath59 produced from the tunnel of the trivial knot by a single cabling construction",
    "is called a _ simple _ tunnel . as already noted , these are the `` upper and lower '' tunnels of @xmath9-bridge knots . a tunnel is called _ semisimple _ if it is disjoint from a primitive disk , but not from any primitive pair .    a @xmath73-knot is a knot that can be put into @xmath0-bridge position with respect to a heegaard torus of @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a @xmath73-knot , whose heegaard torus splits @xmath35 into two solid tori @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "then @xmath76 determines a tunnel of @xmath25 ; the corresponding tunnel constructed in @xmath75 is the other one .",
    "tunnels arising in this way are called @xmath73-tunnels , and are exactly the simple and semisimple tunnels .",
    "a tunnel is called _ regular _ if it is not primitive , simple , or semisimple .",
    "there is a procedure for assigning rational slopes which record the rational tangle used in a cabling construction .",
    "we will not need these slopes in our study of depth , although we will include them , in an inessential way , in our discussion of the torus knot examples in section  [ sec : torus_knots ] , and they also appear briefly in remark  [ rem : bridge_number_set ] .",
    "the slope invariants are usually not needed for working with depth because the depth is completely determined by the second set of invariants associated to a tunnel , the `` binary '' invariants @xmath78 ,  @xmath79 , which we now define .",
    "we have already mentioned that for every tunnel @xmath26 , there is a unique sequence of tunnels @xmath80 , @xmath81 such that @xmath59 is simple and for each @xmath82 , @xmath83 is obtained from @xmath84 by a cabling construction . the cabling that produces @xmath83 retains one arc of the associated knot @xmath85 of @xmath84 , and replaces the other with a tangle , producing @xmath86 .",
    "the invariant @xmath87 is @xmath0 exactly when this cabling replaces the arc that was retained by the previous cabling , otherwise @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "a tunnel is simple or semisimple if and only if all @xmath89 . the reason is that both conditions characterize cabling sequences in which one of the original primitive disks is retained in every cabling ; this corresponds to the fact that the union of the tunnel arc and one of the arcs of the knot is unknotted .",
    "there are two formal definitions of the binary invariants .",
    "the first is in terms of the principal path @xmath55 , @xmath54 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where the @xmath94 are the `` black '' vertices , the @xmath95 are the `` white '' vertices , and @xmath96 : @xmath89 or @xmath97 according to whether or not the unique disk of @xmath98 equals the unique disk of @xmath99 .",
    "equivalently , each cabling operation begins with a triple of disks @xmath100 and finishes with @xmath101 . for @xmath102 , put @xmath97 if @xmath103 , and @xmath89 otherwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppath ] shows the principal path of a tunnel with binary invariants @xmath104 .",
    "having binary invariants @xmath104 , or equivalently with step sequence `` drrrdrdllldldrr''.,width=188 ]    from the viewpoint of a traveler along the principal path , @xmath97 means a change from making right turns ( at the white vertices ) to left turns , or from left turns to right , while @xmath89 means a turn in the same direction as the previous turn .",
    "let us say that a _ step _ of the principal path is a portion between successive white vertices .",
    "a principal path can then be described as a _ step sequence .",
    "_ this is a string of symbols `` l '' , `` r '' , or `` d '' , for `` left '' , `` right '' , and `` down '' as seen from the reader s viewpoint ( as opposed to the `` left '' and `` right '' of a traveler along the path ) . for the example of figure  [ fig : ppath ] , the step sequence is `` drrrdrdllldldrr '' . in general , the initial step of a principal path is always `` d '' , and the second step , due to the standard way that we draw the picture , is `` r '' .",
    "each subsequent step corresponds to a binary invariant .",
    "an `` l '' can only be followed by another `` l '' or a `` d '' , according as the corresponding binary invariant @xmath105 is @xmath88 or @xmath0 , and similarly an `` r '' is followed by another `` r '' or a `` d '' , according as @xmath105 is @xmath88 or @xmath0 .",
    "when the previous step is `` d '' , the effect of @xmath105 depends on the step before one that produces the `` d '' .",
    "if the `` d '' is in a sequence `` ld '' , then the next step is `` r '' or `` l '' according as @xmath105 is @xmath88 or @xmath0 , while if it is in `` rd '' , then the next step is `` l '' or `` r '' according as @xmath105 is @xmath88 or @xmath0 .    functions that translate between the binary sequence and step sequence descriptions are included in the software at  @xcite .",
    "the main functions there accept either form of input for principal paths .",
    "the _ ( hempel ) distance _",
    "@xmath7 is the shortest distance in the curve complex of @xmath49 from @xmath106 to a loop that bounds a disk in @xmath46 ( see j. johnson @xcite and y. minsky , y. moriah , and s. schleimer @xcite ) . it is well - defined since the action of the goeritz group on @xmath49 preserves the set of loops that bound disks in @xmath34 and the set that bound in  @xmath46 .    a nonseparating disk has distance @xmath0 if and only if it is primitive , since both conditions are equivalent to the condition that cutting @xmath34 along the disk produces an unknotted solid torus .",

    "since we always have @xmath322 , the bridge number is simply the value of @xmath282 .",
    "these obey the recursion of corollary  [ coro : cheapest_descent ] , starting with @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "since the cabling sequence for the middle tunnel @xmath26 of any torus knot contains only one two - bridge knot ( the @xmath301-torus knot produced by the first nontrivial cabling ) , there is no regular torus knot tunnel which has @xmath325 . since the other tunnels of torus knots are semisimple , the maximum depth of any tunnel of a torus knot is the depth of its middle tunnel .",
    "therefore each @xmath264 in this sequence gives the minimum bridge number for a torus knot with a tunnel of depth  @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a version of the minimum bridge number theorem  [ thm : minbridgenum ] for torus knot tunnels :    for @xmath10 , the minimum bridge number of a torus knot tunnel depth  @xmath1 is given recursively by @xmath326 , where @xmath327 , @xmath328 , and @xmath329 for @xmath15 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath330 and consequently @xmath331 .",
    "we note that @xmath326 is @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the lower bound in the minimum bridge number theorem  [ thm : minbridgenum ] .",
    "that is , the minimum bridge number of a torus knot having a tunnel of depth  @xmath1 is exactly half the minimum bridge number for all knots having a tunnel of depth @xmath334 , and is approximately @xmath335 times the minimum for all knots having a tunnel of depth  @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the middle tunnel any torus knot for which @xmath284 has an expansion @xmath336 $ ] will have a principal path as in the previous argument , since the first term in the continued fraction has no effect on the principal path .",
    "middle tunnels for which the expansion is not of this form will have different principal paths , so we can state the following result :    the slowest growth of bridge number compared to depth for sequences of middle tunnels of torus knots occurs when the @xmath284 have continued fraction expansions of the form @xmath337 $ ] . [ prop : depth - efficienttorusknots ]    by similar considerations , one can obtain the upper bound version .    the fastest growth of bridge number of torus knots per number of cablings of the middle tunnels occurs for sequences of tunnels @xmath198 of @xmath278 for which the continued fraction expansions of @xmath284 are of the form @xmath338 $ ] , where there are @xmath38 @xmath0 s . for these tunnels , @xmath339 has bridge number @xmath340 .",
    "[ prop : fast - growthtorusknots ]    for these tunnels , the terminal part of the corridor is like that shown in figure  [ fig : universal ] with @xmath23 . since there are exactly @xmath38 cablings in the cabling sequence of @xmath198 , these tunnels achieve the bridge numbers in the maximum bridge number theorem .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , our entire theory of tunnel number @xmath0 knot tunnels can be adapted to include tunnels of tunnel number @xmath0 links , simply by adding the separating disks as possible slope disks .",
    "the full disk complex @xmath341 is only slightly more complicated than @xmath36 .",
    "each separating disk is disjoint from only two other disks , both nonseparating , so the additional vertices appear in @xmath9-simplices attached to @xmath36 along the edge opposite the vertex that is a separating disk .",
    "the quotient @xmath342 has only three types of additional @xmath9-simplices :    1 .",
    "there is a unique orbit @xmath343 of `` primitive '' separating disks , consisting of separating disks disjoint from a primitive pair , which are exactly the intersections of splitting spheres ( see  @xcite ) with @xmath34 . in @xmath342",
    ", @xmath343 is a vertex of a `` half - simplex '' @xmath344 attached to @xmath42 along @xmath345 .",
    "it is the unique tunnel of the trivial @xmath9-component link .",
    "2 .   simple separating disks lie in half - simplices attached along @xmath346 , just like nonseparating simple disks .",
    "3 .   the remaining separating disks lie in @xmath9-simplices attached along edges of @xmath42 spanned by two ( orbits of ) disks , at least one of which is nonprimitive .    for the spine , a single",
    "`` y '' is added to @xmath43 for each added @xmath9-simplex as in  ( 3 ) , and a folded `` y '' for each the half - simplices as in  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) .",
    "the link in @xmath347 of a link tunnel is simply the top edges ( or top edge , for the trivial and simple tunnels ) of such a  `` y '' ( or folded `` y '' ) .",
    "the cabling operation differs only in allowing a separating slope disk , which produces a tunnel of a tunnel number  @xmath0 link .",
    "the cabling sequence ends with the first separating slope disk .",
    "thus the principal paths look exactly like those of the knot case , such as the one in figure  [ fig : ppath ] .",
    "the only difference is that no further continuation is possible if the final tunnel is the tunnel of a link .    for link tunnels ,",
    "the distance and depth invariants are defined as for knot tunnels .",
    "simple tunnels are",
    "the upper and lower tunnels of @xmath9-bridge links ( and are the only tunnels of these links , see @xcite , @xcite , or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 16.3 ) ) .",
    "depth  @xmath0 tunnels are the tunnels of links with one component unknotted .",
    "the other component must be a @xmath73-knot , and the link must have torus bridge number  @xmath9  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 16.4 ) .",
    "lemma  [ lem : johnsondistance ] holds when @xmath26 is separating , in fact the argument is an easier version of the argument in  @xcite , so theorem  [ thm : uniquetunnel ] and corollary  [ coro : amphichiral ] hold for links as well as knots .",
    "the tunnel leveling addendum extends to tunnels of tunnel number @xmath0 links , since the efficient cabling construction of section  [ sec : efficient ] works just as well in the link case .",
    "but the statement and proof are very much simpler , since only the level arc case need be considered .      using the tunnel leveling addendum for links ,",
    "the computational results of sections  [ sec : fibonacci_functions ] and  [ sec : growth ] hold as stated for tunnels of tunnel number @xmath0 links .",
