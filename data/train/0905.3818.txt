    "it is conventionally thought that the thermal x - ray components of neutron stars are originated from the initial residual heat when the stars cool  @xcite , even before the discovery of galactic x - ray sources and pulsars .",
    "however , we will focus on this old problem in the regime of quark stars since there is no clear observational evidence to rule out quark stars or neutron stars .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that the observed thermal emission of isolated pulsars could be well understood in a solid quark star model .",
    "the study of quark matter phases , both hot and cold , has been an interesting topic of research in recent years . in an astrophysical context",
    ", quark stars composed by cold quark matter have yet not been ruled out by the measured properties of pulsar - like compact stars  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been proposed that realistic quark matter in compact stars could exist in a solid state @xcite , either as a super - solid or as a normal solid  @xcite .",
    "the basic conjecture of normal solid quark matter is that de - confined quarks tend to form quark - clusters when the temperature and density are relatively low . below a certain critical temperature",
    ", these clusters could be in periodic lattices immersed in a degenerate , extremely relativistic , electron gas .",
    "note that even though quark matter is usually described as weakly coupled , the interaction between quarks and gluons in a quark - gluon plasma is still very strong @xcite .",
    "it is this strong coupling that could cause the quarks to cluster and form a solid - like material .",
    "in fact , various kinds of observations could put constraints on the state of the matter in a pulsar , and the cooling behavior is suggested since 1960s , even before the discovery of pulsars .",
    "can contemporary observations of x - ray thermal emitting and cooling pulsars be understood in the proposed solid quark star ( hereafter sqs ) model ?",
    "this is a question we try to answer in the paper , and we address that sqss could not be ruled out by the thermal observations .",
    "moreover , sqss might provide an opportunity to evaluate pulsar moments of inertia , if the thermal emission is also powered by spin .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that contemporary observations of thermal x - ray emitting pulsars are consistent with the assumption that these sources are in fact sqss .",
    "the present analysis and calculation will concentrate on the observational temperature range , i.e. a few hundreds of to a few tens of ev .",
    "nonetheless , a phenomenological scenario for the whole thermal history of a strange quark star is also outlined , as described in  2.1 .",
    "the stellar residual heat would be the first energy source supporting the x - ray bolometric luminosities of sqss .",
    " 2.2 is involved on this topic , including both of the partial contributions of the lattices and the electrons .",
    "other energy reservoirs could exist as the stellar heating processes .",
    "this will be discussed in  2.3 , where different heating mechanisms are introduced , according to the different x - ray pulsar manifestations . in  3 , we compare the observations and the predictions given by the sqs pulsar model .",

    "_ stage 2 _ : individual quark cluster phase . as the temperature decreases , individual quarks tend to form quark clusters because of the strong coupling between them",
    ". the state of the star could then be the fluid of quark clusters .",
    "_ stage 3 _ : solid quark star phase .",
    "as the temperature drops to a melting temperature , the fluid of quark clusters tend to solidify to form periodic lattice structure , such as bcc structure.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the cooling process of a quark star can be quite complicated to model when starting from the birth of the star .",
    "theoretical uncertainties make it difficult to predict the exact temperatures where phase transitions occur . for illustrative purposes , we present the following scenario where cooling of a quark star takes place in approximately three stages ( see fig . [",
    "fig : stg ] ) .",
    "the first stage occurs just after the birth of the quark star if its initial temperature is much higher than @xmath4 k ( 10 mev ) .",
    "the emission of neutrinos and photons will lead to fast cooling .",
    "hence , the star quickly enters the second stage where de - confined quarks begin to form quark clusters .",
    "as the temperature drops further , the fluid solidifies and the star is said to enter the third cooling stage or the sqs phase . here",
    ", quark clusters form periodic lattice structures ( e.g. the bcc structure ) .    it is uncertain exactly how long the star will spend in each phase , or even if it will ever enter all three states",
    ". if the initial temperature is just around @xmath5 k or lower , stage 1 may be short lived or even non - existent .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma could be strongly coupled at birth and quark - clusters could be present immediately after formation .",
    "it is even possible that the melting temperature of solid quark matter could be @xmath6 k or higher .",
    "hence , a quark star would enter stage 3 immediately .",
    "the mechanisms for the emission of thermal photons and neutrinos in each specific stage would be quite different . a hot quark star ( in stages 1 or 2 ) would be a good radiator for thermal equilibrium photons with energy more than @xmath7 mev @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the intense release of thermal energy would stimulate the generation and radiation of electron - positron pairs from the hot bare quark surface .",
    "the annihilation of the electron - positron pairs would generate the emission of photons inversely , and this plasma could be optically thick enough to produce a black body spectrum @xcite .",
    "the emission of neutrinos would be given rise to by the pair production process as well as the plasma process induced by the ultra - relativistic degenerate electron gas inside the star @xcite .",
    "the basic urca process would be another neutrino radiation component for stage 1 .",
    "when the star cools down and becomes solidified ( in stage 3 ) , thermal equilibrium photons ( usually soft x - ray ) could also be emitted from the bare sqs surface as free electrons transit in the levels of the energy bands of solid quark matter @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction as well as the interaction between electrons themselves might result in a metal - like spectrum .",
    "@xcite analyzed the spectrum of rx j1856 phenomenologically , and they did not conclude that there are significant differences between the metal - like spectrum and black body spectrum . hence , a black body thermal spectrum would be a good approximation for sqss .",
    "the neutrino emissivity of clustered quark matter is theoretically so far unknown .",
    "the pair production and the plasma process would also lead the neutrino cooling for sqss , if the stars enter the stage 3 at high temperatures , such as @xmath6 k. nevertheless , in the observational low temperature range @xmath8 k , the neutrino luminosity would be low enough so that photon cooling would be the dominant process for sqss .    in general , in the low temperature range ( @xmath8 k ) which is the case considered by the present paper , the sqss cool down by losing thermal photons , and the sources of the energy that enable the thermal emission are firstly the residual thermal energy of the stars and secondly the energy input caused by the processes of stellar heating . the energy relation would then be described as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stellar bolometric x - ray luminosity , @xmath11 is the release rate of the stellar residual thermal energy , and @xmath12 is the luminosity of stellar heating .          provided that the volume of a sqs is a constant , then the stellar residual thermal energy @xmath13 would only be the function of the stellar temperature @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the value in the star s local reference frame . the heat capacity of the star @xmath16 comprises of the partial contribution of the lattice structure @xmath17 and that of the degenerate electrons @xmath18 , or @xmath19 .",
    "following debye elastic medium theory , the characteristic of the lattice heat capacity of solid quark matter could be evaluated by debye temperature , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath23 is debye cut - off frequency ( i.e. the maximum frequency of the wave that could propagate in a medium ) , which equals debye wave number @xmath24(@xmath25 is the number density of classical particles , or quark clusters for solid quark matter ) times the average sound speed in the medium , i.e. @xmath26 . for a sqs , the average sound speed could be the light speed approximately .",
    "a linear equation of state , extended to be used for a quark star , indicates that the pressure @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass density of a quark star and @xmath29 is the speed of light .",
    "so an estimate could be @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the baryon number density of solid quark matter in the unit of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 is the baryon number density of normal nuclear matter and equals 0.17 @xmath34 .",
    "we consider @xmath35 could be the typical values for a sqs .",
    "note that in the following calculation in this paper , we will adopt @xmath36 , since the variation of @xmath32 between @xmath37 would not cause the results to vary in orders .",
    "@xmath38 is the number of valence quarks in a quark cluster .",
    "we may expect that @xmath39 , since @xmath40 if quark-@xmath41-like clusters are formed  @xcite , and @xmath38 could even be conjectured to be in the order of @xmath42 .",
    "debye temperature @xmath43 of a sqs is then @xmath44 k , which could be even higher than the temperature when a quark star is born .",
    "hence , the heat capacity in the low - temperature limit or the temperature - cube law , is applicable for the lattice in the third stage , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the heat capacity per classical particle ( or quark cluster when referring to the solid quark matter)@xcite .",
    "thus @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the total number of clusters in a star .    for the stellar electron gas ,",
    "those electrons distributed in the vicinity of the fermi surface will contribute significant heat capacity .",
    "the electron heat capacity would be evaluated by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of electrons in a star , and @xmath51 is the fermi energy of the degenerate electron gas . in the extremely relativistic case ,",
    "@xmath52 , in which @xmath53 is the number density of electrons . according to the calculation using the bag model , @xmath53 is typically chosen as one part in @xmath54 of the baryon number density of strange quark matter @xcite . in the 3 times nuclear density case , @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath51 is hence in the order of @xmath57 mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , the heat capacities of these two components are plotted . as can be seen",
    ", the electron heat capacity is much larger than that of the lattice .",
    "noting that it is really ambiguous about the melting temperature of a sqs , though we extended the calculation to 10 mev .",
    "we can now evaluate the cooling time scale for a sqs , if the star is only powered by its residual thermal energy .",
    "we choose the stellar mass of 1.4@xmath58 as a typical case .",
    "we then have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the local stellar radius , @xmath61 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . on the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : timesl ] ) , the first energy loss component origins from the radiation of thermal photons , the second and the third terms are the neutrino luminosities induced by the pair production and the interior ultra - relativistic electrons , respectively .",
    "the calculation about these two neutrino luminosities refers to the analytic formulae given by @xcite .",
    "the concerning about the high temperature here makes the consideration on the neutrino cooling necessary .",
    "although the actual neutrino emissivity of clustered quarks is hitherto unknown , these two components of neutrino emission could really take place for a sqs .",
    "thus , one could obtain an upper bound on the residual - heat - powered cooling time scale for a sqs via equation ( [ eq : timesl ] ) .",
    "the calculation showed that a 1.4@xmath58-sqs could only be sustained in @xmath6218 d , when it cools down from @xmath5 k to @xmath54 k. this would be the intrinsic distinction for sqss from neutron stars .",
    "neutron star cooling is mainly residual thermal energy powered , while thermal x - ray emission and cooling processes of sqss could however be sustained by heating processes .",
    "heating processes may play a significant role in the thermal evolution or the visibility of pulsars in the soft x - ray band .",
    "pulsars with different magnetospheric properties may be undergoing different heating mechanisms .",
    "luminous nonthermal radiation and bright pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , these observational manifestations may imply active magnetospheres .",
    "strong star wind or relativistic particle flow would be ejected from the poles of such a pulsar .",
    "a certain amount of backflow of such plasma induce the stellar heating , or an energy input could take place at the polar caps and disperse to the bulk of the star @xcite .",
    "the heat flow @xmath63 could thus be @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the radius and the surface temperature of the polar caps in the local reference frame respectively .",
    "we adopted the one - dimensional approximation for the gradient of temperature , i.e. @xmath67 . the luminosity of the return - current stellar heating @xmath12 could be a function of the spin energy loss rate @xmath68 and could generally be in the form of a power law .",
    "moreover , a phenomenological study on the bolometric luminosity and @xmath68 reveals that the power index could be 1/2 or 1 , namely @xmath69 or @xmath70 ( see appendix a for the details ) .",
    "the metal - like interior of a sqs could imply that its thermal conductivity @xmath71 could be the sum of the partial components of phonons , electrons , and static impurities , or @xmath72 where the subscripts ` p ' , ` e ' , and ` imp ' denote the partial components mentioned above , respectively",
    ". the electron thermal conductivity @xmath73 could be the dominant component for the metal - like solid material @xcite .",
    "so phonon contribution @xmath74 would be neglected , and , as a preliminary model , we omit the partial component of static impurities .",
    "the electron thermal conductivity would be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the partial component contributed by the collision between electrons , while @xmath77 is that contributed by the collision between phonons and electrons .",
    "for their analytic formulae , we refer to @xcite with assuming that the results remain hold for sqss .      some pulsars ,",
    "showing steady long - term soft x - ray fluxes , being inert in nonthermal emission , lacking the proves on the existences of the associated pwne , ( and sometimes ) owning excesses of x - ray luminosities relative to the spin energy loss rates , could alternatively be inactive pulsar candidates .",
    "due to their little magnetospheric manifestations , sqss will not suggest the thermal x - ray radiation of these sources is of spin origin .",
    "one possible way to understand the origin of the energy is the accretion in the _ propeller _ regime .",
    "in this regime , a shell of atmosphere of matter may form surrounding the star .",
    "matter closing to the inner boundary of the shell may interact directly with the rotating stellar magnetosphere , as a result of which most of the matter will be expelled outward @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a certain fraction of the accreting material , described by the accretion efficiency @xmath78 , may diffuse starward and fall onto the surface of the star finally . in the propeller regime , the stellar magnetosphere radius or alfvn radius @xmath79 would be on one hand larger than its corotation radius @xmath80 , but is on the other hand somewhat smaller than the light cylinder radius @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gravitational constant , @xmath84 , @xmath60 , and @xmath85 are the stellar mass , radius , and the magnetic strength at the poles , respectively",
    ". the accretion rate @xmath86 could be scaled by eddington accretion rate @xmath87 ; so @xmath88 could denote the accretion rate in this unit , i.e. @xmath89 . during the accretion of the material which can reach the stellar surface eventually",
    ", the energy of gravitation would be released .",
    "furthermore , when the two - flavor baryonic matter impact upon the surface of a sqs , it will burn into the three - flavor strange quark matter phase , and the latent heat of @xmath90 mev  @xmath91 mev per baryon could be released in the phase transition @xcite .",

    "a linkage between pulsar rotational kinetic energy loss rates and bolometric x - ray luminosities is explored by sqss ( see appendix a ) , and the resulting estimates on pulsar moments of inertia is exhibited in table [ tab : moi ] .",
    "we hence conclude that the phenomenological sqs pulsar model could not be ruled out by the thermal observations on x - ray isolated pulsars , though a full depiction on the thermal evolution for a quark star in all stages could hardly be given nowadays , as the lack of the physics in some extreme conditions ( as has been discussed in  2.1 ) .",
    "sqss have significant distinguishable interiors with neutron stars , but the structures of the magnetosphere between these two pulsar models could be similar .",
    "therefore , sqss and neutron stars would have similar heating mechanisms , such as the bombardment by backflowing particles and the accretion to surrounding medium .",
    "however , a full comparison between sqss and neutron stars including their cooling processes as well as the heating mechanisms has beyond the scope of this paper , and should be interesting and necessary in the future study .",
    "the various performances of x - ray pulsars may indicate their current states or properties and imply their possible evolutionary history .",
    "in addition , if these x - ray sources are actually sqss , the possible formation mechanism could be an interesting topic .",
    "we thus extend a discussion in  4.3 .",
    "spin has always been a significant energy source for active pulsars , by which multiwave bands nonthermal radiation are driven , including those of the pulsar themselves as well as those of the surrounding plerions .",
    "some phenomenological studies demonstrate certain regularities for such an active pulsar population .",
    "a brief summary is that the nonthermal x - ray luminosity and spin energy loss rate own a relation of @xmath255 @xcite , and the @xmath256-ray luminosity is proportional to the square root of @xmath68 or @xmath257 @xcite .",
    "we , additionally , note that @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the potential drop along the open field region .",

    "xdins and ccos could be representative populations of magnetosphere - inactive pulsars .",
    "nevertheless , their energy origin that could power the x - ray emission is still an enigma .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of 1e 1207.4 - 5209 , rx j1856.5 - 3754 and rx j0720.4 - 3125 exceed their spin energy loss rates by a factor of @xmath261 , @xmath262 and @xmath263 , respectively ; they appear not to be powered by spins .",
    "ccos could be a group of weakly - magnetized and long - initial - period pulsars @xcite , because of which their potential drops along the open field lines could be much less than @xmath264 v , so that the primary plasma could not be fully accelerated , resulting in inactive magnetospheres .",
    "the black body fits to the thermal spectra of ccos always result in extremely small emission sizes @xcite , implying the possible existence of low - mass sqss .",
    "therefore , the @xmath68 of ccos might be very low , so that effective magnetospheric emission and plerions could not be driven .",
    "ccos could thus be the representatives of a group of natal inactive pulsars .",
    "accretion to the fallback ejecta of the associated snrs could power their soft x - ray luminosities , and this scenario have been mentioned by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "xdins , owning comparatively larger spindown ages and stronger magnetic fields , might be the descendants of magnetars . considering similar properties between them @xcite",
    ", one could not exclude that xdins are still being powered by the decaying magnetic fields .",
    "however , observations have revealed the probable existence of residual disks around such pulsars , and thus their radiation may be of accretion origin @xcite . in this case",
    ", xdins could be the evolved products of active pulsars , and thanks to the accretion so that they are still visible after their death .",
    "most xdins have absorption features in their spectra , being similar to those of ccos . hence ,",
    "if they are really undergoing accretion in the propeller regime , their spindown rates @xmath265 could then be of accretion origin rather than causing by the magnetic dipole braking .",
    "thus their magnetic fields could be much lower than the values determined by canonical magnetic dipole radiation , since the absorption features could be electron cyclotron lines .",
    "therefore , the common properties of absorption features between xdins and ccos could imply that xdins might be older ccos .",
    "xdins and ccos have not manifested themselves as radio pulsars , their radio - quiet demonstrations could be an intrinsic property rather than being of beaming origin , since they might be dead or natal inactive pulsars .",
    "so they could be grouped as radio - quiescent pulsars . for rx j0007.0 + 7303 , an active pulsar candidate , its lack of radio signal could be the result of an unfavorable geometry , or its radio beam sweeps away from the earth as has been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the similar thermal manifestations of accreting pulsars ( e.g. xdins and ccos ) and cooling pulsars may have caused a confusion about distinguishing between the two classes @xcite .",
    "however , the activeness of the magnetosphere could provide a way to achieve an identification .",
    "if pulsars are in fact sqss with rapid rotation , cooling pulsars are then likely to be undergoing the spindown - powered heating evolution , and multi - bands nonthermal emission originating from luminous magnetospheres and even pwne will accompany such coolers during the processes . in contrast , accreting pulsars may have not demonstrated such characteristics observationally . in this context",
    ", the cco in the snr cassiopeia a ( source no . 19 in table [ tab : data ] ) should be an accretor because of the lack of pwn and nonthermal power - law component @xcite .",
    "possible low - mass compact stars is a direct consequence of the suggestion that pulsars could be quark stars  @xcite",
    ". however , the probable existence of quark stars , spanning large mass range , could naturally raise such a question : how did these stars be created ? indeed , this could be another severe problem given by the observations .",
    "being different from solar - mass quark stars ( which could originate from core - collapse supernovae ) , low - mass quark stars could be the central remnants left by the detonation of the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite .",
    "the combustion from the hadronic matter to the strange quark matter could be the engine of such an explosion . during this phase transition ,",
    "as high as @xmath266 mev per baryon could be released as the latent heat @xcite .",
    "the combustion could hence be in such a high efficiency that % 10 of the rest mass is liberated . for a wd approaching the chandrasekhar limit ,",
    "its mass and radius are @xmath267 , @xmath268 cm respectively .",
    "the gravitational energy is then @xmath269 ergs . for a successful explosion of such a wd , the necessary mass of a quark star @xmath270",
    "would hence be obtained by @xmath271 as @xmath272 .",
    "so , in this case , low - mass quark stars with a few tenth of or a few hundredth of solar mass could form , although one should be aware that the exact value of the quark star mass depends on the region where the detonation wave inside the wd can sweep though as well as the latent heat of the phase transition , which would be strongly model - dependent . these nascent quark stars would keep bare if they has not suffered massive super - eddington accretion @xcite . an accreted ion ( e.g. a proton ) should gain enough kinetic energy to penetrate the coulomb barrier of a quark star with mass @xmath273 and radius @xmath274 , or @xmath275 .",
    "the coulomb barrier @xmath276 is model - dependent , which could varies from @xmath7 mev to even @xmath277 mev @xcite . considering @xmath278 for low - mass quark stars , a mass lower - limit @xmath279",
    "would then be determined as @xmath280 where the density @xmath281 , with @xmath282 the nuclear density , and @xmath283 mev .",
