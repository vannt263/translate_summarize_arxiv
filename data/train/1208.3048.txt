    "in addition , gaia s data will revolutionise many other areas of ( astro)physics , e.g. , stellar structure and evolution , stellar variability , double and multiple stars , solar - system bodies , fundamental physics , and exo - planets . during its five - year lifetime",
    ", gaia will survey the full sky and repeatedly observe the brightest 1,000 million objects , down to @xmath19 magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gaia s science data comprises absolute astrometry , broad - band photometry , and low - resolution spectro - photometry .",
    "medium - resolution spectroscopic data will be obtained for the brightest 150 million sources , down to @xmath20 magnitude .",
    "the final gaia catalogue , due in @xmath0@xmath21 , will contain astrometry ( positions , parallaxes , and proper motions ) with standard errors less than @xmath22  micro - arcsecond ( @xmath6as , @xmath6as  yr@xmath7 for proper motions ) for stars brighter than @xmath23 magnitude , @xmath24as for stars at @xmath25 magnitude , and @xmath26as at magnitude 20 .",
    "milli - magnitude - precision photometry allows to get a handle on effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , and reddening of all stars @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic data allows the determination of radial velocities with errors of @xmath27 at the bright end and @xmath28 at magnitude 17 @xcite as well as astrophysical diagnostics such as effective temperature and metallicity for the brightest few million objects .",
    "clearly , these performances will only be reached with a total of five years of collected data and only after careful calibration .",
    "intermediate releases of the data  obviously with lower quality and/or reduced contents compared to the final catalogue  are planned , the first one around two years after launch , which is currently foreseen for the second half of 2013 . the hundred - thousand - proper - motion ( htpm ) project @xcite , conceived and led by franois mignard at the observatoire de la cte dazur , is part of the first intermediate release .",
    "its goal is to determine the absolute proper motions of the @xmath0@xmath1 brightest stars in the sky using hipparcos astrometry for the first epoch and early gaia astrometry for the second .",
    "clearly , the htpm catalogue will have a limited lifetime since it will be superseded by the final gaia catalogue in @xmath0@xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , the htpm is a scientifically interesting as well as unique catalogue : the @xmath023-year temporal baseline , with a mean hipparcos epoch of @xmath2 and a mean gaia epoch around @xmath3 , allows a significant improvement of the hipparcos proper motions , which have typical precisions at the level of @xmath29  milli - arcsecond  yr@xmath7 ( mas  yr@xmath7 ) : the expected htpm proper - motion standard errorsthe htpm proper motions will be limited in precision by the hipparcos parallax uncertainties , which are typically @xmath01  mas ( the typical htpm proper - motion standard error is hence @xmath30 ) .",
    "the first intermediate - release gaia catalogue is based on just @xmath0@xmath31 months of data , which is generally insufficient to unambiguously lift the degeneracy between proper motion and parallax for all stars .",
    "the underlying astrometric global iterative solution will hence be based on a two- rather than five - parameter source model , fitting for position @xmath32 at the mean gaia epoch only .",
    "the hipparcos parallax is hence needed to correct the gaia transit observations for the parallactic effect allowing to transform apparent directions into barycentric positions .",

    "* section 1.2.5 ) ) .",
    "a clear advantage of combining astrometric data from the hipparcos and gaia missions is that the associated proper motions will be , by construction and iau resolution , in the system of the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) , i.e. , the proper motions will be absolute rather than relative . in this light , it is important to realise that massive , modern - day proper - motion catalogues , such as ucac-3 @xcite , often contain relative proper motions only and that they can suffer from substantial , regional , systematic distortions in their proper - motion systems , up to levels of 10  mas  yr@xmath7 or more .",
    "it is a well - known geometrical feature , for instance already described by @xcite in @xcite , that for fast - moving , nearby stars , it is essential to know the radial velocity for a precise measurement and determination of proper motion .",
    "in fact , this so - called secular or perspective acceleration on the sky was taken into account in the determination of the hipparcos proper motions for 21 stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2.8 ) and the same will be done for gaia , albeit for a larger sample of nearby stars . clearly , the inverse relationship also holds : with a precise proper motion available , a so - called astrometric radial velocity can be determined , independent of the spectroscopically measured quantity ( see for a precise definition and meaning of [ astrometric ] radial velocity ) . with this method , determinedthese",
    "authors also describe two other methods to derive astrometric radial velocities , namely by measuring changing annual parallax or by measuring changing angular extent of a moving group of stars .",
    "the latter method also provides , as a bonus , improved parallaxes to moving - group members .",
    "the astrometric radial velocities for 17 stars , from hipparcos proper motions combined with astrographic catalogue positions at earlier epochs .",
    "although reached relatively modest astrometric - radial - velocity precisions , typically a few tens of km  s@xmath7 , their results are interesting since they provide direct and independent constraints on various physical phenomena affecting spectroscopic radial velocities , for instance gravitational redshifts , stellar rotation , convection , and pulsation . in our study , however , we approach ( astrometric ) radial velocities from the other direction since our interest is to determine accurate htpm proper motions which are not biased by unmodeled perspective effects . in other words : we aim to establish for which stars in the forthcoming htpm catalogue the currently available ( spectroscopic ) radial velocity and associated standard error are sufficient to guarantee , with a certain confidence level , a negligible perspective - acceleration - induced error in the htpm proper motion . for stars without a literature value of the radial velocity , we establish whether  and , if yes , with what standard error  a radial velocity needs to be acquired prior to the construction of the htpm catalogue .",
    "section  [ sec : xhip ] describes the available astrometric and spectroscopic data . the propagation model of star positions",
    "is outlined in section  [ sec : propagation_model ] .",
    "we investigate the influence of the radial velocity on htpm proper motions in section  [ sec : rv_influence ] and develop two evaluation criteria in section  [ sec : evaluation_criteria ] .",
    "we employ these in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] and give our final conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as source for the hipparcos astrometry and literature radial velocities , we used the extended hipparcos compilation catalogue ( cds catalogue v/137 ) , also known as xhip @xcite .",
    "this catalogue complements the @xmath39 entries with astrometry in the hipparcos catalogue with a set of @xmath40 spectral classifications , @xmath41 radial velocities , and @xmath42 iron abundances from various literature sources .",
    "the starting point for the xhip compilation was the new reduction of the hipparcos data ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cds catalogue i/311 ) , also known as hip-2 . realising that stars with multiple components were solved individually , rather than as systems , by @xcite for the sake of expediency",

    "* cds catalogue i/239 ) in those cases where multiplicity is indicated and where the formal parallax standard error in hip-2 exceeds that in hip-1 .",
    "this applies to @xmath43 entries .",
    "in addition , @xcite included the tycho-2 catalogue in their xhip proper - motion data . in the absence of tycho-2 proper motions , hip-2",
    "proper motions were forcibly used .",
    "when multiplicity is indicated , hipparcos proper motions were replaced by tycho-2 values in those cases where the latter are more precise . when multiplicity is not indicated , tycho-2 proper motions replaced hipparcos values if the associated standard errors exceed the tycho-2 standard errors by a factor three or more . in all other cases , a mean hip-2 ",
    "tycho-2 proper motion was constructed and used , weighted by the inverse squared standard errors ; this applies to @xmath44 entries .",
    "the xhip catalogue contains radial velocities for @xmath41 of the @xmath39 entries , carefully compiled by @xcite from 47 literature sources .",
    "the vast majority of measurements have formal measurement precisions , i.e. , radial - velocity standard errors ( @xmath45 measurements lack standard errors ; see section  [ sec : stars_without_radial_velocity ] ) .",
    "in addition , all radial velocities have a quality flag :    * an a rating ( @xmath46 entries ) indicates that the standard errors are generally reliable . *",
    "a b rating ( @xmath47 entries ) indicates potential , small , uncorrected , systematic errors . *",
    "a c rating ( @xmath48 entries ) indicates larger systematic errors , while not excluding suitability for population analyses . *",
    "a d rating ( @xmath49 entries ) indicates serious problems , meaning that these stars may not be suitable for statistical analyses .",
    "a d rating is assigned whenever : 1 .",
    "the radial - velocity standard error is not available , 2 .",
    "the star is an un(re)solved binary , 3 .",
    "the star is a wolf - rayet star or a white dwarf that is not a component of a resolved binary , or 4 .",
    "different measurements yield inconsistent results .    the majority of stars in the xhip catalogue ( @xmath50 entries to be precise ) have no measured radial velocity .",
    "all we can reasonably assume for these stars is that their radial - velocity distribution is statistically identical to the radial - velocity distribution of the entries with known radial velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_vr ] shows this distribution .",
    "it is fairly well represented by a normal distribution with a mean @xmath51  km  s@xmath7 and standard deviation @xmath52  km  s@xmath7 ( the median is @xmath53  km  s@xmath7 ) . the observed distribution has low - amplitude , broad wings as well as a small number of real outliers , with heliocentric radial velocities up to plus - or - minus several hundred km  s@xmath7 .",
    "a small fraction of these stars are early - type runaway stars but the majority represent nearby stars in the ( non - rotating ) halo of our galaxy . the bulk of the stars , those in the main peak , are ( thin-)disc stars , co - rotating with the sun around the galactic centre . in theory",
    ", the main peak can be understood , and also be modeled in detail and hence be used to statistically predict the radial velocities for objects without literature values , as a combination of the reflex of the solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest @xcite , the effect of differential galactic rotation @xcite , and the random motion of stars @xcite . in practice , however , such a modeling effort would be massive , touching on a wide variety of ( sometimes poorly understood ) issues such as the asymmetric drift , the tilt and vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid , mixing and heating of stars as function of age , the height of the sun above the galactic plane @xcite , the dynamical coupling of the local kinematics to the galactic bar and spiral arms @xcite , large - scale deviations of the local velocity field caused by the gould belt @xcite , migration of stars in the disc @xcite , etc . to model these effects , and hence be able to predict a more refined radial velocity for any star as function of its galactic coordinates , distance , and age ,",
    "is clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will come back to this issue in section  [ sec : stars_without_radial_velocity ] .",
    "let us denote the celestial position of a star at time @xmath54 ( in years ) in equatorial coordinates in radians by @xmath55 , its distance in parsec by @xmath56 , with the parallax @xmath57 in mas , and its proper - motion components in equatorial coordinates in mas  yr@xmath7 by @xmath58 .",

    "this , however , is what nature and gaia will do for us : the initial celestial coordinates correspond to the hipparcos epoch ( @xmath2 ) and the final coordinates @xmath70 , with @xmath73  yr , will come from the first gaia astrometry .",
    "the htpm project will determine the proper - motion components @xmath58 from known initial and final celestial coordinates for given time interval , parallax , and radial velocity .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to express the proper - motion components in a closed ( analytical ) form as function of @xmath55 , @xmath70 , @xmath57 , @xmath60 , and @xmath71 since the underlying set of equations is coupled .",

    "equations  ( [ eq : calpha])([eq : cdelta ] ) show that the perspective - acceleration - induced proper - motion error caused by a radial - velocity error does not depend on the radial velocity @xmath60 itself but only on the error @xmath139 .",

    "this choice does not influence the main conclusions of this paper : perspective - acceleration - induced htpm proper - motion errors are significant only for nearby stars whereas negative and low - significance parallax measurements generally indicate large distances .",
    "from the monte - carlo distribution of @xmath143 ( section  [ sec : measurement_errors ] ) , we want to extract information to decide whether the radial velocity available in the literature is sufficiently precise or not . for this , we develop two evaluation criteria .      the first criterion , which we refer to as the gaussian criterion , is based on gaussian interpretations of probability distributions .",
    "it can be applied to all stars but , since we have seen that distant stars do not have a gaussian @xmath143 distribution , but rather a distribution with tails towards large @xmath143 values ( figure  [ fig : hip8_tail ] ) , the gaussian criterion is unbiased , and hence useful , only for nearby stars . for these stars ,",
    "the monte - carlo distribution of @xmath143 is well described by a gaussian function with mean @xmath209 and standard deviation @xmath210 ( figure  [ fig : hip38_gauss ] ) .",
    "the equations derived in section  [ sec : principle ] by ignoring astrometric errors are easily generalised by recognising that both the radial - velocity error and the distribution of @xmath143 have gaussian distributions , with standard deviations @xmath211 and @xmath210 , respectively : @xmath212 \\color{black } > c\\ ] ] generalises to : @xmath213 \\cdot \\color{black } \\tilde{\\phi}\\left[{{\\sigma}\\over{2 \\cdot \\sigma_{v_r}}}\\right ] \\color{black } > c \\label{eq : c_gauss_original}\\ ] ] using equation 8.259.1 from @xcite , equation  ( [ eq : c_gauss_original ] ) simplifies to : @xmath214 \\color{black } > c , \\label{eq : c_gauss}\\ ] ] which correctly reduces to equation  ( [ eq : c_without_errors ] ) for the limiting , error - free case @xmath215 and @xmath216 in which the gaussian distribution of @xmath143 collapses into a delta function at @xmath217 , i.e. , @xmath218 .    for the example of hip@xmath165 discussed in section  [ sec : hip70890 ] , we find @xmath219  km  s@xmath7 and @xmath220  km  s@xmath7 so that , with @xmath221  km  s@xmath7 , equation  ( [ eq : c_gauss ] ) returns @xmath222 .    it is trivial , after re - arranging equation  ( [ eq : c_gauss ] ) to : @xmath223 ^ 2}}-{{\\sigma_\\sigma^2}\\over{4}}}\\color{black } , \\label{eq : sigma_vr_gauss}\\ ] ] to compute the required standard error of the radial velocity to comply with a certain confidence level @xmath150 . for instance , if we require a @xmath224 confidence level ( for a @xmath225@xmath152 result ) , the radial - velocity standard error of hip@xmath165 has to be @xmath18  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we finally note that equation  ( [ eq : sigma_vr_gauss ] ) correctly reduces to equation  ( [ eq : sigma_vr_without_errors ] ) for the limiting , error - free case @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "a limitation of equation  ( [ eq : sigma_vr_gauss ] ) is that the argument of the square root has to be non - negative .",
    "this is physically easy to understand when realising that , in the gaussian approximation , one has @xmath226 ( see section  4.4 ) , so that : @xmath227 ^ 2}}-{{\\sigma_\\sigma^2}\\over{4 } } \\geq 0 \\rightarrow \\tilde{\\phi}^{-1}(c ) \\leq { { \\varpi}\\over{\\sigma_\\varpi } } \\rightarrow c \\leq \\tilde{\\phi}\\left[{{\\varpi}\\over{\\sigma_\\varpi}}\\right]\\color{black}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , for instance , if a certain star has @xmath228 ( a @xmath229@xmath152 parallax ) , the gaussian methodology will only allow to derive the radial - velocity standard error @xmath211 required to meet a confidence level @xmath230 or lower .",
    "since the monte - carlo distribution of @xmath143 values is not gaussianly distributed for distant stars ( figure  [ fig : hip8_tail ] ) , the gaussian criterion returns incorrect estimates ; in fact , the estimates are not just incorrect but also biased since the gaussian criterion systematically underestimates the mean value of @xmath143 ( i.e. , @xmath209 ) and hence systematically provides too conservative ( small ) estimates for @xmath211 through equation  ( [ eq : sigma_vr_gauss ] ) . rather than fitting a gaussian function , we need a more robust estimator of the location and width of the @xmath143 distribution than the gaussian mean and standard deviation .",
    "this estimator is contained in the data itself and provides , what we call , the robust criterion .",
    "let us denote the individual values of @xmath143 derived from the @xmath195 monte - carlo simulations by @xmath231 , with @xmath232 .",

    "the robust criterion generalises the gaussian criterion .",
    "both criteria return the same results for nearby stars which have a symmetric gaussian distribution of @xmath143 values . in general",
    ", therefore , the robust criterion is the prefered criterion for all stars , regardless of their distance .",
    "before we can apply the gaussian and robust criteria , we have to decide on a target proper - motion - error threshold for each star ( i.e. , the location of the dashed horizontal lines in figures  [ fig : schematic ] and [ fig : hip70890 ] ) .",
    "we adopt as a general rule that the maximum perspective - acceleration - induced htpm proper - motion error caused by radial - velocity errors shall be an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted standard error of the htpm proper motion itself ( section  [ sec : threshold_discussion ] discusses this choice in more detail ) .",
    "the latter quantity has been studied by @xcite and can be parametrised as : @xmath234 & = & -227.8 + 122.1 \\cdot h - 20.39 \\cdot h^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 1.407 \\cdot h^3 - 0.02841",

    "as already discussed in section  [ sec : xhip_radial_velocities ] , the majority of stars in the xhip catalogue do not have a literature radial velocity .",
    "these @xmath50 objects are treated as stars with radial velocity , with three exceptions :    1 .   for each of the @xmath195 monte - carlo simulations ,",

    "but at least in principle this choice means that there is a finite probability to assign a halo - star - like , i.e. , large radial velocity in one ( or more ) of the monte - carlo runs .",
    "regarding the htpm project , the best choice for stars without known radial velocity is to use @xmath237  km  s@xmath7 , which is the median value of the distribution ( recall that the mean equals @xmath238  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "2 .   for the gaussian evaluation criterion ( section  [ sec : gaussian_criterion ] )",
    ", we use @xmath239  km  s@xmath7 from the gaussian fit to the distribution of all literature radial velocities .",

    "clearly , this approach ignores the broad wings of the distribution visible in figure  [ fig : all_vr ] as well as a small but finite number of halo stars and runaway stars with heliocentric radial velocities up to plus - or - minus several hundred km  s@xmath7 ( see section  [ sec : xhip_radial_velocities ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the gaussian criterion systematically returns an overly optimistic ( i.e. , too large ) confidence level @xmath242 for stars without literature radial velocity ( figures  [ fig : vrad_errors ] and [ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "this bias comes in addition to the bias for distant stars for which the gaussian criterion returns too conservative ( small ) estimates for @xmath211 ( section  [ sec : robust_criterion ] ) .",
    "3 .   for the robust evaluation criterion ( section  [ sec : robust_criterion ] ) , we do not make _ a priori _ assumptions except that the overall radial - velocity distribution of stars without known radial velocity is the same as the distribution of stars with literature radial velocity , including broad wings and outliers. we thus use equation  ( [ eq : original_robust ] ) in the form : @xmath243 where the probability @xmath244 that @xmath139 is contained in the interval @xmath245 $ ] is calculated as the fraction of all stars with literature radial velocities in the xhip catalogue which has @xmath246 $ ] ( recall that the median radial velocity equals @xmath53  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "we thus cater for the broad wings of the observed radial - velocity distribution ( figures  [ fig : all_vr ] and [ fig : vrad_errors ] ) as well as for the probability that the object is a ( fast - moving ) halo star , avoiding the bias in the gaussian criterion discussed in the previous bullet .",

    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : datafile ] ( appendix  [ sec : datafile ] ) , which is available electronically only .",
    "the run time for @xmath195 monte - carlo simulations is typically @xmath0@xmath247  s per star and processing the full set of @xmath248 xhip entries with significant parallaxes ( section  [ sec : measurement_errors ] ) hence takes about one day .",
    "figures  [ fig : confidence_level_histograms_gaussian_criterion][fig : confidence_level_histograms_robust_criterion ] and tables  [ tab : confidence_level_distribution_gaussian_criterion][tab : confidence_level_distribution_robust_criterion ] show the results for the confidence levels of the literature radial velocities contained in the xhip catalogue .",
    "we find , not surprisingly since perspective - acceleration - induced proper - motion errors are relevant only for nearby , fast - moving stars  which are relatively rare  that the majority of stars have confidence levels exceeding @xmath224 .",
    "this indicates that , at the @xmath224 confidence level , the available radial velocity is sufficiently precise or , for stars without literature radial velocity , that the absence of a literature radial velocity , and hence the assumption @xmath237  km  s@xmath7 for the robust criterion or @xmath249  km  s@xmath7 for the gaussian criterion , is acceptable .",
    "this holds for more than @xmath250 stars using the robust criterion ( table  [ tab : confidence_level_distribution_robust_criterion ] ) and more than @xmath251 stars using the gaussian criterion ( table  [ tab : confidence_level_distribution_gaussian_criterion ] ) . the large difference between the two criteria",
    "does not come unexpectedly :    1 .",
    "we already argued in section  [ sec : robust_criterion ] that the gaussian criterion is biased for distant stars , with distant meaning that the parallax probability distribution has an associated asymmetric distance probability distribution .",
    "for such stars , the gaussian criterion systematically underestimates the mean value of @xmath143 and hence returns too conservative ( small ) values for @xmath211 for a given value of the confidence level @xmath150 and too pessimistic ( small ) values of @xmath150 for a given value of @xmath211 ; 2 .",
