    "recently , due to experimental advances in coupling a dilute gas of bosons to a single mode of an optical cavity , many theoretical and experimental works have been performed in order to explore and explain the physics of such complex systems .",
    "bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) itself is a very rich platform which allows us to examine different properties of quantum systems such as quantum turbulence   @xcite , quantum chaos  @xcite and entanglement  @xcite .",
    "a bose - einstein condensate can also be used to study nonequilibrium dynamics and decoherence in finite quantum systems  @xcite as well as calculation of fluctuation indices for atomic systems  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if confined in an optical lattice  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates provide the possibility to observe solid - state physics processes , such as localization  @xcite , in these atomic systems .",
    "further uses of becs are exemplified in transport problems  @xcite , interaction driven instabilities  @xcite , stability of boson - fermion gaseous mixtures  @xcite , and raman pump - probe experiments  @xcite .    in a more complex setup , where a dilute condensate of bosons is confined inside a high - finesse optical cavity subject to external laser fields ,",
    "if the cavity mode and laser fields are far - detuned from the atomic transition frequency of the condensate atoms , system is in dispersive regime . under the dispersive regime conditions",
    ", atom - field interaction provides an optical lattice for the condensate atoms which affects their mechanical motion .",
    "on the other hand , the atoms cause a position - dependent phase - shift of the cavity mode . as a result ,",
    "the condensate - cavity system is highly nonlinear with nonlocal nonlinearities which give rise to a series of interesting physical phenomena such as self - organization of condensate atoms , cavity enhanced superradiant scattering , dicke quantum phase transition  @xcite and optical bistability .",
    "the nonlinearity caused by atom - filed interaction can be more effective  @xcite than the nonlinearity from atom - atom interaction , which itself can play crucial role in scattering dynamics of condensates  @xcite .",
    "the optical bistability , which is the focus of this article , has been studied in spinor becs @xcite and two - component bec with two modes coupled by a classical field @xcite . in a system consisting of single - mode bec in an optical cavity",
    ", a transverse laser pump has also been used to control the bistability of cavity photons induced by a parallel pump @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider a two - mode bec in a one - dimensional optical cavity , where two laser fields are applied to the system , one parallel to the cavity axis and the other one perpendicular to it .",
    "specifically we assume that the transverse pump is scattered to the cavity mode by condensate atoms in the raman scheme @xcite . under this condition",
    ", we examine the effect of transverse pump strength on the bistability of both mean cavity photon number and normalized population difference ( magnetization ) of the two modes .",
    "stationary state of cavity field and condensate wavefunction are obtained under discrete mode approximation ( dma ) which has been shown to be reliable for similar systems @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[model ] first the model for our system is introduced , then the hamiltonian of the system and equations of motion of cavity field and condensate are derived . using dma , we solve the equations of motion for the steady state of the system in sec.[results ] , where we show how mutual bistability of the mean cavity photon number and magnetization take place under certain conditions for laser field intensities and cavity - atom coupling strength .",
    "finally , we summarize our work in sec.[summary ] .",
    "we consider a condensate of @xmath0 atoms , each with two internal degrees of freedom , shown as states @xmath1 and @xmath2 and an excited state @xmath3 , in a one dimensional cavity along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the cavity has a single mode with frequency @xmath5 and is subjected to laser field with frequency @xmath6 , which is far detuned from the atomic transition , in directions parallel and perpendicular to its axis . if the transverse laser field interacts with matter through raman scattering ( fig .  1 )",
    ", then the full hamiltonian of the system will have following form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the frequency of transition between modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath9 are the interaction strengths of atoms in modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parallel laser field intensity is shown by @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity mode .",
    "the interaction of atoms with the transverse pump is shown by the raman scattering hamiltonian ( @xmath15 ) and has the following form    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the atom - pump and atom - cavity coupling strengths , respectively , and the hamiltonian is written without rotating wave approximation .",
    "after adiabatically eliminating the excited state @xmath19 and introducing @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the pump detuning from the atomic transition , one obtains    @xmath23    .",
    "right : two internal modes ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of the bec atoms are coupled by cavity field and laser field via the atomic excited state @xmath3 in raman scattering manner .",
    "both laser field and cavity field are detuned from the atomic transition frequency.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ] [ fig : raman ]    substituting ( [ eq : hraman2 ] ) into ( [ eq : h1 ] ) , moving to a rotating frame defined by the unitary operator @xmath24 , and ignoring two - photon processes result in    @xmath25    for the hamiltonian of the system where    @xmath26    here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the ascending and descending operators in the two - mode manifold and @xmath29 is the pump - cavity detuning . from equations ( [ eq : h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hsingle ] ) one can derive the heisenberg equations of motion for condensate modes and cavity field as follow    @xmath30    @xmath31    and    @xmath32    where we have introduced a decay rate @xmath33 for the cavity in ( [ eq : heisen - alpha ] ) . in order to obtain the equations of motion for the expectation values of field operators , we further simplify our system .",
    "since we work with a condensate of large number of atoms , we can safely treat the condensate as a coherent state and disentangle it from photons .",
    "we also neglect higher order correlations within the photon subsystem and use @xmath34 and @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . at the end , as far as we only deal with the intensities , we treat the photon as a coherent state as well . as a result , following equations of motion are obtained    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the real part of the cavity field @xmath42 .",
    "to solve the equations of motion derived in sec.[model ] for the steady state of the system , we employ discrete mode approximation .",
    "the ground state of the condensate , without any laser field , is a homogeneous macroscopic state with zero momentum , which we refer to by @xmath43 . above superradiance threshold",
    "one can assume that the condensate is fragmented to a symmetric superposition of the states with @xmath44 momentum due to the transverse laser field .",
    "on the other hand , since the cavity mode is excited by the parallel pump , absorption and emission of the cavity photons can excite the condensate to the superposition of states with @xmath45 momentum .",
    "therefore if we consider first order perturbation on the homogeneous wavefunction @xmath43 , following functions can be used as the basis for dma :    @xmath46    with @xmath47 being the length of the cavity ( condensate ) .",
    "now the wavefunctions of the two modes of the condensate can be expanded in this basis as follow    @xmath48    if we substitute these wavefunctions into the equations of motion of the two modes , by ignoring external potentials and atom - atom interaction , the equation of motion for the condensate wavefunction can be written in a compact form :    @xmath49x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    here @xmath56 is the recoil frequency .    to examine the equilibrium properties of the system , we set @xmath57 in ( [ eq : eom - alpha ] ) which results in    @xmath58    on the other hand , one can easily obtain the following alternative expressions for the integrals in the above equation    @xmath59    @xmath60    therefore cavity field @xmath42 and averaged photon number @xmath61 will read as    @xmath62    @xmath63     ( left ) and normalized magnetization @xmath64 ( right ) as functions of @xmath65 for different values of parallel pump strength @xmath12 .",
    "we remind that @xmath65 is proportional to transverse pump strength and atom - cavity coupling strength . in all plots",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     ( left ) and normalized magnetization @xmath64 ( right ) as functions of @xmath65 for different values of atom - cavity coupling strength @xmath72 . in all plots",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    here one should notice that if there is no transverse laser field ( @xmath74 ) then @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "as a result , there will be no transition between the two modes and if atoms are initially in the ground state @xmath1 , they will stay there .",
    "therefore expectation values of both @xmath77 and @xmath78 in ( [ eq : steadyn ] ) or , equivalently , the integrals in ( [ eq : steadyalpha1 ] ) would be zero and no bistability in the system is expected .",
    "the importance of the transverse laser pump could be predicted from the crucial role it plays in raman scattering hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand to better understand the contribution of parallel laser field in bistability , we remind that due to dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath42 , expectation values in numerator and denominator of ( [ eq : steadyn ] ) are functions of @xmath80 .",
    "to lowest order , we can assume that these terms depend on @xmath80 linearly .",
    "therefore ( [ eq : steadyn ] ) is a cubic equation of @xmath80 which in the case of @xmath81 has always a zero root .",
    "therefore , to avoid a zero root in ( [ eq : steadyn ] ) , we will consider cases where @xmath82 .    to obtain the mean cavity field @xmath80 for the steady state of the system",
    "we need to find the wavefunction @xmath83 in steady state .",
    "since @xmath84 is nonlinear due to the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath42 , we first solve it for @xmath85 and @xmath83 with a guess for the value of @xmath42 .",
    "then by substituting the resulting @xmath83 into ( [ eq : steadyalpha2 ] ) , a new @xmath42 is obtained .",
    "if this new @xmath42 is equal to the guessed value then the steady state is reached , otherwise we repeat the procedure , while using this new @xmath42 as the guess , until the steady state is attained .    in addition to the average photon number , in a system consisting of two - mode condensate , there is another quantity which reveals the nonlinear effects of matter - field interaction and that is the normalized population difference ( magnetization @xmath64 ) of two modes . in our system magnetization",
    "is defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the total number of atoms and is fixed .",
    "2 shows mean cavity field @xmath80 and normalized magnetization @xmath64 as functions of @xmath65 for different values of parallel pump strength @xmath12 . we have considered a condensate of @xmath88 atoms in a cavity with decay rate @xmath68 .",
    "the laser field is detuned from cavity mode by @xmath69 and from atomic transition by @xmath67 . in all plots ,",
    "atom - cavity coupling is assumed to be @xmath66 . as one can observe from these plots , the effect of parallel pump on widening the area of bistability is not monotonic . while increasing @xmath12 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 results in a wider interval of @xmath65 in which bistability happens , further increasing it to @xmath91 has the opposite effect .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 has larger impact on the width of the area in which bistability takes place than on the values of @xmath80 and @xmath64 in bistable region .",
    "the interesting point about this system is the fact that nonlinear effects of matter - field coupling result in bistable behavior of both matter and field , such that , bistability happens for magnetization of condensate atoms exactly at the same region of @xmath65 where @xmath80 has shown bistable behavior .",
    "moreover , it can be seen in fig .  2 that , in some points , two states not only with different values of magnetization but also with different signs of magnetization are stable .",
    "in the next step , to better understand the role of atom - cavity coupling on bistable behavior of the system , we keep the value of parallel pump strength @xmath12 constant and increase the strength of atom - cavity coupling .",
    "3 shows the average photon number @xmath80 and normalized magnetization @xmath64 as functions of @xmath65 for the same values of parameters used in fig .  2 but this time with @xmath73 and for three different values of @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , atom - cavity coupling has a significant effect on the width of the area in which bistability happens .",
    "more importantly , @xmath72 can change the distance between the two stable branches .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath65 itself is proportional to @xmath18 and therefore for a fixed value of @xmath65 , larger @xmath72 means smaller value for @xmath17 . as a result",
    ", increasing @xmath72 makes it possible to achieve bistability with smaller values and wider range of atom - laser coupling @xmath17 .",
    "in this work we developed an effective hamiltonian and equations of motion for a cavity - condensate system consisting of a two - mode bec in a one dimensional cavity , while parallel and transverse laser fields are applied to the system . under dma , simultaneous and mutual bistability ( multistability ) of cavity field and",
    "population difference ( magnetization ) of the two modes has been observed for different values of transverse and parallel pump strength .",
    "the system shows bistable behavior for quite wide range of parameters .",
    "moreover it has been shown that , with strong enough cavity - matter coupling strength , bistability happens between two states with different sign of magnetization .",
