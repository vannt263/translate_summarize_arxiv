    "for some time our knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the galaxy s population of individual planetary nebulae has been restricted by large uncertainties in their derived distances .",
    "@xcite suggests that the _ average _ uncertainty in the distances cited to galactic planetary nebulae is in the range 35 - 50% .",
    "others are less optimistic",
    ". such a large scatter may not be surprising , given that planetary nebulae exhibit various morphologies and span a large range in mass @xcite .",
    "in contrast , well - studied open clusters have distances and reddenings that are established to much greater precision , with distance uncertainties as small as 2.5% being possible @xcite .",
    "planetary nebulae established as members of open clusters are therefore a potential alternative means of calibrating their fundamental properties . with an inferred distance from cluster membership in conjunction with a planetary s angular diameter and expansion velocity",
    ", its true dimensions and age can be deduced .",
    "cluster membership has the potential for a more direct calibration of the core mass - nebular he , c , and n abundance relationship expected in planetary nebulae as a result of single star evolution with asymptotic giant branch dredge - up @xcite .",
    "planetary nebulae confirmed as cluster members would enhance their importance as calibrators for the shklovsky relation @xcite or other similar methods used to establish their distances @xcite . on a cautionary note ,",
    "significant improvement in such relationships may not be possible if the observed scatter is intrinsic .",
    "several factors conspire to reduce the probability of observing a planetary nebula associated with an open cluster .",
    "first , the effective sample of planetary nebulae includes a large number of objects that appear to populate the galactic bulge @xcite , according to catalogue statistics @xcite on their distribution along the galactic plane ( figure 1 ) , as well as their observed radial velocities @xcite .",
    "potential calibrators lying in nearby open clusters are greatly reduced in number when that population is excluded , although many spatial coincidences still exist @xcite .",
    "associated open clusters with ages of less than @xmath0 years ( @xmath1 ) are likely to be excluded , since stellar evolutionary models indicate that the end products of their evolved components are type ii supernovae explosions .",
    "current knowledge of stellar evolution suggests that the immediate precursors of c / o white dwarfs were planetary nebulae central stars that did not undergo core carbon ignition .",
    "in addition to a small sample size , the detection of an association between a planetary nebula and an open cluster is further hampered by the short lifetimes of planetary nebulae .",
    "models indicate that their main - sequence progenitors were stars of @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an upper limit of @xmath3 being possible for production of ne white dwarfs .",
    "the lifetime of the planetary nebula stage is very sensitive to initial progenitor mass and subsequent mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and varies significantly for main - sequence turnoff ages greater than @xmath0 years , with estimates ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 years @xcite .",
    "the most common age for nearby galactic open clusters is @xmath6 years ( @xmath7 ) , according to the catalogue compilation of @xcite summarized in figure 2 .",
    "that corresponds to a main - sequence turnoff mass of @xmath8 .",
    "the lifetime of planetary nebulae associated with such progenitors is of order @xmath4 years , essentially instantaneous on the galactic stage .",
    "it is of interest to note that many planetary nebulae with massive central stars are found in the field , which is populated by the remnants of dissolved open clusters .",
    "such clusters exceed the number of bound open clusters by a sizeable order @xcite , which suggests that , despite the short lifetimes of planetary nebulae with massive central stars , increasing the statistical sampling of possible spatial coincidences between planetaries and clusters may lead to successful detections .",
    "the usefulness of such surveys at extragalactic scales by @xcite and @xcite is therefore obvious : larger statistics dominate and planetary nebulae are readily discernable , as demonstrated by their success as standard candles @xcite .",
    "the success of the macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath9 ( mash ) survey @xcite in detecting large numbers of additional galactic planetary nebulae has also been extremely useful in revealing additional coincidences with galactic clusters .",
    "the discovery of planetary nebulae within globular clusters @xcite raises a pertinent point that must be considered . if we consider @xmath10 as a strict lower mass limit for the progenitors of planetary nebulae @xcite , then , for the ages assigned to globular clusters , corresponding to main sequence turnoffs of less than @xmath11 , one must invoke binarity ( mass transfer ) to resolve the resulting discrepancy . that supports the scenario of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who argue that a large fraction of observable planetaries may indeed stem from binary systems .",
    "consequently , if a planetary nebula / open cluster association is established , we must be aware of the possibility that binarity might negate possible predictions for progenitor mass on the basis of the cluster s implied age from its main sequence turnoff .",
    "in this paper we consider the possibility of cluster membership for a number of planetary nebulae that are located in close proximity to open clusters lying in their lines of sight .",
    "the often cited cases for planetary nebula / open cluster associations include the cluster and nebula designated as ngc 2818 , as well as a9 in ngc 1912 ( m38 ) and ngc 2438 in ngc 2437 ( m46 ) , but lesser known cases are also considered .",
    "lubos kohoutek has compiled an on - line list of suspected planetary nebula / open cluster associations , somewhat different from that given by @xcite , that is reproduced in table 1 . to that list",
    "we have appended a new case involving the planetary nebula m 1 - 80 and the open cluster berkeley 57 , and also consider two planetaries that may be outlying members of ic 2488 @xcite .",
    "table 1 includes , where available , a planetary nebula identifier tied to its galactic co - ordinates , along with information on the dimensions of the spatially adjacent cluster and the angular separation of the planetary from the cluster center .",
    "open clusters are generally larger than the obvious concentrations of stars comprising their core regions @xcite , so we list in columns 4 and 5 estimates for the nuclear radius , @xmath12 , and coronal radius , @xmath13 , of each cluster , where the two dimensions are tied to the definitions of @xcite based upon linear star counts .",
    "the cluster nucleus comprises the dense central region of a star cluster that is obvious to the eye , whereas the cluster corona is the much lower density outer region .",
    "information on both parameters is not generally available for most clusters , although estimates of cluster angular diameter given by @xcite closely match the diameters of cluster nuclei defined by @xcite .",
    "coronal radii can be 2.5 to 10 times larger @xcite , and the best means of estimating that parameter seems to be by scaling the large angular diameters for open clusters cited by @xcite , as described in the table footnotes .",
    "the last values are crude approximations at best , but at least provide a sense of scale for establishing if a planetary nebula s angular separation from a cluster is consistent with a _ bona fide _ spatial coincidence",
    ".    table 2 outlines the qualitative framework used to determine if the suspected associations are co - spatial .",
    "the primary criteria are the differences in radial velocity and color excess between the planetary nebula and cluster ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and the ratio of the estimated distances ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the following parameters are also considered : the apparent size of the objects , their angular separation , and galactic location . because of the large number of planetary nebulae lying in the direction of the galactic bulge noted earlier , there is a natural bias towards purely line of sight coincidences with open clusters for planetaries lying in that direction ( recall figure 1 ) .",
    "the interstellar reddenings of planetary nebulae cited throughout this study were usually derived from the standard constant of extinction , @xmath17 , via the following generic approximation : @xmath18 from @xcite , where @xmath17 is related to the logarithmic extinction at h@xmath19 .",
    "the resulting reddenings may be systematically higher than those for stars in the surrounding fields if there is inherent self - absorption by dust within the planetary nebulae themselves .",
    "reddening is not necessarily a strong criterion for a spatial coincidence .",
    "the spatial distribution of interstellar extinction near the sun @xcite is clearly defined , and indicates that the dust is concentrated in distinct clouds rather than more or less uniformly distributed along the galactic plane . between the dust clouds along some lines of sight are large gaps , of a kiloparsec or more , within which all stars share similar reddenings .",
    "small spatial variations in reddening can be attributed to density variations within the clouds themselves .",
    "the open cluster trumpler 31 was studied photographically on the _ rgu _ system by @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a cluster distance of @xmath21 kpc and a reddening of @xmath22 after transforming the data to the _ ubv _ system .",
    "the cluster is not an obvious concentration of stars on poss images of the field , and star counts are needed to assess its reality .",
    "a color excess of @xmath23 derived for the planetary nebula m 3 - 20 @xcite places it beyond @xmath24 kpc according to the extinction maps of @xcite . the estimated distance is @xmath25 pc @xcite , which , in conjunction with the reddening , small angular size , and galactic location towards the galactic bulge ( figure 2 ) , confirm the planetary nebula as a background object to the cluster trumpler 31 , which may not exist .",
    "berkeley 57 is an older cluster recently examined by @xcite , who derived a distance of @xmath27 pc , a reddening of @xmath28 , and an age of @xmath29 years ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the planetary nebula m 1 - 80 is located @xmath31 from the cluster , and is estimated to lie at a distance of @xmath32 pc @xcite with a reddening of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "reddening alone constrains the distance of both objects only to somewhere in the interval @xmath34 kpc @xcite , so the case rests mainly on the similarity of the distance estimates .",
    "star counts compiled from 2mass data ( figure 3 ) lead to an estimated cluster nuclear radius of @xmath35 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that the planetary lies only @xmath36 from the cluster center .",
    "it is therefore a potential member of the cluster corona , adding further interest to the study of its potential association with berkeley 57 .",
    "the next step would be to use spectroscopic observations of the many evolved cluster giants to establish the cluster s radial velocity , for comparison with the value of @xmath37 km s@xmath38 derived for m 1 - 80 by @xcite .",
    "various literature studies of the parameters for ngc 1912 ( m38 ) generated a wide range of distance estimates for the open cluster , the likely reason being the 0.4-mag .",
    "spread in color excesses for member stars .",
    "the cluster distance is @xmath40 pc @xcite when that is taken into account .",
    "an independent distance estimate was obtained using data from the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to construct a _",
    "j _ versus _ j  h _ color - magnitude diagram , shown in figure 4 .",
    "isochrones tailored specifically to the 2mass system were obtained from the _ padova database of stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones _ @xcite . a sub - solar metallicity solution ( @xmath41 ) provided the best visual fit , and",
    "is supported by the work of @xcite , who determined a cluster metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath42 , which corresponds to @xmath43 according to the relationship found by @xcite .",
    "the following relationships were adopted between extinction and color excess in the infrared and optical regions : @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the canonical distance modulus relation was reformulated and evaluated as : @xmath46\\ ] ] the results , displayed in figure 4 , yield a distance of @xmath47 pc , a reddening of @xmath48 , and an age of @xmath49 years ( @xmath50 ) , essentially confirming previous estimates of a low reddening and a distance near 1 kpc .    with regard to the planetary nebula a9 ,",
    "a distance degeneracy has emerged , with both nearby , @xmath51 pc , @xmath52 @xcite , and @xmath53 pc @xcite , and distant , @xmath54 pc @xcite , solutions being advocated .",
    "the planetary s large apparent diameter of @xmath55 , measured using the _ aladin _ environment @xcite , would seem to favor the nearer estimates .",
    "the extreme faintness of the central star @xcite and the large reddening of the planetary nebula , which implies a distance in excess of @xmath56 kpc @xcite for a9 , almost certainly place the planetary at a much greater distance than the cluster ngc 1912 .",
    "a radial velocity of @xmath57 km s@xmath38 is available for a red giant member of the cluster @xcite , but the radial velocity of a9 has not yet been measured .",
    "presumably it would merely serve to confirm that the two are unrelated .",
    "the location of the planetary nebula ngc 2438 relative to the open cluster ngc 2437 ( m46 ) is visually supportive of an association , given the planetary nebula s breadth , brightness , and proximity to the cluster core ( figure 5 ) .",
    "three estimates for the distance @xcite and reddening @xcite to the planetary nebula yield mean values of @xmath59 pc and @xmath60 .",
    "both are in general agreement with a zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and isochrone fit to 2mass photometry for m46 ( figure 6 ) that yields values of @xmath61 pc , @xmath62 , and an age of @xmath63 years ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "color excesses increase along this line of sight from @xmath65 to @xmath66 at distances beyond @xmath67 kpc @xcite , which confirms the distances estimated for both the cluster and the planetary nebula .",
    "the color excesses for both are also similar enough to confirm that they share the same space reddening .",
    "the case for a physical association therefore rests upon their space motions .",
    "early studies of the radial velocity of ngc 2438 and m46 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* citing measures by struve ) and @xcite indicated a difference of @xmath68 km s@xmath38 between the objects , which suggests that the pair constitutes a spatial coincidence only . a cluster red giant spectroscopic binary has an identical systemic velocity @xcite as that obtained for cluster dwarf members by cuffey ( see table 3 ) .",
    "however , @xcite rekindled interest in a possible planetary nebula / open cluster association when they found similar radial velocities for both .",
    "while it is conceivable that the early radial velocity measures for cluster stars , which were made from spectrograms obtained from the northern hemisphere , might be affected by spectrograph flexure or by the presence of spectroscopic binaries in the sample , it is noteworthy that the radial velocity measured for the planetary nebula is similar to more recent measures ( table 3 ) .",
    "if the radial velocity measurements of @xcite are reliable , then there is a good case for a physical association of ngc 2438 with m46 .",
    "but additional velocity measures are clearly needed to strengthen the case , given that proper motions may not provide a suitable test in this instance @xcite .",
    "the derived distances to the open cluster ngc 2453 are unsatisfactorily varied , as table 4 summarizes .",
    "field star contamination may be important in this case , given that the cluster main sequence is dominated by b - type stars , which also populate the puppis ob associations , and an extension of the perseus arm behind them @xcite , which lie along the same line of sight .",
    "the distances cited from two deep ccd studies by @xcite and @xcite are favored because the main sequence morphology is well defined .",
    "the latter study of ngc 2453 implies a distance of @xmath70 pc , a reddening of @xmath71 , and an age of @xmath72 years ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the parameters for the planetary nebula ngc 2452 generally agree with those of the cluster , although the cited distance of @xmath74 pc @xcite and reddening of @xmath75 @xcite might suggest that the planetary nebula lies foreground to the cluster .",
    "the reddening along this line of sight remains unchanged at @xmath76 for distances in excess of @xmath24 kpc @xcite , so the small difference in color excesses is not useful for distance discrimination .    with reference to available radial velocities , @xcite obtained a value of @xmath77 km / s for a cluster b5 star ideally positioned as an evolved main - sequence member in the cluster color - magnitude diagram . despite the large uncertainty in the velocity and the fact that the spectrogram displayed double lines ,",
    "the value is very similar to measures for the planetary nebula : @xmath78 km s@xmath38 @xcite , and @xmath79 km s@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "additional radial velocity measurements for established cluster members are needed to assess the viability of the case further , although existing data do not rule out a possible spatial coincidence .",
    "it is of interest to note that @xcite concluded that ngc 2452 was among the most massive planetary nebulae in their sample of @xmath80 .",
    "their argument was based on the abundance ratio n / o , which is a tracer of mass for the progenitor star via the dredge - up scenario .",
    "coincidentally , the cluster s young age also implies a massive progenitor of @xmath81 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the well known spatial coincidence of the planetary nebula ngc 2818 with its surrounding cluster is an example of a case that visually supports an association ( figure 7 ) .",
    "@xcite determined a distance of @xmath83 pc and a reddening of @xmath84 for the cluster , consistent with the parameters derived for the planetary nebula : @xmath85 pc @xcite , and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "equally encouraging are radial velocities from low dispersion spectra ( 230  mm@xmath38 ) by @xcite for two a - type stars in the cluster that yielded @xmath87 km s@xmath38 , compared with @xmath88 km s@xmath38 obtained for the planetary nebula .",
    "such evidence , in conjunction with the general agreement in distance and reddening , has been the basis for the conclusion that the two are associated .",
    "more recent results suggest otherwise .",
    "a comprehensive radial velocity study of stars in the cluster field by @xcite yields a cluster radial velocity from 15 red giant members of @xmath89 km s@xmath38 , while the radial velocity of the planetary nebula is established to be @xmath90 km s@xmath38 @xcite and @xmath91 km s@xmath38 @xcite , consistently smaller than the velocity of the cluster . the greater precision of recent estimates results in a velocity discrepancy of @xmath92 km s@xmath38 @xcite , implying a spatial coincidence rather than a physical association , as concluded by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted an extensive study of the planetary nebula vbrc 2 and derived a distance of @xmath94 pc and a reddening of @xmath95 .",
    "the values are consistent with the parameters found for the cluster ic 2488 by @xcite , who derived a distance of @xmath96 pc , a reddening of @xmath97 , and a radial velocity of @xmath98 km s@xmath38 .",
    "those values are smaller than the estimates of @xmath99 pc and @xmath100 obtained for ic 2488 by @xcite .    there may be a tendency to dismiss an association between the cluster and planetary because of their large apparent separation ( @xmath101 ) , despite the consistent correlation among the parameters .",
    "star counts of the field were therefore made using data available from the 2mass survey ( figure 8) .",
    "the data highlight ic 2488 s broad extent ( @xmath102 ) and indicate that the planetary nebula vbrc 2 lies within @xmath103 cluster nuclear radii . since cluster coronae",
    "typically extend anywhere from 2.5 to 10 times beyond their nuclear radii @xcite , and the coronae of star clusters in the outer galaxy are larger on average than those in the inner regions @xcite , it may be premature to dismiss a possible association based solely on arguments of separation .",
    "it is of interest to note that a large fraction of short - period cepheids , potential progenitors of planetary nebulae , fall within the coronae of their constituent clusters @xcite .",
    "a final decision on the case must therefore await a radial velocity for the planetary nebula , to assess its potential as a cluster member properly .",
    "published estimates for the parameters of the planetary nebula ngc 2899 imply a distance of @xmath104 pc and a reddening of @xmath105 @xcite , consistent with the parameters for ic 2488 .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocity of the planetary nebula to be @xmath106 km s@xmath38 , which differs slightly but only by slightly more than 2@xmath107 from the cluster value .",
    "ngc 2899 is in the same situation as vbrc 2 , since it also lies nearly as far from the cluster center , yet possibly within the corona .",
    "remeasuring the color excess and radial velocity of the planetary nebula with greater precision would help clarify the case for cluster membership .",
    "thus , while not conclusive , both candidates offer encouraging evidence .    the reddening along this line of sight becomes larger than @xmath108 beyond @xmath109 kpc @xcite , so the observed color excesses for the cluster and planetary nebulae imply that they are reddened by foreground dust clouds .",
    "reddening is therefore of little use for constraining the distances to the planetary nebulae .",
    "presumably radial velocities would provide a stronger test for a physical association .",
    "the open cluster lyng 5 has not been studied since its discovery nearly forty - five years ago , so its parameters are essentially unknown . for this study we examined the field and estimated a peak in star density by eye at j2000.0",
    "= 15:41:55 , 56:38:38 , and a corresponding nuclear radius measuring about @xmath111 . as a means of obtaining approximate values for its distance and reddening , data from the 2mass survey @xcite for objects in the field of the putative cluster nucleus were used to construct _ jhk _ color - color and color - magnitude diagrams for cluster stars . the color - color diagram ( figure 9 ) suggests that there is a sizable group of reddened late b - type stars in the field , presumably associated with the cluster main sequence .",
    "the implied cluster reddening , @xmath112 , corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "a simple zams fit was used to estimate the distance ( figure 10 ) , yielding @xmath114 pc .",
    "but the values cited are only preliminary , and still uncertain .",
    "a few cluster stars may be bright enough for spectroscopic follow - up , which might confirm the derived parameters .",
    "interestingly enough , the cluster main - sequence turnoff appears to lie roughly at b5 , implying an age of @xmath115 years ( @xmath116 ) , corresponding to masses of @xmath117 for cluster evolved components .",
    "the cited distance of @xmath118 pc @xcite to the planetary nebula eso 177 - 10 is marginally consistent with the value obtained for the cluster , but the color excess of @xmath119 for the planetary derived from several radio measurements @xcite indicates that it suffers from much heavier extinction .",
    "such a large reddening implies a distance in excess of @xmath24 kpc along this line of sight @xcite , lending support to the argument that the planetary nebula lies in the cluster background .",
    "radial velocities would likely confirm that this pair represents a spatial coincidence only .",
    "@xcite conclude that the planetary nebula kore 1 is in a highly excited state on the basis of nearly equal spectral intensities for he ii @xmath121 and h@xmath19 . according to the work of @xcite , who formulated a relationship between the temperature of the central star and the various emission line ratios , kore 1 is among a small percentile of planetaries with _ super - high _ temperature central stars ( @xmath122 k ) .",
    "a correspondingly high intrinsic luminosity , faint apparent magnitude for the nebula and central star ( near the sky survey limits ) , and a small apparent diameter ( @xmath123 ) for the associated planetary nebula suggest that it is probably much more distant than the cluster , which is nearby ( @xmath124 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "the pair appears to represent another case of a spatial coincidence rather than a physical association .",
    "@xcite concluded that the planetary nebula hefa 1 is probably not associated with the open cluster ngc 6067 , on the basis of an inferred reddening of @xmath126 @xcite , which is larger than that of the cluster .",
    "the large color excess implies a distance not much greater than @xmath12712 kpc , according to the run of reddening with distance along this line of sight @xcite . the cluster reddening is @xmath128 according to @xcite , and @xmath129 from @xcite , which places a similar constraint on its distance .",
    "@xcite find a distance of @xmath130 pc and an age of @xmath131 years ( @xmath132 ) for the cluster , so the only difference in parameters between the cluster and planetary nebula is the reddening , which is not an ideal test of membership in this instance .",
    "ngc 6067 is also statistically unique in that it hosts two cepheid members @xcite .",
    "there is consequently an _ a priori _ probability of detecting a planetary nebula associated with the cluster since short - period cepheids are potential progenitors of stars that produce planetary nebulae",
    ". a radial velocity estimate for the planetary nebula would help resolve the question of its possible cluster membership , since a cluster velocity of @xmath133 km s@xmath38 has been measured @xcite .",
    "the case for a potential physical association remains open .",
    "@xcite established that the cluster ngc 6281 is nearby with a distance of @xmath135 pc and a reddening of @xmath136 .",
    "the planetary nebula sa 2 - 167 , however , has a much larger color excess of @xmath137 , according to @xcite , which implies a distance in excess of @xmath24 kpc @xcite .",
    "one can also note the location of the planetary towards the galactic bulge .",
    "the reddening discrepancy alone indicates that the planetary nebula lies in the background of the open cluster ngc 6281 .",
    "a reanalysis by @xcite of photographic _ rgu _ photometry for the cluster basel 5 by @xcite indicates that basel 5 is relatively nearby with a distance of @xmath139 pc and a reddening of @xmath140 .",
    "conversely , the planetary nebula m 3 - 45 may be a member of the galactic bulge population @xcite , given its galactic longitude and large reddening of @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "as in the previous case , the large reddening discrepancy is sufficient to indicate that the planetary nebula can not be associated with the cluster .",
    "the list of potential spatial coincidences between planetary nebulae and open clusters presented in table 1 is only a partial listing of the spatial coincidences that exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "many of the objects in table 5 are deserving of further study , however .",
    "a noteworthy feature of both table 1 and table 5 is that there are very few planetary nebulae coincident with cluster nuclei , and even those cases may represent cluster coronal objects seen in projection against cluster nuclei .",
    "a sometimes overlooked property of milky way open clusters is that their dimensions and stellar content are invariably underestimated when gauged on the basis of stars populating their dense nuclear regions , which are oversampled in ccd studies .",
    "as noted in  2 , @xcite and @xcite find that open clusters are surrounded by low density coronae that contain the bulk of their member stars . by inference , that should include the bulk of cluster members that evolve into planetary nebulae .",

    "cluster cepheids in the large magellanic cloud exhibit an identical characteristic @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for the preference of massive stars and cepheids , and presumably planetary nebulae progenitors , to cluster coronae .",
    "a dynamical origin for coronal cepheids was proposed by @xcite , in which the greater frequency of stellar encounters in dense cluster nuclei ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in a higher frequency of close binaries and merger products there , the former , because of roche lobe overflow , being less likely to produce post - main - sequence stars capable of reaching supergiant dimensions .",
    "the same mechanism might explain the apparent shortage of planetary nebulae in cluster nuclei .",
    "an alternate explanation in terms of a radial dependence of jeans mass @xmath143 in proto - clusters was suggested by @xcite to account for the discrepancy with respect to massive stars .",

    "the duration of the cepheid phase varies widely from @xmath146 years for first crossings of the instability strip to @xmath147 years for higher crossings , an order of magnitude ( or more ) longer than the planetary nebula stage .",
    "there are @xmath148 known cluster cepheids with @xmath145 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so statistically one might expect only a few planetary nebulae to be members of open clusters , and a preference for cluster coronae would seem logical .",
    "the survey presented here appears to confirm such expectations .",
    "we have yet to establish a single physical association between a planetary nebula and an open cluster based on a correlation between their radial velocities , reddenings , and distances",
    ". however , further follow - up is indicated for a number of cases where the evidence is suggestive , namely m 1 - 80/berkeley 57 , ngc 2438/ngc 2437 , ngc 2452/ngc 2453 , vbrc 2 & ngc 2899/ic 2488 , and hefa 1/ngc 6067 , six of the thirteen coincidences considered .",
    "additional good cases may arise from closer examination of some of the other coincidences noted in table 5 , but most of the associated clusters are as yet unstudied , limiting further progress .",
    "almost all potential cluster planetary nebulae lie in cluster coronal regions , typically surrounding open clusters for which limited or no photometric data exist .",
    "the fact that very few galactic open clusters have been studied to the extent that both their nuclear and coronal regions are examined @xcite only compounds the situation .",
    "further progress requires not only new studies of our galaxy s many unstudied clusters , but studies of their coronal regions as well .",
    "spectroscopic observations of potentially - associated planetary nebulae would also be of value .",
    "we are indebted to the following groups for facilitating the research described here : the staff at vizier , webda , and the nasa ads service .",
    "we are particularly grateful to andre moitinho for sending us a copy of his cmd for ngc 2453 , charles bonatto for useful discussions on taking advantage of data from the 2mass survey , george jacoby for suggestions on preparing the text , gunter cibis for drawing our attention to the possibility that some planetary nebulae might be cluster members , and lubos kohoutek for compiling the list of suspected pne / oc associations that was the foundation for this research .",
