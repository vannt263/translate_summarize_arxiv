    "the technological aspects of high-@xmath3 superconductors in strong magnetic fields and especially of their ability to preserve superconductivity by flux pinning @xcite have led to intense theoretical studies of the properties of a flux line array in a type - ii superconductor with random point - like pinning centers @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite that the flux lines in a superconductor with point disorder form a new thermodynamic phase , the vortex glass phase .",
    "it is supposed that in this phase the flux lines are collectively pinned by the point defects and energy barriers between different metastable states of the flux line array occur which diverge with increasing length scale @xmath4 leading to a glassy dynamics and zero linear resistivity @xcite .",
    "but there is still too little conclusive evidence to confirm this scenario by analytic means .    due to the absence of topological defects",
    "@xcite in @xmath5 dimensions , the planar @xmath5-dimensional flux line array can be well treated analytically in an elastic approach .",
    "actually , the system of flux lines in a type - ii superconducting plane with parallel magnetic field and point disorder is the only system for which the existence of a vortex glass phase has been shown analytically @xcite by applying various different methods .    on the other hand , the predictions for important physical features of the disordered @xmath5 dimensional flux line array obtained by the different analytical methods differ significantly . in particular , there are still many competing conjectures concerning the correlations in the vortex glass phase .",
    "moreover , the results of numerical simulations confirm neither of the analytical predictions @xcite .",
    "essentially three analytic approaches have been applied to the problem : ( i ) after using the replica trick and mapping onto a 2d xy - model with random anisotropy but without vortices @xcite , a renormalization group ( rg ) calculation @xcite has been carried out with the replicated hamiltonian not taking into account the possibility of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "( ii ) the replicated hamiltonian has also been studied by a variational treatment admitting of continuous rsb finding that a one - step breaking is realized @xcite .",
    "( iii ) without making use of the replica trick , the corresponding kinetic equation has been treated by a dynamical rg analysis @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we want to study how the concept of rsb could enter into a rg analysis . for this purpose",
    "we map the disordered planar flux line array onto the 2d xy - model with random anisotropy and perform a rg calculation with the replicated hamiltonian where we generalize the set of coupling constants such that we can take into account a one - step rsb .",
    "our aim is to show that an instability with respect to one - step rsb can also be found in the rg treatment .",
    "this leads to a more unified view of the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) , and results obtained by the variational approach can partly be reproduced in our calculation .    on scales larger than the flux line distance @xmath6 the planar flux line array",
    "is described by an elastic model with the positions of the flux lines given by a scalar transverse displacement field @xmath7 .",
    "the field @xmath8 itself can be regarded as a phase field giving the phase shift of the superconducting phase caused by the flux line displacements , because an increase in the flux line displacement by @xmath6 induces a shift of @xmath9 in the field @xmath8 . on large length scales ,",
    "the planar flux line array interacting with the random pinning centers can then be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath10 = \\int d^2{\\bf r }    \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}k(\\nabla\\phi)^2     + v_{1}({\\bf r})\\sin(2\\phi({\\bf r}))+v_{2}({\\bf r})\\cos(2\\phi({\\bf r } ) )   \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the second term containing the random potential @xmath11 with zero average and short range correlations ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 models the interaction of the flux lines with the point disorder in the continuum description ( @xmath14 includes a factor @xmath15 ) .",
    "the function @xmath16 is a delta - like function of the small width @xmath17 given by the maximum of the flux line core radius and the impurity size .",
    "a crucial feature of this term is to respect the periodicity of the lattice , i.e.  it is invariant under a uniform shift @xmath9 of the field @xmath8 . by rescaling of one coordinate the isotropic first term for the elastic energy is obtained with one elastic constant k ( including a factor @xmath18 ) .",
    "each of the three approaches sketched above @xcite as well as the numerical simulation @xcite , yield a phase transition at @xmath19 or @xmath20 with @xmath21 which serves as a small parameter measuring the distance from the transition and controlling expansions around the transition .",
    "for @xmath22 the system is in a high - temperature phase , disorder is not relevant and does not alter the correlations induced by thermal fluctuations on large length scales @xmath23 .",
    "however , the results concerning the correlations for @xmath24 in the glassy phase differ significantly . the rg analysis carried out on the replica hamiltonian in a replica symmetric way yields correlations @xmath25 at large length scales",
    "@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the same result is obtained in the dynamical rg calculation @xcite .",
    "besides , correlations diverging like the square of the logarithm follow from a real - space rg procedure @xcite . on the other hand , in the variational approach with one - step rsb , correlations @xmath27 are found @xcite to diverge logarithmically but with a prefactor increasing with decreasing temperature .",
    "logarithmically diverging correlations have also been found in the numerical simulation @xcite but the prefactor of the logarithm does not accord with the analytical prediction in @xcite . our calculation including one - step rsb in the rg analysis of the replicated hamiltonian can reproduce both correlations diverging with a simple logarithm and correlations diverging with the square of the logarithm depending on the choice of the block size parameter @xmath0 in the one - step rsb scheme .",
    "introducing @xmath28 replicas and averaging over the disorder gives the effective replicated hamiltonian ( with replica indices @xmath29,@xmath30 running from 1 to n ) @xmath31 = \\int d^2{\\bf r }    \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta } k_{\\alpha\\beta }   \\nabla\\phi_{\\alpha } \\cdot \\nabla\\phi_{\\beta } -    \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta } g_{\\alpha\\beta } \\cos{(2(\\phi_{\\alpha}-\\phi_{\\beta } ) ) }   \\right\\}\\ ] ] with matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 taking on their bare values @xmath34 this hamiltonian is equivalent to the replica hamiltonian of a 2d xy - model with random anisotropy but without vortices @xcite .",
    "the variational studies allowing for continuous rsb performed so far on this hamiltonian @xcite have shown that in the 2-dimensional model considered here a one - step rsb is realized .",
    "our calculation is restricted so far to a one - step rsb scheme but the results from the variational approach suggest that our results may stay valid even if it is possible to extend the calculation to higher steps of rsb or a continuous rsb scheme .",
    "introducing one - step rsb and following the resulting rg flow , it is necessary to admit matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the form @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; the elements of the matrix @xmath37 are 1 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 belong to the same block of size @xmath0 and 0 otherwise . because of ( [ 4a ] ) , ( [ 4b ] ) we have initially @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . to derivate the full rg flow equations , we perform an analysis technically similar to that of cardy and ostlund @xcite but with significant extensions to take into account the one - step rsb .",
    "the calculation is based on the mapping onto a coupled coulomb gas .",
    "we want to consider only weak disorder , so initially the disorder strength @xmath14 will be small ; also throughout the rg procedure the matrix elements of @xmath33 stay sufficiently small to use standard methods @xcite to transform the cos - couplings in the partition sum and to integrate out the fields @xmath41 in favour of integer charges @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) with fugacity @xmath33 .",
    "the replicated disorder averaged partition sum @xmath44 factors then into @xmath45 where the factor @xmath46 represents the purely elastic part of the partition sum ; this factor plays a role only in deriving the rg equation for the free energy density and will be considered later on in detail . in the coulomb gas factor @xmath47 of the partition sum , it has to be summed over all spatial configurations of interacting charges , which can take on any integer value , but because the charge fugacities @xmath33 are sufficiently small , only positive and negative unit charges have to be considered , which obey in addition a neutrality condition . switching from the continuum description with a short wavelength cutoff @xmath17 to a description on a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath17 and lattice vectors @xmath48 for easier notation ,",
    "one obtains the following expression for the replicated disorder averaged partition sum : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath52 has the same block form as @xmath32 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "the block form of the matrix @xmath33 implies that two kinds of charges exist differing in their fugacities and , moreover , in their interactions with other charges due to the block form of the matrix @xmath56 .    taking this into account , a rg calculation in the style of cardy and ostlund ( co ) @xcite can be performed , which yields the following rg recursions in the limit @xmath55 upon a change of scale by a factor @xmath57 ( henceforth we always include a factor @xmath58 in @xmath59,@xmath60 and @xmath61 and a factor @xmath62 in @xmath63 , @xmath64 . ) : @xmath65 the parameter @xmath0 is a free parameter in these equations with @xmath66 in the limit @xmath55 ; possible choices for @xmath0 will be discussed later on .",
    "( [ flow1 ] ) , ( [ flow2 ] ) show that @xmath67 is not renormalized ; this result is exact to all orders in the @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) due to a statistical invariance under tilt @xcite .    in the special replica symmetric cases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we get back the flow equations of co : in the rg equations for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath64 ( @xmath63 ) plays the role of the single disorder strength parameter in @xcite , the diagonal matrix elements @xmath72 ( @xmath59 ) of @xmath73 are not renormalized , and also the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath61 ( @xmath74 ) and the fugacity @xmath64 ( @xmath63 ) renormalize as in @xcite .",
    "the system exhibits the known co fixed points @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . for @xmath70 the rg flow",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    "@xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) does not feed back into the rg flow of the other quantities and does therefore not enter physical results like correlation functions ( see below ) . for this reason the introduction of a small initial replica asymmetric",
    "perturbation @xmath79 has no effect on physical results if @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , although @xmath80 turns out to be a relevant perturbation under rg ( see below ) .",
    "starting as in ( [ 4b ] ) with replica symmetric initial conditions @xmath81 , replica symmetry is preserved throughout the rg procedure independently of @xmath0 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 are not renormalized ; therefore the co scenario with the trivial fixed point @xmath82 and the non - trivial co fixed point @xmath83 is reproduced if replica symmetry holds initially .    however , introducing a small initial replica asymmetry @xmath84 contrary to ( [ 4b ] ) , the rg flow develops for @xmath24 an instability with respect to rsb .",
    "the system flows for @xmath85 to a regime with @xmath86 and for @xmath87 to a regime @xmath88 ( entering on large length scales the unphysical regime of negative fugacities @xmath63 ) .",
    "in particular the replica symmetric co fixed point @xmath89 , @xmath90 is unstable against small replica asymmetric perturbations . a linear stability analysis of the co fixed point yields ( @xmath91 )",
    "@xmath92 these equations describe an instability with eigenvalue @xmath93 of the co fixed point with respect to perturbations @xmath94 .",
    "to avoid entering the unphysical regime of negative fugacities , we consider only perturbations @xmath85 .",
    "as it is seen from ( [ ls1 ] ) , ( [ ls2 ] ) , such a perturbation causes the charge interaction strength parameter @xmath59 to decrease and the asymmetry @xmath94 to increase ; finally , @xmath59 renormalizes to 0 following ( [ flow1 ] ) .",
    "this flow towards the fixed point @xmath95 implies that one non - interacting type of unit charge with fugacity @xmath63 appear on large length scales .",
    "furthermore , we can find from ( [ flow4 ] ) , ( [ flow5 ] ) two additional non - trivial rsb fixed points ( [ 13a ] ) and ( [ 13b ] ) with @xmath96 , @xmath97 for each of them : @xmath98 at a certain @xmath99 the fixed points ( [ 13a ] ) and ( [ 13b ] ) fall exactly together . only for @xmath100",
    "the fixed point ( [ 13a ] ) is in the physical regime @xmath101 of non - negative fugacities .",
    "moreover , the fixed point ( [ 13a ] ) is in this range of @xmath0 stable with respect to perturbations in @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( getting marginal with respect to perturbations in @xmath64 at @xmath102 where it coincides with ( [ 13b ] ) ) , whereas the fixed point ( [ 13b ] ) is unstable with respect to perturbations @xmath103 .",
    "therefore the fixed point ( [ 13a ] ) is attractive for all rg trajectories starting with @xmath104 ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b ) while the fixed point ( [ 13b ] ) is attractive only for rg trajectories with @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 ( [ 13b ] ) is the only rsb fixed point in the physical regime of non - negative fugacities @xmath107 .",
    "it is in this range of @xmath0 the attractive fixed point for all rg trajectories with @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "1c,1d ) ; furthermore , it is stable with respect to perturbations in @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    as pointed out in ( [ 4a ] ) , ( [ 4b ] ) , the proper initial values @xmath109 and @xmath110 are replica symmetric with @xmath111 .",
    "it remains unclear in this approach how the initial asymmetry @xmath112 necessary for the development of an instability with respect to rsb can be obtained from physical reasons .",
    "one hint is given in the next section where it is shown by comparison with the replica symmetric co flow for @xmath111 that contributions to the free energy from large scale fluctuations can be optimized ( which means maximized in the limit @xmath55 ) if a small perturbation @xmath112 is introduced .",
    "in the high - temperature phase for @xmath22 the system flows to the stable trivial replica symmetric fixed point @xmath82 regardless of an initial asymmetry @xmath113 . in this phase the trivial replica",
    "fixed point is stable with respect to the rsb perturbation @xmath114 so that rsb can not occur in the high - temperature phase as it is expected .",
    "for @xmath20 the trivial fixed point stays marginally stable .",
    "we want to proceed with a discussion of energetic aspects of the instability in the rg flow upon introducing a replica asymmetric perturbation @xmath85 in the low - temperature phase .",
    "this enables us to fix the so far undetermined block size parameter @xmath0 if @xmath85 and to compare the free energy in the rsb case with @xmath85 with the free energy in the replica symmetric co case @xmath115 . the standard procedure to determine @xmath0 is to maximize the free energy density per replica in the limit @xmath116 with respect to the additional free parameter @xmath0 .",
    "as a consequence of the factor @xmath126 appearing in the integrand of ( [ 19 ] ) , the main contribution to @xmath127 comes from the short scales .",
    "starting at @xmath124 , @xmath125 and evaluating ( [ 19 ] ) straightforwardly to the leading order in @xmath128 , one obtains a maximum of @xmath127 at the replica symmetric @xmath71 .",
    "this is because the main contribution to @xmath129 comes on short scales from the term @xmath130/2\\xi^2 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent part of @xmath130/2\\xi^2 $ ] can be approximated by means of a linear stability analysis of the flow equations ( [ flow1])([flow5 ] ) at the co fixed point enlarging on ( [ ls1 ] ) , ( [ ls2 ] ) as @xmath131/2\\xi^2 $ ] with a maximum at @xmath71 .",
    "on the other hand , the maximization of the asymptotic large scale contributions leads to a quite different result . examining the large scale contributions",
    ", one has to investigate the asymptotics of the integrand in ( [ 19 ] ) and to maximize @xmath129 in the limit of @xmath132 . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to derive the asymptotics of @xmath61 which is determined by the flow equation ( [ flow3 ] ) . from ( [ flow3 ] ) follows that for @xmath133 @xmath61 is asymptotically linear divergent with an asymptotics @xmath134 where @xmath135 is taken in the stable rsb fixed point ( [ 13a ] ) , which is @xmath136 to a good approximation .",
    "however , we find in the regime @xmath137 from ( [ flow3 ] ) a saturation of @xmath61 to a value @xmath138 because the stable rsb fixed point is in this regime given by ( [ 13b ] ) with @xmath75 . to obtain an estimate for @xmath138 one has to determine the characteristic scale @xmath139 on which @xmath64 renormalizes towards 0 ; a linear stability analysis of the flow equations ( [ flow1 ] ) , ( [ flow4 ] ) , ( [ flow5 ] ) at the co fixed point extending ( [ ls1 ] ) , ( [ ls2 ] ) reveals that @xmath139 can be approximated as @xmath140 . from ( [ flow3 ] ) it follows @xmath141 for the leading order contribution in @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , it is seen from the flow equation ( [ flow1 ] ) that @xmath143 on large scales . using these results for @xmath61 and @xmath59",
    ", one can verify easily from ( [ 18 ] ) that the most divergent contributions to @xmath129 come from @xmath144/2\\xi^2 $ ] for large @xmath6 .",
    "maximization of these terms yields @xmath145 because the maximization of the second term restricts @xmath0 to values @xmath137 to avoid the occurrence of the linear divergence in the regime @xmath146 and the maximization of the only logarithmically diverging first term singles out the greatest value @xmath102 of the interval @xmath137 .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is in fairly good agreement with @xcite .",
    "rsb is a large scale effect associated with the existence of diverging energy barriers generating metastable states .",
    "therefore it seems to be more reasonable to consider only the large scale contributions to the free energy in ( [ 19 ] ) although the expression ( [ 19 ] ) for @xmath127 is dominated by its short scale part .",
    "this is equivalent to considering the free energy of the renormalized but not rescaled hamiltonian on large scales but discarding a constant energy shift depending on @xmath0 which comes from short scales .",
    "this energy shift , which is essentially replica symmetric , may describe the free energy of single metastable states . in the presence of an initial asymmetric perturbation @xmath85 , maximization of the large scale contributions to the free energy yields then a maximum at @xmath102 as derivated above .",
    "comparison of these large scale contributions for the flow to the rsb fixed point when ( @xmath85 ) and for the replica symmetric flow to the co fixed point ( @xmath115 ) shows that this part of the free energy is greater in the rsb case .",
    "this is because the most divergent contribution to @xmath129 is in the replica symmetric case as in the rsb case given by @xmath130/2\\xi^2 $ ] with @xmath147 but the replica symmetric co fixed point value @xmath148 for @xmath135 is always greater than or equal to ( @xmath70 ) the rsb fixed point values given by ( [ 13a ] ) , ( [ 13b ] ) .",
    "therefore it is energetically favorable on large scales to break the replica symmetry by introducing a perturbation @xmath85 .",
    "this energy gain can occur on scales larger than @xmath149 .    in the high - temperature phase",
    "the trivial fixed point is stable with respect to the introduction of a perturbation @xmath113 .",
    "for this reason the large scale contributions to the free energy are the same as in the replica symmetric case .",
    "for the short scale contributions to the free energy the same argumentation applies as in the low - temperature phase leading to a maximum at the replica symmetric @xmath70 if @xmath113 .",
    "so rsb is energetically not favorable in the high - temperature phase as it is expected .",
    "the rg flow and fixed point structure changes significantly upon introducing an energetically favorable , replica asymmetric perturbation @xmath85 in the low - temperature phase as outlined above .",
    "as well the behaviour of the @xmath150-correlations changes drastically depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the fourier transformed correlations between replicas on large scales can be calculated by using a gaussian approximation to the renormalized but not rescaled replica hamiltonian , which yields for small @xmath151 @xcite @xmath152 so that the large scale correlations depend essentially only on the asymptotic rg flow of the matrix elements @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    from expression ( [ 15 ] )",
    "one can verify that the connected correlation function @xmath153 does not change its form at the transition , independently from the introduction of a nonzero @xmath114 due to the non - renormalization of @xmath154 , contrary to the @xmath150-correlations @xcite .    for the @xmath150-correlations ( [ 15 ] ) yields",
    "@xmath155 in the high - temperature phase no rsb takes place , even if @xmath112 , and there is essentially no renormalization of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; the connected @xmath156-correlation function and the @xmath150-correlation function coincide then and @xmath157",
    ".    in the low - temperature phase the asymptotics of @xmath61 , which is determined by the flow equation ( [ flow3 ] ) , is of special interest because in the replica symmetric case , i.e.   without a replica asymmetric perturbation ( @xmath158 ) , the asymptotics @xmath159 diverging linearly gives correlations @xmath160 diverging with @xmath2 @xcite .    in the rsb case with an initial @xmath161",
    ", @xmath61 has also a linear divergent asymptotics @xmath147 for @xmath146 ( see above ) , where @xmath136 is taken in the stable rsb fixed point ( [ 13a ] ) .",
    "this entails @xmath150-correlations diverging also with @xmath2 for this range of @xmath0 but with a prefactor reduced by a factor @xmath162 compared to the replica symmetric case ; in particular , we get back the replica symmetric co result choosing @xmath70 .",
    "the situation changes significantly in the regime @xmath137 because the stable rsb fixed point is in this regime given by ( [ 13b ] ) with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore @xmath61 saturates on large scales to a value @xmath163 for the leading order contribution in @xmath142 ( see above ) and we obtain from ( [ 16 ] ) only logarithmically divergent @xmath150-correlations with a prefactor @xmath164 which is greater than in the high - temperature phase . to the leading order in @xmath142",
    "this yields correlations @xmath165 ; with our above choice ( [ 20 ] ) of @xmath166 we get @xmath167 .",
    "this implies that the prefactor of the logarithm increases with @xmath142 in the low - temperature phase .    our results for the low - temperature phase show that within the one - step rsb rg approach with a small initial replica asymmetry @xmath161 , it is possible to obtain the known replica symmetric result for the @xmath150-correlations diverging like @xmath2 @xcite if @xmath70 as well as @xmath150-correlations diverging in the same way but with a smaller prefactor if @xmath168 and logarithmically divergent @xmath150-correlations with a prefactor increasing with decreasing temperature if @xmath169 .",
    "the latter possibilities are of interest with regard to the numerical simulations @xcite and the results of the variational approaches @xcite .",
    "to summarize we have shown an instability in the rg flow of the disordered planar flux line array , which is equivalent to the 2d xy - model with random anisotropy but without vortices , with respect to a one - step rsb .",
    "the flow approaches new rsb fixed points if an initial replica asymmetric perturbation is introduced .",
    "the system can optimize its free energy contributions from large length scale ( @xmath170 ) fluctuations by breaking the replica symmetry and approaching the rsb fixed point where the energetical optimal choice of @xmath0 is @xmath171 . introducing the initial perturbation ,",

    "<S> this transition has been examined by using a mapping onto a 2d xy - model with random anisotropy but without vortices and applying a renormalization group treatment to the replicated hamiltonian based on the mapping to a coulomb gas of vector charges . </S>",
    "<S> this renormalization group approach is extended by deriving renormalization group flow equations which take into account the possibility of a one - step replica symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the renormalization group flow is unstable with respect to replica asymmetric perturbations and new fixed points with a broken replica symmetry are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> approaching these fixed points the system can optimize its free energy contributions from fluctuations on large length scales ; an optimal block size parameter @xmath0 can be found . </S>",
    "<S> correlation functions for the case of a broken replica symmetry can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain both correlations diverging as @xmath1 and @xmath2 depending on the choice of @xmath0 .    replica symmetry breaking in renormalization : application to the randomly pinned planar flux array +   +    short title : replica symmetry breaking in renormalization + pacs : 64.60a , 75.10n , 74.60 g </S>"
