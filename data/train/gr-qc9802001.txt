    "increasing attention has recently been devoted to a possible alternative to the standard inflationary paradigm , the so - called pre - big bang ( pbb ) scenario @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "while referring the interested reader to @xcite for recent reviews of the subject , we will start by just recalling the essential points needed to put the present work in the correct perspective .",
    "the basic postulate of pbb cosmology is , at first sight , a shocking one : our universe would have originated from an  anti - big bang \" state , which was essentially empty , cold , flat , and decoupled .",
    "the claim is that , from such innocent - looking initial conditions , a rich universe can originate thanks to two distinct mechanisms :    * a _ classical _ gravitational instability amplifies tiny initial perturbations , inevitably pushing the universe towards a singularity in the future ( to be later identified with the standard big bang ) through a phase of accelerated expansion ( inflation ) and accelerated growth of the coupling .",
    "we refer to this phase as dilaton - driven inflation ( ddi ) . *",
    "_ quantum _ fluctuations are amplified during ddi according to the phenomenon by which perturbations freeze out as their wavelength is stretched beyond the hubble radius .",
    "this is how we are able to produce a _ hot _ big bang at the end of ddi .",
    "obviously , in order for the whole scenario to be viable , a mechanism has to be conceived to produce the exit from the dilaton - driven phase to the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology .",
    "this is the so - called exit problem @xcite , on which we will have nothing new to say in this paper .",
    "rather , our attention will be focused on the pre - big bang classical epoch , characterized by small couplings and small curvatures ( in string units ) .",
    "the big simplification that occurs in this epoch is that the field equations are basically known since they follow from the low - energy tree - level effective action of string theory .",
    "one would like to discuss the most general solution to the field equations and check under which conditions pbb inflation takes place and is sufficiently efficient to produce something like the patch of the universe presently observable to us .",
    "there have been claims @xcite that this calls for highly fine  tuned initial conditions . on the other hand , arguments given in @xcite , @xcite have suggested the following interesting possibility / conjecture : the generic initial universe that is able to give dilaton ",
    "driven inflation is one which , in the asymptotic past , converges to the milne metric with a constant dilaton .",
    "such an initial state does not look generic at first : it is so , however , in a technical sense , i.e. in that the general solution that develops pbb inflation is claimed to depend on as many arbitrary functions of space as the most general solution does .",
    "if confirmed , this would mean that pbb inflation covers a non - vanishing fraction of the total phase space ( the space of all classical solutions ) of string theory .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide a non  trivial check of the above conjecture .",
    "we shall not address the full inhomogeneous problem , for the moment , which would require a much stronger numerical effort ; we will limit our attention , instead , to the case of a spherically symmetric universe .",
    "we thus consider the problem of how a small spherically symmetric lump ( alternatively a shell ) of energy affects the otherwise trivial evolution of milne s metric .",
    "we mention that other interesting questions in spherically symmetric pre - big bang cosmology have been recently addressed by barrow and kunze @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we define our choice of gauge for the metric and write down the field equations . as usual",
    "these break up in two sets : constraints , containing only first time - derivatives , and ( constraint - preserving ) evolution equations .",
    "luckily , we are able to solve the constraints in closed form and to reduce the equations to four first - order partial differential equations ( pdes ) in one time and one space . in section 3",
    "we apply the general gradient expansion method @xcite to our particular case and construct analytic asymptotic solutions near the singularity . in section 4",
    "we outline our technique for numerically solving the equations and discuss some subtleties needed to avoid possible singularities at @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical results , both for a spherical lump and for a shell , are reported in section 5 , where comparison and matching with the analytic asymptotic formulae derived in section 3 are also made . finally , in section 6",
    ", we interpret our results in the string frame and discuss the relevance of our work to the fine - tuning question raised in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall limit our attention to the graviton ",
    "dilaton system in four space ",
    "time dimensions .",
    "other fields , such as the axion and various moduli , are taken to be frozen .",
    "the low - energy tree - level effective action in the physical ( string ) frame ( whose metric is denoted by @xmath2 ) reads @xcite , @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the string - length parameter , will play no role in the classical regime discussed here .",
    "we shall come back to its role in the later evolution in section 6 .",
    "the einstein frame , which turns out to be somewhat more convenient for solving the equations , is related to the string frame by @xmath5 , with @xmath6 denoting the present value of the dilaton . in that frame , defining @xmath7 , the action becomes @xcite : @xmath8 and leads to einstein s equation ( after eliminating its trace ) : @xmath9 and to the dilaton evolution equation : @xmath10 for spherically symmetric cosmological solutions , @xmath11 depends just on time @xmath12 and on a radial coordinate @xmath13 . in the synchronous gauge",
    "we can use spatial coordinates such that the metric takes the form ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "let us denote by a dot ( a prime ) differentiation with respect to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , introduce @xmath16 and recall the expression for the three - curvature @xmath17 on a constant @xmath12 hypersurface @xmath18 in terms of these , the full set of field equations consists of    _ i ) _ the hamiltonian and momentum constraints : @xmath19    _ ii ) _ the evolution equations for the metric @xmath20 and , finally ,    _ iii ) _ the equation for the dilaton @xmath21    this last equation can be shown to be a consequence of the previous ones and we shall therefore ignore it .",
    "one can also show that the constraints are conserved in time , thanks to the explicit form of the evolution equations .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint can be written in terms of the well - known @xmath22 parameter ( the fraction of critical energy density ) as : @xmath23 a nice simplification , which occurs in the spherically symmetric case , is that the constraints ( [ constr ] ) can be solved explicitly in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "given the quadratic character of the constraints , this leads to a four - fold ambiguity , reminiscent of the two - fold ambiguity of the homogeneous case , which we resolve by imposing ( in accordance with the pbb postulate ) a monotonic behaviour for @xmath11 at least from some time on .",
    "we then get : @xmath26 where the auxiliary quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath29    in conclusion , the final system of evolution equations contains only the metric and can be written in first - order form as : @xmath30 with @xmath31 given in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) . by using the above relations and the expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath33 given in eq .",
    "( [ solconstr ] ) , it is explicitly checked that the  integrability condition \" @xmath34 holds .",
    "an essentially trivial solution to all equations is given by the so - called milne metric , known in the literature @xcite because it represents the very late time behaviour ( with @xmath35 ) of all subcritical universes ( with @xmath36 ) . in our gauge ,",
    "milne s metric corresponds to : @xmath37 it is well known that milne s metric can be brought to minkowski s form through a coordinate transformation that maps the whole of milne s space - time into the ( interior of the ) forward or backward light cone ( depending on the sign of @xmath12 ) of minkowski space - time . the conjecture advanced in @xcite is that pre - big bang inflation finds its generic origin in open cosmologies that approach milne as @xmath38 .",
    "this is why we will choose initial data ( at some finite negative @xmath12 ) very close to milne s universe , by inserting some lump of energy / momentum through a non - trivial dilaton .",
    "generic initial data in the spherically symmetric case are known @xcite to depend on two arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "it is instructive to see how these two arbitrary functions appear in our initial data .",
    "apparently , in order to select a definite solution to eqs .",
    "( [ finalsystem ] ) , one has to provide four functions of @xmath13 on a cauchy hypersurface , i.e. @xmath39 , and @xmath40 at some initial time .",
    "however , two of these can be eliminated by the two residual gauge transformations @xcite that keep us inside the synchronous gauge .",
    "we may thus take physically distinct initial data to be given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) .",
    "appropriate combinations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the initial energy and pressure density of ( dilatonic ) matter .",
    "equivalently , we may observe that the general spherically symmetric solution of the dilaton evolution equation eq .",
    "( [ dilevol ] ) is given ( in the case of milne s metric ) by @xcite @xmath41 and thus depends on two real functions of @xmath42 ( since @xmath43 is complex ) .",
    "this latter observation allows us to make a more general remark : string vacua are usually identified with two - dimensional conformal field theories ( cfts ) resulting from a set of @xmath44-function equations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , within a particular cft , we can construct marginal ( i.e. @xmath45 ) vertex operators representing physical excitations ( particles ) propagating in the given background .",
    "a physical dilaton vertex operator depends upon two ( real ) functions of space , while a physical graviton vertex depends on four .",
    "it is tempting to identify these two ( resp .",
    "six ) degrees of freedom with the classical moduli of our spherically symmetric ( resp .",
    "generic ) solutions , since we can indeed expect a correspondence between marginal operators and the structure of moduli space in the neighborhood of a cft .",
    "in giving initial data , two precautions have to be taken : i ) we should verify that , at least initially , @xmath46 , so that all the square roots appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ finalsystem ] ) are real .",
    "consistency requires that this constraint be maintained through the evolution ; ii ) there is an apparent singularity at @xmath47 in @xmath48 and in its derivatives . of course the singularity",
    "is perfectly canceled for milne s metric in all equations , but one may encounter numerical problems or even genuine physical ones if one is not careful about the way to perturb milne .",
    "we believe that the correct way to avoid curvature singularities and to achieve a smooth algorithm is to insist on an ansatz of the form : @xmath49 giving @xmath50 it can be checked that , rewriting all equations in terms of @xmath51 , and their derivatives with respect to @xmath52 , all singularities at @xmath53 are automatically removed and that the structure of the ansatz is maintained during the evolution . a possible way to construct sets of `` good '' initial data along these lines is discussed in the appendix .",
    "in this section we use , as in @xcite,@xcite , the gradient expansion technique @xcite to construct analytic asymptotic solutions to our spherically symmetric field equations .",
    "this exercise is important in several respects .",
    "firstly , it illustrates the gradient expansion technique in a situation where the momentum constraints can be explicitly solved .",
    "secondly , it will allow a very non - trivial check of the numerical method .",
    "finally , it allows the numerical solutions to be continued in a region where the computation undergoes a critical slowdown because of the singularity .",
    "hence , in the problem at hand , analytic and numerical methods very nicely complement each other .    assuming that spatial gradients become subleading near the singularity",
    ", we can simplify eqs .",
    "( [ constr ] ) , ( [ evol ] ) to the following form : @xmath54 following the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite we first solve the evolution equations and obtain : @xmath55 the hamiltonian constraint can be easily solved . choosing the branch corresponding to a growing dilaton",
    "we obtain : @xmath56 we now integrate once more the evolution equations to obtain the metric : @xmath57    finally , we solve the momentum constraint .",
    "most terms automatically match and we get the single condition : @xmath58 the general solution thus appears to depend upon four functions of space , i.e. @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , giving the line - element : @xmath61   \\nonumber\\ ] ] obviously , we can reabsorb @xmath62 in a redefinition of the @xmath13 coordinate , @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , the choice of equal - time slices allows us to remove the space dependence of @xmath60 .",
    "we are thus left , as in the previous section , with just two physically meaningful functions of @xmath13 for the characterization of our dynamical system , as should be the case for the general spherically symmetric solution @xcite .",
    "actually , the situation is a bit more subtle as far as the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath60 is concerned . inserting the above asymptotic solution back into the exact equations , one finds that spatial derivatives are only subleading for sufficiently small values of @xmath64 . in other words , at least in the einstein frame , one _ has _ to choose appropriate time slices so that @xmath60 is constant and only then can one neglect spatial derivatives . constructing these privileged time slices",
    "is not a simple problem and therefore , in this paper , we will only check ( see section 5 ) the asymptotic formulae in the vicinity of the minimum of @xmath60 ( i.e. near the point where the singularity is first reached ) . in section 6 we will argue that an alternative solution to this problem consists in going over to the synchronous gauge in the string frame . in this case , spatial derivatives ( at fixed string - frame time ) turn out to be always subleading near the singularity .",
    "this suggests that it would be desirable to numerically solve the equations directly in the string frame .",
    "we shall now briefly describe the essential aspects of the numerical algorithm and its practical implementation .",
    "the system given by eqs .",
    "( [ finalsystem ] ) is similar to a hamiltonian one with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "its numerical implementation must necessarily introduce a limit on the number of degrees of freedom , which can be done in several ways .",
    "our present choice is to introduce a finite grid in the variable @xmath13 and to define the derivatives with respect to @xmath13 by a spectral method , based on the fourier transform , which allows us to reach a high precision .",
    "alternative techniques , such as using a symbolic language or applying finite elements techniques , will be considered in the near future . in our approach ,",
    "a special care must be devoted to boundary conditions , since the fourier transform preferably works in periodic boundary conditions , which are not adequate to our problem .",
    "as we explain later on , this problem is solved by letting @xmath13 extend to a symmetric interval and by continuing the fields to the negative @xmath13-axis .",
    "time evolution is generated via a standard integration routine with variable step and local error control .    to prepare the equations to be implemented in numerical terms , it is convenient to introduce new fields , which describe the metric as a perturbation from a milne background :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is defined by @xmath67 .",
    "the advantage of working in the milne background is that the shifted fields , unlike the background , vanish at @xmath68 and we can thus introduce a finite volume cutoff .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath47 are crucial ; as we have already noticed , regularity at @xmath47 is achieved if we assume eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , in the equivalent form @xmath69 with boundary conditions at @xmath47 @xmath70 in order to satisfy these boundary conditions and still apply the fourier transform to compute field derivatives , we continue the fields to a symmetric interval @xmath71 ; we enforce the correct boundary conditions by extending @xmath72 _ to symmetric functions _ and @xmath73 _ to antisymmetric ones_. in terms of the new fields , the system ( [ finalsystem ] ) becomes @xmath74 where @xmath75 and eq .",
    "( [ shifted ] ) is understood .",
    "notice that the system is identically satisfied by taking @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which represents milne s background .",
    "the initial conditions we want to examine are given by eq .",
    "( [ deformation ] ) ( with @xmath78 ) , which in terms of the shifted fields reads as follows : @xmath79}\\right)\\,+\\,(\\xi_0 \\longrightarrow -\\xi_0 ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\chi_s(\\xi,0 ) & = & -6\\,\\exp\\{-2\\alpha_s(\\xi,0)\\}\\label{ansatz}\\\\ \\eta(\\xi,0 ) & = & \\sigma(\\xi,0 ) = 0\\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a suitable constant .",
    "we have implemented this system of partial differential equations in matlab@xmath81 , which offers very efficient built - in routines for integrating ordinary differential equations , a fast fourier transform and an integrated graphic environment.onofri .",
    "] the only tricky point in the numerical treatment of these equations refers to the delicate cancelation mechanism that makes the solutions regular at @xmath47 in spite of the apparent singular nature of the terms involving @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this cancelation , which takes place in exact arithmetic , is spoiled by finite precision arithmetic and makes the solution singular after a short time evolution .",
    "the remedy that we adopt consists in enforcing regularity near the origin by a polynomial interpolation and a fourier filtering , which truncates high frequency components above a certain cutoff .",
    "a consistency check is given by solving the equations with various initial _",
    "ansatze _ corresponding to @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "the former case represents a spherically symmetric perturbation concentrated at the origin , while the latter spreads out over a spherical shell and naturally avoids the singularity .",
    "a similar behaviour is indeed observed in both cases with fields @xmath86 and @xmath87 blowing up as @xmath22 approaches 1 .",
    "we report some preliminary results obtained by running our code with the initial ansatz given by eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) and for several values of the parameters ( @xmath88 ) ; a typical run involves a grid with @xmath89 points and takes less than an hour on a modern workstation .",
    "we set a finite - size @xmath90 and an ultraviolet cutoff at half way to the size of the brillouin zone .",
    "the routine ode45 of matlab can be used with its standard setup ; a special care must be devoted to the choice of the _ absolute tolerance _",
    "parameter which should be set differently for the various fields which have very different scales .",
    "the evolution starts at negative @xmath12 from the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) ; we report both cases ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) , which indeed show a similar pattern ( see figs.([fig1],[fig1b ] ) ) . in figs.([fig2],[fig2b ] ) both @xmath22 and the dilaton are shown .",
    "we examined the numerical solution in order to check the validity of the approximation introduced in sec.[asympt ] .",
    "in particular we were able to check the asymptotic behaviour in the region where @xmath22 is very close to 1 , where eqs .",
    "( [ asy1 ] ) and ( [ asy2 ] ) predict a linear regime in time for the following expressions @xmath91 ( notice that the value of @xmath92 is negligible ) .",
    "this is clearly displayed in fig.[fig4 ] .    from a linear fit to the data , it is then possible to extract information about the unknown functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we find that , as expected , @xmath93 has an extremum near the @xmath22 peak with a small curvature @xmath95 , which is responsible for the small deviations from the asymptotic estimates of eq .",
    "( [ asy1 ] ) ( see fig.[t00 ] ) .    in all the cases we have examined so far",
    ", the function @xmath94 turns out to be very small ( see fig.[l00 ] ) .",
    "but this is probably due to our initial starting point with @xmath96 .",
    "we are currently exploring a wider class of initial data , in order to find the generic properties of the solutions .    .",
    "[ t00 ]    finally , our code can also be run backwards i.e. towards @xmath97 . in this case , however , we encounter a problem : although @xmath11 keeps decreasing in magnitude as @xmath12 becomes more and more negative , it also starts to oscillate , as expected @xcite . as a result",
    ", the constraints can not be always solved with the sign determination given in ( [ solconstr ] ) .",
    "we have been able to solve this problem by imposing the constraints only on the initial data and by otherwise working in an enlarged phase space containing also @xmath11 and @xmath24 .",
    "this procedure has the further advantage of allowing a non - trivial check of the numerical precision by verifying that the constraints are conserved .",
    "we expect to present results obtained by following this better procedure in the near future .",
    "in order to discuss better the physical meaning of our result it would be convenient to transform them back to the original string frame . it is difficult to make the change of frame numerically and , indeed , we think it would be easier to start directly the whole exercise in the new frame . fortunately , we can achieve a semi - quantitative understanding of the string frame solutions by noticing that :    * initially the two frames coincide , since the dilaton is constant ; * our numerical results , as the singularity is approached , fit very well with the analytic asymptotic formulae given in section 3 .",
    "the latter observation allows us to perform the passage to the string frame analytically ( and of course approximately ) near the singularity .",
    "following ref .",

    "the important exponents @xmath99 and @xmath100 are completely determined by the function @xmath94 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ asy1 ] ) .",
    "we find : @xmath101 it is reassuring to check that the @xmath99 satisfy kasner s condition : @xmath102 and that , furthermore , @xmath103 as in the homogeneous case . also note that , in the limit @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "this corresponds to the isotropic limit . from the above formulae",
    "we see that , in the string frame , the metric is typically ( super)inflationary since the inequalities @xmath106 are almost always fulfilled .",
    "it is easy to check that , as a consequence , the string frame asymptotic solution is reliable even if one does not choose time slices corresponding to @xmath107 .",
    "the expansion rate is maximal for the regions where @xmath92 is very close to zero , i.e. for very isotropic regions .",
    "we conclude that , as anticipated in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , regions with the correct dilaton perturbation do undergo a superinflationary expansion , become asymptotically flat and , most likely , isotropic .",
    "it would of course be most interesting to attempt to generalize our computations to the case of several lumps and/or shells located randomly in space and with random initial parameters and see what kind of chaotic inflationary universe will result .",
    "this , unfortunately , appears to demand going beyond the spherically symmetric situation we have considered in this paper .    in conclusion",
    ", our numerical approach appears to confirm that , at least in the case of spherical symmetry , dilaton - driven inflation naturally emerges as a classical gravitational instability of small perturbations around the trivial ( milne ) vacuum .",
    "nonetheless , before being able to address / answer completely the criticism expressed in @xcite , the present work needs to be expanded in at least two directions : i ) classical phase space has to be swept more systematically , in particular away from the case of spherical symmetry ; ii ) the behaviour at very early times has to be thoroughly investigated so that the possibility ( see n. kaloper et al .",
    "@xcite ) that quantum fluctuations at very early times may destroy the homogeneity needed for turning on dilaton - driven inflation is properly assessed .",
    "as discussed at the end of section v , this latter problem requires a new way of enforcing the constraints on which we are presently working and hope to report soon .",

    "f.  piazza for useful collaboration in developing part of the numerical code .",
    "one of us ( gv ) is grateful to e. rabinovici for useful discussions concerning marginal operators and moduli space in cfts .",
    "in this appendix we illustrate our procedure for choosing the small initial perturbation of milne s metric in such a way as to fulfill the necessary positivity constraints as well as regularity at @xmath47 .",
    "the physical idea is quite simple : since we know that milne s solution is regular and satisfies all the constraints , we construct initial data from a small deformation of milne .",
    "notice that there is no need that the deformation satisfies the evolution equations .",
    "such a deformation is localized at @xmath109 , with some anisotropy concentrated at @xmath110 .",
    "the deformation rapidly drops to zero far from these two values of @xmath13 .",

    "the formulae for the initial data simplify considerably and positivity constraints can be solved in many cases analytically .",
