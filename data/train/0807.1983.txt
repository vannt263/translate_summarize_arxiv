    "accretion is the main source of energy in many astrophysical objects including different types of binary stars , binary x - ray sources , quasars , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "though the first development of accretion theory started a long time ago ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ; bondi 1952 ) , intensive development of the theory began after the discovery of the first x - ray sources ( giacconi et al .",
    "1962 ) and quasars ( schmidt 1963 ) . since the removal of the angular momentum process operates on slower timescales as compared to free - fall time , the infalling gas with sufficiently high angular momentum can form a disklike structure around a central gravitating body that can be thin or thick depending upon their geometrical shapes .",
    "the models of thin accretion disks are perhaps better developed and seem to have good observational basis ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , for the thick accretion disks , no fully developed model exists , and there remain many theoretical uncertainties about their structure and stability ( banerjee et al .",
    "1995 ; ghanbari & abbassi 2004 ; ghanbari et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "it is thought that accretion disks , whether in star - forming regions , in x - ray binaries , in cataclysmic variables , or in the centers of active galactic nuclei , are likely to be threaded by magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , the role of magnetic fields has been analyzed in detail by a number of investigators ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; lubow et al .",
    "1994 ; banerjee et al . 1995 ; shadmehri 2004).a mechanism for angular momentum transport is another key ingredient in theory of accretion processes and still many theoretical uncertainties remain about its nature .",
    "as originally pointed out in lynden - bell ( 1969 ) and shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , a magnetic field can also contribute to the angular momentum transport .",
    "a robust mechanism of the excitation of magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence was shown to operate in accretion disks due to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ( balbus & hawley 1998 ; machida et al .",
    "1999 ; begelman & pringle 2007 ) .",
    "the toroidal magnetic fields have been observed in the outer regions of yso discs ( ( aitken et al .",
    "1993 ; wright et al . 1993 ; greaves et al .",
    "1997 ) and in the galactic center ( novak et al . 2003 ; chuss et al . 2003 ) .",
    "accretion disks containing toroidal magnetic field have been studied by several authors ( fukue & okada 1990 ; geroyannis & sidiras 1992,1993,1995 ; banerjee et al .",
    "1995 ; terquem & papaloizou 1996 ; machida et al .",
    "1999 ; liffman & bardou 1999 ; rempel 2006 ; begelman & pringle 2007 ; akizuki and fukue 2006 ) .",
    "fukue and okada ( 1990 ) examined the oscillations of a gaseous disk which were penetrated by toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "geroyannis and sidiras ( 1992,1993 ) described differentially rotating polytropic models distorted by toroidal magnetic fields . also , geroyannis and sidiras ( 1995 ) considered dissipative effects by viscous friction of differentially rotating visco - polytropic models that were further distorted by a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "banerjee et al . (",
    "1995 ) presented a toroidal magnetic field that was generated by interaction rotating plasma and dipolar magnetic field of central object ; they showed that toroidal magnetic field has an important effect in structure of the disk .",
    "terquem and papaloizou ( 1996 ) studied the a linear stability of a differentially rotating disk containing a purely toroidal magnetic field .",
    "they presented disks containing a purely toroidal magnetic field are always found to be unstable .",
    "machida et al . ( 1999 ) considered three - dimensional global magnetohydrodynamical simulation of a torus treated by toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "akizuki and fukue ( 2006 , hereafter af ) examined the effect of toroidal magnetic field on a viscous gaseous disk around a central object under an advection dominated stage . assuming steady and axisymmetric flow and using steady self - similar method",
    ", they presented the nature of the disk was significantly different from that of the weakly magnetized case .",
    "+ in this study , we want to explore how the dynamic of a rotating and accreting viscous gas depends on its toroidal magnetic field . by solving mhd equations for accreting gases that are self - similar in time , we will answer this question .",
    "we assume that turbulent viscosity is due to angular momentum transport of the fluid and there is efficient radiation cooling in the flow .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the general problem of constructing a model for quasi - spherical magnetized polytropic accretion flow is defined . in section 3 ,",
    "self - similar method for solving the integrated equations which govern the dynamical behavior of the accreting gas is utilized .",
    "the summary of the model is presented in section 4 .",
    "we use spherical coordinate @xmath5 centered on the accreting object and make the following standard assumptions :    * the accreting gas is a highly ionized gas with infinitive conductivity ; * the magnetic field has only an azimuthal component ; * the gravitational force on a fluid element is characterized by the newtonian potential of a point mass,@xmath6 , with @xmath7 representing the gravitational constant and @xmath8 standing for the mass of the central star ; * the equations written in spherical coordinates are considered in the equatorial plane @xmath9 and terms with any @xmath10 and @xmath11 dependence are neglected , hence all quantities will be expressed in terms of spherical radius @xmath12 and time @xmath13 ; * for the sake of simplicity , the self - gravity and general relativistic effects have been neglected ; * the equation of state for the accreting gas is @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being constant .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of such system can be analyzed by perfect magnetohydrodynamics approximation . as stated in the introduction , the study focused on analyzing the role of toroidal magnetic field and viscosity in an accreting gas .",
    "thus , the basic equations are the continuity equation , @xmath17 the equations of motion , @xmath18 @xmath19=    \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left[\\nu\\rho r^{4}\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial r}\\right],\\ ] ] the polytropic equation , @xmath20 and the field freezing equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angular speed and @xmath23 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient . as was mentioned above",
    ", our understanding of turbulent viscosity is incomplete , and for this reason we adopt an empirical prescription ,  so we employ the usual @xmath1-prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) for the viscosity which we write in the following form for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity , @xmath24 ( narayan & yi 1994 ) where @xmath1 is constant ( tout 2000 ; king et .",
    "al . 2007 ) and @xmath25 is the keplerian angular velocity , keplerian angular velocity is defined by @xmath26 note that @xmath23 is a function of position and time , since @xmath25 depends on @xmath12 , and @xmath27 varying by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to study the effect of viscosity ,",
    "@xmath1 is used as a free parameter .    before initiating to solve the equations ( 1)-(5 ) ,",
    "it is convenient to non - dimensionalize the equations .",
    "so , the dimensionless variables are introduced according to @xmath28 where @xmath29    under these transformations and with the use of equations ( 4),(6 ) , and ( 7 ) , equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) do not change , but equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) become @xmath30 @xmath31=    \\frac{\\alpha}{r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left [   r^{11/2}\\rho^{\\gamma-1}\\frac{\\partial\\omega}{\\partial r}\\right],\\ ] ]",
    "to grasp the physics of the accreting viscous gas in a toroidal magnetic field , the technique of self - similar analysis proves to be useful . of course , this method is familiar from its wide range of applications in the full set of equations of mhd in many research fields of astrophysics . in self - similar formulation ,",
    "the various physical quantities are expressed as dimensionless functions of a similarity variable , so it lends itself to a set of partial differential equations , such as those mentioned above , to be transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations . a similarity solution ,",
    "although constituting only a limited part of problem , is often useful in understanding the basic behavior of the system .",
    "so , in order to seek similarity solutions for the above equations , a similarity variable @xmath32 is introduced as @xmath33 and it is assumed that each physical quantity is given by the following form : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    the exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constant which must be determined . by substituting the equations ( 12)-(16 ) into equations ( 1 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , the following general results are obtained : @xmath40 and @xmath41 the above results imply each physical quantity retain a similar spacial shape as the flow evolves , but the radius of the flow increases proportionally to @xmath42 .",
    "also time - dependent density , the pressure and the toroidal magnetic field are varying by @xmath15 , on the other hand , they are decreasing by time for @xmath43 .    here",
    ", let us seek time - dependent self - similar of the mass accretion rate @xmath44 we can non - dimensionalize the equation ( 19 ) under transformation ( 8) and    @xmath45    where @xmath46 under transformations ( 8) and ( 20 ) , equation ( 19 ) does not change and its behavior under similarity quantities that are implied in equations ( 12)-(16 ) can be considered .",
    "the similarity solution shows that the mass accretion rate @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 . when @xmath49 , the mass accretion rate is independent of time and decreases in @xmath50 , time - dependent behavior of this quantity will be applied in next section",
    ".    solving equations ( 1 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) , and ( 19 ) under transformations ( 12)-(15 ) in nonmagnetically state , makes it clear that behavior of physical quantities in the nonmagnetically and the magnetically disk are the same .",
    "the result is one of the strictures of time - dependent self - similar solution .        when @xmath0 , an appropriate asymptotic solution as @xmath60 is of the form @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 in which @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    in order to derive the above relations , the mass accretion rate and @xmath69 parameter were used , that is ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure .",
    "when @xmath60 and @xmath0 the mass accretion rate becomes @xmath70 , and the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure becomes @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "these relations were applied to derive equations ( 32)-(35 ) . in order to present of importance of magnetic field in the disk ,",
    "@xmath73 parameter will be used .",
    "asymptotic solution shows that @xmath1 parameter is effective in inner edge of the disk and physical quantities are sensitive to it , i.e. , the radial infall velocity increases by adding @xmath1 , the angular velocity is sub - keplerian for all values of @xmath1 , and the density and the toroidal magnetic field in the inner edge of the disk decrease with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "these results that are achieved for inner edge of the disk are qualitatively consistent with the results of af .",
    "now , it is possible to derive approximate constant of integration @xmath56 in equation ( 26 ) , by using equations ( 28)-(35 ) @xmath74    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm      if the value of @xmath75 is guessed , that is a point very near of the center , the equations can be integrated from this point to outward through the use of the above expansions",
    ". examples of such solutions are presented in figs 1 and 2 .",
    "the profiles in fig 1 and 2 are plotted for different @xmath76 that is amount of @xmath69 in @xmath75 . from guessed @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and equations ( 28 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 35 ) , we can achieve @xmath77 .",
    "the delineated quantities ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , ... ) in figs 1 and 2 are constant at steady self - similar solutions ( narayan & yi 1994 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; shadmehri 2004 ; akizuki & fukue 2006 ; ghanbari et .",
    "al . 2007 ) .    by increasing the @xmath69 parameter , which indicates the role of magnetic field in the dynamics of accretion disks , the radial - thickness of the disk decreases ; the equations ( 13 ) and ( 17 )",
    "imply that compression increases by time .",
    "liffman & bardou ( 1999 ) and campbell & heptinstall ( 1998 ) showed compression of disk in height direction by effect of toroidal magnetic field , but they did not consider the effect of toroidal magnetic field in the radial - thickness of the disk .",
    "also , by adding the @xmath69 parameter , the radial infall velocity increases ; such property is qualitatively consistent with af .",
    "this is due to the magnetic tension terms , which dominate the magnetic pressure term in the radial momentum equation that assist the radial infall motion .",
    "the flow is differentially rotating , although it is highly sub - keplerian at large radii .",
    "for investigating of existence of transonic point , the square of the sound velocity is introduced that subsequently can be expressed as @xmath80 here , @xmath81 the _ adiabatic sound velocity _ in self - similar flow , which is rescaled in the course of time .",
    "the _ mach number _ referred to the reference frame is defined as ( fukue 1984 ; gaffet & fukue 1983 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the velocity of the reference frame which is moving outward here as time goes by .",
    "the mach number introduced so far , represents the _ instantaneous _ and _ local _ mach number of the unsteady self - similar flow . as we see in fig 2",
    ", there is a transonic point , that denotes the square of mach number is equal to unit ( @xmath84 ) . by adding strength of the magnetic field , transonic point approaches to central object .",
    "the solution shows that @xmath69 parameter varies by radii and is important at larger radii , while in steady self similar solution this parameter is constant .",
    "the @xmath69 parameter shows that the dominate pressure in the outer region of disk is magnetic pressure , that this result is consistent with observed yso disks ( aitken et al .",
    "1993 ; wright et al . 1993",
    "; greaves , holland & ward - thompson 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper , the equations of time - dependent quasi - spherical accretion flow with toroidal magnetic field have been solved by semi - analytical similarity methods .",
    "the flow is able to radiate efficiency , so we substituted the polytropic equation instead energy equation .",
    "a solution was found for the important case @xmath0 that has differential rotation and viscous dissipation .",
    "the flow avoids many of the strictures of steady self - similar solutions ( narayan & yi 1994 ; akizuki & fukue 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the radial - dependence of calculated physical quantities in this sense are different from steady self - similar solution .",
    "the flow has differential rotation in small radii and has keplerian behavior at large radii , that at large radii is similar to steady self - similar solutions , also , the flow is sub - keplerian at all radii that is consistent with af when they considered disk in moderate strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the solution shows that in time - dependent of quasi - spherical accretion flow , there is a transonic point , where the point approaches to central object by increasing strength of the toroidal magnetic field . by increasing strength of the toroidal magnetic field ,",
    "the radial thickness of the disk decreases and disk becomes compress .    here",
    ", latitudinal dependence of physical quantities is ignored , although some authors showed that latitudinal dependence is important in structure of a disk ( narayan & yi 1995 ; ghanbari et .",
    "al . 2007 ) .",
    "one can investigate latitudinal behavior of such disks .",
    "also , it is assumed that there is efficient radiation cooling in the flow and used polytropic equation for energy equation . during recent years",
    "one type of accretion disks has been studied , in which the energy released through viscous processes in the disk may be trapped within the accreting gas .",
    "this kind of flow is known as advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "solution of af shows that physical quantities of the disk vary by advection parameter . in future studies",
    ", we are going to improve our model with a realistic energy equation .",
    "we wish to thank the anonymous referee for his / her very constructive comments which helped us to improve the initial version of paper ; we would also like to thank m. nejad - asghar , f. sohbat zadeh , and o. naser ghodsi for their helpful discussion ."
