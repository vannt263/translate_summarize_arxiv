    "brown dwarfs , gravitationally condensed objects whose masses are too low for equilibrium hydrogen burning , occupy the mass range between the lowest mass stars ( @xmath3 ; burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) and the giant extrasolar planets ( @xmath4 ; marcy & butler 1998 ) .",
    "the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs only slightly cooler than m dwarfs are classified as spectral type `` l '' ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 , martn et al . 1997 ) and have t@xmath5 in the range @xmath615002000  k. determining if l  type objects are brown dwarfs is difficult , because the luminosities and effective temperatures of brown dwarfs are a function of both age and mass ( e.g. burrows et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the first unambiguous brown dwarf , gl  229b , was discovered as a companion to a nearby m dwarf by nakajima et al .",
    "this object is cooler than any l dwarf and has ch@xmath1 in its atmosphere implying @xmath71300 k ( e.g. fegley & lodders 1996 ) and a sub  stellar nature .",

    "( 1999 , 2000 ) , cuby et al . ( 1999 ) and tsvetanov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) demonstrate that objects like gl  229b can form singly .",
    "a striking characteristic of known t dwarfs is the similarity of their spectra , which resemble those of the gaseous solar system planets and are very different from even the coolest l dwarfs .",
    "the l dwarf spectra are characterized by the disappearance of the tio and vo bands ( which are strong in m dwarf spectra ) , the presence of atomic alkali lines and co bands , and increasing depth of the @xmath8 bands as t@xmath5 decreases .",
    "the t dwarfs are characterized by very deep @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands in the 13 @xmath10 region .",
    "alkali metal features are present between the bands , but the 2.3@xmath10 co bands are absent , due to reduced co abundance and the overwhelming strength of the ch@xmath1 absorption .    a large remaining gap in the stellar to gas giant planet spectral sequence lies between the previously observed types l and t. in this paper , we report photometry and 0.82.5 @xmath10 spectroscopy of three very red , faint objects identified in the imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and observed at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) and the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "these objects have spectra intermediate between those of the previously known l and t dwarfs , showing the onset of ch@xmath1 absorption at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath10 , while still retaining observable co absorption at 2.3 @xmath10 .",
    "we propose that they represent the warm end of the `` t '' spectral sequence , yet to be defined in detail .",

    "we prepared a candidate l and t dwarf list for follow  up observations by searching the sdss data for point sources with @xmath20 1.6 .",
    "because of their extremely red colors , some very red , faint objects are detected only in the @xmath17 band and a search for them can be contaminated by defects .",
    "therefore , additional constraints were imposed : ( 1 ) all objects blended with neighbors , or affected by data defects , were removed ; ( 2 ) an object was required to be detected at @xmath213@xmath22 twice : in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in two observations of that region of sky , or detected in the 2mass database ; ( 3 ) a @xmath17band  only single detection was required to have @xmath2319.0 .",
    "the three objects discussed in this paper were selected from a total sky area of 225  deg@xmath24 , giving an approximate and very preliminary surface density similar to the 1 per 75  deg@xmath24 for sdss t dwarfs found by tsvetanov et al .",

    "the late m and l dwarfs show a steady progression towards redder j@xmath11k and @xmath30 colors with later spectral type , however the t dwarfs have redder @xmath30 colors and _ bluer _ j@xmath11k colors due to the strong absorption by ch@xmath1 in the h and k bands .",

    "2000 ) and the t dwarf sdss 1624 ( strauss et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the spectra show : increasingly red colors at @xmath33 m , probably due to pressure broadened na i and k i absorption ( burrows et al . 2000 ) combined with decreasing t@xmath5 ; increasing absorption in the h@xmath2o bands at 1.15  @xmath0 m , 1.4  @xmath0 m and 1.9  @xmath0 m ; increasing absorption at 1.61.7  @xmath0 m and longward of 2.2  @xmath0 m by ch@xmath1 combination and overtone bands ; decreasing absorption in the co 2.3@xmath34 band . in particular",
    ", the absorption maxima of the ch@xmath1 2@xmath35@xmath2+@xmath35@xmath36 , 2@xmath35@xmath2 , and @xmath35@xmath2+@xmath35@xmath36 bands at 1.63 , 1.67 , and 2.20  @xmath0 m become progressively deeper .",
    "the co 20 bandhead at 2.294  @xmath0 m is seen in the new objects , but the 31 bandhead at 2.323  @xmath0 m is absent ; it is considerably weaker at these temperatures and also is overwhelmed by the strong ch@xmath37 absorption at 2.315  @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectra in figure 4 reveal a clear spectral sequence . thus sdss 0837 ,",
    "sdss 1254 and sdss 1021 are examples of the sought after `` l / t transition '' objects . however , as suggested by figure 4 , they might more properly be regarded as examples of early t dwarfs , where the `` t '' spectral type is defined by the presence of ch@xmath1 absorption in the h and k bands .",
    "the strongest short wavelength infrared band of ch@xmath1 is the @xmath35@xmath2 band , centered at 3.3  @xmath0 m , and objects in which this band is present but the shorter wavelength bands reported here are absent must exist over a narrow temperature range .",
    "however , measurements at 3.3  @xmath0 m are considerably more difficult from the ground than are h and k band measurements , and objects which show only the 3.3  @xmath0 m ch@xmath1 band perhaps should be classified as l rather than t ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that the t class be defined by the presence of ch@xmath1 absorption in the k band ) . as the three objects presented here are at the co / ch@xmath1 transition temperature they are likely to have t@xmath38  k ( fegley & lodders 1996 ) and therefore masses of 2070  m@xmath39 for ages in the range 0.35  gyr ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that sdss easily identifies t dwarfs by their extremely red @xmath30 color , including the early t dwarfs identified in the present paper . on the other hand ,",
    "the j@xmath11k colors are similar to those of the common m dwarfs and these early t objects are thus very difficult to select on the basis of the near  infrared colors alone ( although the later t dwarfs are blue and _ can _ be selected this way ) .",
    "many more l and t dwarfs will be found in the sdss imaging data .",
