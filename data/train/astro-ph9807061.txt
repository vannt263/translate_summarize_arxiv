    "since their discovery about thirty years ago ( klebesadel et al . 1973 ) , @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) have made one of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "the italian - dutch bepposax satellite opened up a new era in the field in early 1997 . by the end of may 1998",
    ", afterglows have been observed in x - rays from about a dozen events , in optical wavelengths in several cases ( grb 970228 , 970508 , 971214 , 980326 , 980329 , 980519 , and possibly grb 980425 ) , and even in radio from grb 970508 , 980329 , and grb 980519 .",
    "very recently , grb 971214 was reported to have released an enormous energy of @xmath4 erg in @xmath0-rays alone ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ; wijers 1998 ) ; and grb 980425 seems to be associated with a supernova ( galama et al .",
    "1998b ) , these facts have aroused researcher s more fever and may provide crucial clues to our understanding of grbs .",
    "the fireball model has become the most popular and successful model of grbs ( mszros et al . 1994 ; fenimore et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) . after producing the main grb",
    ", the fireball will continue to expand as a thin shell into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , generating an ultra - relativistic shock .",
    "afterglows at longer wavelengths are produced by the shocked ism ( mszros & rees 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ; tavani 1997 ; sari 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1997 ; huang et al . 1998",
    "; dai & lu 1998a , b ) .",
    "it has been derived that for adiabatic expansion , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the shock radius measured in the burster s static frame , @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the shocked ism measured by the observer and @xmath8 is the observed time .",
    "these scaling laws are valid only at the ultra - relativistic stage .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to study numerically the full evolution of adiabatic fireballs from the ultra - relativistic phase to the non - relativistic phase .",
    "it is found that radiation during the mildly relativistic phase ( @xmath9 ) and the non - relativistic phase ( @xmath10 ) , which was obviously neglected in previous studies , is of great importance .",
    "in case of adiabatic expansion , the shocked ism s lorentz factor evolves based on ( sari 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ; tavani 1997 ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 erg is the original fireball energy , of which about a half is believed to have been released as @xmath0-rays during the grb phase , @xmath13 1 @xmath14 is the number density of the unshocked ism , and @xmath15 is @xmath8 in units of second .",
    "@xmath16 can be derived from @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the proton mass and @xmath19 the velocity of light .",
    "flux density at observing    ( 100,160 ) ( 0,0 )    frequency @xmath20 then declines as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the index characterizing the power - law distribution of the shocked ism electrons , @xmath23 .",
    "these expressions are valid only when @xmath24 . in general ,",
    "x - ray and optical afterglows were observed to follow power - law decays , and such a fireball / blastwave model agrees with observations quite well",
    ".    however , we notice that afterglows from grb 970228 and grb 970508 have followed simple power - law decays for as long as 190 days and 80 days respectively , while in eq.(1 ) , even @xmath25 d will lead to @xmath26 .",
    "we stress that the overall evolution of the postburst fireball can not be regarded as a simple one - phase process .",
    "one should be careful in applying those scaling laws at later times .",
    "in fact , it is clear from eq.(1 ) that the expansion will become mildly relativistic ( @xmath9 ) when @xmath27 d , and will cease to be relativistic about 30 days later at the latest .",
    "we now propose a refined model to describe the full evolution of the postburst fireballs . as usual , we suppose that the main grb occurs at , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the mass of the contaminating baryons . in the subsequent expansion , jump conditions for the shock can be described as ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 ^ 2 }      { \\hat{\\gamma } ( 2 - \\hat{\\gamma } ) ( \\gamma - 1 ) + 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electron number density and energy density    ( 100,160 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 100,160 ) ( 0,0 )    of the shocked ism respectively in the frame co - moving with the shell , @xmath36 is the lorentz factor of the shock , and @xmath37 is the adiabatic index of the ism , for which we have derived an approximation , @xmath38 , consistent with the requirement that @xmath39 for an extremely relativistic blastwave and @xmath40 for the non - relativistic sedov shock . for @xmath24 ,",
    "eqs.@xmath41 reduce to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are just the starting point of previous studies . here",
    "we expect that our equations are valid for describing relativistic shocks as well as non - relativistic blastwaves .",
    "the kinetic energy of the shocked ism in the fireball is @xmath45 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is a coefficient : @xmath48 when @xmath49 and @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "we will use an approximate equation for @xmath47 : @xmath52 . as usual , the expansion    ( 100,320 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    is assumed to be adiabatic , during which energy is conserved , so we have , @xmath53 in order to study the evolution of @xmath0 , we should add the following differential equation ( huang et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath54    eqs.(2 ) @xmath55 ( 7 ) present a perfect description of the shock .",
    "given initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath30 , @xmath16 and @xmath56 can be evaluated numerically .",
    "but under the assumption that @xmath24 , we can derive a simple analytic solution , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "additionally if @xmath60 , that is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 refers to the duration of the main grb , then @xmath63 cm , @xmath64 .",
    "these expressions are consistent with previous studies .",
    "we have evaluated the propagation of the blastwave    ( 100,160 ) ( 0,0 )    numerically , taking @xmath65 erg , @xmath66 @xmath14 , and @xmath67 m@xmath68 .",
    "1 is the evolution of @xmath0 , which follows the power - law expression of eq.(1 ) quite well when @xmath69 .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath0 ceases to be much larger than 1 when @xmath70 s , so that eq.(1 ) is no longer applicable .",
    "at least , it is problematic to assume that the shock wave was still ultra - relativistic , therefore one should be cautious in applying those scaling laws such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath21 . this fact has been completely ignored in previous studies .",
    "2 illustrates the evolution of the shock wave s velocity ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "@xmath71 differs markedly from @xmath19 after @xmath72 s , and the evolution enters the non - relativistic phase , for which a simple analytic solution is available ( lang 1980 ) : @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 . the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "2 is plotted according to eq.(9 ) .",
    "our result is in good agreement with it .",
    "3 shows our evolution of radius , also plotted are results from eq.(8 ) .",
    "we see from figs . 3 and 4 that our refined model is applicable for both relativistic and non - relativistic expansion .    to compare with observations , we need to calculate synchrotron radiation from the shocked ism",
    "as usual , electrons in the shocked ism are assumed to follow a power - law distribution , with an index of @xmath22 ; the magnetic field energy density in the co - moving frame is supposed to be a fraction @xmath76 of the energy density , @xmath77 ; and the electrons are supposed to carry a fraction @xmath78 of the energy , @xmath79 .",
    "the luminosity distance to the grb source is designated as @xmath80 .",
    "we have plotted in figs . 4 and 5 the calculated r band flux densities ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 kev fluxes ( @xmath83 ) respectively , and compared them with observed afterglows .    in fig .",
    "4a , we take @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 gpc .",
    "other parameters such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath30 are the same as in fig .",
    "generally the theoretical light curve fits grb 970228 well .",
    "however , a problem appears at later times ( @xmath88 s ) when the blastwave becomes non - relativistic .",
    "our model predicts a sharper decline , consistent with the conclusion that has been drawn by wijers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but the observed flux decays obviously slower .",
    "an overall power - law decline lasting for more than @xmath89 s would require a much larger @xmath2 or a much smaller @xmath3 to ensure that the blastwave is uniformly ultra - relativistic .",
    "however , due to the limited observational data points , it is arbitrary to make any further conclusions .",
    "for the optical afterglow from grb 970508 , a set of physical parameters have recently been carefully derived as : @xmath90 erg , @xmath91 @xmath14 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 gpc ( wijers & galama 1998 ; galama et al .",
    "1998c , d ) . in fig .",
    "4b , we have taken these values , with @xmath96 m@xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath2 is large and @xmath3 is small , the period during which the ultra - relativistic approximation is valid is substantially extended .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 keeps to be larger than 1.5 even when @xmath97 s , and the theoretical light curve are well presented by a single straight line , which fits observations satisfactorily .",
    "we note that if @xmath98 were assumed , the observational data could be reproduced even better .",
    "the afterglow from grb 970508 seemed to decay more slowly after about 80 days , implying the presence of a constant component ( pedersen et al .",
    "1998 ; galama et al .",
    "1998a ; garcia et al .",
    "1998 ) , maybe its host galaxy .",
    "the observed optical flux peaked about two days later , possibly associated with an x - ray outburst ( piro et al .",
    "this feature could not be explained by a simple blastwave model .",
    "our theoretical light curve peaks several hours later at optical wavelengths and several tens of seconds later in x - rays .",
    "the theoretical x - ray light curve is plotted and compared with observations in fig . 5 , where parameters are evaluated the same as in fig .",
    "x - ray counterparts usually fade away in less than two weeks when the expansion is still relativistic , so observed light curves are well represented by power - law relations .",
    "the simple fireball model predicts a power - law decay for grb afterglows , in rough agreement with observations .",
    "however , the fact that the blastwave might enter the non - relativistic phase when the afterglows are still detectable has been widely ignored . here",
    "we stress that the blastwave generated by a typical fireball will cease to be ultra - relativistic in @xmath72 s. one should be cautious in applying those simple scaling laws such as @xmath99 , @xmath5 , and @xmath21 ( for adiabatic expansion ) at such late times as @xmath70 s.    we have derived refined equations to describe the full evolution of postburst fireballs .",
    "our model is consistent with previous studies in both the ultra - relativistic phase and the non - relativistic phase .",
    "the predicted afterglows decay slightly sharper at the non - relativistic stage .",
    "the observed overall power - law decay lasting for several months is usually considered as a strong proof to the popular fireball model . here",
    "we point out that it has in fact raised a problem , since it requires a large @xmath2 and/or a low @xmath3 . for example",
    ", recent detection of an enormous burst grb 971214 with @xmath100 erg might ameliorate the ultra - relativistic assumption to some extent ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ; wijers 1998 ) .",
    "the solution could also be that there is a persistent energy source at the center of the grb source ( dai & lu 1998b ) ."
