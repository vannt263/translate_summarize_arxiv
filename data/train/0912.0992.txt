    "investigation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) strongly correlated electronic systems attracts substantial interest , which has been stimulated by the discovery of high - temperature superconducting cuprates@xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that superconducting and magnetic properties of cuprates are closely related .",
    "while at half - filling cuprates are antiferromagnetically ordered , evolution of their magnetic properties with doping is an interesting challenge @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 reveals the coexistence of both commensurate and incommensurate magnetic structures in the vicinity of half - filling ( hole doping @xmath3 ) @xcite . at @xmath4",
    "the system goes to an incommensurate ( spin glass ) state with the magnetic structure wave vector @xmath5 ( the corresponding long - range order is denoted in the following as diagonal ) ; the incommensurability parameter @xmath6 increases with increasing hole doping @xmath7 . for @xmath8 a magnetic structure with wave vector @xmath9",
    "( the corresponding magnetic phase is referred as parallel below ) replaces the diagonal incommensurate structure ( ref . ) , @xmath6 being approximately proportional to the hole doping up to @xmath10@xcite . at the same time , for the compound yba@xmath11cu@xmath12o@xmath13 there exists a rather wide doping window in the vicinity of half - filling , where commensurate antiferromagnetism ( or low - energy commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations ) is observed at low temperatures , probably related to the double - layer structure of this compound@xcite .",
    "cuprates are not the unique example of quasi 2d ( layered ) systems changing their magnetic properties with varying physical parameters .",
    "the layered ruthenate @xmath14 has two sheets of fermi surface @xmath15 formed by pairs of perpendicular planes and a cylindrical sheet @xmath16 ( ref . ) .",
    "the nesting provided by the @xmath15 sheets causes low - energy magnetic fluctuations with wave vector @xmath17 carrying the dominant contribution to the magnetic spectral weight , but the @xmath16 sheet also invokes low - energy fluctuations of moderate intensity with diagonal wave vector @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the compound @xmath14 , when doped by la , acquires a strong tendency to ferromagnetic ordering ( ref . ) , which is manifested itself by an enhancement of uniform susceptibility .",
    "however , no long - range ferromagnetic order is observed even for the fermi level lying in the vicinity of the van hove singularity . at the same time , the isostructural compound @xmath19 exhibits ferromagnetism under pressure @xcite .",
    "thus the magnetic phase structure of the ruthenates is very sensitive to experimental conditions .",
    "the properties of layered and three - dimensional interacting electronic systems are typically described within the hubbard model . despite its simplicity",
    "this model allows , in particular , to explain rather complex phenomena originating from strong electron - electron interaction ( ferromagnetism , antiferromagnetism and superconductivity ) depending on the hopping parameters and electronic density .",
    "surprisingly that although the hubbard model has been studied for a long time , its magnetic phase diagram is not yet fully constructed even in the framework of the mean field ( mf ) approximation . traditionally , only the competition of ( collinear ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases was considered ( see , e. g. , ref . ) . while the antiferromagnetism is energetically favorable at half - filling in the regime of strong electronic correlations",
    ", nagaoka@xcite has argued that for three - dimensional hubbard model at small doping and infinitely large electronic on - site coulomb interaction @xmath20 the ground state is saturated - ferromagnetically ordered ; with decreasing @xmath20 the ferromagnetic state appears to be unstable .",
    "furthermore , khomskii considered the possibility of a canted magnetic state at finite @xmath20 , which is a superposition of ferro- and antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "such a state turns out to be , however , energetically unfavorable because of its instability with respect to phase separation ( ps ) . in particular , at large @xmath20 visscher @xcite obtained the existence of ps region of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states on the phase diagram and determined its location .",
    "the ps of these states was later extensively considered in refs . .",
    "it was shown@xcite that it is energetically favorable for conduction electrons to be localized in some ferromagnetic regions on the background of antiferromagnetically ordered local moments .",
    "such autolocalized states have been called ferrons @xcite .",
    "thus , the system gains in kinetic energy of electrons at the expense of loss in the local - moment subsystem energy .",
    "another type of instability of paramagnetic ( pm ) phase is the formation of incommensurate ( spiral ) magnetic structures in the ground state , which was studied in the last two decades for 2d itinerant systems @xcite . using the mf approximation , arrigoni and strinati considered the competition of diagonal and parallel spiral phases in the hubbard model with nearest neighbor hopping and found a first - order transition between them @xcite .",
    "applying the maxwell construction , these authors revealed the existence of spatial mixture of commensurate antiferromagnetic and incommensurate magnetic phases in some region of the phase diagram .",
    "chubukov and musaelian@xcite considered the effect of small doping on the magnetic structure of the hubbard model with finite next - nearest neighbor hopping and found that the diagonal spiral magnetic structure is unstable with respect to ps , while the parallel phase is stable . recently",
    "similar results were obtained within the @xmath21 model at small doping @xcite .",
    "the electronic correlations were investigated beyond the standard mf approximation within the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach for small @xmath20 , and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) for intermediate and large @xmath20 .",
    "the account of electronic correlations within the frg approach of the 2d hubbard model with nearest ( @xmath22 ) and next - nearest @xmath23 neighbor hopping in the vicinity of van hove filling @xcite showed that small values of @xmath24 favor the competition between antiferromagnetic and @xmath25-wave superconducting ordering @xcite .",
    "the incommensurate magnetic order was also shown to compete with both instabilities @xcite . within the dmft",
    "the magnetic phase diagram for the hubbard model was constructed on a bethe lattice with nearest @xcite and next - nearest neighbor hopping @xcite . for small @xmath26 the ps of antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases , as well as an incommensurate magnetic phase ( the region where commensurate solutions of the dmft equations do not exist ) ,",
    "were found .",
    "the ferromagnetic state was shown to compete with other instabilities in the 2d hubbard model for large @xmath24 ( refs . ) , being stable at low and moderate electronic densities @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that consideration of incommensurate magnetic fluctuations with small wave vectors significantly changes the boundary of ferromagnetic region on the phase diagram of 2d hubbard model@xcite , since this region is `` forced '' out by diagonal incommensurate order .",
    "therefore , the study of competition between ferromagnetic and incommensurate order acquires special importance in determining the conditions for the stability of the fm phase . taking into account incommensurate fluctuations and",
    "the shift of the chemical potential within the quasistatic approximation reveals that even at van hove filling , ferromagnetism can not be realized at arbitrarily small @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the frg calculations taking into consideration the electronic self - energy corrections @xcite also show the importance of incommensurate fluctuations near the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "the discussed variety of magnetic orders is expected to be strongly influenced by ps phenomenon . in previous studies",
    "this influence was not considered systematically .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to relate the possibilitity of phase separation to incommensurate order , and to construct the magnetic ground - state phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model on a square lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping within the mf approximation , including both possibilities .",
    "this problem is relevant in the context of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates as well as for ruthenate systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ formalism ] we consider possible types of magnetic ground states , present the derivation of mf approximation for spiral magnetic states and treat the formal aspects of the phase separation problem . in sect .",
    "[ phase ] we present the results of our phase diagram calculations .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the discussion of the results .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of the hubbard model on the square lattice @xmath27 where @xmath28 for the nearest - neighbor sites @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the next - nearest neighbors , @xmath31 is a creation ( annihilation ) electronic operator on site @xmath32 with the spin projection @xmath33 , @xmath20 is the electronic ( hubbard ) on - site interaction .",
    "fourier transformation of the hopping term yields the electronic spectrum @xmath34 where @xmath35 the lattice constant is taken equal to unity .",
    "the interacting part of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be represented in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( arbitrary chosen ) @xmath32-dependent unit vector and we introduce the site density @xmath38 and the site magnetization @xmath39 operators .    to demonstrate the peculiarities of competition between different magnetic states we first consider the limit of large @xmath20 . in this limit",
    "spatial separation into antiferromagnetically ordered regions with one electron per site and ferromagnetically ordered hole - rich regions is most preferable . to obtain the boundary of the ps region we modify visscher s arguments @xcite for",
    "the case of square lattice with nonzero next - nearest neighbor hopping ( in the derivation below we consider the case of electronic density @xmath40 ) .",
    "the saturated ferromagnetic phase has the energy @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hole density in the ferromagnetic region , and @xmath43 is the total number of holes , @xmath44 is the fermi function at zero temperature ( @xmath45 is the chemical potential , @xmath46 is the heaviside step function . note that @xmath42 actually depends on the number of antiferromagnetically ordered sites @xmath47 @xmath48 being the number of sites .",
    "the energy of the af region is @xmath49 minimizing the total energy @xmath50 with respect to @xmath51 , we obtain the equation for the ps region boundary ( determined from the condition @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electronic density ) @xmath55 where we include the generalization to the case of @xmath56 . therefore , for a given density @xmath54 and @xmath57 the homogeneous magnetic state is unstable with respect to ps of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states .",
    "however , for moderate values of @xmath20 incommensurate spiral magnetic states are expected to be important , and we have to account also for them .    to discuss the possibility of incommensurate order we apply the mf treatment of the interaction term ( [ h ] ) as follows @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 we choose @xmath37 directed along @xmath60 and assume that @xmath61 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ treat ] ) corresponds to the uniform charge mean field @xmath62 ( which can be interpreted as a shift of the chemical potential ) , the second term is the correction due to the site dependent mean magnetic field @xmath63 and the other terms correspond to the shift of the total energy .",
    "we consider the spiral type of incommensurate magnetic order , which is a superposition of the rotation of order parameter in the @xmath64-plane , modulated with some wave vector @xmath65 , and the ferromagnetic component perpendicular to the @xmath64-plane @xcite @xmath66 this generalizes the khomskii s idea @xcite of superposition of the fm and af ordering in the vicinity of half - filling .",
    "note that in this case only the direction , and not the magnitude of the magnetic moment , depends on the site number .",
    "this state can be contrasted to the collinear incommensurate spin - density wave state @xcite , where only the magnitude , not the direction , depends on the site number ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the spiral type of magnetic order , bearing in mind the intuitive argument that one gains more magnetic energy for the largest possible magnetization at every site .",
    "it is obvious that the mf thermodynamical potential ( tp ) @xmath68 $ ] ( where @xmath69 is the mf approximation for the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath70 is the particle number operator , @xmath71 is the temperature ) can be expressed through the tp of non - interacting electrons in the self - consistently determined charge and magnetic fields .",
    "it is convenient to write down the parameter dependence of tp explicitly @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the tp of non - interacting electrons in external charge and magnetic fields , calculated in the appendix .",
    "we find the preferable magnetic phase ( i.e. @xmath74 ) by minimizing @xmath75 ( [ omegamf_total ] ) with respect to these variables for a given chemical potential @xmath45 .",
    "we denote the values which provide this minimum as @xmath76 for a given magnetic structure specified by @xmath77 , the density @xmath54 and magnetization @xmath78 satisfy the mf equations @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are determined in the appendix ; the preferred values of @xmath83 can be then obtained from the minimization of tp .    in practice",
    "we determine the functions @xmath84 by using a rather dense grid for variables @xmath65 and @xmath85 to provide the minimum of @xmath75 numerically .",
    "( in fact we always have @xmath86 so that the ` ferromagnetic ' component introduced in ref .",
    "vanishes , therefore in the following we omit @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is necessary to keep in mind that we always have to account for the possibility of a paramagnetic solution with @xmath87 ( the solution with @xmath88 as a rule , is unique ) .",
    "note that we choose the chemical potential @xmath45 as a basic variable instead of the density @xmath54 , since this allows us to avoid technical problems connected with using the maxwell construction for first - order transitions ( see below ) .",
    "change to the @xmath54-dependence is easily given by the solution of mf equations .",
    "since the magnetization @xmath78 of the spiral phase can be expressed through @xmath45 and @xmath89 excluding @xmath78 we obtain the tp as a function of @xmath65 , so that the wave vector @xmath65 serves as an _ order parameter _ specifying the type of magnetic ordering , except for the transition to the pm phase , where the magnetic phase wave vector can not be specified .",
    "we classify spiral phases by the symmetry of the wave vector @xmath90 for the ferromagnetic phase , @xmath91 for the antiferromagnetic ( neel ) phase , @xmath92 for the parallel spiral phases , @xmath93 for the diagonal spiral phase ; we also consider the spiral magnetic phase with the wave vector @xmath94 ( we assume due to the symmetry @xmath95 that @xmath96 ) , where @xmath97 takes an arbitrary value in the range @xmath98 . for the pm phase @xmath87 and @xmath65 is not fixed .",

    "results in a jump in the magnetic structure parameters and a heterogeneous state appears . since the solution of the mf equations gives the density as a function of the chemical potential and wave vector @xmath65 , @xmath101 this transition leads to a jump @xmath102 as well .",
    "when @xmath54 is between @xmath103 and @xmath104 the system consists of two spatially separated phases with densities @xmath103 and @xmath105 in a volume proportion , which provides an average density equal to @xmath54 .",

    "( [ visscher ] ) for the hole - doped side of the phase diagram for large @xmath24 is much lower than that for the electron - doped side ( not plotted ) , which qualitatively agrees with the absence of fm on the electron - doped side .",
    "we have considered the ground - state magnetic phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model with nearest @xmath165 and next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath23 in the framework of the mf approximation ( see figs .",
    "2 , 3a , 4a ) .",
    "we have taken into account the possibility of both the incommensurate ( spiral ) order and the phase separation ( ps ) .",
    "we compared the thermodynamical potentials of different magnetic phases to determine the most preferable phase .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is rich due to the presence of spiral magnetic phases and ps , which has a dramatic effect on the phase diagram in the vicinity of the half - filling . in general , the diagonal incommensurate phase , which in some previous studies @xcite was found to be stable in the vicinity of half - filling for @xmath166 is replaced to a great extent by ps regions of different other magnetic phases .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches @xcite and in accordance with the exact results @xcite it was found that the pm phase does not take part in the ps ( but the magnetically ordered phases do , contrary to the results of refs . ) .",
    "therefore , the interplay of spiral magnetic states and ps phenomena is of crucial importance .",
    "the breaking of the particle - hole symmetry due to the finite next - nearest neighbor hopping term @xmath23 makes the phase diagram strongly asymmetric with respect to half - filling ( @xmath114 ) . at large @xmath20",
    "we have ps of collinear ferro- ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) states which agrees with the analytical large-@xmath20 result for the ps boundary line @xmath167 .",
    "for @xmath56 the boundary curve @xmath167 is much higher than for @xmath40 , and the fm region is replaced by regions of spiral phase for moderately large @xmath117 . with increasing @xmath24",
    "we observe the tendency to ferromagnetic and diagonal spiral magnetic ordering for @xmath40 and the tendency to parallel spiral ordering for @xmath56 .",
    "the phases in the vicinity of half - filling are fully unstable with respect to ps for @xmath40 , but the af region is found to be stable for @xmath56 , provided that @xmath168 .",
    "the theoretical issue concerning the ps of incommensurate magnetic states in the vicinity of half - filling can be related to the explanation of some features observed in the one - layer compound la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( ref . ) , in particular , the unusual dependence of the chemical potential on hole doping@xcite .",
    "our approach can be generalized to the hubbard model with bonding and antibonding bands , in order to model the electronic structure of double - layered compounds , in particular , to explain the significantly different magnetic behavior of yba@xmath11cu@xmath12o@xmath13 upon doping .",
    "we believe the ps phenomena should be taken into account in more complicated approaches which are used for strongly correlated electronic systems , e.  g. , cuprates .",
    "although the mf based approach provides a basic picture of magnetic ordering in the 2d hubbard model , it does not take into account the effect of fluctuations , and its application to explaining the magnetic behavior of cuprates should be performed with caution .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that for the first - order phase transitions fluctuations are not expected to change the obtained types of phases and to shift substantially the phase boundaries . at the same time , the phase transitions from magnetic to paramagnetic phase can be influenced more strongly by fluctuations .    trying to explain the ps phenomena in real compounds",
    ", it is impossible to avoid a consideration of additional long - range coulomb energy originating from electronic inhomogeneity that is not taken into account within the hubbard model . rigorously speaking",
    ", the hubbard model is applicable only provided that the dopant - site distribution coincides with the electronic inhomogeneity distribution , thereby canceling the long - range coulomb energy .",
    "if this cancellation is not perfect , the long - range coulomb energy , as well as the surface energy of ps regions should be considered .",
    "the problem of ps in realistic systems requires therefore further consideration .",
