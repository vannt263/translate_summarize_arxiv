    "among the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , bl lac objects represent a minority characterized by an almost featureless optical spectrum and by an intense `` blazar '' activity ( variability , flat radio spectrum , polarization ) . due to their scarcity , the study of bl lacs is not simple and many important issues , like the cosmological evolution , are not yet well understood .",
    "the first attempts to estimate the evolutionary behavior of bl lac objects were based on the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( mss , maccacaro et al . 1982 ) and its extension ( emss , gioia et al .",
    "evidence for negative evolution ( objects less numerous / luminous in the past than now ) was found ( maccacaro et al . 1984 ; wolter et al . 1991 ; morris et al . 1991 ; wolter et al . 1994 ; rector et al . 2000 ) . at the same time , the analysis of the 1 jy radio selected sample of bl lacs found a mildly positive evolution ( stickel et al .",
    "1991 ; rector & stocke 2001 ) at odds with the x - ray results . however , all these conclusions were based on small samples containing 2040 objects at most .",
    "the recent availability of large radio and x - ray surveys boosted the attempts at selecting large samples of bl lacs .",
    "different techniques are used in order to increase the efficiency of the selection process : a very efficient technique turned out to be the combination of radio and x - ray information thanks to the fact that bl lacs are both x - ray and radio loud sources as firstly pointed out by stocke et al .",
    "this technique reaches efficiencies of 15%30% ( e.g. wolter et al .",
    "1997 ) depending on the flux limits involved , while in a purely x - ray or radio survey the percentage of bl lacs hardly reaches 5% ( e.g. stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) . a radio survey of flat spectrum sources , like the 1  jy survey , has an efficiency of about 12% ( stickel et al . 1991 )",
    "although deeper flat spectrum radio surveys include higher percentages of bl lacs ( up to 20% in the 200  mjy sample , march et al .",
    "1996 and in the class blazar survey , march et al .",
    "2001 , caccianiga et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "thus , surveys based on the cross - correlation of radio and x - ray catalogs have been initiated ( the dxrbs survey , perlman et al .",
    "1998 , the rgb survey , laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 , the rex survey , maccacaro et al . 1998 ; caccianiga et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "so far , the general picture is still quite unclear . some surveys ( bade et al .",
    "1998 ; giommi , menna & padovani 1999 ; giommi et al .",
    "2001 ) find negative evolution but only for a restricted sub - set of the bl lac objects , namely the ones with a synchrotron emission peaked at high energies ( the high energy peaked bl lacs , hbl ) .",
    "a continuous trend , ranging from slightly positive evolution for the low energy peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) to strong negative evolution for hbl has been found also by rector & stocke ( 2001 ) after the re - analysis of the 1  jy and emss samples . at the same time , preliminary results from other surveys , like the dxrbs and the rex survey , are not finding any cosmological evolution , neither negative nor positive ( padovani 2001 ; caccianiga et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the cosmological evolution of bl lacs based on an almost ( 91% ) complete sample of 55 bl lacs created by imposing a relatively bright x - ray and optical cut on the rex survey .",
    "so far , this is the largest sample with a spectroscopic classification that is used to estimate the cosmological evolution of bl lacs .",
    "the sample is presented in section  2 while the statistical analysis is described in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we compare the result with those reported in the literature .",
    "finally , the discussion and the conclusion are presented in section  5 .",
    "the rex survey is the result of a positional cross - correlation between the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) at 1.4 ghz and an x - ray catalogue of about 17,000 serendipitous sources detected in 1202 pointed rosat pspc fields ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the good accuracy of the nvss ( vla ) positions is used to pinpoint the optical counterpart .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of the sample is in progress .",
    "so far , about 40% of the sample has been spectroscopically identified and some of the newly discovered objects have been already presented ( wolter , ruscica & caccianiga 1998 ; caccianiga et al .",
    "the identification strategy that we have always adopted is to observe x - ray bright sources first , so as to obtain a complete subsample ( of increasing size ) with a very high fraction of identified sources usable for statistical studies . at present , at the x - ray flux limit of 4@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 and considering only the objects with a blue magnitude brighter than 20.5@xmath8 the sample is almost completely identified ( identification rate of 91% ) .",
    "we have thus analyzed this complete sample , that we call x - ray bright rex ( xb - rex ) , with the main goal of studying the statistical properties of the bl lac objects .",
    "the incidence of the relatively bright x - ray cut - off on the final results is discussed in section  4 . despite the fact that the rex survey has been created by using pointed pspc images characterized by different exposure times and , thus , different flux limits , at the bright x - ray flux limit considered for the xb - rex sample the sky - coverage function is flat",
    ", i.e. the almost totality ( 99% ) of the surveyed area reaches the x - ray flux limit of 4@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the analysis of the sample which is characterized by a single x - ray , radio and optical flux limit .    in total",
    ", the xb - rex sample contains 239 objects .",
    "the magnitudes are preferentially taken from the apm ( automatic plate measuringapmcat/ ] ) database ( o magnitude ) or from the leda catalogue ( paturel et al .",
    "1996 ) . for about 10% of objects , for which no blue magnitude was available ,",
    "we have estimated it from the apm e magnitude or used the b magnitude found in the literature . in case of the bl lac objects presented in this paper ,",
    "the great majority of the magnitudes are derived from apm except for 4 objects where the magnitudes are taken from the literature .    in the xb - rex sample 91% of the objects ( 218 out of 239 ) are already identified , either from the literature or from our own spectroscopy . in total , 55 bl lac objects ( 25% of the identified objects ) , 95 emission line agns ( el agn ) and 66 objects classified as `` galaxies '' are found .",
    "the complete sample of 55 bl lacs is reported in table  2 .",
    "in addition , two objects that are classified as stars are probably spurious optical counterparts and should be rejected from the sample ( the real counterpart is likely to be fainter than the optical limit used for the xb - rex sample ) .",
    "the classification of the different classes follows the rules described in paper  i. in case of bl lac objects , we have used the `` expanded '' definition based on the ca ii contrast at 4000  ( @xmath9 ) which must be below 40% instead of 25% as firstly proposed by stocke et al .",
    "this modification is justified by the evidence that the limit of 25% is too restrictive and can miss some true bl lac objects ( march et al .",
    "1996 , laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 , rector et al .",
    "2000 ) . in principle",
    ", this criterion may introduce in the sample some `` optically passive '' galaxies for which @xmath9 is low due , for instance , to a particular evolutionary stage of the galaxy rather than to the presence of a bl lac nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , we have estimated ( see paper  i ) that the percentage of `` normal '' galaxies in the sample of bl lacs defined according to the above definitions should be less than 10% , which means less than 5 spurious objects in the sample .",
    "a vla survey of the bl lacs and `` optically passive '' galaxies discovered in the rex survey is in progress and should provide a compelling tool to separate bl lac nuclei from `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "the redshift distribution of the 37 bl lac objects for which a redshift has been measured is presented in figure  1 .    by assuming that the percentage of bl lacs among the unidentified objects is the same as for the identified sources ( i.e. 25% ) we expect that only 5 bl lacs will be found after the completion of the identification process .",
    "this number is in complete agreement with the one computed by comparing the overall spectral energy distribution of the unidentified objects with that of the 55 bl lacs . through this comparison",
    "we predict only 34 missing bl lacs .",
    "given the small number of the expected missing objects , the conclusions of the analysis presented in this paper are not likely to change after the completion of the identification process .",
    "@xmath10 + @xmath11 + = 3.5 mm fig .",
    "1. the redshift distribution of the 37 bl lac objects in the xb - rex sample with a spectroscopic measured redshift .",
    "the high identification level of the xb - rex sample allows us to apply the @xmath0 test extended to the multifrequency selected samples ( avni & bachall 1980 ) .",
    "this test checks the uniformity of the spatial distribution of the objects in a flux - limited sample . a departure from a uniform distribution is interpreted as due to an evolutionary behavior of the population under study . for each object ,",
    "the two volumes @xmath12 and @xmath13 are derived on the basis of the observed redshift ( z ) and the maximum redshift ( z@xmath14 ) at which the object would produce a flux equal to the flux limit of the survey . since the xb - rex is characterized by 3 flux limits , the most stringent value of z@xmath14 is considered , i.e. :    z@xmath14 = min ( z@xmath15 , z@xmath16 , z@xmath17 )    where z@xmath15 , z@xmath16 , z@xmath17 are the maximum redshifts obtained respectively in the radio , optical and x - ray band . if the @xmath0 values are not uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , there are indications for either an evolutionary behavior of the population under study or for the presence of selection effects biasing the sample . in particular",
    "the first requirement for a uniform distribution is that the average of the @xmath0 values is consistent with 0.5 .",
    "the effective uniformity of the distribution must then be checked with , for instance , a kolmogorov - smirnov test . by using the sample of 55 bl lac ,",
    "we have computed the @xmath0 values for each source . for the objects without a redshift , we have assumed z=0.27 ( which is the mean redshift of the sample ) .",
    "we have also assumed @xmath18 = 0 and @xmath19 = 1 for the spectral indices in the radio and in the x - ray band , respectively . in the optical band ,",
    "bl lacs show a wide range of spectral indices , with radio selected bl lacs being steeper than x - ray selected bl lacs ( falomo , scarpa & bersanelli 1994 ) .",
    "since the majority of our sources are more similar to the x - ray selected objects , we have used the mean value found by falomo , scarpa & bersanelli ( 1994 ) for these sources ( @xmath20 = 0.65 ) .",
    "the resulting value of the @xmath21 , reported in tab .  1 ( @xmath21=0.484@xmath220.039 )",
    ", is fully consistent with 0.5 . the k - s test shows that the @xmath0 values are consistent with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 ( probability=76.3% ) .    in order to check the stability of the results , we have performed the analysis under different assumptions .",
    "if we assume , for all the objects without a redshift determination , the values taken from the extremes of the observed redshift distribution ( fig  1 ) , i.e. 0.1 and 0.7 , we obtain @xmath21 = 0.47 and 0.50 ( @xmath220.039 ) respectively .",
    "thus , the result is not significantly affected by the number of objects without a redshift determination .",
    "the @xmath0 analysis may also be affected by a wrong assumption on the spectral slope .",
    "the expression used for the k - correction ( @xmath23 ) , based on the assumption of a power - law spectrum with spectral index @xmath24 , can mimic a luminosity evolution ( or cancel a real one ) if the value of @xmath24 is over or underestimated . by assuming extreme values for the @xmath24 in the 3 bands , namely @xmath19=0.5 , @xmath18=0.5 , @xmath20=0.0 and @xmath19=2 , @xmath18=1 , @xmath20=2 , the @xmath21 values range from 0.47 to 0.52 .",
    "we conclude that the k - correction does not play a fundamental role in the analysis unless very extreme ( and unrealistic ) values of @xmath24 are used",

    "2000 ) , @xmath19 = 1 and @xmath20 = 0.65 .",
    "the result is indicative of a strong positive evolution ( @xmath21=0.630@xmath220.030 ) .",
    "we have then estimated the evolution by assuming a pure luminosity evolution of the form : @xmath34 under the hypothesis that the values of @xmath35 in the three bands ( radio , optical and x - ray ) are the same .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath363.0 with a 1@xmath32 interval of ( 2.5 , 3.3 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is intermediate between that found for the x - ray selected ( @xmath35=2.92 , della ceca et al .",
    "1994 ) and the optically selected ( e.g. @xmath35=3.49 , padovani 1993 ) radio - loud agns .",
    "both values are consistent within 1@xmath32 with the one found in the xb - rex sample .",
    "the absence of cosmological evolution in bl lacs is potentially at odds with the results presented in the literature , claiming the existence of negative evolution ( morris et al . 1991 ; wolter et al .",
    "1994 ; bade et al . 1998 ; giommi , menna & padovani 1999 ; rector et al .",
    "2000 ) or a positive evolution ( stickel et al . 1991 ; rector & stocke 2001 ) . assuming a luminosity evolution of the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the look - back time , our result is consistent , at 1@xmath32 confidence level , with a value of @xmath39 between + 2.0 and 3.5 .",
    "thus , both the negative ( @xmath39=7.0 , wolter et al .",
    "1994 ) and positive ( @xmath39=3.1 , stickel et al .",
    "1991 ) best - fit parameters found in the literature fall outside the 1@xmath32 range .",
    "it can be argued that the negative evolution of bl lacs is not visible in the xb - rex sample simply because this sample is not deep enough .",
    "the flux limit of 4@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band corresponds to a flux limit of 7.2@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in the 0.33.5 kev band ( which is the emss energy band ) assuming @xmath40=1 .",
    "this flux is higher than the lowest limit reached by the emss complete sample ( 5@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 ) used by morris et al .",
    "( 1991)10@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 is actually reached only by a fraction ( 58% ) of the area covered by the emss survey .",
    "the flux limit corresponding to the 90% of the area is much higher ( @xmath72.5@xmath210@xmath41 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 ) ] .",
    "the flux limit of the xb - rex is thus in the region where the bl lac logn - logs measured in emss survey ( wolter et al . 1991 ) starts to flatten .",
    "thus , the negative evolution found in the emss sample might simply not be observable in the xb - rex sample .    in order to verify this hypothesis",
    "we have analyzed a simulated sample ( see paper  i ) created under the assumption of negative evolution of the exponential form given by eq .  1 with the best - fit value of @xmath42 found by wolter et al .",
    "if we apply the @xmath0 analysis to the entire simulated sample and we compute the evolutionary parameter , we find a best - fit value of @xmath436.8 , i.e. in excellent agreement with the input value .",
    "this first test demonstrates the validity of the method when applied to a multifrequency survey .    if we apply to the simulated sample the same radio , optical and x - ray flux limits used for the xb - rex , the resulting sample contains 65 objects .",
    "this number is in excellent agreement with the observed number of objects if we consider that 10% of the objects are expected to be missed in the positional radio / x - ray correlation as explained in paper  i and an additional 9% is expected to be missed due to the identification level ( 91% ) achieved so far in the xb - rex sample .",
    "considering these corrections , the number of bl lacs expected in the xb - rex sample is about 0.9@xmath20.91@xmath265 = 53 that should be compared with the observed number of 55 .",
    "the @xmath21 analysis of the simulated sample shows the presence of the negative evolution ( @xmath21= 0.423 @xmath22 0.036 , see tab .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is not uniform although the ks test rejects the hypothesis of no - evolution only marginally ( probability of 9.7% ) . by assuming the same form of the evolution used as input for the simulations , we obtain a best - fit value ( @xmath39=4.5 with 1@xmath32 range of 7.2 , 2.2 ) which is lower than the input value ( 7.0 ) although consistent at 1@xmath32 .",
    "thus , the negative evolution is recovered but it is weaker than the one given as input .",
    "this result is probably due to the fact that , as the flux limit increases , the negative evolution becomes less and less evident since the euclidean part of the logn - logs is sampled .    in conclusion",
    "our simulations show that , at the x - ray flux limit of the xb - rex sample , the negative evolution seen in the emss sample should be less extreme but still detectable . the result of the analysis presented here may indicate that , if present , the negative evolution is weaker than that estimated from the emss sample .",
    "we have presented the result of the @xmath0 test on a sample of 55 bl lacs extracted from the rex survey .",
    "no evidence of positive or negative evolution is found .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is rather stable , i.e. it is not affected much by the fact that some sources do not have a redshift determination ( indeed , the @xmath0 test does not depend very much on the redshift of the sources ) .",
    "simulations based on the emss sample has demonstrated that , at the x - ray flux limit of the xb - rex sample , the negative evolution found by wolter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is expected to be less evident although still detectable .",
    "more puzzling is the discrepancy between the results found in the xb - rex sample and the strong negative evolution presented in bade et al .",
    "since the rass sample has a higher x - ray flux limit than the xb - rex sample , the strong negative evolution found in the rass sample should have been clearly detected in our analysis .",
    "a possible explanation of this apparent contradiction is that the evolutionary behavior is not the same for all the different sub - classes of bl lacs . as suggested by different authors",
    ", there may be a continuous trend of the evolutionary properties within the bl lac class , with the most extreme hbls evolving negatively , from one side , and the most extreme lbls evolving positively , from the other side .",
    "depending on the flux limit(s ) of a given survey and/or to its selection criteria , a sample may contain a different percentage of hbls and lbls and this can produce different results in the @xmath0 analysis . in figure  2",
    "the @xmath44 distribution of the 55 bl lacs selected in the xb - rex sample ( tick line ) is presented and compared to the same distribution for the emss ( shaded histogram on the left side ) , the 1  jy ( filled histogram on the right side ) and the rass ( dashed line ) bl lac samples .",
    "it is clear that the xb - rex bl lacs are covering a range of @xmath44 which is similar to that observed in the x - ray selected samples ( emss and rass ) although it does not reach the very low end of the distribution ( @xmath450.5 ) .",
    "hence , we may expect qualitatively that the evolutionary behavior of the xb - rex bl lacs is similar to that observed in the x - ray selected samples but less extreme since the very low @xmath44 objects are not included in the sample . since we do not observe evidence for evolution even when we consider the objects with @xmath290.62 ,",
    "the conclusion is that the extreme negative evolution must be carried out mainly by the minority of the objects with @xmath44 most extreme , not selected in our sample .",
    "surveys more specifically designed to find the extreme hbls , like the sedentary multifrequency survey , should be in the best position to observe the signs of a negative evolution ( giommi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath10 + @xmath11 + = 3.5 mm fig .",
    "2. the radio - to - x - ray spectral index ( @xmath44 ) distribution of the bl lac objects in different samples : xb - rex ( tick line ) , emss ( shaded histogram on the left side ) , 1jy ( filled histogram on the right side ) and rass ( dashed line )    in any case , the analysis presented in this paper confirms that bl lac objects do not follow the same evolutionary behavior of the emission line agns .",
    "possible explanations for this difference have been recently proposed by cavaliere & malquori ( 1999 ) on the basis of a different accretion rate on the central massive black - hole : bl lac objects may be characterized by a low accretion rate ( @xmath4610@xmath47 ) that produces a very mild luminosity evolution in contrast with what happens in the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , where the accretion is close to the eddington limit ( @xmath481 ) producing a much faster luminosity evolution .",
    "the predicted time scale for the luminosity evolution in the bl lac population is expected to give a @xmath21 consistent with 0.5 , as observed in the xb - rex sample .",
    "superimposed to this effect , a possible transition from a fsrq into a bl lac object , due to a reduction of the accretion rate at low redshifts , may cause negative ( density ) evolution in bl lac objects ( objects more numerous now than at high redshift ) as described in cavaliere & delia ( 2001 ) .",
    "a similar evolutionary link between fsrq and bl lac has been proposed by bttcher & dermer ( 2001 ) where the reduction of the black - hole accretion power with time may switch a fsrq into a bl lac object following the sequence fsrq@xmath49lbl@xmath49hbl . as discussed before",
    ", the analysis of the xb - rex sample indicates that only a mild negative evolution is consistent with the data although only a narrow range of bl lac `` flavors '' is actually covered in this sample ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "after the completion of identification process of the entire rex survey , which contains 7 times more sources than the xb - rex sub - sample , a wider range of bl lac types will be covered allowing a more complete study of the evolutionary behaviors within the bl lac class .",
