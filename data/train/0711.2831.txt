    "dwarf novae are a sub - class of cataclysmic variables which contain a roche - lobe filling secondary star and an accreting white dwarf ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "dwarf nova outbursts are characterized with amplitudes of 25  mag and durations of a few days .",
    "su  uma - type stars are dwarf novae showing two types of outbursts , that is , normal outbursts and superoutbursts which have longer durations ( @xmath3@xmath4  d ) and amplitudes @xmath5 larger than those of normal outbursts .",
    "superoutbursts are characterized by the appearance of periodic short - term modulations , called `` superhumps '' , whose period is slightly longer than the orbital period ( @xcite ) .",
    "dwarf nova outbursts are caused by a sudden increase of mass - accretion rate in an accretion disk .",
    "the most widely accepted theory for su  uma stars is the thermal  tidal instability model for the accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal instability model considers two kinds of thermally stable states of the disk , that is , a cool disk of neutral hydrogen gas and a hot disk of ionized hydrogen gas , corresponding to the quiescent and outburst states , respectively .",
    "according to the disk instability model , the cool disk becomes thermally unstable when the density of the accumulated gas reaches a critical value .",
    "the disk , then , experiences a state transition to the hot disk , observed as an outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the outburst leads to an expansion of the disk . in the case",
    "that the disk has an enough angular momentum , its outer edge reaches the 3:1 resonance radius , which triggers the tidal instability ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk becomes eccentric , as a result , the strong tidal torque yields an additional dissipation of the angular momentum in the disk , which leads to superoutbursts . because of the eccentricity of the disk ,",
    "periodic modulations associated with the orbital motion of the secondary star are expected .",
    "they are actually observed as superhumps .",
    "the superhump period is longer than orbital periods due to the precession of the eccentricity wave ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk instability model can explain several basic behaviors of ordinary dwarf novae , for example , their frequency of outbursts and two kinds of outbursts in su  uma stars ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this standard model is , however , required to be modified in order to reproduce rebrightenings after superoutbursts which are observed in several su  uma stars .",
    "a peculiar subclass , wz  sge - type dwarf novae , in particular , tend to exhibit various types of rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wz  sge - type stars have shortest orbital periods ( @xmath6 ) and longest outburst cycles ( @xmath7 ) among dwarf novae . based on characteristics of light curves , rebrightenings can be divided into three types ; i )  a single short rebrightening ( rz  leo , @xcite ; asas  j002511@xmath01217.2 , @xcite ) , ii )  repetitive short rebrightenings , or sometimes called `` echo outbursts '' ( wz  sge , @xcite ; eg  cnc , @xcite , @xcite ; sdss  j080434.20@xmath0520349.2 , @xcite ) , and iii ) a long - lived plateau ( al  com , @xcite , @xcite ; cg  cma , @xcite ; tss  j022216.4@xmath0412259.9 , @xcite ; v2176  cyg , @xcite ) . additionally to wz",

    "several wz  sge stars show no sign of rebrightenings ( hv vir , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of rebrightenings and the origin of their diversity are poorly understood . in a simple picture based on the disk instability model , most of the mass and angular momentum",
    "are lost from the disk by the end of superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long - lived rebrightening phase is problematic because it apparently requires an unknown delayed mass - accretion even after the termination of superoutbursts when the disk should nearly be empty ( @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be reconciled if a mass - transfer rate from the secondary is enhanced due to the irradiation by the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario , however , has a difficulty to reproduce sudden onset and cessation of the rebrightening phase ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "propose an alternative scenario that a considerable amount of matter left over the 3:1 resonance radius is responsible for the delayed accretion .",
    "the remnants at the outermost region is expected to work as a mass reservoir , leading to the additional mass accretion during the rebrightening phase ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of the outermost region of the accretion disk , hence , definitely provides crucial clues for the rebrightening phenomenon .",
    "infrared ( ir ) observations can be a strong tool to detect variations from a low temperature region at the outermost accretion disk .",

    "our observation of j1021 during the rebrightening indicates that it had no entire hot disk , but had a two - component disk , namely a hot inner disk and a cool or transitional state disk at the outermost part .",
    "such a simultaneous presence of hot and cool disks could be problematic for the thermal instability model .",
    "in the previous section , we reported the ir activity during the rebrightening phase of j1021 .",
    "the uniqueness of its ir behavior among su  uma stars are , however , unclear due to the lack of enough samples for ir observations during dwarf nova outbursts . @xcite reported optical and ir observations during a superoutburst of an ordinary su  uma - type dwarf nova , oy  car . in this paper ,",
    "optical and ir superhumps have similar amplitudes , that is , @xmath76  mag both in @xmath70- and @xmath11-bands .",
    "they are consistent with the classical picture of the accretion disk in dwarf nova outbursts , in which a superhump source having 800010000  k lies at the outermost part of the disk having @xmath77  k. the ir behavior of oy  car is totally different from that observed in the rebrightening phase of j1021 . to date , this observation of oy  car is all information about ir behavior during superoutbursts . about j1021 ,",
    "furthermore , we have no ir data during the main outburst which should be compared with those during the rebrightening . in order to reveal the nature of the ir active region , future ir observations are required during superoutbursts and rebrightenings of ordinary su  uma and other wz  sge stars .      in the previous section",
    ", we calculated the color temperatures of superhump sources from observed colors . as a result",
    ", we obtained low color temperatures , which were rather close to those observed at quiescence .",
    "the color temperature provides a good approximation if the source is optically thick . in dwarf novae , however , the optical light from the accretion disk at quiescence is , in general , dominated by the optically thin emission ( @xcite , and references therein ) . even in outbursts ,",
    "the continuum radiation at the outermost region is predicted to be optically thin ( @xcite ) . in the case of j1021 during the rebrightening , the temperature of the ir superhumps was rather close to the quiescent one , although the entire disk luminosity was still high .",
    "the radiation mechanism of the ir superhump is , hence , less obvious .",
    "if the ir emission is optically thin , the color temperatures of the low temperature region in table  [ tab : bbsim ] may have no complete validity as an indicator of real temperatures .",
    "we , then , need to solve the radiation transfer in the disk in order to reproduce the observed light curves , which is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "results of such a full calculation , on the other hand , have only little influence on our order - of - magnitude discussion .",
    "ir spectroscopic observations are required to conclude whether the outer low temperature region is optically thin or thick during the rebrightening phase .      among 5 systems showing long plateau - type rebrightenings ,",
    "3 systems exhibit a precursor just before their rebrightening maximum , as mentioned in  3.2 . in ordinary su",
    "uma stars , precursors are occasionally observed just before supermaxima .",
    "they are interpreted as a normal outburst triggering a subsequent superoutburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "after the precursor maximum , the object starts a rapid fading since it takes a few days for the full evolution of the tidal instability .",
    "when the tidal dissipation begins working effectively , the rapid fading is terminated by a rising trend toward the supermaxima .",
    "the similar mechanism may also work in the structure of the long plateau - type rebrightening .",
    "light curves between precursors and rebrightening maxima are , however , peculiar in wz  sge stars compared with the precursor  supermaximum structure in ordinary su  uma stars .",
    "several wz  sge stars keep a gradually rising trend after initial rapid risings of rebrightenings .",
    "al  com and v2176  cyg , for example , reached the maximum of rebrightenings @xmath78 and @xmath79 after the precursors , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "tss  j022216.4@xmath0412259.9 is an extreme case , in which a gradual rising apparently continued for @xmath80 until the rebrightening maximum ( @xcite ) .",
    "this characteristic is clearly different from that observed in ordinary superoutbursts in which objects reach their supermaximum within a day after the onset of outbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "while j1021 shows no delay of the rebrightening maximum , we discuss the delayed maximum in terms of the mass reservoir at the outermost part of the disk .    according to the disk instability model",
    ", the rising speed corresponds to the propagation speed of the heating wave in the hot disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the delayed rebrightening maximum is possibly attributed to a late propagation of the heating wave into the outer mass reservoir , namely the ir active region .",
    "if the ir superhump observed in j1021 is a characteristic feature for the rebrightening phase , however , this scenario is unlikely because it would yield an entire hot disk and prominent optical superhumps .",
    "another possible scenario for the delayed rebrightening maximum is that the inner hot disk continuously receives a sufficient amount of gas from the outer mass reservoir . in the case of j1021 ,",
    "the tidal dissipation effectively works at the outer low temperature region as demonstrated by the ir superhumps .",
    "we can , thus , naturally expect a significant mass accretion from the outer cool to the inner hot part of the disk .      during the rebrightening phase , the @xmath2-band flux exhibited a clear excess over the blackbody component which dominated between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 ranges , as mentioned in  3.3 .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the @xmath2-band light curve is a relatively rapid evolution compared with @xmath10- and @xmath11-band ones .",
    "the @xmath10- and @xmath11-band emission is presumably dominated by the optically thick emission from the disk .",
    "the evolution time - scale of them is a viscous diffusion time - scale of the hot optically thick disk .",
    "the time - scale becomes longer in an outer , in other words , lower temperature region of the disk .",
    "the rapid evolution of the @xmath2-band emission is , thereby , inconsistent with the theory of optically thick disk .",
    "it implies that the @xmath2-band emission is not from an optically thick disk , but an optically thin region which is located outside the optically thick disk .",
    "the source of the @xmath2-band emission might be expelled from the optically thick disk at the onset of the rebrightening as a result of a rapid expansion of the hot disk .",
    "the periodic modulations during the early fading tail has a slightly shorter period than the superhumps , as can be seen from figures  [ fig : pdm ] and [ fig : o - c ] .",
    "the nature of the shorter period modulations is unclear .",
    "the period is possibly the orbital period of j1021 .",
    "if it is the case , the superhump excess @xmath81 is calculated to be @xmath82 .",
    "the empirical relationship between the @xmath83 and the mass ratio of binary systems reported in @xcite yields the mass ratio of @xmath84 for j1021 .",
    "the @xmath83 and the mass ratio are the smallest one among previously known dwarf novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "j1021 is possibly the most evolved dwarf novae if the period of the modulations in the fading tail indicate the orbital period .",
    "an alternative possibility is that they are late superhumps .",
    "late superhumps are periodic modulations appearing just after superoutbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their period is in agreement with a superhump period , while their profile is @xmath54 phase shifted from that of superhumps . in the case of j1021",
    ", we can not confirm a clear phase shift in figure  [ fig : o - c ] .",
    "we , however , consider that the late superhump scenario is more plausible because the long fading tail indicates an effective tidal dissipation , in which we can expect a long - lived eccentric disk and the superhump periodicity .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : o - c ] , @xmath56s of humps are apparently changed smoothly from the main outburst to the rebrightening and the early fading tail .",
    "this also supports the late superhump scenario .",
    "our observation of j1021 detected superhumps with a period of @xmath1 .",
    "the object experienced a long plateau - type rebrightening after the main superoutburst , which is observed only in wz  sge - type dwarf novae . in conjunction with the short superhump period ,",
    "we conclude that j1021 is a new member of wz  sge stars .",
    "we , furthermore , revealed ir behaviors for the first time during rebrightening phases of wz  sge stars .",
    "j1021 exhibited unprecedented ir activities , namely the @xmath2-band excess and the ir superhump .",
    "the ir superhump , in particular , indicates the presence of a substantial amount of remnant matter at the outermost region of the accretion disk even after the main superoutburst .",
    "we propose that this outer low temperature region is responsible for maintaining a hot state of the inner disk during the rebrightening .",
