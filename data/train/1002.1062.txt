    "recently , verlinde @xcite presented a remarkable new idea that gravity can be explained as an entropic force caused by the information changes when a material body moves away from the holographic screen .",
    "this idea implies that gravity is not fundamental . with the holographic principle and the equipartition law of energy",
    ", verlinde showed that newton s law of gravitation can arise naturally and unavoidably in a theory in which space is emergent through a holographic scenario , and a relativistic generalization leads to the einstein equations .",
    "in fact , the similar idea can be traced back to sakharov s work @xcite . on the other side , using the equipartition law of energy for the horizon degrees of freedom together with the thermodynamic relation @xmath3 , padmanabhan also obtained the newton s law of gravity @xcite .",
    "subsequently , with the idea of entropic force , some applications have been carried out .",
    "the friemdann equations and the modified friedmann equations for friedmann - robertson - walker universe in einstein gravity @xcite , @xmath4 gravity @xcite , deformed horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , and braneworld scenario @xcite were derived with the help of holographic principle and the equipartition rule of energy .",
    "the newtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the coulomb force was regarded as an entropic force . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the holographic dark energy can be derived from the entropic force formula .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that verlinde s entropic force is actually the consequence of a specific microscopic model of spacetime .",
    "the similar ideas were also applied to the construction of holographic actions from black hole entropy @xcite . while ref .",
    "@xcite showed that gravity has a quantum informational origin .    on the other hand ,",
    "a modified entropic force in the debye s model was gave in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of the problems of verlinde s proposal on the thermodynamical origin of the principle of relativity was presented , and the thermodynamic origin of the principle of relativity was explained by hidden symmetries of thermodynamics .",
    "other applications can be seen in @xcite .    according to verlinde s idea ,",
    "the holographic screens locate at equipotential surfaces , where the potential is defined by a timelike killing vector .",
    "then the local temperature on a screen can be defined by the acceleration of a particle that is located very close to the screen .",
    "the energy on the screen is calculated by the holographic principle and the equipartition rule of energy @xmath5 with @xmath6 the bit density of information on the screen . in this paper",
    ", we apply these formulas to investigate the temperature and energy on holographic screens for 4-dimensional static spherically symmetric and the kerr black hole , and look for experiment methods for testing the entropic force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we review verlinde s idea about the temperature and the energy from an entropic force in general relativity .",
    "then , with the idea of entropic force together with the equipartition law of energy , we calculate the temperature and the energy for 4-dimensional static spherically symmetric black holes and the kerr black hole in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we give a brief discussion and present that the entropic force could be tested by experiments .",
    "we first review the idea of verlinde about the temperature and the energy from an entropic force in general relativity .",
    "consider a static background with a global time like killing vector @xmath7 .",
    "one can relate the choice of this killing vector field with the temperature and the energy .    in order to define the temperature ,",
    "we first need to introduce the potential @xmath8 via the timelike killing vector @xmath7 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 satisfies the killing equation @xmath11 the redshift factor is denoted by @xmath12 and it relates the local time coordinate to that at a reference point with @xmath13 , which we will take to be at infinity .",
    "the potential is used to define a foliation of space , and the holographic screens are put at surfaces of constant redshift .",
    "so the entire screen has the same time coordinate .",
    "the four velocity @xmath14 and the acceleration @xmath15 of a particle that is located very close to the screen can be expressed in terms of the killing vector @xmath7 as @xmath16 note that because the acceleration is the gradient of the potential , it is perpendicular to screen @xmath17 .",
    "so we can turn it into a scalar quantity by contracting it with a unit outward pointing vector @xmath18 normal to the screen @xmath17 and to @xmath7 . with the normal vector @xmath19 , the local temperature @xmath20 on the screen",
    "is defined by @xmath21 where a redshift factor @xmath12 is inserted because the temperature @xmath20 is measured with respect to the reference point at infinity .",
    "we will call the temperature defined in ( [ t ] ) as unruh - verlinde temperature .",
    "assuming that the change of entropy at the screen is @xmath22 for a displacement by one compton wavelength normal to the screen , one has @xmath23 now the entropic force , which is required to keep a particle with mass @xmath24 at fixed position near the screen , is turned out to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the relativistic analogue of newton s acceleration , and the additional factor @xmath12 is due to the redshift , which is a consequence of the entropy gradient .",
    "we now consider a holographic screen on a closed surface of constant redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the number of bit @xmath27 of the screen is assumed to proportional to the area of the screen and is given by @xcite @xmath28 then , by assuming that each bit on the holographic screen contributes an energy @xmath29 to the system , and by using the equipartition law of energy , we get @xmath30 with @xmath6 the bit density on the screen . inserting the expressions of @xmath20 and @xmath27 into ( [ energy_a ] ) results in @xmath31    in the following , we will calculate the unruh - verlinde temperature and the energy on holographic screens for 4-dimensional black holes with static spherically symmetric metric and stationary axisymmetric metric , respectively .",
    "we first consider the case of 4-dimensional general static spherically symmetric black holes . in the general case",
    ", the metric can be taken as the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the metric on a unit 2-sphere .",
    "we assume @xmath34 for ensuring that the metric is asymptotically flat .",
    "the event horizon radius @xmath35 is usually determined by the largest solution of @xmath36 .    by using the killing equation @xmath37 and the static spherically symmetric properties of the metric ( [ general1 ] ) @xmath38 as well as the condition @xmath39 at infinity ,",
    "the timelike killing vector of the general black hole is solved as @xmath40 which is zero at the event horizon .    according to ( [ phi ] ) , ( [ amu ] ) and",
    "( [ t ] ) , the potential , the acceleration and the unruh - verlinde temperature on the holographic screen put at the spherical surface with radius @xmath41 are calculated as in the first version of our manuscript . ]",
    "@xmath42 the energy on the screen is @xmath43    next , we focus on the schwarzschild black hole and the rn black hole .      for the schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the metric has the form of ( [ general1 ] ) with @xmath44 the event horizon of the balk hole is located at @xmath45 , and the hawking temperature @xmath46 on the event horizon is given by @xmath47    the acceleration and the unruh - verlinde temperature on the screen are calculated as @xmath48 note that the unruh - verlinde temperature on the event horizon @xmath49 is just the hawking temperature @xmath46 : @xmath50 then , with the expressions ( [ e_spherically ] ) and ( [ f(r)_schwarz ] ) , we obtain the energy on the screen : @xmath51 it is interesting to note that this energy is independent of the radius of the screen .",
    "in fact this is a consequence of the gauss law .      as an important example of spherically symmetric black holes , the rn black hole has the metric form of ( [ general1 ] ) with @xmath52 there are two horizons , the event horizon with radius @xmath53 and the cauchy horizon with radius @xmath54 , where @xmath55 the extremal rn black hole corresponds to the case @xmath56 or , equivalently , @xmath57 .",
    "the hawking temperatures @xmath58 on the horizons are @xmath59    the potential , the acceleration and the unruh - verlinde temperature on the screen read @xmath60 on the horizons @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 which shows that the unruh - verlinde temperatures on both the horizons equal to the hawking temperatures @xmath58 . the solution of @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "so for @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 , the maximum of @xmath20 in the range @xmath67 is at @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , the maximum of @xmath20 in the range @xmath67 is at @xmath70 and is given by @xmath71    the energy on the screen is @xmath72 which is the well - known komar energy of the rn black hole .",
    "now this energy is dependent on the radius of the screen , which is also a consequence of the gauss laws of gravity and electrostatics .",
    "for the screen at infinity , the energy is reduced to that of the schwarzschild black hole : @xmath73 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the energies on the horizons @xmath74 are the same : @xmath75    for the extremal rn black hole with @xmath76 , the corresponding unruh - verlinde temperature and energy are @xmath77 they vanish at the horizon @xmath78 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the statements that the extremal black hole has a unique internal state @xcite and its temperature is zero due to the vanishing of surface gravity on horizon .",
    "in this section , we extend this work to the kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr solution describes both the stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat gravitational field outside a massive rotating body and a rotating black hole with mass and angular momentum .",
    "the kerr black hole can also be viewed as the final state of a collapsing star , uniquely determined by its mass and rate of rotation . moreover ,",
    "its thermodynamical behavior is very different from the schwarzschild black hole and the rn black hole , because of its much more complicated causal structure .",
    "hence its study is of great interest in understanding physical properties of astrophysical objects , as well as in checking any conjecture about thermodynamical properties of black holes .    in terms of boyer ",
    "lindquist coordinates , the euclidean kerr metric reads @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the kerr horizon function @xmath81 and @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the angular momentum for unit mass as measured from the infinity ; it vanishes in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "the nonextremal kerr black hole has the event horizon @xmath84 and the cauchy horizon @xmath54 at @xmath85 the extreme case corresponds to @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "the hawking temperatures on the horizons are @xmath88    the solution for the timelike killing vector @xmath10 is read as @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding potential is @xmath91 which shows that equipotential surfaces are dependent with two parameters @xmath41 and @xmath92 , hence the holographic screens are not spherically symmetric but axisymmetric .",
    "however , when @xmath93 or @xmath94 , the holographic screens are approximate spherically symmetric , which can be seen from the contour plots of the potential @xmath8 in the @xmath95-@xmath96 plane showed in figs . [",

    "hence , outside the horizons , the unruh - verlinde temperature @xmath20 can be considered as a generalized hawking temperature on the holographic screen . for the kerr black case , we also consider @xmath20 as the generalized hawking temperature . on the screen located at the infinity , the surface gravity or the acceleration of a particle ( which is free there ) vanishes , hence the temperature is zero .    the entropic force ( [ fmu ] ) for a static spherically symmetric black hole can be calculated as @xmath112 .",

    "note that , since @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 . similarly , the angular momentum of the kerr black hole will also affect the structure of the spacetime near the event horizon .",
    "the entropic force of the kerr black hole is read as @xmath121 and @xmath122 at @xmath68 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "it also reduces at large @xmath41 to the newton force because the effect of the  field \" caused by the angular momentum of the black hole becomes weaker with the increase of @xmath41 .",

    "the energy is naturally equal to the black hole mass @xmath0 according to the gravitational gauss law .",
    "we see clearly from ( [ e_rn_h ] ) and ( [ e_kerr_h ] ) that when applying the entropic force idea to the black hole horizon , it is the reduced mass @xmath1 that takes the place of the black hole mass @xmath0 . for the schwarzschild black hole",
