    "the development of short and intense laser pulses has opened the possibility to control and observe electronic and nuclear motion on the attosecond time scale  @xcite .",
    "the new light sources are key to probe and manipulate the electronic structure and dynamics in many - electron atoms  @xcite and molecules  @xcite . for instance , few photon ionization using short pulses results in ejected electrons whose spatial distribution depends on the energy spectrum and angular momentum of the initial state as well as the ionic channels involved  @xcite .",
    "likewise it has become clear that accurate modelling of time - delays in photoionization require careful consideration of electron - correlation effects ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and the recent review ref .",
    "accordingly , there is a range of processes that require explicit time - dependent methods capable of treating electron correlations beyond mean - field and single - active electron approximations . in the case of he",
    ", it is possible to solve numerically the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for larger systems , and for photon energies that only affect the valence shell , one can consider two electrons immersed in the mean - field potential produced by the inner electrons  @xcite .",
    "in general , however , in order to consider more than two electrons in an atom and to make the tdse tractable it is mandatory to use approximations to the wave function and hence the tdse . to this end ,",
    "the time - dependent configuration - interaction ( td - ci ) method consists of expanding the many - electron wave function as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the full ci hilbert space of all accessible configurations .",
    "it is the finite size of @xmath1 that introduces approximations . in eq .",
    ", @xmath2 is the time - dependent coefficient of the configuration @xmath3 , formed by a set of spin - orbitals . in this formalism",
    ", the tdse corresponds to a set of first - order differential equations for @xmath2 .",
    "the description of the continuum , however , demands a large number of orbitals and configurations , which makes the ci approach numerically intractable with increasing number of electrons . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "there are several methods such as the time - dependent configuration - interaction singles ( td - cis )  @xcite , the time - dependent restricted - active - space configuration - interaction ( td - ras - ci )  @xcite and the time - dependent generalized - active - space configuration - interaction ( td - gas - ci ) method  @xcite which impose restrictions on the allowed excitations and the active orbital spaces .",
    "these approximations still require many configurations in addition to a careful design of the partitions in the active space .",
    "it is also very challenging to extend those methodologies to situations with more than a single electron in the continuum , as is also the case with the @xmath4-matrix method  @xcite although some progress has been reported in that direction  @xcite . despite the difficulties , it is nevertheless attractive to explore a wave function approach , because of , e.g. , the unambiguous extraction of observables . the theory should ideally reduce as much as possible the number of orbitals needed for an accurate description of the configuration space . a breakthrough along those lines came with the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method  @xcite and the mctdh - fock ( mctdhf ) method ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where time - dependent spin - orbitals are introduced in the ansatz , making @xmath5 time - dependent @xmath6 the main advantage of this method is that the use of time - dependent spin - orbitals makes it possible to describe the wave function and , in particular , the continuum with a smaller number of orbitals and configurations than with the time - independent orbitals used in the ci approach corresponding to eq .  . the mctdhf method has , e.g. , been applied to describe high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) in low dimensions  @xcite , polarization of the continuum  @xcite and to calculate cross sections of atomic  @xcite and molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "since the spatial orbitals are time - dependent , the one- and two - body operators must be updated at each time step , leading to a high numerical cost , especially in the 3d case . moreover , as in the ci picture , the use of many orbitals may still imply an intractable number of accessible configurations .",
    "there are several strategies to diminish the numerical effort without loss of accuracy , such as the time - dependent occupation - restricted multiple - active - space ( td - ormas )  @xcite , the time - dependent complete - active - space self - consistent - field ( td - casscf )  @xcite and the time - dependent restricted - active - space self - consistent - field ( td - rasscf )  @xcite methods .",
    "in particular , the td - rasscf method benefits from the ras to diminish the accessible configurations and hence allows the consideration of only a subset @xmath7 of the configurations in @xmath8 by dividing the active space into two or more parts . among these parts",
    "electron excitations take place with certain restrictions  @xcite , specified at will , and most often chosen by physical insight into the problem at hand .    in the present work",
    "we apply the td - rasscf method with double excitations ( td - rasscf - d ) to address the role of electron correlation in be in the ground state , in photoionization spectra induced by short xuv pulses and in time - delay studies .",
    "the td - rasscf - d method was previously shown to be accurate and computationally efficient in 1d cases  @xcite , and the td - rasscf theory was recently extended with a space partitioning concept  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the approach resides in the possibility of selecting an appropriate ras which captures the most important configurations for a given system and physical process . for a very recent discussion of these aspects in the case of cold atomic bosons",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . the flexibility in choosing the ras is remarkable in the imaginary time propagation ( itp ) , where we show that the active space concept facilitates the convergence .",
    "by identifying the most important active orbitals , the td - rasscf - d method can be as accurate as the mctdhf method , but with a smaller number of configurations highlighting the important role of double excitations for the ground state .",
    "the application of this method to 3d systems is , however , still computationally challenging due to the large number of non - zero matrix elements of the two - body operator . to overcome this issue",
    ", we develop and use the _ coupled basis _ method to diminish the number of operations required to evaluate the two - body operator .",
    "in addition to the itp studies for the ground state , we present studies of be subject to short linearly polarized xuv laser pulses . in general",
    "the photoelectron energy spectra ( pes ) reveal detailed properties of atomic , molecular or solid targets , including energies , structural and symmetrical properties of the states of the system .",
    "for instance , the directional distribution of the ejected electrons depends on the angular momentum of the final and initial states and the number of absorbed photons  @xcite . as for the ground state studies ,",
    "the present td - rasscf - d method allows the identification of the most important active orbitals for an accurate description of the photoelectron spectra . furthermore , the electronic dynamics of the remaining ion during the photoionization has an impact on the outgoing electrons , enclosed , in particular , in the apparent time of ionization  @xcite .",
    "the experimental and theoretical computation of this quantity is very sensitive to the method , and constitutes a fundamental probe of the many - body dynamics  @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the relative time - delay in ionization between the channel ( i ) be[@xmath9)@xmath10s@xmath11 @xmath12 [ be@xmath13(@xmath14 ) + @xmath15 ] @xmath10p@xmath16 , and the channel ( ii ) be[@xmath9)@xmath10s@xmath11 @xmath12 [ be@xmath13(@xmath17 ) + @xmath18 ] @xmath10p@xmath16 with @xmath19 .",
    "as is evident from dipole selection rules , process ( i ) is possible without electron - electron correlation , while in process ( ii ) ionization is accompanied by a shakeup in the ion and requires electron - electron correlation .",
    "the study shows that an accurate description of time - delays in be requires a treatment beyond the mean - field time - dependent hartree - fock theory , and identifies the ras scheme that provides an accurate value for the delay .",

    "we consider an @xmath20 electron atom with a nuclear charge @xmath21 interacting with a linearly polarized laser pulse of short duration .",
    "we take the spin - restricted ansatz of the many - electron wave function as @xmath22 with the configurations @xmath23 constructed from @xmath24 spatial orbitals which can each hold a spin up and a spin down electron , i.e. , @xmath25 time - dependent spin - orbitals , @xmath26 , which form an orthonormal basis in the @xmath27 space , with the @xmath28 space being the rest of the single - particle hilbert space in fig .",

    "the formalism also allows for a core with always occupied time - dependent orbitals corresponding to a @xmath35 space  @xcite . in this work",

    "in contrast , in the td - rasscf approach we divide the active space in @xmath29 and @xmath32 , which contain @xmath30 and @xmath33 spatial orbitals , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . the ras concept can be extended by a @xmath35 space describing a core where the time - dependent orbitals are always occupied . in this paper",
    "we consider td - rasscf - d without a core , that is , we allow double - electron excitations from @xmath29 to @xmath32 .",
    "the td - rasscf - d method is numerically efficient and accurately accounts for the two - body interactions .",
    "these properties are related to brillouin s theorem , which establishes that a single excitation in a self - consistent method does not improve the hf solution  @xcite . also note that configurations with double excitations with time - dependent orbitals include non - vanishing projections on the singles space spanned by time - independent orbitals .",
    "to apply the td - rasscf - d method , it is convenient to write the hamiltonian in second quantization @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fermionic annihilation and creation operators of an electron in the time - dependent spin - orbital @xmath39 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath40 for all the orbitals and @xmath41 for the orbitals in @xmath27 space , where we specify by single ( @xmath42 ) or double prime ( @xmath43 ) that they belong to different partitions if necessary . in eq .",

    "( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the one hand ,",
    "let us consider the case of mctdhf , that is , if we take into account all the combinations of the orbitals to construct the slater determinants , then eq .   becomes an identity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case we only need to solve eqs .   and  , and we can set @xmath65 to be any antihermitian matrix  @xcite and in practice often @xmath66 is used . on the other hand , for the td - rasscf - d method including only double excitations  @xcite , the constraints on the active space imply that we only have the freedom to choose a fixed value for @xmath67 if both the orbitals @xmath68 and @xmath69 belong to either @xmath29 or @xmath32 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 belonging to different partitions implies solving eq .  , together with eqs .   and  .",
    "the main advantage of the td - rasscf - d method compared with mctdhf is that it is possible to include only the relevant configurations for a given physical observable or process .",
    "the numerical effort is therefore smaller for the same number of orbitals  @xcite , a point we will discuss further below .",
    "this method shares with the mctdhf the numerical instability in the @xmath28 space equation induced by the singularity of the inverse of the reduced one - body density matrix , @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , a system with low entanglement would require only a small number of orbitals , and the addition of more leads to small eigenvalues of the one - body density matrix  @xcite . to address this problem , the one - body density matrix is usually regularized @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a regularization parameter  @xcite . in this work we set @xmath76 .",
    "here we discuss the single - orbital basis and for completeness we collect the formulas needed for its construction .",
    "to describe the orbitals of the many - electron wave function , we use a basis set expansion in a finite element discrete variable representation ( fe - dvr ) for the radial grid  @xcite and spherical harmonics for the angular part ,  i.e. , @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the coefficients of the expansion , @xmath79 are the fe - dvr functions and @xmath80 are the spherical harmonics . to define the fe - dvr functions we divide the radial grid @xmath81 $ ] in @xmath82 finite elements with @xmath83 nodes in each element .",

    "the matrix elements of the two - body operator need to be updated at each time step and this update is the main bottleneck of time - dependent scf methods .",
    "the two - body electron - electron interaction reads in the multipole expansion @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is the largest ( smallest ) between @xmath97 .",
    "the electron - electron coulomb repulsion is not diagonal in the angular coordinates , because , in the evaluation of the matrix elements , each spherical harmonic in eq .",
    "couples with two angular functions coming from the product of two orbitals .",
    "this leads to numerous non - vanishing matrix elements which require both large memory for storage and long cpu time for updating the orbitals .",
    "there are several proposals to overcome these issues . on the one hand",
    ", we can reduce the number of applications of the two - body operator using the constant mean - field approximation  @xcite or by restricting the number of operations by allowing only a small number of @xmath98 in the single - orbital expansion  @xcite , or both . on the other hand",
    ", we can make the two - body operator sparse by expanding it in a pseudo - dvr basis  @xcite for the angular grid .",
    "in this work , we apply what we call the _ coupled basis _ method .",
    "we use that the electron - electron interaction commutes with the total angular momentum and its projection on the @xmath99 axis for two electrons ,  i.e. , @xmath100=\\left[(l_{z,1}+l_{z,2}),1/|\\vec{r_1}-\\vec{r_2}|\\right]=0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath101 conserves the coupled @xmath102 in a basis of two - orbital functions in the coupled representation . at each time step",
    ", we therefore transform the product of two orbitals into a two - orbital function in the coupled representation @xmath103 where we used the fe - dvr property that @xmath104 , and where we defined @xmath105 with @xmath106 the gaunt coefficients @xmath107 from eq .",
    "we now see that the two - body matrix elements in the coupled basis form a block diagonal matrix in @xmath108 . using this property , the mean - field operator in eq",
    ".   reads as @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite eq .   in the fe - dvr basis . after some algebra",
    "we find @xmath111 with @xmath112 where @xmath113 is approximated by  @xcite @xmath114^{-1}+\\cfrac{r_\\alpha^l r_\\gamma^l}{r_\\text{max}^{2l+1}}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is twice the kinetic energy matrix .",
    "now , we can obtain the terms needed to solve eqs .   and  , such as the application of the mean - field operator on a single spatial orbital @xmath116",
    "similarly we obtain for the two - body operator @xmath117 to highlight the benefits from using the coupled basis method , we compute the number of operations performed at each update . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath118 and take into account all possible combinations of spherical harmonics , even if the associated clebsch - gordan coefficient is zero . first , the number of operations required for the transformation to the coupled basis is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the number of radial functions , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the numbers of angular functions in the single - orbital and coupled basis , respectively .",
    "second , the evaluation of the mean - field operator needs @xmath123 operations , and the cost of its application to each orbital requires @xmath124 operations .",
    "finally , the calculation of the matrix element of the two - body operator requires @xmath125 operations .",
    "the most important achievement of this method is that the number of operations of the mean - field operator scales linearly with the number of angular functions , contrary to the numerical effort required if we use directly the product basis , where the scaling goes as @xmath126 .      to describe the electronic structure",
    "accurately we require a dense grid in the radial coordinate around the nucleus , which in momentum space implies highly oscillating functions with large momenta .",
    "these functions introduce rapid oscillations in time which require a very small time step to be resolved and this stiffness leads to instabilities in eqs .  -  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "however , these high - energy states do not contribute to the dynamics of interests and they can therefore be removed by a suitable projection .",
    "the calculation of the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian is not possible in the present framework , and even worse , in the presence of the laser , the hamiltonian would have to be diagonalized at each time step .",
    "for these reasons , we consider only the high energy states of the one - body hamiltonian , which is often a good approximation  @xcite . taking this consideration into account",
    ", we apply the energy subspace projection described in refs .",
    "first , we diagonalize the field - free one - body hamiltonian to obtain the high - energy one - body states @xmath127 .",
    "second , we define the projector @xmath128 to remove the contributions with eigenenergies @xmath129 from the time - dependent many - body hamiltonian , @xmath130 , obtaining the stiffness - free hamiltonian @xmath131 .",
    "the many - body nature of the problem makes it difficult to apply @xmath132 on the hamiltonian , therefore , we perform the projection on the wave function @xmath133 , which consists on projection out the high energy contribution from each orbital . the energy cutoff is set between 350 - 1500 a.u ..      in this section we describe a procedure to obtain the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "often used methods consists of projecting on scattering waves , coulomb waves or plane waves  @xcite .",
    "while the projection on scattering states can be applied immediately after the end of the pulse , the projection on coulomb or plane waves requires the propagation over some periods after the laser is switched off to allow the ejected electron to arrive at the outer region , where the interaction of the outgoing electron with the atom can either be neglected or approximated by the coulombic monopole term . in this work",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we integrate the one - body density over @xmath134 electrons and second , we project on coulomb or plane waves in the outer region , as specified below , in the remaining coordinate .",

    "this strategy , however , turns out to be problematic for many ras partitions , including the mctdhf case , due to the many local minima of the energy located in the manifold  @xcite .",
    "then a more careful consideration of the design of the initial guess wave function becomes mandatory in order to reach a good approximation , ideally the global minimum , for the ground state  @xcite .",
    "one of the great advantages of the td - rasscf method is that we can choose the partition in the active space which induces the most important slater determinants for a given physical process . in the 3d case",

    "<S> we apply a three - dimensional ( 3d ) implementation of the time - dependent restricted - active - space self - consistent - field ( td - rasscf ) method to investigate effects of electron correlation in the ground state of be as well as in its photoionization dynamics by short xuv pulses , including time - delay in photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> first , we obtain the ground state by propagation in imaginary time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the flexibility of the td - rasscf on the choice of the active orbital space makes it possible to consider only relevant active space orbitals , facilitating the convergence to the ground state compared to the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree - fock method , used as a benchmark to show the accuracy and efficiency of td - rasscf . </S>",
    "<S> second , we solve the equations of motion to compute photoelectron spectra of be after interacting with a short linearly polarized xuv laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the spectra for different ras schemes , and in this way we identify the orbital spaces that are relevant for an accurate description of the photoelectron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the effects of electron correlation on the magnitude of the relative time - delay in the photoionization process into two different ionic channels . </S>",
    "<S> one channel , the ground state channel in the ion , is accessible without electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the other channel is only accessible when including electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the time - delay is highly sensitivity to the choice of the active space , and hence to the account of electron - electron correlation . </S>"
