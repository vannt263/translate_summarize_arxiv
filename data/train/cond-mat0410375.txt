    "the abo@xmath1 perovskite structure exhibits several lattice instabilities which lead to a rich variety of phase diagrams with structures ranging from non - polar antiferrodistortive ( afd ) to ferroelectric ( fe ) and antiferroelectric ( afe ) . in these systems ,",
    "polar and non - polar instabilities often compete and tend to suppress one another . for instance , in srtio@xmath1 it has been found that ferroelectricity is enhanced if the afd degrees of freedom are artificially frozen out by setting the corresponding distortion to zero.@xcite of these various instabilities , the polar instabilities are the ones responsible for the technologically important and fundamentally interesting properties , such as ferroelectricity and large piezoelectric and dielectric responses .    currently there is a great deal of effort being expended to develop nanoscale devices",
    ". if nanoscale systems based on ferroelectricity are to be feasible , then the polar instabilities must remain dominant down to the nanoscale . in systems of reduced dimensionality , such as thin films or nanoparticles , a substantial fraction of the material is found in proximity to a surface , and surface effects may become important .",
    "the surface can affect the material behavior by modifying the strength of the various instabilities and their interactions leading to novel phases not present in bulk systems .",
    "lead titanate ( pbtio@xmath1 ) is the prototype of a large class of pb - based perovskites .",
    "the cubic perovskite structure of pbtio@xmath1 possesses several branches of unstable phonons , including fe instabilities which consist of zone - center polar to modes and afd instabilities which consist of nonpolar zone - boundary modes involving rotations of oxygen octahedral cages surrounding the ti atoms .",
    "@xcite in bulk pbtio@xmath1 , the fe and afd instabilities of the cubic structure compete with each other and the fe lattice distortion suppresses the afd distortion so that afd distortions do not participate in the ground - state tetragonal fe structure .",
    "the possible impact of the proximity of the surface on lattice instabilities and their mutual interactions is thus of great importance in understanding the structure and properties of pbtio@xmath1 surfaces and ultrathin films .",
    "previous theoretical studies on lead titanate have been confined to the behavior of the polar fe instability at the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "@xcite these studies employed ( 1@xmath01 ) surface periodicity , which by construction does not permit afd deformations .",
    "proximity to the surface , however , could enhance the strength of non - polar instabilities and modify their interaction with the fe instability .",
    "indeed , an afd c(2@xmath02 ) reconstruction has recently been found at the ( 001 ) surface of pbtio@xmath1 using grazing incidence x - ray scattering,@xcite suggesting that the afd instability is important at the surface .    in the following ,",
    "we study the behavior of the afd instability and its possible competition with ferroelectricity at the pbtio@xmath1 ( 001 ) surface using first - principles calculations .",
    "initially we study the afd distortion at the surface , using symmetry constraints to freeze out polar distortions ; next we relax this constraint and study the competition between the afd and in - plane fe distortions at the pbo - terminated surface , which is the equilibrium termination for pbtio@xmath1 ( 001)@xcite .    in the absence of ferroelectricity",
    ", we find that the impact of the surface is termination - dependent : at the pbo - terminated surface , the strength of the afd instability is enhanced relative to the bulk ; while at the tio@xmath2 terminated surface , the strength of the instability is diminished . at the pbo - surface ,",
    "in contrast to the bulk , where the presence of ferroelectricity suppresses afd , we find that the two coexist and we observe a c(2@xmath02 ) reconstruction that agrees very well with experiment.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : theory ] is devoted to the theoretical method and the technical details of our calculations . in section  [ sec : afdbulk ]",

    "this is achieved by using a symmetric c(2@xmath02 ) slab with space group pm.@xcite the mirror symmetry , m@xmath11 , prevents spontaneous polarization in the @xmath9 direction and allows only an in - plane polarization to develop in the film .",
    "the case of perpendicular polarization is not considered in this work because it requires special treatment of the electrical boundary conditions and a separate discussion.@xcite    the atomic structure was optimized by relaxing the symmetry - allowed atomic displacements .",
    "we defined atomic displacements , @xmath12 , relative to the ideal perovskite structure .",
    "atomic relaxations normal to the surface , @xmath13 , cause a rumpling of the atomic layers and a change in interlayer distances relative to the ideal cubic structure .",
    "the in - plane atomic relaxations , @xmath14 , chiefly consist of rotations of the oxygen squares surrounding the ti atoms in the tio@xmath2 planes .    to analyze the optimized structures and compare with previous results we computed the following parameters : the rumpling amplitude , @xmath15 , in each layer , @xmath16 , the change in the interlayer distances relative to the ideal cubic structure , @xmath17 , and the rotation angle of the oxygen squares in the tio@xmath2 planes , @xmath18 .",

    "a negative rumpling , @xmath26 , means that on average the metal atoms are deeper inside the surface relative to the o atoms .",

    "to understand how the afd instability is modified near the surface we first study the afd distortion in bulk pbtio@xmath1 .",
    "the rotation of oxygen octahedra is a common afd instability in perovskite oxides . in bulk",
    "cubic pbtio@xmath1 it is associated with two unstable zone - boundary phonons : the r@xmath27 mode at the r point of the brillouin zone , * q*=(111)@xmath28 , and the m@xmath1 mode at the m point , * q*=(110)@xmath28 . the three - fold degenerate r@xmath27 mode can be chosen to correspond to the rotations , about the @xmath29 cartesian axes , of tio@xmath30 octahedra in opposite directions from one cubic unit cell to the next .",
    "the singly - degenerate m@xmath1 mode is similar to the r@xmath27 mode , but neighboring planes of octahedra along the rotation axis rotate in - phase instead of out - of - phase .",
    "we considered distorted structures obtained by separately  freezing in \" r@xmath27 and m@xmath1 modes in cubic pbtio@xmath1 at the theoretical cubic lattice constant ( @xmath8=7.37 a.u . ) . in fig .",
    "[ bulk_r25_fig ] we show the computed values of the total energy per 5-atom unit cell as a function of the rotation angle . the energy is lowered by the afd distortion , as expected , and the r@xmath27 distortion with rotation along a cartesian axis is more favorable than the related m@xmath1 distortion .",
    "the computed equilibrium value of the octahedral rotation angle is @xmath31 , and the energy gain associated with the afd instability in the bulk is @xmath32 = 1.2 mev per bulk unit cell ( well depth in fig .  [ bulk_r25_fig ] ) .",
    "the small energy gain indicates that cubic pbtio@xmath1 , in the absence of any fe distortion , displays only a weak afd instability .",
    "in particular , it is much weaker than the ferroelectric instability , which has a well depth of about 15 mev for the cubic undistorted unit cell ( and about 50 mev per unit cell if coupling with the tetragonal distortion is included ) .",
    "the afd instability is suppressed by the fe distortion .",
    "in fact the ground - state ferroelectric tetragonal structure with 5 atoms per unit cell has no unstable phonons at any wavevector@xcite .",
    "the ferroelectric structure results from the coupling of a fe polar distortion ( to mode ) and a tetragonal strain .",
    "we checked , therefore , if the suppression of the afd instability can be caused by the fe distortion alone . to do this",
    "we first relaxed the ferroelectric distortion without coupling to tetragonal strain by keeping the unit cell fixed to the ideal cubic structure and allowing internal atomic displacements along the ( 001 ) direction . as a result a spontaneous polarization develops along the ( 001 ) direction .",
    "we then computed the phonons for this `` cubic polarized '' structure ( c - fe ) and found no unstable modes at the r point of the brillouin zone .",
    "we conclude that the fe distortion suppresses the afd instability even in absence of tetragonal strain .",
    "to understand the behavior of non - polar distortions near the surface , we study the atomic structure of the non - polar ( paraelectric ) films . we studied both the pbo and tio@xmath2 terminations with c(2@xmath02 ) in - plane translational symmetry .",

    "the results for the ( 1@xmath01 ) surface are in excellent agreement with a previous calculation  @xcite , given in table  [ tab : pbostructure ] .",
    "small differences are chiefly due to the different slab thickness used in the two calculations ( we obtained almost identical results using a 7-layer slab as in ref . ) .",
    "we used a thicker 11-layer slab to study the behavior of lattice distortions in the near - surface region and their decay to bulk - like behavior in the central layers of the slab .",
    "the change in interlayer distance displays an oscillating behavior : the first interlayer distance , @xmath33 , is substantially contracted , whereas the second , @xmath34 , is expanded and the third , @xmath35 , is again contracted .",
    "the most noticeable features is the large inward displacement of the surface pb atom relative to the surface o atom .",

    "this energy difference can be divided into a _ bulk _ and a _ surface _ contribution as follows : @xmath39 the bulk contribution , @xmath40 , is the energy gain associated with the bulk - like rotation of the inner `` non - surface '' octahedra , with n being the number of such bulk - like octahedra in the c(2@xmath02 ) unit cell ( n=6 for the 11 layer slab ) .",
    "the surface contribution , @xmath41 , is the energy gain associated with the rotation of the surface octahedra .",

    "[ eq : energy ] , and the computed values for the three energies : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , we find that the energy associated with the surface afd distortion at the pbo - termination is @xmath45= 109 mev per ( 1@xmath01 ) surface unit cell .    by comparing this result with the afd and fe well depths in the bulk ( 1.2 mev and 50 mev , respectively ) we find that the energy gain associated with the surface afd rotation is two orders of magnitude larger at the pbo - terminated surface than in the bulk , and about twice the bulk ferroelectric well depth .",
    "in this section we present our results for the c(2@xmath02 ) pbtio@xmath1 ( 001 ) film with spontaneous polarization parallel to the surface , * p*=p(100 ) . in particular we are interested in studying the interaction between afd and in - plane fe distortions in proximity of the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "we consider only the pbo termination , which is the most energetically favorable and , as we have shown in the previous section , displays a strong surface afd instability in absence of fe distortions .",

    "thus , contrary to the bulk where fe distortions suppress the afd rotation , fe and afd distortions coexist at the pbo surface .",
    "we now consider these coupled distortions in more detail , using a symmetry analysis .",
    "the c(2@xmath02 ) supercell can accommodate atomic distortions of the ( 1@xmath01 ) ideal unit cell with wavevectors * q*=(000 ) and * q*=(110)@xmath28 ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 point of the ( 1@xmath01 ) surface bz , respectively ) . thus , the atomic displacements relative to the ideal perovskite structure can be decomposed into @xmath47- and @xmath48-point irreducible representations of the reference ( 1@xmath01 ) unit cell : @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 labels the irreducible representations , @xmath16 the atoms in the c(2@xmath02 ) unit cell , and @xmath51=@xmath52 ) .",

    "the computed values for the parameters describing the strength of fe , afe , and afd distortions in each atomic layer are summarized in table  [ tab : inplane ] .",
    "the fe distortion is enhanced at the surface and rapidly resumes the bulk value in the inner layers .",
