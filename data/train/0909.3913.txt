    "stellar clusters are ideal for research being groups of stars born simultaneously , under the same physical conditions , situated at the same distance , but with a wide range of stellar masses . altogether stellar clusters are excellent probes for the study of the structure , and dynamical and chemical evolutions of the galaxy , since their interstellar reddenings , chemical abundances , distances , and ages can be determined with precision using various colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagrams from the @xmath0 photometry , as well as stellar models and isochrones . in effect , the younger open stellar clusters have been utilized as tracers of spiral structure of the galaxy ( e.g.  becker & fenkart 1970 , moffat & vogt 1973 , feinstein 1994 ) , as tracers of galactic three - dimensional structure ( e.g.  cabrera - cao et al .  1990 , phelps & janes 1994 , moitinho 2002 ) , and in the analysis of the structure and chemical evolution of the galactic disc ( e.g.  janes 1979 , friel 1995 , piatti et al .",
    "1995 , twarog et al .  1997 ) .",
    "individually , stellar clusters can be used to constrain and test the theories of stellar formation and evolution . the detailed comparison between photometric diagrams and theoretical isochrones , calculated from models of stellar evolution ,",
    "has led to enormous advances in the understanding of stellar structure and evolution , and is still providing very useful information concerning the effects of convective overshooting , chemical compositions , gravitational settling , and radiative accelerations ( meynet et al . 1993 , kassis et al .",
    "1997 , michaud et al .",
    "these photometric diagrams are also useful in searching for interesting and peculiar stars , such as be stars , blue stragglers , recently formed stars , and the brightest red giants ( mermilloid 1982a , b ; mermilloid & mayor 1989 ; chavarra - k 1994 ; moitinho et al .",
    "+ in these galactic studies , one of the more severe observational limitations is due to the absence of photometric data for nearly half of the approximately 1500 open clusters known , combined with the lack of homogeneity in the observations and analyses for those clusters which have been studied .",
    "these limitations form the crux of various controversies , such as : ( 1 ) whether or not there is a metallicity gradient as a function of the galactocentric radius ( janes 1979 , twarog et al .",
    "1997 , carraro et al .",
    "1998 ) , ( 2 ) whether or not there is a vertical metallicity gradient with respect to the galactic disc ( piatti et al .  1995 ) , and ( 3 ) uncertainties in the characteristics of the galactic structure , for example the spiral structure ( i.e.  the number and positions of the various arms ) .",
    "+ the catalogue of lyng ( 1987 ) , which includes distances for 422 open clusters , has constituted the observational basis for a large number of astronomical studies , has led to important conclusions about the galactic disc , and has been very useful for planning subsequent observations by other astronomers . however , this catalogue has been built from parameters obtained by various authors , with diverse observing techniques , distinct calibrations , and different criteria for determining the stellar ages , rendering it very inhomogeneous and limited for studies requiring precision in the measurement of these fundamental parameters .",
    "as an example of the precision and accuracy that one can expect due to the effects of these inhomogeneities , we refer to janes & adler ( 1982 ) , who found that distance moduli obtained by two or more authors have a mean difference of @xmath22 mag ( see also webda : http://www.univie.ac.at/webda/navigation.html ) .",
    "+ to remedy these inaccuracies , a project ( ` a @xmath0 survey for open clusters of the northern hemisphere ' ) has been developed whose principal objective is to obtain and to analyze in a systematic way a set of ccd data , taken with the @xmath0 photometric system , for the more than 300 open clusters visible from the national astronomical observatory , san pedro mrtir ( spm ) , most of which have been previously unstudied ( schuster et al .  2007 ;",
    "michel et al .  in preparation ) . with this photometry , which is homogeneous regarding instrumentation , observing techniques , reduction methods , and analysis",
    ", the following will be obtained : ( a ) a uniform , photometric reference system via open clusters to which other photometric studies can be transformed , ( b ) an atlas of colour - colour ( cc ) and colour - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams for galactic open clusters with distinct fundamental parameters , ( c ) a homogeneous data set of interstellar reddenings , metallicities , distances , and ages for a large set of galactic open clusters , ( d ) an increased number of old and distant open clusters . (",
    "e ) selection criteria lists for subsequent spectroscopic and deeper photometric studies of open clusters .",
    "the open clusters for our ` quick ' survey have been selected from the large ( and mostly complete ) catalogue of dias et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , ` optically visible open clusters and candidates ' , which is now also available and updated through 2007 at the cds ( centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ) as catalogue vii/229 ( or b / ocl ) .",
    "our subset of clusters are those observable from spm ( latitude @xmath23 ) and which have little or no previous studies , such as be  15 and be  80 of this paper ; a few others which have been analyzed earlier have also been added for comparison purposes , such as ngc  2192 ( tapia - peralta 2007 ) . more details concerning the selection of clusters and the project motivation will be presented in the principal , introductory publication of this survey ( michel et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the three open clusters of this paper , be  15 , be  80 , and ngc  2192 represent a small , carefully selected sample used to test and to define the analysis procedures of this ` quick ' survey ; these clusters have been well observed , provide probable turn - offs in the g- , b- , and f - type stars , respectively , and include small to moderately large interstellar reddenings .",
    "a ccd @xmath0 survey of northern open clusters has been undertaken at spm using always the same instrumental setup ( telescope , ccd , filters ) , observing procedures , reduction methods , and system of standard stars ( landolt 1983 , 1992 ) .",
    "the ccd @xmath0 observations of this paper have been made exclusively with the 0.84-m f/13 cassegrain telescope at spm , during the night of 2001 june 25/26 for the open cluster be 80 , and the nights 2002 february 6/7 and 8/9 for the clusters",
    "ngc 2192 and be 15 , respectively .",
    "the telescope hosted the filter - wheel ` mexman ' with the site  1 ( si003 ) ccd camera , which has a 1024@xmath241024 square pixel array , with a pixel size of @xmath25m@xmath26 m ; this ccd has non - linearities less than 0.45 per cent over a wide range , no evidence for fringing even in the @xmath10 band , and metachrome ii and visar coverings to increase sensitivity at the blue and near - ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "this telescope was re - focused before the observation of each open cluster , usually using the @xmath3 filter of our parfocal set of @xmath0 filters .",
    "the open clusters have been observed with exposure times of @xmath27 seconds for the @xmath28 filter , @xmath29 for @xmath9 , @xmath30 for @xmath3 , @xmath30 for @xmath11 , and @xmath31 for @xmath10 ; for be  15 and ngc  2192 extra exposures in the filter @xmath28 were made to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "also , for be  80 exposures as short as 10 seconds have been made in the @xmath11 and @xmath10 filters to de - saturate the brightest stars of the field , and as short as 25 seconds to de - saturate the brightest stars of be  15 and ngc  2192 .    each night several standard - star fields from landolt ( 1992 )",
    "were observed to permit the derivation of the photometric transformations to the system of johnson - cousins and the coefficients of the atmospheric extinction . for the june 2001 observing run , six landolt groups were used , containing 23 different standard stars : pg1633 + 099 ( 5 stars ) , mark  a ( 4 stars ) , pg1528 + 062 ( 3 stars ) , pg1530 + 057 ( 3 stars ) , pg1525 - 071 ( 4 stars ) , and pg1657 + 078 ( 4 stars ) , with a range in @xmath32@xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , in @xmath1@xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , and in @xmath39@xmath40 from @xmath41 to @xmath38 .",
    "thirteen to 25 observations of these landolt standards were made per night .",
    "for the february 2002 run eight landolt groups were employed , containing 35 different standard stars : pg1047 + 003 ( 4 stars ) , pg1323 - 086 ( 5 stars ) , sa95 ( 5 stars ) , sa107 ( 4 stars ) , pg0942 - 029 ( 5 stars ) , sa104 ( 4 stars ) , pg0918 + 029 ( 5 stars ) , and pg1528 + 062 ( 3 stars ) , with a range in @xmath32@xmath33 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , in @xmath1@xmath36 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , and in @xmath39@xmath40 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "fifty - two to 72 observations of these landolt standards were made per night , except one night cut short by clouds , when only 15 observations were managed .",
    "the standard - star fields have been observed with exposures of @xmath48 seconds for the @xmath28 filter , @xmath49 for b , @xmath50 for v , @xmath50 for r , and @xmath50 for i.    usually one , or more , landolt fields were re - observed with an air - mass range of at least 0.70 in order to measure the coefficients of the atmospheric extinction .",
    "for example , the night when be  80 was observed , an approximate air - mass range of 1.29 was achieved , and a range of 1.26 for ngc  2192 . due to the wide band - passes of these johnson - cousins filters",
    ", second - order colour terms were included in these atmospheric - extinction corrections .",
    "for the large air - mass observations required for an atmospheric - extinction determination , the filters were frequently observed with both forward and backward sequences ( i.e.  @xmath51 ) ; this was occasionally done also for other standard - star fields to increase the accuracy , precision , and observing efficiency of the photometric observations .",
    "the usual calibration procedures for ccd photometry have been carried out during each of our observing runs .",
    "fifty to a hundred ` bias ' exposures have been made each night , and fifty or more ` darks ' during each run with exposures of 415 minutes , according to the longest of our stellar exposures ; these ` darks ' were usually made during the non - photometric nights .",
    "flat fields were obtained at the beginning and end of the nights by observing a clear patch of sky ; at least 5 flat fields were obtained for each filter per night with exposures greater than 5 seconds , and with small offsets on the sky between each flat - field exposure .",
    "the data reductions of this ccd photometry have been carried out using the usual techniques and packages of iraf .",
    "aperature photometry and psf photometry have been used for handling the standard - star and cluster - star observations , respectively ( howell 1989 , 1990 ; stetson 1987 , 1990 ) .",
    "more details concerning the instrumentation and the observing and reduction procedures of this project will be given in an introductory paper ( michel et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "for the analyses of these open clusters , an awk macro , ` elipse ' , has been developed which allows us to concentrate on the centre of a cluster , as defined by visual inspection in a visual ( @xmath3 ) or red ( @xmath11 ) image , helping to increase the contrast of the cluster with respect to the surrounding fields in the various colour - colour ( cc ) and colour - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams .",
    "this macro defines an elliptical area on the image , and when applied to the ccd data file , retains all stars within this elliptical area for further analyses and excludes all stars outside this area .",
    "the input parameters of this macro are the centre of the ellipse ( x , y coordinates in pixels ) , the major and minor axes of the ellipse in pixels , and an angle of rotation in degrees .",
    "this macro has been used interactively by selecting the input parameters , then plotting the resulting elliptical field , and finally iterating to a more concentrated central region as seen in the visual or red image .",
    "this ellipse has been fit as tightly as possible to each cluster while still including all obvious visible members .",
    "this process is somewhat subjective , and has been applied prior to the plotting of any cc or cm diagrams .    a java - based computer program ( ` safe ' by j.  mcfarland , 2009 ) has also been utilized for the visualization and analysis of the photometric data of these open clusters ( schuster et al .",
    "this system is capable of displaying each cluster s data simultaneously in different cc and cm diagrams and has an interactive way to identify a star , or group of stars , in one diagram and to see were it falls in the other diagrams , thus facilitating the elimination of field stars and the apperception of cluster features .",
    "this program is capable of displaying up to 16 different diagrams for one cluster while processing up to 20 clusters at the same time .",
    "x and y positions ( in pixels ) , and standard @xmath52 ccd photometry and observing errors for the open clusters be  15 , be  80 and ngc  2192 are presented in tables  13 , respectively .    [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      1 .",
    "our best values for the interstellar reddening , distance modulus , and @xmath53 for be  15 are @xmath4@xmath5 mag , @xmath39@xmath54 mag , and @xmath55 mag or @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the two possible solutions for the cluster age of be  15 depend upon the membership , or no , of the three brightest stars , as seen in figs  3 and 4",
    "our results for be  15 agree well with those of sujatha et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who employ the more independent @xmath32@xmath40 vs @xmath32@xmath33 technique given by natali et al .  ( 1994 ) for determing the interstellar reddening , but do not agree well with the results of lata et al .",

    "( 1994 ) ; we have fit be  15 to the g - type , main - sequence colours of schmidt - kaler .",
    "this suggests the need for spectroscopy for the brighter stars of be  15 to determine the membership of the brightest stars using radial velocity measurements , and spectral - type classifications to know whether the brighter members are in fact g - types or b - types .",
    "3 .   our best values for the interstellar reddening , distance modulus , and @xmath53 for",

    "our value for the reddening is in good agreement with that derived from the extinction maps of neckel & klare ( 1980 ) .",
    "our * apparent * distance modulus and age agree very well with the values of carraro , the main difference between our solutions is the interstellar reddening ; they obtain @xmath4@xmath60 mag .",
    "clear evidence for variability of the interstellar extinction across the face of the open cluster be  80 has been detected .",
    "the maximum of this change occurs approximately in the north - south direction , and the reddening has a minimum with a width of about 0.72 arcmin , running approximately east - north - east to west - south - west , slightly north of the cluster s centre , and slightly skewed , @xmath61 , with respect to to the major axis of our elliptical study area .",
    "much deeper ccd @xmath0 photometry is recommended to map more thoroughly the interstellar extinction in the vicinity of be  80 and to study the structure of the interstellar , or intracluster , reddening of this interesting region .",
