    "therefore , for @xmath106 close enough to @xmath143 , the modulus @xmath146 is bounded from above by the nullity of @xmath145 , which in turn is bounded from above by the order of the zero of the alexander polynomial at 1 by lemma  b. together with proposition  d , this yields the desired result ."
