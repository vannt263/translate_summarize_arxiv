    "in ref . @xcite we have proposed a model for magnetic moments of su(3 ) octet baryons .",
    "we get an excellent fit using few parameters . in this",
    "model magnetic moments of baryons are sums of products of magnetic moments of quarks and corresponding integrated quark densities .",
    "the corrections , which take into account exchange phenomena , were also included . to determine the size of such corrections we use sum rules for magnetic moments of octet baryons ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "after subtraction of the exchange contributions we are left with a @xmath1 symmetric part of these moments , which can be expressed as independent contributions from quarks and antiquarks in considered baryon .",
    "the magnetic moment of a quark as well as its integrated magnetic density are @xmath3 dependent , whereas its product is not .",
    "other corrections coming from exchange effects of pions and gluons are incorporated in redefinition magnetic moments of quarks and their integrated densities ; hence magnetic moments of quarks are not equal to their dirac values .",
    "so , after subtracting the pion correction to nucleon magnetic moments and taking into account @xmath4 mixing , we are left with independent one particle contributions to baryon magnetic moments ( sum rules for magnetic moments are satisfied ) and we use for them high energy parametrization ( integrated parton densities ) to describe such contributions .",
    "we believe that most of all other pion exchange and gluon exchange corrections are taken into account in the high energy parametrization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for such parametrization , in the case of axial densities , one does not include explicitly pion and gluon corrections and we do the same for integrated magnetic densities . in contrary such corrections",
    "are present in models of bound quarks , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one gluon correction with gluon exchanged between different quarks can also correspond to higher twist diagrams in deep inelastic scattering .    in integrated magnetic quark densities , besides of spin contributions , we have also orbital angular momentum contributions ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall consider two models : the one in which we neglect orbital angular momentum contribution and the second with such contribution included .",
    "in the first case we have for such integrated densities    @xmath5    in the case with angular momentum the formulas are    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    taking into account exchange contributions ( as was explained in detail in [ 1 ] ) , i.e. , isovector contribution connected with charged pion exchange between different quarks ( see also franklin @xcite ) and @xmath4 mixing , the @xmath1 symmetric part of baryon octet magnetic moments can be parametrized in terms of four quantities : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . from the fit we get for these parameters @xcite @xmath12 hence , six quantities : three quark magnetic moments and three quark densities can not be determined using only four parameters given in eq . ( 4 ) .",
    "so as in [ 1 ] , we introduce two additional parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and our quantities become the functions of them .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) :    @xmath15    @xmath16    now we can express magnetic quark densities as @xmath17 \\",

    "\\delta_{l } d & = & \\frac{g}{6r}[f(\\epsilon)+1 - 3r ] \\ , , \\\\",
    "\\delta_{l } s & = & \\frac{g}{6r}[f(\\epsilon)-2 ] \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    @xmath18    one can also express magnetic moments of u , d and s quarks in terms of our parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath19}{g(3+\\epsilon ) } \\ , . \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath14 sets a scale at which we have calculated our quantities . from eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) we have that @xmath20 and quark magnetic moment ratios , e.g. , @xmath21 , do not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "the new quantity @xmath2 , which in our notation is    @xmath22    is measured in the compass experiment @xcite and one gets    @xmath23    in the case when @xmath24 this quantity is not a valence one : @xmath25 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 10 ) we can express our parameter @xmath14 as :    @xmath26    hence , the compass measurement gives the relation between introduced parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "so we will have only one unknown parameter however , the orbital angular momenta of quarks are present in the formulas .    we know that integrated axial densities , used in deep inelastic scattering analysis , differ from @xmath27 by a sign in an antiquark term :    @xmath28    from eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) and ( 13 ) we can express @xmath29 as    @xmath30    let us express the function @xmath31 in the form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34    equation ( 15 ) gives us a relation between our two basic parameters @xmath13 and @xmath33 ( which replaces parameter @xmath14 ) .",
    "the quark integrated axial densities @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be determined from @xmath38 where the values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained from neutron and hyperon @xmath0 decays @xcite and deep inelastic scattering spin experiments @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath42    we can get additional information ( although not very precise ) using the value of @xmath33 from the hermes experiment @xcite",
    ". we will take @xmath43 which was however measured not in the whole range of @xmath44 : ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "hence we can express @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a function of parameter @xmath33 using eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 15 ) , and ( 17 ) , getting    @xmath49    one sees that @xmath46 , and @xmath47 do not depend directly on orbital angular momenta . knowing the precise value of @xmath33 in the whole range ( @xmath50 ) one is able to determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 in our model .",
    "let us start with an assumption that all angular momenta of quarks are negligible ( i.e. , we put them equal to zero ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present antiquark polarizations @xmath51 for u , d and s quarks as a functions of parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that @xmath52 is connected with the value of @xmath2 measured by the compass experiment .",
    "we can also see how the values of @xmath46 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 change when we change @xmath33 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , i.e. , within 1 standard deviation off central value .",
    "when we take the number from the hermes experiment ( @xmath57 ) , we can determine polarizations of all sea antiquarks : @xmath58 the values are a little bit different from the antiquark values quoted by hermes @xcite . using eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 15 ) we can calculate the corresponding value of parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we get @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "in general we can use eq .",
    "( 15 ) to eliminate @xmath33 and express @xmath51 as a function of @xmath13 in the case when we neglect dependence on orbital angular momenta . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show such dependence , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "one can try to determine the value of parameter @xmath13 using the experimental data for radiative vector meson decays .",
    "the model which is used to determine @xmath62 is not as sophisticated as is the one for baryon magnetic moments ; we have used similar formulas as in @xcite .",
    "one does not include the contribution from orbital momenta of quarks in such a model ; however , in @xcite it was shown that such contributions may be small . performing the fit one gets @xmath63 which gives , with the help of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath64 .",
    "if we use this value of parameter @xmath13 we will get for @xmath51 @xmath65 in this case the corresponding value of parameter @xmath33 is @xmath66 .",
    "it looks as if @xmath51 calculated from the hermes value of @xmath33 and @xmath51 calculated using @xmath13 gotten from vector meson decays are not consistent .",
    "now we shall consider the model with nonzero orbital angular momenta of quarks .",
    "we will use the values of such momenta calculated numerically on the lattice . from @xcite",
    "we have @xmath67 these values are determined at @xmath68 .",
    "let us make some comments . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) angular momentum of quarks consists of angular momentum of valence quarks , sea quarks , and antiquarks . from @xcite",
    "we have only information on valence quark contribution .",
    "we neglect the rest because of lack of knowledge ; it actually means that we assume that orbital angular momenta of sea quarks and antiquarks are equal [ see eq .",
    "the existence of a small correction to this hypothesis can not be excluded .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of quarks is scale dependent @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities : first one can take into account evolution equations for angular momenta and start with initial conditions at low energies taking as is suggested by a. w. thomas values that follow from the cloudy bag model @xcite , @xcite , which take into account the relativistic motion of quarks , chiral pion cloud , and one gluon exchange corrections .",
    "second , one can take initial conditions at high energy as was done in @xcite . in our case",
    "we use high energy parameters so it is natural to use high energy initial conditions as in @xcite . from our procedure",
    "it seems that we can not go in @xmath3 scale below @xmath69 . from @xcite",
    "it follows that the angular momenta of quarks for @xmath70 are only weakly scale dependent .",
    "the angular momenta of valence quarks and @xmath2 determine the scale used in our equations .",
    "( 19 ) and eliminating @xmath33 [ using eq .",
    "( 15 ) ] we can get formulas for @xmath51 ( for u , d and s quarks ) with orbital angular momenta taken into account : @xmath71 the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath13 , calculated from eq .",
    "( 23 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "when we use the result for @xmath13 from the fit to radiative decays of vector mesons we get for @xmath46 , @xmath53 and @xmath54    @xmath72    the errors are quite big so the determination is not very conclusive . for @xmath73",
    "we get the value @xmath74 which has to be compared with @xmath75 .",
    "the agreement is reasonable despite the fact that all errors are relatively big .",
    "let us stress that we have used the value of @xmath13 calculated from the fit to experimental data on radiative vector meson decays and have taken into account orbital angular momenta of quarks from lattice calculations .",
    "if we do not want to use the information about @xmath13 from the fit to meson decays , we can use eq .",
    "( 19 ) where this parameter is eliminated and @xmath51 are functions of @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath33 for u , d , and s antiquarks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "if we knew precisely the value of @xmath33 we could predict @xmath77 , @xmath47 , and @xmath54 values . from eq .",
    "( 19 ) we see that @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not depend on orbital angular momenta of quarks ; only @xmath54 does .",
    "it means that precise determination of @xmath54 could be the additional test of the importance of orbital angular momenta of quarks .",
    "when we use the @xmath33 value obtained in the hermes experiment we will get @xmath46 and @xmath47 as in eq .",
    "( 20 ) and @xmath78",
    ". we can not expect additional experimental information about magnetic moments of quarks . in the future more precise measurements of antiquark polarizations",
    "could be a real verification of our model .",
    "we also want to give a comparison of two models , i.e. , without and with orbital angular momenta of quarks taken into account .",
    "the relation that follows from the compass measurement of @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( 15 ) , could be rewritten in the form @xmath79    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the function @xmath80 for both models with the corresponding errors .",
    "the rectangle is given by the errors ( 1 standard deviation ) of @xmath13 and @xmath33 .",
    "it seems that it is an indication in favor of including nonzero orbital angular momenta of quarks .",
    "from the compass measurement of @xmath2 we have a relation between two parameters not determined in our previous fit to magnetic moments of baryons .",
    "hence , we have only one independent parameter and it could be either @xmath13 or @xmath33 .",
    "we have discussed two possibilities : the first with inclusion of the orbital angular momenta of quarks suggested by calculations on the lattice and the second with such angular momenta neglected .",
    "we have presented in both cases the dependence of antiquark polarizations on a single independent parameter ( being @xmath13 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to  [ fig4 ] . in order to find the antiquark polarizations we can use the result for @xmath33 from the hermes experiment or the value of @xmath13 obtained from the fit to radiative",
    "vector meson decays .",
    "unfortunately the errors are big and the results are not very conclusive .      with orbital angular momenta taken into account and the value of @xmath13 taken from the fit to radiative vector",
    "meson decays , we obtain values of antiquark polarizations .",
    "such a procedure gives the prediction @xmath81 that seems to be consistent with the value @xmath75 from the hermes experiment .",
    "because it is difficult to get additional information on magnetic moments of quarks , it seems that more precise values of antiquark polarizations ( maybe from a jefferson lab experiment ) could be a real verification of our model .",
