    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity and represent disturbances of space - time propagating at the speed of light . because of their extremely small amplitudes and interaction cross - sections , gws carry information about regions of the universe that would be otherwise unobtainable through the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "once detected , gws will allow us to open a new observational window to the universe , and perform a unique test of general relativity  @xcite .    since the first pioneering experiments by joseph weber in the early sixties  @xcite , several experimental groups around the world have been attempting to detect gws .",
    "the coming on - line of next - generation gravitational wave interferometers  @xcite , however , is likely to break this sequence of experimental drawbacks and result into the first detection before the end of the current decade .",
    "contrary to ground - based detectors , which are sensitive to gravitational waves in a band from about a few tens of hz to a few kilohertz , space - based interferometers are expected to access the frequency region from a few tenths of millihertz to about a few tens of hz , where gw signals are expected to be larger in number and characterized by larger amplitudes .",
    "the most notable example of a space interferometer , which for several decades has been jointly studied in europe and in the united states of america , is the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) mission  @xcite . by relying on coherent laser beams exchanged among three remote spacecraft along the arms of their forming giant ( almost ) equilateral triangle of arm - length equal to @xmath0 km",
    ", lisa aims to detect and study cosmic gravitational waves in the @xmath1 hz band .",
    "a space - based laser interferometer detector of gravitational waves measures relative frequency changes experienced by coherent laser beams exchanged by three pairs of spacecraft . as the laser beams are received , they are made to interfere with the outgoing laser light .",
    "since the received and receiving frequencies of the laser beams can be different by tens to perhaps hundreds of mhz ( consequence of the doppler effect from the relative inter - spacecraft velocities and the intrinsic frequency differences of the lasers ) , to remove these large beat - notes present in the heterodyne measurements one relies on the use of a microwave signal generated by an onboard clock ( usually referred to as ultra - stable oscillator ( uso ) ) .",
    "the magnitude of the frequency fluctuations introduced by the uso into the heterodyne measurements depends linearly on the usos noises themselves and the heterodyne beat - note frequencies determined by the inter - spacecraft relative velocities .",
    "space - qualified , state of the art clocks are oven - stabilized crystals characterized by an allan deviation of @xmath2 for averaging times of @xmath3 s , covering most of the frequency band of interest to space - based interferometers  @xcite . in the case of the lisa mission , in particular ,",
    "it was estimated  @xcite that the magnitude of the power spectral density of the uso s relative frequency fluctuations appearing , for instance , in the unequal - arm michelson time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) combination @xmath4 would be about six orders of magnitude larger than those due to the residual ( optical path and proof - mass ) noise sources .",
    "a technique for removing the uso noise from the tdi combinations was devised ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this technique requires the modulation of the laser beams exchanged by the spacecraft , and the further measurement of six more inter - spacecraft relative phases by comparing the sidebands of the received beam against sidebands of the transmitted beam .",
    "the physical reason behind the use of modulated beams for calibrating the usos noises is to exchange the usos phase fluctuations with the same time delay as their lasers among the three spacecraft by performing side - bands / side - bands measurements  @xcite . in so doing",
    ", additional six phase measurements are generated that allow one to calibrate out the usos phase fluctuations from the tdi combinations while preserving the gravitational wave signal in the resulting uso - calibrated tdi data .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that if we could coherently transfer the laser phase fluctuations to the microwave signal used in the heterodyne measurements , then we would need to cancel only one noise ( the laser noise ) , which might be possible by deriving some new tdi combinations .",
    "coherently linking optical laser frequencies to microwave frequencies has been thought to be impossible because of the inability to directly count the optical frequency of a laser .",
    "however , with the recent advent of the self - referenced octave - span optical frequency comb ( ofc ) scheme ( for which hall  @xcite and hnsch  @xcite received the physics nobel prize in @xmath5 ) it is now possible to generate a microwave frequency signal that is coherent to the frequency of the laser at a level significantly better than the frequency stability required of a uso to avoid the modulation - driven uso noise calibration procedure .",
    "although most of the reported implementations of the self - referenced frequency comb technique have been performed in a laboratory environment , active developments are being made for space - qualified ofc systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , more recent micro comb source developments promise much smaller and integratable comb devices  @xcite .",
    "if each spacecraft could then generate heterodyne measurements by relying on the ofc technique , then the question to be answered is whether there exist new tdi combinations that could account for the modified laser noise transfer functions into the heterodyne measurements .",
    "the answer to this question is yes , and in what follows we will derive their expressions .    in section  [ secii ]",
    "we give a brief summary of the ofc technique , and of characteristics of a self - referenced comb . in section  [ seciii ] we then exemplify through a simple interferometric configuration illustrating how the `` uso noise '' can be canceled with tdi when the ofc technique is implemented . in the same section",
    "we then move on to the realistic configuration of a space - based interferometer ( such as lisa ) and derive the expressions for the twelve inter - spacecraft heterodyne phase measurements when the ofc technique is used .",
    "this allows us to obtain the new second - generation ( i.e. flex - free ) tdi combinations  @xcite that simultaneously cancel the laser and the comb - generated microwave signal phase noises . in section  [ seciv ]",
    "we finally present our concluding remarks , and emphasize that the use of the ofc technique will result into a hardware and system design simplification , and increase system reliability of future space - based gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "an ofc is a set of narrow spectral lines equally spaced in the frequency domain .",
    "more importantly , when all the comb lines are phase coherent ( i.e. have fixed phase relationship ) the superposition of all the comb lines manifest themselves as a periodical wave train in the time domain .",
    "the resulting repetition rate is equal to the comb spacing and it is governed by the fourier transform relationship .",
    "more often , the comb lines are in phase so the time domain waveform is a train of short pulses separated by the inverse of the repetition rate .",
    "the pulse width is then fourier transform limited by the comb spectral width .",
    "typical ofcs are generated by mode - locked lasers in which multiple modes are locked in phase , outputting short pulse trains .",
    "the pulse train propagates with a group velocity while the underline optical carrier travels at the phase velocity .",
    "when the modes are exactly in phase , the peak of the carrier is aligned with the peak of the pulse envelope , as shown in the first pulse in figure  [ pulsetrain ] . in the absence of any dispersion , this relationship holds over time as the pulse propagates . in practice",
    ", dispersion changes the relative phases of the modes , and the peak of the carrier amplitude shifts from that of the pulse envelope .",
    "this offset is typically referred to as carrier envelope offset ( ceo ) phase shift and the rate of this offset phase change over a period gives the ceo frequency  @xcite , as shown in the frequency domain spectrum in figure  [ pulsetrain ] .",
    "in particular , this implies the well known mode frequency relation : @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath7 is affected by dispersion , as there are many environmental effects influencing it , @xmath7 is not a stable parameter and , as a consequence , there is no fixed frequency or phase relationship between the optical carrier and the pulse envelope , i.e. the beat - note of the rf signals among the modes . for many years before the recent self - referenced ofc development",
    ", the two frequencies were kept separate and used independently .",
    "recent advancements in the study of ultra - fast phenomena and the field of optical frequency metrology have revolutionized the use of ofc with abilities to measure and control the ceo . as shown in reference  @xcite , if one compares the @xmath8th harmonic of the @xmath9th mode with the @xmath10th harmonic of the @xmath11th mode , the beat note of the two yields @xmath12 . in particular , if the comb has an octave spanning width where one can choose @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the mixing beat - note of 1f-2f directly gives the measure of the ceo frequency . like in a typical phase locking loop ,",
    "the measured ceo phase can be used to stabilize the ceo itself , resulting in an ofc that has the well - defined relationship between the optical frequencies @xmath15 in the modes and the rf frequency of the repetition rate @xmath16 , now referred to as _ self - referencing _  @xcite .",
    "such control capability not only allows one to align carrier amplitude peaks with the short pulse envelopes in ultrafast phenomena study , but more revolutionarily provides the optical frequency divider ability down to microwave in one simple step . in the latter case with a self - referenced comb ,",
    "what it means is that the optical field in the comb has a coherent phase relationship with its rf beat - note signal and one can count the optical frequency by counting the rf frequency .",
    "furthermore , the optical phase noise is also directly down converted to the rf phase noise .",
    "recent studies have shown that the comb frequency precision can be at @xmath17  @xcite while the ceo phase can be controlled down to the mrad level . in the context of the investigation in this paper , the properties of the phase coherent optical divider",
    "are exploited for the onboard clock phase noise cancellation and for the generation of stable onboard rf signals directly from the comb .",
    "the most mature self - referenced ofcs are generated with a combination of femtosecond mode locked laser and super - continuum generation to achieve octave spanning spectrum width . while both ti : saphire and fiber mode locked lasers are successfully implemented for self referencing , the most suitable laser source for space interferometer mission may be fiber laser based systems .",
    "in fact , self - referencing comb systems are now commercially available , mostly for laboratory applications .",
    "efforts are being made in developing the fiber ofc technology for space applications .",
    "a flight ofc system is being developed for sounding rocket experiments  @xcite , and a femtosecond fiber laser has already been flown in space  @xcite .",
    "it is in fact expected that a flight ofc system , suitable for space missions , will become available in the near future .",
    "more recently it has been shown that coherent ofc can also be generated using high - q micro resonators through kerr nonlinear four wave mixing process  @xcite . in this case , a cw laser is resonantly injected into the resonator and strongly confined in the small volume mode .",
    "the high q - factor leads further field buildup in the resonator , which enhances the kerr nonlinear effect in the micro resonator .",
    "various cavity eigenmodes can , therefore , be excited through four - wave mixing as the laser light sequentially cascades from the pump to the other modes  @xcite , forming an optical comb with spacing determined by the resonator mode space , free spectral range .",
    "when the condition is right , these modes are phase locked in a soliton form , very much like a typical mode locked laser  @xcite . in comparison with their mode - locked lasers counterparts , however , these whispering galery mode optical frequency comb generators are characterized by a significantly reduced size and power consumption , along with a high repetition rate .",
    "they are , therefore , particularly suitable for miniaturization , chip integration , and space applications . for the purpose of self - referencing in optical metrology ,",
    "it is important that the comb spans over one octave for 1f-2f self - reference , or at least 2/3 of an octave for 2f-3f self - referencing .",
    "while self - referenced micro comb are still been developed in research labs , we believe space - qualified , compact kerr combs will be available in the near future .",
    "the striking property of the self - referenced ofc is the phase coherence between the optical carriers and their rf beat note signal .",
    "as it will be shown later , this allows the laser and resulting microwave signal phase noises cancellation elegantly in the generalized tdi combinations .",
    "furthermore , one can take advantage of the onboard frequency stabilized laser system to generate a stable microwave signal .",
    "since the onboard stabilized lasers are expected to achieve a stability at the level of @xmath18 or better over the frequency range of interests to space interferometer gravitational wave detection , by phase - locking the optical frequency comb to the stabilized laser , the corresponding rf beat - note stability will be also of a few parts in @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the stabilized ofc technique will provide an rf signal that can be significantly more stable of the current best space - qualified usos .",
    "the ofc implementation will not only eliminate the need for separate usos but also remove entirely the need for modulated beams used by the uso calibration method , as it will be shown in the following sections .",
    "in the following subsections we derive the modified expressions of the second - generation  @xcite tdi combinations that simultaneously cancel the laser and the microwave phase noises when the ofc technique is implemented . to physically understand how this is possible , we will first consider a simple interferometer configuration in which the rate - of - changes of the arm - lengths are large enough to require the removal of the beat - notes from the two - way data but small enough to treat the arm - lengths as constant . this will allow us to establish the basis for then deriving new second - generation tdi combinations that a three - arms , six laser links space - based interferometer can generate .      let us consider the following idealized unequal - arm interferometer whose end - mirrors are moving with velocities @xmath20 and @xmath21 along the directions of arms 1 and 2 respectively ( see figure [ 2unequalarms ] ) .",
    "these velocities are relative to the inertial reference frame in which the laser and the beam - splitters are at rest .",
    "the two light beams coming out of the two arms are not made to interfere at a common photodetector as each is made to interfere with the incoming light from the laser at a photodetector .",
    "this is because direct recombination of the beams at a single photodetector would not suppress the laser phase noise in the phase difference measurement due to the inequality of the arms .",
    "the velocities of the mirrors can be assumed to have frequency components that are outside the band of operation of the interferometer , while their amplitudes are such as to require the use of a numerically controlled oscillator ( nco ) ( driven by a clock ) to remove the beat - notes in the two `` two - way '' heterodyne phase measurements , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . as a result of this `` down - conversion '' operation ,",
    "the two - way data assume the following forms and @xmath24 are assumed to be equal to @xmath25    @xmath26 t + p(t - 2l_1 ) - p(t ) - a_1 q(t ) + h_1(t ) + n_1(t ) , \\label{2doppler1 } \\\\",
