    "elemental abundance of recently discovered extremely iron - deficient stars has raised questions about the mass range of the first stars that were formed in the universe @xcite .",
    "general theoretical considerations seem to suggest that , due to inefficeint cooling of the primordial gas , the first stars were at least as massive as 100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , other studies claim that molecular or atomic hydrogen cooling is sufficient to form low - mass stars from the primordial gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of signatures constraining the mass range of the first stars limits the possible formation mechanisms of these objects .",
    "the key parameters controlling the structure and evolution of stars are mass and metallicity .",
    "a given combination of these two parameters establishes new pathways for supernova ( sn ) formation from _  primordial intermediate mass \" _ stars .",
    "according to recent calculations @xcite , stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 and masses in the range of 3.5@xmath3 7 do not experience mixing episodes including the third dredge - up , in their convective envelope in the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tpagb ) phase .",
    "these stars will end up with a small amount of carbon as well as @xmath4-process elements in their envelopes . as a result , these stars are less opaque and more compact than stars that have experienced the third dredge - up",
    ". these features also result in stars with lower radiation pressures and stronger surface gravities .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the mass loss from an extremely metal - poor star will be substantially suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , a degenerate carbon - oxygen core can reach the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath5 ) while the star is in the tpagb phase .",
    "eventually the star undergoes a thermonuclear explosion to become an sn .",
    "this type of sn can be classified as a type ia in terms of nucleosynthesis but as a type ii in terms of spectral type .",
    "if the mass of a proto - galactic cloud is @xmath6 corresponding to the jeans mass soon after recombination , a typical type ii sn ( sn ii ) enriches the cloud up to [ fe / h]@xmath7 .",
    "therefore only the primordial ( population iii ) stars are likely to end up as such sne . hence",
    ", we define them as sne iiia .",
    "the lifetime of an sn iiia progenitor is much shorter than that of an sn ia progenitor , though these two types of sne supply similar amounts of nuclear products . in a white dwarf ,",
    "an sn ia event needs substantial replenishment of the gas by accretion from a low - mass companion . as a result ,",
    "sn ia progenitors have much longer evolutionary time - scales than those of sne ii @xmath8 , typically longer than @xmath9 yrs @xmath8 .",
    "this prevented sne ia from contributing to chemical enrichment in the early epoch of galaxy evolution .",
    "on the other hand , an sn iiia event occurs when an intermediate mass star evolves into the agb phase in a period ranging from several @xmath10 yrs to a few @xmath11 yrs , depending on the progenitor mass .",
    "such short time scales could enable us to detect evidence of the above in the elemental abundances of old stars .",
    "recent studies of the chemical composition of metal - poor stars have revealed that they have inherited the abundance pattern of the ejecta of the preceding sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , there might be some later stars that inherited the nuclear products of sne iiia , though their abundance patterns could be modified to some degree by products from sne ii .",
    "the most characteristic abundance feature of stars inheriting the nuclear products of an sne iiia event is expected to be the deficiency of @xmath12-elements , compared with the enhanced @xmath12/fe ratios commonly seen in halo stars .",
    "in fact , there exist so - called low-@xmath12 stars in the galactic halo with low @xmath12/fe ratios .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that these low-@xmath12 stars were born from accreted dwarf galaxies or protogalactic fragments , where a prolonged low star formation rate enables sne ia events to occur in a low - metallicity regime . the specific mechanism which explains the low @xmath13fe ratios in an individual star",
    "is easily determined by the abundance of @xmath4-process elements , since the time scales associated with these two types of sne are substantially different .",
    "the long lifetime of sne ia allows agb stars to substantially pollute the gas with @xmath4-process elements before low-@xmath12 stars are formed , whereas sne iiia preceded most agb stars with masses @xmath14 .    in the literature",
    ", we found three stars ( bd+80@xmath15245 and hd 134439/40 ) that exhibit the abundance patterns expected from sne iiia .",
    "elemental features of these three stars are discussed in the subsequent two sections .",
    "their origin is investigated in the context of a chemical evolution model developed by @xcite in  [ ee ] .",
    "the conspicuous abundance feature of the star bd @xmath0245 is the deficiency of @xmath12-elements and @xmath16-capture elements , such as ba or eu , and low ratios of na , al , sc , zn relative to fe @xcite . in the supernova - induced star formation scenario proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the stellar abundance pattern is determined by the combination of heavy elements ejected from an sn itself and those elements that are already present in the interstellar gas due to previous sn ii explosions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the deficiency not only of @xmath12-elements but also of @xmath16-capture and odd - numbered elements should be attributed to an additional fe supply from an sn iiia .",
    "since an sn iiia produces few @xmath12-elements , if we take the abundance ratios of these elements to mg instead of fe , both bd+80@xmath15245 and hd 134439/40 become indistinguishable from other halo stars ( see fig .  1 ) . in other words ,",
    "the abundance of the interstellar medium ( ism ) [ mg / h]@xmath17 at the birth epoch of this star must be equal to the observed abundance of bd+80@xmath15245 , [ mg / h]@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the abundance ratio is equal to the average ratio for halo stars [ mg / fe]@xmath17=0.4 , the fe abundance in the ism is estimated to be [ fe / h]@xmath17=@xmath19 . adding another @xmath20of the fe supplied by the preceding sn iiia to the @xmath21 of the gas swept up by the sn remnant @xcite , the metallicity of a star formed from this gas becomes [ fe / h]=@xmath22 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed value of [ fe / h]=@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "another reason for connecting stellar abundance features with a pop iii sn iiia is the deficiency of odd - numbered elements ( mn , co ) compared to even - numbered ones ( cr , ni ) among the fe - group .",
    "this feature may favor nucleosynthesis in primordial sne , since odd nuclear charge numbered elements require the pre - existence of heavy element seeds in the sn progenitor . among these fe - group elements ,",
    "mn abundance best distinguishes the products of sne iiia from those of sne ia .",
    "if an sn ia , instead of an sn iiia , supplied the mn and the fe to the gas from which this star formed , then a theoretical sn ia model @xcite would predict that the [ mn / fe ] ratio in the gas , which was initially @xmath24 , would become @xmath25 after being swept up by the sn . in fact , the observed [ mn / fe ] = @xmath26 @xcite implies that the mn yield from an sn iiia is about one - third that of an sn ia . likewise",
    ", the ejecta of an sn ia would result in [ co / fe]@xmath27 , whereas observations show [ co / fe]=@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "relationship for the gas in the protogalactic cloud .",
    "sn iiia progenitor masses corresponding to different stellar lifetimes are also indicated .",
    "the shaded areas denote [ mg / h ] abundances with errors for bd+80@xmath15245 and hd 134439 .",
    "the [ mg / h ] abundance of hd 134440 is not shown since it only differs by 0.05 dex from that of hd 134439.,width=302 ]",
    "the pair of stars hd 134439/40 @xcite also appear to inherit the abundance pattern of the ejecta of an sn iiia .",
    "they both exhibit the deficiency of @xmath12- and @xmath16-capture elements similar to bd @xmath0245 , but to a lesser extent @xcite .",
    "this mild deficiency is naturally interpreted in the framework of the evolution of stellar abundances in the galactic halo .",
    "the relatively small contribution of sne iiia to stellar abundance is attributed to a less massive progenitor star .",
    "its longer lifetime allows more numerous sne ii to enrich the interstellar matter until the star is formed . in  [ ee ] , it will be shown that the unusual elemental abundances of these three stars are linked to the unique evolutionary track of stellar abundances in the ejecta of sne iiia with different progenitor masses .",
    "in this section , we will discuss how the unusual elemental abundances seen in the three stars under discussion can be modeled theoretically . the chemical evolution considered here",
    "is based on a scenario @xcite in which the stellar abundances change through successive sequences of the sn explosion , shell formation , and star formation from the matter swept up by the individual sn remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "heavy elements ejected from an sn are assumed to be trapped and well mixed within the snr shell .",
    "a fraction of this heavy element material is then incorporated into the next generation stars , while the material remaining in the gas will mix with the ambient medium .",
    "the mass fraction of the first - generation stars is introduced as a free parameter in this model , and this value is assumed to be @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "details of this process are given in @xcite .",
    "first , we show the evolution of [ mg / h ] in the gas ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "since an sn iiia supplies only a small amount of mg , the mg abundances of the stars introduced in the preceding sections coincide with the abundance of the interstellar gas at the birth epochs of the stars .",
    "thus , this age-[mg / h ] relation can be used to date these stars .",
    "that is , for a given [ mg / h ] value , the progenitor mass of the sn iiia for each star can be deduced .",
    "the resultant masses are 5 for bd @xmath0245 and 3.5 for hd 134439 .",
    "these inferred masses are within the allowed mass range ( @xmath30 ) for sn iiia progenitors .",
    "the lower bound mass is required for the inhibition of mixing processes in the convective envelope @xcite , while the upper bound mass is the lower limit at which hydrostatic carbon burning will occur in the stellar core @xcite .",
    "in contrast to mg abundance , stellar fe abundance inherited from sn iiia remnants differs from that in the interstellar gas , which leads to unusual elemental [ x / fe ] ratios for these stars . since the amount of heavy elements contained in the gas increases with time , the major contributor to stellar metallicity switches from sn ejecta to the metallicity in the interstellar gas .",
    "therefore , the delay in sn iiia explosions reduces the anomalies of the [ x / fe ] ratios . as a result",
    ", the [ x / fe ] ratios of stars trace the continuous evolutionary track in figure 3 , which considers the assemblage of elements in the ejecta of individual sne iiia , with different progenitor masses , in addition to the elements in the ism . as well",
    ", this figure shows the model curves for the evolutionary change in [ mg / fe ] ( left panel ) and [ si / fe ] ( right panel ) ratios together with the observed data for the three stars @xcite and numerous other galactic stars with _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite . for the nucleosynthetic yields of mg ,",
    "si , and fe in sne iiia , those predicted by the w7 model of sne ia @xcite are adopted .",
    "a small mg yield in sn iiia leads to the formation of stars with an abundance ratio , [ mg / fe ] , as low as @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , a relatively large si yield in sn iiia results in stars with an [ si / fe ] ratio @xmath32 . theoretically , the mass swept up by an snr is dependent on the local gas density @xcite and is found to lie within a factor of @xmath333 about the mean of @xmath21@xcite . in this study , we consider a factor of 1.25 larger than this ( dashed curves ) together with the typical case ( solid curves ) ( see figure 3 ) . taking into account the incomplete mixing of elements from different sne inside the inhomogeneous ism , we calculated the abundance ratio of stars formed from sne iiia with two different values of the gaseous [ mg ( si)/fe ] , i.e. , 0.4 ( upper two curves ) and 0.25 ( lower two curves ) .",
    "these results reveal that the observed lower [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] ratios for the three stars are well described by the unified scheme .",
    "this scheme proposes that these stars were formed from the gas swept up by sne iiia with different progenitor masses during different epochs .    moreover , the predicted relationships between [ ba / fe ] and [ fe / h ] , as well as [ eu / fe ] and [ fe / h ] , for the three stars also agree with the observed ratios , as shown in the two panels of figure 4 . the evolution of [ ba / fe ] in the gas is calculated assuming that the production site for early - epoch @xmath4-process elements is @xmath34 agb stars , which is shown by the dash - dotted curve .",
    "it was assumed that the [ eu / fe ] ratio in the gas is 0.5 .",
    "the predicted [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] sequences of stars formed from sne iiia with different progenitor masses are completely different from the evolution of gaseous abundances , as is shown by the solid and dashed curves .",
    "thus , the remarkably low [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] ratios for bd @xmath0245 are attributable to an early sn iiia explosion in very low - metallicity gas due to a relatively massive ( @xmath35 ) progenitor . on the other hand , the sn iiia progenitor ,",
    "having imprinted the relatively high [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] ratios in hd 134439/40 , was less massive ( @xmath36 ) than the sn iiia progenitor forming bd+80@xmath15245 . at the same time , the model curves in figures 3 and 4 predict the location of stars formed from sne iiia in the [ @xmath12/fe]-[fe / h ] and [ @xmath16-capture / fe]-[fe / h ] planes .",
    "finally it should be noted that heavy elements ejected from sne iiia are expected to have little influence on the overall enrichment of interstellar gas , since sne iiia , whose progenitors are first - generation stars , are underpopulated , and sne ii had already enriched the interstellar gas with heavy elements before the emergence of sn iiia .",
    "the unusually low abundances of @xmath12- and neutron - capture elements relative to fe seen in the metal - poor star bd @xmath0245 and the pair of stars hd 134439/40 are shown to be fossil records of sn explosions triggered by a thermonuclear runaway in a metal free intermediate mass star .",
    "these sne have two distinct characteristics .",
    "first , they can be classified as type ia in terms of nucleosynthesis , that is , they synthesize a large amount of fe as a result of the thermonuclear explosions .",
    "second , for their cores to grow to the chandrasekhar limit during the tpagb phase , the progenitors need to be metal - free stars .",
    "since the three stars exhibit these two characteristics ,  a sufficient fe supply on a short time - scale \" and  primordiality \" in their elemental abundance patterns , this strongly suggests that there must be metal - free stars of a few solar masses .",
    "we also predict that stars inheriting heavy elements from sne iiia populate distinct branches in the [ @xmath12/fe]@xmath8[fe / h ] and [ @xmath16-capture / fe]@xmath8[fe / h ] planes .",
    "the manner in which these stars populate this branch should give valuable information on the initial mass function of metal - free stars .",
    "stars descended from sne iiia are predicted to have metallicities in the range of @xmath37@xmath38 .",
    "thus , the eight low-@xmath12 halo stars with @xmath39 \\leq -0.8 $ ] @xcite , and d119 with [ fe / h ] = @xmath40 exhibiting extreme deficiencies of ca , sr , and ba in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite , are unlikely to be associated with the proposed sne iiia .",
    "theoretically during the formation of galaxies , stars form in the protogalactic clouds assembling to construct the galactic halo . a spread of several billion years in the stellar age among the halo stars @xcite suggests that heavy elements dispersed into the halo from the protoclouds should have polluted other clouds before star formation had started there . thus",
    ", the formation of metal - free stars must have started at a very early epoch and , accordingly , very far from the galactic center .",
    "thus , stars inheriting heavy elements from pop iii sne are expected to share kinematic features of the outermost halo population , such as large apo - galactic orbital radii with high eccentricities .",
    "observations reveal that the three stars examined in the current letter do indeed possess such kinematic features @xcite .",
