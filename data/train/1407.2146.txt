    "<S> , the schmidt rank of a state , therefore , can be considered as a resource . </S>",
    "<S> identifying the schmidt rank of a state is also important for quantifying the power of quantum correlations , a central issue in quantum information theory . in this work </S>",
    "<S> the problem of determining the schmidt rank of an unknown bipartite state has been addressed . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has been shown that considering a modified version of the hardy s paradox , recently introduced by chen _ </S>",
    "<S> et.al _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can know the minimal schmidt rank of the given unknown state . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides information about the minimal hilbert space dimension of the concerned system . </S>",
    "<S> the use of nonlocality argument in this task comes up with a novel advantage . </S>",
    "<S> the schmidt rank can be determined from measurement data alone , in a scenario in which all devices used in the experiment , including the measurement device , are uncharacterized or in other words no assumption about the internal working of the devices is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> the original hardy s argument was defined for _ dichotomic _ observables , i.e. , observables with two outcomes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors in ref.@xcite have generalized it for observables with arbitrary many outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they have shown that , unlike the original hardy s argument , the success probability of the many - outcome argument increases with the increase of the system s dimension . in this work </S>",
    "<S> the three - outcome hardy s argument has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it has been shown that neither a @xmath26-qubit state nor a qubit - qutrit state exhibits this argument for three - outcome generalized measurement , i.e. , positive - operator - valued - measurement ( povm ) @xcite . using this result </S>",
    "<S> it has been further shown that this argument can be designed as a device independent schmidt rank as well as hilbert space dimension witness .    before going to the main result </S>",
    "<S> a quick overview on the hardy s argument has been presented . </S>",
    "<S> l. hardy provided an elegant argument which , like bell s inequality @xcite , reveals nonlocality within quantum mechanics @xcite and it is commonly called ` hardy paradox ' . </S>",
    "<S> hardy s proof is usually considered `` the simplest form of bell s theorem '' @xcite . the argument requires two spatially separated observers , say alice and bob , each with two measurements ( the measurements for alice and bob are denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , with @xmath29 ) , each with two possible outcomes denoted by ` @xmath30 ' and ` @xmath24 ' . </S>",
    "<S> it puts restrictions on a certain choice of @xmath31 out of @xmath32 joint probabilities in the correlation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> one such choice is :    @xmath33    [ hardy ]    here @xmath34 denotes the conditional joint probability of obtaining outcome ` @xmath35 ' by alice and outcome ` @xmath2 ' by bob when they perform measurement @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ; @xmath36 . the non zero probability in eq.([hardy ] ) </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. left hand side of eq.([h4 ] ) ) is called hardy s success probability , @xmath37 . for @xmath26-qubit system </S>",
    "<S> the maximum achievable value of hardy s success is @xmath38 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that for @xmath26-qudit system this maximum success probability remains same @xcite , i.e. , for showing the contradiction of quantum mechanics with _ local realism _ , higher dimensional systems give no advantage in experimental implementation of such a test .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the authors in @xcite have introduced a hardy like argument for @xmath39-outcome measurements , i.e. , @xmath40 . denoting the joint conditional probability as @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> the argument reads as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . for two outcomes the argument boils down to the original hardy s argument , i.e. eq.([hardy ] ) . for three outcomes </S>",
    "<S> their argument explicitly looks :    @xmath46    [ hardy3 ]    likewise ( [ h4 ] ) , the left hand side in ( [ h34 ] ) measures the success probability of three - outcome hardy s test and similarly for the @xmath39-outcome cases . higher value of this quantity implies that experimentally it is easier to demonstrate the contradiction of quantum mechanics with _ </S>",
    "<S> local realism_.    in quantum theory the joint conditional probabilities are calculated as : @xmath47 where , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are povms acting on alice s and bob s side respectively and @xmath50 is the shared state between alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath26-qudit pure states and projective measurements the authors in @xcite find the optimal success probability for @xmath39-outcome hardy s test . </S>",
    "<S> as for example , for @xmath51-outcome case the optimal achievable success probability is @xmath52 , which is strictly greater than the optimal two - outcome hardy s success probability . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be achieved by performing three - outcome projective measurements on @xmath26-qutrit system . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to imply that the success probability increases with increasing system s dimension . </S>",
    "<S> however this implication is not conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> cause it has not yet been proved that by sharing a @xmath53 state ( or @xmath54 state ) and performing three - outcome generalized measurement one can not exhibit the hardy s paradox ( [ hardy3 ] ) with success probability greater than @xmath55 . in the following a more powerful result </S>",
    "<S> has been proved  that neither a @xmath26-qubit state nor a qubit - qutrit state exhibits the three - outcome hardy s paradox ( [ hardy3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first the 2-qubit case has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> let alice and bob share a 2-qubit state . both of them perform two three - outcome povms , with outcomes denoted by @xmath56 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath57 denote the povm element corresponding to alice s outcome @xmath35 and similarly @xmath58 for bob s outcome @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have : @xmath59 there are following possible cases : ( i ) all the povm elements are rank one operators ; ( ii ) some of the povm elements may have more than one rank . in the course of analysis , intuitively , it will become clear that if the measurements with rank one povm elements do not pass the three - outcome hardy s test then it is even more difficult for the measurements with higher rank povm elements to pass it .    </S>",
    "<S> * case ( i ) * : in this case all the povm elements can be considered as proportional to projection operators on some ray vectors , i.e. , @xmath60,~~\\mbox{and}~~\\mathcal{f}^n_j\\propto\\pi[\\phi_j^n],\\ ] ] where @xmath61\\equiv|\\psi_i^m\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i^m|$ ] and @xmath62\\equiv|\\phi_j^n\\rangle\\langle\\phi_j^n|$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-qubit state that exhibits the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) must satisfy the conditions ( [ h31])-([h33 ] ) , which imply that each term on the left hand side of these equations must be zero . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath63 implies that the concerned 2-qubit state is orthogonal to the product vector @xmath64 and similar is true for other cases . </S>",
    "<S> thus the conditions ( [ h31])-([h33 ] ) altogether imply that the concerned state must be orthogonal to the following nine vectors : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 without loss of generality , consider @xmath70 as the basis for alice s qubit system . </S>",
    "<S> other states on alice s side when written in linear combination of this basis , read as :    @xmath71    similarly choosing @xmath72 as the basis for bob s qubit :    @xmath73    consider the set latexmath:[$\\{|\\psi_1 ^ 0\\rangle\\otimes|\\phi_1 ^ 0\\rangle,|\\psi_1 ^ 0\\rangle\\otimes|\\phi_1 ^ 1\\rangle,|\\psi_1 ^ 1\\rangle\\otimes|\\phi_1 ^ 0\\rangle ,    product space @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the nine vectors in the set @xmath75 written in the above basis read as :    @xmath76    among the above nine vectors if it turns out that four are linearly independent then those four vectors span the whole 2-qubit tensor product hilbert space and hence there will be no vector to exhibit the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) . however , from the above expressions it is clear that the set of vectors @xmath77 is linearly independent . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider the set @xmath78 then it will be linearly dependent provided @xmath79=-\\alpha_1 ^ 2\\beta_1 ^ 2\\gamma_2 ^ 1=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([a1 ] ) tells that neither @xmath80 nor @xmath81 can be zero . </S>",
    "<S> but , no such restriction applies for @xmath82 to be nonzero . in the similar way , </S>",
    "<S> analyzing the criteria for linear dependence of the different sets @xmath83 with @xmath84 , we obtain the following conditions : @xmath85 for exhibiting the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) the concerned 2-qubit state must be orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the set @xmath77 and this unique state reads as : @xmath86 as the state turns out to be a product state it can not manifest the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * case(ii ) * : here all the povm elements are in general not rank one operator . to satisfy the conditions ( [ h31])-([h33 ] ) the concerned 2-qubit state must be orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the following nine product operators :    .any @xmath26-qubit state that manifest the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) must be orthogonal to the support of each of these nine product operators . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if @xmath87 is rank two and all others are rank one then it is straightforward to argue that ranges of these operators together span four dimension of the tensor product hilbert space @xmath53 and thus there is no space left for exhibiting hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar is true for other cases . </S>",
    "<S> in some cases ( e.g. @xmath88 is rank two and rest are rank one ) ranges of these operators together span three dimension and in such cases the analysis boils down to the case(i ) .    </S>",
    "<S> form the analysis so far presented , it is clear that no 2-qubit state exhibits the three - outcome hardy s argument . </S>",
    "<S> this fact provides information about the hilbert space dimension of the composite system s , i.e. , any system that manifests the hardy s argument ( [ hardy3 ] ) can not be a @xmath53 system . at this point </S>",
    "<S> one can not make any comment about the schmidt rank of the system , since a @xmath54 state may also have schmidt rank @xmath26 and can exhibit the hardy paradox ( [ hardy3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar analysis shows that no @xmath53 exhibits the hardy paradox ( [ hardy3 ] ) ( see the appendix ) .    </S>",

    "<S> independent scenario one does not have detailed knowledge about the experimental apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> so a black - box description of the experiment has been shown in fig([fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> on each side , the experimental device is depicted like a box with some knobs . </S>",
    "<S> a knob with different positions on each device , denoted respectively by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , allows alice and bob to change the parameters of each measuring apparatus .        </S>",
    "<S> each measurement performed by alice and bob has @xmath39 possible outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the frequencies @xmath34 of occurrence of a given pair of outcomes for each pair of measurements have been collected . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting statistics @xmath89 have been collected . </S>",
    "<S> it will be checked whether the collected statistics satisfy the conditions described in eq.([hardy3 ] ) . according to these conditions the left hand side of ( [ h34 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> must be strictly greater than zero . among the three terms of ( [ h34 ] ) if one is nonzero ( say , @xmath90 ) and the rest two are zero then also the required condition is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that sharing a @xmath26-qubit pure entangled state @xcite ( i.e. a state with schmidt rank two ) and performing suitable two - outcome measurements on each side the required conditions can be satisfied . here </S>",
    "<S> each of alice and bob will assign zero probability for the third outcome . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of left hand side of ( [ h34 ] ) can reach up to @xmath55 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can impose a more stringent restriction  that all the three terms in the left hand side of ( [ h34 ] ) should be nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> the previous analysis tells that in quantum theory this stringent conditions can not be satisfied by performing three - outcome generalized measurements on @xmath26-qubit ( qubit - qutrit ) state . </S>",
    "<S> however , alice and bob can have the following strategy . </S>",
    "<S> suppose they share the following higher dimensional state : @xmath91 where the particles @xmath92 and @xmath93 are in alice s lab and the particles @xmath94 and @xmath95 are in bob s lab . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath96 is a @xmath26-qubit pure entangled states and hence each of them are of schmidt rank two . here </S>",
    "<S> the primed particles behave as _ flag _ variable . whenever the primed particles are in the state @xmath97 ( which alice and bob can know by performing a von neumann measurement in @xmath98 basis ) then alice and bob certainly know that the unprimed particles are in the state @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the bipartition @xmath100 vs @xmath101 the schmidt number is two . </S>",
    "<S> if the state is @xmath102 , then on their respective particle ( unprimed ) they perform suitable two - outcome measurements , which exhibits the two - outcome hardy s argument ( [ hardy ] ) and rename the outcomes accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> thus they are able to make the first term in the left hand side of ( [ h34 ] ) nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , when the unprimed particles are in the state @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , alice and bob can make the second ( third ) term in ( [ h34 ] ) nonzero by performing suitable measurements and renaming the outcomes accordingly @xcite . sharing this type of states </S>",
    "<S> the stringent conditions , that all the terms in ( [ h34 ] ) are nonzero , can be satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> but , due to convexity the success probability can not be greater than @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , whenever the success probability is strictly greater than @xmath55 , the shared state must have schmidt rank greater than @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the information about the minimal schmidt rank of the shared bipartite system and importantly it has been done in device independent manner . </S>",
    "<S> it also gives information about the minimal dimension of the shared quantum system , that the resulting statistics can not be obtained from a @xmath26-qubit or a qubit - qutrit state .    </S>",
    "<S> besides revealing the the contradiction of quantum mechanics with local - realism hardy s argument also finds applications in various information theoretic tasks . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proved to be useful in witnessing post quantum correlations @xcite . in the recent times </S>",
    "<S> various device - independent @xcite information theoretic protocols like cryptography @xcite , randomness certification @xcite , hilbert spaces dimension witness @xcite make use of nonlocality arguments @xcite . in this work </S>",
