    "<S> we show that the dissipationless spin current in the ground state of the rashba model gives rise to a reactive coupling between the spin and charge propagation , which is formally identical to the coupling between the electric and the magnetic fields in the @xmath0 dimensional maxwell equation . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy leads to a remarkable prediction that a density packet can spontaneously split into two counter propagation packets , each carrying the opposite spins . in a certain parameter regime , </S>",
    "<S> the coupled spin and charge wave propagates like a transverse  photon \" . </S>",
    "<S> we propose both optical and purely electronic experiments to detect this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> 10000    the generation and manipulation of spin current is essential to the rapidly developing field of spintronics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , the analogy between photonics and spintronics greatly helped our conceptual developments , and this analogy lead to the celebrated das - datta proposal for a spin - field transistor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , earlier attempts to realize this conceptual device were based on the rather incomplete analogy between the electron spin and the photon , and were plagued by many issues such as low spin injection rate and the requirement of the ballistic spin transport .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the remarkable phenomenon of the dissipationless spin current has been theoretically predicted@xcite . a electric field @xmath1 generates a spin current described by the response equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current of the @xmath4-th component of the spin along the direction @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions and the spin hall conductivity @xmath7 does not depend on impurities . since both the spin current and the electric field are even under the time reversal , this equation describes a reactive response which does not dissipate energy . </S>",
    "<S> one natural consequence of this equation is the intrinsic spin hall effect @xcite , which has been recently observed experimentally in the hole doped systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another consequence is the dissipationless spin current in the ground state @xcite . in the above equation ( [ spin_response ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the electric field can be either externally applied , or can be spontaneously generated in systems without inversion symmetry . in a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , the confining potential along the @xmath8 direction breaks the inversion symmetry , and leads to a internal electric field @xmath9 in the ground state . according to equation ( [ spin_response ] ) , there is a spin current in the ground state , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the antisymmetric symbol in two dimensions with @xmath12 .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we shall show that the dissipationless spin current in the ground state makes the analogy between photonics and spintronics formally exact . in @xmath0 dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the electric field has two components , while the magnetic field has only one component . </S>",
    "<S> if one identifies them with the in - plane components of the spin density and the charge density , respectively , the boltzmann transport equation for the coupled spin and charge wave is formally the same as the maxwell equation describing the electromagnetic fields , where the  speed of light \" is given by the rashba coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in sharp contrast to the conventional boltzmann equation for the decoupled spin and charge dynamics in semiconductors , where only purely diffusive , but no propagating motion is predicted @xcite . the photonic analogy helps our understanding on how density gradient and time dependence can generate spin density , and leads to many novel predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that there is a parameter regime , reachable experimentally , where the coupled spin - charge wave propagates as a under - damped  photonic mode \" . </S>",
    "<S> a density packet will split spontaneously into two counter propagating packets , each carrying the opposite spins . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism enables injection of spins and spin currents . </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann transport equations for the rashba model have been studied previously in the diffusive region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled spin - charge wave propagation is a new result of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> a spin @xmath13 hamiltonian which includes spin orbit coupling can be written in the following general form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a odd function of @xmath16 , in order to preserve the time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this includes a wide range of spin - orbit couplings , including 2d rashba and dresselhaus couplings and the 3d spin splitting of the conduction band in strained semiconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space density distribution function @xmath17 and the energy matrix @xmath18 are @xmath19 matrices , and can be decomposed as : @xmath20 in this letter we consider the system in the absence of external fields , such that @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of electric and magnetic fields on the system is described in a future longer publication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann equation reads :    @xmath22   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\ { \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_f(p , r , t)}{\\partial p_i } , \\frac{\\partial n_f(p , r , t)}{\\partial r_i}\\ }    -\\frac{1}{2 } \\ </S>",
    "<S> { \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_f(p , r , t)}{\\partial r_i } , \\frac{\\partial n_f(p , r , t)}{\\partial p_i}\\ } = \\frac { n_f^{eq } - n_f(p , r , t)}{\\tau}\\ ] ]    where the right hand side is the collision term expressed in the relaxation time approximation , and @xmath23 is the equilibrium value of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is the momentum relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> although this approximation does not take into account the self - energy effects , it turns out to be qualitatively and quantitatively correct , as we see from comparison with the solution involving the self energy in some special cases of spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we trace out the matrix dependence of the distribution function as well as that of the energy , and integrate the continuity and the current equations over the fermi volume @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after linearization , we obtain @xcite : @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the diffusion constant and @xmath28 is the mobility , and the carriers are electrons of charge @xmath29 . aside from the self energy renormalizations , eq.[[generalcontinuityequations ] ] gives the same result as @xcite when particularized to the rashba - spin - orbit coupling . the last term in the spin continuity equation </S>",
    "<S> represents the spin relaxation due to dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism @xcite . in the case of rashba systems , </S>",
    "<S> the spin orbit coupling is @xmath30 , @xmath31 has the dimension of velocity , and the continuity equations become ( from now on we use @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) since charge and spin motion is now confined entirely to the 2d plane . within the current microscopic approximation , the dp spin relaxation time is given by @xmath37 , however , in the subsequent discussions , we shall treat @xmath38 and @xmath39 as independent , phenomenological parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath40 , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we can write the two dimensional vector @xmath42 in the most general form as a sum of a longitudinal vector @xmath43 and a transversal vector @xmath44 : @xmath45 substituting this decomposition into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rashbaboltzmann ] ) , we find two sets of coupled equations : @xmath46 and @xmath47 hence the charge density couples only to the transverse spin component , while @xmath48 couples only to the longitudinal spin component in a purely diffusive fashion@xcite . in the spin continuity equation of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwell ] ) , we see that the @xmath31 term is nothing but the divergence of the dissipationless spin current in the ground state @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that this term plays the crucial role leading to the coupled spin - charge propagation .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we come to a remarkable realization that the boltzmann equation ( [ maxwell ] ) for the coupled charge and transverse spin transport is exactly the maxwell s equation in @xmath0 dimensions ! in order to facilitate the comparison , let us first focus on the large spin - orbit coupling limit , where we neglect the @xmath38 and the @xmath50 terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwell ] ) . in @xmath0 dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the source - free maxwell equations are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> in @xmath0 dimensions , the magnetic field has only one component , given by @xmath53 , and the two components of the electric field are given by @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> if we make the identification @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we see that the three boltzmann transport equations in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxwell ] ) are exactly the three maxwell s equations in the vacuum of @xmath0 dimensions , namely the faraday s law of induction , the ampere - maxwell law , and the gauss s law . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the @xmath58 term can be interpreted as light propagation in a metallic media , with the current density in the ampere s law given by the ohm s law , and the @xmath38 terms can be interpreted as due to light diffusion in a random media .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we see propagation over distances of more than @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> * inset : * charge and spin density in the diffusive regime , for small values of @xmath31 ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath60 ) has the typical gaussian decay.,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",

    "<S> however , we see that in the limit of strong spin - orbit coupling , there is a regime where a propagating , coupled spin - charge wave mode is possible . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the diffusion and the lifetime terms for the time being , we find that the most general solution to the initial condition of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is given by : @xmath66 we see that an initial density wave packet spontaneously splits into two counter - propagating packets , each carrying the opposite spin . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can be elegantly interpreted in the  photonic \" language . in @xmath0 dimensions </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic field is always pointing along the @xmath67 direction . since the propagation vector @xmath68 , being proportional to the poynting vector , </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath69 , it uniquely determines the direction of the transverse electric field . </S>",
    "<S> translating from the  photonic \" language into the  spintronic \" language , we see that the mode propagating along the @xmath70 has spins along the @xmath71 direction , while the mode propagating along the @xmath72 has spins along the @xmath73 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the split wave packets carries a spin current @xmath74 , which is a reflection of the spin current in the ground state of the rashba model . for </S>",
    "<S> a simple estimate , @xmath75 , and hence the mode will cross a sample of @xmath76 length in @xmath77 . considering that the spin coherence time in these samples can be larger than @xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> it means that the propagation time over @xmath79 distance is well shorter than @xmath80-th part of the spin relaxation time and can hence be very useful for spin manipulation .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the more general situation including diffusion and relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that a one dimensional stripe of charge density has been created , say by transient grating @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial density is given by @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to the full equations give @xmath82 while @xmath83 is generated by the spin - orbit coupling : @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the characteristic frequencies of the system : @xmath87 we recognize the propagating mode inside the square root . for momenta @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> both characteristic frequencies contain real parts and hence describe propagating waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath89 must not be as large as to cause damping due to the term @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for this gaussian damping to be small is @xmath91 for @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the condition for the regime where a propagating mode could exist is then given by : @xmath93 this condition can be satisfied in samples where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with @xmath39 longer than @xmath78 @xcite . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 , much smaller than @xmath31 .        in the limit of very long </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 the integrals can be solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we give the expression of @xmath98 in this limit : @xmath99\\ ] ] the propagating mode is @xmath100 where either one of the damping gaussian exponentials becomes unity . </S>",
    "<S> the spin symmetry is odd in @xmath101 , the spins propagating in the positive and negative @xmath101 axis directions having opposite polarization . </S>",
    "<S> note that for diminishing spin - orbit coupling @xmath102 the spin density also vanishes , as it should . for finite @xmath39 in a stationary phase - type approximation </S>",
    "<S> the spin - density solution above gets multiplied by an exponential factor @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> impressively , both spin and charge can propagate over distances well in excess of @xmath61 and for times well in excess of @xmath104 , ( the full time scale is not plotted in fig[[chargedensity ] ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now propose several experiments to test the coupled spin - charge wave predicted in this work . </S>",
    "<S> one could inject the density packet optically , and detect the splitting of the density packet and the associated spin orientation by optical kerr rotation . </S>",
    "<S> one could also detect the spin orientation through the circularly polarized luminance from the recombination with the majority carriers . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could detect the propagation of the density packet purely electrically , by a modified version of the classic haynes - shockley experiment@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ shockley ] ) describes a narrow sample with light p - doping . </S>",
    "<S> two rectifying metal - to - semiconductor point contacts are forward and reverse biased , respectively , to serve as emitter and collector electrodes . after turning on the emitter pulse , a electron density packet is injected into the sample . in conventional haynes - shockley setup </S>",
    "<S> , the electron packet would be swept to the collector electrode by a electric field . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> no sweeping electric field is applied , but the density packet will spontaneously split into two counter propagating packets with the opposite spin orientation , with a velocity directly given by the rashba coupling constant @xmath31 . when the right moving packet is captured by the collector electrode , </S>",
    "<S> a voltage pulse is registered . from the time - delay and the shape of the voltage pulse </S>",
    "<S> , one can determine the rashba coupling constant and the diffusion constant by purely electric means . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment illustrates the fact that the injected density pulse can take advantage of the spin current in the ground state , and propagate without any applied voltage . </S>"
