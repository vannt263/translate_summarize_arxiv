    "charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) in use in x - ray astronomy combine moderate energy resolution with good spatial resolution@xcite . thanks to these characteristics , they have become a standard x - ray photon counting detector . when an x - ray photon is photoabsorbed inside a ccd , a number of electrons proportional to the incident x - ray energy are liberated . in this way , the energy of an x - ray photon can be measured . because optical photons can produce only a few electrons , however , ccds have no energy resolution at optical wavelengths .",
    "the charge cloud produced by an x - ray photon inside the ccd drifts within the depletion region to the bottom of the potential well of the given pixel , resulting in a detected x - ray event .",
    "due to the diffusion process , the charge cloud has a finite size , which can result in the event being detected in more than one pixel .",
    "x - ray events may be therefore classified by grade  according to the number of pixels in which they are detected .",
    "when the entire charge cloud is collected within one pixel , for example , it is referred to as a single pixel event .",
    "when the cloud splits into an adjacent horizontal pixel , it is referred to as a horizontally split event .",
    "similarly , when the cloud splits into an adjacent vertical pixel , it is referred to as a vertically split event .",
    "a ccd consists of a two dimensional array of small pixels .",
    "the spatial resolution is limited by the pixel size which is typically several tens of @xmath0 m .",
    "the electrode structure , which comprises layers of poly - silicon and silicon - oxide , results in a non - uniformity of detection efficiency over the pixel . in order to measure the structure of one pixel directly ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine the x - ray interaction position on a scale smaller than the pixel size .",
    "recently , we have developed a new technique which allows us to specify the x - ray interaction position with sub - pixel resolution using a two - dimensional mesh containing small holes ( much smaller than the ccd pixel size ) which are periodically spaced  @xcite .",
    "the sub - pixel structure of various types of ccd ( asca sis  @xcite , chandra acis  @xcite and hpk ccd  @xcite ) have been measured using this method .",
    "the x - ray response of a ccd is very sensitive to the thickness of the gate structures within the pixel and is also non - uniform within the pixel .",
    "the time - averaged output therefore represents a mean pixel response , rather than the response at any given location within the pixel .",
    "thus the ccd response consists of various parameters which are difficult to measure separately .",
    "we have therefore developed the mesh technique in order to measure the response ( pixel structure ) of ccds with sub - pixel resolution .",
    "this technique has been previously applied to the ccds @xcite employed in the xmm / newton observatory by tsunemi et al@xcite . in this paper , we report on measurements of the sub - pixel structure of the epic mos ccd with substantially improved spatial resolution .",
    "the xmm / newton satellite was developed by the european space agency ( esa ) which comprises a membership of 13 european countries . it was launched into a relatively high - earth orbit in december , 1999 . among its instruments are the 3 epic imaging spectrometers , which reside in the focal plane , at the foci of the three mirror modules .",
    "all carry silicon ccd detectors .",
    "one of the cameras utilizes back - illuminated pn ccds with 150@xmath0 m square pixels and was developed at the max plank institute  @xcite .",
    "the other two cameras carry mos ccds(eev ccd 22s ) which were developed primarily by the x - ray astronomy group at leicester university and marconi applied technologies ( formerly eev ) in the united kingdom  @xcite .",
    "the epic mos ccd is a frame transfer , front - illuminated device .",
    "the epic mos ccd is a three phase device .",
    "the electrodes , or gates ( poly1 , poly2 and poly3 ) are shown schematically in figure[1pix_struct ] .",
    "the thickness of depletion region is approximately 37@xmath0 m with nominal clock voltages and substrate bias @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the epic mos ccd is its open electrode structure . in order to improve the detection efficiency at low energies , one of the gates , poly3 ,",
    "has been enlarged by partially removing the front face , leaving two holes  in each pixel .",
    "these holes cover 40% of the pixel area and are separated by a central electrode finger  comprising polysilicon , oxide and nitride layers .",
    "a p - plus dopant is implanted in the etched areas , which pins the surface potential to the substrate potential .",
    "a detailed explanation of our mesh experiments may be found in the literature @xcite@xcite . figure  [ consept ] gives a schematic view of the mesh experiment .",
    "the mesh experiment consists of a ccd , a metal mesh and a pseudo parallel x - ray beam .",
    "the metal mesh employed has periodically spaced holes which are much smaller than the pixel size .",
    "the hole spacing is an integer multiple of the ccd pixel size .",
    "the mesh is placed just above the ccd surface , as close to the ccd as practically possible .",
    "the mesh must have an orientation which is slightly rotated with respect to the ccd so that the shadow of the mesh hole on the ccd gradually shifts its position inside the pixel as shown in fig . [ consept ] . in this way , over the ccd dimensions , the x - rays passing through the mesh holes periodically sample the entire pixel .",
    "this produces a moire pattern from which the relative alignment between the mesh and the ccd may be determined  @xcite .",
    "an x - ray event detected by the ccd must have come through one of the mesh holes . taking into account the hole spacing and the pixel size , we can unequivocally determine the hole location for individual x - ray events",
    ". we can therefore calculate the x - ray interaction position within the ccd with sub - pixel resolution .",
    "the accuracy is limited by the effective mesh hole size which is slightly bigger than the geometrical shape of the hole due to diffraction .",
    "the experiment was performed in a ccd test facility at leicester university .",
    "the eev ccd 22 has 600@xmath1600 pixels with each pixel being 40@xmath0 m square .",
    "a gold mesh was employed which has a thickness of 10@xmath0 m and small holes of 2@xmath0 m diameter .",
    "the spacing between the holes was 120@xmath0 m ; just three times the pixel size .",
    "we placed the mesh about 0.5 mm above the ccd surface and rotated it by about 1.@xmath27 from the ccd . the x - ray generator manufactured by kevex inc .",
    "was approximately 3 m from the ccd and several fluorescence targets were used , generating characteristic x - rays as well as a bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "figure[spec_all ] gives an example the spectrum obtained by the mesh experiment using a ag target with a voltage of 5kv .",
    "there are several characteristic emission lines , o - k ( 0.52kev ) , al - k ( 1.5kev ) , si - k ( 1.8kev ) and ag - l(2.9kev ) , superposed on a continuum extending up to 5kev .",
    "the ccd operating conditions were almost identical to those employed on the xmm / newton satellite . during frame integration",
    "we apply 8v ( high voltage ) to poly3 ( in fig.[1pix_struct ] ) only .",
    "the other two gates remained un - biased .",
    "the ccd chip was cooled to @xmath3100@xmath4c using liquid nitrogen and was driven using duplicate flight electronics .",
    "tsunemi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) performed the mesh experiments using a similar experimental setup  @xcite .",
    "their experiment used an existing copper mesh with a thickness of 10@xmath0 m and holes of 4@xmath0 m diameter .",
    "the spacing between the holes was 48@xmath0 m which is not a multiple of the pixel size .",
    "the effective mesh hole at that time was 7@xmath0 m in diameter .",
    "for this experiment , we have improved the conditions by fabricating a new mesh which may be positioned much closer to the ccd surface with holes 2@xmath0 m in diameter . in the new configuration",
    ", the effective mesh hole gives about a factor of 3 improvement in spatial resolution over the previous experiment .",
    "furtheremore , the hole spacing is much greater , and is an integer multiple of the pixel size , which makes the determination of the x - ray interaction location within a given pixel much clearer .",
    "the mesh technique allows us to determine the x - ray interaction position within the ccd pixel .",
    "furthermore , it samples the entire pixel which enables us to restore the pixel images for the various x - ray energies as well as the various x - ray event - types . in the data analysis",
    ", we pick out the characteristic x - ray energies thanks to their good statistics ( as summarized in table  [ eev_exp ] in order of attenuation length in sio@xmath5 ) . we then construct restored images for various x - ray event - types ; ( a ) single pixel events , ( b ) vertically split events , ( c ) horizontally split events and ( d ) all x - ray events , as shown in figure  [ restored ] . in this figure",
    ", each image represents 2@xmath12 pixels of the ccd , with the dashed square corresponding to the pixel size of 40@xmath0 m square .",
    "brighter regions correspond to a higher detection efficiency .",
    "looking at the pixel image restored using all x - ray events ( the right hand column ) , we can clearly see absorption features within the pixel .",
    "in particular , the two etched regions in each pixel are clearly visible in the o - k image , since o - k has the shortest attenuation length of the x - ray energies employed . moving to greater attenuation lengths",
    ", the etched region becomes less obvious .",
    "it is difficult to see the enhanced region in the ag - l image which is almost free from absorption within the gate structure .    in the restored image using single pixel events , we clearly see the enhanced region only in the o - k image .",
    "other than the gate structure , we notice that there are three regions in each pixel : the regions generating single pixel events , vertically split events and horizontally split events .",
    "split events are generated in the regions within the pixel where the charge cloud splits into adjacent pixels .",
    "we can clearly see that the horizontal pixel boundary ( giving rise to vertically split events ) is not a straight line but is instead a wavy line .",
    "in contrast to this , the vertical pixel boundary is governed by the channel stops , which include a p - plus implant in order to make an electric potential barrier which results in a normal ( i.e. straight line ) shape for the pixel boundary .",
    "there are small gaps in the region generating horizontally split events .",
    "these correspond to the pixel corners where the 3- or 4-pixel events are generated .",
    "the wavy boundary is due to the fact that the poly3 gate is etched so that it has a finger structure as shown in fig.[1pix_struct ] . in other words",
    ", the potential generated by poly3 during integration defines a wavy boundary between adjacent pixels rather than a straight line .",
    "the shape of the region generating vertically split events also depends on the attenuation length of the x - rays indicating the depth dependence of the electric field inside the ccd .",
    "it can be compared with that expected from the model calculation .      in the mesh experiment",
    ", we can identify both the energy and the interaction position within the pixel for an individual x - ray photon .",
    "we can therefore extract x - ray spectra from any region within the pixel .",
    "we selected five regions within the pixel in order to measure the pixel structure of the ccd .",
    "these are labeled in figure  [ spec_region ] as finger , channel stop , electrode , open electrode 1 and open electrode 2 , respectively . among them , the channel stop and the finger are so narrow that the selected regions partially overlap with the open electrode region due to the finite spatial resolution of the experiment .",
    "figure  [ regspec ] shows the spectra for each region using the same data in fig .",
    "[ spec_all ] .",
    "we first compared spectra for the open electrode 1 and 2 .",
    "we confirmed that the ratio shown in figure  [ open ] is almost constant and independent of energy .",
    "because these two regions must show the highest efficiency at low energies , we added them together to generate a standard spectrum for the open electrode with which we compare other data . figure  [ trans ] shows the ratio between the spectra for the open electrode and those for other three regions : upper panel , middle panel and lower panel are results of electrodes , finger and channel stop , respectively . since these figures represent the extra absorption features in each region , we fitted them with a relatively simple absorption model .",
    "the model contains a normalization , a constant component and absorption features for si and sio@xmath5 .",
    "the normalization is required due to the difference in area of each region and the constant comes from the area of overlap with the open electrode region . in this way , we obtained the thickness of si and sio@xmath5 for each region .",
    "the best fit results are shown in fig .",
    "[ trans ] by solid lines and summarized in table  [ result ] .      in june 1999 the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) was launched into a a high - earth orbit , similar to that of the xmm / newton satellite .",
    "it is equipped with a ccd camera ( acis ) consisting of ten ccd chips : eight front - illuminated(fi ) ccds and two back - illuminated(bi ) ccds . in august",
    ", it was reported that a substantial degradation of the ccd had occurred  @xcite .",
    "the degree of the degradation is worse than that for the asca ccds , despite that asca has been in a low - earth orbit since february , 1993 .",
    "it should be noted that the fi ccds are heavily damaged while the bi ccds are free from damage .",
    "it was concluded that the degradation was due to a relatively high flux of low energy ( @xmath6 kev ) protons .",
    "the interpretation is that the low energy protons are collected onto the ccd and penetrate the relatively thin electrode structure leaving traps near the charge transfer channel .",
    "the charge transfer channel is a relatively narrow path inside the pixel that is localized as a notch  structure  @xcite .",
    "the effective thickness of the electrode structure above the charge transfer channel is directly measured by the mesh experiment and found to be @xmath7 m thick si and @xmath7 m thick sio@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high flux of low energy protons penetrates this structure and causes permanent damage on the buried channel of the ccd . in the case of the bi ccd ,",
    "the charge transfer channel is relatively far away from the entrance side , resulting in no damage to these ccds .",
    "the epic mos ccd has a complicated electrode structure .",
    "the effective thickness of the absorber above the open electrode structure is designed to be @xmath8 m thick sio@xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that low energy protons will easily generate traps under the open electrode structure .",
    "however , the charge transfer channel is just under the finger structure .",
    "our measurements indicate that the finger structure consists of @xmath9 m thick si and @xmath10 m thick sio@xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that the charge transfer channel of the epic mos ccd is better protected than that of the acis ccd .",
    "we can say that the epic - mos ccd is more radiation hard than the fi chip of the acis .",
    "the details on the radiation hardness requires more quantitative measurement .",
    "x - ray events detected by a ccd are classified by the number of pixels over which the resultant charge splits . due to readout noise and",
    "charge loss around the charge cloud perimeter , single pixel events generally give the best energy resolution .",
    "one of the main features of this ccd is its open electrode region where the low energy efficiency is enhanced .",
    "we must therefore endeavour to control the operating conditions so that we can increase the active region generating single pixel events in the open electrode .",
    "[ restored ] clearly shows that vertically split events are generated primarily in the open electrode .",
    "furthermore , the shape of this region depends on the attenuation length of the photon in si .",
    "this must be due to the interaction of the applied voltages on neighbouring electrodes . in the standard mode ,",
    "poly3 is biased during integration while the other two electrodes are not .",
    "we performed an experiment in which we biased both poly3 and poly1 during integration .",
    "figure  [ rest2 ] shows the restored images for mo - l(2.3kev ) x - ray events again classified by x - ray event - type as in fig .  [",
    "restored ] .",
    "it is clear that the horizontal pixel boundary for vertically split events has been changed .",
    "we have not yet been able to determine which working condition is the best for spectroscopic study .",
    "this will require further study , taking into account the effect of the thickness of the depletion region .    in the mesh experiment , we can study how the primary charge behaves inside the ccd  @xcite . in some pixel regions ,",
    "when the primary charge is photoabsorbed close to the front surface of the device , it produces a tail in the spectrum .",
    "this effect is more evident for low energy x - rays since they have a shorter attenuation length in si . in particular",
    ", the response of the o - k line shows a strong dependence on the interaction position within the pixel . in our experiment",
    ", the incident x - ray spectrum contains several emission lines as well as a relatively strong continuum which prevents us from studying in detail any tail to the response function . in order to study this",
    ", we require a mono - energetic x - ray beam .",
    "the present experimental setup does not currently permit us to generate such mono - energetic x - ray beams with sufficient flux to conduct the mesh experiment .",
    "we calculated the meadn pixel response that is shown in figure  [ eff ] with taking into acount our results of each structre within the pixel;open - electrodes , electrodes , finger and channel stop .",
    "it was calcurated with parameters measured from the mesh experiment as described in table  [ result ] weighted with area fractions of each structure . in this calculation",
    ", we assumed that there is an extra absorption of @xmath8 m thick sio@xmath5 and si@xmath11n@xmath12 over the pixel since we can not measure the absorption on the open electrode region .",
    "these extra absorption play an important role of the absorption feature at the low energy region .",
    "we also assume that the depletion region is 37@xmath0 m  @xcite thick that plays an important role at the high energy region .",
    "we compared our result with that reported by c.  pigiot et al .",
    "1999  @xcite which performed the ground caribrations of epic mos ccd using mono - energetic x - ray beam at osay synchrotron facility in france .",
    "we found that our estimation has a good agreement with the data points of thier ground calibration .",
    "we performed a mesh experiment on a ccd ccd identical to that employed in the epic mos imaging spectrometers on - board xmm / newton .",
    "we were able to obtain restored x - ray images with sub - pixel resolution using x - ray photons of characteristic emission lines : o - k , y - l , mo - l , al - k and ag - l .",
    "all the x - ray events are classified by their event - types : single pixel event , horizontally split event , vertically split event and all events .",
    "there are clear absorption features inside the pixel including electrodes , channel stops etc . the shorter the attenuation length in sio@xmath5 , the clearer these absorption features become .",
    "we also confirmed that the horizontal pixel boundary between vertically split events is not a straight line , but is wavy .",
    "the specific shape of this wavy line depends on the attenuation length of the x - ray photons in silicon .",
    "this indicates the depth dependence of the electric field inside the ccd .",
    "we obtained spectra from various regions within a ccd pixel , which showed a non - uniformity of the detection efficiency .",
    "we selected five regions from which we extracted spectra .",
    "we then compared the spectrum from the open electrode region with the other regions in order to measure the absorption features in detail .",
    "the electrode structure comprises 0.29 @xmath13 m of si and 0.94 @xmath14 m of sio@xmath5 while the electrode finger comprises 0.15 @xmath14 m of si and 0.73 @xmath15 m of sio@xmath5 .",
    "the effective absorption at the channel stop is equivalent to 0.57 @xmath16 m of sio@xmath5 .",
    "the charge transfer channel is a relatively narrow path within the pixel;just below the electrode finger in the case of epic mos ccd .",
    "we found that the extra absorption feature above the charge transfer channel of epic mos ccd is thicker than that of the fi ccd of acis(@xmath170.3@xmath0 m of si and sio@xmath5 ) on - board the cxo whose orbit is similar to that of xmm / newton .",
    "for the acis ccd , it was reported that fi ccds got permanent damages on the buried channel due to a relatively high flux of low energy protons .",
    "our measurement indicates that the epic mos ccd is more radiation hard than the fi ccd of the acis .    in the standard working condition of the ccd ,",
    "the vertically split events are generated mainly in the open electrode region where the detection efficiency at low energies is enhanced . since single pixel events usually give better energy resolution than split pixel events , it is preferable to generate more single events and less split events in the open electrode region .",
    "we confirmed that the shape of the region generating the vertically split event varies by changing the operation mode .",
    "we can therefore control the ccd so that the open electrode region generates more single pixel events rather than split events ."
