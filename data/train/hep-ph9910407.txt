    "several experiments sensitive to solar neutrinos have measured a @xmath0 flux , with results lower than the values predicted by standard solar models ( ssm ) for different neutrino energies : the homestake cl radiochemical experiment @xcite , with sensitivity down to the lower part of the @xmath1b spectrum and the @xmath2be line , the two radiochemical @xmath3ga experiments , gallex@xcite and sage@xcite , which are sensitive to the low energy pp neutrinos and above , and the water crenkov experiments , kamiokande@xcite and superkamiokande ( sk)@xcite , which can observe only the highest energy @xmath4b neutrinos . a combination of any two of the experiments disfavors an astrophysical solution to the problem , and seems to indicate that a non - standard physical process is modifying the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos .",
    "a widely accepted explanation of the discrepancy is based on the assumption that nondegenerate massive neutrinos do undergo flavor oscillations , either in vacuum or within the sun ( msw effect ) @xcite .",
    "another less orthodox mechanism for neutrino oscillations , which does not need neutrinos to have a mass , was proposed several years ago @xcite and requires the coupling of neutrinos to gravity to be flavor dependent , i.e. , a violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) in the neutrino sector .",
    "some phenomenological consequences of this mechanism have been examined in a number of papers@xcite .    in a recent work @xcite we developed a generalized vep mechanism for neutrino oscillations , which is based on an extended parametrized post - newtonian formalism ( ppn ) . here",
    "we apply this approach to the concrete situation of solar neutrinos , and in particular to the analysis of the seasonal variation of the signal . using the latest data on total rates from the five experiments , and those on the energy spectrum and the seasonal variations from sk , we determine the allowed regions and the best - fits values for the oscillation parameters .",
    "we show that a solution to the solar neutrino problem is possible within the vep scheme , not only for msw matter - enhanced transformations but also for vacuum oscillations .    in the solar system the gravitational field receives contributions from several sources .",
    "assuming , as is commonly done , that the potential vanishes at an infinite distance from the source , the dominant contribution is given by the great attractor , with small perturbations produced by galactic clusters , our galaxy , and the sun .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to approximate the potential by a constant of the order of @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the effect of this potential regarding a possible vep mechanism has already been analyzed by halprin , leung , and pantaleone @xcite .",
    "here we follow the more general approach of ref.@xcite , which incorporates not only a possible flavor dependence of the gravitational couplings , but also the most general violations to einstein gravity in the context of metric theories . in this approach , the metric is given by the minkowskian one plus source dependent perturbations : @xmath6 .",
    "the assumptions for constructing the metric in the ppn formalism involve virialized sources such that @xmath7 , where the quantities @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represent estimations of the order of magnitude of the mass , distance and characteristic velocity of the source . in what follows",
    "we keep only first order corrections to the flat space - time metric @xmath10 , and we neglect a possible angular momentum of the great attractor , which in any case would lead to very small corrections .",
    "thus we have @xmath11 , while the non - null corrections are given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are adimensional parameters of the ppn expansion ( up to order @xmath16 ) .",
    "in the particular case of einstein gravity we have @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the potentials responsible for the metric perturbations are @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the mass density of the source of the gravitational field .",
    "we are using a system of unities with @xmath21 .",
    "for a confined and distant source , @xmath22 can be approximated by @xmath23 if we take the z - axis along the direction determined by the solar system and the gravitational source , we then have @xmath24 . however , the components @xmath25 and @xmath26 are proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angular size of the source , while @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "since the great attractor is a rather extended object with an angular size of the order of @xmath33@xcite , in the case of the solar system there are only three relevant types of @xmath34 contributions : ( i ) those coming from our galaxy , which are of order @xmath35 , ( ii ) a longitudinal component from the great attractor , of order @xmath36 , and ( iii ) transverse - longitudinal components also produced by the great attractor , of the same order as the galactic contributions , @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , possible vep flavor oscillations of solar neutrinos would be characterized by three main effects : an isotropic effect ( @xmath38 ) , and two anisotropic effects ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) . in the next section we review the essential ingredients of the vep mechanism for neutrino oscillations within the context of the ppn formalism , and in section iii",
    "we apply it to the study of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "for simplicity , in what follows we consider that there are only two ( massless ) neutrino flavors , @xmath0 and @xmath41 . in our vep scenario",
    "they are assumed to be linear superpositions of the gravitational eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with a mixing angle @xmath44 .",
    "each gravitational eigenstate is characterized by a different set of ppn parameters , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this leads to different dispersion relations for the @xmath47 , which can be approximated by@xcite @xmath48 \\ , .",
    "\\label{dispersion}\\ ] ]    suppose that the initial state produced at time @xmath49 corresponds to a pure electron neutrino . then , for a constant gravitational field the survival probability after traveling a distance @xmath50 is @xmath51 according to this , neutrino oscillations will appear whenever a non null mixing is generated because of flavor dependent gravitational interactions .",
    "these oscillations have a characteristic length given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 ,   \\label{delta0}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the neutrino beam energy , and @xmath55 in contrast to the ordinary vacuum oscillations induced by a mass difference , where @xmath56 is proportional to the energy , the effect we are considering here has an oscillation length that goes with @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to observable distinctions between both mechanisms and makes the gravitational induced oscillations suitable to be observed with higher energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "note that even though the overall sign of the gravitational potential is irrelevant for oscillations , the relative signs among differences of the ppn parameters are very significant .",
    "if we assume that these differences are all of the same order , then the most important directional effect would be given by the quadrupolar contribution corresponding to @xmath58 .    as is well known , flavor transformations of massive neutrinos are affected by their interactions with matter @xcite .",
    "neutral current interactions are flavor diagonal and can be ignored , as long as we do not consider sterile neutrinos and neutrinos are not part of the medium @xcite , but this is not true for the charged current interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "the forward scattering amplitude is not flavor diagonal and depends on the leptonic content of the matter , which gives place to important consequences such as the msw effect .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens for the vep mechanism in the presence of matter . in this case",
    ", the flavor evolution for relativistic neutrinos propagating through a constant gravitational field is governed by the equation @xmath59 where the hamiltonian @xmath60 , after discarding an irrelevant overall phase , can be written as @xmath61 the first term arises from vep and the second term accounts for the matter effects on the neutrino propagation . for a normal matter background , as in the case of the sun",
    ", we have @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fermi constant and @xmath64 denotes the electron number density . an extended gravity like the one here considered",
    "could also affect the electroweak lagrangian , but the combined effect should be of the order @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , they are strongly suppressed and we do not include them in our discussion .    taking into account the dominant contributions due to @xmath22 and @xmath66 , the coefficient @xmath67 reduces to @xmath68 . \\label{delta1}\\ ] ] here , @xmath69 is the right ascension of the sun , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the right ascension and declination of the great attractor in ecliptic coordinates .",
    "the second term in @xmath67 arises from the quadrupolar potential of the gravitational source and generates a seasonal dependence in the oscillation wavelength , as first discussed in ref .",
    "this effect went unnoticed in previous work on the subject @xcite , where only the contribution coming from the newtonian gravitational potential was considered . to isolate the anisotropic contribution",
    ", it is convenient to reparametrize @xmath67 as follows @xmath72    \\label{delta2}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so that the annual average of @xmath67 is independent of @xmath75 .",
    "we will define @xmath75 positive , because ( @xmath76 @xmath70 ) is equivalent to ( @xmath77 @xmath78 ) .    at any time",
    ", @xmath60 can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation characterized by an angle @xmath79 @xmath80 there exists a resonant flavor conversion when the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian vanish , i.e. , when @xmath81 and in this case the mixing in matter is maximal ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the efficiency of the conversion mechanism depends on the adiabaticity of the process . for a constant gravitational field ,",
    "the average probability for a @xmath0 produced in the sun to reach the earth reads @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath85 represents the probability of transition between the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath60 .",
    "it embodies the total correction to the adiabatic result for @xmath86 , which corresponds to @xmath87 .    except for regions close to the center and the surface , the electron density in the sun",
    "is well approximated by an exponential profile @xcite .",

    ", @xmath85 is exponentially small . on the other hand , when @xmath100 there are considerable corrections to the adiabatic approximation that reduces the magnitude of the resonant transformation .",
    "nonadiabatic effects become important when @xmath96 is of order 1 , provided that the neutrinos go through a resonance .",
    "if @xmath101 , level crossing can not occur , @xmath87 and neutrino propagation will be adiabatic even for @xmath100 .",
    "an effective way to account for this situation is to multiply the expression of eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) by the step function @xmath102 , so that the transition probability vanishes when neutrinos are produced below the resonance .",
    "the msw survival probability @xmath86 , averaged on the production region for the @xmath103b neutrinos , is plotted in fig . 1 as a function of @xmath67 for different mixing angles .",
    "these curves have been obtained using the electron density predicted by the ssm@xcite .",

    "an improved time resolution is necessary in order to discriminate between the different periodic behaviors .",
    "the most restrictive conditions arise from the energy spectrum . in this case , the small - angle msw solution is clearly ruled out by the sk data whereas the vacuum vep oscillations are favored .",
    "the msw oscillations with large mixing angle also remain as a possible solution .",
    "more accurate data are necessary to properly establish the viability of the vep mechanism as an adequate explanation of the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "however , the present analysis is sufficient to set new boundaries on the ppn coefficients that parametrize the violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "an improved resolution in the spectral measurements is required to establish the existence of a six - month period variation in the @xmath157 neutrino flux , which is a signature of the vep mechanism and makes a clear difference with other possible solutions , such as the standard vacuum oscillations of massive neutrinos@xcite .",
