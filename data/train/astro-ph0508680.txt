    "our knowledge of the chemical evolution of the universe has improved dramatically in the last years as the result of the high precision data gathered on local and high redshift galaxies and on the interstellar and intergalactic media . in particular , estimates of the evolution of the well - known local luminosity - metallicity relation suggest a change in the zero point and slope so that at a given metallicity , systems are brighter in the past @xcite .",
    "lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) first claimed that the fundamental relation was actually between stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "recently , tremonti et al . ( 2004 ) confirmed the existence of the stellar mass - metallicity relation ( mmr ) on statistical basis for a sample of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "these authors detected a change in the slope of this relation at a stellar mass similar to the characteristic mass defined by kauffmann et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that the steeper slope found in this relation for smaller stellar masses was the result of the action of galactic winds .",
    "recently , gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that stellar mass is not the fundamental parameter determining age or metallicity based on the large dispersions found in their data .",
    "the physical origin of both the luminosity - metallicity and the mass - metallicity relations , their interconnection and evolution are fundamental problems for models of galaxy formation .    high precision , large - scale cosmological observations provide strong support for @xmath1cdm models . in this scenario , galaxies form by the hierarchical aggregation of substructure .",
    "hence , mergers and interactions as well as continuous gas inflows play a crucial role in the history of evolution of galaxies , affecting the mass distributions and star formation rates , and as a consequence , the chemical properties of the systems . in order to study galaxy formation and to provide a consistent concatenation and interpretation of observational results ,",
    "sophisticated models which can follow the hierarchical building up of the structure together with the evolution of their chemical properties are needed .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical models which include chemical production are a powerful tool to tackle this problem as it has been previously shown by mosconi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and lia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , among others .",
    "the main goal of this work is to discuss the direct relation between the dynamical evolution and chemical properties of galactic systems in a hierarchical clustering scenario , in order to provide clues on the origin of the fundamental metallicity relations of galaxies .",
    "note that this paper is focused on the study of systems with stellar masses larger than @xmath5 .",
    "hence , results may not be relevant for dwarf galaxies , where sn are expected to play a more important role although we do not include a strong supernova ( sn ) energy feedback in this paper , we discuss its potential action on the results .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the numerical simulations , the methodology applied to estimate the chemical and astrophysical properties of galactic systems and the findings .",
    "section 4 summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "we have run cosmological hydrodynamical simulations which describe the evolution of dark matter and baryons in a @xmath1cdm scenario ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) including metal - dependent radiative cooling , star formation and chemical enrichment by supernovae ii and ia .",
    "the chemical algorithms have been developed within the code gadget-2 in its fully conservative version @xcite .",
    "the simulation corresponds to a @xmath9 side cubic volume resolved with initially @xmath10 particles , implying a mass resolution of @xmath11 h@xmath12 and @xmath13 for the dark matter and gas , respectively .",
    "we have assumed an instantaneous thermalization of the supernova ( sn ) energy .",
    "virialized structures are identified at different redshifts by using a combination of a friends - of - friends technique and a contrast density criterium ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the dynamical and mean chemical properties of these systems , as well as their star formation histories , are estimated taking into account the mass within the optical radius , defined as the one that encloses @xmath15 of the baryonic mass .",
    "since these simulations follow the chemical enrichment by individual elements , we can directly estimate abundance indicators such as @xmath16 .",
    "we have chosen to work with mass - weighted abundances since they reflect more reliably the chemical enrichment of the system as a whole .",
    "caution should be taken when comparing these abundances with observations that provide information only on certain regions of galaxies such as hii regions .",
    "we have constructed the stellar mass - metallicity relation and the circular velocity - metallicity relation for galactic systems at different redshifts .",
    "the circular velocities ( @xmath17 ) are measured at the optical radius . for the gas component",
    ", we find that the scatter in the relations is much larger and their evolution is not that clearly defined , although the gas follows the same general trends defined by stars ( see de rossi et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "for that reason , in this letter we estimate the metallicities from the simulated stellar populations .    in fig .",
    "[ zmoh ] we show the mmr estimated for the galactic systems at @xmath4 , renormalized by 0.25 dex to match the zero point of the observed relation given by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ; shaded areas ) .",
    "we note that this displacement is not needed for the gas component which is always more enriched than the overall stellar population .",
    "however , we would also like to point out that the metallicities corresponding to the sdss have been obtained from the central regions of galaxies which are expected to be more metal - rich . as it can be seen from this figure ,",
    "a linear regression fit is not a good representation of the simulated relation .",
    "however , the simulated mmr is in agreement with the trend estimated from the sdss , although there is some excess of metals at the lower mass end .    in fig .",
    "[ zmstar ] we show the stellar mass - metallicity relation for galactic systems at different redshifts .",
    "we can appreciate that the mmrs behave in a similar fashion from @xmath18 to the present time . as it can be seen from this figure",
    ", there is a change in the curvature at @xmath19 which corresponds to an abundance of @xmath20 .",
    "this characteristic mass has been estimated by determining the stellar mass where the linear fit is no longer a good representation of the simulated data .",
    "this has been achieved by the analysis of the residuals of these relations .",
    "we estimated the stellar mass at which the residuals show a behaviour which departures from that expected for a good linear fit . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3new ] , for @xmath21 , the residuals start to be systematically negative indicating a saturation of the metallicity as a function of stellar mass . for all analysed redshifts , the relations determined by the systems with stellar masses greater than @xmath22 tend to have a shallower slope , although the level of enrichment increases with redshift .",
    "conversely , systems with @xmath23 show a steeper correlation between metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ zmstar ] denote the statistical dispersion of the abundances in each bin .",
    "these dispersions show a larger scatter in oxygen abundances for @xmath24 which suggest that the histories of evolution of these systems are more different among each other than those of the systems at the massive end ( a similar trend is found by binning in mass intervals with equal number of members ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of the mmr relation indicates an increase with time of the chemical content of the systems , with the major changes driven by the smaller ones which , on average , are enriched by up to @xmath25 dex from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this behaviour is responsible of a general flattening of the slope in this mass range .",
    "systems with @xmath26 show less evolution in their chemical content with a @xmath270.05 dex variation from @xmath18 to @xmath4 .",
    "the characteristic mass remains almost unchanged with redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig3new ] ) while its corresponding oxygen abundance increases only by 0.05 dex in the same redshift range .",
    "the different histories of evolution of the systems may be determining the dependence of the metallicity evolution and dispersions on stellar mass . in order to investigate this point",
    ", we estimated the time ( @xmath28 ) when @xmath29 of the total stellar mass at @xmath4 was already formed for each galactic system .",
    "this time @xmath28 is defined by the particular evolutionary history of each galactic system .",
    "as expected , we found that objects with @xmath26 have older stellar populations with a variation of up to @xmath30 in @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , the stellar populations of the smaller mass systems present a wider range of ages , leading to a change of more than @xmath31 in @xmath28 . hence , while most of the stellar content of massive systems is formed at higher redshift as expected in this kind of cosmological scenario , smaller systems constitute a diverse population .    in order to understand the physical meaning of the evolution of the mmr and the characteristic mass @xmath22 , we have analysed the merger trees of the simulated systems at @xmath4 and the relation between the dynamical and chemical properties of their progenitors at @xmath32 ( de rossi et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) . from the analysis of the merger histories we find that systems with @xmath33 transform their gas content into stars in a more passive fashion or via gas - rich mergers , setting a steeper correlation between stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "galaxies with masses larger than @xmath22 are formed by merger events which involve stellar dominated systems . in these cases ,",
    "the mergers produce a system with a final stellar mass equal to the sum of the old stars in the merging objects plus some new born ones , while its overall mean abundances remain at the same level of enrichment .",
    "this situation occurs because , in this case , the merging systems have already transformed most of their gas into stars so that there is no fuel for an important starburst during the merger",
    ". it could be also possible that a large system merges with a smaller less - enriched one which can feed new star formation activity but with lower level of enrichment .",
    "both scenarios have the same flattening effect on the slope of the mass - metallicity relation in systems within this range of masses .",
    "we also calculated the circular velocity -metallicity relation as shown in fig .",
    "we used the same mass intervals as in fig .",
    "[ zmstar ] in order to estimate the mean velocity of the corresponding galactic systems and their standard deviation in each mass interval .",
    "we can appreciate from this figure that , at a given redshift , the faster a system rotates , the higher its metallicity . at a given velocity ,",
    "the chemical evolution with redshift is larger than that obtained at a given stellar mass .",
    "this is because as one moves to lower redshift , more massive systems start to contribute to the lower circular velocity intervals . at high redshift ,",
    "galactic systems are more concentrated with less mass required to get to higher velocities .",
    "this reflects the fact that as the universe expands and its mean density decreases , galactic systems do not need to reach so high densities to form bounded structures .",
    "although the circular velocity determines a clear correlation , it shows larger evolution with time than the mmr .",
    "if the circular velocity of a system is known , the redshift of the systems is also needed to establish its metallicity , otherwise the dispersion could be as large as @xmath34 dex .    in the simulations analysed in this letter , we have not included a treatment of energy feedback , which is expected to produce powerful outflows , affecting the star formation process and the metal production and mixing .",
    "hence , the treatment of energy feedback may introduce changes in the metallicity properties .",
    "taking into account previous results ,",
    "sn feedback is expected to affect more strongly systems with circular velocities smaller than @xmath35 ( larson 1974 ) . in this case , only the smallest systems in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] would be significantly affected .",
    "note that the velocity corresponding to the characteristic mass varies from around @xmath36 at @xmath18 to @xmath37 at @xmath4 and consequently , it is unlikey that @xmath22 will be significantly modified either . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the strongest effects of energy feedback are expected to take place in the small mass range where we detect an excess of metals ( see fig  [ zmoh ] ) .",
    "the action of strong sn feedback would produce the ejection of part of the enriched material out of the systems and the decrease of the general level of enrichment .",
    "the need for sn outflows is also suggested by the analysis of the effective yields ( defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gas - phase metallicity and @xmath40 the gas fraction of the systems ) .",
    "the simulated @xmath41 values are lower than the solar yield expected in a closed box model , since our systems formed in a hierarchical scenario where mergers , interactions and infall affect the mass distribution and regulate star formation .",
    "contrary to observations ( e.g. garnett 2002 ) , we found slightly larger @xmath42 for systems with @xmath43 compared to those of the massive ones ( @xmath44 ) , which supports the claim for stronger sn outflows for the former . in the case of massive systems ,",
    "we get a mean of @xmath41 which remains approximately constant with optical velocity .",
    "although this latest result is in agreement with garnett ( 2002 ) , it might be indicating the need for some ejection of material also in massive systems in the light of the new observational findings of tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we have shown that galactic systems in the concordance @xmath1cdm model reproduce a stellar mass - metallicity relation in general agreement with that measured for galaxies in the sdss at @xmath45 , as a result of the particular evolution of galactic systems in this kind of scenarios .",
    "we acknowledge an excess of metals at the low mass end which could be solved by strong sn energy feedback .",
    "we found a stellar mass - metallicity relation well - defined from @xmath18 which evolves weakly with time .",
    "the largest change in the metal content is driven by the smaller mass systems .",
    "we have also determined a characteristic stellar mass ( corresponding to solar abundance ) so that for more massive systems , the mass - metallicity relation flattens and there is less evolution in their chemical enrichment level .",
    "this characteristic mass and its corresponding metallicity are robust against numerical resolution since approximately the same values are detected in experiments run with different number of particles , from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "the characteristic mass found from our simulations agrees with the one estimated from the sdss by kauffmann et al .",
    "this mass appears naturally as a result of the hierarchical building up of the structure and segregates two distinctive types of galactic systems .",
    "our findings show that systems with @xmath48 transform most of their gas into stars at higher redshifts and experience important merger events . at lower redshifts ,",
    "these mergers tend to involve systems dominated by stars so that while the final stellar mass of the outcoming system is larger , its mean stellar metallicity remains basically the same .",
    "this is because a small percentage of new stars are formed during the merger and , consequently , the final metallicity is determined by the old stars belonging to the incoming systems .",
    "smaller galactic objects form their stars in a more passive way or during gas - rich mergers . hence , in this case , there is a more steeper correlation between metallicity and stellar mass content .",
    "according to our results , in the absence of strong sn energy feedback , the stellar mass - metallicity relation is the parameter that better determines the metallicity of a galaxy with a weak dependence on redshift .",
    "conversely , at a given circular velocity , the combination of chemical enrichment and cosmology produces a larger evolution with lookback time .",
    "we found that the dispersions in both relations are produced by the combination of stars with different ages and metallicities which results from the particular dynamical history of evolution of a system in a hierarchical clustering scenario ."
