    "one of the biggest problems in particle physics is description of hadrons in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom  quarks and gluons .",
    "this is in fact a non - perturbative problem and usually is formulated in terms of various distribution functions , which appear in qcd factorization theorems .",
    "the most famous example are parton distribution functions which can be measured in the inclusive lepton - hadron deep inelastic processes .",
    "they are , however , one dimensional distributions only . therefore",
    "although they are by now sufficient for description of various processes at high energies , they simply give only limited information on the structure of hadrons .    on the other hand one can study also hard _ exclusive processes _ , such as deeply virtual compton scattering for instance .",
    "then the factorization theorem states , in great simplicity , that the amplitude is given by the convolution @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the part that can be calculated in perturbative qcd , while the @xmath2 part is of non - perturbative nature . in the following",
    "we will be mainly concentrated on the @xmath2 part .",
    "although difficult to access experimentally , they can be obtained either by lattice calculations or  as we shall see  they can be estimated from theoretically justified low energy effective models .",
    "the @xmath2 part parametrizes hadronic matrix elements of certain non - local operators on the light - cone .",
    "the simplest objects of this kind are distribution amplitudes ( da ) which correspond to hadron - to - vacuum matrix elements of bi - local quark operators on the light - cone . in case of the leading twist das , _",
    "i.e. _ the ones giving main contribution to the amplitude , they describe ( in the infinite momentum frame ) the probability for a composite particle to dissociate into its constituents with given longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "distribution amplitudes have been successfully used in theoretical description of hadronic form factors @xcite for many years .",
    "however recent babar data for pion - photon transition form factor shows , that probably the standard factorization formulae do not apply @xcite .",
    "we shall come back to the babar data in section [ sec : tda ] .",
    "more general class of @xmath2 objects are generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) .",
    "they correspond to non - diagonal in momenta matrix elements , therefore they describe also the distributions of transverse momenta of the partons inside the hadron . gpds appear in description of deeply virtual compton scattering for instance , which is recently the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies . for",
    "a review of this issue see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "one can still define more general class of the objects than gpds  so called transition distribution amplitudes ( tda ) .",
    "they parametrize matrix elements which are non - diagonal in momenta and in physical states .",
    "such a family of objects was introduced for the first time in @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss this class further in section [ sec : tda ] .    as already remarked above",
    "there is very little experimental data concerning the @xmath2 part of . on the other hand",
    "it can be studied in effective models .",
    "this is however nontrivial not only because of complex non - local interactions at low energies .",
    "even bigger problem is that in general effective models do not inherit all symmetries of the underlying theory .",
    "soft objects considered here appear in the framework of qcd , therefore they should posses several important properties , for example lorentz and gauge invariance .",
    "they should also correctly reproduce quantum anomalies .",
    "the task to cope with all the constrains in the effective models is therefore nontrivial .",
    "we shall come back to this point in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "let us consider the scattering process involving the simplest possible hadronic state  the pion . on one hand it is a bound state of quark - anti - quark pair and the goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry on the other .",
    "before we proceed let us briefly recall these very important aspects of qcd .    here and in the following we assume only two quarks @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are massless , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 .",
    "then the lagrangian of qcd is invariant under separate rotations of left- and right - handed spinors , that is the symmetry group is @xmath6 ( the chiral symmetry group ) .",
    "it is generated by the chiral charges satisfying @xmath7 commutation relations @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are pauli matrices , @xmath10 denote iso - doublets .",
    "one can also define the combination of chiral fields transforming as vector and axial - vector .",
    "then the corresponding combination of @xmath11 charges @xmath12 and @xmath13 generate the @xmath14 group is however broken due to quantum anomaly . ] .",
    "the most direct consequence of this symmetry would be a degeneracy of the states with different parity .",
    "however , such a behavior is not seen in the hadronic spectrum  on the contrary , we observe huge mass differences between parity partners . the most natural way of solving this discrepancy , is to postulate that although theory is chirally invariant , the vacuum state is not .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ spontaneous _ _ chiral symmetry breaking _ ( s@xmath15sb ) . according to goldstone theorem",
    "we should then observe a triplet of massless pseudo - scalar particles  the goldstone bosons .",
    "indeed they can be apparently identified with pions ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , which are very light ( @xmath19 ) in comparison to other hadrons ( e.g. @xmath20 ) .",
    "non - zero pion mass can be explained by finite ( although small ) current masses of @xmath21 quarks , which explicitly break chiral symmetry from the very beginning .",
    "another important aspect of s@xmath15sb is the existence of the quark condensates , _",
    "i.e. _ the quantities @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes either @xmath3 or @xmath4 quark field",
    ". it can be easily seen that the nonzero value of the quark condensate breaks chiral symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "consider the commutator@xmath24=-\\delta^{ab}\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\ ] ] and its vacuum expectation value .",
    "if the right hand side is nonzero it implies that@xmath25 what is exactly the s@xmath15sb condition . therefore the quark condensate can be viewed as an order parameter measuring the breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "phenomenological value of the quark condensate is quite large @xmath26 ( at renormalization scale about @xmath27 ) .",
    "let us notice next that in qcd @xmath28 is represented by a closed quark loop , _ i.e. _ it is proportional to the trace of fermionic propagator @xmath29 , where the trace is over dirac and color indices .",
    "however , if this quantity is non - zero there must be a non - slash term in the propagator  the mass term .",
    "this dynamically ( due to s@xmath15sb ) generated mass is often referred to as _",
    "constituent quark mass_. notice that the quark condensate is a purely non - perturbative quantity , since it is impossible to generate non - slash quark self energy by interactions of vector bosons .",
    "rather it must be created by some kind of a scalar interactions .",
    "we shall come back to the issue of quark condensate later in section [ sec : foton ] .",
    "let us now switch to description of the interactions between the pions and quarks at low energies .",
    "it is clear from the above that such a model must incorporate s@xmath15sb .",
    "it is convenient to start discussion by recalling the famous nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "it is an effective theory of quarks with four fermion couplings , appearing due to integrating out the gluonic degrees of freedom from the qcd action . in the standard njl model couplings with more",
    "fermions are neglected . the lagrange density for the simplest version of the njl model reads@xmath30,\\label{eq : njl}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are pauli matrices and @xmath32 is coupling constant .",
    "it can be checked using some algebra and the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 that lagrangian is indeed chirally invariant .",
    "the most important feature of njl model is that it incorporates the mechanism leading to s@xmath15sb .",
    "one way to see this is to solve the corresponding lowest order dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator .",
    "denoting quark self - energy by @xmath35 one obtains the following consistency condition ( so called gap equation)@xmath36 it has two solutions : @xmath37 ( for massless quarks ) and @xmath38 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the constituent quark mass which generates non - zero quark condensate breaking the chiral symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "notice that the integral in requires regularization .",
    "we shall discuss this later in this section . for",
    "a review of njl model see @xcite for example .",
    "mesons can be easily introduced into the just described theory as auxiliary fields @xmath39 and @xmath40  this can be done formally in the path integral formalism and is called bosonization procedure .",
    "the new lagrange density reads@xmath41\\psi+\\frac{\\mu^{2}}{2}\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\vec{\\pi}^{2}\\right),\\label{eq : semi_njl}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the fields @xmath43 are truly auxiliary - there are no corresponding kinetic terms , moreover they are composed fields what can be immediately seen using equations of motion .",
    "njl lagrangian in the form can also be used to show that the ground state which minimizes the energy is populated by the scalar quark condensate .",
    "one can also look at the appearance of mesonic fields from a slightly different point of view .",
    "consider the following effective lagrange density @xmath44 which leads to dirac equation for the quark with constituent quark mass @xmath45 .",
    "however is obviously not chirally invariant . in order to fix this deficiency one has to introduce additional fields in the form@xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pion weak decay constant , and couple them to quarks,@xmath48 then the axial transformations of quark fields can be absorbed by pion fields @xmath40 .",
    "the lagrange density is a starting point for our further considerations and represents the simplest _ local chiral quark model_. it describes quarks having dynamically generated constituent mass @xmath45 and interacting with the external pion fields .",
    "the effective theories just described are a non - renormalizable ones .",
    "the regularization introduced in order to make the loop integrals finite can not be removed at the very end of the calculations and the observables depend on its actual form .",
    "moreover it is somehow ( but not straightforwardly ) related to the domain of applicability of the model .",
    "there are many ways of regularizing the loop integrals .",
    "one could use for example simple four - momentum cutoff or pauli - villars regularization .",
    "however , the point is that the regularization scheme should respect all symmetries of the underlying theory , _",
    "i.e. _ qcd .",
    "this is extremely important especially in the case of soft matrix elements as stated in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "therefore four - momentum cutoff is excluded in the first place since it violates lorentz invariance .",
    "also very often used pauli - villars regularization is not the best method , because in order to get the results consistent with qcd one must keep it finite in some diagrams and remove in others ( connected with anomalous processes ) .",
    "on the other hand notice that in reality the constituent quark mass should not be a constant  it should vanish for large quark momenta due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "therefore in the following we assume that @xmath49 the constituent quark mass at zero momenta @xmath50 is chosen to be about @xmath51 .",
    "the interaction part of the effective action corresponding to with assumption can be written in momentum space as@xmath52 the explicit shape of @xmath53 can not be obtained from the gap equation itself .",
    "however the action was actually obtained in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum , together with the expression for @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath55 turns out to be a highly non - trivial function of euclidean momenta @xcite .",
    "therefore instead of @xmath55 we shall use the following simple formula in minkowski space @xcite @xmath56 which reproduces @xmath57 quite well when continued to euclidean space .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is responsible for the actual shape of @xmath53 , therefore we can investigate the sensitivity of calculated quantities to the form of the cutoff function .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath59 is adjusted in such a way that pion decay constant @xmath60 given by the formula @xcite@xmath61 is equal to the experimental value . in",
    "the above equation @xmath62 corresponds to euclidean momentum , while the prime to differentiation with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "for example for constituent quark mass @xmath64 and @xmath65 gives @xmath66 .",
    "although momentum dependent quark mass seems to be the most natural regulator it introduces a serious difficulty . namely ward - takahashi identities are not satisfied in such a model .",
    "it can be most easily seen by considering a divergence ( in momentum space ) of the vector current and applying dirac equation .",
    "this violation turns out to be not very large , it can however spoil some important properties of soft matrix elements , like correct normalization for example . in order to fix this problem",
    "the standard vector @xmath67 and axial @xmath68 vertices have to be modified by adding new non - local terms .",
    "the problem is , however , that such a modification is not unique @xcite ( ward identities fix only longitudinal part of the vertices ) . in this work we use the following modified vector and axial vertices : @xmath69 @xmath70 reproducing word - takahashi identities .",
    "the vector vertex does not introduce additional singularities , while the axial one has a pole corresponding to the massless pion as it should be @xcite .",
    "let us remark that eq .",
    "expressing @xmath60 is determined unambigously since it involves only the derivative of the axial current .    at the end of this section we remark that any non - local ( _ i.e. _ with momentum dependent constituent quark mass @xmath71 ) chiral quark model is determined by specifying both the @xmath71 and the precise form of all vertices .",
    "as already remarked in the introduction the simplest @xmath2 objects are distribution amplitudes . in this section",
    "we present how the non - local chiral quark model can be applied to this class . however , instead of considering the hadronic da we shall discuss less known photon da .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that  besides standard perturbative part  photons possess also hadronic component .",
    "this fact is very well known from photoproduction processes , where photon structure function has to be taken into account ( so called resolved photoproduction ) .",
    "photon das appear for example in the description of vector mesons radiative decays . to be more specific consider for instance the process @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : da1]a ) . using ope one",
    "can then write the amplitude as products of factors that are divergent on the light - cone and finite photon - to - vacuum matrix elements .",
    "the latter can be identified with the photon da as we shall see .    before we give the more precise definition of the photon da we should recall usefull kinematical variables .",
    "one defines two null vectors @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "then any four - vector @xmath75 can be decomposed into `` plus '' , `` minus '' and transverse components@xmath76    photon distribution amplitude is defined as a fourier transform of the photon - to - vacuum matrix element of the non - local quark operator on the light - cone . in general this can be written as@xmath77 where @xmath78 corresponds to different tensor nature of bilocal operators , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ,  @xmath81 _ _ denote apropriate tensor structures which are multiplied by photon da @xmath82 of given kinematical twist .",
    "notice that we do not assume that the photon is on - shell .",
    "then the decay constants @xmath83 depend on photon virtuality @xmath84 and become a kind of `` form factors ''  we shall use this terminology in the following . for more precise definitions of the photon das refer to @xcite .",
    "[ fig : da1 ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     we see that indeed the assumption of non - locality lowers the value of @xmath85 towards the experimental data .",
    "moreover @xmath86 is directly related to so called pion - photon transition form factor @xmath87 via the relation@xmath88 this quantity describes the pion decay @xmath89 process and was measured by cleo @xcite , cello @xcite and recently by babar @xcite collaborations .",
    "we compare our predictions to the experimental ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : tda3 ] .",
    "there is however important remark in order .",
    "notice , that by definition tdas are sensible only for small momentum transfers @xmath90 , the precise range of application is however not known .",
    "therefore , as an example we have chosen arbitrarliy the range of @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the new babar data are in disagreement with the standard qcd factorization formula , as it was already remarked in introduction . in qcd",
    ", the pion - photon form factor can be described using pion da and some perturbatively calculable factor , which leads to the certain asymptotic form .",
    "new babar data cover the range of @xmath92 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : tda3 ] we retained only the relevant low momentum data ) and cross the asymptotic line already at about @xmath93 .",
    "one way to resolve this discrepancy is to note that pion da which vanishes at the end - points was assumed in the standard factorization formula . in refs .",
    "@xcite the autors study the flat pion da in order to describe the new babar data ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "times momentum transfer @xmath90 .",
    "the shaded area represents the predictions from the non - local chiral quark model predictions for sensible model parameters .",
    "we get the best description of the low momentum tranfer data for @xmath94.,width=283 ]",
    "let us briefly summarize our presentation . in the begining we recalled chiral quark models , starting from widely known nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "we argued that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is their main ingredient .",
    "we also showed that they lead to nonzero quark condensates and in turn to dynamically generated constituent quark mass , which in general can depend on momentum .",
    "next we used a simple ansatz for this dependence and applied the model to two low - energy objects : photon distribution amplitude and photon - pion transition distribution amplitude .",
    "we find that they fulfil most symmetries required by qcd , provided we modify the vector and axial vertices in such a way that relevant currents are conserved .",
    "we find also that form factors which are calculated using transition distribution amplitudes are realistic when compared to the experimental data .    at the end",
    "we draw attention to important issues which was not covered by this presentation .",
    "first of all , in qcd all the low - energy quantities depend on some factorization scale @xmath95 and are a subject for corresponding qcd evolution . on the other hand , within effective models they are obtained at some fixed @xmath95 , which is in fact unknown (",
    "although can be roughly estimated ) . therefore before one makes a real use of them",
    "the evolution has to be applied .",
    "the second remark is rather a technical one and concerns the cutoff @xmath96 parameter in .",
    "one should not confuse it with the scale @xmath95 of the model , as discussed in @xcite .",
