    "all known low mass black hole binaries ( lmbhbs ) and several low mass neutron star binaries ( lmnsbs ) are transient ( see e.g. tanaka & lewin 1995 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 , white , nagase & parmar 1995 ) .",
    "these systems are also known as ` soft x - ray transients ' or sxts . in both lmbhbs and lmnsbs , a low mass secondary star ( main sequence or sub - giant ) transfers mass by roche - lobe overflow to the compact primary .",
    "the transfered matter flows on to the primary via an accretion disk .    for effective temperatures between about 5000  k and 8000  k , accretion disks described by the ` @xmath2 - viscosity ' prescription",
    "are thermally and viscously unstable due to large changes in the opacity as a result of hydrogen recombination .",
    "this instability is believed to trigger outbursts of dwarf novae .",
    "a dwarf nova is a cataclysmic binary ( cb ) system ( warner 1995 ) in which a white dwarf accretes from a low - mass companion at a mass accretion rate such that a steady disk would , at least over some range of radius , have an effective temperature in the thermally unstable range 50008000  k. since a steady disk is not allowed , the system undergoes a limit cycle where for some of the time ( i.e during outburst ) the mass accretion rate is high and the disk is entirely in a hot state with @xmath3  k , and for the rest of the time ( during quiescence ) the accretion rate is low and the entire disk is in a cold state with @xmath4  k.    the disk instability model ( dim ; see cannizzo 1993 for a review and hameury et al .",
    "1998 for a recent version of the model ) describes well the principal properties of dwarf novae .",
    "however , in its simplest version , the model can not account for the variety of observed behaviors ( e.g. lasota & hameury 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the ` standard ' version of the dim can not account for the properties of wz sge - type dwarf novae with large outburst amplitudes and long recurrence times .",
    "( some of these systems are also called toads , but we will not use this name here . )    the wz sge - type dwarf novae resemble transient lmbhbs and lmnsbs ( lasota 1996a , b ; kuulkers , howell & van paradijs 1996 ) and it was suggested quite early ( van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ; cannizzo , ghosh & wheeler 1995 ; huang & wheeler 1989 ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) that the same mechanism that triggers outbursts in dwarf novae also operates in transient lmbhbs and lmnsbs . however , detailed attempts to explain the properties of sxt outbursts ( mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) failed to reproduce the observed long recurrence times , which are of the order of 20 to 50 years in transient lmbhbs . moreover , spectral observations of quiescent sxts disagree seriously with the predictions of the dim ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ; lasota 1996a ) . in particular , the observed x - ray emission in lmbhbs is more than four orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by the dim .",
    "not surprisingly similar problems are encountered in the dwarf nova case ( lasota 1996b ) .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the quiescent disk properties in sxts could be explained with a model in which the accretion flow consists of two components : an outer cb - type thin accretion disk and an inner , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) in which the radiative efficiency is very low .",
    "a similar model was proposed by lasota , hameury & hur ( 1995 ) for wz sge . there",
    ", however , the inner ` hole ' in the cb accretion disk could be due to a weak magnetic field ( patterson et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) model quiescent optical and uv radiation was emitted by the outer disk and the x - ray radiation came from the adaf .",
    "the model , however , had a serious problem ( lasota , narayan & yi 1996 ) ; some regions of the outer disk had effective temperatures within the unstable range , @xmath5  k @xmath6  k ( wheeler 1996 ) .    a modified version of the two - component model was subsequently proposed by narayan , barret & mcclintock ( 1997 ) which eliminates this problem . the transition radius is larger so that the outer disk is cool enough to be stable at all radii ( @xmath7  k ) . in this model ,",
    "the optical and uv emission are from the adaf and not the outer disk .",
    "the adaf also produces the x - ray emission .",
    "the outer disk contributes only in the infrared , and even in this band its emission is overshadowed by the radiation from the secondary star .",
    "it was noticed by lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the transition radii of sxts , as determined from h@xmath2 line observations , are close to the values for which the outer thin disk would be _ globally _ stable .",
    "( by global stability , we mean that the disk can stably support a constant mass accretion rate ; thus , the system will not undergo a limit cycle . )",
    "based on this fact , lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that there may exist other closely related systems with a slightly larger transition radius in which the outer disk would , in fact , be globally stable . in the absence of significant variations of the mass - transfer rate such systems would not have transient outbursts , but would be steady and persistent .",
    "in addition , they would be extremely dim in x - rays , and quite under - luminous even in the optical , so that they would be very difficult to detect .",
    "this ` hidden population ' is the main subject of this paper .    for the remainder of the paper , we refer to optically thin two - temperature adafs simply as adafs ( see chen et al .",
    "1995 for a distinction between various branches of accretion solutions ) .",
    "we refer to lmbhbs with a globally stable truncated thin disk ( the topic of this paper ) as faint persistent lmbhbs , or equivalently cold steady systems , and refer to the more standard transient lmbhbs with a globally unstable truncated thin disk as transient lmbhbs , or equivalently bh sxts .",
    "the symbols @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to mass , mass accretion rate and radius in physical units , respectively , while the symbols @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the same quantities in solar units ( @xmath14 ) , in eddindgton units ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and in schwarzschild units ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "we discuss the structure and stability of lmbhb accretion flows according to the model of quiescent sxts developed by narayan et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the accretion occurs primarily as a thin disk from the outer radius @xmath19 down to a transition radius @xmath20 , and then switches to a two - temperature adaf for @xmath21 .",
    "the transition itself is not explained from first principles , but is introduced empirically .",
    "this two - zone model successfully explains the observed properties of several sxts in quiescence ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a ; hameury et al .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) show that such models also explain the various spectral states of black hole candidates , such as the high state , the intermediate state , and the low state , as sequences of varying accretion rate and location of the transition radius .",
    "lasota et al . (",
    "1996 ) discussed the mechanism for the origin of outbursts in bh sxts and argued that the outbursts must be triggered by an instability in the outer thin disk component of the flow rather than in the inner adaf zone .",
    "two recent studies have strengthened the argument .",
    "first , hameury et al . (",
    "1997b ) have successfully reproduced all the properties of the rise to outburst of the bh sxt gro j1655 - 40 with a model in which the outburst is triggered by the thermal - viscous instability of the outer disk .",
    "second , detailed stability studies have confirmed that two - temperature adafs are essentially thermally and viscously stable ( kato et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; wu , 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore focus in this paper on the stability properties of the outer disk .    in the dim",
    ", the stability criterion for a disk annulus can be expressed in terms of the local mass accretion rate @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath22 lies between two critical values , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then the effective temperature of the disk lies in the unstable range ( 5000 - 8000  k ) , and the local annulus is thermally and viscously unstable .",
    "the disk is globally stable , and does not experience outbursts , whenever all its annuli are stable .",
    "this can be achieved in two ways .",
    "first , the disk can be in a hot , stable equilibrium if @xmath25 constant @xmath26 for all radii @xmath10 in the disk .",
    "this is the standard scenario for persistent x - ray binaries and has been discussed recently by van paradijs ( 1996 ) , who included the effect of x - ray irradiation ( but see also dubus et al .",
    "second , the disk can be in a cold , stable equilibrium if @xmath25 constant @xmath27 at all @xmath10 .",
    "it is the second option that we are interested in here .",
    "calculations of thin disk vertical equilibria ( @xcite ; see also ludwig , meyer - hofmeister & ritter 1994 ) give @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the turbulent viscosity parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , @xmath30 is the mass of the accreting primary in solar mass units , and @xmath10 is the radius of the annulus under consideration .",
    "since @xmath24 is a steep function of @xmath10 , we are unlikely to find a system with a cold , stable equilibrium if the thin accretion disk extends all the way down to the last stable orbit around a black hole .",
    "the limit on @xmath31 in this case is so low ( of order @xmath32 typically ) that any system that satisfies the constraint @xmath33 would be observationally very uninteresting ( this statement is true even if we use very low values of @xmath2 , e.g. @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , if the disk is truncated at a radius that is significantly outside the marginally stable orbit , then it is possible to have a globally stable cold flow with reasonable values of @xmath31 .",
    "( [ eq : mdcrit- ] ) shows that for a given , constant , accretion rate @xmath31 there exists a critical radius @xmath35 given by    @xmath36    if the transition from the outer disk to the adaf occurs at a radius @xmath0 greater than this @xmath35 , the flow will be cold and globally stable .    in two - component accretion flows ,",
    "the transition between the thin disk and the adaf most likely occurs over a range of radius by the gradual evaporation of the thin disk material ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the transition is thus not abrupt , although the width of the transition region is likely to be narrow ( esin et al .",
    "1997 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume for the remainder of this work that the evaporation process does not affect the disk stability .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation if the evaporation law is steep ( for example , the @xmath37 law for the coronal accretion rate used by esin et al .",
    "1997 ) since the accretion rate in the thin disk is then almost unchanged except very close to the transition radius . note that evaporation reduces the accretion rate in the disk . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdcrit- ] ) , it should therefore increase the stability of the disk .",
    "the location of @xmath0 is ultimately determined by the physics of the evaporation of gas from the thin accretion disk to the adaf .",
    "this physics is poorly understood .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 , narayan & yi 1995 , honma 1996 ) to explain the transition , but none of these models has reached a sufficient level of detail to allow quantitative predictions ( see e.g. narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 for a discussion ) .    quite independent of the actual process of evaporation , various limits can be derived on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "first , the dynamics of the incoming stream from the secondary leads to a maximum value of @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", observations of the @xmath39 line from the disk provide an independent limit on @xmath0 .",
    "these two constraints are consistent with each other , as we show in  2.1.1 and  2.1.2 .",
    "another limit arises from the fact that for a given mass accretion rate , an adaf is not allowed beyond a certain maximum radius @xmath40 .",
    "we estimate this limit in  2.1.3 .",
    "these arguments give only upper limits on @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we assume that the adaf extends out to the largest radius it is allowed ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , that is to the smallest of the various upper limits .",
    "observations of quiescent sxts are consistent with this assumption , as we discuss in  2.1.4 , and we assume that the systems we discuss in this paper also satisfy this rule .",
    "however , we note that the assumption is apparently not satisfied in the nucleus of ngc 4258 ( gammie , blandford & narayan 1998 ) .      according to the calculations of lubow & shu ( 1976 ) and lubow ( 1989 ) , a substantial fraction of the stream of matter from",
    "the secondary overflows the rim of the accretion disk and impacts at a radius @xmath41 that is significantly smaller than the outer radius of the disk , @xmath42 .",
    "such overflows are seen in ` dipping ' low mass x - ray binaries ( see e.g. uno et al .",
    "1997 ; frank , king & lasota 1987 ) and in cataclysmic variables ( see warner 1995 ) .",
    "we do not expect the adaf zone to extend to radii larger than the impact radius of the stream .",
    "this is because the cold stream moves very rapidly ( essentially at free - fall speed ) from the roche lobe of the secondary to the impact point ; it is unlikely that the material in the stream could evaporate into an adaf in this short time . at the very least , we expect the cold incoming stream to form an annulus at the impact radius @xmath41 .",
    "more likely , the material will spread a little under the influence of viscous evolution before it evaporates fully .",
    "thus we expect @xmath43 .",
    "lubow s calculations show that , in the free - stream approximation , all overflowing streams converge to a single impact radius which scales to a good approximation as @xmath44 ( the coefficient corresponds to a low mass ratio @xmath45 , which is valid for all the systems we consider ) . here , @xmath46 is the circularization radius of the binary ( frank et al .",

    "since we have argued that @xmath41 is an upper limit on the transition radius , we write @xmath50    the systems that we consider span almost two orders of magnitude in orbital period . since the circularization radius varies as @xmath51 , the impact radius also spans a wide range . in principle",
    ", the parameter @xmath52 may vary in some complicated fashion as a function of @xmath41 . for simplicity ,",
    "we treat @xmath52 as a free parameter , which absorbs all the complicated physics associated with the stream dynamics , and consider values between 0.1 and 0.48 .",
    "observations of @xmath39 emission lines from the disk constrain the value of @xmath0 in quiescent bh sxts . as emphasized by narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , half the full - width at zero - intensity of the @xmath53 emission line provides a good lower limit to the speed of matter , @xmath54 , at the transition radius .",
    "this can be translated into an upper limit on the transition radius through the relation ( assuming a keplerian disk ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the speed of light and @xmath57 is the inclination of the binary system to the line of sight .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used this relation to derive upper limits on @xmath20 in the sxts a0620 - 00 , v404 cyg and nova mus 91 , and hameury et al .",
    "( 1997b ) did the same for gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "we derive upper limits for three other quiescent systems , gro j0422 + 32 , gs2000 + 25 and nova oph 77 , using the inclinations summarized in table  [ tab : systems ] and the following lower limits on @xmath54 , collected from the literature : @xmath58 in gro j0422 + 32 ( garcia et al . 1996 , orosz & bailyn 1995 ) , @xmath59 in gs2000 + 25 ( harlaftis et al . 1996 ) and @xmath60 in nova oph . 77 ( harlaftis et al . 1997 ) .",

    "note that the circularization radius and hence the impact radius in a binary system depends on the masses of the stars .",
    "therefore , a knowledge of the masses as functions of the orbital period of the system is required in order to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rtr ] ) .",
    "the mass of the secondary at a given period is theoretically constrained by binary evolution theory .",

    "1992 ) . when the secondary is a subgiant or a giant",
    ", the period mass relation is less simple because it depends also on the core mass of the star ( e.g. king 1988 ) . for simplicity , in fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] we have assumed that we have ` typical ' systems with @xmath63 and @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this assumption is valid for four of the sxts listed in table  [ tab : systems ] .",
    "the systems j0422 + 32 , j1655 - 40 and v404 cyg deviate somewhat from this assumption .",
    "we have derived values of @xmath0 for these systems , taking into account their actual masses ; the results are not very different .",
    "technically , the @xmath53 line widths only give upper limits on the transition radius ; the fact that @xmath53 emission is not observed from gas orbiting at higher speeds may merely mean that such high velocity material does not emit enough radiation to be detectable ( small emitting area ) .",
    "we make the stronger assumption that the high velocity material is absent altogether in the cold disk , so that the @xmath53 line widths directly give an estimate of @xmath0 to within a factor of a few . in that case",
    ", we see that most of the systems shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] are consistent with @xmath65 .",
    "more precise calculations of the circularization radii of j0422 + 32 , j1655 - 40 and v404 cyg , taking into account @xmath30 and @xmath66 in table  [ tab : systems ] , show that the first two of these systems are also in general agreement with the condition @xmath67 .",
    "the only peculiar object is v404 cyg , which appears to require @xmath68 .",
    "this system , however , has the longest orbital period and may behave differently because of this ( see  2.1.3 ) .",
    "ycki , done & smith ( 1998 ) have also argued for a low value of the transition radius in v404 cyg .      at each radius @xmath13 in the accretion flow",

    "the second break at @xmath116 hr corresponds to the transition from @xmath117 to @xmath118 . note that faint persistent systems are more likely to exist at large orbital periods because the stability criterion is less stringent there .",
    "the purpose of this section is to establish that transient systems could be limited to a fairly narrow instability band in the @xmath119 plane . outside this band",
    ", the systems would be either hot and steady ( at high accretion rates ) or cold and steady ( at low accretion rates ) .",
    "we also establish that known transient systems are all found within the instability band .",
    "this test requires a knowledge of the orbital periods and mass accretion rates of the various bh sxts .",

    "the accretion rates in the systems are , however , more uncertain and are necessarily model - dependent .",
    "we describe below the method we use to estimate @xmath9 .",
    "the standard procedure to estimate the average mass accretion rate in a sxt is based on the idea that sxts mainly store mass during quiescence and accrete it suddenly during an outburst ( e.g. mcclintock et al .",
    "1983 , van paradijs 1996 ) . the rate at which mass accumulates in the disk , @xmath120 , can be estimated by measuring the integrated flux from the system during an outburst (  3.1.1 ) .",
    "this is a reliable method since there is good evidence that sxts accrete via a thin disk in outburst ( e.g. tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) , so that the radiative efficiency during outburst is well understood .",
    "however , the successful application of adaf models to bh sxts in quiescence ( narayan , barret & mcclintock , 1997 ) shows that these systems accrete substantial amounts of mass even during quiescence via an inefficiently radiating adaf (  3.1.2 ) .",

    ", we derive @xmath120 and @xmath122 for the seven bh sxts listed in table  [ tab : systems ] .",
    "the accumulation rate @xmath120 can be deduced from the total fluence , @xmath124 , of one of its outbursts and the inter - outburst time , @xmath125 : @xmath126 where @xmath56 is the speed of light and @xmath127 is the radiative efficiency of accretion during outburst .",
    "we assume @xmath128 , which is appropriate for a normal thin accretion disk around a schwarzschild or slowly spinning black hole .    the observational data and the system parameters that we use to estimate the accumulation mass accretion rates are listed in table  [ tab : systems ] .",

    "this could explain , at least in part , the relatively low estimate obtained for @xmath120 ( see table  [ tab:7mdot ] ) .",
    "the evolutionary status of j1655 - 40 is also very peculiar ( see e.g. kolb 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , zhang , cui & chen ( 1997 ) have argued that the central black hole in j1655 - 40 is a kerr black hole in fast prograde rotation , so that the efficiency of accretion in the system is more likely to be @xmath143 rather than @xmath135 .",
    "taking this into account would reduce @xmath120 even more in this system .",
    "finally , the mass loss from the secondary could be related to the jet activity in this source ( hjellming & rupen 1995 , king - private communication ) which would make it difficult to get an independent estimate of @xmath123 .",
    "four of the seven bh sxts listed in table  [ tab : systems ] , namely a0620 - 00 , gs2000 + 25 , nova mus 91 and nova oph 77 , have mass characteristics relatively close to those of a ` typical ' system with @xmath63 and @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "the estimated ranges of @xmath123 in these four systems are shown in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : critobs ] shows that for such values of @xmath52 , the four systems are indeed unstable according to the stability criterion .",
    "the estimates of @xmath123 in gs2000 + 25 and nova mus 91 are subject to uncertainty and may well go down .",
    "however , they will not do so by more than an order of magnitude ( cf  3.1.3 ) .",
    "therefore , these systems are likely to remain in the unstable zone . for the three other bh sxts , namely j0422 + 32 , j1655 - 40 and v404 cyg",
    ", the stability criteria have to be computed for their specific mass characteristics .",
    "we find that j0422 + 32 and j1655 - 40 are unstable , so long as @xmath148 , although the evidence is less strong than in the previous four cases ( the estimates of @xmath123 are not firmly above the stability line corresponding to @xmath104 ) .",
    "this could be explained in j0422 + 32 by the fact that the mass of the central black hole , which has a substantial effect on the stability criterion , is not well known ( beekman et al .",
    "1997 ; we take @xmath149 ) . in the case of j1655 - 40",
    ", we expect @xmath123 to be larger than our estimate ( because some activity was not taken into account , cf  3.1.3 ) , which could easily drive the system firmly into the region of instability .",
    "our analysis shows that v404 cyg would be stable if @xmath104 and unstable if @xmath150 .",
    "this is consistent with the maximum value for @xmath52 deduced from observations of this system (  2.1.2 ) .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the truncated disks found in bh sxts are unstable and that the systems will undergo the thermal - viscous instability .",
    "all of these systems are indeed transients and do show large variability .",
    "thus the same mechanism could drive outbursts of both dne and sxts ( van paradijs & verbunt 1984 ) .",
    "it is not possible , however , to firmly rule out the possibility that at least some of the disks are stable since the systems generally lie close to the stability region . in this case",
    "sxt outbursts could be triggered by variations in the mass - transfer rate ( but outbursts would still be due to a thermal - viscous instability ) as proposed by @xcite .",
    "a criterion for the stability of ( hot ) irradiated disks in sxts was derived by van paradijs ( 1996 ) ( see however dubus et al .",
    "the criterion is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : critobs ] .",

    "the same is true for j0422 + 32 , j1655 - 40 and v404 cyg ( not shown ) .    to summarize",
    ", the @xmath145 plane is divided into three zones .",
    "the region to the lower right in fig .",
    "[ fig : critobs ] , below the solid line ( which line we choose depends on the choice of @xmath52 ) , corresponds to faint persistent systems in which the disk is in a globally stable cool state .",
    "no such systems have been found yet , but they may well exist and remain undetected , as they are likely to be very dim .",
    "the middle zone , between the solid and dashed lines corresponds to an unstable disk .",
    "such systems are expected to be transients , and indeed all known dynamically confirmed bh sxts are found in this region .",
    "finally , the region above the dashed line corresponds to luminous persistent systems in which the irradiated disk is in a globally stable hot state .",
    "the persistent black hole binaries , cyg x-1 and lmc x-3 , both lie in this region .",
    "neither is a lmbhb , but van paradijs criterion applies equally to high mass binaries ( provided they accrete from a disk ) .",
    "a number of other persistent black hole binaries may also lie in this zone , but there is not yet enough dynamical information to determine their status .",
    "figure  [ fig : critobs ] shows that if transition radii in quiescent bh sxts were slightly larger ( i.e if @xmath52 were larger ) , some of the systems would become globally stable and would correspond to faint persistent lmbhbs .",
    "do such systems exist in the galaxy ?",
    "to answer the above question , we use models of binary evolution to predict the accretion rates in binary systems as a function of their orbital periods and check if any of the evolutionary tracks cross the lowermost zone in fig .  [ fig : critobs ] .",
    "the standard theory of binary evolution relies on the roche - lobe model for the description of mass transfer in binary star systems . depending on which mechanism drives the mass transfer , whether it is loss of orbital angular momentum through gravitational radiation and magnetic braking , or expansion of the donor as it evolves away from the main - sequence ,",
    "the systems are classified as j - driven or n - driven systems .",
    "there is a ` bifurcation ' orbital period separating the two classes such that above this period we find n - driven systems whose @xmath108 increase with time , and below this period we find j - driven systems with @xmath108 decreasing with time .",
    "the precise value of the bifurcation period depends on the history of the system .",
    "estimates range from @xmath151 days ( e.g. pylyser & savonije 1988 , king , kolb & burderi 1996 ) .    following king et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we take the mass transfer rates in j - driven systems with gravitational radiation ( gr ) and magnetic braking ( mb ) , and n - driven system with secondary expansion ( ex ) , to be given by : @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 note that eq .",
    "( [ ev ] ) is a large oversimplification ; a substantial scatter around this prediction is expected , depending on the precise history of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : critmdot ] for more accurate evolutionary tracks ) .",
    "the exact form of the magnetic braking law is not well established .",
    "( [ mb ] ) corresponds to the formula due to verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) .",
    "other models of magnetic braking have been proposed in the literature ( see e.g. warner 1995 ) but they give similar results ( not differing by more than a factor of a few ) . eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) does not apply , however , to systems with orbital periods @xmath155 hr .",
    "the magnetic braking model represents well the _",
    "secular _ mean accretion rate of cataclysmic variables and allows an understanding of the so called ` period - gap ' in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic binaries .",
    "( contrary to some recent and less recent assertions , the period gap does exist , e.g. hellier & naylor 1998 . )",
    "one observes , however , a rather large scatter of mass transfer rates deduced from observations , a large part of which is clearly intrinsic ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "this means that some systems and some classes of systems transfer mass at rates different from the secular one .",
    "these fluctuations are compatible with the secular evolution as long as the durations of the fluctuations are much shorter than the characteristic evolutionary time of the system ( @xmath156 years in the case of magnetic braking ) .",
    "we plot in fig  [ fig : critmdot]a the predictions of the binary evolution model for gr driven ( long - dashed line , eq .  ( [ gr ] ) ) and mb driven ( dotted - dashed line , eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) ) mass transfer rates , for orbital periods up to @xmath157 h. at longer periods , we plot the predictions for secondary expansion corresponding to detailed evolutionary tracks rather than the crude eq  ( [ ev ] ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were computed with a semi - analytical model , described by verbunt & van den heuvel ( 1995 ) .",
    "it gives results which compare well with those of more detailed stellar evolution models since the properties of a ( sub)giant star depend mainly on the mass of its core ( webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ) .",
    "four examples of evolutionary tracks are shown in fig  [ fig : critmdot]a for binary systems with an initial mass of the secondary @xmath118 ( dashed line ) and @xmath139 ( dotted line ) , with two different initial periods ( @xmath158 hr and @xmath159 hr ) .",
    "the mass of the primary is @xmath63 in each case , but the predictions for the mass transfer rates increase by only @xmath160 if the mass of the primary is @xmath161 .",
    "the composition is assumed to be solar .",
    "note that the specific evolutionary state of j1655 - 40 is probably not accurately represented by any of the evolutionary tracks shown ( e.g. kolb 1998 ) .",
    "also plotted in fig  [ fig : critmdot]a are our estimates of @xmath123 for the seven known bh sxts . while the predictions for gr driven and secondary expansion driven mass transfer ( eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) ) appear in reasonable agreement with the estimates of @xmath123 , there is clearly a problem in the case of mb driven mass transfer ( eq .",

    "one should keep in mind that the estimates of @xmath123 in gs2000 + 25 and nova mus 91 may well go down by as much as an order of magnitude (  3.1.3 ) , which would make the discrepancy more serious .",
    "the disagreement would be even more acute if we did not invoke a low radiative efficiency adaf in quiescence .    quite apart from the inconsistency between the estimates of @xmath123 and the magnetic braking prediction",

    "( [ mb ] ) is correct , then there should be no transient lmbhbs with @xmath162 hr . but five of the seven transient systems we study have periods in this range .",
    "equation  ( [ mb ] ) is clearly inapplicable to these systems .",
    "how do we resolve this discrepancy ? there is no theoretical reason or observational evidence to suggest that magnetic braking does not operate in lmbhbs .",
    "there are reasons , however , to think that the companions in lmbhbs could be evolved ( king et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this case eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) becomes : @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "a similar formula can be deduced for gr driven mass transfer with an evolved donor .",

    "there is an additional argument , based on the recurrence times of bh sxts , which shows that eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) is inappropriate to predict mass transfer rates in lmbhbs .",
    "this is discussed in the next subsection .",

    "as suggested by observations ( e.g. harrop - allin & warner 1996 ) we will assume that @xmath171 is about 70% of the roche - lobe equivalent radius .",

    "nova wz sge , more than @xmath174 g of matter was accreted onto the central white dwarf ( smak 1993 ) . taking the disk radius in this system to be @xmath175 cm , we see from eq .",
    "( [ diskmass ] ) that @xmath2 in quiescence must be very low ( @xmath176 ) , unless , due to irradiation of the secondary , mass transfer is increased during the outburst ( hameury , lasota & hur 1997 ) .",

    "this conclusion is independent of the uncertainty on the magnetic braking law because magnetic braking only predicts larger accretion rates .    at long periods ,",
    "however , some of the evolutionary tracks do predict accretion rates low enough to allow the existence of faint lmbhbs .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath192 , but some persistent systems are expected even if @xmath193 .",
    "thus , faint persistent lmbhbs are viable at long orbital periods , provided that transition radii in these systems are not too small ( i.e @xmath52 not @xmath194 ) .",
    "what would such systems look like ?",
    "the main difference between a faint persistent lmbhb and a quiescent sxt is that @xmath195 in the former and @xmath196 in the latter . of course , since @xmath109 is a function of @xmath197 , variations of the mass - transfer rate can move systems from one class to another",
    ".    in both kinds of system",
    ", @xmath20 is sufficiently large that the emission from the outer thin disk is weak and unimportant relative to the emission from the secondary star .",
    "further , the emission from the adaf is dominated by the regions of the flow close to the black hole ( @xmath198 ) , which means that the precise value of @xmath20 is unimportant . for both reasons",
    ", we expect the spectrum of a faint persistent lmbhb to be very similar to that of a quiescent sxt with the same mass accretion rate ( or similar orbital period ) .    by the arguments given earlier",
    ", we expect faint persistent lmbhbs to have relatively long orbital periods ( @xmath199 hr ) and fairly large mass transfer rates ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "we show in fig  [ fig : specfaint ] predicted spectra of representative faint persistent lmbhbs ( solid lines ) as they would appear if the sources were located at a distance of @xmath201 kpc .",
    "three different accretion rates are shown , corresponding to a black hole mass @xmath63 and @xmath94 . a comparison between fig .  [ fig : specfaint ] and figs .",
    "[ fig:4spec ] and [ fig:3spec ] reveals the strong spectral similarity between faint persistent lmbhbs and quiescent sxts .    in the three known bh sxts with long orbital periods , namely v404 cyg ( @xmath202 hr ) , j1655 - 40 ( 62.7 hr ) and 4u 1543 - 47 ( 26.9 hr ) , the secondary dominates the optical and ir emission in quiescence ( this is true even in the case of the cool companion in v404 cyg where the disk contributes less than about 15% in optical and ir ; casares et al .",
    "1993 ; shahbaz et al .",
    "we expect faint persistent lmbhbs to have subgiant secondaries similar to those found in these three bh sxts .",
    "we show in fig  [ fig : specfaint ] model black body spectra corresponding to the secondaries in v404 cyg , gro j1655 - 40 and 4u 1543 - 47 .",
    "as expected , the secondaries dominate the emission in the optical band ; the accretion flow contributes very little .",
    "clearly , it would be very difficult to discover faint persistent lmbhbs via any kind of broadband survey in the optical .",
    "one could in principle look for excess emission in blue and ultraviolet radiation , arising from synchrotron radiation in the adaf , but this is not likely to be a very effective technique .    of course , if any particular system is suspected to be a faint persistent lmbhb , it would be relatively easy to verify its lmbhb nature through observations .",
    "the orbital motion of the secondary could be confirmed through measurements of the doppler shifts of its spectral lines .",
    "this would reveal the mass function of the binary and may even lead to a determination of the mass of the black hole ( as in the best bh sxts ) .",
    "also , the detection of a broad double - humped @xmath39 line would reveal the presence of the outer thin accretion disk , just as in quiescent bh sxts .",
    "finally , observations in x - rays would reveal the presence of the adaf .",
    "another severe problem is that even if one did discover a candidate system , it will not be easy to confirm that it is a faint persistent lmbhb rather than a quiescent sxt .",
    "sxts have typical recurrence times of 20 to 50 years .",
    "one would have to observe the candidate system for at least 50 years before one could be reasonably confident that it is not a sxt .",
    "whether or not faint persistent lmbhbs exist in the galaxy depends on the mass transfer rates @xmath114 and transition radii @xmath0 in black hole binaries . while our predictions of the mass transfer rates , especially via secondary expansion , are relatively robust , this is not the case for our estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "we present a specific prescription for estimating the transition radius , based on stream dynamics and other considerations .",
    "observations of @xmath39 emission lines provide only upper limits to the values of @xmath0 . in the absence of a more complete theory of gas evaporation from the thin disk to the adaf",
    ", the location of the transition radius remains a major uncertainty of the model .",
    "indeed , until this issue is resolved it is difficult to estimate what fraction of the lmbhb population in the galaxy might correspond to faint persistent systems .",
    "another uncertainty is related to time variability of the mass transfer rate .",
    "we have shown that the known sxts have outer disks that are unstable to the thermal - viscous instability of the dim , and therefore that these systems would be unstable even with a steady mass transfer from the secondary .",
    "however , kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996 ) recently emphasized the striking similarities between the lightcurves of wz sge type dwarf novae and sxts . in the case of the wz sge type systems",
    ", one needs to invoke a variable mass transfer rate , with an enhancement during the outburst , if one wishes to avoid using extremely low values of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 ( see hameury et al .",
    "if lmbhbs have similar variable mass transfer rates , then even those systems that ought to be faint and persistent by virtue of their mean @xmath203 could be driven into transient behavior by fluctuations in @xmath203 .",
    "note also that the existence of faint persistent lmbhbs is unlikely if the transition radii are substantially smaller than the observational upper limits inferred in quiescent bh sxts , or if @xmath72 is smaller than @xmath134 ( e.g. @xmath135 ) .",
    "currently , there is a discrepancy between theoretical estimates of the rate of formation of black hole binaries and observational estimates of the number of lmbhbs in the galaxy ; the former falls short by a significant factor ( e.g. portegies zwart , verbunt & ergma 1997 ) . if in addition to the known population of sxts there were also an undiscovered population of faint persistent lmbhbs , the discrepancy would clearly increase .",
    "we have not considered low mass neutron star binaries for several reasons .",
    "first , the energy advected via the adaf onto a ns would be reradiated from the ns surface ( narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ) ; the reemitted radiation would modify the structure of the adaf ( narayan & yi , 1995 ) and , to some extent , the stability properties of the thin disk as well ( van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "second , given the uncertainties in the structure and emission spectrum of the boundary layer between the accretion flow and the ns surface , it is difficult to make any quantitative predictions .",
    "finally , lmnsbs may exhibit a strong ` propeller ' effect ( e.g. zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) which is difficult to model .",
    "on the other hand , work on faint persistent lmnsbs is well worth the effort .",
    "because the advected energy is reradiated from the ns surface , faint persistent lmnsbs are expected to be brighter than faint persistent lmbhbs .",
    "a population of faint persistent lmnsbs may thus be easier to identify than their black hole counterparts .",
    "recurrence time scales in lmnsbs are also shorter than in lmbhbs .",
    "therefore , one could more quickly determine whether a candidate lmnsb is persistent or transient .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the global stability of lmbhbs assuming that the accretion flow around the black hole is composed of two zones : an adaf for radii less than a transition radius @xmath1 and a thin accretion disk for radii beyond @xmath0 .",
    "the critical issue is the location of the transition radius .",
    "observations of @xmath39 emission line widths constrain @xmath1 in quiescent bh sxts (  2.1.2 ) .",
    "the observational constraints are consistent with an empirical prescription we have developed for predicting @xmath0 on the basis of stream dynamics (  2.1.1 ) and adaf physics (  2.1.3 ) .",
    "the second issue is the mass transfer rates @xmath203 in lmbhbs .",
    "we estimate @xmath203 in the known sxts from observations (  3.1.1 and 3.1.2 ) and compare the estimates with the rates predicted by theoretical models of binary evolution under the influence of gravitational radiation , magnetic braking and secondary expansion (  4.1 ) .",
    "the observational and theoretical estimates are in general agreement , except in the case of magnetic braking where the predicted mass transfer rate is much too large . for this and other reasons ( explained in  4.1 and  4.2 ) we assume that the current prescriptions for magnetic braking are invalid in bh sxts and ignore magnetic braking in our models .    by combining the theoretical and observational input on @xmath0 and @xmath203 , and comparing the derived values with the standard model of the thermal - viscous instability in disks ,",
    "we show that all the known lmbhbs should be transients .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that they are all known to be sxts , providing general confirmation of our methods .",
    "our model also predicts that a number of lmbhbs , especially those with somewhat longer orbital periods , might be non - transients .",
    "these steady systems would be faint and persistent , and extremely difficult to discover .",
    "the prediction of such a population of black hole binaries is the main result of the paper .",
    "we calculate model spectra of these systems , and show that the spectra are very similar to those of quiescent sxts .",
    "unfortunately , we have been unable to come up with an efficient search strategy to find these faint persistent lmbhbs .",
    "we are also unable to estimate how large a population these systems may constitute relative to the known population of bh sxts .",
