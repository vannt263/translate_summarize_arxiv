    "entanglement is a unique feature of a quantum system and entanglement entropy , defined through the von neumann entropy ( vne ) measure , is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of entanglement .",
    "@xcite consider a composite system that can be partitioned into two subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the vne of either of the subsystems is @xmath2 . here",
    ", the reduced density matrix @xmath3 is obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom in @xmath1 : @xmath4 and similarly for @xmath5 . in general , for a pure state @xmath6 of a composite system , the reduced density matrix is a mixture , and the corresponding entropy is a good measure of entanglement .    the scaling behavior of entanglement entropy is a particularly useful characterization near a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy can show nonanalyticity at the phase transition even when the ground state energy ( the quantum analog of the classical free energy ) is analytic .",
    "while these ideas have been studied in a number of translation - invariant models,@xcite there have been far fewer investigations of random quantum critical points ( for notable exceptions , see ref .  ) .",
    "in particular , noninteracting electrons moving in a disordered potential can undergo continuous quantum phase transitions between an extended metallic and a localized insulating state as the fermi energy is varied across a critical energy @xmath7 .",
    "well known examples are the anderson transition in three dimensions and the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) plateau transition in two dimensions where the ground state energy does not exhibit any nonanalyticity . in contrast , vne will be shown to exhibit nonanalyticity at these transitions and a scaling behavior . at the outset",
    ", it should be emphasized that because of the single particle and disorder - dominated nature of these quantum phase transitions , entanglement as characterized by vne and its critical scaling behavior are fundamentally different from those calculated for interacting systems .",
    "this statement will be made more precise later .    in a noninteracting electronic system close to a disordered critical point",
    ", the wave function intensity at energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 , fluctuates strongly at each spatial point @xmath10 and , consequently , has a broad ( non - gaussian ) distribution even in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite this non - self - averaging nature of the wave function intensity is characterized through the scaling of its moments . in particular , moments of normalized wave function intensity , @xmath11 ( called the generalized inverse participation ratios ) , obey the finite - size scaling ansatz , @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 is the system size , @xmath14 is the exponent characterizing the divergence of correlation length , @xmath15 is a scaling function with @xmath16 close to the critical point @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath8 is tuned away from @xmath7 , the system either tends towards an ideal metallic state with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the number of spatial dimensions ) or becomes localized with @xmath20 independent of @xmath13 .",
    "below , we first show that the disorder - averaged vne can be expressed as a derivative of @xmath11 and thus , its scaling behavior follows from multifractal analysis .",
    "after that , we apply our formalism to understand the numerical results on vne at the three dimensional anderson localization and iqh plateau transitions .",
    "vne in the anderson localization problem was studied previously,@xcite but the connection with mulitfractality and the unique features of vne at these quantum phase transitions have not been clearly elucidated .",
    "even though the disorder induced localization problem can be studied in a single particle quantum mechanics language , there is no obvious way to define entanglement entropy in this picture .",
    "however ( see ref .  ) , entanglement can be defined using the site occupation number basis in the second - quantized fock space .",
    "let us divide the lattice of linear size @xmath13 into two regions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a single particle eigenstate of a lattice hamiltonian at energy @xmath8 is represented in the site occupation number basis as @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the normalized single particle wave function at site @xmath10 and @xmath23 denotes a state having @xmath24 particles at site @xmath10 . we decompose the above sum over lattice sites @xmath10 into the mutually orthogonal terms , @xmath25 where @xmath26 with analogous expressions for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 states . notice that these states have the normalization @xmath29 where @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath31 with @xmath32 .    to obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath33 , we trace out the hilbert space over @xmath1 in the density matrix @xmath34 .",
    "this gives , @xmath35 the corresponding vne is given by @xmath36 in the above equation , we see that manifestly @xmath37 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath38 is bounded between @xmath39 and @xmath40 for any eigenstate .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the entanglement entropy in interacting quantum systems where it can be arbitrarily large near the critical point .",
    "the reason for this is also clear : even though we used a second - quantized language , we are dealing with a single particle state rather than a many body correlated state .",
    "consequently , the entanglement entropy does not grow arbitrarily large as a function of the size of @xmath0 .",
    "we also observe that at criticality , if the whole system size becomes very large in comparison with the subsystem @xmath0 , we can restrict the subsystem to be a single lattice site and study the scaling dependence with respect to the overall system size @xmath13 . then , using the ansatz of scale invariance , we can always find the scaling of the entanglement as a function of the subsystem size @xmath41 since near criticality , only the dimensionless ratio @xmath42 can enter any physical quantity . to extract scaling",
    ", we find the bipartite entanglement of a single site @xmath10 with the rest of the system and sum this over all lattice sites in the system .",
    "using eq . , we write this as @xmath43 \\ln \\left [ 1- |\\psi_e(r)|^2 \\right]\\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to leading order , the second term inside the square bracket in eq .",
    "can be dropped since @xmath44 at all points @xmath10 when the states are close to the critical energy .",
    "we can readily relate the disorder average ( denoted by overbar ) of this entropy to the multifractal scaling in eq . and get the @xmath13 scaling as @xmath45 we do not know the general form of the scaling function @xmath46 , but we can get the approximate @xmath13 dependence of the entropy in various limiting cases . for the exactly critical case when @xmath47 for all values of @xmath48 , we get @xmath49 where the constant @xmath50 is unique for each universality class . from the discussion following eq .",
    ", the leading scaling behavior of @xmath51 in the ideal metallic and localized states is given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . from the limiting cases ,",
    "we see that , in general , @xmath51 has the approximate form @xmath54 \\ln l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient function @xmath55 decreases from @xmath19 in the metallic state to @xmath56 at criticality and then drops to zero for the localized state .",
    "we will see that this scaling form is verified in our numerical simulations .",
    "the scaling form for the entanglement entropy averaged over all eigenstates of the single particle hamiltonian is also of interest since this scaling can change as a function of disorder strength . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the 3d anderson model on a cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath57 where @xmath58(@xmath59 ) is the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath60 of the lattice , and the second sum is over all nearest neighbors .",
    "we set @xmath61 , and the @xmath62 are random variables uniformly distributed in the range @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "it is known @xcite that as @xmath64 is decreased from a very high value , extended states appear at the band center below the critical disorder strength @xmath65 , and a recent work @xcite reported the localization length exponent @xmath66 .    the analysis leading to eq .",
    "also holds when we study wave functions at a single energy , say @xmath67 and increase the disorder strength in the anderson model across the critical value @xmath68 . in this case , the states at @xmath67 evolve continuously from fully metallic to critical and then finally localized , resulting in the approximate form for the entanglement entropy as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the normalized relative disorder strength and @xmath71 is a scaling function . in particular , as mentioned before , @xmath72 as @xmath73 , @xmath74 as @xmath75 , and @xmath76 when @xmath77 .",
    "next , we look at the energy - averaged entropy .",
    "we average eq . over the entire band of energy eigenvalues and construct the vne , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is also the total number of states in the band . then using eqs . and",
    ", one can show that close to @xmath77 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an _",
    "l independent _ constant , and @xmath82 are two universal functions corresponding to the two regimes @xmath83 and @xmath84 .     and @xmath85 , all data collapse to a universal functions @xmath82 .",
    "the two branches correspond to @xmath84 and @xmath83.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian [ eq . [ hamiltonian_anderson ] ] in a finite @xmath86 system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the maximum system size is @xmath87 , and the results are averaged over 20 disorder realizations .",
    "the scaling form of @xmath88 is given by eq . .",
    "figure  [ scaling_anderson1 ] shows the results of the data collapse with a choice of @xmath89 , and the nonuniversal constant @xmath85 is determined by a powerful algorithm described in ref .  .",
    "the successful data collapse reflects the nonanalyticity of the von neumann entropy and accuracy of the multifractal analysis .",
    "we also use the transfer matrix method @xcite to study the energy dependence of @xmath90 by considering a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) system with a size of @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "we use @xmath13 up to @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is found to be sufficient . to compute vne",
    ", we divide the quasi-1d system into @xmath95 cubes labeled by @xmath96 , each containing @xmath79 sites .",
    "we normalize the wave function within each cube and compute the vne , @xmath97 , in the @xmath98 cube , and finally @xmath99 is obtained by averaging over all cubes .     as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath64 computed in a system with @xmath100 .",
    "the square shows the mobility edge reported in ref .  .",
    "because of the finiteness of the system , the transition from the localized to the delocalized region is smooth.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    a typical @xmath99 with @xmath100 is shown in fig .  [ s_ew ] .",

    "( [ generalscaling2 ] ) is seen in fig .",
    "[ scaling_anderson2 ] .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath104 shows the expected behavior .",
