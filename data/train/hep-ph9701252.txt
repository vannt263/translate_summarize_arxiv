    "it is taken at a nonperturbative scale given by the dominant virtuality of the exchanged gluons . however , the first gluon in all diagrams couples at its upper end to an off - shell quark whose virtuality is in the perturbative region .",

    "note however that , since we use the cutting rules , the parts of the diagrams to the left and the right of the cut lines can be considered independently , and that the part to the right of the cut is just on - shell quark - quark or quark - antiquark scattering with no large virtuality involved .",

    "a behaviour in @xmath169 looks like the effect of the off - shell propagators in the amplitude whose denominators are limited by @xmath170 .",
    "notice that the numerators of the propagators , which also contain one power of @xmath154 do not seem to enter in the same way , their role is more complicated because the numerator of a quark propagator has a dirac matrix structure .",
    "we have calculated diffractive production of a @xmath2-pair in @xmath19 collisions with real or virtual photons in the model of nonperturbative two - gluon exchange due to landshoff and nachtmann .",
    "this allowed us to give numerical predictions for diffractive charm production at hera , for cross sections and spectra in @xmath66 and @xmath50 .",
    "in photoproduction we find a @xmath171 cross section in the region of @xmath172 for @xmath84 around @xmath173 .",
    "the mass spectrum peaks at rather low values of @xmath16 and then falls off roughly like @xmath174 , whereas the spectrum of the transverse momentum approximately behaves like a power of @xmath175 with an exponent around @xmath176 .    in diffractive dis",
    "the @xmath3 cross section we obtain is of order @xmath177 for @xmath67 from @xmath97 to @xmath178 and @xmath84 from @xmath179 to @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath19 cross sections exhibit a flat dependence on @xmath84 , typical of models with soft pomeron exchange .",
    "we suggest that even a coarse logarithmic binning in @xmath84 of the @xmath3 cross section should be useful to test this in the data .    expressing the @xmath2 mass spectra in terms of the diffractive charm structure functions we find that the transverse contribution @xmath180 does not scale for @xmath181 due to the restricted phase space at hera values of @xmath67 .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath182 for charm is comparable to the transverse one at small diffractive mass @xmath16 , i.e.  close to the largest kinematically allowed @xmath121 at given @xmath67 , at lower @xmath121 it is negligible .",
    "we have then compared @xmath183 with the diffractive structure function @xmath105 for light flavours , calculated in the same model , which reproduces the hera data within a factor of 2 or so , except in the region of small @xmath121 where the neglect of final states other that @xmath149 becomes a bad approximation .",
    "the contribution of @xmath2 to the diffractive structure function @xmath105 comes out below 5% in our model .",
    "the strong quark mass dependence of the integrated @xmath149 cross section can be understood in a simple way from the denominator of the propagator for the off - shell quark in the feynman diagrams , which appears squared in the cross section .",
    "its typical value is given by @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is some average @xmath50 .",
    "for photoproduction of heavy quarks we find indeed a quark mass dependence of the cross section approximately like @xmath169 , which together with the effect of the running strong coupling and the different quark charges leads to a ratio of @xmath157- to @xmath156-production of @xmath186 .",
