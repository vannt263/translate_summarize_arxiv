    "it has been extensively studied in different fields of physics involving wave propagation@xcite .",
    "the resonant transmission is present in mechanical waves analyzed in acoustic@xcite , in electromagnetic waves studied in optics@xcite , and in quantum mechanics@xcite . from esaki seminal papers@xcite ,",
    "electronic perfect tunnelling in a double barrier system has been explained in terms of the quasi - bound states ( qbs ) between the barriers@xcite .",
    "this understanding allowed the fabrication of resonant tunnelling diodes ( rtd ) , which present negative differential resistance and good performance in fast processes@xcite .",
    "electronic resonance is also present with three@xcite and more potential barriers .",
    "the specific conditions to obtain resonance depends on recurrences in the transmission functions , and on the shape of the barrier array , which can be divided into subsets of potentials or cells@xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider @xmath1-function shaped potential barriers .",
    "such a potential array has been useful to model several solid state systems like magnetic impurities and short range interactions@xcite .",
    "it has been used to study the conduction properties of crystals through the kronig - penney model@xcite and anderson localization in a disordered impurity array@xcite . in a solid state quantum information scenario ,",
    "@xmath1-function potential barriers are used to depict the instantaneous interaction between a flying spin and a fixed magnetic impurity @xcite , to implement teleportation@xcite and quantum memory@xcite .    here",
    "we study the conditions under which an array of @xmath0 @xmath1-function potential barriers , gives resonant transmission with an incident particle .",

    "the intrinsic qbs energy concept helps us to explain the working of a tunnelling energy filtering in such arrays .",
    "section 5 gives the conclusions .",
    "we consider an @xmath0 @xmath1-function potential barriers on a one - dimensional quantum wire along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "a moving particle with energy @xmath7 , is incident from the left end of the wire , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momentum and mass of the particle , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the strength and @xmath12 is position of the @xmath13-th potential barrier .",
    "the particle wavefunction @xmath14 in the region @xmath15 , is taken to be    @xmath16    where the wave number is @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the probability amplitudes for incoming ( @xmath20 ) and outgoing ( @xmath21 ) parts of the wavefunction , respectively .",
    "to relate the coefficients ( @xmath22 , @xmath23,@xmath18 and @xmath19 ) of the wavefuction on both sides of the @xmath13-th potential ( see figure 1 ) , we use the transfer matrix @xmath24    @xmath25    in terms of the dimensionless strength parameter @xmath26 and @xmath27 . another representation for the transfer matrix @xmath24",

    "an obvious and useful consequence is that @xmath37 .",
    "( [ con ] ) is very useful in simplifying the multiple products of @xmath38 s in the expression for the general transfer matrix in eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) above .    in this way , for no particle incident from the right of the @xmath0-th potential , that is @xmath39 ,",
    "the probability of transmission is    @xmath40    since det @xmath41 .",
    "we now present results for resonant transmission and perfect tunnelling ( @xmath42 ) for some specific arrays using the representation of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "in our previous work@xcite , some specific regular arrays were considered . here",

    "( [ d1 ] ) reduces to ( @xmath57 an integer ) since @xmath58 . ]",
    "@xmath59    this means that the @xmath0 potential array effectively acts like a single potential of strength @xmath60 .",
    "this behaviour is due to resonance between the particle wavefuction and the array geometry .",
    "note that the distance between any two potential locations need not be equal .",
    "the only requirement is that all @xmath61 be integer multiple of @xmath52 .",
    "clearly , a single potential can give @xmath42 only if it has zero strength .",
    "in the above case this means @xmath62 .      for @xmath2 system",
    "( [ d1 ] ) gives    @xmath63    if @xmath64 , then @xmath65 and this reduces to an effective @xmath66 case .",
    "thus for a genuine @xmath5 array we need @xmath67 , to be non - zero . from eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) one obtains    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 , @xmath51 , ... .",
    "thus , the transmission probability depends on three complex numbers namely @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the last two are contained in @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the condition for perfect tunnelling ( @xmath42 ) , can be expressed as    @xmath77    from this result , it is easy to see that if the two @xmath1-function potential have the same strength ( @xmath78 ) , then for @xmath79 one obtains @xmath42 for any @xmath80 ( for graphical representation and other details see @xcite ) .",
    "this can also be expressed as    @xmath81    where the wave number is @xmath17 , and the parameter @xmath82 . as the perfect tunnelling is present only when the incident particle energy is equal to a qbs energy@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ qbs2 ] ) is the transcendental equation for the qbs energies of an equal strength two-@xmath1-function potential array .      for a @xmath83 system eq .",

    "( [ mm3 ] ) represents the effect of single potential transfer matrices while the rest contain two independent relative phases from the wavefunction at the three sites of the delta function potential . for perfect tunnelling ( @xmath42 )",
    "these effects have to compensate each other .",
    "in other words , for @xmath42 there will be specific relations between the strength parameters @xmath103 ( equivalently the phase of @xmath104 ) and the phase factors @xmath105 coming from the wavefunction .    for further analysis we set @xmath106 .",
    "this is just a choice of the origin ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "even so , eq . ( [ mm3 ] )",
    "depends on five complex variables .",
    "guided by the simplest non - trivial case of @xmath5 , we take the phases of @xmath104 which contain the strength parameters , to be equal .",
    "that is , we take @xmath108 .",
    "this reduces eq .",

    "we can see the points of perfect tunnelling , which follows a @xmath52 periodicity in both @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "in addition , notice that the perfect tunnelling points fulfil the relation @xmath114 .",
    "this behaviour can be explained if we consider the qbs energies in the three - potential array .",
    "suppose that between every two contiguous @xmath1-function barriers , there is intrinsic qbs energy which depends on the geometry of the two barriers .",
    "then , consider an asymmetrical array , like the one depicted in figure 2 b ) .",
    "it has different values for the intrinsic qbs energies ( @xmath115 ) and no perfect transmission is expected . by contrast , the symmetrical array described in figure 2 c ) presents the same geometry for every two contiguous barriers and consequently the intrinsic qbs energies are equal ( @xmath116 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath117 will be the qbs energy of the three-@xmath1-function barrier array .",
    "the necessary symmetry dictates that @xmath118 or , given the periodicity of the wavefunction , @xmath119 .",
    "the last argument is incorporated in eq .",

    "when @xmath124 , eq .",

    "depending on specific relations between the four phases @xmath105 ( equivalently @xmath136 ) , eq .",
    "( [ m4 ] ) will represent arrays with @xmath66 , @xmath51 and @xmath3 . for a genuine @xmath127 array",
    "we need the quadrilinear term @xmath137 . using the properties of the @xmath34-matrices one can read off the following special cases :    a.",
    "the effect of resonance reduces the array to an effective @xmath138 system , if all @xmath105 ( or @xmath136 ) @xmath139 , @xmath51 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are equal .",

    ". these can arise in @xmath3-ways , namely a ) @xmath86 , @xmath135 , b ) @xmath132 , @xmath140 and c ) @xmath89 , @xmath141 . c.   the array is reduced to a three-@xmath1-function system .",
    "for an effective @xmath97 case , one of the trilinear products ; @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 should be non - zero with the quadrilinear term @xmath146 .",
    "then , two adjacent @xmath34-matrices should be equal and consequently the effective strength parameter would be the sum of the original parameters ( @xmath103 s ) .",
    "in this situation we distinguish the following different cases : 1 .",
    "@xmath89 , so @xmath147 , with @xmath148",
    ". the effective strength parameters at the three @xmath1-function potentials are ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 and @xmath149 .",
    "@xmath150 , so @xmath151 . the effective strength parameters are as in case ( a ) .",
    "@xmath91 , so @xmath152 , with @xmath153 . the effective strength parameters are @xmath94 , ( @xmath95 ) and @xmath149 .",
    "4 .   @xmath154 , gives @xmath155 gives a particular case of case ( c ) and it is the same as case ( b ) with the replacement @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "5 .   @xmath158 , gives @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "the effective strength parameters are @xmath94 , @xmath161 and ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the choice @xmath163 gives @xmath164 , a particular case of case ( e ) .",
    "however , this case is mathematically equivalent to case ( d ) since the @xmath103 s , the potential strength parameters are not fixed .",
    "d.   a genuine four-@xmath1 potential with @xmath165 . from eq .",
    "( [ m4 ] ) one obtains + @xmath166 + @xmath167    to find the conditions for perfect tunnelling in a genuine @xmath127 case , we choose the origin at @xmath107 ( @xmath168 ) , and we suppose that all @xmath1-potential have the same strength ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "we expect the existence of intrinsic qbs energies between every two contiguous potential , which have to be all equal to allow perfect tunnelling .",
    "as these energies depend on the potential separation , we infer that all separations are equal , meaning that @xmath170 and @xmath171 . with this considerations eq .",
    "( [ m42 ] ) reduces to    @xmath172    imposing the perfect tunnelling condition @xmath173 , we obtain    @xmath174    which is the transcendental relation to find the qbs energies of a four - equal strength @xmath1-function potential array .",
    "it should be noted that a special situation is present in the @xmath175 potential array ; when the first two and the last two potentials have perfect tunnelling separately . in this case , the four-@xmath1-function array can be seen as a system of two pairs of sub - arrays or cells with perfect tunnelling conditions . as we will discuss in the next section , we expect perfect tunnelling if the qbs energies of these two potential cells are the same .",
    "as we seen in the cases of specific arrays , it is always possible to use the resonance of the wavefunction with the geometry of the potential array to effectively reduce the number of potentials , and the complexity of the problem .",
    "this reduction is allowed only when the resonance is present in a row of adjacent potential .",
    "similar to that seen in the previous section , to obtain perfect tunnelling in a @xmath0 equal - strength @xmath1-function potential array , we can locate them in a series with the same distance one after the other .",
    "this assures us the matching of all the intrinsic qbs energies which will be the qbs energies of the whole array .",
    "another way to obtain perfect tunnelling in an @xmath0 @xmath1-function potential array is to separate it in cells of potentials , with perfect tunnelling conditions by themselves , as we in figure 3 a ) .",
    "we expect to have perfect tunnelling when the incident particle energy is equal to one qbs energy in every cell .",
    "the advantage of this method is that in principle , the two cells in figure 3 a ) can be located at any distance one from each other with some resonance in the non perfect tunnelling energies .",
    "for example , if we locate two or more identical cells , we can expect perfect tunnelling at the incident energies which match all the qbs energies of a single cell ( see figure 3 b ) ) .",
    "by contrast , if the cells are different , such as three and two @xmath1-function potentials as is shown in figure 3 c ) , we only have the perfect tunnelling conditions when incident energy is equal to one qbs energy in every cell .",
    "otherwise we can expect maximal values in the transmitivitty but not perfect tunnelling .",
    "the difference in qbs energies of each cell can be used as an energy selector or filter ; showing perfect tunnelling only at one defined value of incident energy , and preventing the transmission in other energy values . to illustrate our proposal we consider a gaas quantum wire ( where the effective mass of electron is @xmath176 times the electron mass ) and locate two @xmath1-function potential barriers with equal strength ( @xmath177 ev ) .",
    "the transmitivitty as a function of incident energy in this case is shown in figure 4 a ) , in blue line when the potentials are located @xmath178 nm one to each other .",
    "the red line shows the transmitivitty when the potentials are separated by @xmath179 nm .",
    "as can be seen , both cases share a qbs energy at @xmath180 mev .",
    "now , we take these two cases and put them together in series separated by @xmath181 nm , to form a four-@xmath1-function potential array . in the figure 4",
    "b ) we show the transmitivity as a function of the incident energy in this four-@xmath1-function potential array .",
    "note that in this configuration the perfect tunnelling energy at @xmath180 mev is preserved , while the other maximum values disappear .",
    "in this example the two cells behave like potential barriers for incident energies different than qbs energies . considering the cells as potential barriers , the arbitrary separation between the two cells ( in the example @xmath181 nm ) can create resonances for different incident energies , but never perfect tunnelling , unless the two cells are equal , as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "conditions for resonant transmission are considered , in detail , for arrays with @xmath138 , @xmath51 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these results were applied to potential arrays with arbitrary @xmath0 , using a simple representation for the transmission matrix .",
    "the resonant behaviour is also the cause of the perfect tunnelling present in these systems . in this context",
    ", we calculate the transcendental relations for qbs energies in specific arrays , using the concept of intrinsic qbs energies . for arrays with arbitrary @xmath0",
    ", we propose the separation of the array into subsets or cells , whose qbs energies are related with the qbs energies of the whole system . using the relation between intrinsic qbs energies we showed how a energy filter works .",
