    "one of the most important questions to be addressed at the lhc is whether the physics that breaks electroweak symmetry is strongly or weakly coupled .",
    "precision electroweak data are in good agreement with the standard model with a light higgs boson , but mild cancellations may allow a good fit to precision electroweak data in strongly - coupled models .",
    "direct searches are essential to settle this question .",
    "one direct test of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking is of course the search for the higgs boson .",
    "however , even if a light higgs - like particle is discovered at the lhc , it is important to make sure that it is `` the '' higgs , namely the state that unitarizes @xmath7 scattering , where @xmath8 .",
    "there are other types of scalars that naturally have couplings to gauge bosons and fermions similar to higgs bosons even though they are not responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , for example radions @xcite and dilatons @xcite . in principle",
    "one can measure the couplings of the scalar to electroweak gauge bosons and compare with the values needed to unitarize @xmath7 scattering , but this requires very high integrated luminosity at lhc @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the standard higgs search does not lead to a discovery , it does not follow that electroweak symmetry breaking is strongly coupled .",
    "for example , there may be a light higgs with new physics modifying its decays , making higgs discovery difficult at lhc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to carry out direct searches for a strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking sector , independently of the status of the search for the higgs boson .",
    "the classic signal is strong @xmath7 scattering @xcite , which is directly related to the absence of a light higgs boson by unitarity .",
    "however , this also requires very high integrated luminosity at lhc @xcite .",
    "we argue that there is another generic signature in models with strong @xmath7 scattering : new @xmath9 states in the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1channels , with masses of order a tev .",
    "these states must couple to the top quark sufficiently strongly to change the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1cross sections by order 100% at energies of order tev .    the existence of such resonances is already expected in models where the top quark is composite ( as in `` topcolor '' models @xcite ) and extra dimensional models that are `` dual '' to strongly coupled theories with a composite top quark @xcite .",
    "we argue that such states also exist in models where the top quark is an elementary particle perturbatively coupled to a strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "these states give rise to new signatures that may provide a `` smoking gun '' for strong electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we focus on models where the top quark mass arises from coupling to an operator @xmath10 with the quantum numbers of a higgs doublet : [ thiggscoup ] @xmath11@xmath12 = |q_l t_r + @xmath13here @xmath14 is the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath10 above the tev scale , and @xmath15 is a mass scale that parameterizes the strength of the coupling . the dimensionless constant @xmath16 is chosen so that @xmath15 is the scale where this operator becomes strongly coupled ( see below ) .",
    "another possibility not discussed here is that the top quark couples to a fermionic operator with quantum numbers conjugate to the top itself @xcite . in order for the top to be weakly coupled to the electroweak breaking sector at the tev scale , we want @xmath14 to be as small as possible ,",
    "_ e.g. _  @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", naturalness requires that the operator @xmath18 be irrelevant , _",
    "i.e. _  its dimension is larger than @xmath19 .",
    "the possibility of models satisfying these requirements was pointed out in ref .",
    "rigorous inequalities on dimensions in conformal field theories allow this scenario @xcite .",
    "models based on qcd in the conformal window were described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic point is that the operator @xmath10 creates states in the strong sector , so eq .  ( [ thiggscoup ] ) couples the top quark to the strong sector . as we now show , this coupling is sufficiently strong to make an order 100% change in the scattering cross sections with initial states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for @xmath20 , where the electroweak symmetry breaking sector gets strong . for simplicity , we will discuss the electrically neutral @xmath21 channel below , but the same arguments apply to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels . for",
    "@xmath24 the chirality - violating top quark scattering cross section does not fall off at large energy @xcite : [ ttwwbelow ] @xmath25(|t_l t_r vv ) ~ .",
    "we now compare this to scattering amplitudes for @xmath26 . the leading contribution to",
    "the amplitude for chirality - violating top interactions involves an insertion of the interaction eq .",
    "( [ thiggscoup ] ) .",
    "the cross section for producing a state @xmath27 with mass of order @xmath28 is then of order [ ttabove ] @xmath25(|t_l t_r x ) ~ ( ) ^2(d-1 ) .",
    "the powers of @xmath29 in this result can be understood from the fact that in the limit @xmath30 the cross - section must be strongly coupled in the sense of `` nave dimensional analysis '' ( nda ) @xcite . to compare this with eq .",
    "( [ ttwwbelow ] ) we note that nda also gives m_t ~@xmath31_ew ( ) ^d-1 and @xmath32 , so the cross sections in eqs .",
    "( [ ttwwbelow ] ) and ( [ ttabove ] ) are comparable .",
    "we can also give an argument that does not rely on counting factors of @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath33 the energy dependence of the total chirality - violating cross section to create hadrons in the strongly coupled theory is fixed by scale invariance : @xmath25(|t_l t_r ) ~ ( ) ^2 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "this has a different energy dependence than at low energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ ttwwbelow ] ) ) .",
    "this means that the strong sector gives a correction to the cross section that is order 100% at the matching scale @xmath35 .",
    "this argument does not imply a large change in the cross section for @xmath36 , but the most phenomenologically interesting case is @xmath37 , as discussed above .",
    "the arguments above can be repeated for the chirality - violating channels @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which also get contributions from the operator eq .",
    "( [ thiggscoup ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the nature of the new states in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 channels at the tev scale .",
    "the most spectacular signals arise if these states include narrow resonances .",
    "nda suggests that resonances in a strongly - coupled theory with a scale @xmath28 will have mass of order @xmath28 and width of order @xmath40 , and will not be visible as individual resonances .",
    "however , our experience with qcd suggests resonances are present in strongly - coupled theories and are significantly narrower than the nda estimate . including the large-@xmath41 suppression of multi - meson couplings @xcite",
    ", nda gives .",
    "|_nda ~. this is for direct @xmath42-body decays , _ i.e. _  those without intermediate on - shell particles . in qcd",
    "we find much smaller widths @xcite : & & 0.2 , + [ qcd3decay ] & & 10 ^ -2 .",
    "the existence of narrow resonances is therefore plausible even in a strongly coupled theory without large @xmath41 .    because @xmath10 is a lorentz scalar , the resonances created by the interaction eq .",
    "( [ thiggscoup ] ) are spin @xmath43",
    ". the resonances will fall into representations of custodial isospin symmetry , required to avoid large corrections to the @xmath44 parameter . assuming the standard custodial symmetry breaking pattern @xmath45",
    ", the operator @xmath10 transforms as @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore expect isospin triplet and singlet states",
    ".    the mass of these states will be of order tev .",
    "the coupling to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for these resonances will be of order @xmath47 .",
    "this coupling allows production of these states at lhc .",
    "electrically neutral states can be produced via @xmath48 via a top loop , and electrically charged states can be produced via @xmath49 .",
    "the production rate for these states at the lhc is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "cross section for spin-0 resonance production at lhc via @xmath3 ( solid and dashed lines ) and @xmath50 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "we assume @xmath51 .",
    "cross sections are tree - level with no @xmath52 factor .",
    "scalar and pseudoscalar cross sections are nearly equal for the charged case , and are not shown separately . ]",
    "these resonances can decay to top quarks via @xmath53 or @xmath54 via the coupling eq .",
    "( [ thiggscoup ] ) .",
    "for @xmath55 we have = ~10 ^ -1 .",
    "these resonances also have strong decays to longitudinal @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s , which are equivalent to the nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath56 of the strong sector . in the absence of additional symmetries",
    ", isospin singlets will decay strongly to @xmath57 with a large width , similar to the tev standard model higgs .",
    "a spin-@xmath43 isospin triplet can not decay to @xmath57 , so the leading strong decay is generally @xmath58 .",
    "if the 3-body strong decay is direct , scaling from qcd gives @xmath59 , corresponding to a branching ratio of order 10% .",
    "observation of a direct 3-body decay with such a large branching ratio is a `` smoking gun '' for strong dynamics , since a perturbative 3-body decay would have @xmath60 due to 3-body phase space suppression .",
    "examination of the invariant mass distributions is required to exclude the possibility of a 2-body chain decay .",
    "other interesting possibilities can arise if the strong sector has additional discrete symmetries .",
    "as an example , we consider a strong @xmath61 gauge theory in which the operator @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ thiggscoup ] ) is a `` techniquark '' bilinear @xmath62 .",
    "the strong sector then preserves @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in which the lowest - lying resonances are expected to have the quantum numbers of techniquark bilinears .",
    "we can therefore classify the states by isospin , parity , and @xmath65-parity ( @xmath66 ) as in qcd .",
    "the operator @xmath10 has the decomposition i^pg",
    "= 0^++ 0 ^ -+ 1^+- 1^ so we may expect resonances in any of these channels .",
    "we emphasize that a theory of this type does not necessarily have qcd - like dynamics .",
    "for example the theory may have additional techniquarks that make the theory conformal above the tev scale @xcite .",
    "scalar resonances in qcd - like technicolor theories have been previously discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but not the crucial role of the top quark coupling in production .",
    "the @xmath67 resonance is the analog of the qcd @xmath68 .",
    "it has a 2-body strong decay to @xmath57 , and is therefore expected to be broad . here @xmath56 is the composite eaten nambu - goldstone boson that makes up the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath69 is the analog of the qcd @xmath70 , and we call it the @xmath71 .",
    "its most plausible strong decays are @xmath72 ( followed by @xmath73 ) or @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the spin-1 @xmath76 particle that is the analog of the qcd @xmath75 .",
    "the strong decay to @xmath77 can plausibly compete with the perturbative @xmath21 decay , especially if the @xmath78 decay is open , leading to interesting observable signals at the lhc .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath79 for the strong decay , we obtain a cross section for like - sign electrons or muons of order 1  fb for a tev resonance . in qcd",
    ", @xmath78 is kinematically forbidden , but if even if we scale up qcd the decay is allowed because ~10 ^ -1 .",
    "this scaling also gives @xmath80 , @xmath81 , giving a very small production cross section .",
    "however , this may be very misleading because the dynamics is not expected to be qcd - like .",
    "another interesting case is the @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "its plausible strong decays are @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( followed by @xmath86 ) .",
    "these possibilities correspond respectively either to a narrow resonance with a possibly significant branching ratio to @xmath58 , or a broad resonance decaying dominantly to @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the @xmath87 with quantum numbers @xmath88 has plausible strong decays @xmath89 ( followed by @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 ( followed by @xmath73 ) , and @xmath92 .",
    "the last two cases potentially give an observable rate for a @xmath93 final state !",
    "we have shown that the top quark coupling to strong electroweak symmetry breaking provides a production mechanism for tev - scale spin-0 resonances . we have argued that this is a generic signature for strong electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the processes @xmath94 and @xmath95 may give significant numbers of events at the lhc , and can result in the production of both narrow and broad resonances .",
    "( by comparison , @xmath96 scattering can only produce resonances with 2-body strong decays , which are therefore broad . )",
    "these resonances always have decays to third generation quarks via @xmath53 , @xmath97 , but may also have substantial branching fractions to multi-@xmath98 final states . whether or not these modes are observable at the lhc depends sensitively on their mass : as can be seen from fig .  1 , the production cross section drops by 3 orders of magnitude as the resonance mass varies from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "however , besides strong @xmath96 scattering this is the only generic signal for strong electroweak symmetry breaking observable at lhc , and should be pursued vigorously .",
    "we do not know the masses of the lightest resonances , so broad - based search strategies are required .",
