    "disks of dust and gas around young stars provide laboratories for studying the initial conditions of planet formation .",
    "a knowledge of disk temperature profiles at stellocentric radii @xmath0 au is crucial for understanding both terrestrial and giant planet formation .",
    "planet formation is only possible beyond the dust sublimation radius ( where temperatures are @xmath1 k ) , since dust is an essential building block of terrestrial planets and giant planet cores .",
    "the disk temperature profile also dictates the location of the `` snowline '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , beyond which temperatures are low enough for water ice formation .",
    "the snowline tells us where icy material originates , which is important for understanding how water - rich , earth - like planets come to be .",
    "furthermore , because the surface density in solids is higher at and beyond the snowline , giant planet formation is facilitated there .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to further constrain inner disk temperature profiles , spatially resolved observations at multiple wavelengths are necessary",
    "since dust ( and gas ) emission is temperature and wavelength dependent , different radial disk temperature profiles produce distinct spatial distributions of emission at different wavelengths .",
    "thus , measurements of emission intensity and size as a function of wavelength can be used to determine inner disk temperature profiles .",
    "spectrally dispersed interferometry observations also have the potential to probe the spatial distribution of spectral line emission relative to continuum emission .",
    "most of the mass in protoplanetary disks is contained in gas , which emits primarily through molecular and atomic transitions .",

    "we use these data to investigate the temperature profiles of disks at stellocentric radii less than 1 au .",

    "we derive crude spectra from the observed count rates in our pti data .",
    "we first normalize the photometry by dividing by the mean flux for all spectral channels , and then calibrate instrumental and atmospheric effects for this normalized photometry with the same stars used to calibrate the @xmath7 measurements .",
    "these main - sequence calibrator stars have spectral types ranging from f7 to a0 , and nearly flat near - ir spectra ( @xmath17 based on 2mass photometry ) . since most calibrators are not colorless a0v stars , the calibrated fluxes for the target stars may have some residual slopes .",
    "however , this does not appear to be a significant effect .",
    "figure [ fig : photcheck ] shows the fluxes for four of our target stars and one `` check star , '' all calibrated with the same set of calibrators .",

    "thus , our differential spectral calibration appears reliable to within @xmath19 .",
    "we estimate ( conservatively ) that relative ( channel - to - channel ) fluxes for our target objects have uncertainties of 20% .",
    "if we remove the continuum slopes of our targets , no significant flux variations are observed above the estimated 20% uncertainties .",
    "one of our sample objects , mwc 1080 , has a nearby companion with @xmath20 separation and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "since we do not know the color of the companion star across the @xmath2 band , we do not attempt to subtract contributions of the companion from our flux and @xmath7 data . given the flux ratio of the two stars this may introduce additional uncertainties of @xmath19 in the modeling for this source .",
    "none of our other targets have known companions which would influence the visibility data at the few percent level @xcite .",

    "finally we compute broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for our best - fit models and compare these to observed seds from the literature in  [ sec : seds ] .      in order to model the circumstellar emission , we must first estimate the contribution to the measured fluxes and @xmath7 from the unresolved central stars .",
    "following previous investigators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use spectral decomposition to estimate the relative fluxes of the unresolved star and the circumstellar excess .",
    "we determine the stellar flux for our sample objects by fitting a blackbody to optical photometry ( from the literature ; see eisner et al .",
    "2004 ) , and then extrapolating to the @xmath2-band .",
    "the excess flux is given by the difference between the observed flux and the estimated stellar flux .",
    "to convert the normalized 2.02.4 @xmath4 m fluxes in each channel (  [ sec : obs ] ) into absolute flux units , we use continuum @xmath2-band photometric flux measurements from @xcite . derived circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios for each spectral channel are listed in table [ tab : fratios ] . because the stellar flux declines precipitously with wavelength while the excess flux increases with wavelength , the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio increases steeply across the @xmath2-band",
    "as discussed in @xcite , uncertainties in the @xmath2-band photometric measurements and uncertainties in optical photometry lead to errors in the estimated circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios of @xmath2220% .",
    "in addition , uncertainties in the channel - to - channel flux measurements (  [ sec : obs ] ) introduce errors in the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios of @xmath2220% . while many of our sample objects are variable at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the photometric k - band measurements were nearly contemporaneous with our pti observations , and thus source variability should not be a major source of uncertainty .",
    "thus the total uncertainties in estimated circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios are @xmath2330% .",
    "these uncertainties lead to small errors in the fitted angular sizes because the near - ir emission from our sample is dominated by the circumstellar component ; typical uncertainties on fitted parameters are a few percent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "before considering the complete dataset , which consists of @xmath7 and fluxes measured in 5 spectral channels from 2.0 to 2.4 @xmath4 m , we provide an estimate of angular size as measured in each spectral channel .",
    "we employ a simple model for the circumstellar excess emission , and fit this model to the @xmath7 measured in each spectral channel .",
    "each source was observed multiple times over multiple baselines , and we fit all of the @xmath7 measurements in a given channel simultaneously .",
    "our chosen model is a uniform ring of fixed fractional width .",
    "the normalized @xmath7 of a ring , viewed face - on , is given by @xmath24 \\pi \\theta_{\\rm in } r_{\\rm uv}}{\\lambda}\\right ) -   j_1\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\theta_{\\rm in } r_{\\rm uv}}{\\lambda}\\right )   \\right\\ } \\right)^2 , \\label{eq : ring}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the inner angular radius of the ring , @xmath26 is the ratio of the outer ring radius to the inner ring radius , @xmath27 is the `` uv radius , '' @xmath28 are the projected baseline lengths on the sky , and @xmath29 is a first - order bessel function .",
    "we take @xmath30 for all objects .",
    "the only free parameter in the model is @xmath31 .",
    "inclined geometries are included in this model , and in those discussed below , using a transformation to a circularly symmetric coordinate system ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume values for the inclination and position angle based on previous modeling of the broadband @xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "we verified that these values were reasonable for the spectrally dispersed data by fitting ring models where inclination and position angle ( in addition to @xmath31 ) were free parameters . for all objects , the best - fit position angles and inclinations were consistent within the 1@xmath32 uncertainties across the 5 spectral channels .",
    "furthermore , these values were compatible with those derived previously from wide - band @xmath7 measurements @xcite .",
    "we therefore fix the inclinations and position angles in the modeling presented here .",
    "fitted inner ring radii as functions of wavelength are shown in figure [ fig : sizes ] .",
    "we also indicate the corresponding linear radii computed using the distances assumed in @xcite . clearly , size increases with wavelength for most objects . such behavior is expected for irradiated disks and/or accretion disks , where the temperature decreases with increasing stellocentric radius .",
    "it is not consistent with a single - temperature ring at fixed radius , since the angular size of such a ring is independent of wavelength . for several objects",
    ", the inferred sizes are not obviously increasing with wavelength .",
    "rather , the size of the circumstellar emission is independent of @xmath33 within uncertainties ( e.g. , v1295 aql ) , or is not a monotonic function ( e.g. , v1685 cyg ) .",
    "to quantitatively investigate the radial temperature structure suggested by figure [ fig : sizes ] , in this section we fit simple models to our @xmath7 and photometry data for all spectral channels simultaneously .",
    "here we assume that the models emit only continuum emission ; in  [ sec : models ] we investigate whether better fits are obtained when spectral line emission is included .",
    "for all models we fit only our @xmath7 and flux data measured from 2.02.4 @xmath4 m ; in  [ sec : seds ] we compute the broadband seds predicted by our best - fit models and compare to observations .",
    "we first consider the uniform ring model discussed above , but now fit the model to the complete dataset all at once ( instead of fitting each channel individually ) . in addition",
    ", we now consider the measured fluxes as well as @xmath7 .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of a ring temperature , @xmath34 , in order to fit the photometry data .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the ring emits as a blackbody , the flux emitted by the ring is @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the planck function , @xmath37 is the distance , and @xmath38 is the inclination of the ring ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 are assigned from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we determine the values of @xmath39 and @xmath34 that provide the best fit to all of the measured @xmath7 and fluxes for a given source ( table [ tab : rings ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the reduced @xmath40 values of our best - fit ring models are @xmath15 ( table [ tab : rings ] ) , since the ring model produces the same size in each channel , contrary to what is observed in the data ( see  [ sec : rings ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the poorness of fit with an example in figure [ fig : abaur - ring ] , which shows the measured @xmath7 along with the prediction of the best - fit single - temperature ring model for ab aur . while @xmath41 is not far from unity for several objects , this is probably because of large measurement errors and",
    "does not necessarily imply that the single - temperature ring model provides a good physical description of the data .",
    "the dependence of source angular size on wavelength suggests that we should include temperature - dependent radial gradients in the models .",
    "while a single - temperature ring model possesses no such gradients , the addition of a second ring at different stellocentric radius and temperature will lead to observed source structure that is a function of wavelength . specifically , the cooler , outer ring will contribute relatively more emission at longer wavelengths , and thus the angular size of the two - ring model will tend to increase with wavelength .",
    "we assume the rings have fractional widths of 0.2 , and we fix the radius of the inner ring at 0.1 au .",
    "so long as the inner ring is essentially unresolved by our observations , the exact choice of inner ring radius will not substantially alter the quality of the fits .",
    "we verified this by performing fits where the inner ring radius was left as a free parameter ; reduced @xmath40 values did not improve with this extra degree of freedom .",
    "smaller assumed values of the inner ring radius will , however , yield higher inner ring temperatures .",
    "conversely , larger values of the inner ring radius give lower inner ring temperatures .",
    "however substantially larger inner ring radii can be ruled out since they would be spatially resolved , and would thus lower the quality of the fits .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the temperature of the inner ring , and the radius and temperature of the outer ring .",
    "this is obviously a simple description of a potentially complex system , but will demonstrate whether a multi - component continuum model is suitable for explaining our data .",
    "as above , the data fitted include @xmath7 and fluxes measured from 2.02.4 @xmath4 m (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 values predicted by best - fit two - ring models are shown in figure [ fig : modfits ] .",
    "best - fit parameters and reduced @xmath40 values are listed in table [ tab : tworings ] . for objects that display a monotonic increase in size with wavelength ( see figure [ fig : sizes ] ) the reduced @xmath40 values for this model are lower than for the single ring model (  [ sec : modring ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for t ori , v1295 aql , v1685 cyg , and as 442 , sources for which the size does not appear to increase with wavelength , the single - temperature ring model provides a lower reduced @xmath40 .",
    "the high temperature of the inner ring for mwc 1080 is due to our assumed inner ring radius of 0.1 au .",
    "a larger inner ring radius  which would lead to a lower fitted inner ring temperature  is compatible with our data ; at the source distance ( @xmath42 kpc ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an inner ring radius as large as @xmath43 au would still produce unresolved emission as assumed in our model .      as a generalization of the two - ring model (  [ sec : mod2rings ] ) , we construct a disk model with a continuous temperature gradient .",
    "if the temperature decreases over a range of disk radii then the cooler material at larger radii may contribute relatively more emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "we consider a disk model with a power - law temperature profile , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the stellocentric radius , @xmath39 is the inner radius of the disk , and @xmath46 is the temperature at @xmath47 .",
    "the model is described by three free parameters : @xmath39 , @xmath46 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we assume the model extends from @xmath39 to an outer radius @xmath49 au .",
    "the exact choice of @xmath50 is not crucial since most of the 2 @xmath4 m emission arises from sub - au radii .",
    "however if @xmath50 is @xmath51 au then the model will not produce substantially different angular sizes at different radii ; rather the emission would appear to arise from a narrow ring at all wavelengths and the model would resemble the single - temperature ring model described in  [ sec : modring ] . to explain the dependence of angular size on wavelength , we require @xmath52 au .    we divide the disk up into annuli and compute the flux and visibilities for each annulus .",
    "we assume each annulus emits as a blackbody so that the flux in an annulus of infinitesimal width @xmath53 ( observed at the earth ) is @xmath54 where @xmath36 is the planck function , @xmath37 is the distance , and @xmath38 is the disk inclination .",
    "the normalized visibilities for an annulus extending from @xmath55 to @xmath56 are given by the difference of visibilities for uniform disks having radii equal to @xmath55 and @xmath57 : @xmath58.\\ ] ] the sum of @xmath59 over all annuli gives the total disk flux , @xmath60 .",
    "the square of the flux - weighted sum of @xmath61 over all annuli gives @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath7 values predicted by best - fit models including a temperature gradient in the inner disk are shown in figure [ fig : modfits ] .",
    "table [ tab : results ] shows that the reduced @xmath40 values of the best fits are generally @xmath62 .",
    "for all objects except v1295 aql and v1685 cyg this model provides a better fit ( i.e. , a lower reduced @xmath40 value ) than the single - temperature ring model . moreover",
    ", the temperature gradient model yields a better fit to the data than the two - ring model for all sources .",
    "thus , our spectrally dispersed interferometry data favor disk models that incorporate radial temperature gradients .",
    "how well the temperature gradient model fits broadband seds compared to other models is discussed in  [ sec : seds ] .    for most sources the inner disk sizes and temperatures derived here are similar to those inferred by @xcite from broadband ( 2.02.4 @xmath4 m ) @xmath7 measurements",
    "this is expected since the broadband @xmath7 measurements from @xcite have similar values to the spectrally dispersed measurements presented here .",
    "however , for objects with small best - fit @xmath48 values ( e.g. , mwc 758 or cq tau ) , our determined inner radii are smaller than the previous estimates by @xmath63 .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that @xcite assumed @xmath64 for their disk models ; for the smaller @xmath48 values inferred here , the inner edge of the disk must extend further inward to match the data .",
    "the values of @xmath39 determined here are more reliable than previous estimates since @xmath48 and @xmath39 have been determined simultaneously .",
    "while disk models including only continuum emission can provide reasonable fits to our spectrally dispersed interferometry data , several objects ",
    "t ori , v1295 aql , v1685 cyg , and as 442do not show the monotonic increase of size with wavelength expected for the continuum models with temperature gradients (   [ sec : mod2rings][sec : moddisk ] ) .",
    "this is particularly striking for v1685 cyg , where the smaller uncertainties strongly imply non - monotonic dependence of size on wavelength ( see figure [ fig : sizes ] ) .",
    "one potential explanation is that gaseous emission , with a different spatial scale than the dust continuum , contributes to the visibilities in certain spectral channels .",
    "based on compilations of h@xmath65o and co emission lines from the hitran database @xcite , gaseous spectral line emission , if present , contributes principally to the pti measurements in the channels centered at 2.0 , 2.3 , and 2.4 @xmath4 m ( figure [ fig : hitran ] ) .",
    "previous observations of hot gas near a young star illustrate that gaseous emission features may be quite broad @xcite , and thus this emission might fill large parts of some spectral channels .",
    "if the dust and gas emission components have different spatial distributions , then the visibilities in spectral channels where gaseous emission is important ( 2.0 .",
    "2.3 , and 2.4 @xmath4 m ) may be offset from the visibilities in spectral channels dominated by dust continuum emission ( 2.1 and 2.2 @xmath4 m ) .",
    "this effect has been observed previously in evolved late - type stars , where molecular layers above the stellar photosphere lead to different measured sizes across the @xmath2-band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate whether gaseous emission is contributing to our measured visibilities , we fit the models discussed above to only the visibilities measured from 2.1 to 2.2 @xmath4 m , and compare these fits to those using the data from all channels .",
    "best - fit parameters for `` continuum''-only fits ( i.e. , fits using only the data measured from 2.1 to 2.2 @xmath4 m ) are included in table [ tab : results ] , and the predicted @xmath7 values are plotted in figure [ fig : modfits ] .",
    "for all sources , the best - fit inner disk sizes for `` continuum '' channels only and for all channels are equal within the 1@xmath32 uncertainties . while the reduced @xmath40 values of the `` continuum''-only fits are smaller for ab aur , t ori , vv ser , as 442 , and mwc 1080 ( table [ tab : results ] ) , the differences are small for all sources except ab aur .",
    "the incompatibility of a simple disk model with the observed size versus wavelength for v1685 cyg was our main impetus for investigating gaseous emission .",
    "however , even if we consider only channels that are not expected to be contaminated by gaseous emission , the data are still not fitted well by our disk models ( note the large @xmath66 values in table [ tab : results ] ) ; the circumstellar emission for this object may not be represented well by a pure disk model .",
    "the spectrally dispersed interferometry data presented here do not argue strongly for the presence of gaseous spectral line emission in the inner disks around our sample haebe stars .",
    "we also do not observe any strong gaseous emission features in our crude spectra ( e.g. , figure [ fig : photcheck ] ) .",
    "however the large uncertainties do not rule out gaseous spectral line emission with line - to - continuum ratios @xmath67% .",
    "furthermore , the smaller @xmath66 values of continuum - only fits for several objects ( especially ab aur ) are intriguing .",
    "we fitted the models described above to measured @xmath7 and fluxes measured from 2.02.4 @xmath4 m .",
    "we now compare the broadband fluxes predicted by our best - fit models to observed seds .",
    "this comparison is motivated by previous analyses of seds and @xmath2-band interferometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which showed that single - temperature ring models generally provided better fits to the data than disks with temperature gradients .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows the predicted and observed seds for our sample .",
    "disk models incorporating smooth temperature gradients do not fit the sed data as well as the two other models for almost all objects ; the seds are fitted better by single - temperature ring models or by two - ring models .",
    "one exception is mwc 1080 , for which a disk model fits the sed data well ; for this source the two - ring model does not fit the sed well ( figure [ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous arguments that early - type stars like mwc 1080 are surrounded by geometrically thin disks with temperature gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the size of the near - ir emission for most of our objects varies as a function of wavelength , indicating that a simple , single - temperature ring model for the emission is untenable ; such a model predicts the same size regardless of observing wavelength .",
    "we showed above that the @xmath7 and flux data measured from 2.02.4 @xmath4 m are fitted better by models incorporating radial temperature gradients .",
    "early puffed - up inner disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generally assumed that the inner wall emits as a single - temperature blackbody ; this model resembled a single - temperature ring . even if temperature gradients within the puffed - up inner rim are included ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the narrow range of radii over which the emission arises means that these models still resemble single - temperature rings .",
    "our data therefore suggest that puffed - up inner rims alone do not fully represent the circumstellar emission from haebe sources .",
    "temperature gradients over a range of disk radii must be included in the model to fit the observational data presented here .",
    "the best fits to our spectrally - dispersed interferometry are obtained for two - ring models or models with power - law disk temperature profiles .",
    "comparison of our models with broadband seds suggests that two - ring models are preferable .",
    "we suggest that our two - ring model represents a puffed - up edge of the dust disk and hotter inner disk gas .",
    "the best - fit temperatures of the inner ring are substantially hotter than the dust sublimation temperature , supporting our hypothesis that such emission probably traces gas .",
    "the outer rings have temperatures less than or comparable to the dust sublimation temperature , suggesting that the outer ring emission can arise from dust .",
    "if inner disk / ring temperatures larger than dust sublimation temperatures reflect contributions from hot gas emission to measured fluxes and @xmath7 , we might also expect to detect variations in the visibilities as a function of wavelength due to gaseous co or h@xmath65o emission features .",
    "in general , no such trends are seen in our data (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the gaseous emission features are so broad that they produce a `` pseudo - continuum '' ; there is some support for this suggestion from previous observations of broad gaseous emission features from a young star @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that for ab aur , as 442 , and mwc 1080 , objects with higher inner disk temperatures , there is a suggestion that the inclusion of gaseous emission features in the models would improve the fits to the observations , since the `` continuum''-only models yield lower reduced @xmath40 values than the fits where all the data is used (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "future observations with better spectral resolution are needed to probe potential spectral line emission in more detail .    while a two - ring model provides the best match to the combination of spectrally dispersed and sed data , a disk model with a radial temperature gradient provides the best fit to the spectrally dispersed interferometry data ( from 2.02.4 @xmath4 m ) for all sources .",
    "our results suggest that a multi - component model that includes temperature gradients in one or more components may provide better fits to the data than the simple models considered here .",
    "we note that mwc 1080 , the most massive star in our sample , provides an exception : disk models with smooth temperature gradients fit all of the data well .",
    "we discern a striking correlation between temperature gradient and effective temperature of the host star @xmath68 , which may reflect relative differences in the dust / gas components or variations in the gradients within individual components . using our power - law disk model , @xmath69 , to illustrate this trend , we plot @xmath48 as a function of @xmath68 in figure [ fig : alphas ] .",
    "larger values of @xmath48 ( steeper gradients ) are associated with objects with earlier spectral types . for mwc 480 , mwc 758 , cq tau , and t ori , the objects in our sample with the latest spectral types , the best - fit models require @xmath70 0.400.55 .",
    "in contrast , inferred values of @xmath48 for other objects in our sample range between 0.60 and 1.0 .",
    "there is some degeneracy between temperature profiles and optical depth profiles . in our modeling",
    "we assumed the emission was optically thick .",
    "the fitted inner disk and ring temperatures may be underestimated to the extent that the optical depth of the emitting region , @xmath71 , is @xmath72 . by the same token , radial gradients in @xmath71",
    "are somewhat degenerate with temperature gradients . however , since @xmath73 is likely to decrease with increasing radius and wavelength ( e.g. , @xmath74 for the surface layers of geometrically thin disks ; chiang & goldreich 1997 ) , @xmath71 gradients are more likely to produce larger sizes at shorter wavelengths ( since more material at larger radii becomes optically thick ) .",
    "the gradients inferred from our data are therefore likely tracing temperature profiles as opposed to optical depth profiles .",
    "we presented near - ir interferometry data , spectrally dispersed across 5 channels from 2.0 to 2.4 @xmath4 m , from the palomar testbed interferometer .",
    "these data were used to constrain the temperature profiles of sub - au - sized regions of 11 herbig ae / be disks .",
    "we found that a single - temperature ring of emission did not fit the spectrally dispersed data well .",
    "two rings at different stellocentric radii and with different temperatures provide better fits to the data .",
    "the best fits ( i.e. , yielding the lowest reduced @xmath40 values ) are for disk models incorporating smooth radial temperature gradients .",
    "however , the smooth gradient disk models do not match broadband seds nearly as well as two - ring models .",
    "we therefore speculate that multiple emission components , probably dust and gas , at different temperatures and stellocentric radii are contributing to the observed data .",
    "more complex two - component models , including temperature gradients in one or both components , will better match the observations .",
    "the inferred temperature profiles are systematically shallower for disks around less massive stars .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this indicates relative differences in the properties of the two components ( gas and dust ) as a function of spectral type , or whether this trend traces temperature gradients within a single component .",
    "we also investigated whether gaseous emission , potentially at different spatial scales than the dust emission , contributes spectral line flux to our measurements . because co and h@xmath65o are expected to emit primarily in the edge channels of our spectrally dispersed measurements , we performed fits of our disk models to only the central channels .",
    "some objects showed a slight reduction ( and in the case of ab aur , a substantial reduction ) in the reduced @xmath40 values of the best - fit models when only the central channels were used .",
    "however , the best - fit parameters for fits to the central channels and those for fits to all data are consistent within the 1@xmath32 uncertainties for all objects .",
    "we are therefore unable to claim strong evidence for spectral line emission in the inner disks of our sample based on our current data .",
    "given the evidence for hot inner disk continuum emission , future observations with better spectral resolution and sensitivity are warranted to further investigate inner disk gas in these objects .",
