    "recently metzner and vollhardt@xcite showed that the fermionic many - body problem simplifies in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0 limit is taken in such a fashion that the dynamics are local in space , and the lattice problem can be mapped onto a self - consistently embedded anderson impurity model .",
    "the self energy and irreducible vertex functions of the impurity problem are employed to determine the green s functions and susceptibilities of the infinite - dimensional lattice .",
    "this many - body problem can essentially be solved exactly by using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques of hirsch and fye@xcite to extract the self energy and irreducible vertex functions of the relevant impurity problem .",
    "a variety of models have already been examined in this fashion : the hubbard model@xcite ; periodic anderson model@xcite ; and the holstein model@xcite .",
    "the infinite - dimensional limit provides a unique testing ground for various approximation techniques , since one can compare them to the benchmark qmc results .",
    "previous work has concentrated on the strong - coupling limit@xcite ( perturbation theory in the kinetic energy ) which can be shown to be an excellent approximation in the region of moderate to strong coupling .",
    "calculations in the weak - coupling limit are not under as good control .",
    "the main emphasis so far has been on conserving approximations@xcite ( such as the fluctuation - exchange approximation ) to the many - body problem .",
    "conserving approximations are popular because they satisfy the requisite conservation laws for electronic charge , energy , and momentum@xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that conserving approximations suffer from some serious flaws : ( 1 ) truncated approximations ( thru fourth order ) do not show a turnover in @xmath1 as the strong - coupling regime is approached ; ( 2 ) infinite summations of certain classes of diagrams can produce a turnover in @xmath1 , but the self energy is overestimated , and many - body features ( such as the upper and lower hubbard bands ) do not appear in the single - particle spectral function .",
    "similar deficiencies where found by white in his examination of the anderson impurity model itself@xcite .",
    "an alternate approximation scheme , that does not suffer from the above problems ( but is not conserving ) , has been introduced by georges and kotliar@xcite and is known as iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) . in this case , the perturbation theory is strictly truncated at a finite order ( as opposed to a conserving approximation that sums the infinite class of diagrams corresponding to self energy insertions into the dressed green s function ) .",
    "the motivation for this approximation comes from the pioneering work of yosida and yamada@xcite , who found that truncated perturbation theory was an extremely accurate approximation for the anderson impurity model because the sum total of all classes of diagrams at a given order is an order of magnitude smaller than any of its constituent parts .",
    "this remarkable near cancellation of diagrams was further verified to high order by zlati and horvati@xcite who found that the exact bethe ansatz solutions can be rearranged into a power series whose coefficients die off rapidly .",
    "horvati and zlati@xcite generalized yosida and yamada s analysis off of half filling and found that the strictly truncated perturbation series was also accurate in the doped case .",
    "however , anomalous behavior begins to enter if the coupling strength is increased too far and the electron concentration is close to half filling .",
    "ferrer , martn - rodero , and flores@xcite realized that the reason why the perturbation theory fails more rapidly away from half filling is because the second - order perturbation theory correctly reproduces the atomic limit at half - filling , but not away from half filling .",
    "they proposed an _",
    "ad hoc _ interpolation scheme that properly reproduces the atomic limit everywhere and removes some of the anomalous behavior of the horvati and zlati approximation .",
    "an alternate interpolation scheme has been proposed by neal@xcite based upon functional integral techniques which appears to be quite accurate for all values of the interaction strength but is restricted to half filling .    in this contribution",

    "the odd - order contributions to the self energy all vanish and each of the fourth - order contributions on a given line in figure 8 are identical@xcite . since the self - energy is an even function of @xmath20 at half - filling , but the irreducible vertex function contains both even and odd powers of @xmath20 , the only difference between a truncated approximation of order @xmath94 and of order @xmath95 is that the irreducible vertex function is larger for the odd - order approximation .",

    "the total of all of the fourth - order diagrams is plotted with the solid line .",
    "one can see that the remarkable near cancellation of the fourth - order diagrams still holds in infinite - dimensions , and in this case the fourth - order contribution is the same sign , but more than an order of magnitude smaller than the flex contribution at fourth order .    a comparison of the different approximation schemes versus the exact qmc results are given in figures 1012 for three different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the second - order and third - order approximations employ an energy cutoff of 256 positive matsubara frequencies ; the fourth - order approximation uses 64 positive matsubara frequencies . in figure 10  ( a ) the self - energy renormalization function",
    "is plotted for the two different approximations at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that the fourth - order approximation virtually reproduces the qmc results . in figure 10  ( b )",
    "the even component of one row of the irreducible vertex function for the cdw channel are compared for @xmath96 in the ipt approximation .",
    "all of the approximations are in reasonable agreement with the qmc results , but the accuracy is significantly reduced relative to what was found for the self energy . the ipt@xmath66 approximation is compared to the qmc results in figure 10  ( c ) .",
    "these results are similar to the ipt approximation , but perhaps not as accurate .    as the coupling strength",
    "is increased to @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) the self energy is becoming bracketed by the two low - order approximations , with the fourth - order approximation overestimating the self energy , and the second - order approximation underestimating the self energy , as shown in figure 11  ( a ) .",
    "the cdw vertex is plotted in figure 11  ( b ) for the ipt approximation .",
    "one can see strong - coupling effects beginning to enter as the qmc vertex becomes more attractive at low frequency transfer than predicted by the even - order approximations .",
    "the third - order ipt approximation is producing the correct qualitative shape of the vertex , but it is overestimating the magnitude by a large amount . the ipt@xmath66 approximation is shown in figure 11  ( c ) . here",
    "the two different methods for calculating the vertex yield quite different results . in the ipt@xmath66 approximation",
    ", all orders are showing a weakening of the vertex at lower frequencies , which is not present in the qmc data .    finally , at a rather strong value of the coupling @xmath100 , @xmath101 , where the transition temperature reaches its maximal value , the self energy is still reproduced quite accurately by both orders of the ipt [ see figure 12  ( a ) ] .",
    "the vertices are , however , quite poorly approximated . in figure 12  ( b ) and 12  ( c )",
    "the results for the ipt and ipt@xmath66 respectively are presented .",
    "the qmc vertex is becoming strongly attractive here .",
    "only the third - order ipt approximation has the correct qualitative behavior , but it overestimates the magnitude of the vertex .",
    "the ipt@xmath66 approximation produces a fairly flat frequency dependence to the vertex which is quite accurate at all but the lowest frequency transfers ( where it is almost an order of magnitude too small ) .",
    "the conclusion that we can draw from this comparison of the self energy and irreducible vertex functions is that the ipt approximation is quite accurate for the self energy , but is a rather poor approximation for the irreducible vertex function .",
    "it is known that the reason why the ipt is so accurate for the self energy arises from the fact that it properly reproduces the atomic limit@xcite , but it is possible that it does not produce the atomic limit for the irreducible vertex functions .",
    "if this were the case , one could try another _ ad hoc _ interpolation scheme that interpolates between the perturbative result for the vertex , and the atomic limit , to provide a more accurate approximation .",
    "note also that since the self energy is reproduced quite accurately by the ipt , but the magnitude of the vertex is grossly underestimated , the transition temperature will drop too rapidly in the strong - coupling regime ( with the exception of the third - order ipt approximation where the transition temperature will grow too rapidly ) .",
    "this is illustrated by plotting the transition temperature for the cdw transition at half - filling in the attractive hubbard model as a function of @xmath20 ( figure 13 ) and comparing to the qmc solution@xcite . in the ipt approximation [ fig.13  ( a ) ] ,",
    "the peak in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath20 is properly reproduced for the even - order approximations , but not for the odd - order one .",
    "the transition temperature decreases too rapidly in the strong - coupling regime because of the underestimation of the vertex . in the ipt@xmath66 approximation [ fig .",
    "13  ( b ) ] , all orders have a peak in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "the third - order approximation is the most accurate here , because it has the most attractive vertex , but even in this case the quantitative agreement with the qmc is not as good as was found for the truncated conserving approximations@xcite , where the transition temperature did not have a peak , but the underestimation of the self - energy compensated for the underestimation of the vertex to produce reasonably accurate transition temperatures into the strong - coupling regime .    the doping dependence of the sc transition temperature is plotted in figure 14 for both the second and third order ipt and ipt@xmath66 approximations and @xmath96 . even at this weak a value of the coupling strength ,",
    "the second - order ipt and ipt@xmath66 approximations show the anomalous behavior of an increase in @xmath1 for small dopings off of half filling .",
    "a third - order approximation works much better ( because third - order contributions to the self energy enter when the electron concentration is not equal to 1 ) , and does not display the anomalous behavior ( at this value of @xmath20 ) .",
    "once again , the ipt@xmath66 approximation is more robust against the anomaly in @xmath1 , but all ipt approximations quickly fail as the coupling strength increases beyond @xmath96 ( because they fail at half filling as shown in fig .",
    "the iterated perturbation theory approximation@xcite has been applied to the attractive holstein and hubbard models in infinite dimensions .",
    "this weak coupling theory is not a conserving approximation because it corresponds to a strictly truncated perturbation series for the self energy .",
    "the vertex functions are either approximated with a strictly truncated perturbation series too ( ipt ) , or with a truncated perturbation series that includes all self energy insertions ( ipt@xmath66 ) .    at half filling , these approximate theories are accurate in reproducing the electronic self energy ( for the holstein model , the accuracy increases as the phonon frequency increases ) but do not reproduce the correct behavior of the irreducible vertex functions in the strong - coupling regime .    in particular , for the half - filled hubbard model , the ipt is a very accurate approximation for the self energy of the hubbard model , but is a poor approximation for the irreducible vertex functions a low frequency transfer . as a result",
    ", the transition temperature does in general display a peak ( because of the large self - energy renormalizations ) , but decreases too rapidly in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the ipt is a much less accurate approximation for the self energy of the holstein model at finite phonon frequency ( indicating the importance of higher - order diagrams ) .",
    "the ipt is also a poor approximation for the vertex functions , but , remarkably , the transition temperatures are quite accurately approximated both at half filling and off of half filling ( for small enough coupling strength ) .",
    "the peak position and height of @xmath1 at half filling are reproduced well , as is the doping dependence of @xmath1 up to the region of parameter space where a double - well structure begins to develop in the effective phonon potential .",
    "as both of these systems are doped away from half filling , the transition temperatures ( to either a cdw or a sc ) display the anomalous behavior of initially _ increasing _ with doping .",
    "this anomalous behavior first enters at some critical value of the coupling , and becomes worse as the coupling strength is increased . for the holstein model ( with @xmath102 )",
    "this critical coupling lies near @xmath103 , whereas for the hubbard model it occurs at @xmath104 .",
    "third - order diagrams tend to push this anomaly out to larger values of interaction strength as expected because the third - order contributions to the self energy can be large as the system is doped off of half filling .    as a final summary ,",
    "the ipt is a highly accurate approximation for the self energy when the interaction is instantaneous , but generally underestimates the magnitude of the vertex functions at low frequency transfer ; it does not approximate the transition temperature well in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the ipt is a less accurate approximation for both the self energy and vertices for retarded interactions , but is much more accurate in determining transition temperatures because the errors in the self energy and the vertices tend to cancel in the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "the the explanation for this behavior is that the ipt is an accurate approximation when third - order terms can be neglected .",
    "this occurs for the self energy of the hubbard model at half filling , but is not true for the self energy when the interaction is retarded or the filling is different from 1 , or for the irreducible vertex functions .",
    "qualitatively the ipt approximation is better than the same order conserving approximation@xcite for the self energy of the hubbard model , but the transition temperatures are better approximated ( quantitatively ) by the conserving approximation . for the holstein model ,",
    "the ipt is superior to the conserving approximation in all aspects except for the anomalous behavior in @xmath1 near half filling and for large enough coupling strength .",
