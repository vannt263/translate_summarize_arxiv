    "spectroscopic indices are a measure of the strength of an absorption or emission feature , usually reported as the magnitude difference between the integrated flux in the region of the feature in question ( the  science band  ) and one or two nearby continuum regions ( the  comparison bands  )",
    ". indices and narrow - band photometry have a long history of usefulness in terms of physical information returned per time spent observing .",
    "they can be used to study a wide range of stellar properties : ca ii h&k surveys quickly identify extremely metal - poor stars ( e.g. , beers et al 1985 , 1999 ) , the mg i index is an indicator of surface gravity in cool stars ( e.g. , morrison et al . 2000 ) , and balmer indices are diagnostics of stellar age and metallicity when seen in galaxy spectra ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "because they require far less observing time than high - resolution spectroscopy , the telescope - limited astronomer frequently uses these low - resolution methods in a first pass to identify interesting objects to be followed up later in more detail .",
    "narrow - band colors are often used to calculate physical quantities : an empirical calibration can be established between the observed quantities and the intrinsic properties in a well - studied sample , and that calibration can then be applied to derive the intrinsic properties of a much larger set of stars , as long as the stars in the larger set are similar enough in temperature , gravity , and composition to the well - studied calibration sample . the @xcite photometric temperature calibration is a well - known example of this process .",
    "the observables can also be used directly as proxies ; for example , ddo and strmgren colors , which are known to correlate with temperature , metallicity , and surface gravity , can be used for dwarf / giant separation , or to do rough sorting by metallicity ( e.g. , grundahl et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the so - called lick indices can be measured from integrated spectra of galaxies , and provide information about unresolved stellar populations ( e.g. , worthey 2004 ) .",
    "molecular bandstrength indices measured from low- or moderate - resolution spectroscopy are often the end result themselves : comparing cn versus ch bandstrengths of globular cluster red giants , one finds that ch bandstrength falls with rising luminosity @xcite ( the same is true in the halo field : see gratton et al .",
    "2000 ) , while at a given luminosity the ch - weaker ( and therefore lower carbon ) stars tend to have the stronger cn bands , and therefore must be nitrogen - enhanced .",
    "these trends imply that red giant atmospheres must be experiencing ongoing cn(o)-cycle processing ( e.g. , mcclure & norris 1977 , shetrone et al .",
    "much research into the behavior of c and n elemental abundances in globular cluster red giants ( e.g. , briley & cohen 2001 , norris et al . 1984 , norris & zinn 1977 , zinn 1973 ) has relied heavily on the use of the 4300 @xmath0 ch bandstrength for [ c / fe ] determination .",
    "this is true of population ii field giants as well ( e.g. , rossi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , there has been little uniformity in the ch indices used by various researchers .",
    "some g - band indices that have been used to date are @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3 which was defined for use with the low - metallicity globular cluster m53 ( [ fe / h]=-1.84 ) ;    @xmath4 @xcite : @xmath5 which was defined for use with the moderate - metallicity globular cluster m13 ( [ fe / h]=-1.54 ) ;    @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath7 which was defined for use with red giants in metal - poor globular clusters m92 and m15 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) ;    @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 defined for a study of carbon - enhanced metal - poor field stars ;    and @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12 which was defined for use with main - sequence stars of the globular cluster 47 tucanae . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath13 is the flux per angstrom , recorded in data such as @xcite in units of adu per pixel , and @xmath14 is the flux per unit frequency , calibrated to true energy units in the study of @xcite .",
    "we are motivated to define a g band index that is valid across a wide range of metallicity for use in studies of carbon and nitrogen abundances in bright globular cluster red giants .",
    "since this region of the spectrum has broad cn features as well as broad ch features , minimal dependence on nitrogen abundance is an important criterion for our index definition , in addition to predictable , monotonic dependence on overall stellar metallicity and [ c / fe ] .",
    "this is doubly important in light of the work we intend to use this index for , converting ch and 3883@xmath0 cn bandstrengths to carbon and nitrogen abundances to study the rate of ongoing cn(o)-cycle processing in globular cluster red giants .    in the present analysis",
    ", we use a large grid of synthetic spectra generated with marcs model atmospheres @xcite and the ssg spectrum - synthesis code ( bell et al .",

    "the tests with 5% and 10% error are less encouraging : while the shape of the @xmath47[c / fe ] distribution remains the same in all panels of figure 10 , the standard deviation @xmath56}}$ ] roughly doubles with each increase in noise . again restricting the abundance range to the region where globular cluster red giants are mostly likely to be found , the mean value for @xmath47[c / fe ] and percentage of stars falling in the range @xmath54[c / fe ] @xmath58 are @xmath71 and 27% , respectively , for the 5%-error case and @xmath71 and 14% , for the 10%-error case .",
    "this implies that [ c / fe ] abundances derived from @xmath1 ( or any other g - band index ) should only be trusted when the original spectra have decently high signal to noise ratios : @xmath47[c / fe ] is unacceptably large in the 10% error case , and is marginal in stars with typical globular cluster abundances in the 5% error case .",
    "values determined using @xmath1 , and [ c / fe ] values from @xcite , for four giants in m13 observed by the authors as part of an ongoing study . while there is a fairly predictable relationship between the two sets of measurements , there is clearly an offset between the zeropoints of the two carbon abundance scales . ]",
    "it is important to test our new index on data , and not just noise - injected synthetic spectra , to demonstrate that it does return reliable [ c / fe ] abundance values .",
    "figure 11 shows a comparison of [ c / fe ] values derived from @xmath1 with [ c / fe ] values taken from the literature compilation of @xcite ( originally reported in suntzeff 1981 ) , for four m13 giants observed by the present authors as part of an ongoing study of carbon depletion in globular cluster red giants .",
    "the spectra were taken with the kast double spectrograph on the 3-meter shane telescope at lick observatory , and have moderate resolution ( r@xmath72 ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra were smoothed to match the data resolution and pixel spacing .",
    "carbon abundances were derived from measured @xmath1 bandstrengths through an index - matching process similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "figure 11 shows a clear linear relationship between the @xcite [ c / fe ] abundances and the [ c / fe ] values based on @xmath1 for the four stars in common between the samples , though the abundance scales defined by the two different abundance - determination methods have different zeropoints .",
    "the magnitude of the offset between the two abundance scales is quite similar to that reported in @xcite , roughly @xmath73 dex . in @xcite",
    "the authors find that abundance - scale offset between @xcite [ c / fe ] abundances and those reported in studies using marcs model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "our carbon abundances based on @xmath1 can therefore be readily compared with other marcs - based abundance determinations , and reliably transformed onto the abundance scale of @xcite and compared with other measurements made on that scale .",
    "figure 12 shows method - based errors for carbon abundances as a function of [ fe / h ] , analogous to the leftmost panel of figure 9 , but expanded to show the same result calculated using the indices @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "both of these indices were defined for studies of one particular globular cluster , @xmath2 for the low - metallicity cluster m53 and @xmath4 for the moderate - metallicity cluster m13 , and therefore return small errors at and below those clusters respective metallicities .",
    "the leftmost panel in figure 12 is identical to the leftmost panel in figure 9 , and the vertical range is the same in all three panels . the mean value in the central panel of figure 12 , the difference between input and measured carbon abundances calculated using @xmath2 , is -0.035 , and 69% of trials fall in the range @xmath54[c / fe]@xmath74 . in the rightmost panel , which shows the difference between input and measured carbon abundances calculated from @xmath4 , the mean value is 0.007 , and 86% of trials have @xmath54[c / fe]@xmath75 .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath1 index over these other two is that it has been designed to be fairly insensitive to [ fe / h ] and [ n / fe ] , resulting in a smaller overall range of @xmath47[c / fe ] errors across a wide range of [ fe / h ] , [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] .    [ c / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for @xmath46 randomly - chosen ( [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] ) abundance points within our model grid . in the leftmost panel , @xmath47[c / fe ]",
    "was calculated from measurements of @xmath1 ; in the center , from @xmath2 , and on the right , @xmath4 .",
    "the vertical scale in all three panels is identical . ]",
    "it is our hope that this new g - band index can provide a standard tool for low - resolution spectroscopic studies of bright red giants in globular clusters .",
    "it is simultaneously more sensitive to [ c / fe ] and less sensitive to [ n / fe ] than similar indices used in the literature to date , and would allow for useful comparison and combination of independent researchers data in multiple globular clusters .",
    "the optimization method used here could be generally applicable to any spectral region where there are a few main parameters controlling the strength of an absorption or emission feature .",
    "our characterizations of the dependence of @xmath1 on [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , and [ n / fe ] , as well as the error associated with converting @xmath1 to [ c / fe ] , apply over a wide abundance range , but they are only strictly true for stars with @xmath15 , since the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra were only calculated for that particular value . while our current model calibration of @xmath1 should lead to a reliable measure of [ c / fe ] for a moderate range in @xmath76 , perhaps @xmath77 , it should not be applied to stars outside this magnitude range without recalibration . since the index was designed specifically for bright red giants of population ii metallicities , we do not recommend using it to study [ c / fe ] in stars belonging to significantly different populations .                                ,",
