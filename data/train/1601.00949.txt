    "thanks to the advance of modern x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , and the synergy with radio observations , we now know that isolated neutron stars ( nss ) can manifest themselves as pulsars ( psrs ) with a surface dipole magnetic field spanning more than five orders of magnitude , in the @xmath210@xmath310@xmath4  g range .",
    "observationally , this has led to their organization into different classes , including ( 1 ) the rotationally powered radio and x - ray bright objects , like the vela pulsar with @xmath5@xmath2@xmath6@xmath7  g , ( 2 ) the magnetically powered pulsars ( or magnetars ) with @xmath5@xmath2@xmath8@xmath9  g , exceeding the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) limit of @xmath10 g and observed primarily at high energies , ( 3 ) the highly magnetized pulsars ( hbps ) with magnetic fields intermediate between the classical pulsars and magnetars , but still exceeding the qed limit , and ( 4 ) the central compact objects ( ccos ) observed only in x - rays ( so far ) , near the centres of supernova remnants ( snrs ) and with inferred low magnetic fields , @xmath5@xmath210@xmath310@xmath11  g. this diversity led several authors to attempt a unification through evolutionary models of nss with their properties dictated primarily by a continuum of magnetic field strengths ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the magnetic field is estimated using a standard model of ns evolution which assumes energy loss due to the emission of radiation from a point - like rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum , providing a spin - down torque with a braking index @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this picture assumes rapid rotation of the ns after birth , so the observed period ( @xmath13 ) differs from the initial period ( @xmath14 ) by a large amount ( i.e. @xmath15 ) due to the constant torque acting to slow the ns spin @xcite .",
    "however , the braking index has been measured for a small sample of young pulsars , and all so far differ from the prediction of the standard model with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a lower braking index can come about from a variety of mechanisms including a change in the moment of inertia of the star over time @xcite , alignment of the magnetic field and rotation axis @xcite , the emission of a particle wind @xcite , magnetospheric effects @xcite and environmental interactions @xcite .",
    "another serious problem with the standard picture concerns the nss that are associated with snrs .",
    "generally , pulsar ages found from their ` characteristic age ' ( @xmath17 ) by assuming dipole radiation and the independently measured snr ages are in disagreement , sometimes by orders of magnitude ( in particular for the ccos ) .",
    "the observed braking index and age discrepancy arise from the standard , and commonly adopted , assumption of a constant torque acting to brake the ns over its life span .",
    "the growing evidence for nss with x - ray luminosity in excess of their spin - down energy presents another difficulty for the standard scenario .",
    "some of these objects are thought to be powered by the dissipation of magnetic energy rather than spin - down losses , examples of which include the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and some soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , unified under the class of ` magnetars ' @xcite .",
    "these are x - ray bright objects that are slowly rotating pulsars with exceptionally high magnetic fields and normally discovered through their bursting activity .",
    "however , a neat classification scheme for these objects proves elusive in the light of the discovery of ` low - b magnetars ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an hbp having behaved like a magnetar , yet thought to be a rotation - powered pulsar powering a bright pulsar wind nebula @xcite .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the ccos with extremely low fields , dubbed as ` anti - magnetars ' @xcite , yet still show an x - ray luminosity in excess of their spin - down energy .",
    "one recent interpretation for these objects is the suppression of their external field through magnetic field burial @xcite , also implied by spectroscopic models of these objects @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the accretion of supernova fall - back material occurs following the birth of the ns .",
    "this period of vigorous accretion has the effect of burying the dipole magnetic field component within the ns crust , reducing the spin - down energy loss and making the ns appear significantly older than its associated snr . in this alternative model of ns evolution ,",
    "field growth is needed to explain the initially small braking index and low surface fields , while a decaying toroidal component is invoked to explain the excess x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "the field burial scenario has been most recently described in significant detail by @xcite , who performed detailed calculations of the fall - back accretion process , including the inner structure of the ns , conductivity of the ns crust and a realistic equation of state . besides an internal decaying toroidal component",
    ", the dipole field component also decays on large time - scales @xcite .",
    "the decaying external field is described by a parametrized model given by @xcite , expanded on by @xcite and used to describe the evolution of the axp 1e  2259 + 586 by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a phenomenological parametrized family of models for magnetic field evolution in the ns population .",
    "our model unifies the description of magnetic field growth and decay by making use of variations on the parametric forms from @xcite and @xcite , which we derive in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "this model also reproduces the results of @xcite for exponential field growth and replicates the findings of @xcite for decaying fields .",
    "we fit our model to the observations of various nss in section [ sec : modelfitting ] , testing our model against the detailed physical predictions found by @xcite .",
    "we discuss the results of our fits in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the standard model for ns spin - down from energy loss due to the emission of dipole radiation assumes a constant magnetic field @xmath18 , where @xmath13 and @xmath19 are the period and period derivative , respectively .",
    "however , we are interested in the dynamical evolution of the magnetic field @xmath20 where the time - dependence has been gathered into the function @xmath21 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath22 is a constant reference field value , either the initial field strength in decay models ( denoted by subscript @xmath23 ) or final field strength in growth models ( labelled as @xmath24 ) .",
    "we use the differential equation @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and do not consider the effect of spin - axis field alignment . integrating this equation from the nss birth at @xmath27 to an arbitrary later time @xmath28 ,",
    "we find @xmath29 where we have denoted the integral @xmath30 from here on , we will generally suppress the time - dependence of the function @xmath31 for notational simplicity .",
    "the period derivative is @xmath32 and we express the characteristic age , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 where we have used equation ( [ dotp ] ) . inserting equation ( [ p ] ) in this expression gives us @xmath35 including a time - dependent field introduces an important distinction between the characteristic age @xmath33 and the model time @xmath28 .",
    "the model time represents the amount of time elapsed from the birth of the ns to the present , and thus represents the `` true '' age of the ns .",
    "the characteristic age is the age that is determined from the period and period derivative of the ns ( equation [ ttau1 ] ) , which differs from the true age due to the time - dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "these dynamical quantities also introduce a time - dependence of the braking index @xmath36 . using equation ( [ p ] ) ,",
    "the braking index is given by @xmath37 if the field decays , @xmath38 is negative and @xmath39 , while field growth has positive @xmath38 and leads to a braking index @xmath16 as observed in many young nss . in the case of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and",
    "these formulae reduce to the standard spin - down from dipole radiation with a constant field .",
    "@xcite use a parametrization to study field decay that was introduced by @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the decay index that describes how rapidly the decay proceeds and @xmath44 is a normalization parameter related to the specific physical mechanisms involved in the decay ( e.g. hall drift , ambipolar diffusion ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath45^{-1}$ ] is the decay time - scale , which itself is time - dependent .",
    "the magnetic field described by these equations can be conveniently written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the initial field which decays over time , and @xmath48 is the initial field decay time - scale .",
    "note that the time - dependence of the decaying field given in equation ( [ decayb ] ) , @xmath49 , is contained entirely within the dimensionless function @xmath50 .",
    "this well - known parametrization is extremely useful as it can also be used to construct a model of field growth .",
    "there are a number of properties the dimensionless function @xmath51 must have in order to describe ns field growth .",
    "the growth must be bounded in time , in that the field begins at some minimum value and attains an asymptotic maximum value as time increases .",
    "this requires that the derivative of the field growth function is always positive and decreases to approach zero as @xmath28 becomes large .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 should be parametrized in terms of a small number of quantities whose meaning has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , the field decay function @xmath50 has attractive features that make it useful to also describe the derivative of a growing field @xmath52 .",
    "first , the function decreases from a maximum @xmath53 and becomes vanishingly small for large @xmath28 .",
    "this bounded behaviour fulfills the exact criteria that is required to describe the derivative of a field @xmath52 that begins at a minimum value and grows to approach a constant strength as @xmath28 increases .",
    "secondly , @xmath50 is stated in terms of two parameters that have a well - understood interpretation .",
    "the index @xmath43 controls the rate at which @xmath50 changes with respect to @xmath28 , with lower values giving the field evolution an exponential behaviour , and larger values slow the evolution providing a softer decay .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 controls the time - scale over which the magnetic field evolves .",
    "therefore , let us consider the following basic form based on the field decay @xmath50 from @xcite , with an appropriate normalization , as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the time - dependent part of the growing field and @xmath57 contains the time - dependence of the decaying field model , normalized by the factor @xmath58 . due to this normalization , growing fields require the field index to be in the range @xmath59",
    ". equation [ bderiv ] results in a field that evolves in time as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 in the above expression the integration constant @xmath62 controls the initial field @xmath63 in terms of the asymptotic value at large @xmath28 , @xmath64 .",
    "the growth model uses the boundary condition @xmath65 as the asymptotic field strength , and the decay model uses @xmath66 as the initial field . in terms of fields buried by fall - back accretion , the smaller",
    "@xmath62 is , the deeper the field has been buried within the ns , and the larger the difference between the initial and asymptotic field strength .",
    "the time - scale @xmath67 determines how long the field takes to emerge from the compact object .",
    "the field given by equation ( [ fg ] ) describes a family of solutions in terms of the field index @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath68 the field evolves exponentially , which is particularly significant as this form was proposed by @xcite to describe growing ns fields . when @xmath69 , field growth occurs more slowly . since",
    "the parameters of our growth model are given by the widely studied decaying field parametrization of @xcite and @xcite , we find this representation to be particularly intuitive .",
    "the period @xmath13 and characteristic age @xmath33 given by equations ( [ p ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) depend on the integral of @xmath70 ( equation [ f_j^2 ] ) . with the time - dependence from equation ( [ fg ] ) ,",

    "the model time can be treated as a free parameter to vary between the lower and upper snr age limits , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , or can be fixed before beginning the optimization .",
    "the model then outputs the quantities we want to fit to the observed values : the period , period derivative and braking index ( at the present time ) . the standard fitting problem is to vary the input parameters to produce a match with the output and the observed values .",
    "thus , the problem is under constrained , in that there are fewer fit quantities than parameters , leading to a family of solutions .",

    "knowledge of the characteristic age allows us to state the initial period as a function of the parameters , given by solving equation ( [ tau ] ) : @xmath110 restating the problem in this way is advantageous because it allows us to eliminate what was previously considered a free parameter , and treats the snr age and braking index as quantities to fit .",
    "the simplification we introduce comes from reducing the number of parameters to a small enough set that a quantitative description of the model parameter space can be given , as described furthermore below .",
    "the introduction of additional physics beyond the phenomenological field growth also helps further simplify the situation .",
    "we describe the model parameter space by fixing the values of the field index @xmath43 and the growth factor @xmath62 . for a given calculation",
    "we hold these values constant .",
    "next , we form a grid of @xmath54 and @xmath102 values and calculate @xmath28 and @xmath0 for each ( @xmath54 , @xmath102 ) pair using equations ( [ tmodel ] ) and ( [ n ] )",

    "thus , while this method does not provide a unique solution , it allows us to quantify the regions of parameter space that contain physical solutions given a constant @xmath43 and @xmath62 pair as input .",
    "we investigate the differences between the low- and high-@xmath43 cases to study the limiting behaviour of the field growth model .",
    "generally , the solutions that have observed fields close to the asymptotic field @xmath102 are near the end of their evolution .",
    "the @xmath123 , @xmath115 solutions with the lowest asymptotic fields have nearly finished their evolution and will grow by only @xmath126 over the next few kyr .",

    "these nss will take a significantly longer span of time for their fields to evolve to the final state and reach braking index @xmath12 .",
    "for these solutions , the field growth significantly outlasts the observable life of the snr and will appear as a highly magnetized , isolated ns with no apparent snr association .",
    "let us investigate the consequences of field growth in nss using two initial approaches .",
    "first , we vary the field index @xmath43 to demonstrate how this parameter affects the time evolution . secondly ,",
    "since this field growth model is phenomenological in nature , we investigate how well it can reproduce the results of numerical simulations , such as the detailed modelling of the burial and emergence of the magnetic fields in young accreting nss explored recently by @xcite .",

    "the parameters that describe the trajectories shown in this figure are likewise given in table [ table : fitpar ] .",
    "note that we do not provide an example trajectory for hbp  j11196127 , which will be discussed in the next section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] , we plot the characteristic age against the model time , following the same conventions as fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] . despite the apparent similarity of many of the trajectories in the @xmath13@xmath19 phase space ,",
    "the @xmath33@xmath28 plot clearly shows the difference between these objects as a function of time .",
    "it is worth noting that the time evolution of the ccos characteristic age explains the apparent large discrepancy between the pulsars adopted ages ( appearing very old ) and their associated young snrs . in particular , for the three systems shown , the psr and snr ages match at times equal to or exceeding @xmath293 yr , by which time the snr would have mostly dissipated .",
    "therefore , the characteristic age for these objects considered will not reflect their true age as long as they are within their snrs .",
    "this feature , along with the low asymptotic field strength ( see table [ table : fitpar ] ) , also leads to the suggestion that ccos could be ancestors of ` old ' isolated radio pulsars as long as they overcome the accretion or field - growth phase ( which would explain their x - ray dominant emission ) and their surface field grows to the critical limit required for radio emission .",
    "the late time evolution of the ccos may also link them to the class of objects known as x - ray dim isolated nss ( xdins ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these are radio - quiet x - ray pulsars with long periods ( @xmath294@xmath295 s ) and no apparent snr associations .",
    "some of these objects are believed to have high magnetic fields in excess of @xmath7 g.",
    "the @xmath13-@xmath19 phase space trajectories shown in fig . [ fig : phasespace ] demonstrate possible evolutionary links between the apparently diverse set of nss shown in table [ table : fitpar ] .",
    "as the ns fields grow , they evolve from the bottom of the figure upward , passing through the region of the phase space inhabited by the ccos .",
    "thus the psrs j05376910 and b083345 , and the hbps j18460258 and j17343333 may have undergone a similar cco stage during their evolution .",
    "the trajectories of these hbps carry them towards the current position of axp 1e2259 + 586 .",
    "if hbps and axps are related through evolution then field decay must begin once the buried field has emerged , raising the braking index to values @xmath39 .",
    "we have also fit the ccos to explore their potential future behaviour , and note that rx  j0822.04300 has asymptotic behaviour for both large and small fields which is very close to psr  b083345 .",
    "however , the time evolution of these objects is dramatically different as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] .",
    "thus , objects like the hbps may pass through the cco stage relatively quickly , whereas objects such as cco  1e  1207.45209 spend a more significant portion of their lives in this state .",
    "finally , we note that cco  cxou  j185238.6 + 004020 requires an extremely low asymptotic field , with @xmath296 g. thus , even after the field emerges from this ns , it remains relatively low .",
    "since the sgrs 052766 and 162741 have characteristic ages less than the upper snr age limit , we have also examined these objects using the growth model .",
    "however , the field growth mechanism is not generally expected to play a role in the evolution of the sgrs , since their characteristic ages are only smaller than the upper limit of the associated snr age , and no lower limits are known .",
    "moreover , these systems do not have a measured braking index , which is crucial in making the case for field growth ( @xmath16 ) or field decay ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "additionally , field decay has been proposed to explain the sgrs energetics as it has for axps , although their x - ray luminosity is not consistently larger than their spin - down energy . due to the lack of a lower age limit",
    ", we consider solutions that produce @xmath297 .",
    "generally solutions that satisfy this condition with large @xmath102 require a longer growth time - scale for a given @xmath43 and @xmath62 pair , so we can find large fields @xmath298 g provided we consider sufficiently large @xmath54 .",
    "we plot the evolution of two example solutions in figs [ fig : phasespace ] and [ fig : age ] .",
    "interestingly , both sgr  162741 and sgr  052766 reach similar states in the limit of large asymptotic fields shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] , and the trajectories imply the sgr fields are still evolving . a lower limit for the snr age would significantly constrain these results , provided that @xmath299 . for completion",
    ", we attempted fits to the axps as well , but these required unrealistically high initial spin periods .",
    "we stress that despite these interesting fits , field decay is necessary to reconcile the characteristic and snr ages of the axps .",
    "this conclusion is supported by results from the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is implied for the sgrs evolution as well @xcite .",
    "hbp  j18460258 presents an interesting case since the braking index has been observed to decrease from @xmath300 to @xmath301 @xcite following an outburst and spectral changes in 2008 @xcite .",
    "this braking index change was not accompanied by a change in luminosity or pulse profile which is difficult to explain on such short time - scales , but may represent a re - organization of the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "we fit the pre- and post - outburst configurations of the system which we label as a ( @xmath300 ) and b(@xmath302 ) . however , we were not able to find any region of parameter space through our contour methods that could simultaneously satisfy both pre- and post - outburst configurations .",
    "this may not be the case if the field index were allowed to vary in time , but with constant @xmath43 , field growth can not neatly explain the behaviour of this ns .",
    "the hbp  j18460258 is a complicated case , particularly because of the presence of a bright pulsar wind nebula powered by this object .",
    "this nebula implies wind - braking likely plays an important role in the evolution of this ns . for @xmath303 and minimum @xmath304",
    ", we find a maximum field @xmath305 g on a growth time - scale @xmath306 kyr .",
    "changing @xmath43 and @xmath62 results in a lower field on shorter time - scales .",
    "for a given pair of @xmath43 and @xmath62 , the system can be well constrained by the period condition and the snr age , though low remnant ages are generally favoured .",
    "finally , there was a problem fitting to hbp  j11196127 .",
    "for this system we were not able to simultaneously fit both the age of the associated snr g292.20.5 @xcite , and the observed braking index @xmath307 @xcite . with the snr age constraint",
    "the derived braking index is @xmath308 assuming @xmath309 kyr .",
    "alternatively , with the braking index constraint in place , the derived age was found to be close to the characteristic age , and can not be reconciled with the observed snr age .",
    "intriguingly , a low value for the braking index of j11196127 was also proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the braking index may have recently changed from a lower value @xmath310 .",
    "since neither of these scenarios satisfies the constraints , we have not included an evolutionary track for hbp  j11196127 in figs [ fig : phasespace ] and [ fig : age ] , and also exclude it from our summary of solutions in table [ table : fitpar ] .",
    "we plan to investigate hbp  j11196127 with other emission mechanisms in future work .",
    "it is also relevant that many of the systems included in table [ table : fitpar ] have large initial spin periods ( i.e. @xmath311 s , and approaching @xmath13 for many systems ) , which are higher than expected for the traditional magnetar model @xcite .",
    "this is notable because a problem with the magnetar model is the lack of super energetic snrs which would be expected from an snr hosting a rapidly spinning proto - ns ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have devised a flexible and conveniently parametrized model for a growing magnetic field , which is based on the parametric forms used by @xcite and refined by @xcite .",
    "this parametrization can accommodate a variety of field time - dependence in addition to the exponential model suggested by @xcite , and the interpretation of the parameters is straightforward . by including the observationally measured period and period derivative and assuming the field index and growth parameter @xmath62 constant , we are able to study the portions of the parameter space containing solutions which reproduce the observables , without the need for an external optimization routine . we have shown that this phenomenological model is able to reproduce the detailed simulations of field growth by @xcite to high accuracy . by fitting the hbps securely associated with snrs with known ages and measured braking indices , we found interesting evolutionary trajectories for the systems in phase space .",
    "we conclude that if field growth is significant in the life cycle of hbps , then they may be closely related to the ccos early in their evolutionary histories .",
    "the end result of the field growth in ccos may connect these objects to the hbps and xdinss .",
    "we also investigate the possibility of field growth in sgrs , however , the behaviour of these systems are largely unconstrained due to the absence of a lower snr age limit and lack of measured braking index .",
    "field growth is not applicable to the axps , which require field decay to explain the observed difference in psr and snr ages , and a growing field is not necessary to explain the sgrs , provided that the characteristic age is larger than the true snr age .",
    "thus , in the context of magnetic field evolution , we conclude that both field growth and decay processes are required to explain the diverse population of nss .",
    "once the field has reached its asymptotic value , field decay may begin , increasing the braking index to values @xmath39 later in life .",
    "thus , the time dependence of magnetic fields provides an interesting avenue to unify the population of nss , and in particular , explain the apparently large characteristic ages for systems associated with relatively young snrs .    while this evolutionary picture is simple and based on a phenomenological model ,",
    "there are many emission mechanisms which have been proposed in the literature to solve the braking index and psr  snr age discrepancy problems .",
    "the field growth model was shown to be ineffective in explaining the constraints present in the hbp  j11196127 and the time evolution of hbp  j18460258 , both of which are associated with pulsar wind nebulae . in a follow - up paper , we will thoroughly investigate alternatives to the physical emission mechanisms at work in these and various other classes of objects and the subsequent implications for the psr  snr association and evolution .",
